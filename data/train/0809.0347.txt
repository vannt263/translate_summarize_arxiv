    "in the higgs mechanism of the standard model , the fermions and weak gauge bosons acquire mass via interaction with the higgs field which is described by a complex doublet .",
    "three of the four real fields of the doublet couple to the su(2 ) gauge bosons .",
    "the observable quantum of the fourth higgs field is called the higgs boson .",
    "the existence of this undiscovered particle is the cornerstone of the standard model@xcite .",
    "direct searches performed with the lep experiments have constrained the higgs mass to be larger than 114.4 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . in @xmath4 collisions at the tevatron ,",
    "the most probable production mode of the higgs is by gluon fusion through a virtual top loop .",
    "around 70% of the higgs would decay into two @xmath2-quarks yielding two @xmath2-jets in the final state .",
    "since the qcd @xmath2-quark production is an irreducible background , this analysis would have a low sensitivity .",
    "the second most frequent production mode is when a virtual w or z decays into a w or z and a higgs . in this case , it is possible to trigger on the decay products of the w / z boson and significantly reduce the qcd background .",
    "we are analyzing z - higgs and w - higgs associated productions when the z decays into two neutrinos , or the w decays leptonically but the charged lepton escapes the detection . because the neutrinos will not be detected in the calorimeter , either , they lead to an unbalanced transverse energy sum in the transverse plain ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we use data collected through march 2007 , which corresponds to 1.7 @xmath3 integrated luminosity .",
    "the events are collected by cdf ii detector with a trigger that selects events with @xmath5 gev at level 1 at least two level 2 clusters with @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev at level 3 .    in the first step of the analysis ,",
    "both the monte carlo and real data events are to pass a set of quality cuts to ensure that the possible beam and detector effects are removed from the data sample making it compatible with the simulation .",
    "the standard cdf jet clustering algorithm is used @xcite with a jet cone of radius 0.4 .",
    "jet energies are corrected for calorimeter non - uniformity , non - linearity and energy loss in the un - instrumented regions of calorimeter and energy coming from different @xmath8 interactions during the same bunch crossing .",
    "the @xmath1 of the event is then corrected with new jet energies .",
    "the trigger efficiency is obtained from data and is used to scale the signal and monte - carlo backgrounds to correct for event loss during data taking .",
    "the efficiency of the two - jet requirement is 100% if the offline transverse energy of the most energetic jet is above 35 gev , the second most energetic jet is above 25 gev , and at least one of the jets has @xmath9 .",
    "the overall efficiency of the online event selection is then parameterized by the offline corrected @xmath1 and applied on the monte carlo samples providing a proper scaling for the simulated events .    the final requirement imposed on the data and simulation before comparing them is the @xmath2-tag requirement .",
    "we use two categories of secvtx @xmath2-tagging algorithm @xcite , tight and loose .",
    "the main difference between the loose and tight tagging algorithms is that the loose tagger has more efficient track selection .",
    "the @xmath2-tagging efficiency for tight ( loose ) tagger is @xmath10 40% ( 50% ) and mistag rate is @xmath10 2% ( 4% ) . in this analysis events",
    "are split into two exclusive categories : events with 2 jets tagged by secvtx loose algorithm or exactly one jet tagged by secvtx tight algorithm .",
    "the backgrounds in this data sample have contributions from the following processes : qcd multi - jet production , top quark pair and single production , w or z boson production with jets and diboson production ( ww , wz , zz ) .",
    "we simulate processes which yield real taggable objects , that is , when a @xmath2- or a @xmath11-quark pair is created .",
    "events with light flavor jets with a positive tag are considered to be mistags and are estimated from the data@xcite .",
    "the remaining background processes were generated with pythia@xcite monte carlo event generator passed through cdf ii detector simulation .",
    "after defining two control regions in the events passing the basic selection criteria , the standard model background is compared to the data . in the first control region ( cr1 )",
    "all events with identified leptons are vetoed , and the azimuthal angular separation between the second leading jet and the @xmath1 is less than 0.4 .",
    "this control region is dominated by qcd multi - jet events .",
    "the second control region ( cr2 ) contains events with at least one lepton or isolated track and @xmath12 .",
    "this region is sensitive to electroweak processes , and is used to check the overall shapes and normalizations of the monte carlo simulated processes .",
    ".number of expected background and observed events in the control regions [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "improvements of the analysis technique are being developed to further increase the sensitivity of the analysis .",
    "below we summarize the progress in the main directions that are pursued .",
    "one of the main challenges in this search channel is the modeling of the large qcd multi - jet background .",
    "a model to estimate this background directly from data has been developed . in order to estimate the multi - jet background in the single - tagged sample we measure the probability to tag one jet from the `` pretag '' sample .",
    "similarly , to estimate the multi - jet background in the double - tagged sample we measure the probability to tag a jet in a sample that already has one jet tagged .",
    "this method allows us to estimate the shapes and normalizations for multi - jet production in single - tagged and double - tagged categories , fig.[fig : cr_imp_plots_mjjj ] .    in order to increase the acceptance to the higgs signal",
    "we accept events with three jets , for the first time at cdf in this channel .",
    "the main motivation is to accept events where one of the @xmath2 quarks coming from the higgs radiates a gluon .",
    "in addition to that , we also accept wh events where the charged lepton coming from the w is reconstructed as a jet .",
    "the latter case happens when the w decays to an electron and it fails the cdf electron identification algorithm , but is reconstructed as a jet ; or when the w decays to @xmath13 and @xmath14hadrons . as can be seen from fig.[fig : cr_imp_plots_njet ] our background prediction for jet multiplicity agrees very well with the observed data .    in order to effectively reduce the large qcd background , we need to get a good estimate of the event true missing energy .",
    "we do that by calculating the @xmath15 , which is defined as the negative vectorial sum of charged particle @xmath16 s . for events with true @xmath1 the @xmath15 is highly correlated and parallel with calorimeter @xmath1 , while for qcd events with mismeasured jets it is not . as shown in fig.[fig : cr_imp_plots_mptmet ]",
    "the @xmath17 can serve as an excellent kinematic variable to discern real from fake @xmath1",
    ".    for searches of @xmath18 decays it is crucial to precisely meausure the energies of the jets coming from the @xmath2-quarks .",
    "an algorithm similar to the one used by h1 collaboration @xcite has been implemented , which combines tracks and calorimeter towers to improve the reconstruction of the jets energies .",
    "initial studies show that an improvement of @xmath19 in dijet mass resolution can be achieved .",
    "to further increase the final discriminant sensitivity , we are developing an artificial neural network to maximally separate higgs boson signal from backgrounds .    in summary ,",
    "we have performed a direct search for the standard model higgs boson decaying into @xmath2-jet pairs in 1.7 @xmath3 data accumulated in run ii of the cdf detector .",
    "we do not observe any significant excess over the background predicted by the standard model , thus we set a 95 % c.l .",
    "upper limit for the higgs boson at various masses .",
    "multiple improvements in the analysis technique are being developed and will be incorporated in the next iterations of the analysis ."
