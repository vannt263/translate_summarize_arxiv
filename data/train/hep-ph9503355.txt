    "<S> we propose a criterion to classify hybrid defects occuring in field theoretic models such as the standard electroweak model . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion leads us to consider the minimal extension of the electroweak model in which electroweak magnetic monopoles and @xmath0-strings are topological . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the cosmology of such defects .    </S>",

    "<S> _    \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> truecm    the standard electroweak model is based on an @xmath2 symmetry group with the order parameter @xmath3 being an @xmath4 doublet . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the symmetry breaks down to the electromagnetic @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> given this symmetry breaking scheme , one finds that the vacuum manifold is a three sphere which has trivial first and second homotopy groups . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there are no topological monopoles and strings in the electroweak model </S>",
    "<S> . however , these topological considerations are blind to any _ confined defects _ @xcite that may be present in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the standard model of the electroweak interactions contains confined magnetic monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these magnetic monopoles are confined by nielsen - olesen strings @xcite which carry magnetic flux of the @xmath0 boson @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the @xmath0-strings can be viewed as being due to the embedding of topological defects within the standard model @xcite . but this viewpoint does not apply to the monopole and a somewhat different reasoning must be used to understand the existence of magnetic monopoles in the standard model .    </S>",
    "<S> how might we detect confined defects from the topology of the model ? </S>",
    "<S> a topological scheme which is sensitive to confined defects follows once we realize that when an order parameter acquires a vev , composite operators ( suitably normal ordered ) that can be built from the order parameter can also acquire vevs . </S>",
    "<S> the vev of these composite operators yields different symmetry breaking patterns with vacuum manifolds which have different topological properties . </S>",
    "<S> if the vacuum manifold resulting from the vev of a composite operator has non - trivial first or second homotopy groups , we can get confined strings or confined monopoles .    </S>",
    "<S> this scheme for classifying confined defects can be illustrated in the case of the standard model . here , when @xmath3 acquires a vev , the composite operator @xmath6 also acquires a vev . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have used standard notation such as given in @xcite and normal ordered with respect to the @xmath3 ground state vacuum ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath7 transforms in the adjoint representation of @xmath4 and is a singlet under @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> so the vev of @xmath7 breaks @xmath4 to @xmath9 and the vacuum manifold is @xmath10 with a non - trivial second homotopy group . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there are magnetic monopoles present in the model . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , nambu s electroweak magnetic monopole is precisely a hedgehog in the @xmath7 field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason the monopoles are confined is that the relation ( [ chi ] ) for a hedgehog configuration of @xmath7 can not be globally inverted to give a non - vanishing field configuration for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there is a line emanating from the monopole along which @xmath3 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this is the location of the @xmath11string attached to the monopole . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11string is _ not _ a dirac string that returns the electromagnetic flux ; it is a string that confines the magnetic monopole without having anything to do with the electromagnetic flux .    </S>",
    "<S> even higher dimensional representation operators can be constructed from @xmath3 and these will yield other confined defects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the 5 dimensional representation of @xmath4 constructed using @xmath12 will break @xmath13 to @xmath14 yielding an even richer array of confined topological defects such as alice strings bounded by walls . here </S>",
    "<S> we will not discuss this very interesting issue further but restrict our attention to electroweak magnetic monopoles and @xmath11strings .    </S>",
    "<S> having realised that the monopoles are hedgehogs in the composite real scalar field @xmath7 , we can promote the monopoles to being truly topological objects by promoting @xmath7 to be a fundamental field . </S>",
    "<S> so the lagrangian we will consider is : @xmath15 where , @xmath16 is the gradient part of the bosonic sector of the electroweak lagrangian , @xmath17 is the fermionic part of the lagrangian , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and , @xmath20 if we impose an additional @xmath21 symmetry on the lagrangian under @xmath22 the symmetry is @xmath23 and we must set @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , we shall only consider this case and henceforth ignore the last ( cubic ) term in the potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the vev of @xmath3 breaks the symmetry down to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the leptons and quarks do not couple to @xmath7 since we have imposed the @xmath21 symmetry on @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because there is no lorentz invariant dimension four operator that can be constructed using the left - handed fermion @xmath27 doublets and the @xmath28 field which is a triplet and still be invariant under the @xmath21 transformation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath17 is identical to the fermionic lagrangian of the standard electroweak model .    at non - zero temperatures , the coefficients in the potential </S>",
    "<S> will get thermal corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order corrections give : @xmath29 where @xmath30   \\label{beta2}\\ ] ] and @xmath31 \\quad . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{beta3}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the @xmath4 and @xmath8 gauge coupling constants , respectively ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the yukawa couplings between the higgs triplet and doublet , and the matter fermions ; @xmath36 is 3 for quarks and 1 for leptons . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is bounded from below if @xmath38 and @xmath39 we make the simplifying but unnecessary assumption that the full symmetry of the theory ( here @xmath40 ) is restored at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this requires @xmath41 spontaneous symmetry breaking is signaled when @xmath42 drops below either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we would like to find the minima of the potential for different temperatures and , in that way , find the symmetry breaking pattern . </S>",
    "<S> there are four different phases that can occur : phase 1 : @xmath45 ; phase 2 : @xmath46 ; phase 3 : @xmath47 ; phase 4 : @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in a similar model with a complex singlet instead of the triplet @xcite , there is a range of parameters in which the different phases occur in succession as we go from very high to low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we have explicitly checked the existence of such parameters for the model presented here . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one such set is : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are measured in units of 246 gev - the electroweak scale . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we find that phases 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 follow in succession as we cool from very high to low temperatures . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we schematically show the vevs of @xmath3 and @xmath7 as functions of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this then yields the following symmetry breaking pattern : @xmath53 where in the last stage the vev of @xmath7 vanishes and this restores the @xmath21 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the group @xmath9 is a subgroup of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the generator @xmath54 of the electromagnetic group @xmath5 is a linear combination of @xmath55 - the generator of @xmath9 and @xmath56 - the generator of @xmath8 : @xmath57 the first stage of symmetry breaking now produces topological magnetic monopoles in the way they would be produced in the georgi - glashow model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flux emanating from these monopoles is of the @xmath9 magnetic field . at the next symmetry breaking , a fraction of this flux becomes massive and gets squeezed into flux tubes - these are the @xmath11strings attached to the monopoles - while the remaining flux is massless electromagnetic flux - this is the magnetic flux emanating from electroweak monopoles . during this second symmetry breaking a distribution of closed loops of @xmath11string </S>",
    "<S> will also be produced . </S>",
    "<S> note that these strings can break by the formation of monopole pairs but this process is exponentially suppressed since the monopoles are assumed to be very heavy compared to the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of the @xmath21 symmetry group in the second stage produces domain walls but these will dissolve in the last stage when the @xmath21 is restored .    </S>",
    "<S> this scheme can readily be put in a grand unification model because triplets occur quite naturally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in minimal @xmath58 grand unification , the breaking to @xmath59 is accomplished with a higgs @xmath60 ; twelve of these are eaten as the @xmath61 and @xmath56 bosons become massive ; of the remaining twelve higgses three are in an @xmath4 triplet that can be identified with the @xmath7 field .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now discuss the structure of the defects in this model and the possible cosmological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> the monopoles that are produced in the first phase transition are hedgehogs purely in the @xmath7 field and have a mass : @xmath62 where , @xmath63 is the @xmath64 mass in phase 2 . </S>",
    "<S> when the second symmetry breaking occurs , the monopoles get connected by strings . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath64 boson mass gets a contribution from the vev of @xmath3 and is : @xmath65 therefore the mass of the monopole also changes as given by eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mmass1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strings are topological since they arise from the breaking of @xmath66 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from instanton processes resulting in the nucleation of monopole antimonopole pairs along the string @xcite , the strings are stable . </S>",
    "<S> the second symmetry breaking also yields domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the angle between the two vectors @xmath7 and @xmath67 varies as we traverse one of these walls though , depending on the parameters of the model , one of the two fields @xmath7 or @xmath3 could vanish in the interior of the wall . </S>",
    "<S> such walls are known to exist in condensed matter systems such as @xmath68he . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall not consider the domain walls in greater detail since they will go away once the @xmath21 symmetry is restored in the last stage .    in the last transition occuring at @xmath69 , the vev of @xmath7 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> ( this feature of the model means that it is unconstrained by the experimental limits on the @xmath70 parameter . ) at temperatures below @xmath69 , the strings are nearly identical to the @xmath11strings discussed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> there is however one difference which could be crucial - the strings can have a bosonic condensate @xcite of @xmath7 on them depending on the parameters of the model . to see this note that @xmath3 vanishes at the center of the string and </S>",
    "<S> so it is energetically favorable for @xmath7 to be non - vanishing in this region . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the region in the vicinity of the strings resembles the phase where both @xmath3 and @xmath7 have non - zero vevs - a phase where the strings are topologically stable . </S>",
    "<S> then there are two parameter dependent possibilities : ( i ) the @xmath0-strings are unstable at temperatures below @xmath69 , and , ( ii ) the @xmath0-strings are stabilized at temperatures below @xmath69 by the @xmath7 condensate </S>",
    "<S> . both of these possibilities may have interesting cosmological consequences .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remember that the standard model @xmath0-string is superconducting @xcite due to fermion zero modes @xcite and can carry a maximum electric current of about @xmath71 amps . in our case , the fermionic part of the lagrangian in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lag ] ) is unaffected by the presence of the @xmath7 field and the dirac equations for leptons and quarks are identical to those in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore zero modes for these particles will also exist in the extended model @xmath11string and these strings too will be able to carry up to @xmath71 amps of electric current . due to the presence of the quark zero modes , linked and </S>",
    "<S> twisted @xmath11strings will carry baryon number exactly as they do in the standard model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss the first possibility where the monopoles get connected by strings at @xmath72 and then the strings , being unstable , break up and decay by the nucleation of monopole pairs at a temperature below @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario might be interesting in the context of baryogenesis from string decay .    </S>",
    "<S> the monopoles that form at @xmath69 are specified by their location , velocity , charge and , most importantly for us , by a @xmath9 phase . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is well known that the phase of a single monopole is arbitrary since we are free to perform @xmath9 rotations . </S>",
    "<S> but in a situation where there are two or more monopoles , the _ relative _ phase of the monopoles can not be changed by such a global transformation . ) at @xmath72 , @xmath3 gets a vev and then the @xmath3 field configuration of a monopole and an antimonopole will have the following asymptotic forms : @xmath73 where , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are spherical angular coordinates centered on the monopole and antimonopole respectively and the phase @xmath76 is the arbitrary @xmath77 phase . </S>",
    "<S> these monopoles will get connected by @xmath11strings below @xmath72 and , as shown in @xcite , the monopoles plus string field configuration carries baryon number . at the time the monopoles get connected by strings </S>",
    "<S> , we expect their relative phases ( @xmath76 ) to be uncorrelated and so each connected monopole pair will carry of order @xmath78 baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the magnitude of the local baryon number density at @xmath72 is of the order of the monopole density : @xmath79    if the strings are unstable at low temperatures , they will break up into small segments below @xmath80 and these small segments will ultimately release their energy into radiation . as this decay happens relatively late </S>",
    "<S> , the strings are out of thermal equilibrium and each decay leads to the generation of baryon ( or antibaryon ) number . </S>",
    "<S> a net amount of baryon number will be produced if the cp violation effects of the km matrix are included in the string decay . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the cp violation in the monopole - string system is not yet known but , as the effect is non - perturbative , it need not be small . </S>",
    "<S> this subject deserves further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> a more exciting possibility is that the strings are stable even at low temperatures due to the @xmath7 condensate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the strings do not break up into small segments below @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the length distribution of strings is expected to be exponentially suppressed since on following a particular string - treated as a brownian walk - there is a certain non - vanishing probability that it will encounter a monopole and terminate . </S>",
    "<S> but the length scale above which the exponential fall off sets in can be quite large since it is governed by the monopole number density and the string density at @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> if the monopoles are quite dilute when the strings form , we expect a nearly scale invariant distribution of loops to be formed together with a few open string segments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of a superconducting string tangle has been discussed in several contexts in @xcite and the results are reviewed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the short string segments and loops will collapse and decay into radiation with the production of baryons . </S>",
    "<S> but , in the early universe , the longer string segments which carry currents will be frozen in the ambient plasma provided their curvature scale is larger than a critical scale . </S>",
    "<S> such strings will be stretched with the hubble expansion and will become even longer . </S>",
    "<S> on curvature scales less than the critical scale , the strings are free to oscillate </S>",
    "<S> . such sections of strings will cut across the random magnetic field that is also expected to be produced at @xmath72 @xcite and will result in an oscillating induced current on the string @xcite .    by the epoch of structure formation , most of the strings would have decayed but we can expect a few stray , frozen - in loops to survive . </S>",
    "<S> these stray loops would then get trapped in protogalaxies and in protostars . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing galactic and stellar turbulence would generate more string in a way reminiscent of the generation of vortex lines in superfluids . </S>",
    "<S> ( there too a few stray lines result in a fully developed tangle in the presence of flow @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> the energy emission from superconducting strings ( formed at the electroweak scale ) in the galaxy was discussed in @xcite and it was found that the luminosity due to all the strings would be @xmath81 ergs / s . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant but a characteristic signature of radiation from strings would further assist in observations . </S>",
    "<S> such a characteristic seems possible in the case of electroweak strings due to the role that @xmath11strings can play in baryon number violating processes . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , the scenario where a tangle of electroweak strings is present in a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> ( similar phenomena would also occur in stars . ) on curvature scales smaller than @xmath82 cm , the strings are not frozen into the galactic plasma . </S>",
    "<S> loops on this scale will cut across the galactic magnetic field and collapse on a time scale @xmath83 sec where @xmath84 cm / s is the terminal velocity of the strings moving through the galactic plasma @xcite . during this process </S>",
    "<S> an electric field is induced along the string and hence @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon number anomaly equation then gives us the rate of baryon number production during loop collapse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> order of magnitude estimates tell us that such a collapsing loop releases about @xmath86 baryons where @xmath87 is the magnetic flux that the string cuts across and @xmath88 is the @xmath11flux in the string . </S>",
    "<S> while the baryon number production due to a single loop is quite a slow process , the baryon number produced by all the loops in the galaxy can be significant - about @xmath89 baryons in @xmath90 secs . </S>",
    "<S> roughly half the baryons will be in the form of antimatter and since the strings are neutral , would be in the form of antineutrons which then decay into antiprotons , electrons and neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> . this fact may eventually be useful in the search for electroweak strings in our galaxy @xcite . </S>"
