    "most accreting stellar - mass black holes in binary systems exhibit large changes in luminosity over time , ranging from a substantial fraction of the eddington limit ( @xmath20 ) to @xmath21@xmath22 or @xmath21@xmath23@xmath20 .",
    "in addition to changes in luminosity , these systems show other observational changes , including transitions between distinct spectral states that are similar from system - to - system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal dominant ( or soft ) state has a strong thermal component from an optically thick accretion disk in the x - ray spectrum . in the hard state on the other hand",
    ", this component contributes a lower fraction of the flux in the x - ray band .",
    "the drop in flux is partly due to a decrease in the temperature of the component @xcite , moving its peak into the ultraviolet where it is difficult to measure due to interstellar absorption .",
    "while the soft thermal x - ray emission weakens , there is a strong increase in the hard x - rays , and the x - ray spectrum in the hard state is dominated by a power - law , which often has an exponential cutoff above 50100kev @xcite .",
    "accreting black holes also emit in the radio band when they are in the hard state , and this is due to a powerful compact jet @xcite . at radio frequencies ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a partially self - absorbed synchrotron component that has a flat or rising spectrum ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ) .",
    "the jet spectrum changes slope above the break frequency , @xmath26 , becoming steeper because the frequency is sufficiently high that the entire jet is optically thin . in some cases",
    ", the measurement of @xmath26 has been constrained to be in the infrared ( ir ) to optical @xcite , but its measurement can be complicated because of the other emission components ( e.g. , from the accretion disk or the optical companion ) and also because the jet spectrum is likely significantly more complicated than a simple broken power - law @xcite .    in the hard state , it is clear that there is a strong connection between the x - ray and radio emission .",
    "the fluxes in the two bands are correlated @xcite , and while early studies suggested that all black hole sources might lie on the same correlation line , observations of more systems have shown that this is not the case @xcite .",
    "a current topic of debate is whether all sources lie on two correlation lines , one track for standard sources and one for outliers , or if there is a continuum of different tracks @xcite .",
    "another topic is how much , if any , of the x - ray emission originates in the jet . while the most typical hard state spectrum with an exponential cutoff is well described by thermal comptonization , and it has been argued that it is unlikely that this emission is due to synchrotron emission from a jet @xcite , some black hole spectra appear to have multiple high - energy continuum components @xcite , and a jet origin is not ruled - out .",
    "in fact , cygnus  x-1 often shows two high - energy components in the hard state , including an mev component @xcite , and the detection of strong polarization at @xmath27400kev favors a synchrotron origin @xcite .",
    "the fact that a jet is present in the hard state and that there is some connection between the disk and the jet leads to the question of what we know about the disk properties .",
    "the main question regarding the optically thick disk concerns the location of the inner radius ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "one idea is that the black hole states are essentially determined by the mass accretion rate and @xmath28 @xcite , with sources entering the hard state because of an increase in @xmath28 .",
    "however , x - ray observations of sources in the bright hard state seem to contradict this since relativistically smeared reflection components are seen from some systems that imply that the disk remains close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , thermal component modeling has led to similar conclusions @xcite . while photon pile - up in ccd spectra has sparked some debate about iron line results @xcite , more recent observations with the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) _ confirm strongly broadened and skewed iron lines in the bright hard state for grs  1915 + 105 @xcite , grs  1739278 @xcite , gx  3394 @xcite , and cygnus  x-1 @xcite .",

    "@xmath2912@xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the gravitational constant , @xmath32 is the black hole mass , and @xmath33 is the speed of light .",
    "significantly truncated disks have been reported for the hard state at intermediate and low luminosities using reflection component modeling @xcite and also by modeling the thermal component from the optically thick disk @xcite .    to investigate questions related to the accretion geometry and the relationship between the disk and the jet",
    ", we performed multi - wavelength observations of the accreting black hole swift  j1753.50127 in the hard state .",
    "this system was first discovered in outburst in 2005 @xcite , and it is very unusual in that it has been bright in x - rays for almost a decade .",
    "the optical light curve shows a 3.2 hour modulation , which has been interpreted as a superhump period ( a modulation due to tidal stresses on a precessing , elliptical accretion disk ) , suggesting that the orbital period is somewhat smaller than this @xcite . from radial velocity measurements ,",
    "@xcite find a 2.85 hour signal , which is likely the true orbital period .",
    "thus , swift  j1753.50127 has one of the shortest orbital periods of any known black hole binary .",
    "although the mass of the black hole in swift  j1753.50127 is still debated since there has not been an opportunity to obtain a radial velocity measurement for the companion star with the system in quiescence , @xcite argue that the mass is relatively low , @xmath34 , and we adopt a black hole mass of 5  for calculations in this paper .",
    "swift  j1753.50127 is also unusual in that it has a low level of extinction , due in part to it being somewhat out of the plane with galactic coordinates of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite obtained uv measurements showing that @xmath37 , and we confirm this value in a companion paper ( rahoui et al . , submitted to apj ) .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether the system is relatively nearby or in the galactic halo as there is a large range of possible distances , @xmath3810kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide evidence that the uv emission from swift  j1753.50127 in the hard state comes from an accretion disk , and they calculate distance upper limits that depend on @xmath32 , assuming that the mass accretion rate is less than 5% @xmath20 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the upper limit is 2.83.7kpc , depending on the inclination of the system , and we use a fiducial distance of 3kpc for the calculations in this paper .",
    "swift  j1753.50127 has been extensively observed in the radio band , and is one of the clearest examples of a source that is an outlier in the radio / x - ray correlation plot @xcite .",
    "the location on the plot depends on the assumed distance , and the previous work has assumed a source distance of 8kpc . while we are adopting a significantly smaller distance , @xcite considered how distance affects the the radio underluminosity , which is a measure of",
    "how far a source is from the standard correlation .",
    "@xcite show that a smaller distance moves the source farther from the standard correlation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the fact that recent work suggests that swift  j1753.50127 is closer than early estimates only strengthens the conclusion that the source is an outlier .    for this work ,",

    "we edited out any data affected by antenna shadowing before hanning smoothing the data and removing any radio frequency interference . at all frequencies we used 3c286 to calibrate the instrumental frequency response , and to set the amplitude scale according to the default perley - butler 2010 coefficients implemented in the casa task setjy .",
    "we used j1743 - 0350 as a secondary calibrator to determine the time - varying complex gains arising from both atmospheric and instrumental effects .",
    "the calibrated data on swift  j1753.50127 were averaged by a factor of four in frequency to reduce the raw data volume , and then imaged using briggs weighting with a robust parameter of 1 to achieve the best compromise between sensitivity and sidelobe suppression .",

    "the jet can produce x - rays via post - shock synchrotron emission , which can be modeled as the broken power - law that we use in our fits , or synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) from the base of the jet , which can contribute in the hard x - ray band .",
    "the seds of gx  3394 , gro  j165540 , and xte  j1118 + 480 allow for the possibility that all the soft x - ray emission comes from the post - shock synchrotron component @xcite . for swift",
    "j1753.50127 , figure  [ fig : spectrum_all ] shows that such a scenario is ruled out , and a comptonization component is strongly required by the data .",
    "the question of what makes swift  j1753.50127 different is directly relevant to the question of what is different about the outliers in the x - ray / radio correlation .",
    "although one possibility is that swift  j1753.50127 has a stronger comptonization component in the x - rays , another possibility is that it has a weaker radio jet . in section 4.1",
    ", we showed that the highest possible peak flux for the swift  j1753.50127 broken power - law component is 2.18mjy .",
    "this corresponds to a specific ( peak ) luminosity of @xmath242@xmath187ergs@xmath1hz@xmath1 at @xmath243hz .",
    "@xcite give 15 peak luminosities for nine hard state black hole systems , and the values range from @xmath244 to @xmath245ergs@xmath1hz@xmath1 with a median value of @xmath246ergs@xmath1hz@xmath1 .",
    "thus , assuming a distance of 3kpc , the peak jet luminosity for swift  j1753.50127 is 50 times lower than the median and 3 times lower than the least luminous system .",
    "the distance to swift  j1753.50127 would need to be 56kpc to to move the swift  j1753.50127 peak jet luminosity close to the least luminous system , which is conceivable , but it would need to be @xmath4421kpc to make the swift  j1753.50127 comparable with the median peak jet luminosity , which can be ruled out .",
    "we made a second radio luminosity comparison by integrating the radio power - law measurements for swift  j1753.50127 and the black hole sources from @xcite up to @xmath26 .",
    "for swift  j1753.50127 , the luminosity up to @xmath173hz is @xmath247@xmath187ergs@xmath1 . for the sources from @xcite ,",
    "not all 15 of the seds are high enough quality to make a reliable luminosity determination .",
    "there was sufficient information to calculate ten luminosities for eight sources .",
    "these ranged from @xmath248ergs@xmath1 for xte  j1118 + 480 and @xmath249ergs@xmath1 for cyg  x-1 to @xmath250ergs@xmath1 for gs  135464 and @xmath251ergs@xmath1 for v404  cyg .",
    "the median value is @xmath252ergs@xmath1 , and the distance to swift  j1753.50127 is certainly not large enough for the luminosity to approach that value .",
    "thus , the low luminosity radio jet may be at least part of the reason why swift  j1753.50127 is an outlier .    while the swift  j1753.50127 sed is consistent with comptonization being dominant at soft x - rays ,",
    "our results show that multiple components are required to explain the entire 0.5240kev x - ray spectrum . in our spectral fits",
    ", we considered a reflection component or the post - shock synchrotron component .",
    "figure  [ fig : nir2x2 ] illustrates the reflection possibility , and such a scenario is consistent with our overall picture for the system .",
    "the outer optically thick disk could produce a weak ( @xmath162 ) reflection component , and it would be expected to have a low ionization , which is consistent with @xmath160ergcms@xmath1 . while an iron line detection would be strong evidence in favor of the reflection interpretation , there is no iron line in the swift  j1753.50127 spectrum , but we find that it is possible to explain the lack of an iron line with an iron abundance of @xmath161 of the solar value .",
    "this iron abundance may be problematic for the reflection interpretation , but we do not think that it is low enough to rule it out .",
    "we have also considered the fact that this is the only model that requires a very high comptonization temperature ( @xmath253kev ) .",
    "this occurs because the reflection component falls at high energies , allowing the overall model to fit the steeper _ suzaku_/gso spectrum without an exponential cutoff in the direct model .",
    "this electron temperature is higher than has been inferred from measurements of other accreting black holes in the higher luminosity parts of their hard states , which are typically in the 50120kev range ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is predicted that @xmath254 should increase to hundreds of kev in the lower luminosity parts of the hard state @xcite .",
    "thus , the lack of an iron line is the strongest reason to disfavor the reflection possibility , but this scenario is not ruled out .",
    "the model where the hard x - rays are due to post - shock synchrotron emission ( see figure  [ fig : nir2x1 ] ) has the advantage of a much more typical electron temperature ( @xmath255kev ) . on the other hand , the slope of the power - law , @xmath156 ( @xmath83 = @xmath256 ) , while not unreasonable for optically thin synchrotron emission , is harder than is seen for other black hole systems , which have values of @xmath83 between 0.68 and 1.38 @xcite .",
    "such a hard spectrum also requires that the spectrum is sharply cutoff to explain the steeper _ suzaku_/gso spectrum , and the exponential cutoff with @xmath257kev and @xmath258kev is probably inconsistent with the more gradual cutoff predicted for a synchrotron spectrum @xcite .",
    "a third possibility that was mentioned above but not specifically considered in our spectral modeling is that the extra hard x - ray component is due to ssc emission from the base of the jet .",
    "fits with the @xcite compact jet model are beyond the scope of this paper , but it would be interesting to use our sed to test this model in future work .    finally , we have considered whether any of our conclusions might be affected by day - to - day source variability given that the observations we use for the full sed cover @xmath212.8 days from the @xmath51-band observation to the vla observation ( although most of the measurements for the sed come from a smaller span of times ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc_zoom ] shows that there is little day - to - day variability in the optical and near - ir during the campaign , and this is consistent with previous long - term studies of swift  j1753.50127 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the _",
    "suzaku_/xis observations show day - to - day stability in the soft x - ray flux .",
    "it is a little less clear whether there are changes in the radio and ir compact jet spectrum as other black hole systems have shown significant changes in the break frequency on time scales of a day as discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "we already consider a large range of break frequencies ; thus , the conclusions that there is a separate thermal component in the near - ir to uv and that a comptonization component is required in the soft x - ray should not be affected .",
    "however , the question of whether the extra hard x - ray component comes from the compact jet depends very sensitively on the break frequency and spectral slope . to reach a definitive conclusion on the origin of the hard x - ray emission may require simultaneous radio and hard x - ray monitoring .",
    "we have obtained radio , near - ir , optical , uv , and x - ray coverage for the long - term black hole transient swift  j1753.50127 in 2014 april when the source was in the hard state at one of its lowest x - ray luminosities ( @xmath186  @xmath187ergs@xmath1 ) since the discovery of the source .",
    "we performed fitting of the broadband energy spectrum as well as the x - ray power spectrum .",
    "we obtain results concerning the compact jet , the optically thick accretion disk , and the origin of the x - ray emission , which is also relevant for the question of why swift  j1753.50127 is a radio / x - ray correlation outlier .    with the combination of the rising radio spectrum , and the rise in the near - ir ,",
    "@xmath26 is constrained for the post - shock synchrotron component of the compact jet , and this provides constraints on @xmath48 and @xmath131 for the jet acceleration zone . while the post - shock synchrotron component may contribute in hard x - rays , the soft x - ray flux is far too high to be part of this component , which we model with a comptonization component .",
    "based on this result , swift  j1753.50127 appears to be an outlier because of the combination of a strong comptonization component and a jet with peak and broadband luminosities significantly lower than is seen for other black hole systems .",
    "the low jet luminosity and the low extinction for swift  j1753.50127 appear to provide an opportunity to clearly see emission components that may be too weak or too absorbed to see in other systems .",
    "the double - peaked emission lines ( froning et al .",
    "2014 ; neustroev et al .",
    "2014 ; rahoui et al . ,",
    "submitted to apj ) clearly show that the near - ir to uv spectrum has at least a strong ( likely dominant ) thermal disk component .",
    "further evidence that the near - ir is dominated by thermal disk emission is that the component can be modeled by a disk with an outer radius of @xmath10@xmath7@xmath188 ( @xmath259@xmath7 cm ) , consistent with the expected size of the disk given previous measurements of the size of the companion s roche lobe .",
    "the fact that this component does not contribute in the x - ray band constrains the inner radius to be @xmath6@xmath7@xmath188 .",
    "while this implies that the near - ir to uv emission comes from a strongly truncated disk , there is also some evidence for a weak 150ev thermal component in the soft x - rays , and its inner radius could be as small as 514@xmath9 .",
    "the presence of two thermal components could provide support for predictions that low luminosity systems may have inner and outer optically thick disks with a gap in the middle .",
    "finally , we have considered the possibility that there is a reflection component in the spectrum . in the presence of strong hard x - rays ,",
    "one expects to see a reflection component from the optically thick material .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum is consistent with the presence of a reflection component , but no iron line is detected .",
    "the low ionization ( @xmath160erg@xmath113s@xmath1 ) and low covering fraction ( @xmath127 ) would favor the possibility that this component comes from the outer optically thick disk . if reflection is the cause of the second hard x - ray component , then invoking the jet to explain the extra hard x - ray emission ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum_all ] ) may not be required .",
