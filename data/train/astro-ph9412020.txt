    "anisotropy measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are a very effective tool for testing and constraining models of cosmic structure formation . with the discovery of large angular scale anisotropy by cobe ( smoot et al . , 1992 ) , there has been an increased interest in characterizing anisotropy on degree angular scales .",
    "although all cmb measurements have to overcome a long list of systematic effects and foreground contaminants ( wilkinson , 1994 ) , they have the potential to constrain many of the global parameters of the universe and thus discriminate among the plethora of cosmic structure formation models . over the past six years",
    ", we have travelled to the south pole three times to perform these degree scale anisotropy measurements .",
    "the results from our 1988 - 89 measurements are detailed in meinhold and lubin , 1991 ( sp89a ) and meinhold et al . , 1993 ( sp89b ) while the results from the 1990 - 91 measurements are detailed in gaier et al . , 1992 ( sp91a ) and schuster et al .",
    ", 1993 ( sp91b ) .",
    "the results from these measurements and the five balloon - borne millimeter - wave anisotropy experiment ( max ) are summarized in lubin , 1994 . in order to obtain additional data and frequency coverage , we returned to the amundsen - scott south pole station during the austral summer 1993 - 94 .",
    "the sp94 observations used the advanced cosmic microwave explorer ( acme ) as have all our previous degree scale anisotropy measurements .",
    "acme is a one meter off axis gregorian telescope which has been described in detail in sp89b . during the observations ,",
    "the ellipsoidal secondary oscillated sinusoidally at 8 hz with a peak to peak throw of 3@xmath0 on the sky .",
    "the receiver signals were phase synchronously demodulated using a `` square - wave '' lockin amplifier and sampled every 0.5 seconds .",
    "the beam profile of the telescope can be approximated as a gaussian beam with a 1 @xmath17 dispersion which varies in frequency as given below .",
    "two different total power radiometers were used in these observations . the lower frequency ( ka - band",
    ") receiver is similar to that described in sp91a and incorporates a very low noise , high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifier ( pospieszalski et al . ,",
    "1990 ) cooled to 4 k in a @xmath18he dewar .",
    "this receiver operated at four center frequencies ( 27.25 , 29.75 , 32.25 , and 34.75 ghz ) with 2.5 ghz 3 db bandwidths .",
    "the band subdivision is used to compensate for gain variations across the full band and to obtain spectral information which can be used to discriminate between the various astrophysical foregrounds . for the ka - band system ,",
    "the beam dispersion is given by @xmath19 the higher frequency receiver ( q - band ) is described in gundersen et al .",
    ", 1994 and also uses a cryogenic hemt amplifier based on a design developed at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "this amplifier was built at ucsb with assistance from nrao and uses an alinas / gainas / inp hemt ( pospieszalski et al .",
    ", 1994 ) in the first of five amplification stages .",
    "the q - band system was multiplexed into 3 equal bands centered at 39.15 , 41.45 , and 43.75 ghz with nominal 3 db bandwidths of 2.3 ghz , and the beam dispersion is given by @xmath20 the hemt amplifiers introduce intrinsic cross correlations between the bands which can be characterized by the correlation coefficient between any two frequencies .",
    "the measured correlations were typically 0.25 and 0.50 for the ka and q - band systems , respectively , including atmospheric correlations .",
    "the radiometers are calibrated to 10% absolute accuracy and 3% relative accuracy using a combination of cryogenic cold loads , the sky , ambient eccosorb , and the moon .",
    "the long term stability of the system was checked daily by inserting an ambient load `` calibrator '' .",
    "these calibrations varied by less than 3% over the time scale of an observation and contribute a negligible amount to the final error estimate .",
    "two observations were performed between january 9 , 1994 and january 22 , 1994 and collected 261 hours of data . the first observation used the q - band receiver and the second observation used the ka - band receiver .",
    "these observations consisted of smooth , constant declination , constant velocity scans of length 20@xmath0 on the sky about a center @xmath2145@xmath22 , @xmath23 - 62@xmath0 .",
    "the closest approach to the sun was 60@xmath0 on the sky and the closest approach to the plane of the galaxy corresponds to @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "this is a low foreground emission region which overlaps some of the region observed in sp91 .",
    "our measurement of the eta carina region showed that our absolute elevation was one degree lower than we expected .",
    "the offset has been attributed to sag in the inner frame of the telescope mount and makes a direct comparison between these measurements and the sp91 measurements problematic .",
    "the instantaneous right ascension of the beam for any of the 3 observations can be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 enumerates the scan number , @xmath28 is the sinusoidal chop amplitude , @xmath29 hz is the chop frequency , and @xmath30 mhz is the scan frequency .",
    "the instantaneous beam position on the sky is then given by @xmath31 .",
    "observations of the moon established the absolute pointing at low elevations and this was confirmed with observations of eta carina at high elevations .",
    "the error in absolute pointing is @xmath32 in right ascension and @xmath33 in declination while the error in relative pointing is @xmath34 in right ascension and @xmath34 in declination .",
    "if a temperature at position @xmath35 is compared to a temperature at position @xmath36 at the same declination , then the dimensionless window function can be written as @xmath37 ^2}4h_0 ^ 2[(\\ell-2r)\\alpha _",
    "o]j_0 ^ 2[(\\ell-2r)\\delta \\varphi /2]\\cos [ ( \\ell -2r)\\phi _ { ij}^{kl}]\\\\ ] ] where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the angular difference ( or lag ) between the temperature measured at bin @xmath40 with channel @xmath41 and the temperature measured at bin @xmath42 with channel @xmath43 .",
    "the beam profile function is given by @xmath44 , $ ] @xmath45 is the struve function of 0 index , @xmath46 is the 0@xmath47 order spherical bessel function and @xmath48 is the bin size in radians on the sky .",
    "the indices are given by @xmath49 to @xmath50 bins and @xmath51 to @xmath52 for the q - band data and @xmath51 to @xmath53 for the ka - band data .",
    "this window function is shown in figure 2 for the different combinations of beamsizes and is a specific example taken from a more general expression in white and srednicki ( 1994 ) .",
    "data were rejected for a number of reasons including poor pointing / chopper performance ( 1.2% ) , performance of other observations ( 0.2% ) , calibration sequences ( 0.7% ) , telescope / receiver maintenance ( 9.1% ) , temperature variations of the cold plate and backend electronics ( 0.9% ) , and bad weather ( 12.9% ) . from a total of 261 hours of data ,",
    "196 hours were used in the data analysis .",
    "the poor weather data were determined in a way similar to sp91b in which the data from a single scan were combined into position bins from which an average and one sigma error bar were calculated .",
    "the @xmath54 of the individual scans was then calculated , and if the probability of exceeding @xmath54 for 43 degrees of freedom was less than 0.01 for any channel , then the data from _ all _ channels for that scan were removed . as a cross check , other weather filters similar to sp91a",
    "were also implemented with no significant changes in the final data set . as with sp89 and sp91 ,",
    "an offset and gradient were removed in time over the time scale of a single scan ( 100 secs ) for each of the channels in an observation .",
    "the offsets were between 1 and 2 mk depending on the channel .",
    "the offset and gradient subtraction are taken into account in the analysis by creating a matrix @xmath55 such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the @xmath58 temperature means and @xmath59 are the @xmath60 projected temperatures with @xmath61 @xmath62 the formation of @xmath55 is discussed in bunn et al .",
    "1994 and we have made @xmath55 orthogonal such that @xmath63 .",
    "the coadded means and 1 sigma error bars are shown in figure 1 and show statistically significant , correlated signals for each observation .",
    "all quoted temperatures have been converted from antenna temperature to thermodynamic temperature and have been corrected for atmospheric absorption . in order to determine the origin of the observed structure , the data were binned in azimuthal and heliocentric coordinate systems .",
    "various subset analyses were performed including dividing the data set into four roughly equal quarters in time and dividing the data into four roughly equal quarters depending on the azimuthal position of the telescope beam .",
    "none of these analyses suggest that the observed structure is anything but celestial in origin .",
    "there are several astrophysical foregrounds which could contaminate these observations .",
    "these include diffuse synchrotron and free - free emission from within our own galaxy and extragalactic emission from discrete radio sources .",
    "neither the sunyaev - zeldovich effect nor diffuse 20 k dust emission is expected to contribute more than a few @xmath9k signal . if we assume that the 408 mhz map ( haslam et al . ) is a tracer of diffuse , high galactic latitude synchrotron emission , then we calculate the rms differential synchrotron emission to be 1.0 k at 408 mhz for these observations . given the spectral index for diffuse synchrotron is @xmath64 with an antenna temperature given by @xmath65 , we estimate that the diffuse synchrotron contribution to the observed rms to be @xmath66 @xmath9k in the lowest frequency channel and @xmath67 @xmath9k in the highest frequency channel . the small amount of differential emission that exists in this region of the sky at 408 mhz can be correlated with discrete radio sources which have been observed in other source surveys at 408 mhz and are identified in the pkscat90 database ( wright and otrupcek , 1990 ) . unlike diffuse synchrotron emission",
    ", discrete radio sources and free - free emission can not be dismissed on amplitude arguments alone . for diffuse free - free emission ,",
    "there are no all - sky surveys which would allow a direct estimate of the free - free contribution to the observed structure .",
    "instead , we have to rely on estimates based on a 10@xmath0 @xmath68 12@xmath0 h@xmath69 map ( reynolds , 1992 ) made at a similar angular scale to predict an average background free - free brightness temperature that can be expressed as t@xmath70 .",
    "reynolds data suggests that the variations in the h@xmath69 intensity may be a factor of 2 above the average , such that @xmath71t@xmath72t@xmath73 . from this",
    "we calculate the differential brightness temperature due to free - free emission ( upon the closest approach to the galactic plane ) to range from @xmath71t@xmath74 @xmath9k at the lowest frequency to @xmath71t@xmath75 @xmath9k at the highest frequency .",
    "there have been many discrete source surveys at lower frequencies which are compiled in the pkscat90 database .",
    "the parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey at 4.85 ghz ( wright et al . , 1994 ) serves as the most sensitive survey with a flux limit of 30 mjy in our observation region and includes all the sources identified in pkscat90 for our region .",
    "the sensitivity of the telescope is 90 @xmath9k / jy ( assuming 100% aperture efficiency ) , so a 30 mjy flat spectrum source ( with a flux density s(jy)@xmath76 @xmath77@xmath78 would produce a 3 @xmath9k signal , which is well below the noise of the observations . since the effective solid angle , @xmath79 , of the telescope varies like @xmath80 , a flat spectrum point source with a solid angle @xmath81 and @xmath82 would give @xmath83 , while a thermal point source produces an antenna temperature @xmath84 .",
    "if we make the worst case assumption that all the point sources have flat spectra to 45 ghz , then we estimate that they would produce a @xmath71t@xmath85 @xmath86k .",
    "since the worst case estimates of contamination from free - free emission and flat spectrum point sources are comparable to the rms level of the observed structure , we can not dismiss or verify these types of foreground contamination without measuring @xmath87 this is addressed in the following likelihood analysis .",
    "we use the bayesian method with a uniform prior ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ) in the determination of the root mean square ( rms ) amplitude of the data and to make an estimate of the broad - band power in the cmb power spectrum ( bond , 1994a , and steinhardt , 1994 ) .",
    "the experimental two point correlation function is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 for a spherical harmonic expansion of the radiation temperature given by @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the window function ( eq .",
    "1 ) and @xmath92 @xmath93 ( mather et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the rms amplitude is calculated from @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the average window function at zero lag .",
    "following bond , 1994a , the broad band power estimate is given by @xmath97 we consider a scale invariant , @xmath98 `` flat '' radiation power spectrum given by @xmath99 where the constant of proportionality and @xmath100 are determined in the likelihood analysis and @xmath101 is the center frequency of channel k normalized to the lowest center frequency of the observation(s ) .",
    "the full covariance matrix is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the data covariance matrix which is diagonal in each of the @xmath104 @xmath105 submatrices .",
    "this covariance matrix accounts for all spatial and channel - channel correlations as well as the error for each bin at each frequency . the offset and gradient subtraction are taken into account by creating a projected covariance matrix given by @xmath106 , where @xmath55 is defined in section 4 .",
    "the likelihood of the data set is proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 for @xmath60 degrees of freedom .",
    "table 1 lists the resulting rms and band power estimates for the individual observations as well as the combined observations .",
    "figure 2 shows the band power estimates with @xmath109 in relation to the cobe band power estimate .",
    "the q - band broad band power is consistent with standard cdm normalized to cobe and has a spectral index , @xmath100 , which is consistent with the cmb spectrum .",
    "the ka - band observation is also consistent with standard cdm normalized to cobe ; however , the spectral index does not rule out discrete radio sources and thus does not afford such a straightforward interpretation .",
    "when the ka and q - band data are combined , the broad band power is consistent with the standard cdm model normalized to cobe and the spectral index is consistent with the cmb spectrum . for the standard cdm power spectrum",
    ", the amplitude of the combined ka+q observations corresponds to a @xmath110 @xmath9k .",
    "the combined ka+q data show a marked improvement on the 1 @xmath6 confidence interval for the best fit @xmath111 for the most probable @xmath112 , spectra with @xmath113 ( such as diffuse synchrotron and free - free emission ) are formally excluded at the 5 @xmath6 level .",
    "the sp94 results are most easily compared to the sp91 results and the results of wollack et al . 1993 ( sk93 ) .",
    "a reanalysis ( bond , 1994b ) of the combined sp91a and sp91b observations gives @xmath114 which compares to the ka - band sp94 results of @xmath115 . the bond , sp91 analysis assumes that @xmath109 and that there is no channel to channel correlations .",
    "the sk93 result gives @xmath116 , for @xmath117 .",
    "the sk93 result is consistent with both the sp94 and the combined sp91 results , although one should note the differences between the experiments which are addressed in sk93 .",
