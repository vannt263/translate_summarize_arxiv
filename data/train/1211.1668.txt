    "galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) are mainly constituted by relativistic protons and are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks via first order fermi mechanism @xcite .",
    "though very popular , this scenario still needs to be conclusively proven by observations .",
    "if crs are indeed accelerated at snrs , these objects must be gamma  ray sources .",
    "this is because the crs accelerated at the shock undergo inelastic proton  proton interactions with the ambient medium and produce neutral pions which in turn decay into gamma rays @xcite .",
    "several snrs have been detected in gamma rays at both tev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) energies , in agreement with such expectations . however , it is often difficult to determine whether the origin of the gamma  ray emission is hadronic , and thus related to the acceleration of crs , or due to leptonic mechanisms such as inverse compton scattering . for this reason ,",
    "multi - wavelength studies of snrs have been extensively carried out in an attempt to solve this degeneracy .",
    "though for some individual snrs it has been possible to ascribe the gamma  ray emission exclusively and quite confidently to hadronic ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or leptonic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) processes , in other cases this ambiguity remains a problem .    an alternative way to reveal",
    "the presence of a cr source is by searching for the radiation produced by crs that escape the acceleration site @xcite . at some stage of the dynamical evolution of the snr",
    ", crs are expected to leave the shock region and escape into the interstellar medium .",
    "the details of the escape mechanism are still not very well understood ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but it is generally believed that the ability of a snr in confining particles decreases gradually with the shock speed , with higher energy particles leaving the shock earlier than low energy ones",
    ". once escaped , crs diffuse away from the snr and produce gamma ",
    "rays in interactions with the ambient gas . to date , some possible evidence for particle escape from snrs has been pushed forward by the observation of diffuse gamma ",
    "ray emission from the vicinity of the shell of the snrs w28 @xcite and w44 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the emission is clearly located outside of the shell and it is spatially coincident with the location of massive molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "this would favor a scenario in which the mcs are illuminated by the runaway crs and , being very massive , become prominent gamma ",
    "ray sources ( for the case of w28 see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion in section  [ sect : w28 ] ) .",
    "besides revealing the presence of a cr source , the gamma ",
    "ray emission from runaway crs can also be used to constrain the particles diffusion coefficient in the region surrounding the accelerator .",
    "this is very important for several reasons : first of all , a theoretical determination of the diffusion coefficient is a very complex task ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observational constraints are needed in order to guide and constrain models .",
    "in addition to that , the diffusion of crs is believed to be a non  linear process in which crs themselves generate via streaming instability the turbulence they scatter off ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant close to cr sources , where the cr density is expected to be very high , and possibly sufficient to suppress significantly the diffusion coefficient through streaming instability @xcite .",
    "thus , an empirical determination of the diffusion coefficient can reveal precious information on the ways in which particles and waves interact in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "most of the studies aimed at the determination of the cr diffusion coefficient from gamma ",
    "ray observations rely on the assumption of _ isotropic diffusion _ @xcite .",
    "the common rationale of these approaches can be summarized as follows : if snrs are the sources of crs , they have to convert a fraction @xmath0 of their explosion energy @xmath1 into accelerated particles . if the diffusion of crs proceeds isotropically , after a time @xmath2 from escape crs of a given energy @xmath3 are distributed roughly homogeneously within a distance @xmath4 from the snr . here , @xmath5 is the energy dependent diffusion coefficient of crs .",
    "gamma  ray observations of mcs located in the vicinity of w28 or w44 tells us which is the cr density @xmath6 needed to explain the observed emission .",
    "according to what said above , such density has to be of the order of @xmath7 , where the factor @xmath8 contains the information on the shape of the spectral energy distribution of escaping crs .",
    "for aged snrs such as w28 and w44 , the time @xmath2 after the escape can be identified with the snr age @xmath9 , and thus an expression for the diffusion coefficient can be obtained , and reads : @xmath10 .",
    "since the values of all the physical quantities present on the right side of the equation can be inferred from observations , the expression provides a direct estimate of the diffusion coefficient .    as an example , we summarize here the results obtained by @xcite in interpreting the gamma  ray emission observed from the mcs located close to the snr w28 . they obtained a good fit to the gamma ",
    "ray spetrum measured by h.e.s.s . at photon energies @xmath11  gev by assuming a diffusion coefficient for @xmath12  tev crs of the order of @xmath13  @xmath14/s .",
    "the corresponding diffusion length @xmath15 of these particles is of the order of 100 pc .",
    "also the broad band gamma ",
    "ray spectrum from gev to tev energies can be fitted by adjusting the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient and the distances between the snr and the clouds .",
    "the important point here is the fact that the estimated diffusion coefficient is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one normally adopted to describe the propagation of crs of energy @xmath16  tev in the galactic disk , which is @xmath17@xmath14/s @xcite .",
    "these results are very similar to the ones obtained by other authors by means of similar modeling @xcite and seem to point toward a drop of the diffusion close to the snr w28 .",
    "however , the validity of the assumption of isotropic diffusion of crs needs to be discussed .",
    "in fact , if the intensity of the turbulent field @xmath18 on scales resonant with the larmor radius of particles is significantly smaller than the mean large scale field @xmath19 ( i.e. if @xmath20 ) , then _",
    "cr diffusion becomes anisotropic _ , with particles diffusing preferentially along the magnetic field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the limiting",
    "( but still reasonable ) case in which the perpendicular diffusion coefficient can be set equal to zero , the transport of crs across the mean field is mainly due to the wandering of magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "this is the situation that we investigate in this paper .    to give a qualitative idea of the role that anisotropic diffusion can play in these study ,",
    "let us consider an idealized case in which particles that escape a snr diffuse along a magnetic flux tube characterized by a very long coherence length ( i.e. the magnetic flux tube is preserved for a long distance ) . in this case",
    ", after a time @xmath2 particle will diffuse up to a distance @xmath21 along the tube ( here @xmath22 is the _",
    "parallel _ diffusion coefficient ) , while their transverse distribution will be equal to the radius of the snr shock at the time of their escape , @xmath23 , which is of the order of @xmath24  110 pc .",
    "thus , the enhanced cr density in the flux tube will be proportional to @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 as in the isotropic case .",
    "it is easy to see that the estimates of the diffusion coefficient based on the two opposite assumptions of isotropic and one - dimensional diffusion will differ by a factor of @xmath27 , which can be much larger than an order of magnitude !",
    "thus , it is of paramount importance to investigate how the interpretation of gamma ",
    "ray observations depends on the assumptions made concerning cr diffusion .    in section",
    "[ sect : model ] we develop a model for cr propagation in which crs are strongly magnetized and diffuse uniquely along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the wandering of the field lines is also taken into account , and a diffusion coefficient @xmath28 for the magnetic field lines that depends on the properties of the turbulent field is defined ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in section  [ sect : results ] the model is used to predict the spatial distribution of runaway crs and their spectrum .",
    "finally , we apply the model to the case of the snr w28 in section  [ sect : w28 ] . a good fit to data",
    "is obtained , and the estimate of the parallel diffusion coefficient is found to depend on the level of anisotropy of the diffusion . for higher level of anisotropy , i.e. smaller values of @xmath28 , larger values of the particles diffusion coefficient are needed in order to fit data .",
    "a discussion of the results and of future perspectives in this line of research can be found in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "consider a magnetic flux tube whose mean magnetic field @xmath19 is assumed to lie along the @xmath29-axis , perpendicular to the @xmath30 plane .",
    "the wandering of magnetic field lines is due to long wavelength perturbations , i.e. perturbations on scales much larger than the particles gyroradii , with root mean square amplitude @xmath18 .",

    ", the coherence lengths can be expressed as @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the characteristic wave ",
    "vectors of the perturbation @xcite . under these circumstances ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to define the lyapunov length @xmath41 which describes the exponential separation of field lines whose initial separation is smaller than @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the length above which the flux tube is disrupted by field line divergence . for fiducial values of the parameters",
    "the length of the flux tube is of the order of a few hundred parsecs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are interested here in studying the propagation of crs in the presence of magnetic field line wandering .",
    "energetic particles diffuse along and across the magnetic field line as the result of resonant interactions with magnetic field perturbations .",
    "such perturbations are characterized by length scales of the order of the particles larmor radii .",
    "such scales are much smaller than the ones responsible for field line wandering . according to quasi ",
    "linear theory , the ratio between the parallel to perpendicular diffusion coefficient is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the particle s mean free path along the field line and @xmath44 is its gyroradius . in the interstellar medium it is believed that @xmath45 which implies @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , in the following we will neglect the diffusion of particles perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "in other words , a given particle remains attached to the same field line . under this conditions , in a time interval @xmath47 a particle diffuses along a given field line a distance @xmath48 , but over such a distance @xmath49 along the @xmath29axis the field line is displaced by an amount @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to @xcite : @xmath51 which describes a sub  diffusive transport of particles perpendicular to the mean magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "this behavior of energetic particles due to the combination of the particle diffusion along the field lines and the random walk of the field lines themselves has been often referred to as _ compound diffusion _ , or _",
    "anomalous diffusion_. models of compound diffusion have been developed and used in a great variety of contexts , to study phenomena like the heat transport in tokamak @xcite , the propagation of energetic particles in the solar wind @xcite , the confinement of crs in the galaxy @xcite and their acceleration at astrophysical shocks @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply the formalism of compound diffusion to another context , which is the propagation of crs in the vicinity of their sources , i.e. snrs , after they escape the acceleration region .",
    "we will show that in this situation an accurate modeling is needed in order to interpret in a correct way the gamma  ray observations of mcs located in the vicinity of snrs .    in order to describe the compound diffusion of crs we adopt the mathematical formalism developed by @xcite and we define @xmath52 as the probability to find a field line displaced by an amount @xmath53 after a step of length @xmath29 along the direction of the umperturbed field @xmath19 .",

    "a similar equation holds for the displacement @xmath55 .",
    "this has to be combined with the probability @xmath56 that a particle moves a distance @xmath29 along the field line in a time @xmath57 . for diffusive transport of particles along the field",

    "are expected to escape the remnant at different times , the radius of the injection region is an energy dependent quantity .",
    "following @xcite we assume a power law scaling to connect the particle energy of the runaway crs with the time after the supernova explosion : @xmath67 where the implicit assumption has been made that the maximum energy of crs accelerated in a snr @xmath68 is reached at the time @xmath69 which marks the transition between the free expansion and the sedov phases of the snr evolution , and that crs are gradually released in the interstellar medium from that time on .",

    "we notice that , for @xmath85 , eq .  [ eq : frw ] does not provide a good description of the field line wandering .",
    "the reason is that in this regime the lateral displacement of a field line after a step @xmath29 along @xmath19 is of the order of @xmath86 , since @xmath87 represents the angle between the unperturbed ( @xmath19 ) and total ( @xmath88 ) magnetic field @xcite .",

    "sect : model ] to estimate the spectrum of crs and derive the @xmath167-ray emission expected from the clouds in the w28 region .",
    "this approach is radically different from the ones mentioned above because it relies on the more physical assumption that the diffusion of crs is not isotropic , but proceeds mainly along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the results of our modeling are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w28 ] , where the gamma  ray data from the three molecular clouds are plotted as blue open symbols ( data from fermi ) and black filled dots ( data from hess ) .",
    "the emission from the sources hess j1801 - 233 , and hess j1800 - 240 a and b is plotted in the top , middle , and bottom panel , respectively .",
    "the black dashed lines represent the contribution to the gamma ",
    "ray emission from the proton  proton interactions of the crs in the galactic background with the inter  cloud gas .",
    "the blue long  dashed lines represents the contribution to the emission from the runaway crs that escaped from w28 .",
    "the solid red line is the total emission .",
    "the gamma ",
    "ray fluxes have been computed following @xcite with an additional multiplicative factor 1.5 to take into account elements heavier than hydrogen in both cosmic rays and ambient gas @xcite .",
    "a good agreement with observations is obtained is a parallel diffusion coefficient @xmath108@xmath14/s with @xmath109 is adopted , together with a diffusion coefficient for field lines @xmath113pc with @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , we assumed that @xmath168 of the total explosion energy has been converted into crs with a spectrum proportional to @xmath169 and extending from @xmath116gev to @xmath170pev . in order to be illuminated by the escaping crs , the three molecular clouds have to be located in the proximity of the axis of the magnetic flux tube ( i.e. the direction of the local mean field ) .",
    "the spectra reported in the figure refers to the positions @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173pc and @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176pc ( top to bottom panel , respectively ) .",
    "it has to be noted that , due to the number of parameters involved in the model , other sets of parameter values might be found that provide an equally satisfactory fit to data .",
    "this is not surprising , given that several previous modelings of this source provided an equally good fit to data by using a radically different picture ( i.e. isotropic diffusion of crs ) for the transport of particles .",
    "moreover , while a quite small normalization of the ( isotropic ) diffusion coefficient , roughly of the order of @xmath177  @xmath14/s had to be adopted in order to fit data satisfactorily , in the anisotropic case we obtain a good agreement with data for a significantly larger value of the ( parallel ) diffusion coefficient of @xmath178  @xmath14/s .",
    "it might be noticed that this number is close to the standard values inferred for the diffusion of crs in the galaxy .",
    "thus , any attempt to constrain the cr diffusion coefficient from the observations of gamma ",
    "rays from the vicinity of snrs needs to take into account that an intrinsic uncertainty exists , and it is related to the unknown nature of the cr transport in the interstellar medium , and in particular to the unknown relative relevance of the transport parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the details of the transport of crs in the galaxy are still little understood . studies of the composition of crs provide us with an estimate of the average confinement time of crs within the galaxy , which can be translated into a spatially averaged diffusion coefficient for crs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether the cr diffusion coefficient has large spatial variations or it is rather uniform throughout the galaxy is not known , thought a suppression of diffusion close to cr sources might be expected due to cr streaming instability @xcite . to this purpose ,",
    "the detection of gamma  ray emission from the vicinity of cr accelerators might be used to constrain the cr diffusion coefficient , and thus assess the importance of such suppression ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because crs escaping the accelerators would produce gamma rays via proton  proton interactions with the ambient medium .",
    "both the morphology of the resulting emission and its spectrum would depend on the functional form ( i.e. energy dependence , level of anisotropy ) of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "an object that has been extensively investigated in this context is the snr w28 .",
    "three massive molecular clouds , with total mass in the @xmath179 range , are located in the vicinity of the snr shell and emit gamma rays .",
    "this has been interpreted as the result of the illumination of the clouds by the crs that escaped the snr .",
    "several models have been proposed to fit these observations , and all of them are based on the assumption that the diffusion of crs proceeds isotropically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and see sec .  [",
    "sect : w28 ] for a complete list of references ) .",
    "there is a general consensus on the fact that the ( isotropic ) diffusion coefficient has to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath180 with respect to the average galactic one in order to explain the observations .",
    "this implies coefficients in the range @xmath181@xmath14/s .    in this paper",
    ", the assumption of isotropy of diffusion has been relaxed , and a more physically motivated situation have been investigated , in which crs propagate mainly along the magnetic field lines .",
    "we considered here the limiting scenario in which the diffusion of crs across field lines is very small and thus can be neglected .",
    "in such a situation , the transverse displacement of crs is uniquely due to the wandering of the field lines @xcite .",
    "spectra and morphology of the spatial distribution of crs around snrs have been computed and described .",
    "the main feature is the elongated , filamentary distribution of crs , as opposed to the spherical distribution found in the case of isotropic diffusion .    in order to fit the gamma ",
    "ray data from the w28 region within this scenario , one has to assume that the molecular clouds in its vicinity are magnetically connected to the snr through a magnetic field flux tube . if this is the case , an accurate fit to data can be obtained . under this assumption ,",
    "particles are bound to the flux tube and thus forced to propagate along a specific direction . for plausible values of the diffusion coefficient of magnetic field lines , in order to obtain the correct cr over  density at the location of the molecular clouds a large ( parallel ) diffusion coefficient of the order of @xmath182@xmath14/s has to be adopted .",
    "the fact that a very good agreement has been found with data in the two radically different scenarios characterized by isotropic and anisotropic diffusion tells us that more data needs to be collected from more snrs in order to infer with reasonable confidence the properties of the diffusion of particles escaping their accelerators .",
    "the diffuse emission that these runaway particles would produce in their interaction with the ambient gas is , even in the absence of very massive clouds , within the capabilities of the cherenkov telescope array @xcite .",
    "these observations will provide us with precious informations about the properties of the transport of crs in the galaxy , but also with a direct evidence for the fact that snrs are indeed the accelerators of galactic crs .",
