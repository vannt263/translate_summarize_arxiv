    "soon after the discovery of the @xmath0he superfluids in 1972 it was understood that they represented the first example of unconventional cooper pairing among fermi systems , a p - wave state with total spin @xmath1 and orbital momentum @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this lead to a wide variety of new phenomena , of which one of the most important is the discovery of new vortex structures @xcite .",

    "examples of _ continuous _ vortices are the doubly quantized vortex in @xmath0he - a and the vortex in a two - component bose - einstein condensate , which has a wide inflated core .",

    "recent advances in optical trapping and cooling of alkali atom clouds to bose - einstein condensates have produced bose systems which also are described by a multi - component order parameter : the spinor representation of the hyperfine spin manifold @xmath8 , for instance , would allow the presence of similar vorticity as in @xmath0he - a .",
    "thus the existence of unconventional vorticity has moved in the centre of interdisciplinary debate : to what extent will reduced symmetry influence the structure of quantized vorticity ?",
    "vortex lines are defects of the order parameter field , which carry phase winding and circulation of the respective supercurrent .",
    "the conventional structure is built around a narrow _ singular hard vortex core _ :",

    "such a core can be pictured to be a tube with a diameter comparable to the coherence length and filled with normal - state material .",

    "( b ) at high enough magnetic field , the singly quantized vortices in @xmath0he - b have composite cores . here",
    "the vorticity is concentrated in the hard core , while the soft core supports an inhomogeneous order - parameter distribution where the spin - orbit interaction is not minimized .",

    "this core is embedded within a planar domain - wall - like soliton defect where the spin - orbit interaction is not minimized and which supports a spin current .",
    "the distinction between non - singular and continuous vortices , and also the existence of a vortex with a composite core rely upon the presence of two length scales , which in turn are determined by two energy scales . in superfluid @xmath0he the two relevant energy scales are the weak spin - orbit interaction and the two orders of magnitude larger superfluid condensation energy .",
    "these fix the soft and the hard core sizes , respectively , and as a result the soft core is typically two orders of magnitude larger in diameter than the hard core . if the two scales become comparable in magnitude ( as typically occurs in superconductors ) , then the difference between the continuous and non - singular vortices is washed out .    an understanding of the various structures , in which quantized vorticity may appear , has led to new insight in the physics of macroscopic quantum systems",

    ". therefore fermion superfluids and superconductors on one hand and quantum field theory on the other hand show surprising conceptual similarity .",
    "this makes it possible to treat the condensed - matter quantum systems as laboratory models to study physical principles which might also be effective in high energy physics or cosmology .",
    "the first examples of such work have been seen in  cosmological \" laboratory experiments .",
    "for instance , it was recently demonstrated that quantized vortex lines , or linear topological defects as they are known in field theory , are produced in quench - cooled transitions from the normal to the superfluid / superconducting state @xcite .",
    "this process has been suggested to mimic the production of cosmic strings in big - bang expansion .",
    "a second effort was related to the dynamics of vortex lines and was exploited to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the early universe @xcite , if it is assumed to result from the axial anomaly of relativistic field theory .",
    "relativistic quantum field theory may just have found itself an unexpected accomplice !",
    "superfluid @xmath0he has been blessed with the most ideal properties among the dense coherent quantum systems , approaching those of the alkali atom clouds in bose - einstein condensed states : ( i ) there are no bulk impurities since all alien particles are expelled to the container walls .",

    "one of the most striking results emerging from @xmath0he research is the existence of vortices with perfectly continuous singularity - free structure .",
    "in such a vortex the order - parameter amplitude remains constant throughout the whole structure while its orientation changes in a continuous manner . in the @xmath0he - a phase with axial anisotropy ( and cooper pairs in @xmath21 states ) , the orbital order - parameter orientation is denoted by the symmetry axis @xmath22 which points in the direction of the nodes of the superfluid energy gap . at very low magnetic fields vorticity",

    "skyrmions and merons are popular structures in physics : for instance , the double - quantum vortex , in the form of a pair of merons similar to that in @xmath0he - a , is also discussed in the quantum hall effect where it is formed by pseudo - spin orientations in the magnetic structure @xcite . in qcd merons",

    "from the topological point of view , all vortices with the same winding number @xmath38 can be transformed to each other without changing the asymptotic behaviour of the order parameter , simply by reconstruction of the vortex core . to obtain the continuous vortex in @xmath0he - a ( fig .",
    "[ softvorcore ] ) we can start with a @xmath35 _ singular phase vortex _",
    ", which has a hard core of the size of the coherence length and a uniformly oriented orbital momentum axis @xmath22 along @xmath39 .",
    "this is a pure phase vortex for the orbital component @xmath40 of the order parameter , which vanishes only on the vortex axis while other components are zero everywhere .",
    "if we now allow for the presence of the other components @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then we might fill the hard core with these components , such that the core becomes non - singular . the non - singular core can expand further to form a continuous soft core , which is much larger in radius than the coherence length .",
    "its size is limited by some other weaker energy scales , for instance in @xmath0he - a by the tiny spin - orbit interaction . within the core @xmath22 sweeps through all possible orientations and the topology becomes that of a skyrmion .",
    "this transformation between continuous and singular vorticity has direct application to bose - einstein condensates .",
    "suppose a mixture of two sub states can be rotated in a laser manipulated trap .",
    "here one starts with a single bose - condensate which we denote as the @xmath43 component . within this component a pure @xmath44 phase vortex with singular core",
    "is created .",
    "next the hard core of the vortex is filled with the second component in the @xmath45 state . as a result",
    "the core expands and a vortex with continuous structure is obtained .",
    "such a skyrmion has recently been observed with @xmath46rb atoms @xcite .",
    "it can be represented in terms of the @xmath22 vector which is constructed from the components of the order parameter as @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the cylindrical coordinates with the axis @xmath50 along the vortex axis .",
    "the polar angle @xmath51 of the @xmath22 vector changes from 0 at infinity , where @xmath52 and only the @xmath43 component is present , to @xmath53 at the axis , where @xmath54 and only the @xmath45 component is present ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "various schemes have recently been discussed by which a meron with phase winding can be created in a bose - condensate formed within a three - component @xmath8 manifold @xcite .",
    "the singly quantized vortex in @xmath0he - a has a composite core : it is a @xmath44 vortex with a non - singular hard core , but where the superfluid circulation is generated by the soft core .",
    "thus this @xmath44 vortex is not a simple @xmath55 phase vortex , which would have circulation trapped around a hard core in an otherwise homogeneous @xmath22 texture .",
    "in fact , the function of the hard core is only to provide the topological stability of the soft core , which with its @xmath34 orientational distribution of the @xmath22 field produces all the vorticity .",

    "in contrast , if one starts to rotate the fluid when it is already in the superfluid state below @xmath58 , then the @xmath44 vortex is generally not formed , because the @xmath35 vortex has lower critical velocity and is created first .",

    "the equilibrium state of the vortex sheet in a rotating vessel is constructed by considering the kinetic energy from the flow between the folds and the surface tension @xmath63 from the soliton sheet .",
