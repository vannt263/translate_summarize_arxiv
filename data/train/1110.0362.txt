    "coronal dimmings are regions in the solar corona that undergo an abrupt intensity drop roughly co - temporal with the launch of a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) .",
    "they are observable in soft x - rays ( sxr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and most conspicuously in the extreme uv ( euv ; _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) both on the solar disk and above the limb .",
    "global - scale dimmings originate from the source region of the eruption and may expand across almost the entire solar disk ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they follow the nearly spherically propagating fronts of global coronal waves ( moreton waves and eit waves , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , small - scale twin dimmings , which typically exhibit a more dramatic intensity decrease , occur in confined areas near the ends of a pre - flare , s - shaped sigmoid structure @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted physical interpretation of coronal dimmings is that they reflect the strong density depletion of the inner corona due to the expansion or ` opening ' of magnetic field lines in the wake of a cme .",
    "two major lines of evidence support this view : ( 1 ) measurements of doppler shifts in emission lines formed in the lower transition region and corona revealed material outflows co - spatial with small - scale dimming regions , with outflow velocities of several tens of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "inside global - scale dimmings mass outflows with velocities of @xmath1 were found @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) based on the idea that due to mass conservation the mass accumulated in the leading edge of the cme has to be balanced by the density depletion in the dimming region , coronal dimmings have been used to estimate cme masses ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases",
    ", the consistency with cme masses based on white - light measurements was good ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in other cases , the cme mass based on euv observations was 3070% smaller than the white - light estimate ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite attributed this discrepancy partly to transition region outflows , which refill the dimming regions .",
    "nevertheless , these studies strengthen the link between coronal dimmings and cmes .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the dimming process is considered as a powerful diagnostic of the early phase of a cme , especially with regard to the physics of cme onsets @xcite .",
    "this phase can not be examined using white - light observations , since the occulting disk of the coronagraph obscures both the sun and the lower layers of the corona , where the cme is usually launched and accelerated @xcite .",
    "previous studies on coronal euv dimmings addressed their temporal and spatial relationship to the associated cme , the amount of the euv intensity drop as well as the timescale and duration of the dimmings ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite examined both the temporal evolution of the size of particular dimming areas and the apparent motion of these regions . due to observational limitations ,",
    "however , in all of these studies a particular dimming event was observed either on the solar disk or above the limb , depending on the particular line of sight from the observing instrument to the source region of the eruption .",
    "therefore , it was impossible to examine in one and the same event the temporal evolution of coronal dimmings from different vantage points .    with the launch of the twin stereo spacecraft ( _ solar - terrestrial relations observatory _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) these observational limitations are temporarily over , and more importantly , the sun was cooperative enough to produce a cme / flare event when stereo ahead ( sta ) and stereo behind ( stb ) were in quadrature on 13 february 2009 .",
    "the resulting unprecedented data set allows us to investigate the coronal euv dimming process in this event simultaneously both on the solar disk and above the limb . due to the line - of - sight integration of the optically thin emission ,",
    "the combination of on - disk and above - the - limb observations is particularly instructive .",
    "we compare both dimming observations and relate them to the kinematics of the associated cme .",
    "finally , we combine euv observations obtained from both the stereo and the _ hinode _ spacecraft @xcite to examine the relationship between dimming locations and mass flows .    in section  [ sec : dobs ] we describe the observations as well as the data sets used and the data reduction procedures applied .",
    "the analysis and results are presented in sections  [ sec : analysis ] and [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "the 13 february 2009 cme / flare event occurred in noaa active region ar 11012 . at this time , the separation angle of the two stereo spacecraft was @xmath2 .",
    "sta observed the event above the solar limb , while stb observed it near the center of the solar disk .",
    "the cme had a typical three - part structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , a bright front , a dark cavity , and a bright core .",
    "the flare ( goes class b2.4 ) started around 05:30  ut ( goes maximum at 05:47 ut ) .",
    "the event was associated with a global coronal wave observed in euv @xcite .",
    "although in this paper we focus on the investigation of the early phase of the cme , it is interesting to note that the heliospheric imagers ( hi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard sta tracked the cme s leading edge up to the distance of about 1  au .",
    "in addition , the stb / impact @xcite and plastic @xcite instruments registered a weak shock on 18 february 2009 , 10:00  ut , followed by the complex magnetic field and bulk plasma signatures typically associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection ( icme ) .",
    "a possible encounter of the icme with venus was observed with the venus express magnetometer @xcite .",
    "a detailed study on the icme using the sta / hi observations along with the in situ measurements provided by stb and the venus express is underway and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .      from the sta and stb spacecraft we use euv 171 and 195   filtergrams , provided by the extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to investigate the dimming process both on the solar disk and above the limb .",
    "in addition , we use the sta / euvi 171   filter in combination with sta / cor1 white - light images to track the cme front , and thus , determine its velocity and acceleration profile .",
    "the observing cadence in the euvi 171   filter is 2.5  min for sta and 5  min for stb , while in the 195   filter it is 10  min for both stereo spacecraft .",
    "the white - light sta image cadence is 10  min for cor1 and 15  min for cor2 .",
    "the secchi_prep routine in the solarsoft software package ( ssw ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to reduce the images .",
    "all images were rescaled to earth distance to compare observations from sta and stb .",
    "stb / euvi filtergrams were differentially rotated to the same reference time .",
    "in addition , the gamma - log function , a compound of the logarithmic and gamma functions , was applied to the stb / euvi filtergrams to enhance faint structures in the images while retaining detail in the bright features .      to derive plasma flow velocities in the active region we use the earliest available euv raster scan for this event , provided by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the _ hinode _ spacecraft .",
    "the scan covers the period immediately after the decay phase of the cme - associated flare ( 07:25    08:12  ut ) .",
    "the eis instrument provides high - resolution euv spectra within two wavebands : 166    211   and 246    292   , covering emission lines in the transition region and corona .",
    "four slit / slot positions ( 1@xmath3 , 2@xmath3 , 40@xmath3 , and 266@xmath3 ) allow a wide choice of operation modes .",
    "eis raster scans are carried out in the following way . in each emission line",
    "the intensity is measured by sampling the line across the 1@xmath3 or 2@xmath3 width of the slit .",
    "this sampling is carried out at up to 512  positions across the length of the slit .",
    "after this , the slit is moved to the next position of the region of interest until the entire region is scanned .",
    "observations can be carried out in up to 25  lines simultaneously .",
    "images in a particular emission line are constructed as follows . to obtain a pixel column of the image , at each position across the length of the slit , the intensity is integrated over the spectral line width . repeating this procedure for all slit positions within the region of interest yields the entire image .    after the decay phase of the b2.4 flare , the eis instrument scanned the active region from west to east in 90 steps , each step 2@xmath3 wide , with a slit length of 320@xmath3 , yielding a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath4 .",
    "the observations comprise eight spectral windows , each 32 pixels wide ( _ i.e. _ , the intensity in each line was sampled at 32 positions across the line ) .",
    "we use the fe  xii  195.12   window .",
    "we calibrated the eis data using the idl routine eis_prep , available in the eis part of the solarsoft tree .",
    "this routine corrects for flat field , dark current , and cosmic rays , and flags saturated , hot , and warm pixels .",
    "after this , we derived a dopplergram from the fe  xii  195.12   intensity image as follows . using the routine eis_auto_fit , we fitted a single gaussian to the calibrated eis data to compute a velocity array from the measured line centroid positions .",
    "we then corrected the obtained velocity and centroid vectors for the tilt of the eis slit ( eis_tilt_correction ) and the orbital variation of the line centroid ( eis_orbit_spline ) .",
    "as aforementioned , eis images , derived from raster scans , are not snapshots taken at a particular moment in time .",
    "when we look at such an image we look at stringed - together pixel columns taken at different instants in time . therefore ,",
    "if the scanned region is a flaring region , the features in the fov may have changed dramatically during the scan .",
    "accordingly , the co - alignment of eis images and euvi filtergrams is a tricky issue .",
    "even though there will be similar features in eis and euvi images taken in the same passband , the images will not look exactly the same . to solve the problem of co - alignment , we used a method similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "we compared eis and euvi images at 195   .",
    "we set the mid - time of the raster scan as the time of the eis image , chose an euvi image observed closest to this time , visually compared it with the eis image by identifying similar features , and then shifted the values of xcen and ycen in the euvi image to roughly co - align it with the eis raster image .",
    "after this , we cross - correlated both images to refine the visual co - alignment .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of the co - alignment achieved with this method to @xmath53@xmath3 .",
    "stereo / euvi  171 and 195   filtergrams reflect the emitting state of the coronal plasma at approx .  1 and 1.5  mk , respectively @xcite .",
    "to investigate the coronal dimming process , we calculate intensity light curves from these filtergrams by ( 1 ) summing up at each time all pixel intensities within a region of interest ( roi ) and ( 2 ) dividing this sum by the number of pixels in this region . for",
    "a _ global light curve _ the roi is a large rectangular box surrounding the dimming regions , for a _ local light curve _ the roi is determined as follows . to enhance the contrast of the dimming regions we use base difference images , _",
    "i.e. _ , we subtract a pre - event image taken around 13-feb-2009 04:45  ut from all successive frames .",
    "we then count among the dim pixels all pixels with intensities in the range [ @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is always negative , and is the intensity of the darkest pixel in a difference image and @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "for instance , for @xmath9 ( in units of normalized detected photons ) and a factor of @xmath10 , pixels with intensities in the range [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 are counted among the dim pixels ( _ i.e. _ , an @xmath13%-threshold is used ) .",
    "hence , the number of pixels forming the roi of a local light curve varies in time .",
    "this offers the opportunity to track the size evolution of local dimmings as well .",
    "we normalize all light curves to the pre - event intensity level .",
    "the drop in the euv intensity @xmath14 during coronal dimmings is usually interpreted as mass loss in the corona in the wake of a cme .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the euv intensity variation in coronal dimming regions reflects the variation of the mass density .",
    "therefore , we consider the intensity change rate @xmath15 as a proxy for the mass loss rate , _",
    "i.e. _ , the time evolution of the mass loss .",
    "we calculate @xmath15 as the time derivative of a spline fit to the normalized dimming light curve .",
    "we derive the temporal evolution of the cme velocity and acceleration ( _ i.e. _ , the profiles @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) as follows .",
    "we ( 1 ) construct running difference images from sta / euvi 171   and cor1 white light frames to enhance the contrast of the cme front , ( 2 ) track the fastest - moving part of the front , ( 3 ) fit the obtained height - time measurements by a spline fit , and ( 4 ) calculate the first and second time derivative of the fit curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution ] shows the source region of the cme observed with stb / euvi  171   .",
    "the cme - associated flare occurs at the site of an s - shaped sigmoid structure ( figure  [ fig : evolution](a ) ) . during the impulsive phase of the flare , two elongated , roughly north - south aligned flare ribbons separate ( figure  [ fig : evolution](b ) ) .",
    "the first postflare loops , resulting from the reconnection of magnetic field lines , appear at the beginning of the decay phase ( figure  [ fig : evolution](c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , two small - scale dimming regions , designated as dr1 and dr2 , appear near the ends of the pre - flare sigmoid .",
    "these regions grow and exhibit an apparent motion during the decay phase ( figure  [ fig : evolution](d ) ) .",
    "the postflare loops in between the dimmings form an east - west aligned arcade .    in the top row of figure",
    "[ fig : dimming_duration ] we plot the stb / euvi 195   intensity light curve calculated from the fov of the images presented in the middle row ( global light curve ) . at the beginning of the presented time interval we use the full image cadence available ( 10  min ) to capture the abrupt intensity drop .",
    "after 13-feb-2009 08:25  ut the cadence is reduced to 40  min , as a lower cadence is sufficient to capture the subsequent gradual changes in the euv intensity .",
    "the intensity drops down to roughly 83% of the pre - flare euv level in approx",
    ".  30  min .",
    "the recovery of the euv intensity back to the pre - event level in the event under study takes approx .",
    "16  h. we note that in extreme cases , recovery times of coronal dimmings up to 48  h have been observed @xcite .",
    "the middle and bottom rows show four representative euvi 195   direct and base difference images , respectively , illustrating the onset of the dimmings and the ensuing gradual intensity increase , as the rarefied regions are slowly refilled .",
    "we use the stb / euvi  195   filtergrams to track the apparent motion of the localized dimming regions dr1 and dr2 ( _ cf . _  figure  [ fig : evolution ] , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) and to investigate the evolution of their size .",
    "we determine the pixel size of dr1 and dr2 in each base difference image , using a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "this @xmath13%-threshold proved to be most suitable for tracing the dim areas in an image .",
    "after this , we calculate the ` center of gravity ' ( cog ) of dr1 and dr2 at each time ( _ i.e. _ , for each frame we weight the location of dim pixels by their intensity , and then we divide the sum of these products by the number of dim pixels ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cog_image ] shows the locations of the cogs for both dimming regions at each time superimposed on a base difference image , taken during the decay phase of the flare .",
    "the cog of dr1 moves to the north - east , while the cog of dr2 is directed to the south - west .",
    "the straight lines connecting the cogs of both dimming regions at the beginning and end of the analyzed time interval demonstrate that the cogs rotate clockwise around the ` center ' of the flare site .",
    "also , taking the east - west alignment of the postflare loops around 07:45  ut as a reference , the lines indicate that the observed rotation reflects the evolution of the dimmings from a ` sheared ' to a more ` potential ' configuration , as the event progresses .",
    "the successively appearing postflare loops exhibit the same sheared - to - potential evolution ( _ cf .",
    "_  figure  [ fig : evolution ] , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cog ] we consider the apparent motion of the cogs of the two dimming regions separately for the east - west ( @xmath19 ) and north - south ( @xmath20 ) direction .",
    "in addition , we compare the motion of the cogs with both the kinematics of the cme and the temporal evolution of the soft x - ray emission of the associated flare .",
    "the cogs of the dimming regions separate in the @xmath19-direction ( figure  [ fig : cog](a ) ) , while they approach each other in the @xmath20-direction ( figure  [ fig : cog](b ) ) . given the east - west alignment of the latest appearing postflare loops , the approaching in @xmath20 reflects the aforementioned evolution of the dimming regions from a ` sheared ' to a more ` potential ' configuration .",
    "the separation in @xmath19 indicates that the extent of the region , affected by the expelled cme , grows , as the event progresses .",
    "the most conspicuous movement of the cogs is detected between 05:50  ",
    "06:30  ut ( _ i.e. _ , after the impulsive acceleration phase of the cme ) . in this period ,",

    "[ fig : cog](d ) we also investigate the relationship between the acceleration phase of the cme and the energy release phase of the flare .",
    "the maximum cme acceleration occurs approx .",
    "11  min before the flare - related maximum of the soft x - ray ( sxr ) emission .",
    "in other words , the highest cme acceleration occurs in the impulsive phase of the flare , during which the flare energy is released and particles are accelerated to nonthermal energies . since observations of nonthermal emission ( hard x - rays , microwaves produced by these particles ) are not available for the event under study",

    "the maxima in the sxr time derivative and cme acceleration profile are roughly co - temporal .",

    "we apply the procedure described in section  [ sec : analysis ] , _ i.e. _ , we track the fastest part of the cme front in sta / euvi 171   running difference images and calculate the velocity from a linear fit to the height - time measurements . figure  [ fig:2methods](a ) shows an example of such a measurement . to estimate the error we repeat the measuring procedure several times and determine the mean and standard deviation of the calculated velocities .",
    "thus , we obtain a linear cme velocity of @xmath31 between 05:26 and 05:46  ut .    in the second method",
    "we use stb / euvi 171 and 195   _ on - disk _ observations of the region surrounding both the flare site and the small - scale twin dimmings . to select an appropriate fov , _",
    "i.e. _ , a fov covering the range over which the outermost border of the expanding global - scale dimmings is discernible , we visually track these dimmings in difference images .",
    "figure  [ fig:2methods](b ) shows the fov selected according to this criterion .",
    "we associate the expanding global - scale dimmings with the 1  mk and 1.5  mk plasma , rarefied or ejected in the course of the cme ( _ cf .",
    "we calculate the intensity profiles for both wavelengths , integrating over the entire fov of figure  [ fig:2methods](b ) ( global light curve ) .",
    "we then normalize both profiles to the pre - flare intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig:2methods](c ) shows that the intensity drops down to a level of 8790% of the pre - flare euv flux on a timescale of @xmath32  min ( 05:26    05:56  ut ) .",
    "this is the period over which the cme clears the fov , because afterwards the intensity level in both wavelengths stabilizes .",
    "the average velocity of the cme in this period is calculated as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the distance shown in figure  [ fig:2methods](b ) . to estimate @xmath36 we use both the euvi 171  and 195   light curves and determine the times when the intensity drop in both profiles starts and ends ( _ cf . _",
    "shaded box in figure  [ fig:2methods](c ) , highlighting the time interval @xmath36 ) .",
    "this yields an average speed of @xmath37 . due to the image cadence of 5  min for stb 171   and 10  min for stb 195   ,",
    "however , @xmath36 is likely to be overestimated , since the actual intensity drop may start later , namely , between the time of the last pre - event intensity image and the time of the first ` intensity - drop ' image .",
    "similarly , the actual intensity drop may end earlier , namely , between the time of the last intensity - drop image and the time of the first image with stabilized intensity .",
    "assuming that the overestimation of @xmath36 is up to 10  min , we obtain an average speed of @xmath38 . taking the mean of both velocity values we obtain an average speed of @xmath39 .",
    "both the ` above - the - limb ' method ( cme tracking ) and the ` on - disk ' method ( expanding global - scale dimming ) yield comparable results .",
    "taking advantage of the quadrature of the stereo ahead and behind spacecraft on 13 february 2009 , we presented the first direct comparison of cme - associated , coronal euv dimmings observed simultaneously on the solar disk and above the solar limb . both data sets yield a consistent picture of the eruption and mass loss during the early phase of the cme , and thus , support the view that above - the - limb dimmings and global - scale , on - disk dimmings essentially reflect the same process , namely , the density rarefication in the corona due to the expelled cme .",
    "we compared the dimming process with the kinematics of the cme and found that during the period of strongest cme acceleration ( approx .",
    "05:2505:50  ut ) the euv intensity in both data sets dropped abruptly .",
    "also , the mass loss rates , inferred from both on - disk and above - the - limb euvi intensity observations , showed a distinct extremum in this period , suggesting that the bulk of the coronal mass was ejected , as the cme left the sun .",
    "moreover , the extrema of the cme acceleration profile and mass loss rates were only a few minutes apart in time , reflecting the close temporal relationship between the kinematics of the cme and the dimming process .",
    "two hours after the eruption , both the euvi  195   mass loss rates and the dopplergram derived from fe  xii  195.12   observations with the _ hinode_/eis instrument indicated that the loss of coronal plasma with a temperature of 1.5  mk had virtually stopped .",
    "the main characteristics of the dimmings in the event under study were comparable with other findings .",
    "for example , an intensity decrease within 2030  min and a gradual recovery of the euv brightness lasting several hours are characteristic features of the coronal dimming process ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , the observed amount of intensity drop , including the difference in brightness decrease between small - scale and global - scale dimmings , is typical for the two types of dimmings @xcite . also , the initial growing of dimming areas as well as the apparent motion of these regions away from the source region of the eruption was reported earlier @xcite . in the 13 february 2009 cme event , however , we observed for the first time an additional motion pattern of the small - scale twin dimming regions , namely , an apparent clockwise rotation around the source region of the eruption or the ` center ' of the flare site , respectively . taking the orientation of the first and last appearing postflare loops as a reference , this rotation can also be described as a sheared - to - potential migration , superposed on the outward motion .",
    "how can we explain such an apparent rotation ?",
    "small - scale twin dimmings are often interpreted as the confined footpoint areas of a cme - associated , erupting flux rope @xcite .",
    "the footpoints of a flux rope , however , are stationary .",
    "therefore , moving bipolar dimmings represent not only the footpoints of the flux rope , but also other regions , where field lines are stretched . from mhd simulations the destabilization and subsequent eruption of flux ropes / cmes is often achieved by twisting magnetic field structures ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "associated dimming regions can as well be located at large distances from the source region of the eruption .",
    "for example , @xcite reported dimmings at the footpoints of transequatorial loops that connected a flaring active region to an active region located in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "they proposed that the appearance of such dimmings is strongly related to the magnetic field topology : when low - lying , active - region loops rise and erupt , thus forming a characteristic twin dimming pattern , the overlying large - scale loops rise and erupt as well .",
    "@xcite described a scenario in which the arcade above the erupting flux rope expands significantly before reconnecting . in this case ,",
    "twin dimmings are expected to appear not only at the footpoints of the erupting flux rope , but also at the footpoints of the sheared magnetic arcade , as the expansion occurs .",
    "bearing in mind this idea we propose a magnetic field topology in the event under study that may explain the observed rotation and outward migration of the small - scale twin dimming regions dr1 and dr2 as well as the appearance of less and less sheared postflare loops , as the eruption progresses ( _ cf . _  figure  [ fig : drmovement ] ) . before the eruption , a magnetic separatrix layer divides the flux rope from the overlying arcade that spans the polarity inversion line ( pil ) .",
    "the inner loops of this arcade , _",
    "i.e. _ , loops that are rooted closer to the pil , are strongly sheared , low - lying loops , whereas the loop tops of the less and less sheared outer loops are at successively higher altitudes .",
    "once the magnetic configuration has become unstable the flux rope erupts . as a consequence ,",
    "the field lines of the flux rope are stretched and the first dimmings appear near its footpoints , _",
    "i.e. _ , at strongly sheared positions .",
    "when the erupting flux rope encounters the field lines of the arcade , it stretches them while it continues to rise . shortly before the stretched field lines reconnect , dimmings appear near their footpoints . since the loop tops of the overlying arcade are located at different heights , the low - lying , inner loops , rooted at strongly sheared positions , are stretched before the large - scale , outer loops , whose footpoints are less and less sheared .",
    "therefore , the respective dimmings appear at different times and positions , and the observer gets the impression of rotating twin dimming regions or dimmings that evolve from a ` sheared ' to a more ` potential ' configuration while they move away from the source region of the eruption , respectively . once the stretched field lines of the overlying arcade reconnect , their upper parts supply the erupting flux rope with new poloidal flux , while their lower parts form the postflare loops .",
    "since the first appearing postflare loops are created from the low - lying , inner , and strongly sheared loops , they are strongly sheared themselves , whereas the later appearing postflare loops are created from the less and less sheared outer loops , and thus , have a more and more potential configuration .    in analyzing the behavior of the relatively small twin dimmings dr1 and dr2 on the solar surface",
    "we reach the conclusion that the observed motion pattern reflects not only the eruption of the flux rope , but also the ensuing stretching of the overlying arcade .",
    "the above - the - limb dimming region dr - l , however , is larger than dr1 and dr2 by a factor of 100 ( _ cf .",
    "_  top panel of figure  [ fig : dr_size ] and figure  [ fig : limb_dimmings](b ) ) , and thus , rather represents the vast cross section of the coronal volume , evacuated by the cme .",
    "finally , the existence of both sta and stb / euvi observations of the 13 february 2009 cme event allowed us for the first time to compare directly two methods of deriving the cme velocity in the initial stage of the eruption .",
    "the velocity values obtained from above - the - limb observations of the leading edge of the cme ( cme tracking ) and on - disk observations of the expanding global - scale dimmings were comparable ( @xmath31 and @xmath40 , respectively ) .",
    "this demonstrates that global - scale , on - disk dimmings , originating from the source region of the eruption , propagate with a speed similar to that of the leaving cme front , and thus , supports the general view that global - scale euv dimmings are on - disk signatures of cme launches .",
    "accordingly , they can be used as a means for identifying cme source regions and estimating initial cme velocities , which is of particular interest in connection with earth - directed halo cmes and space weather forecast .",
