    "recently , the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light has drawn considerable interest in the context of quantum information processing .",
    "the spatial degrees of freedom involved in oam @xcite provide a high - dimensional alphabet to quantum information processing ( i.e. qu@xmath4its instead of qubits ) @xcite . additionally ,",
    "since oam is associated with the topology of the electromagnetic field , the use of this observable in quantum entanglement may lead to states that are inherently robust against decoherence @xcite .",
    "the most popular oam analyzer when dealing with conservation , correlation and entanglement of oam consists of a so - called fork hologram @xcite , i.e. a binary phase hologram containing a fork in its center @xcite , together with a spatial - mode detector consisting of a single - mode fiber connected to a single - photon detector ; such analyzers have been used in the three - dimensional case , i.e. @xmath5 , by vaziri  _ et  al .",
    "_ , @xcite .",
    "in that experiment , proof of entanglement of the oam degree of freedom of two photons was given by showing that a generalized bell inequality was violated ; this scheme requires 6 detectors , namely 3 in each arm , and one has to measure @xmath6 coincidence count rates @xcite to perform a measurement for a single setting of the analyzers .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the use of spiral phase plates ( spps ) @xcite instead of phase holograms in an oam entanglement setup , enabling us to investigate high - dimensional entanglement with only _ two _ detectors .",
    "more specifically , we will consider spps that impose on an optical beam a _ non - integer _",
    "oam expectation value per photon , in units of @xmath7 @xcite . with such devices , combined with single - mode fibers to form quantum - state analyzers ,",
    "we propose to build an oam entanglement setup that is reminiscent of the usual setup to measure polarization entanglement @xcite , where the rotational settings of the analyzers ( polarizers in that case ) is varied",
    ". we will show that it is possible to identify spp analyzer settings , in the spirit of horizontal and vertical aligned polarizers , when using _",
    "spps , allowing observation of high - dimensional entanglement ( @xmath8 ) , in contrast to the polarization case ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these claims are supported by calculations ; we predict highly non - classical quantum correlations ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. stronger quantum correlation between two photons than the maximum correlation between two qubits ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a spp , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spp](a ) , is a transparent dielectric plate with a thickness that varies as a smooth ramp , thus phase shifting an incident field linearly with the azimuthal angle @xmath10 @xcite . as can be seen , the plate carries a screw discontinuity , expressed by the spiraling thickness , and an edge discontinuity , i.e. a radially oriented step with height @xmath11 .",
    "the difference between the maximum and minimum phase shift is written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is not necessarily integer ; in fact , @xmath13 depends on depends on the step height @xmath11 , the difference in refractive indices of the spp and surrounding medium , and the wavelength of the incident light @xcite .",
    "thus , a photon propagating through this plate will acquire an oam with expectation value equal to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "placing such a plate in the waist of laguerre - gaussian beam , the field in the exit plane just behind the plate will be described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) field states and @xmath17 is the operator representing the effect of the spp on the input mode .",

    "the lg free - space modes , enumerated by the ( integer ) indices @xmath26 and @xmath27 , form a complete basis of spatial modes .",
    "the lg index @xmath26 , which should not be confused with the spp step index @xmath13 , is related to the oam that is carried in that lg mode , namely @xmath28 per photon @xcite , while the index @xmath27 provides information on the number of nodes along a transverse radius of the mode . when placing a spp in a beam in a single lg mode",
    ", the output will generally be in a _",
    "superposition _ of lg modes and will be _ no _ longer _ invariant _ under free - space propagation . for integer values of the step index @xmath13 of the spp ,",
    "the edge discontinuity is effectively absent and this superposition will only be with respect to the lg - index @xmath27 @xcite . in that case , the intensity distribution of the mode will be doughnut - shaped in the far field . for non - integer @xmath13 values , the edge discontinuity does not vanish and the superposition of modes will also be with respect to the index @xmath26 , which is related to the oam of the mode @xcite .",
    "such superpositions consist in principle of an infinite number of lg components .",
    "effectively , this number is finite and increases with @xmath13 ; as an example , if @xmath29 , 11 lg components are sufficient to describe 87% of the field behind the spp , while for @xmath30 , 224 lg components are required . as spps with non - integer @xmath13 can _ create _ such high - dimensional superpositions of oam modes , we anticipate that , when employed suitably , they can also _ project _ onto such superpositions .",
    "we therefore propose to incorporate such non - integer spps in analyzers for oam states living in a high - dimensional hilbert space .    from a topological point of view ,",
    "spps with non - integer @xmath13 imprint a mixed screw - edge dislocation on an incident field .",
    "the result is rotational asymmetry of the imprinted phase distribution and thus of the emerging field , which becomes visible in the far - field intensity profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spp](b ) )",
    ". it is the orientation of the step in the transverse plane , that we wish to exploit as an analyzer setting in a new bipartite entanglement scheme .    since",
    "@xmath13 shall be chosen to have a non - integer value , it is important to realize that , when an incident field passes through an spp in combination with its _ complement _ ( i.e. a spp with the same step height and orientation , but an _ inverted _ vorticity ) , the beam basically passes through a plane - parallel plate that shifts the phase of the field , in an azimuthally uniform way , by @xmath12 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the identity operator and where we keep the exponent since @xmath33 for non - integer @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath17 is unitary , it follows that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hermitean conjugate of @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath35 and @xmath36 only differ by a multiplicative phase factor we can again use a plane - parallel plate in the experiment to compensate for this phase factor .",
    "similar to the uniform phase shift caused by the spp s base @xmath18 , we will neglect this phase shift as well , as it can be trivially dealt with .",
    "henceforth , the operator for the compensating spp , with inverted vorticity , will be represented by the operator @xmath35 .",
    "in the experiment on oam qutrits ( @xmath5 ) , fork holograms were used @xcite .",
    "those holograms can only modify the oam expectation value by an _ integer _",
    "number @xcite , depending on the diffraction order of the hologram .",
    "it also required the use of _ three _ analyzers in each arm of a spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) setup .",
    "in contrast , our proposed oam entanglement experiment uses _ non - integer _",
    "spp state detectors and only requires a _ single _ analyzer - detector combination in each arm .",
    "this scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ; it has been inspired by the setup used in polarization entanglement @xcite .",
    "the spps that are inserted in the two arms should be chosen to obey conservation of oam ( see also section  [ sec : entanglement ] ) .",
    "thus , if the classical pump beam does not contain any oam , a typical choice for the signal and idler spps would be to have step indices @xmath13 and @xmath37 respectively , where , in our case , @xmath13 should have a non - integer value .",
    "the role of the lenses in signal and idler path , l@xmath38 and l@xmath39 respectively , will be discussed in section  [ sec : entanglement ] . finally , single - mode fibers are indicated by f@xmath38 and f@xmath39 .    ) is inserted with a single - mode fiber f@xmath40 , together forming the analyzer .",

    ". we may orient these edges arbitrarily in the transverse plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , thus allowing their use as angular analyzers . when combined with a single - mode fiber , the spp with step index @xmath13 , set at an azimuthal angle @xmath41 ,",
    "projects the incident photon state out onto the oam state with expectation value @xmath37 with edge angle @xmath41 . as we will argue in section  [ sec : entanglement ] , the coincidence count rate will depend , like in polarization entanglement , only on the _ relative _ angle of the transverse axes .    we stress that , in spite of the superficial similarity between a polarizer and a non - integer spp , they are of course very different devices ; for example , while polarization corresponds to _ alignment _ , the spp edge corresponds to _ orientation_. in other words , with a polarizer , one can analyze the alignment of the electrical field oscillation , either horizontal or vertical , thus yielding a periodicity of @xmath43 when rotated . with a spp with non - integer @xmath13",
    "one can analyze the spatial orientation of a field , thus yielding a periodicity of @xmath19 when rotated ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : spp](b ) ) .",
    "thus we expect that the coincidence count rate will have a periodicity of @xmath19 when one of our analyzers is rotated .",
    "an equally important difference between the two cases is that , whereas polarization hilbert space is two dimensional , oam hilbert space is infinite dimensional .",
    "as we will see , this makes rotation of spps fundamentally different from rotation of a polarizer . in order to address these aspects explicitly ,",
    "we need a basis of the oam hilbert space that is suited for our purpose .",
    "our aim is to construct a complete , orthonormal basis that contains non - integer oam states as basis elements . to this end",
    ", we consider all states in the polar representation and separate the radial and angular parts , so that the arbitrary state @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 , where we have introduced the _ direction _ ( i.e. angular ) ket @xmath46 .",
    "this allows us to introduce a complete basis set of angular states , the eigenstates @xmath47 of the oam operator @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 . a laguerre - gaussian state can thus be separated into a radial and angular part , so that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radial part of the state , which is of less importance in this paper .",
    "the oam eigenstates can be transformed from integer to non - integer oam states . by applying a unitary operator to the integer oam basis , its completeness and orthonormality are conserved ; the unitary operator that we use is the spp operator , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sppoperator ] ) : @xmath52 the new basis @xmath53 has its components enumerated by @xmath26 , each with oam equal to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a constant ( not to be confused with the wavelength of the light ) .",
    "different values of @xmath56 define different bases of oam hilbert space , each basis being complete and orthonormal .    as an example , passing a photon in a fundamental gaussian mode @xmath57 through a spp with @xmath58 , creates the state @xmath59 ; sending this latter photon through a spp with an aligned step and @xmath60 , combined with a single - mode fiber , then yields a detection probability of unity .",
    "since we intend to rotate the non - integer spps , it is important to also have a description of the states that arise when the spp is rotated while the coordinate system is fixed . to gain insight",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] the phase shift imposed by a spp as a function of the azimuthal angle .    , while the dashed line shows the phase shift for a plate with its edge at @xmath61.,width=302 ]    the solid line represents the imprinted phase for a spp with its edge oriented at an angle @xmath62 , while the dashed line corresponds to a spp with edge orientation @xmath61 .",
    "we can now generalize the definition of the operator @xmath17 to the operator @xmath63 , which includes the orientation @xmath64 of the edge dislocation .",

    "note that the oam expectation value will be conserved along this path , as rotating the spp has , of course , no effect on its step height , i.e. on @xmath13 .",
    "when dealing with oam entanglement , issues of conservation of oam during the spontaneous parametric down - conversion process arise .",

    "it has been pointed out that in this case the use of @xmath107-sorting devices , such as stern - gerlach analyzers , does _ not _ offer access to higher - dimensional quantum correlations , presumably because the action of a stern - gerlach analyzer depends only on the alignment of its quantization axis @xcite . instead of larger spin values ( @xmath108 ) ,",
