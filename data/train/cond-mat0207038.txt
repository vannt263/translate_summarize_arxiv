    "doped quantum antiferromagnets ( qafm ) constitute a major unresolved problem in condensed matter physics , which is at the center of current research since the discovery of high @xmath1 superconductivity @xcite . in particular , the case of a doped spin liquid where no symmetry is spontaneously broken is very challenging , since the starting point , the spin liquid state , can not be described by a classical nel state .",
    "this problem is not only of theoretical relevance .",
    "@xmath2 ladders are present in @xmath3 and many experiments support the presence of a spin gap and a finite correlation length , two crucial ingredients signaling a spin liquid state . with isovalent @xmath4 substitution of @xmath5 holes are transferred from the @xmath6 chains to the ladders  @xcite , increasing the conductivity of the latter .",
    "the spin gap , as measured by knight shift or nmr experiments is seen to diminish . with increasing doping , superconductivity is ultimately stabilized under pressure @xcite , a phenomenon that suffices to justify the interest for the subject .",
    "the simplest model which is believed to grasp the physics of the problem is the @xmath7 model on a two leg ladder .",
    "it is believed in general that this system evolves continuously from the isotropic case to the limit of strong rung interaction . in this limit",
    "some simplifying pictures are at hand : without doping the gap is the energy of promoting a singlet rung to a triplet ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "interaction among the rungs leads eventually to the usual magnon band . upon doping the systems",
    "shows two different kinds of spin excitations  @xcite .",
    "one is still the singlet - triplet transition as before , the other kind corresponds to the splitting of a hole pair into a couple of quasiparticles ( formed by a spinon and an holon ) , each carrying charge @xmath9 and spin 1/2 .",
    "the number of possible excitations is proportional to @xmath10 ( for the magnons ) and @xmath11 ( for the quasiparticles ) , respectively , where @xmath12 is the number of holes per copper sites .",
    "for this reason , at low doping concentration , the magnon gap will be the most important in influencing the form of the static susceptibility or dynamical structure factor .",
    "first sigrist  @xcite and more recently lee @xcite attacked the problem ultimately with some sort of mean field decoupling .",
    "their results agree in predicting an increase of the magnon gap ( @xmath13 , originated from the singlet - triplet transition ) , while lee were also able to calculate a decrease of the quasiparticle gap ( @xmath14 originated from the splitting of a hole pair ) for small doping concentrations .",
    "in contrast to the mean - field results above , ammon  @xcite obtained a decrease of the magnon gap and an almost doping independent @xmath15 using temperature density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) .",
    "as already mentioned , a decrease of the spin gap is also observed in a number of experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the behavior of the magnon gap upon doping . due to the contradiction above it",
    "is imperative to go beyond mean field and include the role of fluctuations in a controlled manner . a mapping from an afm heisenberg model to an effective field theory ,",
    "the non linear @xmath16 model ( ) , proved very efficient in describing the magnetic properties of two dimensional spin lattices @xcite , chains  @xcite , and ladders  @xcite .",
    "this mapping was extended in ref.@xcite to the case of a doped two dimensional qafm using a procedure that we will closely follow .",
    "since no satisfactory analytical treatment of the @xmath17 model away from half filling is possible at present , we focus on the so called spin - fermion model .",
    "this hamiltonian can be derived in fourth order degenerate perturbation theory  @xcite from the @xmath18 , three band , emery model  @xcite , that gives a detailed description of the cuprate materials . there",
    "the role of perturbation is played by the hybridization term between the @xmath19-orbital ( oxygen ) and the @xmath20-orbital ( copper ) . a further simplification of the model was proposed by zhang and rice  @xcite , that leads to the @xmath7 model .    a typical copper - oxide two leg ladder , as those present in @xmath21 is depicted in fig .  [ laddfig ] .",
    "it is generally accepted that the dopant holes reside on _",
    "p_-orbitals on the oxygens sites , whereas on the @xmath22 ions a localized hole resides , represented by spin 1/2 operator which interact via a nearest neighbor exchange .",
    "the spin - fermion hamiltonian is defined as follows :    @xmath23    the index @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) runs over the cu ( o ) sites , @xmath26 creates a hole in an oxygen @xmath27 band and @xmath28 are spin operators for the copper ions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 take care of the sign of the p - d overlap and @xmath30 if @xmath31 or @xmath32 and @xmath33 if @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "finally the operator @xmath36 is defined as    @xmath37    following  @xcite we can define the following operator centered on the copper site @xmath38 which represents non orthogonal orbitals with a high weight on the @xmath39 site .",
    "their anti - commutation relations are @xmath40 and we can rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of these operators as follows    @xmath41    @xmath42 is the number of the rungs along the ladder and @xmath43 distinguishes the two legs . for the sake of generality , an anisotropy in the heisenberg term",
    "is allowed .",
    "the different steps of our procedure are the following : first find orthogonal ( wannier states ) for the holes , then go to a ( coherent states ) path integral formulation for spins and fermions and perform the gaussian integration of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the remaining part of the calculation is devoted to the evaluation of the resulting fermi determinant in the long - wavelength low - frequency limit .",
    "this expansion includes the coupling constant @xmath44 to all order .",
    "wannier states are easily find via @xmath45where @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the lattice constant and we used a two dimensional fourier transform where @xmath48 takes only values @xmath49 and @xmath50 distinguishing between symmetric ( bonding ) and antisymmetric ( antibonding ) states .",
    "the partition function can be expressed as a path integral    @xmath51 d\\left [ f\\right ] d [ \\hat{\\omega } ]   e^{-s_{sf } } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath52 .",
    "the action @xmath53 contains all terms with spins degree of freedoms only  @xcite :    @xmath54 , \\label{eq : s - spin}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is a unimodular field , @xmath56 is the spin per site ( @xmath57 in our case ) and @xmath58 is the vector potential for a ( dirac ) monopole : @xmath59 .",
    "it is by now well accepted that the effective low energy field theory of the @xmath60-dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic model is given by the @xmath61  @xcite . in the case of a ladder one obtains the @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , here we will deal mainly with the part of the action which contains fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath63 :    @xmath64 f_{q,\\beta},\\label{sh}\\ ] ]    here @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the fermionic matsubara frequency and @xmath67 .",
    "it is natural to decompose the inverse propagator into @xmath68 where the free part is @xmath69 and the fluctuating external potential is @xmath70    since , according to eq .",
    "( [ sh ] ) the action @xmath71 is bilinear in the fermionic variables , we can integrate them out .",
    "this leads to @xmath72 . defining the matrix @xmath73 and a rescaled propagator @xmath74 through @xmath75",
    "we can write @xmath76 the first term gives just a constant and we can ignore it .",
    "again we decompose the rescaled inverse propagator as @xmath77 which brings us to @xmath78    the remaining part of the calculation is devoted to the evaluation of @xmath79 in the continuum limit .",
    "as we already mentioned , in the undoped regime where no holes are present , it has proven very effective a mapping from a antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin ladder to a ( 1 + 1 ) nl@xmath80 m .",
    "this mapping rely on the idea that although long range order ( here antiferromagnetic ) is prohibited in one dimension , the most important contribution to the action are given by paths in which antiferromagnetic order survives at short distance . accordingly the dynamical unimodular field is decomposed in a nel modulated field @xmath81 plus a ferromagnetic fluctuating contribution .",
    "a gradient expansion in the dynamical field brings then to the ( 1 + 1 ) nl@xmath0 m .",
    "the gradient expansion is justified when the correlation length of the spin is much larger than the lattice constant @xmath82 .",
    "however the prediction of the , a finite correlation length and a triplet of massive modes above the ground state  @xcite remain valid until @xmath83 as numerical calculations on the isotropic heisenberg ladder have shown  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of this work is then that such a parameterization is still meaningful as long as the spin liquid state is not destroyed by doping , as seems to be the case in experiments , where a finite spin - gap is also seen in the doped case  .",
    "then , as e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite , we parameterize the spin field in the following way @xmath84    @xmath85 and @xmath86 are two slowly varying , orthogonal , vector fields describing locally antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations , respectively .",
    "@xmath85 is normalized such that @xmath87 .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath47 in front of @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : param1 ] ) makes explicit the fact that @xmath88 is proportional to a generator of rotations of @xmath89 , namely to a first - order derivative of @xmath89 .    in the particular geometry of a ladder",
    ", this decomposition give rise to two local order parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "however we assume that spins across the chain are rather strongly correlated such that they will sum up to give rise to an antiferromagnetic configuration , or subtract and give a ferromagnetic fluctuation .",
    "a further parameterization is then @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the next step is the gradient expansion , or equivalently , in fourier space , an expansion in powers of @xmath95 . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions the field @xmath96 will get no scaling dimension , whereas the fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 get scaling dimension -1 .",
    "accordingly , in the subsequent expansion we will need to keep terms with up to two derivative and any power of the field @xmath99 .",
    "terms containing @xmath100 are marginal whenever two fields or one field and one derivative are present .",
    "higher order terms are irrelevant and will be discarded .",
    "this correspond to expand all our quantities up to @xmath101 .",
    "the self energy has then the following expansion @xmath102 where the various quantity are @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the antiferromagnetic modulation vector suitable for a ladder geometry .",
    "we also regroup the zero - th order term in @xmath105 .",
    "the evaluation of the various contribution in the continuum limit , proceeds very similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer to that paper for a more detailed explanation .",
    "the quantity to be evaluated is @xmath106 we need then to find the inverse of @xmath107 up to @xmath108 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath109 where the various matrices are @xmath110 and we used the shorthand notation @xmath111    we first consider the term @xmath112    the second term of this equation is reduced to the calculation of @xmath113 where each term has the following expansion @xmath114 with @xmath115 an even integer . the trace over the pauli matrices can be carried out using a trace reduction formula  @xcite . the gradient expansion in eq .",

    "( [ eq : trln ] ) .",
    "this does not present particular problems , since after expanding all the quantities , it reduces to the evaluation of a finite number of traces .",
    "the result is @xmath120 here we omitted to write a gaussian term @xmath121 , completely decoupled , which can be integrated out without further consequences .",
    "the quantities @xmath122 and @xmath123 are given by @xmath124^{2 } .",
    "\\label{chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    they are generalized susceptibilities of the holes in presence of long - wavelength spin fields . in particular the zeros of @xmath125 determine the dispersion of such holes .",
    "the bands originating in such a way correspond to free holes moving in a staggered magnetic field .",
    "such a staggered field would break translation invariance by one site and we would obtain four bands in the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "instead in our procedure we never broke explicitly translation invariance , so that we obtain genuinely two bands in the brillouin zone .",
    "the lowest of these two band is symmetric in character ( bonding ) . in fig .",
    "[ mfband ] we show it for values of the constants relevant for the copper - oxide ladder a band - width of @xmath126 ev   and @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "this band is in good agreement with accurate calculations on the one hole spectrum of the @xmath17 model . in particular , in the isotropic @xmath17 model , for @xmath128 the same qualitative feature are observed : a global maximum at @xmath129 , global minima at @xmath130 and local maxima at @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "ev.the minimum falls exactly at @xmath132,width=302,height=226 ]    now that we calculated the long wavelength contribution coming from the holes , we still have to consider the continuum limit ( in the low energy sector ) of the pure spin action @xmath133 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - spin ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath134    the very last step is the gaussian integration of the @xmath135 field , leaving us with the effective long - wavelength action for the antiferromagnetic order parameter , a ( 1 + 1 ) nl@xmath0 m :    @xmath136 , \\ ] ]    where the nl@xmath0 m parameters are given by @xmath137 } -\\frac{\\bar{\\chi } _ { \\tau \\tau } } { 2}\\right ) \\right ] ^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{eqf}\\\\   v & = & a \\left [ \\frac{\\left ( s^2 j_{\\|}-\\frac{\\bar{\\chi } _ { xx}}{2}\\right ) } { \\left ( \\frac{\\left ( 1+\\frac{g^{3}}{s}\\hat{\\chi } _ { \\tau } \\right ) ^{2}}{\\left[4j_{||}+2j_\\perp    + \\frac{g^{2}}{s^{2}}\\tilde{\\chi } \\right ] } -\\frac{\\bar{\\chi } _ { \\tau \\tau } } { 2}\\right ) } \\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } .\\label{eqv } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , the spin - fermion model with mobile holes interacting with an antiferromagnetic background is mapped into an effective nl@xmath0 m whose coupling constant depend on doping through the generalized susceptibilities in eqs.([chi0 ] ) , ( [ chi1 ] ) , and ( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "now we can immediately transpose to our model of a doped spin liquid , some known result for the nl@xmath0 m , mainly the presence of a gap which separates the singlet ground state from a triplet of magnetic excitations .",
    "this gap should persist as long as the continuum approximation is valid .",
    "the fact that the nl@xmath0 m in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension has a gap above the ground state can be established in a variety of ways . using the two loop beta function  @xcite one obtains @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a cutoff of the order of the inverse lattice constant .",
    "now we have an explicit analytic form for the doping dependence of the spin gap in the spin - liquid state of a two leg ladder .    to study the behavior of the gap with doping we have to distinguish two regimes where the lowest effective band has minimum either at zero or at @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath141 the minima fall in @xmath142 . here",
    "all the generalized susceptibilities in eqs.([chi0 ] ) , ( [ chi1 ] ) , and ( [ chi2 ] ) contribute to lower @xmath143 and , since from eq .",
    "( [ gap - eq ] ) @xmath144 is an increasing function of @xmath143 , they make the gap smaller for any value of the constants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : decrease ] ) .",
    "this is comforting , since , as we mentioned , for @xmath145 very large the physics of the spin - fermion model should be similar to that of the @xmath17 model  @xcite , and for that one , tdmrg simulations show that the gap decreases at least in a strong anisotropic case ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "when @xmath147 the band minimum falls in zero and there is one susceptibility , @xmath123 , which instead makes @xmath143 grow .",
    "in this regime there is then a ( small ) region of parameters where the gap grows with doping ( see figure  [ fig : increase ] ) .    before passing to a comparison with experiments , we want to comment on a possible simplifying understanding .",
    "a simple picture to explain the observed diminishing of the spin gap with doping in @xmath148 , is that ( at least for low doping concentration where speaking of a spin liquid is still feasible ) the effect of the holes is that of renormalizing the anisotropy parameter @xmath149 for the spin part towards larger values . in many studies on the 2 leg ladder heisenberg antiferromagnet",
    "@xcite , the spin gap is seen to increase with @xmath150 .",
    "in fact , the same occurs in the   without doping in the range @xmath151 .",
    "we can now pass to our mapping of a doping spin liquid to an effective nl@xmath16 m . according to equations ( [ eqf],[eqv ] ) effective coupling constants @xmath152",
    "can be defined for the doped system such that the form of the nl@xmath153 m parameters is that for a pure spin system  @xcite @xmath154    a small doping expansion in the regime @xmath141 leads to @xmath155 so indeed @xmath156 , @xmath157 are seen respectively to increase , decrease , such that @xmath150 decreases .",
    "however , such an interpretation breaks down beyond @xmath158 whereas @xmath159 are still well defined positive constants .",
    "this means that beyond such doping , this simplified picture can not be navely applied and holes have a more effective way of lowering the gap .",
    "we come now to the comparison with experiments .",
    "our theory depends on four parameters @xmath160 which we now want to fix to physical values .",
    "arpes experiment on @xmath161 were performed by takahashi  @xcite who found a band matching the periodicity of the ladder with a bandwidth of @xmath162 ev . adjusting our lowest band to have such a bandwidth we obtain a relation between @xmath163 and @xmath164 . on the other hand , experiments on the cuo@xmath165 cell materials and band theory calculation  @xcite agreed in assuming a value of @xmath145 of the order of @xmath166 ev .",
    "this in turn gives us a value of @xmath167 ev , which is also consistent with the same calculation .",
    "the debate around an anisotropy of the spin exchange constants   in @xmath3 seems now to be resolved in favor of isotropy or light anisotropy of the coupling constant : @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "we adjusted the value of the momentum cutoff @xmath139 by fixing the theoretical gap with the experimental one for the undoped compound @xmath169 . finally , to compare with the measured values of the gap for different doping concentration @xmath170 in @xmath171 ( where @xmath172 can be either divalent @xmath173 or trivalent @xmath174 )",
    ", we still need a relation between the a substitution @xmath170 and the number of holes per copper site present in the ladder @xmath175 .",
    "this is another unsettled issue of the telephone number compound .",
    "in particular osafune  @xcite studying the optical conductivity spectrum , inferred that with increasing ca substitution @xmath170 , holes are transferred from the chain to the ladder . on the other hand ncker  @xcite",
    "argue that in the series compound @xmath148 the number of holes in the ladder is almost insensitive to ca substitution @xmath170 ( although a small increase is observed ) . here",
    "we will assume that @xmath171 is an example of doped spin liquid and will use the data from  @xcite .",
    "the result of our theory can be seen in figure  [ fig - theo_kumagai ] .",
    "there we used isotropic exchange constant , but the theoretical curve did not change in a visible way if an anisotropy of @xmath176 was inserted .",
    "we see from the figure that the spin gap becomes zero for @xmath177 , beyond this value the coupling constants @xmath143 and @xmath178 would become imaginary signaling that our effective model cease to make sense .",
    "this means that for such doping ratios our parameterization  ( [ eq : param1 ] ) is no longer valid , in the sense that it does not incorporate the most important spin configurations .",
    "however our theory could cease to make sense much before . if one takes the point of view of the @xmath17 model",
    "( as we said the spin - fermion model should map to it for large @xmath145 ) the holes introduced in the system couple rigidly to the spins forming singlet with the @xmath179 states . in the worst case",
    "this would limit the correlation length of the spin to the mean hole - hole distance @xmath180 . in our case",
    "this happens at a doping ratio of @xmath181 .",
    "a word of caution should be mentioned with respect to comparison with experimental results .",
    "a still unresolved controversy is present between nmr   and neutron scattering   experiments , where the latter see essentially no doping dependence of the spin gap . without being able to resolve this issue",

    "in this paper we studied the behavior of the spin gap of a two leg heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder as microscopically many holes are introduced in the system .",
    "such a situation can be physically realized in the series compound @xmath171 with a = ca , y , la , and numerous result are now available from experiments . on the theoretical side",
    ", however , there is a contradiction between previous analytical treatments on the one hand , and tdmrg simulations or nmr experiments on the other hand .",
