    "this project aims at extending the standard model ( sm ) in such a way that there would be no quadratic divergences up to the leading order at the two - loop level of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the quadratic divergences were first discussed within the sm by veltman  @xcite , who , adopting dimensional reduction  @xcite , found the following quadratically divergent one - loop contribution to the higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) mass @xmath4 , \\label{hcor}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a uv cutoff and @xmath6 denotes the  of the scalar doublet .",
    "the issue of quadratic divergences was then investigated further in  @xcite and @xcite .    within the sm precision measurements require a light higgs boson , therefore the correction ( [ hcor ] ) exceeds the mass itself even for small values of @xmath7 , e.g. for @xmath8 one obtains @xmath9 already for @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the scale of new physics is widely separated from the electro - weak scale , then constraints that emerge from analysis of operators of dimension 6 require @xmath11 a few tev .",
    "the lesson from this observation is that regardless of what physics lies beyond the sm , some amount of fine tuning is necessary ; either we tune to lift the cutoff above @xmath10 , or we tune when precision observables measured at lep are fitted .",
    "tuning both in corrections to the higgs mass and in lep physics is , of course , also a viable alternative which we are going to explore below .",
    "so , we will look for new physics in the tev range which will allow to lift the cutoff implied by quadratic corrections to @xmath12 to the multi - tev range _ and _ which will be consistent with all the experimental constraints  both require some amount of tuning . note that within the sm the requirement @xmath13 implies an unrealistic value of the higgs boson mass @xmath14 .",
    "here we are going to argue that the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) in certain region of its parameter space can soften the little hierarchy problem both by suppressing quadratic corrections to scalar masses _ and _ it allows to lift the central value for the lightest higgs mass .",
    "in order to accommodate cp violation we consider here a 2hdm with softly broken @xmath15 symmetry which acts as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( all other fields are neutral ) .",
    "the scalar potential then reads @xmath18\\right\\ }   + \\frac12 \\lam_1 ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)^2   + \\frac12 \\lam_2 ( \\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2   \\nonumber   \\\\ & &   + \\lambda_3(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2 )   + \\lambda_4(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_1 )   + \\frac12\\left[\\lambda_5(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2 + \\hc\\right ]   \\label{2hdmpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the minimization conditions at @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be formulated as follows : m_11 ^ 2= v_1 ^ 2_1+v_2 ^ 2(_345 - 2 ) , m_22 ^ 2=v_2 ^ 2_2+v_1 ^ 2(_345 - 2 ) , [ min ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .      at the one - loop level the cancellation of quadratic divergences for the scalar green s functions at zero external momenta ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) in the 2hdm type ii model implies  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and we use the notation : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that when @xmath30 is large , the two quark contributions can be comparable . in the type ii model",
    "the mixed , @xmath31 , green s function is not quadratically divergent .    the quartic couplings @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of the mass parameters and elements of the rotation matrix needed for diagonalization of the scalar masses ( see , for example , eqs .",
    "( 3.1)(3.5 ) of @xcite ) . therefore , for a given choice of @xmath33 s , the squared neutral - higgs masses @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be determined from the cancellation conditions ( [ qdcon1_mod2])([qdcon2_mod2 ] ) in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the leading contributions to quadratic divergences are of the form of @xmath42 .",
    "they could be determined adopting a method noticed by einhorn and jones  @xcite , so that the cancellation conditions for quadratic divergences up to the leading two - loop order read : _",
