    "in a recent paper , onatski , moreira and hallin ( 2011 ) ( hereafter omh ) analyze the asymptotic power of statistical tests in the detection of a signal in spherical real - valued gaussian data as the dimensionality of the data and the number of observations diverge to infinity at the same rate .",

    "( 2010 ) , and cai and ma ( 2012 ) ) consider general alternatives to the null of sphericity .",
    "our interest in alternatives with only a few contaminating signals stems from the fact that in many applications , such as speech recognition , macroeconomics , finance , wireless communication , genetics , physics of mixture , and statistical learning , a few latent variables typically explain a large portion of the variation in high - dimensional data ( see baik and silverstein ( 2006 ) for references ) . as a possible explanation of this fact , johnstone ( 2001 ) introduces the spiked covariance model , where all eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix of high - dimensional data are equal except for a small fixed number of distinct spike eigenvalues .",
    "the alternative to the null of sphericity considered in this paper coincides with johnstone s model .",
    "the extension from the single - spiked alternatives  of omh to the multi - spiked alternatives  considered here , however , is all but straightforward .",
    "the difficulty arises because the extension of the main technical tool in omh ( lemma  2 ) , which analyzes high - dimensional spherical integrals , to integrals over high - dimensional real stiefel manifolds obtained in onatski ( 2012 ) is not easily amenable to the laplace approximation method used in omh .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we develop a completely different technique , inspired from the large deviation analysis of spherical integrals by guionnet and maida ( 2005 ) .",
    "let us describe the setting and main results in more detail .",

    "use this link to establish a representation of the integral in the form of a contour integral ( see wang ( 2010 ) and mo ( 2011 ) for independent different derivations of this contour integral representation for this particular @xmath46 case ) . then",
    ", the laplace approximation to the contour integral is used to derive the asymptotic behavior of @xmath34 .",
    "onatski ( 2012 ) generalizes the contour integral representation to the multispiked case ( @xmath47 ) . for complex - valued data ,",
    "such a generalization allows him to extend omh s results to the multi - spiked context .",
    "unfortunately , for real - valued data , which we are concerned with in this paper , this generalization is not straightforwardly amenable to the laplace approximation method . therefore , in this paper , we consider a totally different approach . for the @xmath46 case , guionnet and maida ( 2005 ) ( hereafter gm ) use large deviation methods to derive a second - order asymptotic expansion of @xmath41 as the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath44 diverge to infinity ( see their theorem 3 ) .",

    "although this limiting process is gaussian , it is not a log - likelihood process of the gaussian shift type , so that the statistical experiments @xmath59 under study are not locally asymptotically normal ( lan ) ones .",
    "the weak convergence of @xmath62 implies , however , via le cam s first lemma ( see van der vaart 1998 , p.88 ) , that the joint distributions of the normalized sample covariance eigenvalues under the null and under alternatives associated with @xmath63 are mutually contiguous .",
    "an asymptotic power envelope for @xmath35-based tests of @xmath37 against @xmath64 can be constructed using the neyman - pearson lemma and le cam s third lemma .",

    "we find that , in general , the asymptotic powers of those tests are substantially lower than the corresponding asymptotic power envelope value .",
