    "fourier transforms are used to reveal underlying periodicities in functions and data which include oscillatory components and yield the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases of contributing harmonic terms .",
    "the function could be a series of analytical functions with an infinite graph like a sine wave , or it could be a few thousand data points gathered over years of studying variable stars .",
    "the fourier analysis method is flexible , though it originated with pure math applied to a problem in heat transfer .",
    "what is commonly referred to as modern fourier analysis is based on the work that joseph fourier did over two hundred years ago .",
    "fourier transforms are well known in communications , but the discussion here is focused on analysis of functions and data .",
    "fourier transforms reveal the frequencies , amplitudes , and phases modeling the data as a series of oscillatory components ( sines and cosines , or complex exponentials ) .",
    "fourier analysis is applied in many areas of medicine , science , and engineering and addresses a wide array of analysis problems .",
    "computing fourier transforms by explicit integration took vast amounts of computing time in past decades and was rarely used .",
    "the advent of fast fourier transforms @xcite was welcomed enthusiastically and came to dominate the technique .",
    "since the sampling theorem tells us that no information is lost using ffts on waveforms that are band limited to half the sampling rate , @xcite many believe that the fft provides the most accurate data analysis possible for a given data set .",
    "ffts manipulate data quickly and accurately in many of the electronic devices we enjoy today .",
    "the wide use of ffts in communications is often taken as a go - ahead to use ffts in data analysis .",
    "it may be erroneous to assume that , since no information is lost , explicit integration ( ei ) methods offer no advantages .",
    "this paper addresses whether the ei method of fourier transform computation offers advantages over the fft .",
    "fft and ei methods are used to analyze data sets with a variety of applications , specifically comparing results for frequency , amplitude , and phase of the output functions .",
    "accuracy of the two methods is compared using data sets over a wide variety of time scales .    in real time communications , speed is essential , but speed is often less important in data and functional analysis .",
    "ei methods have been avoided because they require on the order of @xmath1 computer operations ; whereas , fft methods require on the order of @xmath2 computer operations for a set of n data points .",
    "for example , the cooley and tukey @xcite fft implementation requires approximately @xmath3 computer operations ; whereas , faster implementations like fftw3 require approximately @xmath4 computer operations @xcite . on personal computers ,",
    "an ei transform of 10,000 data points might take 30 seconds . with today",
    "s computing power , even a fourier transform that has to run overnight should not be considered burdensome for data sets that take years to collect or cost millions of dollars .",
    "the hypothesis of this paper is that explicit integration will yield more accurate frequency , amplitude , and phase determinations of periodicities in data sets for peaks that are well resolved in fourier transforms .",
    "data were gathered from multiple sources .",
    "methods of analyzing the data differed slightly between categories , to keep uncertainties as low as possible .",
    "methods for different data sets are described below , beginning with the cosine series , continuing with data from longer to shorter time scales , and ending with the cosine series with added random noise .",
    "all data , once analyzed with the fourier methods , were represented graphically to quantify differences in frequency , amplitude , and phase of prominent peaks after ei and fft analysis of the same data set .",
    "if the different analysis methods are completely equivalent , results should show the same frequency , amplitude , and phase of well resolved peaks , meaning the fft should have the same level of detail as the ei method .",
    "the fft code employs the fftw3 @xcite libraries created and distributed by mit .",
    "the ei code is a simple numerical integration algorithm employing complex math functions .",
    "prior to computing fourier transforms , data were vertically translated so that spectral leakage of a large dc component did not obscure the resulting frequency spectra . both amplitude and phase were output from the numerical fourier transforms .",
    "a constraint of fft methods is that the step size in frequency ( called the bin size or bin width in many fields ) is always the reciprocal of the sampling interval .",
    "for example , a sample interval of @xmath5 yields an fft frequency step size of @xmath6 .",
    "since ei methods do not have this constraint , step sizes were chosen to be at least 10 times smaller than the fft step size to more accurately determine the frequency at which peaks occur and the corresponding phase and amplitude at the peak .",
    "peaks selected for comparisons were well above the noise and were individually selected for each data category .",
    "peaks were consistent through the data sets in each category .",
    "values of frequency , amplitude , and phase were determined when the amplitude was selected from the highest point of a peak . in cases",
    "where frequency , amplitude , and/or phase values are known independently from fourier transform results , root mean squared ( rms ) deviations from the known good value were computed .",
    "in all test cases , rms deviations were computed between peak amplitudes , corresponding frequencies , and corresponding phases independently obtained by the two methods on identical source data .",
    "the rms frequency errors were computed relative to the expected line width , which is the reciprocal of the time window .",
    "for example , a time window of @xmath7 produces a line width of @xmath8 , so rms frequency errors are reported relative to @xmath8 in this case .",
    "the rms amplitude errors were computed relative to the magnitude of the amplitude itself .",
    "the rms phase errors are absolute , so they are appropriately compared to the possible range of relative phases ( @xmath9 ) rather than to the measured phase .",
    "other approaches for quantifying errors are possible , but this approach seemed the most consistent way to compare errors across varied data sets .",
    "[ fig1 ]      five data sets with different frequencies and periods were generated in a spreadsheet as sums of cosine functions with defined frequencies , amplitudes , and phases .",

    "this is the high noise analog to the peak shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "the very low noise condition corresponds with the results of the cosine series data and transforms , and the `` very low noise '' is understood to arise from the double precision machine truncation error rather than explicitly added gaussian noise .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] indicates that reducing the step size from 1/10 the fft bin size to 1/100 the fft bin size reduces the relative rms frequency error under all three noise conditions , but that the reduction of error is smaller under high noise conditions .",
    "improved frequency accuracy for 100 frequency steps per bin was somewhat unexpected .",
    "after the fact , this can be interpreted as reasonable , because the derivative of frequency with respect to frequency is 1 , so reducing the step size by a factor of 10 reduces the error by almost a factor of 10 in the case of very low noise and by a factor of 3 in the case of low noise .",

    "results are shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "note that reducing the step size from 10 points under each peak to 100 points under each peak does not improve determination of the peak amplitude like it did for peak frequency .",
    "recalling error propagation and calculus , the reasons are clear .",
    "the error in one variable ( frequency ) propagates to another variable ( amplitude ) as proportional to the first derivative of amplitude with respect to frequency .",
    "but at a peak , the first derivative of amplitude with respect to frequency is zero , so that reducing the step size from 10 to 100 points under the peak does not reduce amplitude error in the same way it reduces frequency and phase error .",
    "[ fig11 ]    figure [ fig11 ] shows the effects of bin size and signal to noise ratio on rms phase error .",
    "reducing the step size to 100 times smaller than the fft bin yields much more accurate phase determination than the fft bin size or 10 times smaller for all noise conditions studied .",
    "as expected , phase errors increase as noise is increased .",

    "rms errors in frequency determination range from 5 times to 10 times higher when determining frequency by fft , 1.4 to 60 times higher when determining amplitude by fft , and 6 to 10 times higher when determining phase by fft .",
    "these errors may be lowered by applying appropriate interpolation techniques to the output of ffts ; however , interpolation techniques may also further reduce errors resulting from ei computation of fourier transforms .",
    "analyzing a data set with the explicit integration method will yield more accurate and dependable results than those analyzed with the fast fourier method .    since the ei method is significantly more accurate in all cases where known good values are available , it is reasonable to suggest that the difference between the ei and fft transforms provides a first order estimate of uncertainties of the fft method when known good values of frequency , amplitude , and phase are not independently available . in most cases ,",
    "the fft frequency uncertainty is a significant fraction of the reciprocal of the sampling time window , and much lower uncertainties are possible with the ei method .",
    "rms frequency errors for the fft method range from 8% to 29% of the reciprocal of the sampling time window .",
    "in contrast , rms errors for the ei method range from 0% to 6% of the reciprocal of the sampling time window .    one may also consider how frequency errors compare with the absolute frequency rather than the width of the peak in the frequency spectrum .",
    "( recall the width of resolved peaks in the frequency spectrum is the reciprocal of the sampling time window . ) with the ei method , relative uncertainties of 1 part in @xmath34 to 1 part in @xmath47 of the absolute frequency are realized with the test cases reported here .",
    "this level of accuracy is useful in some applications .",
    "for example , doppler methods determine velocities of signal sources ( or reflectors ) based on small frequency shifts . if the frequency shift is only 0.1% of the unshifted signal , an absolute frequency accuracy of 1 part in @xmath34 is needed to determine velocity to 1% . in other cases , such as",
    "atomic spectra and tides , high accuracy is useful for comparing experimentally determined frequencies with theoretical predictions .    amplitude differences ( rms ) between fft and ei methods range from 2% to 29% . without noise in the signal ,",
    "the ei method determined fourier amplitudes with an rms error 0.27% in the test cases studied .",
    "even with noise added that was larger than the fourier amplitudes , the ei method was capable of determining amplitudes with an rms error of 11% .",
    "many data sets of interest ( tides , ecgs , @xmath0 , temperatures ) have excellent signal to noise ratios .",
    "consequently , the ei method will likely be useful for accurately determining underlying fourier amplitudes .",
    "this may prove particularly useful in cases ( tides , @xmath0 , temperatures ) where accurate amplitudes are useful for identifying environmental changes or testing hypotheses regarding relationships between key environmental variables .",
    "for example , the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere should not only cause average temperatures to rise , it should also decrease the amplitude of the diurnal temperature oscillation due to reduced radiative cooling at night .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes of the annual and bi - annual peaks in the fourier transform of @xmath0 concentration are related to the environment s ability to absorb atmospheric @xmath0 into the biomass through photosynthetic processes .",
    "it is widely known that fft methods provide poor phase accuracy ( biancacci , 2011 ) .",
    "the cases studied here confirm that , with most rms phase differences between fft and ei methods being a significant fraction of @xmath48 .",
    "the case studies with known good phases show that the ei method can determine phases with an absolute rms accuracy of 0.086 radians without noise and under low noise conditions and 0.14 radians in cases where the noise exceeds the signal .",
    "accurate determination of phase allows accurate determination of the timing of maxima and minima in the time domain even when noise or sampling rate do not provide obvious times of these events in the original data series .",
    "for example , the phase of the oscillations in @xmath0 concentrations can be used to determine the time of the peak within 5 days or so , even though samples are only available every 30 days .",
    "changing phase shifts over time in @xmath0 concentrations indicate an earlier or later annual peak which may be related to changes in @xmath0 emissions or environmental processes ( photosynthetic cycling of @xmath0 into the biomass and release through decay ) .",
    "the phase of diurnal temperature changes provides a way to quantify the delay between the peak of radiative heating ( solar noon ) and the peak temperature , which is determined in large part by greenhouse slowing of radiative cooling .",
    "padding an original data set with zeros is one technique that is commonly used to recover some advantages of the ei method while retaining some speed advantages of the fft method .",
    "for example , if a time series originally contained 1000 data points and yielded a step size in frequency of @xmath25 , one could add 9000 additional data points ( all zeros ) to the initial data set to produce a step size in frequency of @xmath49 and effectively mimic the results of applying the ei method to the original ( 1000 point ) data set with a frequency step size of @xmath49 . in cases where the whole ( nyquist limited ) frequency range is of interest , this can produce some time savings , because @xmath50 is smaller than @xmath51 for large data sets .",
    "care must be taken to apply any windowing function to the original data before padding with zeros .",
    "given the outstanding speed of modern computers to compute ei transforms , zero padding has several drawbacks . adding data to a measured time series that were not actually measured may reasonably violate the conscience of honest scientists .",
    "the analysis results may be identical , but scientists would do well to never add data during the analysis stages that was not actually measured .",
    "professor emeritus of physics edward zganjar of lsu once admonished a student ,  you must treat your data as a rabbi treats a torah . \"",
    "( private communication )    even scientists who realize that zero padding effectively interpolates between bins in ffts and is equivalent ( or nearly equivalent ) to computing a much slower ei transform of comparable bin size should realize the discomfort a student may have padding a decade of @xmath0 concentration data with zeroes for an additional 90 years , resulting in a 100 year data set of which only the first decade represents actual measurements .",
    "teachers may be similarly uncomfortable instructing students to pad data sets in this manner , recognizing that significant scientific maturity is required to distinguish the rare cases ( such as zero padding ) where adding or subtracting data from a measured data set is a legitimate and recognized technique from the multitude of cases where adding or subtracting data from a measured data set is more likely to be considered fraudulent .",
    "furthermore , in cases where only 1 peak ( or a few peaks ) is of interest and the scientist wants 10 frequency steps under the peak , the execution time for the ei method can be reduced to being proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of data points in the original time series . in cases where @xmath54 peaks are of interest , the execution time for the ei method can require as few as @xmath55 operations .",
    "for example , if one were interested in the amplitudes and phases of @xmath56 tidal resonances , the execution time for the ei method could be as small as @xmath57 ; whereas , obtaining the same result from zero padding requires execution time proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "further , because zero padding requires creation of a much larger data set than the original time series , it uses much more computer memory .",
    "the largest data set in the cases above contained 500,000 data points . the zero padded data set required for comparable output would contain 5 million data points ,",
    "so there is a trade - off between computer speed and memory usage .",
    "it might also be noted that due to cache sizes , the speed of computer operations decreases rapidly for ffts on data sets with over 10,000 points.@xcite    it is widely recognized @xcite that a numerical limitation of fourier transform is related to accurately computing required values of the trigonometric functions .",
    "it is further recognized that the number and order of operations in most fft implementations tends to reduce the manner in which numerical rounding errors propagate to the final result compared with ei methods .",
    "if the trigonometric values are computed with sufficient accuracy , the propagation of numerical rounding errors is the limiting factor of accuracy for amplitudes and phases that are returned by both fft and ei methods .",
    "one can envision a numerical experiment extending the present work in which the inherent numerical rounding errors of the two methods are compared by computing fft and ei transforms of known cosine series ( with and without random noise added ) in cases where the length of the data sets are chosen to guarantee bins ( frequency samples ) exactly under each frequency in the cosine series .",
    "articulated hypotheses @xcite regarding whether errors will be @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or @xmath61 can be empirically tested in the various cases of interest , and error accumulation in both phase and amplitude results can be studied . in performing fourier analysis on data with measurement uncertainties ,",
    "it is generally believed that increasing the sample size results in more accurate determinations of important frequencies , amplitudes , and phases .",
    "however , the manner in which errors propagate in fourier methods likely sets an upper bound on the the brute force approach of increasing accuracy with ever increasing numbers of data points in the sample .",
    "fft based techniques exist for interpolating frequencies and improving phase determinations .",
    "these techniques are of greater interest in signal processing where speed is the big issue than in scientific data analysis .",
    "it seems that many signal processing programmers have failed to appreciate the needs of fourier analysis for scientific data analysis .",
    "many scientists are not programmers inclined to search the literature and implement the perfect fix to fft limitations to improve analysis accuracy .",
    "if the fft algorithm in excel , a digital oscilloscope , or a favorite graphing program is not accurate enough , they are not likely to look further than a google / scholar search to download something better .",
    "we have provided both a paper ( here ) and the code ( source and executable , https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/ ) that will provide more accurate frequency , amplitude , and phase all in one package and within the capabilities of most scientists and engineers who need to compute fourier transforms .",
    "scientists who are not in love with programming ( including the authors ) would rather solve a problem with a program that may take longer to run if their programming / debugging efforts are next to nothing ( compile and run , at most ) than spend time programming and debugging fft accuracy fixes .",
    "do the majority of scientists and engineers who are not expert programmers really care that there is some fft `` improvement '' out there somewhere that can overcome limitations and inaccuracies inherent in the fact that the fft bin size is the same as the width of a well resolved peak in the fourier transform ?",
    "these `` improvements '' are not used in widely available fft implementations and likely require coding and debugging efforts to add them to an existing fft implementation .",
    "explicit integration with a well - chosen bin size yields all the benefits of all the possible fft improvements ( frequency , amplitude , and phase ) is now available simply by downloading a windows executable or compiling a complete c program under mac or unix .    in summary",
    ", this project has shown the advantages of ei methods in fourier analysis by analyzing 136 peaks in 43 data sets including over 3,000,000 data points .",
    "the scope of applications for fourier analysis is much broader than the cases studied here .",
    "fft methods will likely continue to be the best choice for time sensitive applications like communications and real - time processing of audio and video in compression algorithms .",
    "scientific applications where accuracy is more important than speed should favor ei methods .",
    "ei methods also have the advantage of being able to easily handle data sets with unevenly spaced points without labor and time intensive manual pre - processing . on a 2011 lenovo thinkpad used in this study ,",
    "computing 10 ei points per fft bin on 10,000 point input takes 31 seconds .",
    "computing 100 ei points per fft bin takes 5 minutes .",
    "this is plenty fast enough for many scientific data analysis applications .",
