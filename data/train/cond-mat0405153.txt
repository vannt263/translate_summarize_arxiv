    "the introduction is divided into three parts : ( 1 ) _ physics _ , ( 2 ) _ applications _ , and ( 3 ) _ developments_. a brief outline of the physics behind the casimir effect is discussed in item ( 1 ) . in item",
    "( 2 ) , major impact of casimir effect on technology and science is outlined . in item ( 3 ) , the introduction of this investigation is concluded with a brief review of the past developments , followed by a brief outline of the organization of this investigation and its contributions to the physics .      when two electrically neutral , conducting plates are placed parallel to each other , our understanding from classical electrodynamics tells us that nothing should happen to these plates .",
    "the plates are assumed to be that made of perfect conductors for simplicity . in 1948 ,",
    "h. b. g. casimir and d. polder faced a similar problem in studying forces between polarizable neutral molecules in colloidal solutions .",
    "colloidal solutions are viscous materials , such as paint , that contain micron - sized particles in a liquid matrix . it had been thought that forces between such polarizable , neutral molecules were governed by the van der waals interaction . the van der waals interaction is also referred to as the `` lennard - jones interaction . ''",
    "it is a long range electrostatic interaction that acts to attract two nearby polarizable molecules .",
    "casimir and polder found to their surprise that there existed an attractive force which could not be ascribed to the van der waals theory .",
    "their experimental result could not be correctly explained unless the retardation effect was included in van der waals theory .",
    "this retarded van der waals interaction or lienard - wiechert dipole - dipole interaction @xcite is now known as the casimir - polder interaction @xcite .",
    "casimir , following this first work , elaborated on the casimir - polder interaction in predicting the existence of an attractive force between two electrically neutral , parallel plates of perfect conductors separated by a small gap @xcite .",
    "this alternative derivation of the casimir force is in terms of the difference between the zero - point energy in vacuum and the zero - point energy in the presence of boundaries .",
    "this force has been confirmed by experiments and the phenomenon is what is now known as the `` casimir effect . ''",
    "the force responsible for the attraction of two uncharged conducting plates is accordingly termed the `` casimir force . ''",
    "it was shown later that the casimir force could be both attractive or repulsive depending on the geometry and the material property of the conductors @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect is regarded as macroscopic manifestation of the retarded van der waals interaction between uncharged polarizable molecules ( or atoms ) .",
    "microscopically , the casimir effect is due to interactions between induced multipole moments , where the dipole term is the most dominant contributor if it is non - vanishing .",
    "therefore , the dipole interaction is exclusively referred to , unless otherwise explicitly stated , throughout this investigation .",
    "the induced dipole moments can be qualitatively explained by the concept of `` vacuum polarization '' in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the idea is that a photon , whether real or virtual , has a charged particle content .",
    "namely , the internal loop , illustrated in figure [ cap : vacuum - polarization ] , can be @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 or @xmath4 pairs , etc .",
    "its correctness have been born out from the precision measurements of lamb shift @xcite and photoproduction @xcite experiments over a vast range of energies . for the almost zero energy photons considered in the casimir effect ,",
    "these pairs last for a time interval @xmath5 consistent with that given by the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy imbalance and @xmath8 is the planck constant .",
    "these virtual charged particles can induce the requisite polarizability on the boundary of the dielectric ( or conducting ) plates which explained the casimir effect .",
    "however , the dipole strength is left as a free parameter in the calculations because it can not be readily calculated .",
    "its value can be determined from experiments .",
    "once this idea is taken for granted , one can then move forward to calculate the effective , temperature averaged , energy due to the dipole - dipole interactions with the time retardation effect folded in . the energy between the dielectric ( or conducting ) media is obtained from the allowed modes of electromagnetic waves determined by the maxwell equations together with the boundary conditions .",
    "the casimir force is then obtained by taking the negative gradient of the energy in space .",
    "this approach , as opposed to full atomistic treatment of the dielectrics ( or conductors ) , is justified as long as the most significant photon wavelengths determining the interaction are large when compared with the spacing of the lattice points in the media .",
    "the effect of all the multiple dipole scattering by atoms in the dielectric ( or conducting ) media simply enforces the macroscopic reflection laws of electromagnetic waves .",
    "for instance , in the case of the two parallel plates , the most significant wavelengths are those of the order of the plate gap distance .",
    "when this wavelength is large compared with the interatomic distances , the macroscopic electromagnetic theory can be used with impunity .",
    "the geometric configuration can introduce significant complications , which is the subject matter this study is going to address .    in order to handle the dipole - dipole interaction hamiltonian in this case",
    ", the classical electromagnetic fields have to be quantized into the photon representation first .",
    "the photon with non - zero occupation number have energies in units of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the planck constant divided by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the angular frequency .",
    "the lowest energy state of the electromagnetic fields has energy @xmath13 they are called the vacuum or the zero point energy state , and they play a major role in the casimir effect . throughout this investigation ,",
    "the terminology `` photon '' is used to represent the entity with energy @xmath14 or the entity with energy @xmath15 unless explicitly stated otherwise .      in order to appreciate the importance of the casimir effect from industry s point of view , we first examine the theoretical value for the attractive force between two uncharged conducting parallel plates separated by a gap of distance @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath19 is the plate gap distance . to get a sense of the magnitude of this force",
    ", two mirrors of an area of @xmath20 separated by a distance of @xmath21 would experience an attractive casimir force of roughly @xmath22 which is about the weight of a water droplet of half a millimeter in diameter .",
    "naturally , the scale of size plays a crucial role in the casimir effect . at a gap separation in the ranges of @xmath23 which is roughly about a hundred times the typical size of an atom",
    ", the equivalent casimir force would be in the range of @xmath24 atmospheric pressure .",
    "the casimir force have been verified by steven lamoreaux @xcite in 1996 to within an experimental uncertainty of @xmath25% .",
    "an independent verification of this force have been done by u. mohideen and anushree roy @xcite in 1998 to within an experimental uncertainty of @xmath24% .",
    "it is however emphasized that these experiments were not done exactly in the same context of casimir s original configuration due to technical difficulties associated with casimir s idealized perfectly flat surfaces . in 2002 , casimir s parallel plate configuration have been examined by g. bressi , g. carugno , r. onofrio , and g. ruoso @xcite .",
    "their force coefficient was measured at the 15% precision level .",
    "the importance of casimir effect is most significant for the miniaturization of modern electronics .",
    "the technology already in use that is affected by the casimir effect is that of the microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) .",
    "these are devices fabricated on the scale of microns and sub - micron sizes .",
    "the order of the magnitude of casimir force at such a small length scale can be enormous .",
    "it can cause mechanical malfunctions if the casimir force is not properly taken into account in the design , e.g. , mechanical parts of a structure could stick together , etc @xcite .",
    "the casimir force may someday be put to good use in other fields where nonlinearity is important .",
    "such potential applications requiring nonlinear phenomena have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the technology of mems hold many promising applications in science and engineering . with the mems",
    "soon to be replaced by the next generation of its kind , the nanoelectromechanical systems or nems , understanding the phenomenon of the casimir effect become even more crucial .    aside from the technology and engineering applications , the casimir effect plays a crucial role in accurate force measurements at nanometer and micrometer scales @xcite . as an example , if one wants to measure the gravitational force at a distance of atomic scale , not only the subtraction of the dominant coulomb force has to be done , but also the casimir force , assuming that there is no effect due to strong and weak interactions .",
    "most recently , a new casimir - like quantum phenomenon have been predicted by feigel @xcite .",
    "the contribution of vacuum fluctuations to the motion of dielectric liquids in crossed electric and magnetic fields could generate velocities of @xmath26 unlike the ordinary casimir effect where its contribution is solely due to low frequency vacuum modes , the new casimir - like phenomenon predicted recently by feigel is due to the contribution of high frequency vacuum modes .",
    "if this phenomenon is verified , it could be used in the future as an investigating tool for vacuum fluctuations .",
    "other possible applications of this new effect lie in fields of microfluidics or precise positioning of micro - objects such as cold atoms or molecules .",
    "everything that was said above dealt with only one aspect of the casimir effect , the attractive casimir force . in spite of many technical challenges in precision casimir force measurements @xcite ,",
    "the attractive casimir force is fairly well established .",
    "this aspect of the theory is not however what drives most of the researches in the field .",
    "the casimir effect also predicts a repulsive force and many researchers in the field today are focusing on this phenomenon yet to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest that for certain geometric configurations , two neutral conductors would exhibit repulsive behavior rather than being attractive .",
    "the classic result that started all this is due to boyer s work on the casimir force calculation for an uncharged spherical conducting shell @xcite . for a spherical conductor ,",
    "the net electromagnetic radiation pressure , which constitute the casimir force , has a positive sign , thus being repulsive .",
    "this conclusion seems to violate fundamental principle of physics for the fields outside of the sphere take on continuum in allowed modes , where as the fields inside the sphere can only assume discrete wave modes .",
    "however , no one has been able to experimentally confirm this repulsive casimir force .",
    "the phenomenon of casimir effect is too broad , both in theory and in engineering applications , to be completely summarized here .",
    "i hope this informal brief survey of the phenomenon could motivate people interested in this remarkable area of quantum physics .",
    "casimir s result of attractive force between two uncharged , parallel conducting plates is thought to be a remarkable application of qed .",
    "this attractive force have been confirmed experimentally to a great precision as mentioned earlier @xcite .",
    "casimir s attractive force result between two parallel plates has been unanimously thought to be obvious .",
    "its origin can also be attributed to the differences in vacuum - field energies between those inside and outside of the resonator . however , in 1968 , t. h. boyer , then at harvard working on his thesis on casimir effect for an uncharged spherical shell , had come to a conclusion that the casimir force was repulsive for his configuration , which was contrary to popular belief .",
    "his result is the well known repulsive casimir force prediction for an uncharged spherical shell of a perfect conductor @xcite .",
    "the surprising result of boyer s work has motivated many physicists , both in theory and experiment , to search for its evidence . on the theoretical side , people have tried different configurations , such as cylinders , cube , etc . , and found many more configurations that can give a repulsive casimir force @xcite .",
    "completely different methodologies were developed in striving to correctly explain the casimir effect .",
    "for example , the `` source theory '' was employed by schwinger for the explanation of the casimir effect @xcite . in spite of the success in finding many boundary geometries that gave rise to the repulsive casimir force ,",
    "the experimental evidence of a repulsive casimir effect is yet to be found .",
    "the lack of experimental evidence of a repulsive casimir force has triggered further examination of boyer s work .",
    "the physics and the techniques employed in the casimir force calculations are well established . the casimir force calculations involve summing up of the allowed modes of waves in the given resonator .",
    "this turned out to be one of the difficulties in casimir force calculations .",
    "for the casimir s original parallel plate configuration , the calculation was particularly simple due to the fact that zeroes of the sinusoidal modes are provided by a simple functional relationship , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wave number , @xmath19 is the plate gap distance and @xmath29 is a positive integer .",
    "this technique can be easily extended to other boundary geometries such as sphere , cylinder , cone or a cube , etc . for a sphere ,",
    "the functional relation that determines the allowed wave modes in the resonator is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius of the sphere ; and @xmath32 the @xmath33th root of the spherical bessel function @xmath34 the same convention is applied to all other bessel function solutions .",
    "the allowed wave modes of a cylindrical resonator is determined by a simple functional relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cylinder radius ; and @xmath37 the zeroes of cylindrical bessel functions @xmath38    one of the major difficulties in the casimir force calculation for nontrivial boundaries such as those considered in this investigation is in defining the functional relation that determines the allowed modes in a given resonator .",
    "for example , for the hemisphere - hemisphere boundary configuration , the radiation originating from one hemisphere would enter the other and run through a complex series of reflections before escaping the hemispherical cavity .",
    "the allowed vacuum - field modes in the resonator is then governed by a functional relation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the distance between two successive reflection points @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the resonator , as is illustrated in figure [ cap : cross - sectional - view - plate - and - hemisphere ] of section ( iii ) on reflection dynamics .",
    "as will be shown in the subsequent sections , the actual functional form for @xmath40 is not simple even though the physics behind @xmath40 is particularly simple : the application of the law of reflections .",
    "the task of obtaining the functional relation @xmath43 for the hemisphere - hemisphere , the plate - hemisphere , and the sphere configuration formed by bringing in two hemispheres together constitutes the major part of this investigation .",
    "this investigation is not about questioning the theoretical origin of the casimir effect . instead , its emphasis is on applying the casimir effect as already known to determine the sign of casimir force for the realistic experiments . in spite of a number of successes in the theoretical study of repulsive casimir force ,",
    "most of the configurations are unrealistic . in order to experimentally verify boyer s repulsive force for a charge - neutral spherical shell made of perfect conductor",
    ", one should consider the case where the sphere is formed by bringing in two hemispheres together .",
    "when the two hemispheres are closed , it mimics that of boyer s sphere .",
    "it is , however , shown later in this investigation that a configuration change from hemisphere - hemisphere to a sphere induces non - spherically symmetric energy flow that is not present in boyer s sphere .",
    "because boyer s sphere gives a repulsive casimir force , once those two closed hemispheres are released , they must repulse if boyer s prediction were correct .",
    "although the two hemisphere configuration have been studied for decades , no one has yet carried out its analytical calculation successfully .",
    "the analytical solutions on two hemispheres , existing so far , was done by considering the two hemispheres that were separated by an infinitesimal distance . in this investigation ,",
    "the consideration of two hemispheres is not limited to such infinitesimal separations .",
    "the three physical arrangements being studied in this investigation are : ( 1 ) the plate - hemisphere , ( 2 ) the hemisphere - hemisphere and ( 3 ) the sphere formed by brining in two hemispheres together .",
    "although there are many other boundary configurations that give repulsive casimir force , the configurations under consideration were chosen mainly because of the following reasons : ( 1 ) to be able to check experimentally the boyer s repulsive casimir force result for a spherical shell , ( 2 ) the experimental work involving configurations similar to that of the plate - hemisphere configuration is underway @xcite ; and ( 3 ) to the best of our knowledge , no detailed analytical study on these three configurations exists to date .",
    "the motivation behind to mathematically model the plate - hemisphere system came from the experiment done by a group at the bell laboratory @xcite in which they bring in an atomic - force - probe to a flopping plate to observe the casimir force which can affect the motion of the plate . in our derivations of the equations of motion ,",
    "the configuration is that of the `` plate displaced on upper side of a bowl ( hemisphere ) . ''",
    "the bell laboratory apparatus can be easily mimicked by simply displacing the plate to the under side of the bowl , which we have not done .",
    "the motivation behind the hemisphere - hemisphere system actually arose from an article by kenneth and nussinov @xcite . in their paper , they speculate on how the edges of the hemispheres may produce effects such that two arbitrarily close hemispheres can not mimic boyer s sphere .",
    "this led to their heuristic conclusion which stated that boyer s sphere can never be the same as the two arbitrarily close hemispheres .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , two of the geometrical configurations investigated in this work have not yet been investigated by others .",
    "they are the plate - hemisphere and the hemisphere - hemisphere configurations .",
    "this does not mean that these boundary configurations were not known to the researchers in the field , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for the case of the hemisphere - hemisphere configuration , people realized that it could be the best way to test for the existence of a repulsive casimir force for a sphere as predicted by boyer .",
    "the sphere configuration investigated in this work , which is formed by bringing two hemispheres together , contains non - spherically symmetric energy flows that are not present in boyer s sphere . in",
    "that regards , the treatment of the sphere geometry here is different from that of boyer .",
    "the basic layout of this investigation is as follows : ( 1 ) _ introduction _ , ( 2 ) _ theory _ , ( 3 ) _ calculations _ , and ( 4 ) _ results_. the formal introduction of the theory is addressed in chapters ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the original developments resulting from this investigation are contained in chapters ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "the brief outline of each chapter is the following : in chapter ( 1 ) , a brief introduction to the physics is addressed ; and the application importance and major developments in this field are discussed . in chapter",
    "( 2 ) , the formal aspect of the theory is addressed , which includes the detailed outline of the casimir - polder interaction and brief descriptions of various techniques that are currently used in casimir force calculations . in chapter ( 3 ) , the actual casimir force calculations pertaining to the boundary geometries considered in this investigation are derived . the important functional relation for @xmath40",
    "is developed here .",
    "the dynamical aspect of the casimir effect is also introduced here . due to the technical nature of the derivations ,",
    "many of the results presented are referred to the detailed derivations contained in the appendices . in chapter ( 4 ) , the results are summarized .",
    "lastly , the appendices have been added in order to accommodate the tedious and lengthy derivations to keep the text from losing focus due to mathematical details .",
    "the goal of this investigation is not to embark so much on the theory side of the casimir effect . instead",
    ", its emphasis is on bringing forth the suggestions that might be useful in detecting the repulsive casimir effect originally initiated by boyer on an uncharged spherical shell . in concluding this brief outline of the motivation behind this investigation",
    ", it must be added that if by any chance someone already did these work that have been claimed to be the original developments in this investigation , i was not aware of their work at the time of this work was being prepared . and , should that turn out to be the case , i would like to express my sincere apology for not referencing their work in this investigation .",
    "the casimir effect is divided into two major categories : ( 1 ) the electromagnetic casimir effect and ( 2 ) the fermionic casimir effect . as the titles suggest , the electromagnetic casimir effect is due to the fluctuations in a massless maxwell bosonic fields , whereas the fermionic casimir effect is due to the fluctuations in a massless dirac fermionic fields .",
    "the primary distinction between the two types of casimir effect is in the boundary conditions among other differences .",
    "the boundary conditions appropriate to the dirac equations are the so called `` bag - model '' boundary conditions , whereas the electromagnetic casimir effect follows the boundary conditions of the maxwell equations .",
    "the details of the fermionic force can be found in references @xcite .    in this investigation ,",
    "only the electromagnetic casimir effect is considered . as it is inherently an electromagnetic phenomenon ,",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to the maxwell equations , followed by the quantization of electromagnetic fields .",
    "there are four maxwell equations : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where the gaussian system of units have been adopted .",
    "the electric and the magnetic field are defined respectively by @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the scalar potential and @xmath51 is the vector potential . equations ( [ eq : maxwell - e - equations-1 ] ) through ( [ eq : maxwell - b - equations-4 ] ) are combined to give @xmath52\\right.\\\\ \\left.+\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\epsilon_{lmn}\\partial_{m}j_{n}+\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\partial_{t}^{2}\\left[\\partial_{l}\\phi+\\frac{1}{c}\\partial_{t}a_{l}\\right]+\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\epsilon_{ljk}\\partial_{j}\\partial_{t}^{2}a_{k}\\right\\ } \\hat{e_{l } } & = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the einstein summation convention is assumed for repeated indices .",
    "because the components along basis direction @xmath53 are independent of each other , the above vector algebraic relation becomes three equations : @xmath54\\nonumber \\\\",

    "unfortunately , they are in general too complicated to solve exactly .",
    "the need to choose an appropriate gauge to approximately solve the above equations is not only an option , it is a must .",
    "also , for what is concerned with the vacuum - fields , that is , the radiation from matter when it is in its lowest energy state , information about the charge density @xmath56 and the current density @xmath57 must be first prescribed .",
    "unfortunately , to describe properly the charge and current densities of matter is a major difficulty in its own .",
    "therefore , the charge density @xmath56 and the current density @xmath57 are set to be zero for the sake of simplicity and the coulomb gauge , @xmath58 is adopted . under these conditions , equation ( [ eq : maxwell - a - equations ] ) is simplified to @xmath59 the steady state monochromatic solution is then of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the solution of the temporal differential equation satisfying @xmath64 with the solution @xmath65 the electric and the magnetic fields are found to be @xmath66\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 the electromagnetic field hamiltonian becomes : @xmath68dv\\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{k^{2}}{2\\pi}\\left\\vert \\alpha\\left(t\\right)\\right\\vert ^{2},\\label{eq : field - kamiltonian - classical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a wave number , and @xmath61 have been normalized such that @xmath69    we can transform @xmath70 into the `` normal coordinate representation '' through the introduction of `` creation '' and `` annihilation '' operators , @xmath71 and @xmath72 the resulting field hamiltonian @xmath70 of equation ( [ eq : field - kamiltonian - classical ] ) is identical in form to that of the canonically transformed simple harmonic oscillator , @xmath73 for the free electromagnetic field hamiltonian , the canonical transformation is to follow the sequence @xmath74 under a properly chosen generating function .",
    "the result is that with the following physical quantities , @xmath75 , &   & p\\left(t\\right)=\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}}\\left[\\alpha\\left(t\\right)+\\alpha^{*}\\left(t\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free field hamiltonian of equation ( [ eq : field - kamiltonian - classical ] ) becomes @xmath76,\\label{eq : field - hamiltonian - classical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is identical to the hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "then , through a direct comparison and observation with the usual simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian in quantum mechanics , the following replacements are made @xmath77 and , the quantized relations for @xmath65 @xmath78 and @xmath79 are found , @xmath80,\\label{eq : monochromatic - a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath81,\\label{eq : monochromatic - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath82,\\label{eq : monochromatic - b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is understood that @xmath65 @xmath78 and @xmath79 are now quantum mechanical operators .",

    "for the rest of this investigation , `` boyer s sphere '' would be strictly referred to as the sphere made of material with such a property that it only radiates or responds to vacuum - field radiations at normal angle of incidence with respect to its surface .",
    "the formation of a sphere by bringing together two nearby hemispheres satisfying the material property of boyer s sphere is illustrated in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - hemi - to - sphere ] . since",
    "boyer s material property only allow radiation in the normal direction to its surface , the radiation associated with each hemisphere would necessarily go through the corresponding hemisphere centers . for clarity , let us define the unit radial basis vector associated with the left and right hemispheres by @xmath609 and @xmath610 respectively . if the hemispheres are made of normal conductors the radiation from one hemisphere entering the other hemisphere cavity would go through a complex series of reflections before escaping the cavity . here",
    ", a conductor with boyer s stringent material property is not considered normal .",
    "conductors that are normal also radiate in directions non - normal to their surface , whereas boyer s conductor can only radiate normal to its surface . due to the fact that boyer s conducting materials can only respond to radiation impinging at a normal angle of incidence with respect to its surface ,",
    "all of the incoming radiation at oblique angles of incidence with respect to the local surface normal is absorbed by the host hemisphere .",
    "this suggests that for the hemisphere - hemisphere arrangement made of boyer s material shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - hemi - to - sphere ] , the temperature of the two hemispheres would rise indefinitely over time",
    ". this does not happen with ordinary conductors .",
    "this suggests that boyer s conducting material , of which his sphere is made , is completely hypothetical . precisely because of this material assumption",
    ", boyer s casimir force is repulsive .    for the moment ,",
    "let us relax the stringent boyer s material property for the hemispheres to that of ordinary conductors .",
    "for the hemispheres made of ordinary conducting materials , there would result a series of reflections in one hemisphere cavity due to those radiations entering the cavity from nearby hemisphere . for simplicity ,",
    "the ordinary conducting material referred to here is that of perfect conductors without boyer s hypothetical material property requirement .",
    "furthermore , only the radiation emanating normally with respect to its surface is considered .",
    "the idea is to illustrate that the `` normally emanated radiation '' from one hemisphere results in elaboration of the effects of `` obliquely emanated radiation '' on another hemisphere cavity . here",
    "the obliquely emanated radiation means those radiation emanating from a surface not along the local normal of the surface .    when two such hemispheres are brought together to form a sphere ,",
    "there would exist some radiation trapped in the sphere of which the radiation energy flow lines are not spherically symmetric with respect to the sphere center . to see how a mere change in configuration invokes such non - spherically symmetric energy flow ,",
    "consider the illustration shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - config - demo ] .",
    "for clarity , only one `` normally emanated radiation '' energy flow line from the left hemisphere is shown .",
    "when one brings together the two hemispheres just in time before that quantum of energy escapes the hemisphere cavity to the right , the trapped energy quantum would continuously go through series of complex reflections in the cavity obeying the reflection law .",
    "but how fast or how slow one brings in two hemispheres is irrelevant in invoking such non - spherically symmetric energy flow because the gap @xmath611 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "therefore , there would always be a stream of energy quanta crossing the hemisphere opening with @xmath612 as shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - config - demo ] .",
    "in other words , there is always a time interval @xmath5 within which the hemispheres are separated by an amount @xmath611 before closure .",
    "the quanta of vacuum - field radiation energy created within that time interval @xmath5 would always be satisfying the condition @xmath613 and this results in reflections at oblique angle of incidence with respect to the local normal of the walls of inner sphere cavity .",
    "only when the two hemispheres are finally closed , would then @xmath614 and the radiation energy produced in the sphere after that moment would be spherically symmetric and the reflections would be normal to the surface . however , those trapped quantum of energy that were produced prior to the closure of the two hemispheres would always be reflecting from the inner sphere surface at oblique angles of incidence .    unlike boyer s ideal laboratory , realistic laboratories have boundaries made of ordinary material as illustrated in figure [ cap : reallab ] .",
    "one must then take into account , when calculating the casimir force , the vacuum - field radiation pressure contributions from the involved conductors , as well as those contributions from the boundaries such as laboratory walls , etc .",
    "we will examine the physics of placing two hemispheres inside the laboratory .",
    "for simplicity , the boundaries of the laboratory as shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - reallab ] are assumed to be simple cubical . normally , the dimension of conductors considered in casimir force experiment is in the ranges of microns .",
    "when this is compared with the size of the laboratory boundaries such as the walls , the walls of the laboratory can be treated as a set of infinite parallel plates and the vacuum - fields inside the the laboratory can be treated as simple plane waves with impunity .",
    "the presence of laboratory boundaries induce reflection of energy flow similar to that between the two parallel plate arrangement . when the two hemisphere arrangement shown in figure [ cap : boyers - sphere - in - universe - hemi - to - sphere ] is placed in such a laboratory , the result is to elaborate the radiation pressure contributions from obliquely incident radiations on external surfaces of the two hemispheres .",
    "if the two hemispheres are made of conducting material satisfying boyer s material property , the vacuum - field radiation impinging on hemisphere surfaces at oblique angles of incidence would cause heating of the hemispheres .",
    "it means that boyer s hemispheres placed in a realistic laboratory would continue to rise in temperature as a function of time .",
    "however , this does not happen with ordinary conductors .",
    "if the two hemispheres are made of ordinary perfect conducting materials , the reflections of radiation at oblique angles of incidence from the laboratory boundaries would elaborate on the radiation pressure acting on the external surfaces of two hemispheres at oblique angles of incidence . because boyer s sphere only radiates in the normal direction to its surface , or only responds to impinging radiation at normal incidence with respect to the sphere surface , the extra vacuum - field radiation pressures considered here , i.e. , the ones involving oblique angles of incidence , are missing in his casimir force calculation for the sphere .",
    "t. h. boyer in 1968 have shown that for a charge - neutral , perfect conductor of hollow spherical shell , the sign of the casimir force is positive , which means the force is repulsive .",
    "he reached this conclusion by assuming that all vacuum - field radiation energy flows for his sphere are spherically symmetric with respect to its center .",
    "in other words , only the wave vectors that are perpendicular to his sphere surface were included in the casimir force calculation . in the following sections ,",
    "the non - perpendicular wave vector contributions to the casimir force that were not accounted for in boyer s work are considered .",

    ", the casimir effect can be thought of as a macroscopic manifestation of the retarded van der waals interaction . and",
    "the casimir force can be equivalently approximated by a summation of the constituent molecular forces employing casimir - polder interaction .",
    "this practice inherently relies on the material properties of the involved conductors through the use of polarizability parameters . in this respect",

    "boyer s material property is such that the atoms in his conducting sphere are arranged in such manner to respond only to the impinging radiation at local normal angle of incidence to the sphere surface , and they also radiate only along the direction of local normal to its surface . when the casimir force is calculated for a sphere made of boyer s fictitious material ,",
    "the force is repulsive .",
    "also , in boyer s original work , the laboratory boundary did not exist . when boyer s sphere is placed in a realistic laboratory ,",
    "the net casimir force acting on his sphere becomes attractive because the majority of the radiation from the laboratory boundaries acts to apply inward pressure on the external surface of sphere when the angle of incidence is oblique with respect to the local normal .",
    "if the sphere is made of ordinary perfect conductors , the impinging radiation at oblique angles of incidence would be reflected . in such cases",
    "the total radiation pressure applied to the external local - sphere - surface is twice the pressure exerted by the incident wave , which is the force found in equation ( [ eq : sphere - ambient - force - average - total ] ) of the previous section .",
    "however , boyer s sphere can not radiate along the direction that is not normal to the local - sphere - surface .",
    "therefore , the total pressure applied to boyer s sphere is half of the force given in equation ( [ eq : sphere - ambient - force - average - total ] ) of the previous section .",
    "this peculiar incapability of emission of a boyer s sphere would lead to the absorption of the energy and would cause a rise in the temperature for the sphere .",
    "nonetheless , the extra pressure due to the waves of oblique angle of incidence is large enough to change the casimir force for boyer s sphere from being repulsive to attractive .",
    "the presence of the laboratory boundaries only act to enhance the attractive aspect of the casimir force on a sphere .",
    "the fact that boyer s sphere can not irradiate along the direction that is not normal to the local - sphere - surface , whereas ordinary perfect conductors irradiate in all directions , implies that his sphere is made of extraordinarily hypothetical material , and this may be the reason why the repulsive casimir force have not been experimentally observed to date .    in conclusion , ( 1 )",
    "the casimir force is both boundary and material property dependent .",
    "the particular shape of the conductor , e.g. sphere , only introduces the preferred direction for radiation .",
    "for example , radiations in direction normal to the local surface has bigger magnitude than those radiating in other directions .",
    "this preference for the direction of radiation is intrinsically connected to the preferred directions for the lattice vibrations . and",
    ", the characteristic of lattice vibrations is intrinsically connected to the property of material .",
    "( 2 ) boyer s sphere is made of extraordinary conducting material , which is why his casimir force is repulsive .",
    "( 3 ) when the radiation pressures of all angles of incidence are included in the casimir force calculation , the force is attractive for a charge - neutral sphere made of ordinary perfect conductor .",
    "the first step in detecting the repulsive casimir force for a spherical configuration is to find a conducting material that most closely resembles the boyer s material to construct two hemispheres .",
    "it has been discussed previously that even boyer s sphere can produce attractive casimir force when the radiation pressures due to oblique incidence waves are included in the calculation .",
    "therefore , the geometry of the laboratory boundaries have to be chosen to deflect away as much as possible the oblique incident wave as illustrated in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] .",
    "once these conditions are met , the experiment can be conducted in the region labeled `` apparatus region '' to observe boyer s repulsive force .",
    "the casimir effect has influence in broad range of physics . here",
    ", we list one such phenomenon known as `` sonoluminescense , '' and , finally conclude with the casimir oscillator .",
    "the phenomenon of sonoluminescense remains a poorly understood subject to date @xcite .",
    "when a small air bubble of radius @xmath665 is injected into water and subjected to a strong acoustic field of @xmath666 under pressure roughly @xmath667 the bubble emits an intense flash of light in the optical range , with total energy of roughly @xmath668 this emission of light occurs at minimum bubble radius of roughly @xmath669 the flash duration has been determined to be on the order of @xmath670 @xcite .",
    "it is to be emphasized that small amounts of noble gases are necessary in the bubble for sonoluminescense .",
    "the bubble in sonoluminescense experiment can be thought of as a deformed sphere under strong acoustic pressure .",
    "the dynamical casimir effect arises due to the deformation of the shape ; therefore , introducing a modification to @xmath671 from that of the original bubble shape . here",
    "@xmath672 is the path length for the reflecting wave in the original bubble shape . in general @xmath673 from the relations found in this work for the reflection points @xmath674 and @xmath675 together with the dynamical casimir force expression of equation ( [ eq : dynamical - force - l - dot - only-3d - na ] )",
    ", the amount of initial radiation energy converted into heat energy during the deformation process can be found .",
    "the bubble deformation process shown in figure [ cap : sonoluminescense ] is a three dimensional heat generation problem .",
    "current investigation seeks to determine if the temperature can be raised sufficiently to cause deuterium - tritium ( d - t ) fusion to occur , which could provide an alternative approach to achieve energy generation by this d - t reaction ( threshold @xmath676 ) @xcite .",
    "its theoretical treatment is similar to that discussed on the * 1d * problem shown in figure [ cap : casimir - plates - outlook ] .",
    "if one can create a laboratory as shown in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] , and place in the laboratory hemispheres made of boyer s material , then the hemisphere - hemisphere system will execute an oscillatory motion .",
    "when two such hemispheres are separated , the allowed wave modes in the hemisphere - hemisphere confinement would no longer follow boyer s spherical bessel function restriction .",
    "instead it will be strictly constrained by the functional relation of @xmath677 where @xmath169 and @xmath678 are two neighboring reflection points .",
    "only when the two hemispheres are closed , would the allowed wave modes obey boyer s spherical bessel function restriction .    assuming that hemispheres are made of boyer s material and the laboratory environment",
    "is that shown in figure [ cap : casimir - effect - test - lab ] , the two closed hemispheres would be repulsing because boyer s casimir force is repulsive .",
    "once the two hemispheres are separated , the allowed wave modes are governed by the internal reflections at oblique angle of incidence .",
    "since the hemispheres made of boyer s material are `` infinitely unresponsive '' to oblique incidence waves , all these temporary non - spherical symmetric waves would be absorbed by the boyer s hemispheres and the hemispheres would heat up .",
