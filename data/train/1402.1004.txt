    "the evaluation of integral transforms of special functions is required in different areas of engineering .",
    "this problem arises when solving various analysis and design tasks such as assessment of average performance metrics . in some practical applications , integral transforms of the marcum q and bessel",
    "i functions occur . in communication engineering ,",
    "these functions appear in statistical models of fading radio channels , see , for example , [ 1]-[4 ] .",
    "the marcum q function arises also in different tasks of signal detection in additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) [ 4]-[8 ] .",
    "both functions are available via standard software packages such as _ mathematica _ , but nowadays analytical results on integral transforms of these special functions are not widely presented in the literature , and only some special cases have been reported .",
    "a large number of integrals involving the marcum q function of first order is presented in@xcite .    due to the modern software ,",
    "even infinite - range integrals often can be evaluated numerically .",
    "but it is well known that this process may be accompanied by numerical problems . therefore , it is convenient to have closed - form expressions , which additionally can be useful at the design stage since they allow analyzing of effects of various system parameters on performance metrics",
    ". furthermore , closed - form expressions are useful for solving various optimization tasks .    the product of bessel i and power functions occurs in the probability density function ( pdf ) of the @xmath0-@xmath1 generalized fading distribution recently introduced by m .-",
    "d . yacoub for modeling propagation effects in a non - homogeneous line - of - sight environment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution is also known as the generalized rician distribution [ 9]-[10 ] .",
    "analyzing this fading distribution , we reveal that the same integral expressed as the laplace transform of product of marcum q , bessel i , and power functions occurs in a few practical tasks related to the performance assessment of communication systems over @xmath0-@xmath1 fading",
    ". such are evaluation of probability of energy detection of unknown signals as well as assessment of outage probability in @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath1 interference - limited scenarios .",
    "as far as we aware , both tasks have not been yet solved analytically .    the detection probability over @xmath0-@xmath1 fading was evaluated so far by applying series expansions of marcum q and bessel i functions [ 11]-[12 ] .",
    "these procedures resulted in formulas given in terms of infinite series @xcite that can be expressed in terms of multivariate hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "the hypergeometric functions required for the evaluation are not nowadays available via the standard software .    considering the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading channels with @xmath0-@xmath1faded co - channel interference ,",

    ", we evaluate the laplace transform ( @xmath4 ) of the product of the generalized marcum q , bessel i , and power functions .",
    "more precisely , we solve the integral of the form    c [ int1 ] ( , , c , p,_1,_2)=\\{q__1(,)t^i__2 -1(c),\\{t , p } } + = _",

    "we use the derived results be used for the evaluation of outage probability over interference - limited @xmath0-@xmath1 fading radio channels with @xmath0-@xmath1faded co - channel interference .",
    "we also apply the obtained formulas to assess the detection probability of unknown signals in @xmath0-@xmath1 fading .",
    "in this section , we introduce concepts and special functions used in this work .      the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading signal is considered as the composition of clusters of multipath waves with the uncorrelated gaussian in - phase ( i ) and quadrature ( q ) components within each cluster , and the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath16 of the @xmath0-@xmath1 power variable @xmath17 is given in @xcite as    c f__-(x)= ( - ) i_-1(2 )    where @xmath18 is the ratio of the total power of the dominant components to that of the scattered waves , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the expectation and variance , respectively ) characterizes the number of multipath clusters .",
    "three parameters of the distribution provide a better fit to experimental data than do the commonly used fading models .",
    "as it is pointed out in @xcite , a fitting procedure may result in non - integer values of @xmath1 that can be caused by a few factors such as the non - gaussian distribution of the i and q components , non - zero correlation between the i and q components , or non - zero correlation between the multipath clusters .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution is a generalized fading model that includes many well - known fading distributions as particular cases .",
