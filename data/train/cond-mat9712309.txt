    "the dynamics of magnetization reversal in simple ferromagnetic systems has recently attracted considerable scientific interest to study the _ nonequilibrium _ responses . in this regard ,",
    "the dynamical responses of the ising system in presence of an oscillating magnetic field have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the dynamical hysteretic response @xcite and the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transition @xcite are two main subjects of interest to study the dynamic responses of the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field .    tome and oliviera @xcite first studied the dynamic transition by solving the mean field ( mf ) dynamic equation of motion ( for the average magnetisation ) of the kinetic ising model in presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field . by defining the order parameter",
    "as the time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field , they showed that the order parameter vanishes depending upon the value of the temperature and the amplitude of the oscillating field . in the field amplitude and temperature plane",
    "they have drawn a phase boundary separating dynamic ordered ( nonzero value of order parameter ) and disordered ( order parameter vanishes ) phase .",
    "they @xcite have also observed and located a _",
    "tricritical point _",
    "( tcp ) , ( separating the nature ( discontinuous / continuous ) of the transition ) on the phase boundary line .",
    "since , this transition exists even in the static ( zero frequency ) limit such a transition , observed @xcite from the solution of mean field dynamical equation , can not be dynamic in true sense .",
    "this is because , for the field amplitude less than the coercive field ( at temperature less than the static ferro - para transition temperature ) , the response magnetisation varies periodically but asymmetrically even in the zero frequency limit ; the system remains locked to one well of the free energy and can not go to the other one , in the absence of noise or fluctuation . on the other hand , in presence of thermal fluctuations , in the static limit",
    ", the system can go from one well to another via the formation of nucleating droplets .",
    "vanishingly small field is required to push the system from one to other well .",
    "consequently , the dynamic phase boundary collapses , in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "to study the true dynamic phase transition ( which should disappear in the static limit ) one has to consider the effect of thermal fluctuations . in this",
    "regard , lo and pelcovits @xcite first attempted to study the dynamic nature of this phase transition ( incorporating the effect of fluctuation ) in the kinetic ising model by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "however , they @xcite have not reported any precise phase boundary .",
    "acharyya and chakrabarti @xcite studied the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of oscillating magnetic field by extensive mc simulation .",
    "they @xcite have drawn the phase boundary and located a tricritical point ( as observed ) on the boundary .",
    "it has been also observed @xcite that this dynamic phase transition is associated with the breaking of the symmetry of the dynamic hysteresis ( @xmath0 ) loop . in the dynamically disordered ( value of order parameter vanishes ) phase the corresponding hysteresis loop is symmetric , and loses its symmetry in the ordered phase ( giving nonzero value of dynamic order parameter ) .",
    "they have @xcite also studied the temperature variation of the ac susceptibility components near the dynamic transition point .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the imaginary or lossy ( real ) part of the ac susceptibility gives a peak ( dip ) near the dynamic transition point ( where the dynamic order parameter vanishes ) .",
    "it was concluded that this is a possible indication of the thermodynamic nature of this kind of nonequilibrium dynamical phase transition .",
    "the statistical distribution of dynamic order parameter has been studied by sides et al @xcite .",
    "the nature of the distribution changes ( from bimodal to unimodal ) near the dynamic transition point .",
    "they have also observed @xcite that the fluctuation of the hysteresis loop area grows and becomes considerably large as one approach the dynamic transition point .",
    "the relaxation behaviour , of the dynamic order parameter , near the transition point ( in the disordered phase ) , has been studied @xcite recently by mc simulation and solving meanfield dynamic equation .",
    "it has been observed that the relaxation is debye type and the relaxation time diverges near the transition point .",
    "the specific heat and the susceptibility also diverge @xcite near the transition point in a similar manner with that of fluctuations of order parameter and fluctuation of energy respectively .",
    "these observations @xcite ( divergences of fluctuations ) indirectly supports the earlier facts @xcite where the distribution of the dynamic order parameter becomes wider and the fluctuation of hysteresis loop area becomes considerably large near the transition point .",
    "recently the experimental evidence @xcite of dynamic transition has been found .",
    "the dynamical symmetry breaking ( associated to the dynamic transition ) across the transition point of the hysteresis loop , has been observed , in highly anisotropic ( ising like ) and ultrathin co / cu(001 ) ferromagnetic films by surface magneto - optic kerr effect , as one passes through the transition point .",
    "the dynamical symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops has also been observed @xcite in ultrathin fe / w(110 ) film .",
    "however , the detailed natures of the dynamic transition and the phase boundary are not yet studied experimentally .    in this communication ,",
    "the dynamic phase transition has been studied in the kinetic ising model in presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field by mc simulation and by solving the mean field dynamical equation of motion for the average magnetization .",
    "the temperature variations of the hysteresis loss ( or loop area ) , the dynamic correlation and the phase lag are studied near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the paper has been organised as follows : in section ii simple analytic forms are given for the loop area , dynamic correlation and dynamic order parameter .",
    "in section iii a general relationship has been developed among the various dynamical quantities . in section",
    "iv the models are introduced and in section v the numerical results are given .",
    "the paper ends with a summary of the work in section vi .",
    "the form of the oscillating magnetic field is @xmath1    the dynamic order parameter is defined as @xmath2 which is nothing but the time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field .",
    "the hysteresis loop area is @xmath3 which corresponds the energy loss due to the hysteresis .",
    "the dynamic correlation is defined as @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the time average over the full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field . since @xmath6 = 0",
    ", one can write    @xmath7    the dynamic correlation has another physical interpretation . for the cooperatively interacting spin system ,",
    "this is the negative of the time averaged spin - field interaction energy ( per spin ) ( @xmath8 ) over a complete cycle of the oscillating field .    in the dynamically disordered ( @xmath9 ) phase and near the transition point , the time series of the magnetisation ( @xmath10 ) can be approximated as a square wave with a phase lag @xmath11 with the applied sinusoidal magnetic field .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 is the time period of the oscillating field and @xmath11 is the phase lag between magnetisation @xmath10 and the magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the hysteresis loop area can easily be calculated as @xmath15 this form of the loop area was also obtained @xcite from the assumption that it is approximately equal to four times the product of coercive field and remanent magnetization ( here the remanent magnetisation equal to unity ) , where the coercive field is identified as @xmath16 ( the change in field during the phase lag ) .",
    "considering the same form of the magnetisation the dynamic correlation @xmath17 can also be calculated exactly as @xmath18    from the above forms of @xmath19 and @xmath17 it can be written as @xmath20 the above relation tells that the loop area @xmath19 and the dynamic correlation @xmath17 is elliptically related to each other .",
    "it may be noted here , that the previously studied ac susceptibility components @xcite obey a circular relationship ( @xmath21 = @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the amplitude of the magnetization .    the ordered region ( @xmath24 ) can be approximated by considering the following form of the magnetization    @xmath25    in the above simplified approximation , it was considered that the magnetisation can not jump to the other",
    "well , however the value of initial magnetisation is reduced by the amount @xmath26 . in the real situation",
    "it has been observed that this well is not fully square ( as assumed above in the form of @xmath10 ) , it has a cusp like ( or parabolic ) shape . for @xmath26",
    "= 2 , the above functional form of @xmath10 will take the form of [ dis ] and one can get the disordered ( @xmath27 ) phase . taking the above form of magnetisation the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 can be calculated as @xmath29 . it may be noted that , in this simplified approximation the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 is independent of phase lag @xmath11 , which is not observed in the real situation ( phase lag shows a peak at the transition point ) . however , this simple picture can anticipate the convex ( looking from the origin ) nature @xcite of the dynamic phase boundary . as the temperature increases @xmath26 increases and it also increases as the field amplitude increases . in the simplest asumption , one can consider @xmath26 is proportional to the product of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "demanding , @xmath32 for the dynamic transition ( @xmath9 ) , one can readily obtain @xmath33 = constant .",
    "this equation tells that the dynamic phase boundary will be convex .",
    "the convex nature of the phase boundary remains invariant even if one assumes that @xmath26 is any increasing function of both @xmath31 and @xmath30 ( for example , power law ; @xmath34 , in this particular case the equation of the dynamic phase boundary becomes @xmath35 = constant , it is easy to see that this gives the convex shape of the dynamic phase boundary ) .",
    "however , this very simple asumption can not describe the entire form of the phase boundary accurately , particularly near the end points ( @xmath36 = 0 and @xmath37 = 0 ) .",
    "from the usual definitions ( given in earlier section ) of @xmath17 and @xmath19 , one can write @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "so ,    @xmath40    and    @xmath41 .",

    "it has been observed that the steady response @xmath10 , to a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field ( @xmath46 ) , is periodic ( with phase lag @xmath11 ) and has the same periodicity ( @xmath47 ) of the field .",
    "so , one can write @xmath10 in a fourier series as @xmath48 from the usual definitions of @xmath28 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 , it is easy to see that    @xmath49 , @xmath50  and   @xmath51    so , one can write @xmath52 keeping only the first harmonic terms ( ignoring higher harmonics ) one can easily express the instantaneous magnetization as @xmath53 where the amplitude of magnetization is @xmath54^{1/2}$ ] and the phase lag is @xmath55 .",

    "100 mcss are required to form a complete loop ( or cycle ) , and 600 such loops were discarded .",

    "the phase lag @xmath11 ( between field and magnetization ) has been calculated by taking the difference between the positions of minimum of magnetization and the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "all values of @xmath89 , @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath17 for a particular temperature were obtained by averaging over 10 different random samples to obtain the smooth variation .",
    "1 demonstrates the dynamic transition ( with dynamic symmetry breaking ) and the related phemomena ( e.g. , temperature variations of @xmath19 , @xmath11 etc . ) at a glance . for a fixed field amplitude @xmath90",
    "the time variations of @xmath58 and @xmath10 are plotted for various temperatures in the pictures in left column and the corresponding @xmath0 loops are shown in the right column .",
    "for very low temperature ( topmost pictures of fig .",
    "1 ) , since no spin flip occurs ( within the time period ) the magnetization @xmath10 remains constant ( unity ) and consequently the @xmath0 loop is a straight line having zero loop area .",
    "the dynamic order parameter is unity .",
    "the concept of phase lag ( between @xmath10 and @xmath58 ) is not applicable here .",
    "obviously the dynamic correlation is zero .",
    "after slight increase of temperature ( pictures in the second row ) some small number of spin flips occurs ( within the time period ) . for some time , @xmath10 decreases from unity and again it becomes equal to unity .",
    "the phase lag is the frequency ( @xmath83 ) times the time difference between the positions of minimum of @xmath10 and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath0 loop encloses a finite but small area giving @xmath28 less than unity .",
    "the dynamic correlation starts to grow .",
    "as the temperature increases further the phase lag ( @xmath11 ) and the loop area @xmath19 increases ( pictures in the third row ) and the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 decreases .",
    "in all three cases , described so far , the asymmetric shapes of the @xmath0 loops are observed due to asymmetric time variation of the response magnetisation @xmath10 . the dynamic correlation decreases .",
    "as the temperature is very close to the dynamic transition temperature , ( fourth row ) , where the time variation of the response magnetisation is almost symmetric giving maximum values of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 loop is symmetric and the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 is almost zero .",
    "the dynamic correlation @xmath17 becomes negative and minimal .",
    "as one increases the temperaure further ( last row ) , the phase lag decreases , and the loop area decreases . the dynamic correlation starts to grow further .",
    "it may be noted here that the conventional hysteresis or @xmath0 loop is observed in this region of temperature .",
    "as the temperature increases further the dynamic correlation grows , shows a maxima or peak and then decreases .",
    "the loop area monotonically decreases .",
    "the dynamical phase transition , via the dynamical symmetry breaking of the hysteresis loops , has been observed in highly anisotropic and ultrathin ( 2d ising like ) ferromagnetic films ( co / cu(001 ) and fe / w(110 ) ) @xcite by using surface magneto optic kerr effect study at room temperature .",
    "in the recent experimental study @xcite in ultrathin fe / w(110 ) , the dynamical symmetry breaking of the hysteresis loop was nicely depicted in fig . 1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the temperature variations of @xmath28 , @xmath11 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 for two different values of field amplitudes @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in both the cases ,",
    "it has been observed that , near the dynamic transition point ( @xmath9 ) the phase lag gives a peak and the dynamic correlation @xmath17 gives a shallow dip .",
    "the dynamic correlation @xmath17 gives a smeared peak much above ( around @xmath91 ) the static ( ferro - para ) transition point ( @xmath92 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the hysteresis loop area @xmath19 shows a peak above the dynamic transition point .",
    "it is possible to explain these observations from very simple analytical results described above ( section ii ) .",
    "the phase lag @xmath11 becomes maximum near the dynamic transition point .",
    "so , according to the analytical formulation ( for @xmath17 and @xmath19 ) for a fixed value of the field amplitude as the temperature increases the loop area @xmath93 ) starts to increases as the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 starts to decrease and above the dynamic transition point ( complete spin reversal ) the loop area will be maximum and after that @xmath19 will start to decrease .",
    "similarly , the dynamic correlation @xmath17 will remain approximately equal to zero until a considerable amount of spin flip occurs and @xmath28 changes appreciably and then starts to increase .",
    "above and near the transition point , where the phase lag @xmath11 decreases as temperature increases and @xmath94 should start to increase . which has been observed indeed",
    ". however , near the transition point it gives a shallow dip , where the value of the dynamic correlation @xmath17 in minimum and negative .",
    "the phase lag @xmath11 should be less than or at most equal to @xmath95 .",
    "the field ( @xmath96 ) crosses zero first at the phase value @xmath95 and it becomes minimum ( maximum negative ) at the value of phase ( @xmath97 ) equal to @xmath98 .",
    "the response magnetisation , should change its sign ( cross zero ) within this period .",
    "this is true for @xmath99 limit , however for finite but sufficiently high frequency , this will not happen .",
    "the phase difference more than @xmath95 would be observed yielding the unconventional shapes of @xmath0 or hysteresis loops . in practice , it was observed that some asymmetric shape of the ( @xmath0 ) loop gives the value of phase lag @xmath11 slightly higher than @xmath95 . in this region , @xmath100 , which is negative and",
    "will show a shallow dip ( cusp like shape ) at the point where @xmath11 is maximum . according , to the analytical prediction ,",
    "the loop area @xmath101 should show maximum at the transition point .",
    "however , strictly speaking and in practice it has been observed that the loop area @xmath19 becomes peaked above the transition temperature . since the loop area is much more strongly dependent on the actual shape of the magnetisation ( which is not a perfect square wave in the temperature range concerned here ) .",
    "as the field amplitude increases the transition points shift towards the lower temperature .",
    "the maximum of @xmath11 also increases and consequently the dip of @xmath17 becomes deeper and it remains negative over wider range of temperature ( since @xmath11 remains larger than @xmath95 over wider range ) .",
    "it may be noted that the dynamic correlation @xmath17 becomes zero ( in the disordered or @xmath28 = 0 region ) where the phase lag @xmath102 .",
    "the dynamic correlation @xmath17 shows a smeared peak at quite higher temperature ( above the onsager value ) , which was misinterpreted @xcite as a signature of the _",
    "stochastic resonance_. in the mf study ( next section ) , it was shown that this is also present in the absence of fluctuations ( or stochasticity ) .",
    "a similar previous study @xcite , showed that the ac susceptibility components would give peak ( or dip ) near the transition point .",
    "in that case , the susceptibility components were calculated from the phase lag @xmath11 .",
    "the phase lag @xmath11 would show a peak at the transition point . as a consequence",
    "the susceptibility components would show peak ( or dip ) reflecting the behaviour of phase lag @xmath11 . however , in this case , the three measurements of phase lag @xmath11 , loop area @xmath19 and dynamic correlation @xmath17 are completely independent , and indicate the transition point separately .      by solving the above meanfield equation the @xmath0 or hysteresis loops were obtained .",
    "the dynamic order parameter @xmath88 is readily calculated . the loop area @xmath19 and the dynamic correlation @xmath17 have been calculated by using the above definitions .",
    "the phase lag ( between field and magnetization ) has been calculated by taking the difference between the minima positions of magnetization and the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "3 shows the temperature variations of @xmath28 , @xmath11 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 for two different values of field amplitudes @xmath30 . in both the cases ,",
    "it has been observed that , near the dynamic transition point ( @xmath9 ) the phase lag gives a peak and the dynamic correlation @xmath17 gives a shallow dip .",
    "the hysteretic loss @xmath19 gives peak above the transition ( dynamic ) point .",
    "the dynamic correlation @xmath17 gives a smeared peak much above ( around @xmath103 ) the static ( ferro - para ) transition point ( @xmath104 ) ( for a closer view see fig .",
    "this high temperature peak of the dynamic correlation was misinterpreted as a signature of _ stochastic resonance _",
    "this peak is indeed present in the case where the fluctuation is absent ( mf case ) .",
    "the appearance of this peak at higher temperature can be explained as follows : for much higher temperature the time variation of instantaneous magnetisation is no longer a square wave like and becomes almost sinusoidal with a phase lage @xmath11 . in a very simple view",
    ", it can be approximated as @xmath105 ( from eqn [ mt ] ; @xmath28 = 0 at very high temperature ) .",
    "the dynamic correlation becomes @xmath106 .",
    "where @xmath23 is the amplitude of the magnetisation which monotonically decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "the phase lag @xmath11 also monotonically decreases in the higher temperature .",
    "consequently @xmath107 increases and @xmath23 decreases as temperature increases .",
    "so , one would obviously expect a peak at a finite temperature ( high enough ) where the competition , between fall of @xmath23 and rise of @xmath107 with respect to the temperature @xmath31 , becomes comparable .",
    "no stochasticity is involved in it !",
    "the loop area @xmath19 also gives a peak above the transition point .",
    "due to the similar reason given in the earlier section the dynamic correlation @xmath17 gives a shallow dip near the transition point .",
    "the dynamical response of the kinetic ising model in presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field has been studied both by monte carlo simulation ( in two dimension ) and by solving the meanfield dynamical equation of motion for the average magnetization .    a general relationship among the hysteresis loop area @xmath19 , dynamic order parameter @xmath28 and the dynamic correlation @xmath17 has been developed ( eqn .",
    "[ gen ] ) .",
    "the time series of the magnetization can be decomposed in a fourior series and the constant term is identifed as the dynamic order parameter @xmath28 , the amplitudes of first harmonic terms are found to be related to the hysteretic loss ( for sine term ) and the dynamic correlation ( for cosine term ) ( eqn .",
    "[ mt0 ] ) .",
    "the dynamic order parameter , the loop area and the dynamic correlation have been calculated _ separately _ ( both from mc and mf study ) and studied as a function of temperature .",
    "it was observed ( in both cases ) that the dynamic correlation shows shallow ( negative ) dip near the transition point .",
    "the dynamic transition point has been identified as the the minimum - correlation point .",
    "the hysteretic loss @xmath19 becomes maximum above the dynamic transition point . in this sense ,",
    "the dynamic transition point is not the maximum lossy point .",
    "it may be noted that the earlier study @xcite of the ac susceptibility suggests that the dynamic transition point would be the maximum - lossy point , since the imaginary part ( or lossy- part ) of the ac or complex susceptibility also shows a peak near the dynamic transition point .",
    "however , there is a remarkable distinction from the present study . in the earlier study @xcite , the phase lag was calculated from the simulations and the ac susceptibility components",
    "were calculated from the phase lag .",
    "so , it is expected that the temperature variations of the phase lag will be reflected directly in the temperature variations of ac susceptibility components .",
    "but , in the present study the measurements of phase lag , dynamic correlation and the loop area are completely independent .",
    "this behaviour of the dynamic correlation is explained from a simple square wave like time variation of the instantaneous response magnetisation .",
    "the oversimplified asumption is incapable of explaining the peak position ( above the transition point ) of the hysteretic loss @xmath19 .",
    "however , this simple picture can qualitatively describe the nonmonotonic temperature variations of @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "the high temperature ( above the static critical point @xmath108 ) peak of the dynamic correlation was misinterpreted @xcite as a signature of the _",
    "stochastic resonance_. this was also discussed and an analytical form of the dynamic correlation was proposed to show that the high temperature peak of the dynamic correlation is present even in the absence of fluctuations ( or _ stochasticity _ ) .",
    "along with the dynamic correlation , the dynamic transition can be identified by various thermodynamic quantities like ac susceptibility @xcite , relaxation time @xcite , specific heat @xcite , susceptibility @xcite and the fluctuations of dynamic order parameter and energy @xcite .",
    "all these quantities indicate the thermodynamic natures of this kind of nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition by showing peak , dip or divergence near the transition point .",
    "the related phenomena of this kind of nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model are mostly based on observations and not yet analysed by using rigorous theoretical foundations of equilibrium statistical mechanics available so far .",
    "the experimental evidences @xcite are still in the primitive stage .",
    "experimentally , only the dynamic symmetry breaking of the hysteresis loops is observed near the transition point .",
    "however , the details study of the nature of the transition , the phase boundary and the associated phenomena ( described above ) has not yet done experimentally .",
