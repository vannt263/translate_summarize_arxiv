    "recently a number of authors have developed generalizations of the bosonization method to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this approach is most suitable in interacting fermi systems where the fourier transform of the interaction is dominated by momentum transfers small compared with the fermi momentum @xmath0 . in this case the single - particle green s function satisfies a non - trivial asymptotic ward - identity@xcite , which opens the way for a controlled summation of the entire perturbation series .",
    "bosonization is one possible ( and perhaps the most efficient ) way to explicitly carry out this summation .",
    "interactions that exhibit in fourier space a strong maximum or even a singularity for small momentum transfers are long - range in real space .",
    "the experimentally perhaps most relevant interaction of this type is the effective current - current interaction due to the coupling between fermions and transverse gauge fields .",
    "such a coupling appears in models for strongly correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "moreover , effective current - current interactions are also generated by fluctuations of the statistical gauge field in the chern - simons theory for quantum hall systems@xcite .",
    "in refs.@xcite the gauge field problem has been studied via higher - dimensional bosonization . however , this approach has been criticized@xcite , because higher - dimensional bosonization relies ( at least in its simplest form ) on the linearization of the energy dispersion at the fermi surface , and there exists evidence that in the gauge field problem the curvature of the fermi surface can not be neglected@xcite .",
    "an alternative non - perturbative approach , which does not rely on the linearization of the energy dispersion , is the eikonal method .",
    "this approach has been developed in the 60 s to obtain non - perturbative results for the single - particle green s function of field theories where the fermionic degrees of freedom are linearly coupled to another bosonic quantum field@xcite .",
    "more recently , khveshchenko and stamp@xcite have used this method to study the above mentioned gauge field problem in two dimensions .",
    "the strategy is to calculate first the green s function @xmath1 of the fermions for fixed configuration of the gauge field @xmath2 , and then average the result with respect to the effective gauge field action @xmath3 to obtain the translationally invariant fermionic green s function@xcite , @xmath4 . to leading order in the eikonal expansion the averaging involves a trivial gaussian integration , and gives rise to the usual debye - waller factor@xcite .",
    "the functional integral approach to bosonization@xcite follows precisely the same strategy : the fermionic two - body interaction is first decoupled via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation involving a space and time - dependent auxiliary field ; then the fermionic green s function is calculated for a fixed configuration of the auxiliary field , and finally the result is averaged with respect to an effective action @xmath5 . although the functional bosonization approach@xcite is formulated in euclidean ( i.e. imaginary ) time while the eikonal expansion is by construction a minkowski ( i.e. real ) time method , the similarity in both procedures suggests that , after proper analytic continuation , they should yield equivalent results for models with linearized energy dispersion . in the present paper we shall carefully examine this point , and show that in general this is not the case .",

    "the time - dependent contribution @xmath140 can not be directly compared with a corresponding term in eq.[eq : debyewaller ] .",
    "to examine possible discrepancies with bosonization , let us explicitly calculate @xmath141 for the spinless tomonaga - luttinger model@xcite with interaction parameters @xmath142 . in this case the patch index @xmath143 labels the two fermi points , and the dynamic structure factor is simply @xmath144 , with residue @xmath145 and collective mode @xmath146 . here",
    "@xmath147 is the relevant dimensionless coupling .",
    "( it is understood that in @xmath148 the vector @xmath149 has only one component . )",
    "it is also easy to show@xcite that in this case @xmath150 , so that the first term in eq.[eq : s2 ] vanishes .",
    "because of the @xmath151-function dynamic structure factor , the @xmath103-integration in eq.[eq : s2 ] is trivial . to perform the remaining ( one - dimensional ) @xmath68-integral",
    ", we adopt the usual procedure@xcite of replacing @xmath152 in the integrand and multiplying the integrand by an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath68-integration is then elementary and we obtain after straightforward algebra @xmath154    - \\frac{\\gamma}{2 }   \\ln \\left [ 1 + i ( \\tilde{v}_f + v_f ) q_c   t^{\\prime \\prime }      \\right ]    \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; ,    \\label{eq : qtlmres}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the well - known anomalous dimension of the tomonaga - luttinger model , and @xmath156 is the renormalized fermi velocity . for @xmath157 the eikonal result for the spectral function of the spinless tomonaga - luttinger model",

    "hence , for any finite interaction the integral in eq.[eq : grettlm ] is convergent , and we may omit the convergence factor @xmath160 in the exponent .",
    "following dzyaloshinksii and larkin@xcite , we find that for small @xmath161 and @xmath162 to leading order @xmath163 , where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are finite complex numbers .",
    "this is in striking disagreement with the well - known bosonization result@xcite , which predicts for @xmath166 a singularity of the type @xmath167 .",
    "thus , the real time eikonal method neither reproduces the correct scaling behavior of the spectral function , nor",
    "does it predict the correct location of its singularities .",
    "in this work we have compared the real time eikonal method with functional bosonization . in both methods the translationally invariant green s function @xmath168 of the many - body system is obtained by calculating first the green s function @xmath169 in a given background field , and then averaging the result with respect to a suitably defined gaussian effective action , @xmath170 .",
    "although both methods produce very similar non - perturbative expressions for @xmath169 , the final results for the functinal average @xmath171 are certainly not equivalent . in particular , in the case of the one - dimensional tomonaga - luttinger model the real time eikonal method",
    "does not even reproduce the correct scaling behavior of the green s function .",
    "we suspect that this shortcoming of the eikonal approach is related to the averaging in minkowski time , which can not be interpreted as averaging over an ordinary probability distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary time averaging performed in functional bosonization is mathematically well defined , and leads to an expression for the green s function which is exactly equivalent with the result obtained via operator bosonization@xcite .    because even at the level of the linearized theory the real time eikonal expansion can lead to incorrect results , we conclude that this method is not a good starting point for studying the effects associated with the curvature of the fermi surface on the low - energy behavior of the green s function of non - fermi liquids .",
    "inclusion of curvature effects is of particular importance in connection with the gauge field problem .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to study the effect of the non - linear terms in the energy dispersion on the leading ( linearized ) bosonization expression for the green s function entirely within the framework of the imaginary time approach described in sec.[sec : bos ] .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
