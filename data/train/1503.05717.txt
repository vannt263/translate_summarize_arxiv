    "the lorentz equation is one of the cornerstones of classical electrodynamics and it describes the motion of an electric charge , an electron for definiteness ( charge @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 ) , in the presence of an external , given electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the lorentz equation , however , does not take into account that , as the electron is being accelerated by the external field , it emits electromagnetic radiation , which in turn alters the trajectory of the electron itself ( radiation reaction ( rr ) ) .",
    "the search for the equation of motion of an electron moving in a given external electromagnetic field , including self - consistently the effects of rr , has already been pursued since the beginning of the 20th century . by starting from the lorentz equation of an electron in the presence of an external electromagnetic field and of the electromagnetic field produced by the electron itself , the so - called lorentz - abraham - dirac ( lad ) equation has been derived @xcite .",
    "after mass renormalization rr effects result in two force terms in the lad equation , one proportional to the linard formula for the radiated power and accounting for the energy - momentum loss of the electron due to radiation , the `` damping term '' , and the other one , the `` schott '' term , related to the electron s near field @xcite and accounting for the work done by the field emitted by the electron on the electron itself @xcite .",
    "unlike the damping term , the schott term , being proportional to the time derivative of the acceleration of the electron , 1 ) renders the lad equation a non - newtonian , third - order time differential equation ; and 2 ) allows for unphysical features of the lad equation as the existence of `` runaway solutions '' , with the electron acceleration exponentially diverging in the remote future , even if , for example , the external field identically vanishes @xcite .",
    "the origin of the inconsistencies of the lad equation has been identified in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that in the realm of classical electrodynamics , i.e. , when quantum effects can be neglected , a `` reduction of order '' can be consistently carried out in the lad equation , resulting in a second - order differential equation , known as the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation .",
    "moreover , quoting spohn @xcite , the physical solutions of the lad equation `` are on the critical manifold and are governed there by an effective second - order equation '' which is the ll equation .",
    "finally , the ll equation has been also derived from quantum electrodynamics in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the rapid progress of laser technology has renewed the interest in the problem of rr as the strong electromagnetic fields produced by lasers can violently accelerate the electron and consequently prime a substantial emission of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "correspondingly , a large number of setups and schemes have been recently proposed to measure classical rr effects in electron - laser interaction @xcite ( we refer to the review @xcite for previous proposals ) . however",
    ", experimental challenges either in the detection of relatively small rr effects or in the availability of sufficiently strong lasers has prevented so far any experimental test of the ll equation . moreover , since rr effects are larger for ultrarelativistic electrons , reported laser - based experimental tests of the ll equation turn out to be sensitive mainly to the damping term in the ll equation , which has the most favorable dependence on the electron lorentz factor .    in the present letter",
    "we adopt a different perspective and put forward a presently feasible experimental setup to measure classical rr effects on the radiation field , generated in the interaction of ultrarelativistic electrons with an aligned crystal .",
    "the experiment can already be performed at , e.g. , the cern secondary beam areas ( sba ) beamlines .",
    "in fact , in the proposed setup @xmath0 electrons impinge into a @xmath5 thick diamond crystal and emit a significant amount of radiation due to axial channeling @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that in this regime rr effects substantially alter the electromagnetic emission spectrum .",
    "moreover , unlike experimental proposals employing lasers , the distinct structure of the electric field of the crystal at axial channeling renders the emission spectrum more sensitive to a term in the ll equation originating from the controversial schott term in the lad equation .",
    "as we will see below , this term depends in general on the spacetime derivatives of the background field .",
    "this feature makes our setup prominent also with respect to synchrotron facilities where the electron dynamics is dominated by the damping term .",
    "we also mention that at an electron energy @xmath6 and for a typical synchrotron radius @xmath7 , the relative electron energy loss per turn is @xmath8 ^ 3/r[\\text{m}]=2.4\\times 10^{-3}$ ] @xcite , which would induce too small effects on the emitted radiation to be measured .",
    "in addition , in order for the synchrotron to operate during many turns , the electron energy loss has to be precisely compensated preventing again any possibility of `` accumulating '' and measuring rr effects on the emitted radiation .",
    "when a high - energy electron impinges onto a single crystal along a direction of high symmetry , its motion can become transversely bound and its dynamics determined by a coherent scattering in the collective , screened field of many atoms aligned along the direction of symmetry ( axial channeling ) @xcite . in this regime the electron experiences an effective potential in the transverse directions ( continuum potential ) , resulting from the average of the atomic potential along the direction of symmetry .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in the present and in the next section we assume that the atomic potential is due to a single string . by indicating as @xmath9 the direction corresponding to the symmetry axis of the crystal and by @xmath10 the coordinates in the transverse plane , with the atomic string crossing this plane at @xmath11 ,",
    "the continuum potential @xmath12 depends only on the distance @xmath13 and it can be approximated as @xcite : @xmath14,\\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here , the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 depend on the crystal and @xmath21 . a convenient choice to investigate classical rr effects is diamond , with , e.g. , the @xmath22 as symmetry axis and for which @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the relatively low value of @xmath17 as compared to other crystals allows one to neglect quantum effects also at relatively high electron energies .",
    "the depth @xmath27 of the potential in diamond is such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron potential energy ( units with @xmath30 and @xmath31 are employed throughout ) .",
    "in general , the channeling regime of interaction features ultrastrong electromagnetic fields , which can lead to substantial energy loss of the radiating electron . in order for quantum effects to be negligible , we require that @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 is the initial lorentz factor of the electron , @xmath34 is a measure of the amplitude of the electric field @xmath35 $ ] in the crystal , and @xmath36 is the critical electric field of qed . by employing @xmath37 as an estimate of @xmath34 ,",
    "it is @xmath38|u_m[\\text{ev}]|/\\rho_c[\\text{\\aa}]$ ] .    in the classical regime",
    "@xmath39 the electron dynamics including rr effects is described by the ll equation @xcite .",

    "now , we assume that the crystal extends from @xmath45 to @xmath46 and that at the initial time @xmath47 , the electron s position and velocity are @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively ( @xmath51 ) . with these initial conditions , due to the symmetry of the potential @xmath12 ,",
    "it is @xmath52 and @xmath53 along the electron trajectory .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ ll ] )",
    "substantially simplifies and only the equation @xmath54 for @xmath55 is needed below , with @xmath56 .",
    "if one first neglects rr , the total energy @xmath57 is a constant of motion . in the ultrarelativistic regime @xmath58 of interest here and for typical crystal parameters",
    "it results @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 $ ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , energy conservation implies that @xmath61 ( recall that @xmath62 @xcite ) .",
    "finally , with the considered initial conditions , the quantity @xmath55 is periodic in time , with period @xmath63 and angular frequency @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the considerations above based on the single - string approximation allow us to evaluate the effects of rr on the electron dynamics analytically .",
    "in fact , as it can be verified _ a posteriori _ , it is safe to assume that @xmath59 and that @xmath65 also including rr .",
    "thus , by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) by @xmath66 and by neglecting corrections proportional to @xmath67 , it is easy to prove that ( see also @xcite ) @xmath68 where the integral is performed along the electron trajectory . in order to get an analytical insight on the motion of the electron ,",
    "we assume here that @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , with @xmath73 ( @xmath74 for diamond ) .",
    "equation ( [ ll_x ] ) with @xmath75 and eq . ( [ epsilon ] ) show that the electron dynamics along the @xmath76 direction is characterized by three time scales : one , @xmath77 , proper of the lorentz dynamics and two additional , @xmath78 introduced by rr and corresponding to the term containing @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) and to the one proportional to @xmath80 in eq .",

    "the initial energy of the electron is @xmath102 , the initial position is @xmath86 , and the final time corresponds to a crystal thickness of @xmath103 ( see also below ) .",
    "the above numerical example only aims at showing the validity of our approximated analytical treatment and it has to be pointed out that for the used numerical parameters quantum effects in the transverse motion of the electron could not be neglected ( as it will be clear below , the electrons initially so close to an atomic string do not significantly contribute to the average emission spectra measured in experiments ) .",
    "we have ensured in the above numerical example that the trend shown in fig .",
    "[ x_t ] , with rr `` focusing '' the electron s transverse motion to amplitudes much smaller than @xmath104 , occurs for all allowed @xmath105 .",
    "the above considerations provide an analytical insight on the effects of rr but hold under the assumption that the crystal potential can be approximated by the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "below , we will investigate numerically the effects of rr on the emission spectra of electrons crossing a diamond crystal along the axis @xmath106 , with the crystal field being represented more realistically than above by a periodic replica of the doyle - turner potential @xcite .",
    "considering the distribution of the strings along the @xmath107 plane perpendicular to the axis @xmath106 of diamond , at each instant we have included the effects of the 16 + 25=41 strings within a square centered on the string closest to the electron . in order to obtain results",
    "more easily comparable with experimental results , the reported single - particle spectra result from the average over 200 electrons all with the same incoming momentum ( along the @xmath108-direction ) and energy @xmath6 , and uniformly distributed over the cell @xmath109 , with @xmath110 being the diamond lattice constant .",
    "now , rr effects are clearly larger for thicker crystals",
    ". however , an upper limit to `` meaningful '' values of the crystal thickness is set by the dechanneling , i.e. , by the fact that , due to multiple coulomb scattering with the atoms in the crystal , the transverse amplitude of the electron motion increases and , after a certain distance @xmath111 ( dechanneling length ) , the electron leaves the `` channel '' generated by a single atomic string @xcite .",
    "the term `` meaningful '' above thus refers to the fact that for a crystal thickness much larger than @xmath111 , the electron will not anyway emit channeling radiation after a distance of the order of @xmath111 .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of the dechanneling length @xmath111 for an electron initially propagating along the atomic string is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath114 being the crystal atomic number and @xmath115 its atomic density , is the radiation length in the amorphous case @xcite . in order to implement the effects of multiple scattering and of dechanneling on the electron motion , we started from the kinetic equation describing the evolution of the transverse velocity with respect to time , which can be approximated as a fokker - planck equation with diffusion coefficient @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the thickness of the crystal @xcite ( note that the dechanneling length corresponds to the thickness obtained by equating the quantity @xmath119 with the lindhard critical angle @xmath120 ) .",
    "based on the equivalence between the fokker - planck kinetic equation and a single - particle stochastic equation @xcite , we have added the stochastic term @xmath121 to the equation of motion for the transverse velocity @xmath122 of the electron , where @xmath123 is the vector stochastic variable corresponding to the wiener process and having the dimension of the square root of time @xcite . each spectrum",
    "has then been obtained by averaging over five spectra , every one being obtained with an independent sequence of random numbers corresponding to the stochastic variable @xmath123 .",
    "we point out that the diffusion coefficient @xmath124 corresponds to the amorphous case , whereas the electrons within a disk of radius @xmath125 and centered on a string , with @xmath126 being the average thermal vibration amplitude on the plane perpendicular to the string , would see a relatively high nuclear density and would dechannel at distances significantly smaller than @xmath111 . in order to include the effect of the higher nuclear density in the vicinity of the strings , we have followed ref .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] three single - electron energy spectra @xmath132 are shown as a function of @xmath133 , with @xmath134 being the emitted radiation angular frequency , and for a crystal thickness of @xmath135 . in order to test specifically the importance of the derivative term in the ll equation ( [ ll ] )",
    ", we show the spectrum without rr terms ( dashed green curve ) , with rr terms except the derivative one ( dotted blue curve ) , and with all rr terms ( continuous red curve ) .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding spectra without the inclusion of multiple scattering .",

    "the lorentz equation corresponds to the dashed green curve and the ll equation to the dotted blue curve ( without the derivative term ) and to the continuous red curve ( with the derivative term ) . for the considered numerical parameters ,",
    "the local constant crossed field approximation @xcite , which requires @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the average free - electron laser ( fel ) parameter , with @xmath141 , can not be applied here .",

    "rr as functions of the initial transverse coordinates of the electron ( a crystal atomic string is at the origin of the coordinates ) .",
    "the numerical parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . ]    going back to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the main effect of rr is to increase the radiation yield at low frequencies and the derivative term in the ll equation enhances this effect .",
    "the resulting lowering of the average emitted radiation frequency can be understood qualitatively as rr effects tend to reduce the electron energy and the average electric field experienced by the electron .",
    "the reduction of the average electric field experienced by the electron , corresponding to the parameter @xmath143 is not obvious because rr also induces a cooling effect in the transverse motion ( see , e.g. fig .",
    "1 ) which , for some values of the initial electron s position , might let the electron spend more time in regions where the electric field is large . in figs .",
    "4b and 4c we show the quantity @xmath143 as a function of @xmath145 and @xmath146 without rr ( fig .",
    "4b ) and with rr ( fig .",
    "4c ) ) and , again , ignoring multiple scattering for simplicity ( as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] multiple scattering does not alter qualitatively the effects of rr ) .",
    "although , for some values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 rr indeed induces an increase of @xmath143 , for those initial conditions closer to the atomic string and corresponding to the largest values of @xmath143 , rr induces a reduction .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that rr effects are most important at the peak of the emission spectrum corresponding to photon energies of the order of @xmath147 , where quantum effects are safely negligible .",
    "the enhancement of rr effects due to the derivative term in the ll equation can be qualitatively understood going back to the simplified model in section 2 and by noticing that the derivative @xmath148 is largest at small @xmath76 , where @xmath149 , such that the corresponding term in eq .",
    "( [ ll_x ] ) acts as an additional `` cooling '' term .",
    "it is also worth observing that multiple scattering with the nuclei tends to increase the transverse electron energy .",
    "as expected , this `` heating '' effect , on the one hand decreases the overall emission yield and , on the other hand , also suppresses the cooling effect due to rr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows that for the chosen numerical parameters , the effects of rr and in particular of the derivative term in the ll equation are still sizable , although detecting the latter experimentally may prove to be challenging .    finally , on the one hand , our numerical model including the effect of multiple atomic strings on the electron motion takes into account automatically the radiation by dechanneled electrons in the corresponding potential .",
    "on the other hand , it can be checked that the contribution @xmath150 of incoherent bremsstrahlung to the emission spectrum for the numerical example in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] is negligible .",
    "in fact , starting from the bethe - heitler cross section ( see e.g. eq . ( 27 ) in @xcite ) , it can be seen that in the region @xmath151 , the function @xmath150 is approximately constant and @xmath152 by plugging the numerical parameters corresponding to the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , one obtains that @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , we have ensured that by also accounting for the higher nuclear density experienced by the electrons close to the atomic strings at channeling than in an amorphous medium , the effect of incoherent bremsstrahlung is still negligible .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , this amounts in multiplying the quantity @xmath150 by the enhancing factor @xmath154 .",
    "we have ensured that , by including the effects of rr and of multiple scattering , the quantity @xmath154 is typically smaller than 10 for almost all initial conditions as in fig . 4 and that its average value with respect to the initial conditions is typically less than 3 .",
    "measurement of the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] is possible using a setup as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expfig ] .        after passing the scintillators s1-s3",
    ", the electrons go through two position - sensitive mimosa detectors m1 and m2 @xcite encased in helium to reduce multiple scattering , in order to determine their incoming angle @xcite . by deflecting the charged particles outgoing from the crystal via the large magnet , only the emitted photons hit a converter foil to produce electron - positron pairs . by measuring the energy of the pairs employing the small magnet ,",
    "the energy of the photons can be determined .",
    "the case considered here of electrons initially moving along the atomic string is a reasonable approximation as long as the electrons impinge with angles to the atomic string on a scale of order of or smaller than the lindhard critical angle @xmath155 .",
    "electrons with an angular divergence comparable to @xmath156 can indeed be achieved at the cern sba @xcite . the spectrum including rr in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] corresponds to each electron emitting approximately 4.4 photons capable of pair production in the converter foil . in order to avoid pileup and obtain single - photon spectra",

    "a rate of 2000 electrons per minute can be achieved implying a measurement time of about 24 hours .",

    "the required experimental conditions are available at the cern sba beamlines .",
    "most importantly , the effects of the derivative term in the ll equation are shown to affect the emission spectra much more than in previous proposals based on intense lasers fields although the measurability of such effects may be challenging . in this respect ,",
    "we point out that the present one represents the first investigation on testing the ll equation in aligned crystals and a more complete and quantitatively precise study would include other effects than those already considered here as the incidence angle of the electrons or the efficiency and the resolution of the detectors .",
