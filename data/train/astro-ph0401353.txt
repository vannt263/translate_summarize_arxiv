    "in 1995 , the hubble deep field ( hdf ) became the most well - studied extragalactic area in all of observational astronomy .",
    "extremely deep optical exposures taken with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ were eventually joined by additional imaging and spectroscopic observations from many observatories covering all wavelengths ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this combined dataset  which was ultimately expanded to include a complementary field in the southern sky  painted an extraordinarily detailed picture of a `` blank '' region of sky which turned out to be teeming with galaxies , providing astronomers with an exquisite window into the high - redshift universe .",
    "the result was a series of important advances in the properties of distant galaxies and large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "many of these key discoveries depended critically upon knowledge of galaxy redshifts , the vast majority of which were obtained by a variety of observers using the lris spectrograph @xcite on the twin 10  m telescopes of the w. m. keck observatory @xcite .",
    "nearly ten years later , attention has returned to the northern hdf field ( hdf - n ) via an ambitious plan to use a new generation of ground- and space - based instruments for probing the distant universe in even greater detail .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) project involves a coordinated effort by three of nasa s great observatories to obtain ultra - deep images of two selected fields in the optical ( via the _ hst _",
    "advanced camera for surveys ) , infrared ( with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ ) , and x - ray ( using _ chandra _ ) wavelength regimes .",
    "these two fields include a northern target area coincident with ( but significantly larger than ) the hdf - n plus a similarly - sized southern field coincident with the chandra deep field - south .",
    "again , intensive ground - based followup observations in all wavelength regimes are underway to exploit this high - resolution space - based imaging .",
    "high - quality spectra of the many galaxies in the goods fields will , as before , be essential to understand both large - scale structure and galaxy evolution within these regions .",
    "keck remains the most powerful northern - hemisphere observatory for completing deep surveys of faint galaxies .",
    "its efficient new deimos spectrograph @xcite on the keck  ii telescope was designed specifically for acquiring multislit spectroscopy of over 100 faint galaxies at once , and with its @xmath6 field of view is ideally suited to survey the @xmath7 goods - north ( hereafter goods - n ) field .",
    "presented with this unique opportunity to make an important contribution to the community , the wmko director and scientific staff elected to complete a deep deimos survey of this region and committed to releasing the resulting data to the community as rapidly as possible .",
    "we report herein the results of this `` team keck '' treasury redshift survey ( hereafter , tkrs ) in the goods",

    "section  [ sxn - analysis ] presents the redshift and rest - frame color distribution for our targets , and  [ sxn - summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "to ensure timely access to a catalog of astrometric positions and approximate magnitudes for completing the spectroscopy , we generated our own independent catalog of sources in the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "we acquired a series of @xmath8  s @xmath1-band exposures using deimos in imaging mode on keck ii during the night of 2002 dec 30 ( ut ) , and complemented these with additional images obtained on 2003 feb 02 ( ut ) to complete coverage of the full acs imaging region .",
    "the exposures were offset and dithered to compensate for the gaps in the deimos ccd mosaic .",
    "all images were bias subtracted and gain corrected , then flatfielded with sky flats generated from the set of 14 images acquired in this field .",
    "we employed an automated procedure to detect cosmic rays on each image and ignored the affected pixels in all subsequent processing .",
    "the mean sky level on each image was measured via an iterative sigma clipping algorithm and subtracted to eliminate sky brightness variations from the data set .",
    "next , we used deimos images of an astrometric field to derive a distortion correction map which we applied to the images of the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "this allowed us to shift and co - add the science images , yielding a mosaic image that covered the entire @xmath7 first - epoch acs imaging field . for this survey , we only considered the portion of this mosaic image coincident with the first epoch _ hst _  goods - n observations .",
    "we obtained a first - order plate solution for this mosaic using several stars measured in the usno astrometric catalog @xcite .    to generate our target catalog we used the sextractor  package @xcite to detect positive fluctuations at least 20  px in size with a threshold of 1.0 times the rms sky noise .",
    "because of vignetting near the edges of the deimos imaging field of view , the final mosaic image contains a few regions with spurious detections .",
    "these bogus objects are generally very faint , and most were excluded from the final catalogue because they lie below the faint magnitude cutoff of the sample .",
    "although the usno catalog provided an effective first - order astrometric solution for the goods - n mosaic image , the small number of sources available in this field limited the accuracy of the solution .",
    "the resultant rms positional uncertainty of approximately @xmath9 is a significant fraction of the @xmath10 slit width for spectroscopy , and hence a more accurate solution was needed to produce acceptable slitmask designs . in order to improve the object positions",
    ", we used a catalogue of objects in this region kindly provided by the sdss team @xcite which produced a list of 130 stars common to both catalogs .",
    "this permitted us to refine the astrometric solution and obtain a final rms residual of @xmath11 , more than adequate for our needs .",
    "comparing our derived astrometric coordinates to those obtained independently by @xcite , we find no measureable offset in ( @xmath12 ) and a dispersion of @xmath13 , indicating excellent agreement .",
    "our coordinates agree less well in absolute zero point with those @xcite obtained from _ hst _",
    "imaging , against which the dispersion is @xmath14 but the offsets are @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; this suggests a slight error in absolute astrometric positions for the acs catalog . for several saturated stars which we wanted to use for rough slitmask alignment purposes ,",
    "we derived estimated celestial coordinates positions visually by estimating the ( @xmath12 ) coordinates for the location at the convergence points of the diffraction spikes .",
    "the unsaturated stars also served as photometric calibrators .",
    "the magnitudes we used were ` mag_best ` calculated by sextractor , which are designed to estimate the total light .",
    "since only @xmath17 magnitudes were available from the sdss database , we were unable to include any color terms in our photometric calibration .",
    "for the 130 stars shared between the tkrs and sdss catalogs , the rms difference is @xmath18  mag .",

    "the selection of objects for spectroscopic observations followed roughly the same guidelines as used by the deep2 redshift survey @xcite , with one major difference : no attempt was made to use brightness , color , or other information to exclude stars and lower - redshift galaxies from the sample .",
    "all objects brighter than the limiting magnitude were potential spectroscopic targets , regardless of whether their appearance was stellar or galactic . at the magnitude limit of this survey the number of stars relative to the number of galaxies is small , so that the adopted strategy avoids excluding agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "deimos uses slitmasks to record over 100 broadband spectra at once .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the spectroscopic sample , the number of available nights and uniformity of wavelength coverage were all considered in designing slitmasks for our survey .",

    "slits were typically aligned with the major axis to improve both @xmath20 and rotational velocity measurements .",
    "for closely spaced objects , slit position angles were chosen such that the spectra of both objects were recorded .",

    "<S> we report the results of an extensive imaging and spectroscopic survey in the goods - north field completed using deimos on the keck ii telescope . observations of 2018 targets in a magnitude - limited sample of 2911 objects to @xmath0 yield secure redshifts for a sample of 1440 galaxies and agn plus 96 stars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to redshifts and associated quality assessments , our catalog also includes photometric and astrometric measurements for all targets detected in our @xmath1-band imaging survey of the goods - north region . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate various sources of incompleteness and find the redshift catalog to be 53% complete at its limiting magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the median redshift of @xmath2 is lower than in similar deep surveys because we did not select against low - redshift targets .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison with other redshift surveys in the same field , including a complementary hawaii - led deimos survey , establishes that our velocity uncertainties are as low as @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  for red galaxies and that our redshift confidence assessments are accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of rest - frame magnitudes and colors among the sample agree well with model predictions out to and beyond @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we will release all survey data , including extracted 1-d and sky - subtracted 2-d spectra , thus providing a sizable and homogeneous database for the goods - north field which will enable studies of large scale structure , spectral indices , internal galaxy kinematics , and the predictive capabilities of photometric redshifts . </S>"
