    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the numerical techniques necessary to perform calculations of this reaction .",
    "currently this can be done only nonrelativistically , which is a major restriction and leads to serious difficulties in interpretation of many experiments performed at high energy and momentum transfers .",
    "due to large differences between the nonrelativistic and relativistic kinematics an analysis of such experiments can not be undertaken within a strictly nonrelativistic framework .",
    "we are not aware of any consistent , relativistic 3n scattering calculation .",
    "also in the present paper we report about a less rigorous approach to the description of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes .",
    "this approach does not include all final state interactions ( fsi ) among the three outgoing nucleons but restricts the rescattering to only one `` spectator '' pair of nucleons which is assumed not to take part in the photon absorption .",
    "there are definitely kinematical regions where such a reaction mechanism seems to be plausible .",

    "( [ psirlmom ] ) and ( [ psibst ] ) are identical , i.e. the wave function is represented in a way , which does not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "this is possible because the relative momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 in both cases are defined in the 2n c.m . system .",
    "a formalism for treating the relativistic three - body faddeev equations was introduced in @xcite .",
    "since the formal structure of the 3n hamiltonian @xmath37 is the same for relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches , the formal derivation of the faddeev equations is also the same in both cases @xcite .",

    "the boosted potential is then given by the nn bound state wave function and the half - shell nn t - matrices obtained in the 2n c.m . system .",

    "it is possible to construct @xmath19 directly ( see for example @xcite ) or start with a particular modern nonrelativistic potential @xmath61 and apply a scale transformation from @xcite to generate a phase equivalent relativistic potential @xmath19 .",
    "this second method was criticized in @xcite but nevertheless it remains a possibility for practical calculations .",
    "since the general expression for boosted potential @xmath62 given in @xcite is quite complicated it is desirable to find an approximation simplifying numerical calculations .",
    "a simple choice is a restriction to the leading order term in a @xmath63 and @xmath64 expansion @xmath65 what turned out to be sufficient for a wide range of @xmath66 values @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "both , for the proton and neutron knockout , the cross sections vary by many orders of magnitude .",
    "there is always a very steep rise when the nucleon energy approaches its maximal value but the cross section for the proton case is always approximately factor 10 larger than the corresponding neutron observable .",
    "the pwia and fsi23 predictions for small @xmath213 values are negligible and differ very much both from the pwias and results taking fsi fully into account . except for the @xmath201 kinematics",
    ", we can always find an energy interval ( at least on the logarithmic scale ) where the group of the fsi23 lines is very close to the curve obtained with the full inclusion of fsi ( when applicable ) .",
    "as expected , for the @xmath209 and @xmath202 kinematics the difference between the fully nonrelativistic and the other fsi23 results is best visible .",
    "the effects which we see for the @xmath203 kinematics are magnified by the trivial differences in the allowed energy ranges .",
    "many important observables in electron induced breakup of @xmath2he are measured in kinematical regions , where a nonrelativistic approach is not applicable . thus an approximation is needed with some relativistic features included , which can serve as a practical tool to analyze results of such experiments .",
    "one possibility is to extend the so - called fsi23 approximation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) which has been used since many years to include some relativistic ingredients .    in this study we added to this approach a consistent relativistic treatment of the initial 3n bound state , the relativistic single nucleon current operator , the relativistic boosted nn scattering operator and relativistic kinematics .",
    "we studied a number of electron kinematics , mostly on a quasi - elastic scattering line , in order to estimate the effects of these new relativistic ingredients .",
    "we found out that the bulk of relativistic effects comes from the relativistic kinematics .",
    "further ( consistent with kinematics ) relativistic features of the calculation are less important . for the kinematics within the shaded area of fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath201 , @xmath214 , @xmath206 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 ) , even in the neighborhood of the highest energy of the ejected nucleon , the fsi23s and the full fsi are different .",
    "therefore the full fsi treatment is mandatory for a quantitative analysis . on top , especially for the @xmath203 and @xmath204 kinematics some relativistic effects are noticeable and should be included in the future analyzes of correspondingly precise data . for the kinematics @xmath209 and @xmath202 in the range of highest nucleon energies the relativistic effects",
    "are clearly visible , especially for neutron emission , and should be taken into account in the analysis of experimental data . whether full fsi effects will be present there , too , can not be answered by us right now .",
    "nevertheless , as the first step the constructed approximate framework can be used to analyze experimental data taken at high energy and momentum transfers . in the future",
    "it should be replaced by fully relativistic calculations not available at the moment which include all fsi s along the lines of the approach applied in the 3n continuum in @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the polish committee for scientific research under grant no .",
    "one of us ( w.g . ) would like to thank the foundation for polish science for the financial support during his stay in krakw .",
