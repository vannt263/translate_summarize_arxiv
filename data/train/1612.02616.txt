    "the existence of pre - defined values for quantum observables that are independent of any measurement settings , has been a matter of debate ever since quantum theory came into existence .",
    "while einstein made a case for looking for hidden variable theories that would give such values  @xcite , the work of john bell proved that such local hidden variable theories can not be compatible with quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "this points towards a fundamental departure of the behavior of quantum correlations from the ones that can be accommodated within classical descriptions .",
    "while the departure from classical behavior indicated by bell s inequalities requires composite quantum systems and the assumption of locality , the contradiction between assignment of predefined measurement independent values to observables and quantum mechanics goes deeper and was brought out more vividly by the discovery of quantum contextuality@xcite . in a non - contextual classical description",
    ", a joint probability distribution exists for the results of any joint measurements on the system , and the results of a measurement of a variable do not depend on other compatible variables being measured .",
    "quantum mechanics precludes such a description of physical reality ; on the contrary in the quantum description , there exists a context among the measurement outcomes , which forbids us from arriving at joint probability distributions of more than two observables .",
    "given a situation where an observable @xmath0 commutes with two other observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 which do not commute with each other : a measurement of @xmath0 along with @xmath1 and a measurement of @xmath0 along with @xmath2 , may lead to different measurement outcomes for @xmath0 .",
    "thus , to be able to make quantum mechanical predictions about the outcome of a measurement , the context of the measurement needs to be specified .",
    "the first proof that the quantum world is contextual , involving 117 different vector in a 3-dimensional hilbert space was given by kochen and specker  @xcite .",
    "since then , the number of observables needed for such a ` no - coloring ' proof was brought down to 31 by j. conway and s. kochen , and a set of 33 observables , found by a. peres  @xcite utilizes cubic symmetry and gives a more compact proof . in higher dimensions",
    "the number of observables can be further reduced and more compact proofs are possible  @xcite .",
    "klyachko _ et.al .",
    "_ found a minimal set of 5 observables on a qutrit for which the predicted value for quantum correlations exceeds the bound ( the kcbs inequality ) imposed by non - contextual deterministic probabilistic models  @xcite .",
    "the violation observed is state dependent and one can find states that do not allow for stronger than classical correlations for the same set of observables .",
    "a state independent violation of a non - contextuality inequality implies that stronger than classical correlations are possible for all states  @xcite for the same set of observables . in a 3-dimensional hilbert space",
    "the minimum number of observables required to achieve such a violation is 13  @xcite and can be brought down to 9 if one excludes the maximally mixed state  @xcite .",
    "recently graph theory has also been used to describe contextuality scenarios  @xcite , where vertices and edges describe unit vectors and the orthogonality relationships between them respectively . while at the level of individual measurements quantum mechanics is contextual , the probability distribution for an observable @xmath0 does not depend upon the context and is not disturbed by other compatible observables being measured .",
    "this is called the ` no - disturbance ' principle and leads to interesting monogamy relations for contextuality inequalities similar to those obeyed by bell - type inequalities  @xcite .",
    "these monogamy relations are a powerful expression of quantum constraints on correlations without involving a tensor product structure , and we shall exploit them in our work .    for quantum computation and quantum communication , non - trivial features of the world play a fundamental role  @xcite .",
    "quantum key distribution protocols are fundamentally secure as opposed to the classical schemes where the security algorithms rely on quantum correlations , the most striking examples being the bb84  @xcite and ekert protocols  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that any two non - orthogonal states suffices for quantum key distribution  @xcite and the idea was extended to qutrits  @xcite to allow four mutually unbiased bases . the quantum key distribution protocol formulated by ekert",
    "@xcite , utilized properties of bell states to achieve secure key distribution .",
    "quantum cryptography protocols have been proven to be robust against eavesdropping and noise  @xcite and perform better than classical ones  @xcite .    our focus in this work",
    "is to explore the utility of quantum contextuality for quantum key distribution .",
    "while contextuality has been exploited for quantum key distribution  @xcite , we propose a new quantum key distribution protocol which is based on the kcbs inequality and contextuality monogamy  @xcite .",
    "in fact in our protocol it is the monogamy relations of the kcbs inequalities which provide the security to the protocol .",
    "we compare our protocol with existing ones and find it to be highly robust against any eavesdropping attack .",
    "we explicitly calculate the error rates introduced into alice - bob communication due to the presence of eve , and also calculate the information gained by eve for specific attack scenarios .",
    "the material in the paper is arranged as follows : in section  [ kcbs ] we review the kcbs inequalities and their monogamy relations , in section  [ the_protocol ] we describe our protocol and discuss its security .",
    "section  [ conc ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "[ protocol ]",
    "consider a set of five observables which are projectors in a 3-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the projectors are related via an orthogonality graph as given in figure  [ fig : kcbsineq ] .",
    "the vertices in the graph correspond to the projectors , and two projectors which are connected by an edge are orthogonal to each other .",
    "a deterministic non - contextual model must assign a value @xmath3 or @xmath4 to the @xmath5 vertex and therefore the probability that the vertex is assigned a value @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath6 , takes values @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "in such a non - contextual assignment the maximum number of vertices that can be assigned the probability @xmath7 ( constrained by the exclusivity principle ) , is 2 irrespective of the state .",
    "therefore , @xmath8",
    "this is the kcbs inequality  @xcite , which is a state - dependent test of contextuality utilizing these projectors , and is satisfied by all non - contextual deterministic models . in a quantum mechanical description ,",
    "given a quantum state and the projector @xmath9 we can calculate the probabilities @xmath6 readily and it turns out that the sum total probability can take values upto @xmath10 , with the maximum value attained for a particular pure state . therefore , quantum mechanics does not respect non - contextual assignments and is a contextual theory . in a more general scenario , where we only use the exclusivity principle - that the sum of probabilities for two mutually exclusive events",
    "can not be greater than one - we get the algebraic maximum @xmath11 of the inequality ( _ i.e. _ @xmath12 ) . unlike in inequality  ( [ eq1 ] ) , here @xmath6s can take continuous values in the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the bounds so imposed by the non - contextual , quantum and exclusivity principle can be identified with graph theoretic invariants of the exclusivity graph of the five projectors , which in this case is also a pentagon  @xcite .",
    "the correlations can be further analyzed if one considers observables which take values @xmath14 related to the projectors considered above as @xmath15 it can be shown  @xcite that correlations between these observables have to obey the following inequality as a consequence of eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is sum modulo 5 .",
    "this gives us another version of the kcbs inequality that we shall use directly .",
    "in quantum mechanics given observables @xmath18 , such that @xmath0 can be jointly measured both with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( i.e. it is compatible with both ) the marginal probability distribution @xmath19 for @xmath0 as calculated from both the joint probability distributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the same .",
    "@xmath22 this is called the ` no - disturbance ' principle and it reduces to the ` no - signaling ' principle when the measurements @xmath1 and @xmath2 are performed on spatially separate systems  @xcite .",
    "the ` no - disturbance ' principle can be used to construct contextual monogamy of a set of observables if they can be partitioned into disjoint subsets each of which can reveal contextuality by themselves but can not be simultaneously used for a tests of contextuality .",
    "consider a situation where alice bob and eve are agents which make measurements .",
    "later we will use this in a situation where alice and bob are trying to do qkd and eve is an eavesdropper and in order to gain optimal information about the key , eve uses the same kcbs scenario with the same projectors as alice and bob .",
    "we denote the alice - bob kcbs test by kcbs@xmath23 with projectors @xmath24 and alice - eve kcbs test by kcbs@xmath25 with projectors @xmath26 .",
    "since the tests will be performed on the same state as prepared and transmitted by alice , the two scenarios will share some commutation relationships amongst themselves as shown in figure  [ fig : mono ] . in this joint scenario",
    "the @xmath27 projector is connected by an edge to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath17 and @xmath33 are taken modulo 5 and the presence of an edge denotes commutativity between the two connected vertices .",
    "these relationships follow from the fact that the projectors used by eve are the same as alice and bob s and will follow the same commutativity relationships as the original kcbs scenario . by introducing herself in the channel , eve has created an extended kcbs scenario which will have to obey contextuality monogamy due to the no - disturbance principle .    by the no - disturbance principle one",
    "is guaranteed that the marginal probabilities as calculated from the joint probability distribution do not depend on the choice of the joint probability distribution used .    as shown in  @xcite a joint commutation graph representing a set of @xmath34 kcbs - type inequalities",
    "each of which has a non - contextual bound @xmath35 gives rise to a monogamy relationship if and only if its vertex clique cover number is @xmath36 .",
    "the joint commutation graph considered in the protocol resulting from interference by eve satisfies the condition for the existence of a monogamy relationship between alice - bob and alice - eve kcbs inequalities .    in order to derive the monogamy relationship one needs to identify @xmath37 chordal sub - graphs of the joint commutation graph such that the sum of their independence numbers is @xmath36 .",
    "a chordal graph is a graph which does not contain induced cycles of length greater than 3 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite a chordal graph admits a joint probability distribution and therefore can not violate a contextuality inequality . to this end",
    "we identify the decomposition of the joint commutation graph into two chordal subgraphs such that each vertex appears at most once in both the subgraphs , as shown in figure  [ fig : mono ] .",
    "their maximum non - contextual bound will be given by the independence number of the subgraph .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 adding and grouping the terms according to their contextual inequalities @xmath39 if the projectors involved in the kcbs tests are transformed according to eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) , the monogamy relationship reads as @xmath40 the above inequality follows from the no - disturbance principle .",
    "the kcbs inequality and the contextuality monogamy as described above can be used to achieve secure key generation among two separated parties as we shall see in the next section .",
    "in a typical key - distribution situation , two separated parties alice and bob want to share a secret key securely .",
    "they both have access to the kcbs scenario of five projectors .",
    "alice randomly selects a vertex @xmath41 and prepares the corresponding pure state @xmath9 and transmits the state to bob .",
    "bob on his part , also randomly selects a vertex @xmath42 and performs a measurement @xmath43 on the state .",
    "the outcome of bob s measurement depends on whether he ended up measuring in the context of alice s state or not .",
    "the outcome @xmath44 is assigned the value @xmath4 and @xmath45 is assigned the value @xmath3 . after the measurement , bob publicly announces his measurement choice , namely the vertex @xmath42 .",
    "three distinct cases arise :    * @xmath46 are adjacent : bob s projector is in context of alice s state .",
    "since the state alice is sending is orthogonal to bob s chosen projector , he is assured to get the outcome @xmath3 .",
    "alice then notes down @xmath4 with herself and publicly announces that the transmission was successful and bob uses his outcome as part of the key .",
    "this way they both share an anti - correlated bit .",
    "* @xmath46 are same(@xmath47 ) : by definition bob is assured to get the outcome @xmath4 .",
    "alice notes down a @xmath3 with herself and publicly announces that the transmission was successful .",
    "again both of them share an anti - correlation .",
    "* @xmath46 are non - adjacent : bob s projector does not lie in the context of alice s state .",
    "alice publicly announces that the transmission was unsuccessful and they try again .",
    "however they keep this data , as it may turn out to be useful to detect eve .    using the protocol ,",
    "alice and bob can securely share a random binary key .",
    "their success depends on chances that bob s measurements are made in the context of alice s state . whenever bob measures in the correct context , by making appropriate choices alice is able to ensure that they always have an anti - correlated key bit .",
    "when bob measures in the same context but not the same projector as alice , she notes down a 1 with herself and thus they share a 1 - 0 anti - correlation . on the other hand , when bob measures the same projector as alice s state , she notes down a 0 with herself and again they share a 0 - 1 anti - correlation . at no stage alice needs to reveal her state in public or to bob .",
    "the scenario is depicted in figure  [ protocol_channel ] .    ) , while eve in her attempts to gain information is trying to violate the same inequality with alice ( kcbs@xmath25 ) .",
    "eve s simplest strategy is to intercept and resend the state sent by alice to bob . ]",
    "since the channel over which alice sends the quantum states to bob is in principle insecure , we can imagine that a third party eve tries to eavesdrop on the conversation between alice and bob .",
    "eve s objective is to gain as much information about the key that alice and bob are trying to generate and cause as little disturbance as possible in the channel .",
    "after all she could be detected from the disturbance that she causes !",
    "the objective of alice and bob is to achieve an anti - correlated pair .",
    "to do so , bob tries to perform measurements in the context of alice s state , and in a successful transmission , alice notes down the outcome anti - correlated to bob s . transforming the projectors to take on the outcomes @xmath48 , it is seen that alice and bob are trying to achieve the algebraic maximum of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : kcbs ] ) , which is @xmath49 where @xmath17 is sum modulo 5 .",
    "any attack by eve must be such that her measurements are in the context of alice , without disturbing the context of alice and bob .",
    "ultimately , she gains optimal information only when violating the kcbs inequality with alice .",
    "however , it is shown that if alice and bob are maximally violating the kcbs inequality together , then alice and eve can not do so and vice versa .",
    "this is the principle of contextuality monogamy  @xcite and is quite similar to bell monogamy  @xcite .",
    "the situation is as depicted in figure  [ fig : mono ] we denote by kcbs@xmath50 the contextual correlations between alice and bob and by kcbs@xmath51 as defined in the section  [ kcbs ] .",
    "the contextual correlations between alice and eve and the monogamy relationship given in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : mono3 ] ) play a key role .",
    "since alice - bob are achieving the algebraic maximum of the kcbs@xmath23 inequality , alice - eve will never be able to violate the kcbs@xmath25 inequality .",
    "this way eve does not gain optimal information about the encryption key .",
    "furthermore , if alice and bob are not able to achieve the algebraic maximum , they can detect the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "one strategy that eve can adopt is to intercept the state , perform her own measurements on it and then transmit it onward to bob . in this scenario ,",
    "when she has no information on the state sent by alice , it is best for her to make her measurements randomly .",
    "although this is not the most general attack , we analyze the error rate of bob and information gained by eve for this case .",
    "first we consider the error rate of bob , which we call @xmath52 , caused by the presence of eve .",
    "next we will consider the information gained by eve , which we call @xmath53 .",
    "the error rate of bob can be calculated by analyzing the cases when alice and bob successfully share the key , but due to eve s interference do not get the correct outcomes .",
    "if alice transmits the state @xmath54 , the only cases when the transmission can be termed successful is when bob measures @xmath30 , @xmath54 or @xmath28 , where @xmath17 and @xmath33 are taken modulo 5 .",
    "all other cases are discarded according to the protocol .",
    "eve can intercept the state and perform her own measurement on it by randomly choosing one of the five projectors from the kcbs graph .",
    "the cases in which bob can get an error can be analyzed and are presented in table  [ tab : error ] for the case when alice sends the state @xmath55 . since she is going to choose her state randomly from one of the five possibilities available to her , symmetry ensures that the probability structure is the same for the other cases .",
    ".probability of error in bob s outcome when alice transmits the state @xmath55 and he performs a measurement in context of the state .",
    "the cases corresponding to different states by alice and measurement settings by bob can be analyzed similarly . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,<,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "the cryptography protocol we presented is a direct application of the simplest known test of contextuality namely the kcbs inequality and the related monogamy relations . for the protocol to work ,",
    "alice and bob try to achieve the maximum possible anti - correlations amongst themselves . by doing so",
    ", they achieve the algebraic maximum of the kcbs inequality and then the monogamy ensures that eve s capacity to gain information is limited .",
    "any eavesdropper can gain information about the key only when making measurements in the context of alice , but doing so results in loss in correlations between alice and bob , which can then be detected .",
    "our protocol has several advantages over well established protocols such as bb84 .",
    "the error rate of bob in our protocol is negligible , and concurrently , the information gained by an eavesdropper is bounded from above by 12.6% . furthermore , the eavesdropper can be detected if alice and bob do not achieve the algebraic maximum of the kcbs inequality .",
    "the reason the protocol functions so well is due to quantum contextuality monogamy .",
    "only measurements made in context of each other are allowed , and this reduces the set of measurements that an eavesdropper can perform without disturbance . by increasing the number of contexts , i.e. , using an n - cycle graph ( n @xmath56 5 ) , the error rate and information gained can be further lowered .",
    "however , the key rate will also be affected .",
    "finally , we note that our protocol is a consequence of contextuality monogamy relations , which are expected to play an interesting role in quantum information processing .",
