    "a planar map is a finite connected ( multi)graph drawn on the two - dimensional sphere and viewed up to orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere .",
    "the faces of a planar map are the connected components of the complement of edges , and the degree of a face counts the number of edges in its boundary , with the special convention that if both sides of an edge are incident to the same face then this edge is counted twice in the degree of this face .",
    "important special cases of planar maps are triangulations , where all faces have degree three , and quadrangulations , where all faces have degree four .",
    "it is usual to deal with rooted planar maps , meaning that there is a distinguished edge , which is also oriented and whose origin is called the root vertex .    much recent work has been devoted to understanding the asymptotic properties of large planar maps chosen uniformly at random in a particular class , e.g. the class of all triangulations , or of all quadrangulations , with a fixed number @xmath0 of faces tending to infinity .",
    "there are two basic kinds of limit theorems giving information about large random planar maps .    first",
    ", local limit theorems consider for every fixed integer @xmath3 the combinatorial ball of radius @xmath4 in the planar map ( this is the new planar map obtained by keeping only those faces whose boundary contains at least one vertex whose graph distance from the root vertex is smaller than @xmath4 ) , and show that this ball converges in distribution as the size of the map tends to infinity towards the corresponding ball in a random infinite planar lattice .",
    "such local limits were studied first in the case of triangulations by angel and schramm @xcite and the limiting object is called the uniform infinite planar triangulation ( uipt ) . the analogous result for quadrangulations",
    "was obtained later by krikun @xcite ( see also chassaing and durhuus @xcite and mnard @xcite ) , leading to the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation ( uipq ) .    secondly",
    ", scaling limits consist in looking at the vertex set of a planar map with @xmath0 faces as a metric space for the graph distance rescaled by the factor @xmath2 , and studying the convergence of this metric space when @xmath0 tends to infinity , in the sense of the gromov - hausdorff distance familiar to geometers .",
    "the factor @xmath2 is chosen so that the diameter of the rescaled planar map remains bounded in probability : it was first noticed by chassaing and schaeffer @xcite that the diameter of a random quadrangulation with @xmath0 faces is of order @xmath5 , and a similar result holds for much more general random planar maps , including triangulations .",
    "the existence of a scaling limit for ( uniformly distributed ) random quadrangulations was obtained recently in the papers @xcite , leading to a limiting random compact metric space called the brownian map . in @xcite , it is also proved that the brownian map is the universal scaling limit of more general random planar maps including triangulations .",
    "our main goal in the present work is to provide a connection between the preceding limit theorems , by introducing a random ( non - compact ) metric space called the brownian plane , which can be viewed either as the scaling limit of the uipq or as the gromov - hausdorff tangent cone in distribution of the brownian map at its root .",
    "the brownian plane can also be obtained as the limit of rescaled random quadrangulations with @xmath0 faces if the graph distance is multiplied by a factor @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "let us give a precise definition of the brownian plane before stating our main results .",
    "we consider two independent three - dimensional bessel processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 started from @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite for basic facts about bessel processes ) .",
    "we then define a process @xmath12 indexed by the real line , by setting @xmath13 then , for every @xmath14 , we set @xmath15\\qquad&\\hbox{if } st\\geq 0,\\\\ \\noalign{\\smallskip } ( -\\infty , s\\wedge t ] \\cup [ s\\vee t,\\infty)\\qquad&\\hbox{if } st < 0 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath16 we define a random pseudo - distance on @xmath17 by @xmath18 and put @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",
    "the quotient space @xmath21 equipped with @xmath22 is a ( non - compact ) random real tree , which is sometimes called the infinite brownian tree .",

    "we simply write @xmath49 for this equivalence class , and use the notation @xmath50 for the brownian plane viewed as a pointed metric space ( recall that a metric space @xmath51 is said to be pointed if there is a distinguished point @xmath52 ) .    in order to state our first result",
    ", we introduce the notation @xmath53 for the brownian map , as defined in the introduction of @xcite or in @xcite for instance .",
    "recall that @xmath54 is obtained as a quotient set of aldous crt @xcite , and that in this construction , the brownian map comes with a distinguished point , which is the equivalence class of the root @xmath55 of the crt .",
    "we will abuse notation and also write @xmath55 for the equivalence class of @xmath55 in @xmath54 . from our perspective , it will be important to view the brownian map as a triplet @xmath56 , which is a ( random ) pointed compact metric space .",
    "note that , in a sense that can be made precise , @xmath55 is uniformly distributed over @xmath54 .    for every @xmath57 ,",
    "let @xmath58 be the closed ball of radius @xmath59 centered at @xmath49 in @xmath60 , and let @xmath61 be the closed ball of radius @xmath59 centered at @xmath55 in @xmath54 .",
    "each of these balls is pointed at its center and thus viewed as a pointed metric space .",
    "[ tangentcone ] for every @xmath62 , we can find @xmath57 and construct on the same probability space copies of the brownian plane @xmath63 and of the brownian map @xmath64 , in such a way that the balls @xmath58 and @xmath61 are isometric with probability at least @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath66 in distribution for the local gromov - hausdorff topology .",
    "let us briefly discuss the local gromov - hausdorff topology ( for more details see chapter 8.1 in @xcite and section 2 below ) .",
    "first recall that a metric space @xmath51 is called a length space if , for every @xmath67 , the distance @xmath68 coincides with the infimum of the lengths of continuous curves connecting @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "we also say that @xmath51 is boundedly compact if all closed balls are compact .",
    "then a sequence @xmath71 of pointed boundedly compact length spaces is said to converge to @xmath72 in the local gromov - hausdorff topology if , for every @xmath73 , the closed ball of radius @xmath4 centered at @xmath74 in @xmath75 converges to the closed ball of radius @xmath4 centered at @xmath76 in @xmath77 , for the usual gromov - hausdorff distance between pointed compact metric spaces .",
    "the space of all pointed boundedly compact length spaces ( modulo isometries ) can be equipped with a metric which is compatible with the preceding notion of convergence , and is then separable and complete for this metric .",
    "the convergence in theorem [ tangentcone ] is just the usual convergence in distribution for random variables with values in a polish space .",
    "if @xmath51 is a boundedly compact length space and @xmath52 , the gromov - hausdorff tangent cone of @xmath51 at @xmath76 , if it exists , is the limit in the local gromov - hausdorff topology of the rescaled spaces @xmath78 when @xmath79 tends to infinity ( see section 8.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the convergence ( [ d0 ] ) can thus be interpreted by saying that the brownian plane is the gromov - hausdorff tangent cone in distribution of the brownian map at its root .",
    "it follows from the convergence ( [ d0 ] ) that the brownian plane is scale invariant , meaning that , for every @xmath80 , @xmath81 has the same distribution as @xmath82 .",
    "this can also be verified directly from the definition , using the similar property for the infinite brownian tree .    in order to state our second theorem ,",
    "let us write @xmath83 for the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation and @xmath84 for the vertex set of @xmath83 .",
    "the root vertex of @xmath83 is denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , for every integer @xmath86 , @xmath87 stands for a uniformly distributed rooted quadrangulation with @xmath0 faces , @xmath88 is the vertex set of @xmath87 and @xmath89 is the root vertex of @xmath87 .",

    "@xmath97 ) by a pointed boundedly compact length space , in such a way that the balls centered at the distinguished point in @xmath96 and in this approximating space are within gromov - hausdorff distance @xmath98 ( and a similar result holds for the balls in @xmath97 ) . the convergences ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d1 ] ) make sense , and will indeed be proved for these approximating length spaces .     and",
    "[ scaling - limit].,width=396 ]    the convergences in theorems [ tangentcone ] and [ scaling - limit ] , as well as the convergence of rescaled finite quadrangulations to the brownian map and the local convergence to the uipq , are summarized in the diagram of figure 1 .",
    "the proofs of both theorems [ tangentcone ] and [ scaling - limit ] are based on coupling methods .",
    "the coupling argument already appears in the first statement of theorem [ tangentcone ] , which is in fact much stronger than the local gromov - hausdorff convergence ( [ d0 ] ) . in the discrete",
    "setting , we prove in proposition [ compmap ] that we can couple @xmath99 with @xmath100 so that the balls of radius @xmath101 are the same with high probability .",
    "this allows us to partially answer a question of krikun on separating cycles in the uipq ( see corollary [ krikunconjec ] ) .",
    "the coupling result given in theorem [ tangentcone ] makes it possible to derive several important properties of the brownian plane from known results about the brownian map . in section 5",
    ", we prove that the brownian plane has dimension @xmath102 and is homeomorphic to the plane .",
    "we also study geodesic rays in the brownian plane ( a geodesic ray is a semi - infinite path converging to infinity whose restriction to any finite interval is a geodesic ) .",
    "we prove in particular that any two geodesic rays coalesce in finite time , a property that is reminiscent of the results derived in @xcite for the brownian map and in @xcite for the uipq . as a corollary of our study of geodesics",
    ", we also show that the `` labels '' @xmath103 can be interpreted as measuring relative distances in @xmath104 from the point at infinity , in the sense that , a.s . for every @xmath105 , @xmath106 where the limit holds when @xmath107 tends to the point at infinity in the alexandroff compactification of @xmath104 .",
    "this should be compared to theorem 2 in @xcite . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that , even if the brownian map and the brownian plane share many important properties , the brownian plane enjoys the additional scale invariance property , which may play a significant role in future investigations of these ( still mysterious ) random objects .",
    "finally , we conjecture that the convergence ( [ d2 ] ) in theorem [ scaling - limit ] still holds if the uipq @xmath83 is replaced by the uipt , and more generally that this convergence can be extended to many infinite random lattices that are obtained as local limits of random planar maps .",
