    "an observational program of a small sample of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) has been carried out with bepposax with the aim to investigate the broad band x  ray spectral and variability properties of these objects . the capabilities of the bepposax detectors , and especially the relatively large mecs effective area at high energy ( @xmath0 5 kev ) , have been fully exploited to further investigate , with respect to previous rosat and asca observations , several of the distinctive properties of nls1s . more specifically , we want to test whether the 210 kev spectral index distribution and the properties of the iron k ",
    "shell features in the 610 kev region are different from those of normal , broad  line seyfert 1s ( bls1s ) .",
    "in addition , the broad energy range covered by the bepposax lecs ( 0.14 kev ) , mecs ( 210 kev ) , and pds ( 13100 kev ) detectors will be used to constrain the overall shape of the x  ray continuum and in particular the strength of the soft excess component and the nature of the 1 kev absorption / emission features reported in several asca observations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper , a summary of the most important results obtained by bepposax",
    "are presented and discussed .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the x  ray observations complemented by optical and uv data for some sources can be found elsewhere : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the bepposax nls1 core program includes some of the brightest and most variable objects previously observed by rosat and/or asca ( table 1 ) .",
    "we have also considered the optically selected quasar pg  1115 + 407 , observed in a different bepposax program , since its optical and x  ray properties satisfy the nls1 definition .",
    "all datasets were analyzed in a uniform way using the standard data reduction techniques described in @xcite .",
    "all objects have been clearly detected by the imaging lecs and mecs detectors , while only two positive detections ( pks  0558@xmath1504 and pg  1115 + 407 ) are found in the pds instrument .",
    "unfortunately , in both cases the spectrum above 10 kev is poorly constrained .",
    "for pks  0558@xmath1504 , the pds data are consistent with the extrapolation of the 210 kev spectrum .",
    "a spectral flattening seems to be present in pg  1115 + 407 which may be due to contaminating sources in the field of view @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath2 units of 10@xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5    @xmath6 units of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath5 ;",
    "@xmath8 = 50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath9=0    @xmath10 3 observations merged",
    "substantial flux variability ( up to a factor of 2 ) in both the soft and hard x  ray bands is detected in all sources except rej  1034 + 396 on timescales of the order of a few thousands of seconds , confirming the temporal behaviour established by rosat @xcite and asca @xcite , @xcite observations .",
    "the analysis of hardness ",
    "ratio light curves indicates the lack of significant spectral variability @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of extremely rapid ( doubling time of about 800 s ) soft x  ray variability in the rosat observation of iras  13224@xmath13809 @xcite , several intensive monitoring programs of a few nls1s have been successfully carried out with the rosat hri , allowing a better sampling of the light curves .",
    "several episodes of rapid soft x  ray variability with extremely high amplitude ( up to a factor of 5060 ) have been detected in iras  13224@xmath13809 @xcite , phl 1092 @xcite and pks  0558@xmath1504 @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects and/or obscuration by thick matter with a small covering factor have been proposed ( see brandt , this volume ) .",
    "the bepposax 210 kev light curve of the rapidly variable nls1 iras 13224@xmath13809 ( fig .",
    "1 ) indicates that relatively rapid high amplitude variability is also present at high energies .",
    "unfortunately the faint x  ray state and the short exposure time do not allow a more detailed analysis and a comparison between soft and hard x  ray light curves .",
    "the search for iron k@xmath11 emission lines gave positive results , although at different levels of significance , in 3 objects : ton  s  180 @xcite , ark  564 @xcite and pg  1115 + 407 @xcite .",
    "the best fit energy centroid , significantly higher than 6.4 kev ( between 6.7 and 7 kev ) , and the observed equivalent widths of the order of 500 ev in ton  s  180 and pg  1115 + 407 , strongly suggest emission from highly ionized gas .",
    "there is no evidence of line  like features in the other objects but it should be noted that the signal to noise at high energies is rather poor . the lack of line emission in the good quality spectrum of the radio  loud quasar pks  0558@xmath1504 can be explained assuming a substantial contribution from the non  thermal component .",
    "the residuals of a single power law fit to the high energy spectrum of ark  564 suggest the presence of an edge  like feature at e@xmath0 8 kev in addition to the ionized iron line ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the best fit energy and optical depth of the absorption edge are consistent with those recently reported from the analysis of simultaneous asca and rxte observations @xcite .",
    "the presence of emission lines and absorption edges originating in a highly ionized environment seems to be a distinctive property of the bepposax nls1 sample . in this respect",
    "it is worth noting the tentative detection ( 2@xmath12 ) of a line  like excess at about 6.7 kev in the asca spectrum of re  j1034 + 396 @xcite .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of the line properties is obtained if they are produced in the surface layers of a strongly ionized accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the lecs plus mecs data of all sources have been fitted with various models leaving the relative normalizations free to vary in order to take into account residual intercalibration systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "a single component model never provides an acceptable fit to the 0.110 kev continuum .",
    "the residuals of a single power law fit to the iras  13349@xmath132438 spectrum ( fig .  3 )",
    "are representative of the typical behaviour observed in the bepposax nls1 sample and clearly illustrate the need for at least two components .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters , assuming galactic absorption and neglecting the high energy emission / absorption features , are summarized in table 3 together with the corresponding unabsorbed luminosities in the 0.12 and 210 kev bands .",
    "even though the soft x  ray flux is always larger than that in the hard x ",
    "rays , there is a relatively wide range in the shape and intensity of the soft excess component .",
    "the high energy tail of blackbody emission provides a good description of the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum for 5 ( out of 7 ) objects .",
    "not surprisingly , the strongest soft excesses ( last column of table 3 ) correspond to the highest temperatures and an additional blackbody component is required to fit the lowest energy ( below 0.30.4 kev ) part of the spectrum in re  j1034 + 396 and ark  564 .",
    "the double blackbody mimics a multitemperature optically thick disc model .",
    "if this is the case , the fitted range of temperatures would imply small black hole masses .",
    "a broken power law model is preferred for the radio  loud quasar pks  0558@xmath1504 and for ton  s  180 . in the former case the x  ray emission mechanism",
    "is probably different and likely to be related to the radio properties . in the latter , the overall energy distribution peaks in the far ultraviolet @xcite suggesting a lower accretion disc temperature and thus a negligible contribution in the x  ray band .",

    "the nature of these features is still not well understood .",
    "if the absorption edges are due to oxygen ( the primary source of opacity in photoionized gas ) , the observed energies would imply relativistic outflows ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "alternatively , a blend of resonance absorption lines in a highly ionized gas @xcite could provide a viable explanation .",
    "for some values of the ionization parameter , the accretion disc reflection spectrum is rich in emission lines @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that the 1 kev emission features in ton  s  180 and ark  564 are due to a blend of such lines @xcite and/or to o viii recombination continuum emission @xcite .",
    "there is no convincing evidence of emission lines and/or absorption edges in any of the 0.12 kev bepposax spectra when the best fit models of table 3 are adopted ( e.g. fig .  4 ) .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy with the asca results is likely to be due both to the different energy resolution and spectral coverage of the detectors onboard asca and bepposax .    in order to check whether the relatively weak emission line detected by asca could have been missed by the bepposax lecs ,",
    "a simulated 100 ksec bepposax observation of ark  564 was produced with the best fit asca parameters quoted by @xcite .",
    "given that the simulated spectrum is well described by the best fit model of table 3 , it turns out that weak soft x  ray emission features can hardly be studied with bepposax . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of sensitivity of the asca instruments below @xmath36 0.6 kev coupled with the calibration uncertainties at these energies , prevent a detailed modeling of the soft x  ray continuum and of the strength of any emission / absorption features .",
    "an emission line at @xmath36 1 kev is still statistically required if the asca spectrum is fitted with a blackbody plus power law model ; however the derived line ew is about a factor of 2 lower than that obtained without a blackbody component .",
    "the present results fit fairly well with the hypothesis of a higher accretion rate relative to the eddington rate in nls1s with respect to bls1s .",
    "if the energy conversion efficiency is the same , nls1s should have smaller black hole masses and a correspondingly higher accretion disc temperature .",
    "the steep soft excess and the good fit obtained with thermal components are explained by a shift of the accretion disc spectrum in the soft x  ray band , while the rapid variability is naturally accounted for by the small black hole mass .",
    "the strong soft excess could lead to a strong compton cooling of the hot corona electrons and thus to a steep hard tail . in some models",
    "the disc surface layers become strongly ionized when the accretion rate approaches the eddington limit , which fits nicely with the detection of ionized iron k@xmath11 lines in a few objects .",
    "finally the optical line width is inversely proportional to @xmath37 if the broad line region is virialized and its radius is a function of luminosity alone @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the observation of ionized lines implies that reprocessing is occurring at some level ; however , the strong soft component can not be due to disc reprocessing alone unless the primary emission is highly anisotropic or the high energy spectrum extends up to the mev region without any cut  off .",
    "unfortunately the bepposax sensitivity at high energies is not good enough to measure the shape of the high energy spectrum especially for steep spectrum sources , and sensitive x ",
    "ray observations of nls1s at e@xmath0 10 kev are not foreseen in the near future",
