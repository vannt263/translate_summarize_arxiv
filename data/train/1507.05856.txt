    "in a general way , there are at least two different and competitive approaches in the treatment of nuclear matter .",
    "one of them is based on nucleon - nucleon interactions , from which many - nucleon microscopic relativistic / nonrelativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf )  @xcite calculations are performed to obtain information regarding the entire nuclear system .",
    "these calculations depend on the chosen nucleon - nucleon potential , classified as phenomenological ( reid , urbana and argonne interactions , for instance ) or theoretical one - boson exchange ones ( paris , bonn and nijmegen interactions , for instance ) . for a short review , see ref .",
    "such nucleon - nucleon interactions reproduce experimental data on phase - shifts and deuteron properties and are implemented in complicated many - nucleon bhf codes in order to obtain nuclear matter properties .",
    "alternatively , a second ( macroscopic ) approach does not use nucleon - nucleon interaction itself .",
    "this is the case of nonrelativistic mean - field models like skyrme  @xcite and gogny  @xcite ones . in relativistic framework , on the other hand , the most used models are the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) walecka model  @xcite , and its improved versions  @xcite .    in both approaches ,",
    "many of the models and approximations used are intrinsically related to the fact that an analytical expression for the nucleon - nucleon potential is unknown .",
    "therefore , in a theoretical point of view , correlations between two or more observables acquire enormous importance due to the fact that they reduce the set of independent relevant quantities to be used in the construction of nuclear models , avoiding redundant free - parameter fittings . in an experimental point of view , on the other hand , a correlation between two observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for instance , allows the complete knowledge of @xmath10 if @xmath9 is experimentally well constrained .    in the few - body nuclear physics , for example , the tjon line  @xcite , establishes a correlation between the binding energies of @xmath11 and triton , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the parametrization of the numerical results for several two - nucleon potentials  @xcite concludes that such a correlation reads roughly @xmath14 , in mev units .",
    "it means that , if @xmath13 is calculated by using a two nucleon - nucleon potential , the value of @xmath12 is predicted , even before any four - nucleon calculation .",
    "concerning correlations among bulk parameters , there are still a few of them well established in the literature .",
    "one of them , usually known as the coester line  @xcite , correlates the saturation density @xmath15 and the nuclear matter binding energy @xmath16 .",
    "it was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a two - nucleon model interaction , by varying its tensor force contribution while keeping the deuteron binding energy fixed .",
    "they showed that the function @xmath17 roughly follows a line , in fact a band , also observing its similarity with the curve constructed from @xmath16 and @xmath15 obtained from distinct two - nucleon potentials .",
    "even modern calculations using brueckner - hartree - fock , and including single - particle contribution in the continuum , change the results but preserve the coester line .",
    "another correlation was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and involves the relationship between finite nuclei spin - orbit splittings and the ratio @xmath18 for a class of finite - range ( fr ) rmf models , being @xmath19 the nucleon dirac effective mass at @xmath20 and @xmath21 the nucleon rest mass . the authors showed that such splittings are experimentally well reproduced if the range for @xmath22 is constrained to the following inequality , @xmath23 we will refer the above relation extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite as the frs constraint .",
    "it is important because it relates bulk infinite nuclear matter calculation with the closed shell finite nuclei energy spectrum . still regarding relationships among quantities of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter",
    ", we also point out the correlation between the neutron skin thickness in @xmath24 , and the liquid - to - solid transition density in neutron - rich matter , investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite with rmf models .    in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "we have provided analytical expressions linearly correlating the symmetry energy ( @xmath3 ) , its slope ( @xmath4 ) and curvature ( @xmath5 ) at the saturation density in the framework of the nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit of nonlinear point - coupling ( nlpc ) versions of the boguta - bodmer models  @xcite ( models presenting cubic and quartic self - interactions in the scalar field @xmath8 ) . from such analytical correlations",
    ", we were able to predict ranges for @xmath4 that boguta - bodmer models must present in order furnish good values for finite nuclei spin - orbit splittings . in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the arising of correlations among bulk parameters of infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature in nonrelativistic and relativistic hadronic mean - field models .",
    "for the former , we choose some skyrme and gogny parametrizations as well as the nr limit of nlpc models . for the latter , we choose models , specially the boguta - bodmer ones , and show the conditions to be satisfied in order to their bulk parameters present correlations .",
    "in particular , we show , in a general way , how linear correlations are connected with crossing points in the density dependence of bulk parameters . for this purpose , we generalize the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors associated the crossing point in the incompressibility function for different nonrelativistic skyrme models , but not for ones , with the linear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( incompressibility and skewness coefficient at @xmath15 , respectively ) .",

    "@xcite , for different bulk parameters in nonrelativistic models , as well as in relativistic ones . in the following",
