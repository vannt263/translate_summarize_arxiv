    "i have been asked to review the early days of the photon structure functions and to summarize the present status of this field .",
    "i have worked actively on deep inelastic proton and photon structure functions @xcite from 1977 to 1981 , but , after summarizing the status of perturbative qcd at the photon - lepton symposium in bonn in 1981 , i moved to study technicolour models , flavour physics , weak , cp - violating and rare decays of k - and b - mesons , supersymmetry , extra dimensions , little higgs and petite unification . returning in 2005 to photon structure functions , after being decoupled from this field for 24 years , was a very interesting experience .",
    "one should realize that in 1981 no experimental data on photon structure function @xmath0 were available , although the theory had reached already a rather advanced stage .",
    "i felt like a person returning from a long journey to the earth .",
    "my main question was whether predictions for @xmath0 , in which i took part mainly in the second half of 1978 , have been confirmed by the future data .",
    "i will give the answer to this question at the end of this writing .",
    "the story begins in the early 1970 s , when brodsky , kinoshita , terezawa ( 1971 ) , walsh ( 1971 ) , walsh and zerwas ( february 1973 ) and kingsley ( may 1973 ) analyzed the deep inelastic scattering of a highly virtual photon @xmath1 on a real @xmath2 photon target as seen in fig .",
    "if the photon behaved only as a vector meson , the corresponding structure function @xmath3 would exhibit @xmath4 and bjorken @xmath5 dependences similar to the one of the proton structure function @xmath6 . but as pointed out by walsh and zerwas @xcite , at very large @xmath4 the point - like contribution to @xmath3 , represented by the box diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , should dominate over the hadronic component . evaluating this box diagram",
    "they found @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 being quark charges .",
    "i have introduced a scale @xmath10 for convenience and the non - logarithmic terms in ( [ p1 ] ) can be found in the original paper .",
    "= 1.7 in    the most important results in ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) are :    * @xmath3 _ increases _ at fixed @xmath5 logarithmically with @xmath4 as opposed to the corresponding _ decrease _ ( at not too small @xmath5 ) observed for @xmath6 .",
    "* the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath3 at large @xmath4 is fully calculable as opposed to @xmath6 , where only the @xmath4 dependence ( scaling violations ) can be predicted within renormalization group improved perturbation theory but the actual shape of @xmath6 at a given @xmath4 can only be found by means of non - perturbative methods or directly from the data .",
    "the simple parton model result of walsh and zerwas has been generalized by witten ( 1976 ) @xcite to qcd in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lo ) .",
    "the nlo corrections to witten s result have been calculated two years later by bardeen and myself ( 1978 ) @xcite but the complete nnlo contributions have been presented for the first time only at this conference @xcite , that is 27 years later .",
    "the master formula for the moments of @xmath3 in qcd reads as follows @xcite : @xmath11 , \\label{p3}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where n=2,3 , .. , @xmath12 is the qed structure constant , @xmath13 is the qcd structure constant and @xmath14 the famous lo @xmath15-function coefficient for which gross , politzer and wilczek received the nobel - prize last year @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that    * @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be calculated in perturbation theory and correspond to lo , nlo and nnlo for @xmath19 , respectively . *",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 in the last sum are uncalculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "they can be calculated in the vector dominance model or in principle by means of lattice methods .",
    "they can also be extracted from the data . * as @xmath21 , for very large @xmath4 the first two terms dominate , except for one of @xmath22",
    "for which @xmath23 and the @xmath4 independent piece from the last sum in ( [ p3 ] ) has to be added to @xmath24 .",
    "let us recall the basic formula for the moments of the proton structure function : @xmath25    here @xmath26 denote the wilson coefficients ( calculable in rg improved perturbation theory ) of the local operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( quark non - singlet , quark singlet , gluon ) and @xmath30 the corresponding non - perturbative matrix elements between the proton states .    as pointed out by witten @xcite , in the case of @xmath0 , an additional operator , @xmath31 , the analog of the gluon operator @xmath29 with the non - abelian field strength tensor @xmath32 replaced by the electromagnetic tensor @xmath33 , has to be taken into account .",
    "the reason is that , although the wilson coefficients @xmath34 are @xmath35 , the matrix elements @xmath36 are @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 contribution to @xmath0 is of the same order in @xmath12 as the contribution of quark and gluon operators .",
    "the latter have wilson coefficients @xmath37 , but matrix elements in photon states @xmath35 .    explicitly : @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    including only lo contributions witten found @xmath41 thus for very large @xmath4 the logarithmic behaviour in @xmath4 found by walsh and zerwas in the simple parton model remains valid in qcd as expected .",
    "however , what witten found is that the coefficients @xmath16 of the leading logarithm differ from the moments of @xmath42 in ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "the anomalous behaviour of @xmath3 in qcd can be traced back to the non - vanishing anomalous dimension matrix in the space of the operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , known already from proton deep inelastic scattering and from the anomalous dimension @xmath43 , describing the mixing of @xmath31 and @xmath29 , under renormalization . setting all these anomalous dimensions to zero and keeping only the mixing of @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath31 ,",
    "witten s result reduces to the one of walsh and zerwas : the _ anomalous behaviour _ of photon structure functions originates in certain non - vanishing _",
    "anomalous _ dimensions .",
    "witten s result has been rederived by llewellyn smith ( 1978 ) using a diagrammatic method and by dewitt et al.(1979 ) and brodsky et al .",
    "( 1978 ) in the framework of the altarelli - parisi approach ( dglap ) .    in summary",
    "the most important two results of witten s paper are the following ones :    * the coefficient of @xmath44 is calculable in qcd .",
    "that is @xmath3 is calculable in qcd at large @xmath4 . *",
    "it differs from the free parton model result by finite calculable factors .",
    "in particular for @xmath5 approaching 1 the increase of @xmath3 with @xmath5 , observed also in qcd at moderate @xmath5 , turns into a decrease as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     in the parton model @xcite ,",
    "qcd at lo @xcite and nlo @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   in the parton model @xcite , qcd at lo @xcite and nlo @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]",
    "my own work in this field has been triggered by the visit of jonathan rosner to fermilab in the summer of 1978 .",
    "jonathan wanted to know more about witten s paper and i explained it to him in the manner presented above .",
    "but on 24th of september 1978 i realized that witten s result could be generalized to nlo without doing a single feynman diagram calculation .",
    "one had only to translate the elements of the nlo analysis for @xmath6 into those for @xmath3 .",
    "a complete nlo analysis of @xmath6 has been presented for the first time in june 1978 in a work in collaboration with bardeen , duke and muta @xcite .",
    "it included the earlier result for two - loop anomalous dimension matrix involving @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of floratos , ross and sachrajda ( 1977,1978 ) .",
    "thus in the fall of 1978 it was indeed possible without too much work to generalize witten s result to nlo .",
    "i was truly delighted , when bill bardeen agreed to join me in our second project @xcite .",
    "the main virtues of our work , that provided the constants @xmath17 in ( [ p3 ] ) in qcd were the following ones :    * having @xmath17 at hand , a meaningful determination of @xmath45 or @xmath46 @xcite from @xmath3 became possible . in view of the calculability of @xmath3 at large @xmath4 , the prospects for the determination of @xmath45 from @xmath3 appeared at least in principle better than from @xmath6 .",
    "we will return to it at the end of this writing .",
    "* improved accuracy for the prediction of the shape of @xmath3 in qcd .",
    "* identification of large nlo corrections for large @xmath47 or equivalently large @xmath5 , that made the turn over in the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath3 stronger than at lo as seen in fig  [ fig2 ] . * first comments on the divergent behaviour of the point - like component for @xmath48 that has been analyzed by many other authors in the 1980 s .    in the following years",
    "our result has been confirmed by many groups , in particular by duke and owens @xcite , glck , grassie and reya @xcite and others , but in 1991 fontannaz and pilon @xcite and indepently glck , reya and vogt @xcite spotted a small error in our translation from the mixing @xmath49 relevant for @xmath6 to the mixing @xmath50 relevant for @xmath3 .",
    "this was a very stupid error but fortunately without essentially any numerical consequence for @xmath3",
    ". a visible impact on the gluon distribution in the photon has been however identified .",
    "there is certainly no space to describe here in an adequate manner the developments after 1978 .",
    "selected reviews can be found in @xcite .",
    "let me then list only a few points :    on the theoretical side :    * the evolution equations for quark and gluon distributions in the photon have been studied by brodsky et al ( 1978 ) , glck , grassie and reya ( 1983 ) , rossi ( 1983 ) , drees ( 1983 ) and others .",
    "see additional references below . *",
    "the issue of the singular behaviour for @xmath48 has been addressed in several papers by duke and owens , bardeen , glck , grassie and reya , rossi , antoniadis , grunberg and others .",
    "in particular the non - perturbative component has been used as a regulator . * as stressed in particular by glck , reya and vogt ( 1991 ) @xcite , the mellin n - moment technique for the study of the @xmath4-evolution of @xmath3 and of quark and gluon distributions in the photon is technically superior to the bjorken - x space technique developed earlier by glck and reya , rossi , drees , da luz vieira , storrow and others . in particular @xmath52-counting problems can be straightforwardly avoided . * a large number of parametrizations of parton distributions including heavy flavours",
    "have been proposed .",
    "compilations of these parametrizations ( more than 25 in total ) can be found in @xcite . here",
    "the group of marysia krawczyk is among the leading groups .",
    "the most recent efforts in these directions can be found in @xcite , where numerous references to earlier literature can be found . *",
    "the nnlo corrections have been recently completed @xcite .",
    "i am told that they are small but we have to wait until the numerical analysis of these corrections has been published .",
    "while definitely a significant progress on the study of the implications of the witten s and our calculations has been done since 1978 , the main progress in this field has been done by experimentalists .",
    "after the first measurements of @xmath3 by the cello collaboration in 1983 there was a dramatic progress in collecting data made by pluto , jade , tasso , topaz , amy , delphi , l3 , aleph , opal and tpc/2 .",
    "the relevant references can be found in @xcite . as a result of these efforts @xmath3 and the quark distributions @xmath53 are quite well known at present , while the gluon distribution @xmath54 is still poorly known .",
    "the ranges in @xmath5 and @xmath4 explored so far are very impressive @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let us finally ask whether the @xmath44 and @xmath5-dependences of the point - like component predicted in 1970 s have been confirmed by the data .",
    "the answer is given in fig .",
    "indeed the increase of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath5 and @xmath4 is clearly visible .",
    "a more detailed analysis also shows that for @xmath57 the turn over predicted by qcd becomes visible but more data is required to expose this feature clearly .",
    "on the other hand the present data on @xmath3 allow already now a rather precise determination of @xmath45 .",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath58 in a very good agreement with the world average @xmath59 the accuracy could be further improved at the nlc and a photon collider .    in summary ,",
    "the photon structure functions predicted by qcd agree well with the data , even if further studies are clearly desirable .",
    "it became a mature field and definitely there is more to come in the next 25 years .",
    "as i am now returning back to flavour physics , weak decays and cp violation i wish all explorers of the physics of photon structure functions good luck !",
    "i would like to thank marysia krawczyk for inviting me to this so well organized and very interesting symposium .",
    "the six days i spent in warsaw , in particular the piano concertos in the warsaw philharmony , will remain in my memory forever .",
