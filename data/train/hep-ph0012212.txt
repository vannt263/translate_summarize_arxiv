    "the vertex involving the coupling of two gluons and @xmath1-meson @xmath6 ( here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the virtualities of the two gluons ) enters in a number of production and decay processes .",
    "for example , the inclusive decays @xmath9  @xcite and exclusive decays @xmath10  @xcite , involve , apart from the matrix elements of the four - quark operators , the transitions @xmath11 , followed by @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13 followed by @xmath14  @xcite , as well as the transitions @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "thus , a reliable determination of the vertex function ( which can also be termed as the gluonic transition form factor ) @xmath6 is an essential input in a quantitative understanding of these and related decays .",
    "apart from the mentioned @xmath17-decays , the @xmath18 vertex plays a role in a large number of processes , among them the radiative decay @xmath19 and the hadronic production processes @xmath20 , where  @xmath21 is a nucleon .",
    "the qcd axial anomaly  @xcite , responsible for the bulk of the @xmath1-meson mass , normalizes the vertex function on the gluon mass - shell , yielding @xmath22 . the question that still remains concerns the determination of the vertex for arbitrary time - like and space - like virtualities , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 .",
    "a related aspect is to understand the relation between the @xmath0 vertex and the wave - function of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "stated differently , issues such as the transverse momenta of the partons in the @xmath1-meson and their impact on the @xmath0 vertex have to be studied quantitatively .",
    "while information on the @xmath0 vertex is at present both indirect and scarce , its electromagnetic counterpart involving the coupling of two photons and the @xmath1-meson , @xmath25 , more generally the meson - photon transition form factor , has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "in particular , the hard scattering approach to transition form factors , developed by brodsky and lepage @xcite , has been extensively used in studying perturbative qcd effects and in making detailed comparison with data  @xcite .",
    "a variation of the hard scattering approach , in which transverse degrees of freedom are included in the form of sudakov effects in transition form factors  @xcite , has also been employed in data analyses .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the sudakov effects improve the applicability of perturbative qcd methods down to moderate values of  @xmath26 and give a better account of data on meson - photon transitions @xcite . for a critical review and comparison of the standard ( brodsky - lepage ) and modified ( mhsa ) hard scattering approaches ,",
    "see refs .",
    "we note that either of these approaches combined with data constrains the input wave - function for the quark - antiquark part of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "however , the gluonic part of the @xmath1-meson wave - function is not directly measured in these experiments and will be better constrained in future experiments sensitive to the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "a closely related issue is that of the @xmath27 mixing .",
    "there exist good theoretical  @xcite and phenomenological  @xcite reasons to suspect that the frequently assumed pattern of the decay constants @xmath28 , defined by the equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the su(3)@xmath32 octet and singlet axial - vector currents , respectively , do not follow the pattern of state mixing . defining the decay constants as  @xcite @xmath33 the angles @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 are found to differ considerably due to non - negligible su(3)@xmath32-breaking effects @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is natural to expect that the state mixing is determined essentially by a single angle , as the state @xmath36 is far too heavy to be significant in the state - mixing in the @xmath27 complex .",
    "a growing consensus is now emerging in favor of the two mixing - angle scheme of leutwyler  @xcite for the decay constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leutwyler - mix ] )  @xcite . to be precise",
    ", we shall use the state - mixing scheme of feldmann , kroll and stech  @xcite , which is consistent with the two mixing - angle scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite in the current - mixing basis .",
    "based on the foregoing discussion , it is natural to use the hard scattering approach to study the @xmath0 vertex , incorporating the information on the wave - function and the mixing parameters entering in the @xmath27 complex from existing data involving the electromagnetic transitions . a first step in this direction",
    "was undertaken recently by muta and yang  @xcite .",
    "they derived the @xmath37 vertex in the time - like region in terms of the quark - antiquark and gluonic parts of the @xmath1-meson wave - function , taking into account the evolution equations obeyed by these partonic components  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also address the same issue along very similar lines .",
    "we first rederive the @xmath37 vertex , pointing out the agreement and differences between our results and the ones in ref .",
    "the latter have to do with the derivation of the leading order perturbative contribution to the gluonic part of the @xmath37 vertex , and the use by muta and yang  @xcite of the anomalous dimensions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the evolution of the wave - functions . for the anomalous dimensions",
    ", we use now , correcting a similar mistake in the earlier version of this paper , the results derived in refs .  @xcite , which are at variance with the ones given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but which have been recently confirmed by belitsky and mller  @xcite .",
    "making use of the @xmath2 data to constrain the @xmath1-meson wave - function parameters , we find that the gluonic contribution in the @xmath1-meson is very significant .",
    "we then extend our analysis to the case when both the gluons are virtual , having either the time - like or space - like virtualities .",
    "we also present a number of results on the vertex function @xmath6 in the asymptotic region , which have not been presented earlier to the best of our knowledge , and are of use in future theoretical analysis , in particular in the @xmath3 and @xmath38 transitions .",
    "we study the effects of the transverse momentum distribution involving the constituents of the @xmath1-meson and take into account soft - gluon emission from the constituent partons by including the qcd sudakov factor , following techniques _",
    "en vogue _ in studies of the electromagnetic and transition form factors of the mesons  @xcite .",
    "we show the improvements in the @xmath18 vertex function due to the inclusion of the transverse - momentum and sudakov effects , which are particularly marked in the space - like region , improving the applicability of the hard scattering approach to low values of @xmath26 .",
    "these effects have a bearing on the hard scattering approach to exclusive non - leptonic decays  @xcite ; the importance of the transverse - momentum and sudakov effects in the decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 has also been recently emphasized in ref .",
    "finally , we also derive approximate formulae for the @xmath18 vertex , which satisfy the axial - vector anomaly result for on - shell gluons and the asymptotic behavior in the large-@xmath26 domain , determined by perturbative qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : eta - wf ] , we specify the @xmath27 mixing formalism and the evolution equations for the  @xmath41 and gluonic wave - functions of the @xmath1-meson . in section  [ sec : quark - contrib ] , the  @xmath41 contribution to the off - shell @xmath0 vertex is worked out in the hard scattering approach .",

    "<S> we study the @xmath0 vertex for arbitrary gluon virtualities in the time - like and space - like regions , using the perturbative qcd hard scattering approach and an input wave - function of the @xmath1-meson consistent with the measured @xmath2 transition form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the gluonic content of the @xmath1-meson is taken into account , enhancing the form factor over the entire virtuality considered . </S>",
    "<S> however , data on the electromagnetic transition form factor of the @xmath1-meson is not sufficient to quantify the gluonic enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effect of the transverse momenta of the partons in the @xmath1-meson on the @xmath0 vertex , using the modified hard scattering approach based on sudakov formalism , and contrast the results with the ones in the standard hard scattering approach in which such effects are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions for the @xmath0 vertex are presented in limiting kinematic regions and parametrizations are given satisfying the qcd anomaly , for real gluons , and perturbative qcd behavior for large gluon virtualities , in both the time - like and space - like regions . </S>",
    "<S> our results have implications for the inclusive decay @xmath3 and exclusive decays , such as @xmath4 , and in hadronic production processes @xmath5 . </S>"
