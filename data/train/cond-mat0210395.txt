    "since its original discovery , carbon nanotubes@xcite have received a great deal of attention due to fundamental physical interest on nano - scale systems , as well as due to nanotubes@xmath3 potential for useful industrial applications @xcite . a very important recent advance has been the fabrication of high - purity crystalline bundles of nearly mono - disperse single wall carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "this allows better experimental control and produces accurate data .",
    "it also provides opportunities and points to new directions for theoretical analysis of swnt .",
    "so far , the electronic and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have been extensively investigated while there also exist several new measurements of thermal properties of these systems@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present our theoretical and numerical analysis of thermal conductance of swnt .    of particular interest to this work",
    "is the recent experimental measurements of thermal conductance of nanotubes @xmath2@xcite .",
    "this quantity describes the thermal current induced by a temperature gradient , and  we will analyze a two - terminal measurement of it . hence , maintaining temperatures at the left and right lead to be @xmath4 respectively , @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thermal current flowing through the nanotube .",
    "the experimentally measured thermal conductance of carbon nanotubes indicates that the most essential contribution comes from phonons@xcite .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "@xcite on aligned multiwall nanotubes suggested that at low temperature up to @xmath8 @xmath2 can be well fit by quadratic form in @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the measurements@xcite of specific heat @xmath11 , which is proportional to @xmath2 , also showed a power law dependence , however with a power larger than unity but slightly less than two@xcite .",
    "finally , measurements on crystalline ropes of swnt indicates@xcite a linear temperature dependence up to @xmath12 and an upward bend near @xmath13 on the @xmath2 versus @xmath9 curve @xcite . how to interpret these experimental observations presents a challenge to theory . indeed ,",
    "although there exist a vast literature on theoretical analysis of thermal transport of both electrons and phonons in the context of mesoscopic physics@xcite , direct investigation on carbon nanotubes is rare@xcite .",
    "the precise temperature power law in thermal conductance of nanotubes is expected to depend on , among other things , the detailed phonon dispersion . in this work",
    "we will calculate the dispersion for several swnt and investigate its consequence .",
    "we neglect electrons as their contribution to @xmath5 of nanotubes can only be observed at temperature less than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "our analysis of swnt is based on the tersoff - brenner@xmath15s empirical potential@xcite for carbon to calculate the phonon dispersion .",
    "we then apply a landauer - buttiker - type formalism to compute the lattice thermal conductance in various swnts , for which the thermal transmission coefficient is assumed to take a breit - wigner form .",
    "the predicted @xmath2 shows a quadratic form in temperature for both zigzag and armchair swnt .",
    "using one experimental data to fix an overall shift of @xmath5 , our predicted @xmath2 is consistent with the experimental data of ref.@xcite as the tube - tube interactions are so weak that we could compare our calculations for single wall carbon tubes with the experimental results on multiwall tubes . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the tube - tube interactions are also weak , the measured @xmath2 is linear below @xmath13 and shows an upward bend slightly near @xmath13 , i.e. the curve appears to be also parabolic - like from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "when the carbon - carbon bond length is slightly varied , our results indicate that @xmath5 does not change qualitatively , implying that the anharmonic effect does not alter its qualitative behavior .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we outline the analysis of phonon dispersion and @xmath2 .",
    "section iii presents the numerical data while a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we start by writing down a multi - probe formula for thermal current transmission in the same spirit as the familiar landauer - buttiker formula @xcite for electron transport .",
    "as discussed above we neglect contributions from electrons and deal with the lattice vibration as a phonon gas . the thermal current is therefore driven by a temperature gradient and carried by phonons from the probe to another .",
    "the thermal current can be written as    @xmath18 where @xmath19 label the leads , @xmath20 is the planck constant , @xmath21 is the phonon energy , and @xmath22 is the phonon distribution function with temperature @xmath23 at lead @xmath24",
    ". the thermal transmission function @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the scattering matrix for phonons .",
    "eqs.(1,2 ) are similar to the landauer - buttiker formula @xcite for electron transport .",
    "let the energy of the @xmath28-th branch of phonon be @xmath29 .",
    "the thermal current can be rewritten as @xmath30 or @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the group velocity .",
    "for the special case of two probe measurement in one dimension , one can easily confirm that eq.(4 ) is reduced to the form which has been used to study the quantized thermal conductance of dielectric quantum wires @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the frequency and the velocity of normal mode @xmath28 of the wire with wave vector @xmath36 , respectively , @xmath37 is the phonon transmission probability through the wire , and @xmath38 is the phonon distribution function at the right or left lead indicated by @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "we refer interested readers to refs.@xcite for more details about the present formulation . for the swnt the thermal conductance , @xmath41 ,",
    "can be numerically computed through the following form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the temperature difference between the two leads , @xmath44 is the length of the swnt , and @xmath45 is the maximum of phonon modes in swcns , which was investigated elsewhere@xcite .    to proceed , it is clear that the phonon frequencies of swnt at @xmath46 point and the transmission function @xmath47 are required .",
    "there are a number of methods which can be applied to obtain the phonon frequencies , and we will present our calculation of this quantity in the next section . on the other hand ,",
    "it is rather complicated to accurately determine the phonon transmission function . for a perfect infinite harmonic lattice",
    "the thermal conductivity diverges because every mode transmits perfectly .",
    "the contacts play an important role as in case of electron transport . even for perfect phonon transmission ,",
    "the thermal conductance is finite due to the contact resistance .",
    "defects , boundary scatterings , phonon - phonon interactions and other scattering mechanisms in the conductor inevitably introduce thermal resistances .",
    "the transmission function @xmath47 is contributed by lattice imperfection and conductor boundary , and the anharmonic effect due to interactions can be included in terms of the renormalized temperature - dependent dispersion relation .",
    "to obtain @xmath47 for swnt one should in principle solve the scattering of a phonon wave by the atoms of the nanotube which is a nontrivial problem not solved so far .",
    "however if the length of a conductor is much larger than its cross - section size , @xmath47 can be approximately obtained by solving linear elastic equations assuming the conductor to be an uniform elastic medium@xcite . in 1d ,",
    "the continuum mechanics results indicate@xcite that @xmath48 is dominated by sharp resonances reminiscent of a resonance transmission of phonon modes : @xmath49 at resonant energies and sharply becomes much smaller for other energies .",
    "guided by this observation and for simplicity of analysis , we shall investigate the consequence of such a resonance transmission of phonon modes for carbon nanotubes by parameterizing @xmath50 into a breit - wigner form ,    @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the width of the resonance and position of a resonance .",
    "both of these parameters are closely related to the effects of defects and boundary scatterings .",
    "furthermore , instead of directly considering  anharmonic effects , we will investigate its consequence by simply varying the carbon - carbon bond length to observe how much the thermal conductance can vary .",
    "to calculate the phonon spectra @xmath54 at the @xmath46 point for armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes , we shall make use of the tersoff - brenner empirical potentia@xcite for carbon .",
    "although this empirical potential only gives an approximation to the vibration frequency of nanotubes , it does capture the basic and qualitative characteristics of their phonon spectra .",
    "tersoff - brenner@xmath3s potential is also numerically efficient to allow investigations of large systems which is required for our study .",
    "the parameters for this potential have been determined before and there are two sets of them which have been widely used @xcite for structure analysis of carbon : @xmath55 the meaning of the symbols refers to ref.@xcite .",
    "we have checked that for swnt the second set of brenner@xmath15s parameters gave results closer to those obtained by using tersoff parameter@xcite .",
    "we shall use in our calculations the second set values shown in the table .",
    "in addition , experimental measurements have shown that phonon modes of swnt have frequencies up to @xmath56 .",
    "we have numerically confirmed that if the equilibrium distance parameter @xmath57 , which is a value in between the first and second brenners@xmath15s parameter sets ( see table ) , the obtained vibration frequencies at @xmath46 point is consistent with experimental data@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , all the parameter sets give similar total binding energy .",
    "for instance , for the armchair ( 4,4 ) nanotube , the binding energy per atom is found to be -6.8920 , -7.0881 , -6.9993 and -7.0456 ev using tersoff@xmath3s potential , the first brenner@xmath3s potential , the second brenner@xmath3s potential and our modified second brenner@xmath3s potential , respectively .",
    "1 presents a comparison between these empirical potentials . in all subsequent numerical analysis",
    "we shall utilize the revised value of @xmath58 .",
    "the lattice vibration frequencies of the swcn at @xmath46 point can be obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wave vector , the perturbation of @xmath61 is taken to be @xmath62 , and @xmath63 once the phonon modes are obtained , we are able to calculate thermal conductance by eq .",
    "( 6 ) . here",
    "we would like to point out that although there have been a number of studies dedicated to the lattice vibrations of carbon nanotubes so far@xcite , it is not suitable for us to adopt directly the phonon data in literature .",
    "this is because in our situation we need frequency data for different sizes of carbon nanotubes as well as the data of frequencies when the carbon - carbon bond length is simply varied in order to retrieve the anharmonic effects . in principle",
    ", we can use ab initio molecular dynamics method to get the frequencies if the system is not too big .",
    "since in the present case the system contains hundreds of atoms , it is not easy to obtain useful data on the basis of ab initio simulations , and for a practical purpose it is better to invoke an empirical potential to compute the phonon spectra of swncs with larger sizes .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we are investigating long swcns such that the left end is at temperature @xmath64 and the right end is at temperature @xmath65 let us first consider the basic characteristic of @xmath2 . at very low temperatures where only the massless modes ( i.e. @xmath66 ) are relevant ,",
    "@xmath67 is simply a constant independent of temperature . at slightly higher temperature , the high frequency modes set in because a swnt is a quasi - one dimensional system in which each unit cell contains so many atoms that there are many modes with nonzero cutoff frequencies .",
    "therefore @xmath67 will deviate from the constant behavior when temperature is increased .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows the temperature dependence of thermal conductance for the armchair ( 11,11 ) and the zigzag ( 11,0 ) carbon nanotubes when the transmission is perfect , _",
    "i.e. , _ by setting @xmath68 for all the phonon modes . for these cases",
    "our results indicate that @xmath2 increases , approximately , in a parabolic fashion as a function of temperature .",
    "we found that anharmonic effect has only a slight influence on the temperature dependence of @xmath2 , and this is shown by calculating @xmath2 for different values of carbon - carbon bond length which generates different phonon spectra at the @xmath46 point .",
    "2 shows @xmath5 for three different bond lengths 1.42 , 1.44  and 1.46 for a zigzag ( 11,0 ) system .",
    "this result clearly shows that the basic shape of @xmath2 is not changed qualitatively by varying the bond length .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 is however dependent on bond length as expected : the longer the bond length the lower the thermal conductance value .    in a real swnt system",
    "the flow of thermal current is not perfect due to scattering of phonons by various lattice imperfections .",
    "it is thus inevitable that @xmath69 in general and only at resonances@xcite do we have @xmath68 [ see eq . ( 7 ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the transmission resonances are sharp for a large number of modes , which is the case shown by previous numerical calculations for various one - dimensional wires@xcite , we do not expect qualitative changes of behavior from that shown in fig .",
    "2 . on the other hand , it is interesting to examine the opposite situation , namely the transmission is dominated by a single resonance , _",
    "i.e. _  the transmission coefficient @xmath70 is centered at a single mode @xmath53 with a resonance width @xmath52 [ see eq.(7 ) ] .",
    "therefore for a small @xmath52 only very few terms in the summation of eq.(6 ) have substantial contribution to @xmath2 , while a large @xmath52 should give a similar result as those of fig .",
    "3 shows this behavior for a number of values of @xmath52 by fixing @xmath71 for simplicity .",
    "indeed , a large @xmath52 which essentially gives @xmath68 for a wide range of modes , gives a parabolic temperature dependence for @xmath2 . for small values of @xmath52 , on the other hand ,",
    "not only the value of @xmath72 is reduced because only a few modes contribute , but also the temperature dependence changes qualitatively .",
    "this exercise indicates the importance of the quality of phonon wave transmission .",
    "recently the thermal conductance of the carbon nanotubes has been experimentally measured@xcite . in both experiments ,",
    "the results show clearly that the tube - tube interactions are quite weak , implying that it would be reasonable at some extent that is also capable of comparing the measured results for multi - wall carbon nanotubes with the calculated ones for single wall tubes without generating qualitative deviations , as it indeed is .",
    "our result is found to be qualitatively consistent with the experimental data @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "4 where the circles are the measured data and the dotted and dashed lines are our calculated results .",
    "the solid line is a least square fit to the experimental data in the range of @xmath73 to @xmath74 which gives @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "hence the experimental data indicate a parabolic dependence on temperature .",
    "surprisingly , our calculated value of @xmath72 is even quantitatively reasonable considering the various approximation used in our analysis : since the lorentz number @xmath77 , the size of nanotube is on the order of @xmath78 and at @xmath79 our calculated @xmath80 in units of lorenz number ( _ e.g_. fig .",
    "2 ) , gives the same order of magnitudes in magnitude as the measured data .",
    "to plot our calculated curves in fig .",
    "4 , we have used one experimental data point at @xmath81 to fix the scale of @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that for both zigzag and armchair tubes , the predicted curves qualitatively agree with the measured data quite reasonably .  in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measured @xmath2 is linear below 30k and an upward bend slightly near 30k , i.e. the curve appears also to be parabolic - like from 8k to 100k .",
    "the linear dependence below 30k in ref.@xcite may be the results of particular phonon scattering mechanisms or the imperfection phonon transmission . as a result",
    ", our results appear to suggest that the thermal transport in nanotubes might primarily be mediated by lattice vibrations , and the electron contribution is less important .",
    "we have studied the properties of the thermal conductance of single - walled carbon nanotubes by means of a landauer - buttiker - like thermal conductance formalism using a modified tersoff - brenner potential .",
    "we found that the thermal conductance of the swcn increases almost parabolically with increasing temperature at perfect transmission at low temperature .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent and quantitatively on the same order of magnitude as the measured data@xcite because the tube - tube interactions in these carbon nanotubes are weak .",
    "this allows us to suggest that in the experimental device the phonon transmission is quite ideal , which is consistent with the fact that the high quality of the nanotubes@xcite was ensured in the measurements .",
    "it also suggests that it is the phonon contribution which gave , to a large extent , the observed behavior of temperature dependence of the thermal transport in swcns .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that the anharmonic contribution to the thermal conductance of swcn is only quantitative but not qualitative .",
    "although the simple analysis presented in this paper has given a qualitative understanding of the experimental data of ref.@xcite , a number of further improvements to theory are desirable .",
    "an extremely difficult subject is the calculation of phonon transmission function for carbon nanotubes .",
    "our choice in this work is the phenomenological breit - wigner formula motivated by one - dimensional theory of linear elasticity . for realistic nanotube devices , especially those with lattice imperfections",
    ", it will be useful to accurately compute the transmission coefficient .",
    "another improvement to the present work involves a more accurate analysis of the phonon frequency , perhaps from first principle methods . finally , since experimental measurements are usually performed for a bundle of carbon nanotubes , if the tube - tube interaction is not weak it is also interesting to investigate the effect of inclusion of tube - tube interactions@xcite .",
