    "the derivation of a consistent theory of _ relativistic _ fluid dynamics has been a challenge for some time .",
    "the difficulty resides in the parabolic nature of navier - stokes theory , which allows signals to propagate with infinite speed . while in non - relativistic theories",
    "this unphysical feature can be dismissed , in relativistic systems it leads to unstable equations of motion and is simply unacceptable @xcite .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition is that the equations of motion are hyperbolic .    for relativistic dilute gases",
    ", the boltzmann equation provides a reasonable description of the underlying microscopic theory and can serve as a starting point to investigate the microscopic foundations of fluid dynamics . for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we consider a single - component system of massless and classical particles interacting only via elastic two - body collisions with a constant cross section @xmath0 .",
    "the relativistic boltzmann equation for this type of system reads @xmath1where @xmath2 is the single - particle distribution function , @xmath3 is the lorentz - invariant transition rate , and @xmath4 $ ] is the lorentz - invariant momentum - space volume , with @xmath5 being the number of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the right - hand side of the boltzmann equation describes the change of the single - particle distribution function due to elastic collisions of two particles with incoming momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and outgoing momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the conservation laws follow from the first two moments of the boltzmann equation as a consequence of the conservation of particle number and energy - momentum in individual collisions , @xmath10 .",
    "the particle four - current , @xmath11 , and the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath12 , can be cast in the usual form,@xmath13where @xmath14 is the particle number density , @xmath15 is the particle diffusion four - current , @xmath16 is the energy density , @xmath17 is the fluid four - velocity defined in the landau frame @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the thermodynamic pressure , and @xmath20 is the shear - stress tensor .",
    "since we consider a massless gas , the bulk viscous pressure is always zero .",
    "the additional equations needed in order to solve the conservation laws , i.e. , the equations of motion for @xmath15 and @xmath20 , must be derived by properly matching fluid dynamics to the relativistic boltzmann equation .    in the framework of relativistic kinetic theory ,",
    "israel and stewart were among the first to derive a relativistic theory of fluid dynamics that is causal and stable @xcite . in the israel - stewart (",
    "is ) formulation , the single - particle distribution function is expanded around its local equilibrium value in terms of a series of lorentz tensors formed of particle four - momentum @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 . in order to derive fluid dynamics",
    ", this series is truncated at second order in momentum , i.e. , one only keeps the tensors @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , the so - called 14-moment approximation .",
    "the 14 coefficients of this truncated expansion are uniquely matched to the 14 components of @xmath25 and @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the equations of motion for @xmath15 and @xmath20 are obtained by substituting the truncated moment expansion into the second moment of the boltzmann equation .    in the past five years , is theory has been widely applied to ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions in order to describe the time evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the freeze - out of the hadron resonance gas appearing in the late stages of the collision . however , in heavy - ion collisions extreme conditions occur which question the validity of fluid dynamics .",
    "the qgp created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and , recently , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is not only the fluid with the smallest space - time extension ( @xmath26 fm ) ever created in nature but also the one where the space - time gradients of the fluid fields , for instance energy density @xmath16 , are the largest ( @xmath27fm ) ever encountered . on the other hand",
    ", israel and stewart s derivation lacks a small parameter , such as the knudsen number , with which one can do power counting and systematically improve the approximation to describe higher - order gradients .",
    "thus , the applicability of is theory to the extreme conditions reached in heavy - ion collisions is , at the very least , not clear .",
    "one way to investigate the applicability of is theory is to compare the solutions of this theory with numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "so far , it was confirmed that , at least for some special problems , the is equations @xcite are not in good agreement with the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation . in these cases , it was shown by some of the present authors @xcite that the is formalism seems to be unable to describe heat flow , even when the knudsen number is very small . in this paper , we would like to explain the reason for this discrepancy and propose a solution which works at least if the knudsen is not too large .",
    "recently , a systematic derivation of fluid dynamics from the boltzmann equation was introduced in ref .",
    "the main difference between is theory and the theory derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the latter does not truncate the moment expansion of the single - particle distribution function .",
    "instead , dynamical equations for all its moments are considered and solved by separating the slowest microscopic time scale from the faster ones .",
    "then , the resulting fluid - dynamical equations are truncated according to a systematic power - counting scheme using the inverse reynolds number @xmath28 and the knudsen number @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the mean free - path and @xmath31 a characteristic macroscopic distance scale , e.g. @xmath32 .",
    "the values of the transport coefficients of fluid dynamics are obtained by resumming the contributions from all moments of the single - particle distribution function , similar to what happens in the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite .    in this paper , we review the basic aspects of this resummed transient relativistic fluid - dynamical theory ( rtrfd ) .",
    "we explicitly derive the equations of motion of rtrfd including terms up to second order in the knudsen number .",
    "we then demonstrate that this method is also able to handle problems with strong initial gradients in pressure or particle number density .",
    "this resolves the previously observed differences between the solution of is theory and of the boltzmann equation @xcite mentioned above .",
    "we conclude that these differences were caused by the uncontrolled truncation procedure of the expansion of the single - particle distribution function in terms of lorentz tensors in four - momentum as employed in is theory .",

    "mb , the thermodynamic pressure and shear - stress tensor computed in all fluid - dynamical theories are in good agreement with the numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation . as we decrease the cross section we expect the agreement between macroscopic and microscopic theory to become worse .",
    "this explains why , for @xmath234 mb , the pressure and shear - stress tensor computed within fluid - dynamical theories deviate more strongly from those computed via the microscopic theory . nevertheless , compared to the fugacity and heat - flow profiles , the agreement is not too bad , even for the smaller value of the cross section .",
    "the initial pressure gradient in case i drives , via conservation of momentum , the creation of velocity gradients . on the other hand ,",
    "the gradient of fugacity is initially zero and turns out to remain small throughout the evolution . in this situation ,",
    "higher - order terms involving gradients of velocity and of the shear - stress tensor , e.g.  @xmath235 and @xmath236 in the particle diffusion equation ( [ final ] ) , become of the same order as the respective ( first - order ) navier - stokes term @xmath237 .",

    "the parabolic term @xmath238 is either absent ( is theory and rtrfd 13/13 ) or has to be dismissed ( rtrfd 13/37 ) for reasons of causality . in addition , is theory and rtrfd 13/13  do not have the correct value for @xmath239 , because we did not include a sufficiently large number of irreducible moments in its computation .",
    "although rtrfd 13/37  features ( within the desired accuracy ) the correct value for this transport coefficient ( as well as for @xmath240 ) , it does even worse in describing the fugacity and heat - flow profiles than the previous two theories .",
    "this is because the term @xmath238 could not be taken into account for reasons of causality , although it is of the same order of magnitude as the term @xmath241 .",
    "these problems of fluid - dynamical theories with only 13 dynamical variables are resolved by rtrfd 21/37  which is the only fluid - dynamical theory considered here that contains _ all _ contributions of second - order in the knudsen number in a hyperbolic fashion .",

    "the fluid - dynamical theories considered were solved for @xmath244 mb ( shown in the left panels ) and for @xmath233 mb ( shown in the right panels ) .",
    "again , we expect , and see , better agreement between fluid dynamics and the boltzmann equation for the larger value of the cross section .",
    "while the fugacity profiles are in good agreement with the solution of the boltzmann equation for all fluid - dynamical theories and both values of the cross section , the heat flow is not well described in is theory and in rtrfd 13/13 : is theory predicts values for the heat flow which are smaller in magnitude than the boltzmann equation , while rtrfd 13/13  predicts larger values , even for @xmath233 mb . on the other hand , both rtrfd 13/37  and rtrfd 21/37  describe the heat flow very well or even perfectly , respectively , for both values of the cross section .",
    "the reason is that the diffusion coefficient @xmath245 has the correct value in these theories ( while it deviates by @xmath246 in both is theory and rtrfd 13/13 ) .",
    "since , in case ii , the initial pressure gradient is zero and turns out to remain small throughout the evolution , the velocity gradients remain small as well . in this situation , it is important to include higher - order terms that couple the shear - stress tensor to heat flow .",
    "this is the reason why the solutions of is theory and rtrfd `` 13/13 '' ( where these higher - order terms vanish in the massless limit ) are not in good agreement with that of the boltzmann equation for the thermodynamic pressure and the shear - stress tensor , for both values of the cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "rtrfd `` 13/37 '' does a better job in matching the boltzmann equation .",
    "it is not perfect , because the higher - order terms @xmath247 and @xmath248 were dropped .",

    "[ fig : caseiiqp ] the bamps results for the shear - stress tensor are strongly fluctuating .",

    "in this paper , we compared the equations of motion of rtrfd at various levels of approximation with numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation for two different types of initial conditons ( labeled case i and ii ) . also , we showed how to use the rtrfd formalism to derive equations of motion that are hyperbolic and , at the same time , include terms up to second order in the knudsen number . by a careful comparison with numerical solutions of the microscopic theory",
    ", we demonstrated that this formalism is able to handle problems with strong initial gradients in pressure or particle number density .",
    "the initial conditions , cases i and ii , were chosen in such a way that considerably different spatial gradient profiles are generated throughout the fluid - dynamical evolution . in case i , the pressure gradient is initially large which gives rise to large velocity gradients in the later stages of the evolution .",
    "this means that , in case i , the shear - stress tensor is mainly generated by its corresponding navier - stokes term , i.e. , by gradients of velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the fugacity gradient is initially zero in case i , and remains relatively small throughout the evolution of the fluid .",
    "therefore , in case i the heat flow is not mainly created by its navier - stokes term , i.e. , by the gradient of fugacity , but by the coupling term to the shear tensor and shear - stress tensor , i.e. , the terms @xmath252 and @xmath253 in eqs .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case the higher - order terms in knudsen number must be included and one really needs to solve the hyperbolic equations derived in this paper to obtain a good agreement .",
    "the fact that is theory is always deviating from the microscopic theory when it concerns heat flow means that it does not predict correctly the terms of order one and two in knudsen number . on the other hand , in rtrfd 13/37  and",
    "rtrfd 21/37  all transport coefficients are computed with a sufficiently large number of irreducible moments .",
    "this guarantees that all terms of the desired order are included and is the reason for the better agreement of these fluid - dynamical theories with the microscopic theory .",
    "the reason why rtrfd 13/37  fails in certain situations is that important terms have to be neglected in order to preserve hyperbolicity and causality .    in case",
    "ii , the fugacity gradient is initially large while the pressure gradient is zero .",
    "this means that the heat flow originates mainly from its navier - stokes term while the shear - tress tensor originates mainly from its coupling to heat flow , i.e. , the terms @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 in eqs .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "the fact that the heat flow calculated from is theory deviates from the solution given by the microscopic theory even in this case , is evidence that the navier - stokes term of this theory does not contain the correct transport coefficient .",
    "the coupling of the shear - stress tensor with the heat flow in is theory is also not correctly taken into account .    in conclusion ,",
    "the resummation of irreducible moments for the computation of the transport coefficients was essential to obtain a good agreement with the microscopic theory .",
    "it provides not only the correct values for the shear viscosity and heat conduction coefficients , but also for the transport coefficients that couple the respective dissipative currents .",
    "moreover , in situations where higher - order terms are important , one has to make sure to include them in a hyperbolic way , and not simply drop relevant contributions because they are parabolic .",
    "these two factors resolved the previously observed differences between the solution of is theory and of the boltzmann equation observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as expected , and explicitly demonstrated in this paper , the agreement between solutions of rtrfd and the boltzmann equation depends on the value of @xmath0 . for the cases considered in this paper",
    ", we obtained a good agreement for @xmath233 mb , while for @xmath232 mb we started to notice small deviations . in order to improve the agreement for smaller values of the cross section",
    ", we would have to include more moments of the boltzmann equation to describe the state of the system , i.e. , such moments would have to contribute not only to the values of the transport coefficients but also as independent dynamical variables .",
