    "magnetars ( e.g. , @xcite ) are considered to be magnetically - powered isolated neutron stars ( nss ) having ultra - strong dipole magnetic fields , @xmath4 g , as derived from their pulse periods @xmath5 and period derivatives @xmath6 .",
    "these values of @xmath7 exceed so - called critical field , @xmath8 g , at which the landau level separations of electrons reach their rest - mass energy .",
    "magnetars emit characteristic two - component x - ray spectra , consisting of the long - observed soft component and the mysterious hard component @xcite .",
    "magnetars are considered to harbor even higher _ toroidal _ ( or internal ) magnetic fields @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these fields may be generated and amplified in the progenitor s core , during its final gravitational collapse involving strong differential rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , some models explain the production of energetic particles in magnetars invoking toroidal magnetic fields and the associated twisted magnetic configuration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , the presence of intense @xmath9 is supported by the recently discovered low-@xmath7 magnetars , sgr 0418 + 5729 @xcite , sgr1822@xmath01606 @xcite , and 3xmm j185246.6 + 003317 @xcite ; their burst activity indicates the presence of internal fields , which are much stronger than the externally observable values of @xmath10 g , @xmath11 g , and @xmath12 g , respectively .",
    "the possible proton cyclotron feature in sgr 0418 + 5729 , which suggests a local surface field of @xmath13 g @xcite , provides another support , because a part of such intense internal fields would emerge from the ns surface to form local multiples .",
    "thus , the strong @xmath9 may be regarded as one of the most important properties of magnetars .",
    "however , it remained difficult to more directly estimate @xmath9 , because toroidal fields are intrinsically confined inside the ns and invisible from outside .",
    "after pioneering suggestions by , e.g. , @xcite , the way around this difficulty was explored by makisihma et al .",
    "( 2014 ; hereafter mea14 ) in the following way .",
    "when an ns has @xmath14 g , is it expected to be deformed into a prolate shape @xcite , to a degree of @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath16 is the moment of inertia around the ns s symmetry axis @xmath17 , and @xmath18 that around axes orthogonal to @xmath17 .",
    "such an ns has a rotation period @xmath19 and a precession period @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular momentum vector",
    ". these two periods , which were degenerate when spherical , thus become different just by @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath17 is tilted from @xmath21 by a non - zero _ wobbling angle _ @xmath23 , the ns is said to exhibit _ free precession _ , which is the most basic behavior of a torque - free rigid body with an axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "this concept should be distinguished from the more familiar _ forced precession _ driven by external torque , as seen in spinning tops .",
    "suppose that a precessing ns has a radiation pattern that breaks axial symmetry around @xmath17 .",
    "then , as argued by mea14 , the observed pulses will be phase - modulated at the beat period between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which is called _ slip period _ and is given as @xmath26 using the suzaku x - ray observatory @xcite , mea14 actually found that the @xmath27 s pulsation of the spectral hard component of the magnetar 4u 0142 + 61 is subject to phase modulation with a period of @xmath28 ks .",
    "when this effect is interpreted as a manifestation of free precession and @xmath29 to be the associated slip period , equation ( [ eq : slip ] ) yields @xmath30 , and hence equation ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) implies @xmath31 g. this provides the first direct estimation of @xmath9 of a magnetar . as seen above , the ssential assumptions made by mea14 to interpret the observed phase modulation are ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the broken axial symmetry of the hard x - ray beam pattern around @xmath17 .",
    "if these assumptions generally hold in objects of this class , we should observe the same effects from other magnetars as well .",
    "if detected from a fair number of them , we can study such important issues as how @xmath9 is distributed among them , whether @xmath7 and @xmath9 are correlated , and whether @xmath9 actually decreases ( as postulated in the magnetar scenario itself ; @xcite ) towards objects with larger characteristic ages .",
    "the results will also provide valuable clues to the origin of the enigmatic hard x - ray component @xcite , to the nature of the intriguing spectral evolution of magnetars discovered by @xcite , and to the ultimate origin of these mysterious objects .",
    "thus , examining other magnetars for the hard x - ray phase modulation is extremely important and urgent .    in the present paper , we have chosen the highly variable magnetar 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 as our 2nd target .",
    "it is the fastest - rotating magnetar with @xmath34 s possibly associated with the supernova remnant g327.24@xmath00.13 @xcite .",
    "the observed value of @xmath35s s@xmath36 , together with @xmath5 , yields @xmath37 g and a characteristic age of @xmath38 kyr . as already reported by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) and @xcite ,",
    "this objects was observed by suzaku during its 2009 january outburst , and yielded by far the strongest hard x - ray ( @xmath39 kev ) signals among some 10 magnetars so far observed with suzaku .",
    "although this source was observed with suzaku again on 2010 august , these data are not utilized here , since the source had faded by that time in hard x - rays to a level comparable to the hxd detection limit @xcite .",
    "as described in paper i and @xcite , the present suzaku observation of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 was performed from 2009 january 28 21:34 ( ut ) to january 29 21:32 ( ut ) .",
    "it was a target - of - opportunity observation , triggered by the onset on january 22 of the strong bursting activity of this source ( gronwall et al .",
    "the gross duration of the observation was thus 86 ks , and the target was placed at the hxd nominal position . among the three operating cameras of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) ,",
    "xis0 was operated in the timing mode ( p - sum mode ) , with a 7.8 ms time resolution .",
    "the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ) was operated in the standard mode , yielding a time resolution of 61@xmath40s .",
    "further details of the observation are found in paper i.    below , we utilize the data from xis0 and hxd - pin , which were processed as described in paper i. those from xis1 and xis3 had too low a time resolution ( 2.0 s ) to resolve the pulsation , and signal statistics were rather low in hxd - gso .",
    "the net exposures achieved with xis0 was 42.6 ks , while that with the hxd was 33.5 ks .",
    "after subtracting the background and applying dead - time corrections , the object was detected with hxd - pin at a 1570 kev count rate of @xmath41 c s@xmath36 ( paper i ) , and a 110 kev rate of @xmath42 c s@xmath36 with xis0 .    as described in paper i , 13 short - burst candidates were removed , and arrival times of the xis0 and hxd - pin events were photon - by - photon converted to those to be measured at the solar - system barycenter .",
    "the conversion utilized the source position of @xmath43 , as well as the spacecraft orbital information .",
    "since the present paper re - analyzes the same data set of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 as used in paper i , let us begin with reproducing the timing results of that publication .",
    "while paper i utilized the conventional chi - square method to search for the pulsations , here we instead employ the @xmath44 technique @xcite which is free from the ambiguity of phase - bin number per pulse cycle . for each trial pulse period @xmath5 ,",
    "this technique calculates the pulse phase @xmath45 of each x - ray photon individually , and plot it on a unit circle at an azimuth @xmath46 . after processing all the photons in this way",
    ", we are left with a photon density distribution on the unit circle .",
    "then , the distribution is fourier transformed with respect to @xmath46 , and the fourier power is summed up to a specified harmonic number @xmath47 ) ; this summation yields the statistical quantity called @xmath44 , which evaluates the significance of periodicity at @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , @xmath44 is just the fourier power , summed up to the @xmath48-th harmonic , of the folded pulse profile .",
    "if no intrinsic periodicity is present at @xmath5 , the @xmath44 value should obey a chi - square distribution with @xmath49 degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  [ fig : periodogram0 ] ( a ) show periodograms calculated in this way using the 210 kev xis0 data and the 1270 kev hxd - pin data , both background - inclusive .",
    "the harmonic number was chosen to be @xmath50 , considering the double - peaked pulse profile of this source ( e.g. , paper i ) .",
    "these energy bands , as well as the trial period range ( 2.07132.0730 s ) , are the same as those in paper i , while the employed period search step , @xmath51 s , is 4 times finer .",
    "the results reconfirm essential features of figure 3 of paper i , including the best - estimate period of @xmath52 referring to the xis result , and the side lobe patterns .",
    "the hxd periodogram peak , though consistent with equation ( [ eq : p0_xis ] ) within errors , is slightly displaced to longer period as @xmath53 this behavior is also seen in figure 3 of paper i. the errors in @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to the range where pulse - phase errors develop to @xmath56 of one pulse cycle when accumulated over the gross duration of 86 ks .",
    "these approximately agree with widths of the peaks in the periodograms .    in figure",
    "[ fig : periodogram0 ] ( a ) , the xis and hxd periodograms both show a number of side lobes . assuming that a side lobe at a period @xmath57 arises due to a beat between the pulsation at @xmath58 ( representing either @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) and a certain longer period @xmath29 , we calculated the required period as @xmath59 , and show it in green at the top of figure  [ fig : periodogram0 ] .",
    "thus , many of the side lobes ( particularly of xis0 ) in figure  [ fig : periodogram0](a ) can be explained as a beat of @xmath58 with @xmath60 ks or @xmath61 ks , which agree with the suzaku s orbital period @xmath62 ks or twice this value , respectively .",
    "however , several hxd - pin side lobes , seen on both sides of @xmath58 , remain unexplained .",
    "these structures are also seen in figure 3 of paper i. we thus infer that the hard x - ray pulses could be affected by some long periodicity in the range of @xmath63 ks ( 5.013.8 hr )",
    ".        since the above range of @xmath29 does not contain particular artificial periodicity of the observation ( e.g. , data gaps or background variations ) , the unexplained hxd side lobes could be of celestial origin rather than instrumental .",
    "specifically , we speculate that the hard x - ray pulsation of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 is phase modulated , like in 4u  0142 + 61 ( mea14 ) , at a certain period @xmath29 in the above range . after mea , we hence assume that the peak timing @xmath64 of each 2.07 s pulse is displaced sinusoidally by @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the amplitude and initial phase of the assumed modulation , respectively .    as in mea14 ,",
    "such effects can be removed by shifting the arrival times of individual hxd photons back by @xmath68 .",
    "we hence applied these time displacements to the individual hxd photons , and re - calculated the @xmath69 periodograms to see whether the pulse significance changes .",
    "the pulse period was scanned over a range of @xmath70 ( with a step @xmath71sec ) , i.e. , the joint error range of equation ( [ eq : p0_xis ] ) and equation ( [ eq : p0_hxd ] ) .",
    "the triplet @xmath72 ) describing the phase modulation was scanned over @xmath73 sec ( with a @xmath74 sec step ) , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 step ) , and @xmath77 ks ( with a step of 0.1 to 0.2 ks ) . in order to maximize the signal statistics ,",
    "the energy range was changed to 1540 kev , while the harmonic number @xmath50 was retained .",
    "the results of this _ demodulation _ analysis are presented in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] , just in the same format as figure 2 of mea14 . there , panel ( a ) shows a two - dimensional color map of the value of @xmath78 ( the maximum as @xmath5 is varied ) obtained on each grid point @xmath79 , for a particular case of @xmath80 ks .",
    "its projections on the @xmath67 and @xmath66 axes are presented in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively , where multiple traces indicate cross sections of panel ( a ) at various positions .",
    "thus , a clear peak is seen at @xmath81 s and @xmath82 , of which the significance reaches @xmath83 ; here , @xmath69 is abbreviated to @xmath84 , and @xmath85 denotes the peak value of @xmath84 found on a @xmath79 plane for a given value of @xmath29 .",
    "panel ( d ) of figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] shows how this @xmath85 depends on the modulation period @xmath29 . over the entire @xmath86 space surveyed ,",
    "the highest value of @xmath84 , to be called the grand - maximum value , is thus found as @xmath87 for a set of modulation parameters given as @xmath88 here , the errors are represented in the same way as mea14 , namely , by the standard deviations of gaussians fitted to the distributions ( above uniform backgrounds ) in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] .",
    "the obtained @xmath89 is considerably higher than @xmath90 which was found before the demodulation as the black peak in figure  [ fig : periodogram0 ] ( b ) and at @xmath91 in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] ( c ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : periodogram0](b ) , the demodulation with equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) has changed the hxd - pin periodogram significantly . there , the _ pre - demodulation _ result is essentially the same as the brown trace in panel ( a ) , except some small differences due to the different energy ranges ( 1270 kev vs. 1540 kev ) .",
    "the peak at @xmath55 has become much higher , from @xmath92 to @xmath89 , and the @xmath93-unrelated side lobes have diminished , because powers therein have been recovered into the main peak . as revealed by",
    "the two folded pulse profiles in figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] ( one before and the other after the demodulation ) , an almost twofold increase of the 1540 kev pulse amplitude underlies this increase in @xmath84 .      although the phase demodulation procedure largely increased the hxd pulse amplitude ( and hence the pulse significance ) , we need to examine whether this increase is statistically significant , or merely due to a chance superposition of poisson noise of the data on the already existing periodicity at @xmath55 .    in terms of chi - square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom",
    ", the chance probability of finding values of @xmath94 of equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) is extremely small , @xmath95 . here",
    ", the subscript specifies the harmonic number @xmath48 , and the superscript  h\"means the hxd .",
    "however , we can not use this face value to evaluate the statistical significance of the detected effect , for the following two reasons .    1 .",
    "this @xmath96 must be multiplied by the total number of _ independent _ trials involved in the computation of figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] , but this quantity is not easy to estimate .",
    "the total number of parameter search steps would considerably overestimate this number , because the steps were chosen , rather arbitrarily , to be fine enough not to miss the @xmath84 peaks .",
    "2 .   when evaluating the significance of @xmath89 , we need to consider the fact that the hxd signals were already pulsing clearly , before the demodulation procedure , at @xmath55 ( paper i ) with @xmath97 .",
    "these two problems can be combined into a single question : when we scan over @xmath5 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath29 , like in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] , what is the overall chance probability for @xmath84 statistics to increase from @xmath92 to @xmath89 _ by chance _ under the absence of any intrinsic modulated at @xmath29 ?    to answer the above inquiry",
    ", we conducted a simulation , using the actual data themselves but purposely randomizing the modulation phase .",
    "as detailed in appendix 1 , we have found that the grand - maximum value @xmath89 , to be found in an analysis which scans over the same @xmath86 space as figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] , would follow a distribution given in figure  [ fig : chance_probability ] , if there were no intrinsic phase modulation at any @xmath29 examined . in panel ( a ) , values exceeding equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) were actually found in three out of the 1,000 simulation runs . to be more quantitative , the associated upper integral probability , shown in panel ( b ) ,",
    "is approximated in the range of @xmath98 by an exponential as @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 was chosen as a reference pivot point .",
    "the value of @xmath103 is consistent with the exponential factor , 2.0 , that is expected for a chi - square distribution of any degree of freedom .",
    "thus , a value of @xmath89 which is equal to or larger than equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) will appear with a chance probability of @xmath104 which agrees with the implication of panel ( a ) .",
    "as noticed in appendix 1 , this estimate is considered rather conservative .",
    "considering that mea14 used @xmath105 , it may be interesting to examine what happens if we employ different values of @xmath48 .",
    "we hence repeated the same analysis with @xmath106 , 3 , and 4 , to find @xmath107 , 47.06 , and 49.92 , respectively .",
    "the optimum parameters were not much different from those in equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) . although the larger harmonic numbers somewhat increased @xmath89 from equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) , the effect is not significant considering the increased degree of freedom .",
    "in fact , the implied chance occurrence probability , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , are all much higher than @xmath96 obtained above , in agreement with the double - peaked pulse profiles .",
    "therefore , we retain @xmath50 below .    in short , we can exclude , at @xmath111 confidence , the possibility that @xmath89 of equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] arised via chance superposition of the hard x - ray pulsation and the photon count fluctuation .",
    "this confidence level is more stringent than the case of 4u 0142 + 61 , which was @xmath112 ( mea14 ) .",
    "the phase - modulation amplitude of equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) , namely @xmath113 , implies that the pulse phase is modulated , through the @xmath114 ks period , nearly by @xmath115 cycle .",
    "can we visually trace this much drift of the pulse peaks and valleys ?",
    "for this purpose , we accumulated the entire 1540 kev hxd - pin events ( background inclusive ) in a two - dimensional array @xmath116 , where the row @xmath117 represents the modulation phase ( i.e. , the photon arrival times modulo @xmath29 ) , while the column @xmath118 the pulse phase ( those modulo @xmath55 ) .",
    "then , @xmath119 represent the pulse profile in the @xmath120-th modulation phase bin . in practice , we chose six modulation - phase bins ( @xmath121 ) and 12 pulse - phase bins ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "since individual pulse profiles derived in this way are rather noisy , they were cross correlated with the demodulated 15 - 40 kev profile ( red in figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] ) which is regarded as the reference .",
    "this is the same procedure as used in mea14 to produce their figure 3 ( a ) .",
    "the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) , calculated by an interpolation method detailed in appendix 2 , are shown in figure  [ fig : ccf ] , where the six modulation phases are specified by colors . in the modulation phases 1 through 4 ,",
    "the ccf thus becomes maximum at about @xmath123 bins ( @xmath124 s ) ahead of the zero - lag , while at @xmath123 bins ( @xmath124 s ) behind zero in the modulation phases 5 through 0 .",
    "while these results are consistent with equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) , the modulation waveform is suggested to be rather _ bimodal _ instead of sinusoidal . in other words , the pulse profile , which is approximately double - peaked ,",
    "is suggested to change as if one of the two peaks is enhances during about a half of the @xmath125 ks period , and the other peak gets stronger in the remaining half .",
    "the above inference from figure  [ fig : ccf ] suggests that the phase modulation is better expressed by a square - wave function , rather than the employed sinusoidal form . to deal with this possibility , we modified equation ( [ eq : modulation ] ) into @xmath126 /\\arctan(\\sigma)~ , \\label{eq : square}\\ ] ] by introducing another parameter @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath128 , this @xmath129 reduces to equation ( [ eq : modulation ] ) , because @xmath130 for @xmath131 . as @xmath132 increases , in contrast , the modulation waveform starts saturating as shown in figure  [ fig : square ] , and approaches a square wave which takes the value of @xmath66 and @xmath133 with 50% duty ratio .",
    "we repeated the same demodulation search as figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] , but employing equation ( [ eq : square ] ) instead of equation ( [ eq : modulation ] ) .",
    "the derived @xmath89 value is plotted in figure  [ fig : square ] ( b ) as a function of @xmath132 .",
    "thus , @xmath89 has indeed increased from @xmath134 to @xmath135 accompanied by a further decrease in the chance occurrence probability of equation ( [ eq : chance ] ) as @xmath136 as seen in figure  [ fig : square ] , the modulation waveform implied by @xmath137 is very close to a square wave .",
    "the best - estimate parameters became @xmath138 which are consistent with equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) except the @xmath139 decrease in the amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "this is understandable , because a sinusoidal wave should have a somewhat larger amplitude if it is used to approximate the effects of a ( nearly ) square wave .",
    "the ccfs ( figure  [ fig : ccf ] ) and the demodulated pulse profiles ( figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] ) suggest that the square - wave - like phase modulation is not exactly symmetric between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , we further assumed a simple square - wave phase modulation , but allowing different duty ratios between @xmath142 and @xmath133 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath89 became even higher than equation ( [ eq : sq_xmax ] ) when the @xmath142 duty ratio is in the range 53 - 61% , with the highest value being @xmath143 at 60% .",
    "more sophisticated modeling of the modulation waveform is left as our future work .",
    "the two - component spectral model fit performed in paper i indicates that the soft thermal component and the hard power - law component of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 cross over at @xmath144 kev .",
    "therefore , the hardest end of the xis energy band , with its p - sum time resolution , is expected to provide independent information on the hard component , and allows us to reconfirm the hxd - pin results .",
    "( this was not feasible with 4u  0142 + 61 , since the xis was not operated in the p - sum mode in that observation . ) to limit the soft - component contribution to @xmath145 , we choose an energy range of 1014 kev , and perform the same analysis as above .",
    "this energy range is actually covered by the xis , but is seldom utilized in spectral studies , mainly because the calibration is uncertain ; such problems do not affect timing studies .    figure  [ fig : demodulation_xis ] show the results of demodulation analysis on the 1014 kev xis0 data , presented in the same way as figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] . panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) al refer to the condition of @xmath80 ks after equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) . on the @xmath79 plane , a clear peak with @xmath146 is seen at a similar position to figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] ( a ) .",
    "more specifically , @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be constrained as @xmath147 these values agree , within errors , with the corresponding results in equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) .",
    "the sinusoidal demodulation with equation ( [ eq : best_para_xis ] ) has effects on the 1014 kev periodograms as shown in figure  [ fig : pg_pr_xis ] ( a ) . while the value of @xmath148 found before the demodulation ( black ) is within random fluctuations , a clear peak , of which the height is given by equation ( [ eq : z2_max_xis ] ) , appeared at a period that is in full agreement with equation ( [ eq : p0_xis ] ) and equation ( [ eq : p0_hxd ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : square ] , the value of @xmath149 further increased to @xmath150 when the xis0 data were demodulated with equation ( [ eq : square ] ) ; thus , the xis0 data also favor a non - sinusoidal case with @xmath151 , in a gross agreement with the hxd results .",
    "blue data in figure  [ fig : pg_pr_xis ] refer to this non - sinusoidal demodulation , assuming @xmath152 , @xmath153 s , @xmath154 , and @xmath80 ks .",
    "figure  [ fig : pg_pr_xis](b ) shows 1014 kev xis0 pulse profiles folded at @xmath54 , presented in the same colors as in figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] .",
    "again , the demodulation procedure significantly increased the pulse fraction .",
    "the red and blue pulse profiles are similar to those in figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] , although the relative depths between the two minima are reversed . for reference ,",
    "110 kev xis0 pulse profile is also shown .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath149 is shown in figure  [ fig : demodulation_xis ] ( d ) .",
    "thus , in addition to a small hump at @xmath155 ks , we observe many other peaks , some being much higher . among them , the sharp features at @xmath61 ks and @xmath156 ks are likely to be caused by background variations , because they are close to @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively : the former peak is seen in figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd](d ) as well .",
    "besides , the plot reveals a much higher peak at @xmath159 ks , which is probably due to a chance superposition of poisson fluctuations on top of the demodulated pulsation . as a result",
    ", we can not claim the presence of the @xmath125 ks periodicity based on the xis data alone .",
    "nevertheless , the xis results significantly reinforce the hxd - detected phase modulation : when the pulsation is insignificant in the raw periodogram [ figure  [ fig : pg_pr_xis ] ( a ) ] , the probability of finding a peak of @xmath160 ( or 34.07 ) , _ at virtually the same point _ in the @xmath86 space as specified by the hxd result , can be evaluated with a simple chi - square distribution to be @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 ) .",
    "now that the 36 ks phase modulation in the hard x - ray pulses , detected with the hxd , has been reinforced by the 1014 kev xis data , our next task is to examine how this phenomenon behaves towards lower energies . in the same way as above",
    ", we therefore analyzed the xis0 data in three lower energies ; 710 kev where the spectral hard component is still dominant , 47 kev where the two spectral components compete , and 14 kev dominated by the soft component .",
    "figure  [ fig : demodulation_softx ] shows the results of this soft x - ray analysis , namely , scans in @xmath66 in which @xmath80 ks is fixed while @xmath67 is allowed to take any value .",
    "thus , the modulation amplitude decreases towards lower energies , and the effect almost disappears in the 14 kev range . combining these with equation ( [ eq : best_para_hxd ] ) and equation ( [ eq : best_para_xis ] ) ,",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath66 is visualized in figure  [ fig : amp_vs_energy ] .",
    "there , the dashed curve represents the fractional contribution of the hard component at that energy , namely @xmath163 where @xmath164 s is a fiducial amplitude at the hardest energy limit , while @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the intensities of the soft and hard components , respectively , according to the spectral decomposition ( model b ) in paper i. interesting enough , this simple empirical formula can very well explain the observed energy dependence of @xmath66 , implying that the phase modulation is limited to the hard x - ray component .    given figure  [ fig : amp_vs_energy ]",
    ", we attempted to divide the 1540 kev hxd - pin band into finer ranges , or to extend the analysis to higher energies beyond 40 kev up to @xmath167 kev .",
    "however , due to limited statistics , the data provided no significant information on the possible energy dependence of the hxd phase modulation .",
    "likewise , the hxd - pin data below 15 kev ( down to  10 kev ) had so poor statistics that they did not allow us to cross confirm the 1014 kev xis results .",
    "all what can be said is that the pulse - phase modulation in the hxd - pin signal is consistent with being energy independent within rather large uncertainties .",
    "finally , the 50100 kev hxd - gso data were analyzed in the same way , but no significant results were obtained .",
    "through an extensive reanalysis of the suzaku data of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 , we have discovered with the hxd , at a 99.6% confidence level , that the 2.07 s hard x - ray pulsation is subject to phase modulation with a period of @xmath125 ks ( figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] ) . following the first detection from 4u 0142 + 61 ( mea14 ) , this makes 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 a 2nd magnetar exhibiting this kind of behavior .      when considering the origin of the detected effect , the most immediate examination to be done is whether it is any instrumental artifact . in this respect , of particular importance",
    "is the cross confirmation with the 1014 kev xis data ( figure  [ fig : demodulation_xis ] ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility of the phase modulation being due to some instrumental origin specific to the hxd .",
    "furthermore , the clear decrease of @xmath66 toward lower energies ( figure  [ fig : amp_vs_energy ] ) rules out any instrumental or artificial origin specific to the overall suzaku mission ( e.g. , unexpectedly large drifts in the spacecraft clock ) , because such effects should be independent of the photon energy .",
    "we are hence left with celestial interpretations .",
    "although we have so far regarded the phase modulation as periodic , the total span of the observation , 86 ks , contains only 2.3 cycles of the 36 ks oscillation .",
    "therefore , the observed phenomenon could be some random fluctuations in the hard x - ray pulse phase ( or in the relative strengths of the two peaks in the pulse profile ; section  [ subsec : non - sinusoidal ] ) , of which the variability power happened to be high at @xmath168 ks . to examine this possibility",
    ", figure  [ fig : demodulation_hxd ] ( d ) is replotted in figure  [ fig : power ] as a function of the wave number @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the peak in @xmath89 is confined to a rather narrow range of @xmath170 , indicating that the variation is essentially _ periodic_.    to strengthen the above inference , superposed on figure  [ fig : power ] is the power spectrum of a square wave that has a period of 36 ks and a positive duty ratio of 65% ( somewhat exaggerated than was found in section  [ subsec : non - sinusoidal ] ) .",
    "even thought there is no _ a - priori _",
    "reason for this power spectrum to agree with the @xmath89 trance , they are surprisingly similar .",
    "the hump at @xmath171 can be regarded as the 2nd harmonic , and its presence supports the non - symmetric square - wave like modulation , because the 2nd harmonic should vanish if the duty ratio is 50% .",
    "thus , the observed effect is unlikely to have originated from any aperiodic variation .",
    "below , let us limit our interpretation to _ periodic _ phase variations .",
    "the simplest of them is binary motion of the magnetar : indeed , @xmath172 s and @xmath125 ks can be explained if the putative companion star has a mass of the order of 0.1 solar mass ( depending on the inclination ) .",
    "however , even putting aside the astrophysical reality of such a binary , the square - wave like property ( figure  [ fig : square ] ) is difficult to explain with this scenario . a more vital counter argument is provided by the absence of the phase modulation in soft x - rays ( figure  [ fig : amp_vs_energy ] ) , like in 4u  0142 + 61 .    from the above arguments ,",
    "free precession remains the most promising possibility ( @xcite ; mea14 ; section 1 ) .",
    "namely , we consider that the ns is deformed to @xmath173 as described by equations ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) and ( [ eq : slip ] ) , that @xmath125 ks is the slip period , and that the ns has an unspecified ( but non - zero ) @xmath23 . below",
    "we adopt this interpretation , and assume a _ prolate _ deformation as in mea14 , although the data do not allow us to distinguish between prolate ( @xmath174 ) and oblate ( @xmath174 ) cases .      from the viewpoint of free precession of an axisymmetric ns ,",
    "let us compare 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 and 4u 0142 + 41 ( mea14 ) .",
    "one important feature common to them is the decrease of the modulation amplitude towards lower energies ; at least in 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 , the effect is consistent with being absent in the soft spectral component .",
    "after mea14 , this can be interpreted in the following way . to begin with",
    ", the pulse period of equation ( [ eq : p0_xis ] ) should be identified with @xmath25 around @xmath21 , rather than with @xmath24 .",
    "next , @xmath17 may be identified with the dipole magnetic axis .",
    "then , if the emission pattern is axi - symmetric around @xmath17 , we can detect only the precession , but not the rotation .",
    "this case applies to the soft component , because this presumably thermal emission from the ns surface should be symmetric around the magnetic axis along which the heat will flow .",
    "if , in contrast , the emission pattern breaks symmetry around @xmath17 , the observed signal would depend both on the direction of @xmath17 as seen from us , and on the ns s rotation angle around @xmath17 relative to the @xmath21-@xmath17 plane .",
    "since this angle changes with the slip period @xmath29 , the pulse phase becomes modulated at @xmath29 ( mea14 ) .",
    "this case can explain the hard x - ray component .    while the two sources show very similar behavior , they also exhibit the following 4 differences , which must be explained if the free precession scenario provides a correct account of the phenomenon .    1 .   while we measured @xmath175 in 4u 0142 + 61",
    ", the ratio is much higher , @xmath176 ( nearly @xmath115 of the pulse cycle ) in 1e 1547.0@xmath045408 in energies above 10 kev ( figure  [ fig : amp_vs_energy ] ) .",
    "the modulation waveform is more squared in 1e 1547.0@xmath045408 ( figure  [ fig : ccf ] , figure  [ fig : square ] ) , in contrast to the case of 4u 0142 + 61 in which it was more sinusoidal as seen in figure 3(a ) of mea14 .",
    "3 .   while @xmath105 was found optimum in 4u 0142 + 61 , @xmath50 is sufficient in 1e 1547.0@xmath045408 .",
    "the hard x - ray pulsation of 4u  0142 + 61 in the 2009 suzaku observation was detected only after the demodulation , whereas that of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 is significant even before such corrections ( paper i ) .",
    "let us consider item no.1 first . in 4u 0142 + 61 , the sinusoidal hard x - ray modulation with @xmath177 was attributed to positional ( or directional ) deviations of the x - ray emission region ( or direction ) from the magnetic poles ( or from @xmath17 ) .",
    "there , the emission pattern was implicitly assumed to be pencil - beam like .",
    "in contrast , the case of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 can be better explained by assuming that the emission reaches us ( for simplicity , from a single pole ) in a _ fan - beam - like _ pattern , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fanbeam ] . the beam will point to us twice per @xmath25 , when the pole appears from the rim of the ns , to be called _ dawn _ , and disappears behind it , namely _",
    "dusk_. this explains the double - peaked pulse profiles ( figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] , figure  [ fig : pg_pr_xis ] ) , and the @xmath178 cycle offset of the hard x - ray pulse peaks from that in the soft x - rays [ figure[fig : pg_pr_xis ] ( b ) ] . as in figure",
    "[ fig : fanbeam ] , we may further assume that the fan - beam emission pattern is asymmetric around @xmath17 , so that dusk is brighter than dawn at a certain time ( left in figure  [ fig : fanbeam ] ) . in about @xmath179 ,",
    "the dawn and dusk intensities will reverse ( right in figure  [ fig : fanbeam ] ) , producing seesaw like behavior between the two hard x - ray peaks .",
    "thus , the brightest pulse peak will switch rather discretely between @xmath180 and @xmath181 cycles , as described by equation ( [ eq : square ] ) .",
    "this configuration explains items no.2 .    how about the remaining items no.3 and no.4 ?",
    "in the 2009 data of 4u 0142 + 61 , the hard x - ray pulse profile was richer in fine structures , consisting of three peaks separated by a quarter cycle [ figure 1 ( f ) of mea14 ] .",
    "this is considered to be the reason why @xmath105 was needed .",
    "this , together with the rather sinusoidal phase modulation , is thought to have strongly smeared out the pulsation of 4u 0142 + 61 , and made it difficult to detect without demodulation at least in the 2009 suzaku observation .",
    "in contrast , the pulse profiles of the present source are basically double - peaked , for which @xmath50 is considered appropriate . in addition , the rather discrete phase modulation in this object is considered to have much less smeared out the original pulse profiles .",
    "these considerations explain no.3 and no.4 in a natural manner .",
    "so far , a fair number of reports have been made on possible detections of precession from nss , including accretion - powered objects @xcite and rapidly rotating nss ( e.g , @xcite ) . however , as discussed in mea14 , such a behavior in accretion - powered systems should be regarded as forced precession , because of the strong accretion torque .",
    "the fast - rotating nss can exhibit free precession , because they must be deformed into oblate shapes by centrifugal force .",
    "however , the precession would be damped on rather short time scales @xcite , because an oblate body attains its minimum energy at @xmath182 under a constant @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the reports remain controversial .",
    "in contrast to these ordinary nss , magnetars are expected to more ubiquitously exhibit the free precession , because their strong @xmath9 will deform them into prolate shapes @xcite ; their centrifugal deformation ( oblate ) is negligible , e.g. , @xmath183 , because of their rather long pulse periods , @xmath184 s. in such a prolate magnetar , the free precession will spontaneously develop , because any internal energy dissipation , with @xmath21 conserved , will increase @xmath23 .",
    "( as mentioned in mea14 , decay in @xmath23 by emission of gravitational waves is negligible . ) therefore , the two necessary conditions , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , can be regarded as almost inherent to magnetars with strong @xmath9 .",
    "actually , the strong pulsations observed from nearly all magnetars imply @xmath186 .",
    "the remaining requirement for the detection of free precession , i.e. , the non - axi - symmetric emission pattern of the hard component , is considered more conditional , rather than intrinsic .",
    "one possibility is that a magnetic dipole on @xmath17 is magnetically connected to a nearby local multipole , and this connecting region is responsible for the hard x - ray generation .",
    "depending on the detailed magnetic configuration , such a radiation may well have the required anisotropy around , and positional offsets from , @xmath17 .",
    "since the magnetic configuration of a magnetar may change with time @xcite , e.g. , across active states , @xmath66 can change even though @xmath29 and @xmath23 will be kept constant .",
    "actually , the hard x - ray phase modulation of 4u 0142 + 61 , detected in 2009 , was reconfirmed in a subsequent observation in 2013 @xcite , but was absent in the 1st suzaku observation made in 2007 ( @xcite ; see also mea14 ) .",
    "it is hence of significant interest to clarifiy whether the precession properties ( particularly @xmath66 ) of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 5048 have been changing along with its long - term decay after the 2009 activity .      from equation ( [ eq : slip ] ) ,",
    "1e 1547.0@xmath05408 is concluded to be aspheric by @xmath187 , which is of the same order as that of 4u 0142 + 61 , @xmath188 ( mea14 ) .",
    "then , adopting the magnetic deformation interpretation , these ns are both inferred via equation  ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) to have @xmath189 g. the present result thus gives a strong support to the suggestion by mea14 , that magnetars have ultra - intense @xmath9 and are hence deformed to a detectable level .",
    "while 4u  0142 + 61 is a rather aged magnetar with a characteristic age of @xmath190 kyr and @xmath191 g , 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 has @xmath192 kyr and @xmath193 g. even though @xmath194 of magnetars can be systematically overestimated @xcite , 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 is clearly a much younger and more active object than the other , as evidenced by its high activity .",
    "the somewhat smaller @xmath22 of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 apparently contradicts to these facts , and the prospect that magnetars must be consuming their toroidal ( or internal ) , as well as dipole ( or external ) , field energies .",
    "possibly , the @xmath9 vs @xmath7 ratio may scatter considerably among mangetars . to answer this issue , we clearly need to increase the number of detections of the free precession from magnetars .",
    "the significance of the 36 ks hxd phase modulation described in section  [ subsec : significance ] was evaluated through a _",
    "study using the actual data themselves , rather than via a monte - carlo method .",
    "let us explain how this was carried out .    for this purpose",
    ", we again refer to the two - dimensional array @xmath116 ( section  [ subsec : waveform ] ) , into which all the detected x - ray events have been sorted .",
    "the @xmath44 calculation is equivalent to producing a folded pulse profile simply as @xmath195 and applying the fourier transform to @xmath196 with respect to @xmath197 .",
    "we employ a rather large values of @xmath198 and @xmath199 , namely @xmath200 and @xmath201 , to avoid binning issues .",
    "the demodulation procedure , instead , executes the summation by systematically shifting the pulse phase as @xmath202 with @xmath203    let us assume , as a null hypothesis , that the pulse phase is intrinsically _ not _ modulated at the period @xmath29 .",
    "then , the demodulation procedure using equation ( [ eq : ap1_2 ] ) and equation ( [ eq : ap1_3 ] ) has two effects ; ( i ) to degrade the underlying pulse coherence , and ( ii ) to add up poisson noises of different pixels in various different ways .",
    "then , large values of @xmath89 , like in equation ( [ eq : z2_max ] ) , would appear when ( ii ) by chance overwhelms ( i ) .",
    "importantly , these two effects must remain unchanged even when a random permeation is applied on the rows @xmath204 , because all rows must be equivalent with one another when considering ( i ) , and the poisson noise in different pixels of @xmath116 should be independent when considering ( ii ) .    with the above in mind",
    ", we repeated the same demodulation search 1,000 times , over the same @xmath86 volume . in each trial , @xmath205 in the above two equations were replaced with @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is a random permutation of @xmath204 .",
    "different trials employed different realizations of the permutation , all with @xmath200 .",
    "we thus obtained 1,000 values of @xmath89 , of which the histogram is shown in figure  [ fig : chance_probability ] ( a ) . by integrating this distribution from @xmath208 towards lower values @xmath89 , the upper probability integral has been obtained as in figure  [ fig : chance_probability ] ( b ) .",
    "this gives the chance occurrence probability of large values of @xmath89 , under the absence of any intrinsic periodicity at @xmath29 .",
    "equation  [ eq : chance ] provides its approximation at @xmath209 .",
    "this control study is considered to be rather conservative for the following reasons .",
    "when the phase modulation is sinusoidal , a small difference in the initial value of @xmath67 will not affect @xmath84 , because @xmath210 is expected to have a long coherence length in @xmath67 .",
    "this makes a scan over @xmath67 only partially independent .",
    "however , when the random permutation is employed , @xmath210 attains a rather short ( typically , @xmath211 radian ) coherence in @xmath67 , so that scans over @xmath67 become essentially all independent . as a result",
    ", one control run is expected to involve effectively a lager number of trials .",
    "if this effect is taken into account , the true chance probability would be even lower than equation ( [ eq : chance ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ccf ] presents cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) between ( i ) the modulation- phase - resolved ( without demodulation ) six pulse profiles , against ( ii ) the demodulated profile in figure  [ fig : folded_profiles ] in red which includes all the 1540 kev hxd - pin events . in order to reconcile the limited statistics with the need for a fine timing resolution , we first accumulated ( i ) in 12 bins per cycle as @xmath212 , using the same nomenclature as section  [ subsec : waveform ] and appendix 1 , and then interpolated / smoothed each of them so that it become a 120-bin profile , @xmath213 , as @xmath214 with @xmath215 and @xmath216 . after processing ( ii ) in a similar way , we calculated ccfs , ( i ) @xmath217 ( ii ) , in an ordinary manner .",
    "this procedure is nearly identical to an alternative way , i.e.,first produce ( i ) and ( ii ) both in 120 bins , then cross correlate them , and heavily smooth the derived ccf .",
    "the present method has an advantage that we can inspect @xmath116 under relatively good statistics .",
