    "bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) was achieved in 1995 in a remarkable series of experiments on atomic vapors @xcite , and has tremendously boosted both theoretical and experimental studies ( for an up - to - date review , see , e. g. , dalfovo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . among others ,",
    "the study of collective excitations in bec gives us a great test on the finite - temperature many - body theory of interacting bose gases that has been developed over last several decades .",
    "it is well known that excitations associated with bec have been well studied in the context of liquid @xmath1he @xcite .",
    "the semi - phenomenological landau hydrodynamic theory is very successful , but it essentially leans on an _ ad hoc _ postulated hamiltonian and the roles of bose condensation and broken symmetry are not clear there @xcite .",
    "this theory was justified in a sense of microscopic arguments by feynman @xcite . on the other hand , beginning with the work of london @xcite , a microscopic theory of superfluid @xmath1he using field theoretical methods has also been extensively investigated through a weakly interacting gas model @xcite .",
    "the most important results obtained from this model are based on the presence of a bose condensate , which breaks down the global symmetry @xmath0 of the system .",
    "in fact , the concept of broken symmetry originated in particle physics has been brought into the low temperature phenomena of superfluidity and superconductivity first by anderson @xcite , and now it is believed that it controls much of dynamics of many - body systems .    in the microscopic study of a bose condensed gas , one usually needs a detailed model like that of bogoliubov , beliaev @xcite , or gross - pitaevskii to explain the mechanism for a bose condensate , and as a basis for approximate quantitative calculations , but not to derive the most important exact consequences of the spontaneous symmetry breakdown .",
    "( of course , such a microscopic model itself is an approximation . ) yet , if the general features are in fact model independent consequences of the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry , why ca nt we derive them directly from this breakdown by finding the most general effective lagrangian of the system ?",
    "an answer to this question is provided by a standard technique of modern quantum field theory @xcite , called the effective field theory approach to the symmetry breaking .",
    "it was applied to superconductivity @xcite where the fundamental properties of conventional superconductors such as meissner effect and flux quantization are derived directly from the spontaneous breakdown of electromagnetic gauge invariance without using a detailed model like that of bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory .",
    "this paper aims to show that many important properties of low - energy excitations in a generic homogeneous bose system can be essentially determined as the exact consequence of spontaneously broken symmetry without introducing unnecessary approximations .",
    "assuming the @xmath0 invariance is spontaneously broken , we shall derive the most general effective lagrangian of the system by performing procedures very much analogous to that of pion - nucleon effective field theory @xcite in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the present paper gives an alternative derivation of the popov effective lagrangian that we used for calculating the damping rate of the excitation @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the whole procedure is incredibly simple and straightforward , but also gives a feasible way of predicting some experimental observables .",
    "an example on the damping rate shall be given to show how the theory works easily .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , it offers a deep way of justifying the landau theory of quantum hydrodynamics and explaining why a weakly interacting gas model can yield some meaningful results for strongly interacting superfluid @xmath1he .",
    "second , it shows a simple , powerful effective field theory approach to investigating the excitation dynamics of a homogeneous bose condensed system .",
    "we start by considering a simple nonrelativistic many - body problem of spinless bosonic particles at finite temperature . in units of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "its euclidean action functional is given by  @xcite @xmath4 = \\int_0^\\beta d \\tau \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty d^3 x { \\cal",

    "obviously , the action ( [ eq : i ] ) is galilean - invariant , and is invariant under the global phase transformations of group @xmath0 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 an arbitrary constant .",
    "this symmetry is known to be completely broken below some critical temperature @xmath12 , i.e. , a bose ",
    "einstein condensate appears with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the particle density and current associated with the symmetry are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with the current conservation @xmath16    according to our general understanding of spontaneously broken symmetries @xcite , any system described by an action with symmetry group @xmath17 , when in a phase in which @xmath17 is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath18 , will possess a set of goldstone modes , described by fields that transform under @xmath17 like the coordinates of the coset space @xmath19 . in our case",
    ", there will be a single goldstone mode described by a ( massless ) real scalar field @xmath20 that transforms under @xmath21 like the phase @xmath11 itself . the group @xmath0 has the multiplication rule @xmath22 , so under a phase transformation with parameter @xmath11 the field @xmath20 will undergo the transformation @xmath23    in low temperature physics , the goldstone mode is accompanied with another excitation , known as the density ( order parameter ) fluctuation , which we will see to have nearly zero frequency in the long - wavelength limit . both together form a non - trivial irreducible linear representation of the group @xmath0 . to see",
    "the theory must involve the goldstone fields , we may write all ordinary complex fields as @xcite @xmath24 where the @xmath25 is the density field . under phase transformation ,",
    "the @xmath25 is invariant while @xmath26 transforms according to the rule ( [ eq : phi_transform ] ) .",
    "now , rewritten in terms of fields @xmath26 and @xmath25 , the lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) becomes @xmath27 if the @xmath0 symmetry is broken , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates the expectation value over the ground state .",
    "it follows that we may write @xmath30 , where the @xmath31 field describes density fluctuations , known also as collective modes .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath26 and @xmath31 then reads @xmath32 where we have ignored all total derivatives . for later use ,",
    "we record the current conservation in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath31 explicitly : @xmath33 \\over m}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : jconservation2}\\ ] ]    here is an important point : to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) it was not really necessary to start with the model lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "indeed , according to our understanding of spontaneously broken symmetry , we did not need to start with _ any _ specific theory .",
    "a familiar example in particle physics is the effective theory of pion - nucleon interaction with @xmath34 spontaneously broken to @xmath35 .",
    "the important thing is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) is invariant under the @xmath0 transformation .",
    "the general theory of broken symmetries ( see , for example , weinberg @xcite ) tells us that , for symmetry group @xmath0 , the most general form of the effective lagrangian for the density fluctuation field and the goldstone field must be constructed solely from the ingredients @xmath31 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 together with higher derivatives of these objects .",
    "there are also two additional rules that the lagrangian must obey .",
    "the first rule is the galilean invariance for a non - relativistic system such that the combination of @xmath40 must always appear together in the effective lagrangian and likewise @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "this has been understood through investigations by takahashi @xcite and greiter _",
    "the second rule is the time - reversal symmetry such that the action is invariant under the transformation @xmath42 this is observed from the action ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "this symmetry requires that only the even powers of the galilean invariant @xmath43 $ ] be included in the lagrangian .",

    "this is equivalent to have terms of @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] by making use of the current conservation ( [ eq : jconservation2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "hence , according to the above prescription the most general @xmath0-invariant action functional takes the following form @xmath45 = \\int_0^\\beta d \\tau \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty d^3 x { \\cal l}_{\\mbox{eff } } \\label{eq : ieff}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 -{f_\\phi\\over 2 m } ( \\nabla\\phi)^2       -{f^\\prime_\\phi m\\over 2}\\left[i\\partial_\\tau\\phi -{(\\nabla\\phi)^2   \\over 2m}\\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\   & & -{f^{\\prime\\prime}_\\phi m^2\\over 3!}\\left[i\\partial_\\tau\\phi      -{(\\nabla\\phi)^2   \\over 2m}\\right]^3     -{f_\\sigma \\over 2 m } ( \\nabla\\sigma)^2     -{c_2\\over 2m}\\sigma^2 - { c_3\\over 3!m } \\sigma^3   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   - { c_3^\\prime m\\over 2 } \\sigma       \\left[i\\partial_\\tau\\phi -{(\\nabla\\phi)^2\\over 2m}\\right]^2      - { c_3^{\\prime\\prime } \\over 2 } \\sigma^2       \\left[i\\partial_\\tau\\phi",

    "( here , we adopt a normalization such that @xmath26 is dimensionless and @xmath31 has the dimension of @xmath53 . )",
    "similar effective lagrangians appeared in different contexts , but were all based on some microscopic model .",

    "_ @xcite found it equivalent to a time - dependent non - linear schrdinger lagrangian for bcs superconductors at @xmath54 , and demircan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite implied that it could be obtained from the feynman wave function of superfluids . if @xmath55 and @xmath31 are identified with the phonon velocity field @xmath56 and the density variation @xmath57 of ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively , one finds the action ( [ eq : ieff ] ) corresponds to a hamiltonian @xmath58 which is one form of the landau - khalatnikov hydrodynamic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "hence , the landau quantum hydrodynamics is the exact consequence of the breakdown of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "many - body properties can be studied through propagators ( or green s functions ) . in the following",

    "notice that the energy spectrum is linear in @xmath81 , vanishing as @xmath82 .    in the calculation of feynman diagrams at finite temperatures in euclidean field theory ,",
    "one encounters the summation over discrete matsubara frequencies .",
    "a standard technique ( see , for example , @xcite ) is available to perform such a matsubara summation .",
    "the trick is to use a contour integral in the complex energy plane .",
    "let @xmath83 be a function of complex variable @xmath84 , analytical on the line re@xmath85 , which decreases faster than @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "we then have @xmath88 where @xmath89 and the @xmath90 is a contour in complex @xmath84-plane encircling all poles of function @xmath83 in a positive sense ( but those of function @xmath91 in a negative sense ) .",
    "now consider a general process involving arbitrary numbers of the goldstone field @xmath26 and the density fluctuation field @xmath31 .",
    "we suppose that their energies and momenta and the thermal energy ( @xmath92 ) are all at most of some order @xmath52 , which is small compared with @xmath93 defined above . even though lagrangians like ( [ eq : leff2 ] ) are not renormalizable in the usual sense , we saw in , for example",
    ", the pion - nucleon theory @xcite that such lagrangians can yield finite results as long as they contain all possible terms allowed by symmetries , for then there will be a counterterm available to cancel every infinity .",
    "if we define the renormalized values of the constants @xmath94 in @xmath95 by specifying the values at energies of order @xmath52 , then the integrals in momentum - space feynman diagrams will be dominated by contributions from virtual momenta which are also of order @xmath52 ( because renormalization makes them finite , and there is no other possible effective cut - off in the theory )",
    ". we can then develop perturbation theory as a power series expansion in @xmath52 .",
    "each derivative in each interaction vertex contributes one factor of @xmath52 to the order of magnitude of the diagram ; internal propagators @xmath96 , @xmath97 @xmath98 , and @xmath99 contribute factors of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and a unit , respectively ; and each integration volume @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) associated with the loops of the diagram contributes a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "so a general connected diagram make a contribution of order @xmath105 , where @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the number of derivatives in an interaction of type @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the number of interaction vertices of type @xmath108 in the diagram , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the numbers of internal @xmath26 lines and @xmath26-@xmath31 cross lines , respectively , and @xmath112 is the number of loops . there is a familiar topological relation for connected graphs : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the number of goldstone fields @xmath26 in interactions of type @xmath108 and @xmath115 is the number of external @xmath26 lines .",

    "however , our result has been derived without assuming a weak coupling , so it is valid for general bose condensed liquids including superfluid @xmath1he .    for temperature such that @xmath141 , we can follow the same arguments as we had for @xmath54 , but some additional examination on diagrams is demanded in order to get the correct @xmath81 and @xmath64 dependences of @xmath135 . each self - energy element",

    "einstein condensate ( or broken @xmath0 symmetry ) evident , and gives us a model - independent effective action that can immediately predict results for experiments .",
