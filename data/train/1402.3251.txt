    "models of planar random geometry appear in physics in the context of two - dimensional quantum gravity and provide an interplay between mathematical physics and probability theory .",
    "causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) and its predecessor dynamical triangulation ( dt ) , introduced by ambjrn and loll ( see @xcite ) , constitute attemps to provide a meaning to the formal expressions appearing in the path integral quantization of gravity ( see @xcite , @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the idea is to approximate the path integral by changing integration with respect to continuous random geometry by integration with respect to dts or cdts . as a result ,",
    "the path integral with respect to continuous random geometries is replaced by a weighted sum over discrete geometries , where the weights are defined by the discrete form of the original action . in this paper",

    "is interpreted as a _ coupling gravity with matter_. this type of coupling has been a subject of persistent interest in physics once the matrix model methods were successfully applied to the ising model on random lattice with coordination number @xmath3 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . in this article",
    "we discuss the ising model coupled to causal triangulations in details , study the termodinamic function known as free energy , and formally define the critical curve for the annealed model .",
    "this annealed model was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "this model was also studied by @xcite , where the authors develop a systematic counting of embedded graphs and evaluate thermodynamic functions at high and low temperature expansion ( see @xcite and @xcite for other progress made for the annealed model ) .",
    "the main advantage of the cdts over the dts is that the ensemble of cdts is more regular than the ensemble of the dts , in the sense that does not permite spacial topology changes and leads to a fractal dimension @xmath4 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the causality constraints still make it difficult to find an analytical solution of the ising model coupled to cdts , however some progress has been recently made about existence of gibbs measures and phase transitions ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) . employing transfer matrix techniques and in particular the krein - rutman theory of positivity - preserving operators",
    ", @xcite determines a region in the quadrant of parameters @xmath5 where the finite - volume free energy has a thermodynamic limit . in this article",
    "the authors provide first approximations of the infinite - volume free energy , and conditions for existence of gibbs measures .",
    "furthermore , the authors prove that in the determined region the annealed model presents a subcritical behaviour , i.e. , there exists a unique gibbs distribution for the model , and that with respect to this limit measure the average surface has a form of an infinite narrow tube , which is essentially one dimensional .",
    "computation of the critical curve ( point ) for models in statistical mechanics has always been a challenging problem , and since fk models were introduced by fortuin and kasteleyn in 1969 ( see @xcite ) , they have become an important tool in the study of phase transition for spin models .",
    "the goal of this article is to use the fk representation of the ising model coupled to cdt in order to obtain lower and upper bounds for the critical curve .",
    "we employ the results of @xcite to establish a region where the n - strip gibbs measure has no weak limit as @xmath6 , where the boundary of this region provides a lower bound for the critical curve .",
    "futhermore , we expand the region of subcritical behaviour of the model , and provide a better approximation to the free energy .",
    "the aforementioned fk representation utilizes a family of poisson point processes and the lie - trotter product formula to interpret exponential sums of operators as random operator products .",
    "this representation was originally derived in @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite for an overview ) .",

    "note that by the definition of a spanning subgraph , it is easy to see that for any @xmath277 the following inequalities hold @xmath278 if @xmath279 the unique spanning subgraph @xmath264 that do not satisfy the right - hand side of inequality ( [ inequalityclus ] ) is @xmath280 . in this case , the graph @xmath264 has @xmath281 vertices and @xmath282 edges . if @xmath283 the inequality ( [ inequalityclus ] ) is satisfied . in order to obtain lower bounds for the representation ( [ newformpf ] ) , we implement inequality ( [ inequalityclus ] ) for two different cases : @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",

    "thus , the lower bound can be obtain as @xmath305 .",
    "for example , for @xmath306 and @xmath307 , all elements of any decomposition are spanning trees .",

    "the lower bound given by ( [ notimprov ] ) does not improve the lower bound given by the first griffiths inequality .      for each @xmath328 , we define the following sets in @xmath329 @xmath330 @xmath331 note that @xmath332 for all @xmath333 , @xmath334 , and that the finite - volume gibbs measure @xmath335 on the set @xmath336 exists .",
    "we also define the @xmath9-strip functions @xmath337 associated with the set @xmath338 , for each @xmath333 , as follows @xmath339 by the properties of the trace class operators ( see @xcite for an overview ) , we deduce that @xmath340 is a monotone decreasing sequence of measurable functions such that @xmath341 , for all @xmath125 , where @xmath342 is defined in ( [ f_1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we prove the existence of the pointwise limit @xmath343 another important fact is that the graph of the function @xmath344 provides an upper bound for the critical curve .",
    "this property is a consequence of the spectral properties of the operator @xmath83 introduced in ( [ trmatrix])(see @xcite for the details and @xcite for an overview ) and the definition of the function @xmath344 .",

    "the lower bound is a consequence of theorem [ theomain1 ] .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "in this article we present a step towards improving the subcriticality domain for an ising model coupled to two - dimensional cdt introduced in @xcite . in doing",
    "so we employ fk representation of the ising model on causal triangulations and combinatorial approximation .",
    "in addition , we make a first step towards determining the critical curve of the model .",
    "numerical evidence shows that the model has phase transition ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but this fact has never been proved explicitly . in this article",
    "we presente mathematical evidence of existence of the critical curve by studying the infinite - volume free energy , and computing a region where the critical curve for the annealed model is possibly located ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . the discussion in section [ sect2.3 ] along with corollary [ mainresult3 ]",
    "suggest that free energy can be expresed as @xmath356 , where the function @xmath357 satisfies @xmath358 .",
    "this result leads to a plausible conjecture that the boundary of the subcritical domain coincides with the locus of points @xmath173 where @xmath359 , however in order to obtain more precise conclusions a further investigation is required .",
    "in addition , theorem [ theomain1 ] and theorem [ theomain2 ] show that with respect to the weak limit gibbs measure @xmath153 , the average diameter of any fixed height @xmath250 is bounded in the region @xmath360 ( by a constant independent of @xmath250 ) with probability 1 , which is essentially a one dimensional random geometry .",
    "thus , we can expect that this subcritical behaviour can be extended to the region @xmath361 , and that any causal triangulation on the critical curve has hausdorff dimension @xmath4 , @xmath362-a.s . finally , if the annealed model has this property , then the region where it presents a phase transition is possibly located on the critical curve .",
