    "[ section - intro ] the concept of a hyperbolic group can be generalized to the realm of compactly generated , topological groups by a straightforward adaption of the definition in the discrete case ( see definition  [ def : hyp - topg ] on page  ) .",
    "such a generalization is an instance of _ ` geometric group theory for topological groups ' _ , which is a line of investigation proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this geometric approach is a natural one in the case of totally disconnected , locally compact groups , the subject of this paper , and has been pursued previously in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we take a different line to these papers , however , by studying hyperbolicity and relating it to a structural invariant for totally disconnected , locally compact groups , namely , the _ flat - rank_.    the flat - rank of a totally disconnected , locally compact group ( see definition  [ defn : flat - rank ] ) is a non - negative integer that is analogous to the @xmath2-rank of a semisimple algebraic group over a local field  @xmath2 . indeed",
    "the flat - rank and @xmath2-rank coincide when @xmath0 is such a group , by corollary  19 in  @xcite .    just as the @xmath2-rank of a simple algebraic group determines many properties of the group",
    ", the flat - rank can be expected to convey important information about general simple totally disconnected groups .",
    "an indication of this is seen with the computation of the flat - rank of automorphism groups of buildings made in  @xcite , where it is shown , in conjunction with results from  , that if the group action is sufficiently transitive then the flat - rank of the group equals the rank of its building . the following theorem , our main result , further demonstrates the relationship between the flat - rank and geometric properties of the group .",
    "[ mainthm - variant ] the flat - rank of a totally disconnected , locally compact , hyperbolic group is at most  @xmath1 .",
    "the major part of this paper is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ mainthm - variant ] .",
    "it is clear that the converse to this theorem does not hold , because discrete groups have flat - rank  0 and need not be hyperbolic .",
    "however , it may hold in the presence of further hypotheses that exclude discrete groups or non - discrete counterexamples based on them .",
    "the properties of algebraic groups of @xmath2-rank @xmath1 differ notably from the properties of groups of higher @xmath2-rank . in the expectation that the same will be true of the flat - rank ,",
    "a secondary aim of this paper is to seek further geometric criteria for a totally disconnected , locally compact group to have flat - rank at most  @xmath1 .",
    "we establish two such criteria .",
    "one is based on the action of the group on the space of compact open subgroups of the group .",
    "the criterion and its proof are in the spirit of the papers  @xcite and  @xcite ; the proof is contained in section  [ sec : hyperbolic orbits ] .",

    "[ def : hyp - topg ] a topological group is called _ hyperbolic _ if and only if it is compactly generated and its cayley graph with respect to some ( hence any ) compact generating set is gromov - hyperbolic .",
