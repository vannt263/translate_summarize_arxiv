    "2008 and references therein ) , galaxy clusters ( allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 ) , peculiar velocities ( mohayaee & tully 2005 ) and galaxy redshift distortions ( guzzo et al . 2008 ) have pinned down the cosmic abundance of the various matter energy components .",
    "these data indicate that pressureless matter ( baryons and cold dark matter ) accounts for only @xmath5 of the total energy content in the universe , leaving the remaining @xmath6 to be dark energy .    in light of these observations",
    "the existence of de phenomenon can hardly be contested nowadays , thus the question of its physical origin has become crucial especially from a fundamental physics perspective . the simplest scenario to account for a late time cosmic acceleration consists of a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 in einstein s equations of general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that today @xmath7 is of the order of the matter density @xmath8 suggests that we are living in a period of remarkable coincidence , since the value of @xmath0 must have been fixed very precisely at early times as to allow for a sufficient period of structure formation responsible for the distribution of matter that we observe today ( see e.g. weinberg 1989 ) .",
    "one can hope that understanding the physical nature of @xmath0 may solve this puzzling coincidence , but all known attempts have led to an even more troubling problem that can be explained only if an anthropic selection mechanism is at work .",
    "in fact the cosmological constant can be naturally interpreted as the energy contribution of quantum vacuum fluctuations , however standard model fields give rise to a vacuum energy density up to 119 order of magnitudes ( assuming a cut - off at the planck scale ) larger than the cosmological constant observed value , hence requiring an unnatural fine - tuning of the bare cosmological constant such as to ensure a precise cancelation of the energy associated to quantum vacuum diagrams .",
    "we still lack of a convincing theoretical explanation for this naturalness problem , and it may well be that the dark energy phenomenon is of complete different origin .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed in a vast literature , which include the existence of a light minimally coupled scalar field dubbed _ quintessence _",
    "( wetterich 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) motivated by physics beyond the standard model of particle physics , deviations from standard general relativity on cosmological scales due to higher order corrections to einstein gravity ( see e.g. capozziello , cardone & troisi 2005 ) , and modifications due to the presence of extra dimensions ( dvali , gabadadze and porrati 2000 ) . in quintessence cosmologies the late time dynamics of the scalar field is responsible for driving the cosmic accelerated expansion ( see copeland , sami & tsujikawa 2006 for a review ) .",
    "as the field rolls down its self - interaction potential the kinetic energy becomes small compared to the potential energy , causing the field pressure becoming sufficiently negative such as to drive the acceleration , namely @xmath9 ( for a flat universe ) at present time , where @xmath10 is the density parameter ( with @xmath11 being the planck mass and @xmath12 the hubble constant ) .",
    "a particular class of quintessence models is characterized by `` _ tracking _ '' potentials , for which the field dynamics has a late time accelerating attractor solution , preceeded by a period during which the scalar field energy density tracks that of the dominant background component ( see steinhardt , wang & zlatev 1999 ; zlatev , wang & steinhardt 1999 ) . in such models any dependency on the initial conditions is therefore erased , thus alleviating the coincidence problem . along these lines a full solution to such coincidence is provided by non - minimally coupled scalar field models , where the matter components are directly coupled to the scalar field ( see e.g. amendola 2000 ; khoury & weltman 2004 ; alimi & fzfa 2008 )    precision cosmology offers a unique opportunity to test the nature of dark energy .",
    "however , the parameter inference is usually limited by degeneracies amongst the various cosmological parameters , and the combination of several probes is indeed necessary .",
    "the imprint of quintessence on the cmb anisotropy power spectrum and the matter power spectrum has been studied in several works ( e.g. viana & liddle 1998 ; caldwell et al . 1998 ; perrotta & baccigalupi 1999 ; brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) .",
    "in particular it was shown that a dynamical dark energy component leaves a distinct signature on the cmb through the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect ( corasaniti et al .",
    "2003 ) , such that models fitting the cmb data , can allow for very different values of the normalization @xmath13 of the linear matter power spectrum ( kunz et al .",
    "the viability of these models has been tested against cmb and sn ia data in various works ( corasaniti & copeland 2002 ; baccigalupi et al .",
    "2002 ; colombo & gervasi , 2006 ) .",
    "these models can provide fit to the data at the same statistical level of the @xmath0cdm scenario , implying that cosmological data at redshift higher than @xmath14 are therefore necessary to further break parameter degeneracies and possibly distinguish between competing de models .    in recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest on whether the clustering of large - scale structures might be crucial for settling the debate on the physical nature of de .",
    "as this process covers a long - period between the dark ages and today ( @xmath15 ) , it appears as a unique experimentation field for building new tests of de .",
    "several studies have performed n - body simulations to evaluate the imprint of de on the non - linear regime of gravitational collapse and determined the signature on the mass power spectrum and cluster mass function ( see e.g. ma et al .",
    "1999 ; bode et al . 2001 ; lokas , bode & hoffman 2004 ; munshi , porciani & wang 2004 ) .",
    "these works have focus on de models specified by a constant equation of state , while benabed & bernardeau ( 2001 ) have performed an analytical study of the growth of matter pertubations for quintessence models at linear and second order respectively , and estimated the effect on the non - linear power spectrum .",
    "n - body simulations dedicated to quintessence cosmologies have been performed in various works ( klypin et .",
    "2003 ; dolag et al . 2004 ; solevi et al .",
    "2006 ) , other studies have also included the gas through n - body hydrodynamical simulations ( maio et al .",
    "2006 ; aghanim , da silva & nunes 2008 ) .",
    "these studies have concluded that the imprint of dark energy on the non - linear matter power spectrum and the cluster mass function at @xmath16 remains indistinguishable from the @xmath17 , while significant differences may arise at higher redshifts , with different halo profiles at all redshifts .",
    "a feature common to all these works is the fact that these analysis have exclusively focused on models specified by the same cosmological parameters values , independently of whether these values provide compatible fits of the underlying dark energy model to existing data .",
    "this is a crucial point , since it does not allow us to address an important question , namely whether detailed measurements of the non - linear clustering of matter are sensitive to the imprint quintessence / dark energy models which are currently not distinguishable from the standard @xmath18 using sn ia , cmb and linear matter power spectrum data .",
    "this is particularly relevant given the upcoming observational campaigns which will probe with high precision several aspects of the matter clustering .",
    "this question will be addressed in this paper , the first of a series dedicated to the imprint of `` realistic '' dark energy models on the non - linear structure formation . in the upcoming papers we will mostly focus on the physical properties of dm halos : mass functions , density profiles , virialisation process and internal velocity distribution .",
    "we will also investigate the spatial halo distribution and the influence on cosmological bias .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ quinte_eq ] we recall the basic equations describing the dynamics of quintessential cosmologies at the background and linear perturbation level ; in section  [ like_res ] we present the results of a combined likelihood analysis of the wmap5-years data and sn ia from the union dataset to constrain two different types of quintessence models specified by ratra - peebles and sugra potentials respectively .",
    "we then identify _ realistic _ quintessence models which are statistically indistinguishable from the vanilla @xmath18 and discuss their main phenomenological features in section  [ quinte_impr ] .",
    "we use these realistic models as benchmark for studying the structure formation through state - of - the - art n - body simulations which we present in section  [ quinte_sim ] .",
    "we will describe the numerical software developed for the realization of the project , the characteristics of the simulations and discuss the results .",
    "in particular we find that quintessence leaves several imprints in the non - linear matter power spectrum at all redshifts and on the non - linear growth of cosmic structures .",
    "finally we will present our conclusion and discuss future work in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "assuming the cosmological principle , the large scale universe can be considered homogeneous and isotropic and can thus be described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , which in terms of the conformal time @xmath19 reads as : @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the scale factor and @xmath22 is the length element . in this paper , we restrict to spatially flat geometries . throughout the paper",
    "we will use planck units ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "we assume the cosmic matter content to consist of pressureless matter ( composed of ordinary baryonic matter and cold dark matter ) , relativistic matter ( photons and neutrinos ) and a quintessence scalar field .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe , defined in terms of the scale factor by the _ hubble parameter _ @xmath25 ( a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath19 ) , is given by the friedmann equation : @xmath26+\\frac{8\\pi}{3m_{pl}^2}\\rho_q a^2,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 the hubble constant and @xmath27 is the present value of the density parameters , where @xmath28 is the critical density and @xmath29 indicates respectively the density contribution of pressureless matter and radiation ; @xmath30 stands for the energy density of quintessence .",
    "+   + the quintessence field is assumed to be a neutral ( real ) scalar field @xmath31 with self - interaction potential @xmath32 , which couples to ordinary matter only through its gravitational influence , ( i.e. minimally coupled scalar field ) .",
    "the field dynamics is given by the _ klein - gordon _ equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the field expressed in units of the planck mass .",
    "the quintessence energy density and pressure reads as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the quintessence equation of state .",
    "+   + the evolution of the system is completely determined by specifying the form of the quintessence potential and the scalar field initial conditions @xmath37 , which can be set in the early universe , for example at the end of inflation .",
    "convenient choices of @xmath32 are the so - called _ tracking potentials _ ( see steinhardt , wang & zlatev 1999 and references therein ) characterized by a late time scalar field dominated regime , which can be reached from a large range of initial conditions , spreading over dozens of order of magnitudes in the field phase space .",
    "we consider two well - known examples of such potentials .",
    "the _ ratra - peebles _ ( rp ) inverse power law ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are free parameters characterizing the slope and amplitude of the scalar self - interaction . here",
    "we fix the energy scale @xmath41 such that for a given value of @xmath42 the input value of @xmath43 is retrieved .",
    "this model was originally proposed to mimic a time - varying cosmological constant ( wetterich 1988 ) , which for nearly flat slopes is recovered at late times , when the scalar field remains frozen at large values by the cosmic expansion .",
    "a quintessence inverse power law potential has also been motivated in the framework of supersymmetric extensions of qcd ( binetruy 1999 ; masiero , pietroni and rosati 2000 ) . however , as noticed by brax & martin ( 2000 ) for present field values supergravity corrections should be included leading to the following form : @xmath44 which we will refer to as the _ sugra _ model .      at the inhomogeneous level , assuming small perturbations about the flrw metric , the linearly perturbed line element in the newtonian gauge is given by @xmath45\\cdot\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the bardeen potentials . differently from the cosmological constant a quintessential dark energy can cluster and its density perturbations can contribute to the evolution of the gravitational potentials in addition to the perturbations in the other matter components . in order to correctly compute the cmb and the linear matter power spectra ,",
    "we have modified the camb code ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 1999 ) to account both for the modification of the background expansion and the clustering of quintessence .",
    "two equivalent approaches have been adopted to cross - check the validity of the computation .",
    "the first is to evolve the perturbations @xmath48 of the quintessence field itself through the perturbed klein - gordon equation . in the fourier space",
    "we have : @xmath49 the perturbed einstein equations give the evolution of gravitational potentials @xmath47 and @xmath46 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the relative density contrast @xmath54 , velocity and equation of state for a given fluid @xmath55 ( see eq .",

    "an implicit summation over all the species @xmath55 ( photons , baryons , cold dark matter , neutrinos and quintessence ) has been assumed .",
    "written in terms of the scalar field perturbation the quintessence density contrast and velocity reads as : @xmath56 the second approach consists in considering quintessence as an additional fluid , in such a case the quintessence perturbations are characterized by an adiabatic sound speed @xmath57 and an intrinsinc entropy perturbation @xmath58 . in the framework of quintessence models",
    "these quantities take the following form @xmath59\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the continuity and the euler equation simplify to @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ v_q ' & =   -\\dfrac{\\delta_q}{1+w_q}+2\\mathcal{h}v_q -\\phi\\cdot \\label{pertq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for super - hubble scales , @xmath61 , the tracking properties of the self - interaction potential force the quintessence perturbations to follow a tracking solution as well ( see brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) . a departure from this regime",
    "occurs when the mass term @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ pert_kg ] ) becomes non - negligible .",
    "therefore , we assume that for all observable modes , the quintessence perturbations reach the tracking solution before becoming non - negligible ; this simplifies the choice of initial conditions .",
    "in fact it allows us to assume quintessence to be initially homogeneous .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the combined likelihood analysis of the latest sn ia and cmb data .",
    "our goal is to identify quintessence models characterized by a set of parameters ( @xmath63 ) , which are statistically consistent with the observations ( within @xmath64 ) , while departing from the standard @xmath18 values .",
    "these sets of parameters define what we call realistic quintessence models .",
    "sne ia standard candles provide a measurement of the luminosity distance @xmath65 , @xmath66 with @xmath67 is the dimensionless hubble parameter and @xmath68 is the cosmological redshift .",
    "hence , the hubble diagram leaves @xmath12 unconstrained and degenerate in the plane @xmath69 ( caresia , matarrese & moscardini 2004 ; schimd et al .",
    "therefore , we infer constraints from sn data after marginalizing analytically the @xmath70 over @xmath12 ( lewis & bridle 2002 ; di pietro & claeskens 2004 )",
    ". the cmb angular power spectrum is also degenerate in @xmath69 and @xmath71 planes , however these degeneracies are nearly orthogonal to those in the luminosity distance , thus providing improved parameter bounds . in addition under the flat geometry prior , cmb data allow for a precise measurement of @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 km@xmath75 @xmath3 ) , as well as the primordial power spectrum properties ( amplitude and slope ) .",
    "we perform a combined analysis of the wmap5-yrs cmb power spectra ( komatsu et al .",

    "we run a series of markov chains monte carlo using the publicly available codes camb and cosmomc ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 1999 ; lewis & bridle 2002 ) , properly modified to correctly account for the physics described in the previous section ( influence of quintessence and its perturbations ) .",
    "we assume uniform priors on the following parameters : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath42 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and marginalize over @xmath82 ( see komatsu et al .",

    "as we will discuss more in detail in the next section , this is because models with @xmath88 are characterized by a less accelerated cosmic expansion , therefore under the flatness requirement , they require a larger amount of dark energy ( lower matter density ) to account for the data . in table [ tab1 ] we show the marginalized confidence intervals on the model parameters for rp and sugra respectively .",

    "in addition these works have assumed the same value of the total matter density as inferred in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , hence it is not surprising that the authors have concluded that in quintessence models the present structure formation process , especially on the non - linear scales , slightly depart from the @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "an expection to the approach of these works is the recent analysis by casarini et al .",

    "in contrast we aim to study realistic models of quintessence which differ from the @xmath0cdm , while being statistically consistent with current cosmological data at level of significance that does not allow them to be distinguished from the @xmath0cdm .",
    "we choose a @xmath0cdm , rp and sugra model specified by the parameter values given in table [ tab2 ] .",

    "although the marginalized values of @xmath78 for rp and sugra models are slightly lower ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , the value assumed is within the @xmath106 confidence interval .",

    "we have isolated three main contributions to the rough differences between the power spectra of different dynamical dark energy models . on linear scales ( @xmath109 h mpc@xmath110 )",
    "the discrepancies can be explained by the differences in the linear power spectra ( which are due to the various cosmological parameters needed to reproduce the cmb and snia , the spatial fluctuations of the quintessence as well as the different background evolutions ) . on quasi - linear scales",
    "( @xmath111 h mpc@xmath112 h mpc@xmath110 ) , the discrepancies can be mainly explained by the non - linear amplification of the growth rate . since the linear amplitude is different , a given mode enters the non - linear regime at a different time . on the halo scales ( @xmath113 h mpc@xmath110 )",
    ", the differences are roughly due to the saturation of the growth of structures as they start to be virialised . again",
    ", this halo term depends mainly on the amplitude of the linear growth rate .",
    "+   + all the effects described above are rather well accounted for by the smith et al . ( 2003 ) fitting function of the matter power spectrum . in order to check whether there are additional non - linear contributions to the final shape of the power spectrum , we compute the ratio @xmath114 plotted in figure  [ history ] ( top panel ) for @xmath16 .",
    "we can see that on scales @xmath115 ( halo scale ) there is an enhancement of the power in quintessence models compared to the smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) prediction .",
    "this can be as large as @xmath116 at @xmath117 and reach even larger values at higher wavenumbers .",
    "this deviation is not a numerical artifact because as we already mentionned above , these wavenumbers are below the nyquist frequency .",
    "moreover the ratio of power spectra between two models is less sensitive to numerical errors that the absolute power spectrum itself , as previously mentioned .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with a number of works ( mcdonald et al .",
    "2006 ; ma 2007 ; francis et al .",
    "2007 and casarini et al .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ history ] we plot the deviations for sucdm ( dash - dotted line ) and rpcdm models and for comparison those tabulated by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( thin continuous lines ) in the case of dark energy models parametrized by constant equation of state @xmath118 ( see table [ tab2 ] for the values of @xmath119 ) .",
    "we find that deviations are nearly of the same order , @xmath120 level , towards higher values of the power spectrum at large k. nonetheless the are some important differences .",
    "first of all , the deviations appear to be stronger in dynamical quintessence models than in the @xmath121 case . secondly , the shape is slightly different near @xmath122 . finally , the disagreement is stronger for the sucdm cosmology .",
    "the reason is rather obvious if we look at fig .",
    "[ wq ] ( top panel ) .",
    "in fact the time variation of the equation of state is larger in sucdm .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated way of fitting these deviations has been proposed for a linear parametrization of the equation of state ( francis et al .",
    "2007 ) and extended to quintessence models ( casarini et al .",
    "the idea is to use the prediction of mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for an effective constant eos @xmath123 , that predicts the same distance to the last scattering surface of a dynamical quintessence model .",
    "although interesting , the generality of this approach is not clear .",
    "in addition , the mapping between the quintessence model and the effective description with constant eos at different epochs is not straighforward to implement , and can easily lead to misinterpretations . in comparison ,",
    "the complete approach described here is physically well motivated and allows for a robust accounting of the various effects . as we have shown here",
    ", each dark energy model has a specific cosmological evolution which leads to specific imprints , and it is not clear how well these features can be precisely accounted for in the approach proposed by casarini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "this point is also related to another important aspect , namely the universality of fitting procedures of the non - linear power spectrum based on large numerical simulations . as already pointed out by ma ( 2007 ) ,",
    "the history of structure formation is not properly taken into account by standard predictions such as that provided by smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) or peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is because the non - linear power spectrum is expressed as a fitting function of the cosmological parameters and the linear power spectrum .",
    "to some extent these fitting functions can be considered as instantaneous predictions from the linear power spectrum , since they do not depend in any way on the past evolutionary history of the structure formation of the model specified by the set of cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the non - linear regime should in principle have a fossil record of such history and thus the past influence of dark energy . as an example",
    "ma ( 2007 ) has shown that the deviations from one model to another scale as their relative linear growth histories .",
    "indeed , the imprint of the past evolution on the non - linear power spectrum is also present in the case of the realistic models considered here .",
    "in order to emphasize this result we have run two additional @xmath0cdm simulations for comparison : lcdmw1 ( wmapi cosmological parameters : @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath105 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) and lcdmw3 ( wmapiii cosmological parameters : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) . the deviations with the respect to the smith et al .",

    "we may note that the curves are in remarkably good agreement , although some small deviations ( below @xmath116 ) are present .",
    "the different level of deviations between the realistic quintessence models and these @xmath18 test runs can be explained in terms of their past history as described by the linear growth factor evolution . in figure  [ history ] ( bottom panel ) we plot the linear growth factor as function of the scale factor relative to the @xmath18 wmap5 case .",
    "we can see that deviations with respect to smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) at high k are well correlated to the maximum deviations between the linear growth histories of the different models . thus indicating that the past history of cosmic structure formation plays an important role since the features introduced in the matter power spectrum are not erased by the non - linear collapse : the non - linear collapse contributes to the specific imprints of the de model .",
    "a semi - analytical implementation of the structure formation history on the calculation of the non - linear power spectrum can be obtained using the halo model ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) , which accounts for the instant of collapse , the overdensity at virialization and the concentration parameters which depends on the assembly history ( wechsler et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this is further motivation for us to study in great details the impact of dark energy on the mass function and on the internal structure of dark matter halos , which will be discussed in other articles of the series .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the imprint of quintessence on the non - linear clustering of dark matter halos through state - of - the - art n - body simulations . to this purpose",
    "we have focused on two scalar field models specified by ratra - peebles and sugra potentials . upon these models",
    "we have performed a series of high resolution n - body simulations and shown that quintessence leaves a distinctive signature on the structure formation at all scales and especially during the non - linear regime .",
    "this is in contrast with conclusions drawn from previous works in the literature .",
    "some of these studies limited their analysis to dark energy models parametrized by a simply constant or linearly varying equation of state , which fail to grasp the specific feature of dark energy clustering throughout the cosmological evolution .",
    "other analysis have focused on the same class of quintessence models ; nevertheless , in all these studies the cosmological parameters were set to values corresponding to the concordance @xmath0cdm model , thus missing crucial features which are necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dark energy on the structure formation .",
    "the benchmark of dark energy models considered has been selected through a likelihood data analysis which we performed to determine quintessence model parameters that fit cmb and sn ia data within @xmath64 significance from the @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "these models are statistically indistinguishable from the concordance model ; nevertheless they are characterized by different cosmic expansion histories , which in addition to the effect of dark energy perturbations modify the growth of the linear dark matter perturbations , thus leaving quintessence model dependent signatures on the linear matter power spectrum",
    ". these imprints are consistent with current measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from sdss data , and statistically indistinguishable with the respect to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the results of the n - body simulations clearly show that the model dependent features present at the homogeneous and linear perturbation level are amplified by the non - linear collapse of dark matter structures .",
    "we find that quintessence affects the non - linear matter power spectrum at all scales , with a suppression of power at the small scales compared to the @xmath0cdm case .",
    "however when the effects of the different linear evolution histories are taken into account , the non - linear clustering of dm appears to be more efficient in quintessence cosmologies than in the standard @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "these features can only be partly understood in the smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) phenomenology framework , that as we have shown here it needs to be complemented with the full cosmic structure formation history to account for the imprint of de on the non - linear matter power spectrum .",
    "this support the idea that a robust evaluation of the impact of de on the non - linear structure formation requires an accurate and self - consistent implementation of the quintessence model in the n - body simulations .",
    "the imprints of quintessence on the dm distribution that we obtained here would affect the gas on all scales .",
    "as the gas collapses inside dm potential wells , the gas distribution would also keep a record of the nature of de . on large scales",
    ", the gas distribution tracks the dm one while on small scales the gas cooling accelerates the gas collapse but not the dm one . as a result , the star formation rate ( sfr ) could be affected by de . from the results of this paper , the sfr is expected to be smaller in quintessential universes than in the @xmath17 model due to the smaller @xmath13 in the first",
    ". however , the sfr in the past could be more important compared to the sfr today when de is quintessence rather than @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the ratio @xmath135 in quintessence models is higher than in @xmath17 .",
    "as well , the sfr at @xmath16 in quintessence models should be different than the one of a @xmath17 model with the same value of @xmath13 .",
    "the history of sfr is therefore expected to keep a specific record of the cosmic expansion history and therefore of the nature of de .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown by rasera & teyssier ( 2006 ) that the total sfr in the universe is ruled at first order by the amount of dm halos with total mass higher than a critical jeans - like mass called the filtering mass .",
    "this prescription could allow one to deduce sfr from dm halo mass function ( see the sequel of this paper ) .",
    "in addition , another expected imprint of de on the gas would arise from the gas collapse itself whose details , like accretion , cooling , sfr , supernovae feedback , ... , depend on the cosmic expansion history .",
    "finally , the feedback of the gas on dm will slightly affect dm distribution on small scales ( see also guillet et al . , 2009 ) .    in this work",
    ", we focused on the de signature on the non - linear matter power spectrum , in a series of upcoming papers we will present other characteristic imprints of dark energy scenarios on the non - linear structure formation , in particular we will provide a detailed study of the halo mass functions and the physical properties of dark matter halos .",
    "the results of our analysis already suggest that , contrary to common belief , an accurate comparison between the small and large scale distribution of matter in the universe can in principle shed light on the nature of dark energy .",
