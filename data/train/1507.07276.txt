    "when a displacement transformation is performed with quantum term @xmath15 , only terms with maximal overlap can generate new @xmath96 terms .",
    "explicitly , we can enumerate all possible cases :    1 .   a single density term @xmath86 where the site @xmath8 corresponds to a _ creation _ operator in @xmath26 transforms as @xmath97 the product of density terms @xmath98 where _ all _ the sites @xmath99 correspond to creation operators in @xmath26 , generate the exact same new terms as the single density term .",
    "to prove this , observe that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   the same results hold , with @xmath102 instead of @xmath51 , for a single density term @xmath86 where the site @xmath8 corresponds to a _ annihilation _ operator in @xmath26 transforms as @xmath103 this extends to products of density terms where the sites correspond to only annihilation operators in @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   the hermitian interaction @xmath44 transforms as @xmath104 4 .   under the displacement transformation with @xmath15 , new terms of the form",
    "@xmath44 can _ only _ be generated by the terms of the shape described in the previous three points .",
    "this follows from the fact that in order to generate terms like @xmath44 , you need to transform a term @xmath16 that has order less than or equal to @xmath15 , @xmath105 , and which has maximal overlap with @xmath15 .",
    "this means that _ all _ creation operators or all annihilation operators in @xmath16 should correspond to creation ( annihilation ) operators present in @xmath15 or @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , there can not be operators in @xmath16 on sites that are not present in @xmath15 , because those would be unaffected by the transition and all new terms would contain operators on these sites .",
    "since @xmath16 also contains annihilation operators , they must either live on the same site as the creation operators ( density terms ) , or they live on sites present in @xmath15 .",
    "we have thus reduced the possible set of @xmath16 s to the three cases presented above .",
    "in certain cases transforming a term @xmath15 away can generate terms with an even larger coupling constant .",
    "we will now show that this does not cause a problem .",
    "explicitly , imagine a hamiltonian of the form @xmath106 such that @xmath107 is the largest coupling constant , @xmath108 .",
    "the terms @xmath16 and @xmath109 have a maximal overlap with @xmath15 , and maximal overlap with each other . upon transforming the term @xmath15 away ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath110 and it is clear that one ( not both ! ) of the new coupling constants can be larger than the original @xmath107 .",
    "if both coupling constants are smaller , we are contently moving closer to desired convergence .",
    "instead , consider the unfortunate case , where @xmath111 . by virtue of our system of consecutive transformations",
    ", the next step should be to transform away the term @xmath16 .",
    "doing so regenerates the original term @xmath15 , however , this time with a smaller coupling constant , @xmath112 because @xmath113 by construction .",
    "this implies that the little detour caused by the larger coupling constant has come to an end , and the coupling constant in front of @xmath15 has been reduced .",
    "now one can track the magnitude of the coupling strength of each quantum term @xmath15 .",
    "every now and then in the sequence of consecutive displacement transformation the term @xmath15 has the strongest coupling , and will be transformed away . by the arguments presented above , every next time we transform with @xmath15 it will have a smaller coupling constant .",
    "as we have shown , the value of each coupling constant reduces through the consecutive application of displacement transformation . we will now estimate the speed at which the method converges , inspired by the works of d. fisher@xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us focus on @xmath114 order terms first , for a system with @xmath63 sites .",
    "the hamiltonian is , at each step of the renormalization procedure , given by @xmath115 where the coupling constants @xmath116 are changing with every transformation .",
    "the total number of independent quantum terms are @xmath117 additionally , there are @xmath118 classical terms at order @xmath114 , and @xmath63 classical terms at order @xmath119 that wo nt change under renormalization .    in the spirit of strong disorder renormalization group theory ( sdrg ) , we define a probability distribution @xmath120 for the absolute value of the quantum interaction coupling constants @xmath121 . since we are explicitly looking at finite size systems , we must be careful about the interpretation of a probability distribution .",
    "a finite size system can be viewed as a specific realization with @xmath122 terms taken from the distribution @xmath120 .",
    "given a continuous @xmath120 , the expectation value for largest coupling constant becomes @xmath123 for example , if @xmath120 is a uniform distribution between @xmath124 $ ] , the expectation value for @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , the expectation value for the second - to - largest coupling constant is @xmath126 the uniform distribution yields @xmath127 , which is the expected result .",
    "each displacement transformation changes the distribution @xmath120 . for a finite size system",
    ", we must pick the largest realized coupling constant @xmath128 , and apply the transformation .",
    "this coupling constant becomes zero .",
    "the new distribution , by virtue of the fact that @xmath129 was the largest realized coupling constant , should have zero weight for @xmath130 .",
    "we obtain the distribution of the remaining couplings , @xmath131 the next step is to see how the given displacement transformation acts on the remaining terms",
    ". only terms with maximal overlap will be able to generate new terms at the same order . given any interaction there are @xmath132 terms that have maximal overlap .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secdimlcc ] , the overlapping terms always come in pairs , say @xmath16 and @xmath109 .",
    "the old interaction strengths @xmath133 and @xmath134 are transformed into @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "consequently , a fraction @xmath137 is changed by the transformation , and the new distribution function of couplings becomes @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the parameter associated with the displacement transformation .",

    "the method of consecutive displacement transformations converges if the expectation value of the largest coupling constant under the new distribution @xmath141 reduces significantly .",
    "we will now show that if initially only a sparse set of interactions have large coupling constants , the largest coupling constant reduces exponentially . if , on the other hand , the system has initially a large set of large coupling constants , the distribution @xmath120 will naturally become more and more sparse close to its upper bound .",
    "once a sparse distribution is reached , the first argument again applies and a exponential decay sets in .",
    "consider a system where , initially , only @xmath142 of the quantum terms have a nonzero coupling constant .",
    "a typical initial distribution would be @xmath143 in the large @xmath63 limit , the expectation value for the largest coupling constant is @xmath144 let us now apply eqns .",

    "the terms have a simple physical explanation .",
    "the first term with @xmath153 is obtained because new terms are generated that had originally @xmath154 , but due to the transformation have become nonzero .",
    "the next term consists of terms that were originally present , but due to the transformation are reduced by a factor @xmath155 . in both cases",
    ", it affects only a relative @xmath156 number of terms .",
    "the final term on the last line consists of the pairs as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secdimlcc ] , where both @xmath133 and @xmath134 were nonzero prior to the transformation .",
    "this last part is dangerous , since it generates a weight of the distribution for @xmath15 larger than @xmath157 .",
    "however , even in the worst case scenario of a many - body resonance , which yields @xmath158 , the integrated probability to find a new coupling constant larger than @xmath157 is @xmath159 we are saved by the sparseness of the initial set ! in the new distribution @xmath160 the expectation value for the largest coupling constant is , in the large @xmath63 limit , @xmath161 since the top of the distribution remains @xmath156 with our method , this estimate can be generalized to every step .",
    "consequently , the coupling constant after @xmath8 steps is given by @xmath162 we have shown that for initially sparse interactions , the largest coupling constant will be reduced exponentially .",
    "this is consistent with , for example , the inset of fig .",
    "[ localization36 ] of this supplementary information .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ gammasmaller ] ) implies that the number of transformations required scales in a polynomial fashion with system size .",
    "the overall computational complexity of diagonalizing a hamiltonian using displacement transformations , at a given order , is therefore also polynomial .",
    "the above arguments do not apply when our initial distribution has a dense set of large interactions .",
    "a typical example is the uniform distribution , @xmath163 the expectation value for the largest coupling constant is now , @xmath164 from the uniform distribution it is clear that there will be a macroscopic number of quantum terms that will , through the transformation , get a coupling constant _ larger _ than @xmath157 . as eqn .",
    "( [ convo1 ] ) shows , the new distribution function has a cut - off at @xmath165 and it goes to zero in a linear fashion , @xmath166 .",

    "in general , if @xmath120 goes to zero as @xmath169 , the next distribution has a tail of the form @xmath170 .",
    "the central limit theorem tells us that quickly the distribution will approach a normal distribution .",
    "a normal distribution is a prime example of a distribution with a sparse tail .",
    "once the distribution @xmath120 has reached its gaussian shape , we can revert to the arguments of the previous subsection to claim an exponential decay of the largest coupling constant .",
    "notice that this argument is very similar to fishers a posteriori justification for sdrg by introducing the infinite disorder fixed point@xcite .",
    "here the displacement transformation method seems to fail when there are many large interactions , however , the consecutive transformations make the tail of the coupling constant distribution so small that we reach a regime of exponentially sparse large coupling constants .",
    "we have just shown that for order @xmath114 the largest coupling constant falls off exponentially with prefactor @xmath171 . for higher order interactions",
    "we observe that the relative density of terms with maximal overlap , @xmath137 , scales as @xmath172 .",
    "consequently , to diagonalize a hamiltonian up to order @xmath56 given a fixed numerical precision , one needs to perform @xmath173 displacement transformations . because there are @xmath174 quantum terms up to order @xmath56 , the total computational complexity scales as @xmath175    we computed the actual cpu time needed to diagonalize the model introduced in the main text , up to order @xmath114 , as a function of different system sizes .",

    "<S> here we show results deep in the many - body localized phase with @xmath74 , for a system size @xmath72 averaged over 20 disorder realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the different curves represent the two - body @xmath75 , three - body @xmath76 and four - body @xmath77 coefficients , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the coupling constants is almost independent of the order of the interaction . </S>",

    "<S> the different curves represent the cut - off at a given order @xmath81 . in the localized phase </S>",
    "<S> even few - body interactions are sufficient to reproduce the ed results . in the delocalized regime </S>",
    "<S> one needs to go up to order 8 , whereas around the mbl transition interactions of even higher order need to be included . ]    </S>",
    "<S> deep in the disordered phase , for @xmath74 , the coefficients in the hamiltonian fall off exponentially with the maximum distance of the sites involved . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantified by computing the average of the absolute value of the coefficients , @xmath82 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ coefficient1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the strength of the coupling constants appears to be independent of the number of density terms involved .    </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of our method is that we can also compute the classical hamiltonian in the delocalized phase . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ coefficient2 ] we show the distance - dependence of the hamiltonian coefficients as a function of disorder , ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> if the disorder is weaker than @xmath85 the coefficients become independent of distance , which signals delocalization .    to test the accuracy of our method </S>",
    "<S> , we compared the ground state energy obtained using our method with exact diagonalization ( ed ) results for @xmath80 , see the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ coefficient2 ] . with only terms </S>",
    "<S> up to 4th order we get a more than 95% accuracy in the localized phase . however , close to the transition and in the delocalized regime higher order terms are necessary to approach the ed results . </S>",
    "<S> for the delocalized regime the 8th order terms seem to be sufficient , yet at the critical point we need even more - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests our method becomes very expensive close to the localization - delocalization transition .    </S>",
    "<S> having thus established that the practical implementation of our scheme correctly reproduces ed results in the localized regime , we can directly probe the locality of the integrals of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals of motion are given by transforming the initial density - operators @xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the product of all the displacement transformations . </S>",
    "<S> note that at quadratic order , @xmath89 , consistent with the fact that the single - particle spectrum is unchanged by the interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the average of the absolute value of the coefficients @xmath19 as a function of the distance away from the original site @xmath8 is shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ coefficient1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals of motion are indeed exponentially localized , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the localization length for @xmath90 is , however , different from the length associated with the decay of the interactions coefficients @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results serve as a proof of principle that the method of displacement transformations can be used to study interacting fermion models . in the supplementary information we also applied our method to a different model@xcite . in future work </S>",
    "<S> we will apply this method to extract new physical results for various models .    </S>",
    "<S> _ outlook - _ we introduced a sequence of displacement transformations that allows for the diagonalization of an interacting fermionic hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this method suggests we can bring _ any _ charge - conserving hamiltonian into the classical form of eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ liom ] ) , not limited to the many - body localized phase@xcite or @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , even the completely nonlocal fermi liquids@xcite can be analyzed using the classical model@xcite @xmath92 where the integrals of motion @xmath93 are now local in momentum space and thus delocalized in real space . </S>",
    "<S> this begs the question how our method is related to the notion of integrability . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ liom ] ) quantum integrability depends on the number of parameters @xmath94 that are nonzero , following the definition of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : if a subexponential or less number of parameters are nonzero and independent , the system is integrable . note that this case of sparse uncorrelated coupling constants also implies poissonian level statistics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method thus most effectively applies to systems close to integrability . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an open interesting question how ergodic systems are represented in the @xmath95-basis of eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ liom ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible fruitful future endeavor would be to recast the iterative transformations in the language of an analytic renormalization scheme , much like the strong disorder renormalization group theory@xcite , for which a related version has been constructed for mbl systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar method using a hilbert space preserving rg scheme has been introduced by you  et  al@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that they keep interaction terms of all orders , and instead treat the off - diagonal resonance perturbatively to second order .    even though the final classical hamiltonian is of a remarkable simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , it does not imply easy solutions since in principle there could be long - range effective interactions between the classical bits @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , some complexity of the initial hamiltonian is transferred to the transformation operator @xmath88 , which is needed to translate any physical operator into the @xmath95-basis . yet </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we can explicitly derive @xmath88 using the renormalization scheme described in this letter , introduces a novel quantitative tool for the study of strongly interacting quantum matter .    _ </S>",
