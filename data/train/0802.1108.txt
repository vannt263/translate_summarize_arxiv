    "the minima of the parabolas and fractional periodicity are related to the change in angular momentum state as the flux is increased through the ring . in the @xmath9 limit , the ground - state bethe ansatz solution becomes that of the anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg chain,@xcite thereby justifying both the rigid - rotator description and anti - ferromagnetism seen in the continuum model results.@xcite    the present work explores the fractional periodicity in flux - penetrated @xmath0 ring systems .",

    "part b of section iii shows an application of the physics of the flux penetrated @xmath0 ring by determining the correspondence between it and the continuum model results for a few - particle , @xmath1 hard - wall quantum dot .",
    "the criteria for this correspondence are given together with a discussion of the underlying physical mechanisms which lead to these results .",
    "section iv concludes the main findings of this work .",
    "the hamiltonian for the single - band , flux - penetrated @xmath0 ring is @xmath18 here , @xmath19 @xmath20 creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath21 at site @xmath22 in the system and @xmath23 is the number operator . the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath13 are nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping terms , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25-site ring system is penetrated by magnetic flux @xmath5 , which is encapsulated in the hopping part of the hamiltonian , such that , @xmath26 the interaction term is the local coulomb interaction between opposite spins , the hubbard @xmath27 .",
    "all parameters are specified in arbitrary units of energy and relative to the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter , @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath28 shows the geometry of the @xmath0 ring with flux penetration .",

    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 refer to the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons , respectively .",
    "as only small system sizes are considered , the eigenproblem remains computationally tractable and can be solved by exact diagonalization using the arpack solver.@xcite the ground - state energy @xmath38 and persistent current @xmath39 are investigated as a function of @xmath5 , where @xmath40 to determine the magnetic state of the system , the total spin @xmath41 is calculated . the local moment , @xmath42 ,",
    "is used to measure the degree of spin localization . for a quarter - filled chain the local moment has a maximum value of @xmath43 .",
    "before discussing the physics of the flux - penetrated @xmath0 ring , it will be necessary to review the flux penetrated hubbard chain as this will provide an important base comparison for the @xmath0 extended model . in fig .",
    "@xmath45 , the ground - state energy as a function of the flux is shown for an @xmath46-site hubbard ring at quarter - filling .",
    "the results are for three different interaction strengths , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the periodicity in the ground - state energy is found to change from @xmath50 to @xmath6 as the interaction strength is increased to large values and approaches perfect fractional periodicity as @xmath51 . at large interaction strengths , e.g. , at @xmath52 , the angular momentum values at the minimum of the parabolas",
    "follow the expected @xmath11 relation .",
    "thus the @xmath53 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 angular momentum states , for example , correspond to @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .    in fig .",
    "@xmath61 , the persistent current is shown for the @xmath52 hubbard ring . the change in positive to negative",
    "current corresponds to the minima of the parabolas in fig .",
    "the jump from minimum to maximum current is indicative of the change in angular momentum state of this system .",
    "the amplitude of the persistent current is seen to be almost constant as a function of the penetrating flux .",
    "this near - perfect fractional periodicity corresponds to the system being an  effective rigid - rotator \" . at @xmath62 , perfect fractional periodicity and , hence",
    ", full rigid rotation would occur . in this case",
    ", the amplitude of the persistent current would be constant .",
    "@xmath54 shows the ground - state energy for the quarter - filled @xmath0 system as a function of flux , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the application of the small @xmath16 term is found to induce marked differences in the ground - state energy as a function of the flux strength , thus , demonstrating the sensitivity of the solutions to small @xmath16 perturbation .",
    "an interesting deviation from the hubbard results occurs ",
    "namely , an early onset of the fractional periodicity with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "this effect is clearly evidenced in fig .",
    "@xmath65 by the appearance of the @xmath66 parabolas in the @xmath47 result . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the @xmath0 system becomes an effective rigid - rotator , which can be seen in the near - perfect fractional periodicity of the @xmath68 solution . in comparison , for the hubbard ring , larger values of the hubbard @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath69 )",
    "were required in order to achieve this effect .",
    "the hubbard results show that the fractional periodicity improves as a function of increasing hubbard @xmath27 strength . in the @xmath0 system",
    ", however , the fractional periodicity acquires its optimal state at moderate values of the hubbard @xmath27 . increasing @xmath17 for the @xmath0 system destroys the near - perfect fractional periodicity due to the ` freezing ' of the energetics in the @xmath70 result as a function of increasing @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", the energy corresponding to the ground - state solution at @xmath70 remains the same for @xmath71 .",
    "inspection of the total spin as a function of @xmath17 at @xmath70 shows that the system has undergone a magnetic transition at @xmath67 , from a @xmath72 to a @xmath73 fully - polarized ferromagnetic spin state .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition can be confirmed by comparing the energies corresponding to the lowest energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 spin states at @xmath70 , as a function of increasing @xmath17 . at @xmath47",
    ", the ground - state has @xmath72 with an energy gap of 0.12 to the next state , which is @xmath73 . at @xmath74 , the lowest energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 spin states are near degenerate ",
    "the @xmath73 ferromagnetic spin state being the ground - state solution .",
    "away from this point at @xmath52 , the ferromagnetic @xmath73 ground - state persists , with the magnitude of the energy difference between the lowest energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 spin states , again , being @xmath75 .",
    "the freezing of the energetics at @xmath70 is therefore related to the removal of hubbard @xmath27 effects in the fully - polarized ( ferromagnetic ) state  in this case , no double occupancy and hence hubbard @xmath27 contribution can occur .",
    "the onset of effective rigid rotation and near - perfect fractional periodicity corresponds to a system where the spins are well localized .",
    "thus , the local moments for the @xmath73 ferromagnetic spin - state at @xmath70 reach the maximum value of @xmath76 . at @xmath77 ,",
    "the local moment results are @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath55 summarizes the local moment results for the @xmath0 system at @xmath80 , for the @xmath81 ( hubbard ) and @xmath64 cases .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition for the @xmath64 system is indicated by a change in spin - state to the fully - polarized @xmath73 state , together with a corresponding jump in the local moment to the maximum value of @xmath82 .",
    "compared to this result , the @xmath81 ( hubbard ) solutions show a smooth evolution of the @xmath80 state with respect to the local moment solutions and no change in the @xmath72 spin - state of the system .    fig .",
    "@xmath83 shows how the effective rigid - rotator feature of the @xmath0 system evolves as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "increasing the magnitude of @xmath16 to @xmath84 decreases the effective rigid rotation value of @xmath17 to @xmath85 .",
    "the onset of effective rigid rotation again corresponds to a ferromagnetic transition to the fully - polarized @xmath86 state and freezing of the energetics in the @xmath70 results .",
    "consequently , the local moment solutions at @xmath70 with @xmath87 have maximum values of @xmath82 , with local moment results for the @xmath79 and @xmath88 solutions being @xmath89 in these cases .    in general , calculations for the @xmath0 system as a function of @xmath16 reveal an inverse relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 with respect to the onset of near - perfect fractional periodicity and effective rigid rotation .",
    "table i shows the point of onset of effective rigid rotation as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note , this onset also corresponds to the ferromagnetic @xmath90 transition in the @xmath80 result .",
    "the inverse relation between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameters seen in table i and corresponding ferromagnetic transition are in accordance with the known properties of the quarter - filled @xmath0 chain  namely that the critcal parameter setting for ferromagnetism occurs when @xmath91see ref .  .",

    "for example , the values for @xmath93 are @xmath102 and @xmath105 respectively . the relative closeness in energy in these solutions",

    "this is also reflected in table i in the corresponding reduction in the local moment results .    in summary ,",
    "effective rigid rotation in the @xmath0 ring can be defined by the following three criteria ,    @xmath116 near - perfect @xmath6 fractional periodicity , with energy minima occurring at values of @xmath11 .",
    "these features are characterized by the relative closeness in the energy minima of the parabolas as defined by @xmath93 and can be accounted for by the freezing out of the @xmath17 energetics at @xmath70 , together with a minimum hubbard @xmath27 contribution at other @xmath11 values . @xmath117 an @xmath90 ferromagnetic transition , which occurs at @xmath70 , and @xmath118 maximum or near - maximum values in the local moments determined at these points .",

    "in particular , the @xmath47 , @xmath0 solution shows double the number of peaks compared to the hubbard solution .",
    "early onset of effective rigid rotation is also evident , and this is characterized by equal amplitude peaks in the @xmath121 function . of significance are the similarities in the results for the hubbard system at @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "@xmath119 ) and the @xmath0 system at @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "@xmath120)both showing effective rigid rotation .",
    "characteristic of the @xmath0 system is that it undergoes a ferromagnetic transition leading to the freezing of the energetics at @xmath122 .",
    "in addition , at @xmath123 the energetics continue to evolve beyond the point of effective rigid rotation .",
    "this leads to a distinctive feature in the persistent current curve , namely in the formation of signal ` clusters ' consisting of the same number of peaks as there are particles in the system .",
    "an example of such a cluster is shown in fig .",

    "the choice of the hard - wall potential is motivated by the aim of having extended ring - shaped electronic structures with ferromagnetic ground - state solutions .",
    "this potential has been used in ref .   to study the effect of confinement on the magneto - optical spectrum of a qd , and in refs . and to study the electronic structure of a qd in a strong magnetic field , using a mean - field density - functional method .",
    "the most common choice of potential for quantum dots , the parabolic potential , is not a feasible choice as the ground - states are not ring - shaped in the regime of interest .",
    "in addition , the ground - states are not ferromagnetic without a strong zeeman term , despite the effects of landau level mixing @xcite .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , in ref .  , which shows exact diagonalization results for electrons in a parabolic confinement , treated in the lowest - landau - level approximation .",

    "these cases were compared to quarter - filled @xmath46- and @xmath187-site @xmath0 systems , respectively .",
    "the results for the maximum overlaps between the continuum and lattice model results are shown in tables ii and iii . here , the @xmath211 values denote the total amount of magnetic flux that is penetrating the dot . for the 4-particle case , these values correspond to the flux values indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7](a ) .",
    "a similar choice of flux values was made for the @xmath83-particle system .",
    "the maximum overlaps were determined for the first period in @xmath12 , commencing at the mdd states , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , for the @xmath55- and @xmath83-particle systems , respectively .",
    "the results were obtained by careful scanning through the @xmath17 and @xmath16 parameter ranges .",
    "maximum overlaps as a function of @xmath12 for the @xmath55-particle system were found to occur at @xmath214 and @xmath215 and for the @xmath83-particle system at @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the dominant difference in these results lies in the strength of the hubbard @xmath27 .",
    "a larger @xmath17 value for the 4-particle system is consistent with what is known in the continuum model description of quantum rings , namely that these systems become more interaction dominated when they contain fewer particles . given the similar magnitude of @xmath16 in both the @xmath55-particle and @xmath83-particle cases , it seems apparent that the role of this parameter is therefore to simulate the correct extended geometry of the ring .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased , the continuum model systems become more ring - like , losing some of these extended system qualities .",
    "thus , for larger @xmath12 , the maximum overlaps for both the @xmath55- and @xmath83-particles cases are found to slightly decrease .    in figs .",
    "@xmath183 and @xmath187 the ground - state energy results as a function of flux for the 8-site and 10-site @xmath0 ring systems are shown with the choice of @xmath16 values being the same as those which were required to achieve maximum overlap .",
    "the values of @xmath17 required for maximum overlap occur after the point of effective rigid rotation in both of these cases . from the lattice model perspective , this result shows that the system has undergone the ferromagnetic transition required to initiate effective rigid rotation . the total spin progression for both the continuum and lattice model systems as a function of @xmath12 therefore follows that of the flux - penetrated ferromagnetic heisenberg model , namely , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , for the 4-particle and 5-particle cases .",
    "the high correspondence between the continuum and lattice model systems , being between @xmath220 , demonstrates clearly that , similar to the @xmath0 system , the additional degree of kinetic freedom and extended ring - like geometry are the important factors which are responsible for the ferromagnetism seen in the continuum model results .    in summary ,",
    "to encapsulate the correct physics and the kinetics in the continuum qd system , the @xmath0 lattice needs to be double in size and hence quarter - filled with respect to the total particle number . to obtain maximum overlap",
    ", the lattice model needs to have evolved beyond the point of rigid rotation , which is denoted by the onset of a ferromagnetic phase , thus corresponding to the ferromagnetism seen in the continuum model results .",
    "the flux - penetrated @xmath0 , @xmath4 system at quarter - filling has been investigated as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameterization .",
    "the results indicate an onset of effective rigid rotation in this system , which occurs for moderate @xmath17 values , and coincides with a ferromagnetic transition . this model has been used to explain the essential physics of the continuum model results for a few particle , @xmath1 quantum dot . for @xmath55- and @xmath83-particle cases , the maximum overlaps between the continuum and lattice model wavefunctions give between @xmath220 correspondence .",
    "the ferromagnetism , which is seen in the continuum model solutions , can be explained by the additional kinetics and extended ring - like geometry .",
    "the results suggest the possibility of anti - ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic switching from strictly @xmath4 to extended quantum ring systems .",
    "in addition , a decrease in the order of magnitude of the hilbert space size in the lattice model compared to the continuum model indicates that the lattice model may be a more efficient method of determining the ground - state properties and essential physics of extended ring qd systems .",
