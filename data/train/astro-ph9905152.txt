    "dwingeloo 1 ( dw1 ) is a large sbb / c galaxy , discovered both in a systematic hi emission survey of the northern part of the milky way in search of obscured galaxies in the zone of avoidance by kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and independently by huchtmeier et al .",
    "the knowledge of the local mass distribution has implications for the peculiar velocity field , the direction and amplitude of the local group acceleration , the determination of parameters such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and on the understanding of the formation and evolution of groups of galaxies ( e.g. , peebles 1994 ; marinoni et al .",
    "the discovery of this galaxy proved a long standing suspicion that the tidal disruptions of maffei 2 may be due to the presence of another massive galaxy nearby ( e.g. , hurt et al . 1993 ) .",
    "dw1 lies in the direction of the ic  342/maffei 1 & 2 group of galaxies , about 2 degrees away from maffei 2 .",
    "this corresponds to a physical separation of 175kpc assuming that dw1 and maffei 2 are at a distance of 5mpc .",
    "being the nearest barred spiral system , dw1 offers a unique possibility to study the effect of the bar at high spatial resolution .",
    "the discoverers classified dw1 as an sbb or sbc galaxy ( t=4 ) and measured an angular diameter of 4.2arcmin .",
    "later on , mccall & buta ( 1997 ) re - classified it to sb(s)cd with an angular diameter of 9.9arcmin at @xmath10mag arcsec@xmath11 based on deep optical @xmath12-band imaging .",
    "burton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) extensively studied the neutral hydrogen content of dw1 and measured hi profile widths at 20% and 50% level of @xmath13 km s@xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath14 respectively .",
    "the measured inclination of the gaseous disk was @xmath16degrees and the position angle 112degrees , with the major axis aligned with the bar .    since the discovery of dw1 the determination of its distance has been hampered by the poorly known galactic extinction .",
    "optical @xmath17 imaging , long slit spectroscopy , and _ iras _ observations were summarized by loan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used a number of methods to estimate the foreground extinction towards dw1 .",
    "the optical color excesses yielded @xmath18,mag , the measured galactic hi column density @xmath19mag , and the @xmath20 m _ iras _ flux @xmath21mag .",
    "finally , they applied optical @xmath12 and @xmath22-band tully - fisher relations to obtain distances ranging from 1.3 to 6.7mpc , with an average value of about 4mpc ( assuming @xmath23",
    "km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 ) .",
    "their main source of uncertainty was the value of the galactic extinction .",
    "phillipps & davies ( 1997 ) challenged these extreme distance estimates on the basis of the very narrow span of central surface brightness in present day spiral galaxies .",
    "their best estimate for the extinction ( @xmath24mag ) places dw1 at a distance of @xmath25mpc .",
    "these authors also employed the diameter version of the tully - fisher relation ( persic , salucci , & stel 1996 ) and obtained a distance of 2.7mpc .",
    "the primary goal of this study was to put stronger constraints on the foreground extinction , and to obtain a better estimate of the distance to dw1 .",
    "we chose to use infrared colors because of their small intrinsic variations among spiral galaxies ( aaronson 1977 ) .",
    "in addition , the extinction in the @xmath0-band is about three times smaller than in the @xmath12-band and about six times smaller than in the @xmath26-band ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "finally , the infrared tully - fisher ( irtf ) relation shows a smaller intrinsic scatter than its optical counterpart ( aaronson , huchra , & mould 1979 ; freedman 1990 ; peletier & willner 1993 ) . the irtf relation allows us to determine both the extinction and the distance at the same wavelength range , minimizing the errors arising from possible variations of the reddening law .",
    "we obtained @xmath27 imaging of dw1 using a @xmath28 nicmos3 array at the 2.3-m bok telescope of the university of arizona on kitt peak , with a plate scale of @xmath29arcsec pixel@xmath14 during a number of observing runs .",
    "we constructed a deep @xmath1 @xmath0-band mosaic of dw1 , whereas the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images only covered the central @xmath30 .",
    "additional @xmath0-band imaging using a @xmath31 array and plate scale @xmath32arcsec pixel@xmath14 was obtained at the same telescope on a subsequent observing run to calibrate the deep @xmath0-band imaging . the observational strategy consisted of taking galaxy images interleaved with sky images",
    "@xmath33 away from dw1 .",
    "details of the observations are listed in table  1 .",
    "the data reduction included subtraction of dark current frames , flat - fielding with median combined empty sky frames , and sky subtraction .",
    "the mosaics were constructed by shifting the images to a common position with cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the photometric calibration was performed using observations of standard stars from the lists of elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and hunt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) when conditions were photometric .",
    "conditions were non - photometric for the @xmath0-band mosaic , and this image was self - calibrated using the @xmath34 data . in the next section we will be making use of infrared colors of spiral galaxies to derive an estimate of the extinction to dw1 . the colors for spiral galaxies were obtained with the @xmath35-band filter , whereas our measurements were taken with the @xmath3 ( short-@xmath35 ) filter .",
    "therefore it is necessary to determine what the difference is between the two filters . very recently",
    "persson et al . (",
    "1998 ) have obtained a new set of @xmath36 photometric standards . in their study",
    "the average difference between the @xmath35 and @xmath3 magnitudes ( for the red standards ) is 0.0096mag , with a standard deviation of 0.017mag .",
    "we assume that the use of the @xmath3 filter instead of the @xmath35 filter introduces an extra uncertainty in the photometric calibration of this filter of @xmath37mag .",
    "the errors associated with the photometric calibration are 0.05 , 0.07 , 0.06 mag in @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 respectively .    in figure  1",
    "we display the @xmath0-band mosaic on a logarithmic scale .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , there is a large number of foreground stars which need to be removed prior to analyzing the data .",
    "the star removal from the @xmath27 images was done interactively .",
    "the affected pixels were then replaced with a linear surface fit to a circular annulus around each star .",
    "the automatic procedures failed largely because of psf variations under non - photometric conditions . a bright star located southwest of the galaxy posed a major problem , and was masked out throughout the data reduction .",
    "we assumed radial symmetry and replaced the region within about 90 arcsec from the star with the data from the opposite side of the galaxy .",
    "we performed the photometry on the _ cleaned _ images measuring the flux within elliptical isophotes with fixed position angle and ellipticity as determined from hi observations ( burton et al .",
    "the surface brightness profiles in @xmath27 are given in table  2 , and displayed in figure  2 along with the radial distribution of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors , and the total apparent magnitudes in @xmath27 . in both table  2 and figure  2",
    "the error bars represent the combined @xmath41 variations from photon statistics , sky background variations , the elliptical isophotal fitting , and the photometric calibration . from the radial distribution of the colors ,",
    "it is clear that the center of the galaxy appears slightly redder than the outer regions , as it is the case with the infrared colors of most spiral galaxies ( terndrup et al .",
    "1994 ; de jong 1996 ) .",
    "loan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report inverse optical color gradients in dw1 , however , this may be the result of active star formation along the bar as found in some barred spirals ( shaw et al .",
    "1995 ) .    before we tried to obtain an estimate of the extinction using the infrared colors , we fitted straight lines to assess the variation of the colors with increasing apertures ,    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath22 is the semi - major axis in units of arcmin .",
    "these color gradients imply a change of @xmath45mag within the inner 2arcmin of dw1 , which may cause significant uncertainties in the reddening estimate .",
    "the smaller field of view of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images prevents us from obtaining the total colors of dw1 .",
    "however , the total flux in the @xmath27 bands is dominated by the inner @xmath46-diameter region ( see figure  2 , bottom panel ) .",
    "hence , we adopt the total observed colors at radial distance of 1 arcmin from the center of the galaxy to be representative for the whole galaxy ( @xmath47mag , @xmath48mag , @xmath49mag ) . to estimate the color excesses we compared these colors to the mean integrated colors of sbb - sbcd galaxies : @xmath50mag , @xmath51mag , @xmath52mag ( aaronson 1977 ) .",
    "we have increased the errors in aaronson s colors to account for the uncertain hubble type of dw1 .",
    "the color excesses were converted into @xmath0-band ( @xmath53 ) , visual ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55-band ( @xmath56 ) extinctions using rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 , rl85 ) and mathis ( 1990 , m90 ) extinction laws .",
    "the results are summarized in table  3 .",
    "henceforth we will use @xmath57mag from mathis ( 1990 ) extinction law for the sake of compatibility with previous work .",
    "this value is close to the estimate based on the _ iras _ @xmath20 m flux ( loan et al .",
    "1996 ) .    finally , we used the combined optical - near infrared colors to verify our result .",
    "loan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported the following total apparent ( not corrected for reddening ) magnitudes for dw 1 : @xmath58mag , @xmath59mag , and @xmath60mag .",
    "we measured a total @xmath0-band magnitude @xmath61mag , and compared the observed colors with the intrinsic colors as determined by de jong ( 1996 ) : @xmath62mag , @xmath63mag , and @xmath64mag .",
    "mathis ( 1990 ) extinction law yields @xmath65mag , @xmath66mag , and @xmath67mag respectively , in good agreement with our infrared estimates .      in order to determine the distance to dw1",
    ", we chose to apply the irtf relation because of its lower intrinsic dispersion and the reduced extinction in the @xmath0-band , with the additional advantage that the extinction and the distance are estimated at the same wavelength .",
    "the irtf relation was pioneered by aaronson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) . however , we chose to employ the irtf relation calibrated by freedman ( 1990 ) using local galaxies with cepheid based distances , and the relations of peletier & willner ( 1993 ) calibrated relative to the distance of the ursa major galaxy cluster .",
    "freedman s ( 1990 ) calibration for the irtf relation leads to the following expression : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the inclination corrected @xmath70 level hi velocity profile width in km s@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath71 is the absolute @xmath0-band magnitude within a circular aperture with diameter @xmath72 , for which @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being the @xmath55-band isophotal diameter at @xmath75mag arcsec@xmath11 . using @xmath76 km s@xmath14 , which is burton et al.s ( 1996 ) value corrected for the inclination of the galaxy ,",
    "the above expression predicts an absolute @xmath0-band magnitude @xmath77mag .",
    "although @xmath55-band surface photometry for dw1 is not available , we can make use of the intrinsic integrated colors for sb - sc galaxies @xmath78 ( de jong 1996 ) to estimate @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75mag arcsec@xmath11 isophote corresponds to an @xmath0-band surface brightness ( corrected for extinction ) of @xmath79mag arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "taking into account the @xmath0-band extinction this is equivalent to an observed ( not corrected for extinction ) value of @xmath80mag arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  2 ( upper panel ) , this value exceeds the boundaries of the @xmath0-band mosaic .",
    "however , the surface brightness profile can be easily extrapolated .",
    "we fitted an exponential disk ( @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the semi - major axis and @xmath83 is the disk scale length ) to the surface brightness profile from a radial distance of 2arcmin outwards where the bulge contribution in negligible , and estimated a value of @xmath84 arcmin .",
    "the apparent @xmath0-band magnitude ( not corrected for extinction ) for a circular aperture with diameter of @xmath85arcmin is then @xmath86mag , which provides a distance modulus of @xmath87 and a distance of @xmath7mpc .",
    "the irtf relation was initially calibrated for circular apertures because only single - pixel detectors were used at the time ( aaronson , huchra , & mould 1979 ) .",
    "naturally , one would expect a transition to elliptical apertures to reduce the internal dispersion of the irtf relation because they correct for the galaxy inclination .",
    "peletier & willner ( 1993 ) studied the problem in detail and reported no significant change in the calibration of the irtf relation when elliptical apertures were used .",
    "a possible explanation is that the higher internal absorption , which increases with inclination , may cancel out the projection effect .",
    "peletier & willner ( 1993 ) used elliptical apertures and obtained the following calibration for spiral galaxies in the ursa major galaxy cluster : @xmath88 .",
    "we used a distance modulus to ursa major cluster of @xmath89mag ( pierce & tully 1988 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath90mag .",
    "however , we are still left with the problem of extrapolating the observed total luminosity profile out to @xmath74 . the measured total",
    "( not corrected for extinction ) @xmath0-band magnitude within an elliptical aperture with major axis @xmath91arcmin and axial ratio 1.56 ( loan et al .",
    "1996 ) is @xmath92mag . correcting for the reddening",
    ", we obtained a distance modulus of @xmath93mag and distance @xmath94mpc .",
    "the intrinsic spread of peletier & willner ( 1993 ) irtf relation and the uncertain distance to the ursa major cluster account for the increased errors of this estimate .",
    "we can now use our reddening estimate to correct the optical @xmath12 and @xmath22-band photometry of loan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and use the optical tully - fisher relations to obtain another distance estimate .",
    "the two reddening laws discussed in the preceding section predict the same @xmath95/@xmath53 ratio within a few percent . adopting mathis ( 1990 ) extinction law , we find @xmath12- and @xmath55-band extinctions of @xmath96mag , and @xmath97mag lower than @xmath98mag in loan et al .",
    "this puts dw1 at an average distance of @xmath99 mpc .",
    "these distance determinations place dw1 behind ngc  1560 at @xmath100mpc , ugca  105 at @xmath101mpc ( krismer , tully , & gioia 1995 ) , and maffei 1 at @xmath102mpc ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) .",
    "we have obtained deep near - infrared imaging of the highly obscured galaxy dw1 .",
    "the observed infrared colors were used to obtain a very accurate estimate of the extinction in the @xmath0-band , @xmath103mag .",
    "this value was confirmed by the optical - near infrared color excesses , and is close to the estimate based on the _ iras _ @xmath20 m flux ( loan et al .",
    "our approach is more reliable than previous works in that we did not make any additional assumptions for the relation between @xmath54 and hi , or the _ iras _ @xmath20 m emission .",
    "in addition , the irtf relation allowed us to estimate both the reddening and distance at the same wavelength range .",
    "this makes our results largely independent of the choice of the reddening law , with the additional advantage that the irtf shows a smaller dispersion than its optical counterpart .",
    "finally , the infrared reddening estimates are more reliable than those in the optical because infrared colors of spiral galaxies show a smaller intrinsic dispersion , and are less sensitive to the history of star formation than optical colors ( vazdekis et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the irtf relation ( freedman 1990 ) yielded a distance of @xmath7mpc which places dw1 at the far end of the ic  342/maffei  1 & 2 group .",
    "we also confirmed that dw1 has an angular diameter greater than 7 arcmin , larger than the originally measured value of 4.2 arcmin .    during the course of this work vdi and aa - h",
