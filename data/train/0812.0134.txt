    "atmospheric blocking is a fundamental large - scale weather phenomena in mid - high latitudes in the atmosphere that has a profound effect on local and regional climates .",
    "the life cycle of an atmospheric blocking always brings about large - scale weather or short terms climate anomalies .",
    "therefore , it is rather important to predict an atmospheric blocking in regional midterm weather forecast and short - term climate trend prediction .",
    "there are three types of patterns for an atmospheric blocking anticyclone , i. e. , monopole type blocking ( or omega type blocking ) , dipole type blocking , and multi - pole type blocking . during the past many years , the dipole type blocking has been studied a lot since its first discovery by rex @xcite .",
    "malguzzi and malanotte - rizzoli first used the korteweg de - vries ( kdv ) rossby soliton theory to study dipole type blocking . while unfortunately their analytical results failed to describe the onset , developing , and decay of a blocking system .",
    "in fact , the important atmospheric blocking can be explained by many different theories except for kdv type equations .",
    "recently , luo et al . proposed the envelope rossby soliton theory based on the deduced nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type equations and successfully explained the blocking life cycle numerically .",
    "more recently , we have found that variable coefficient kdv equation can analytically features the life cycle of a dipole blocking if introducing a time - dependent background field @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite that none zero boundary values and time - dependent background westerly are vital factors to explain a life cycle of a dipole type blocking .    in this paper , we are motivated to introduce time into the background flow and boundary conditions to derive new types of equations from a two - layered fluid to investigate atmospheric blocking systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a type of coupled variable coefficient modified kdv type system is derived from a two - layered fluid model .",
    "then we give a special analytical solution with many arbitrary functions and constants in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we assume some special values of the parameters in the analytical solution to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the stream functions which can describe a typical monopole type blocking event .",
    "the whole life cycle of the monopole blocking is graphically displayed , which really captures the feature of a real observational monopole blocking case happened in the 2008 snow storm in china .",
    "last section is a short summary and discussion .",
    "the starting two - layered fluid model is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in eqs .",
    " , @xmath3 is a weak coupling constant between two layers of the fluid and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the earth s radius , @xmath7 is the angular frequency of the earth s rotation and @xmath8 is the latitude , @xmath9 is the characteristic velocity scale .",
    "the derivation of the dimensionless equations and is based on the characteristic horizontal length scale @xmath10 m and the characteristic horizontal velocity scale @xmath11 m/s @xcite .",
    "a type of coupled kdv equations has been derived from the system - , and its painlev property and soliton solutions have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "it is a common treatment to rewrite the stream function @xmath12 by two parts , namely , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the background flow term , introduce the stretched variables @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 is a constant ) , and take the background field @xmath14 only as a linear function of @xmath17 , and then expand the stream function as @xmath18 . recently ,",
    "considering the fact that background flow and the shear of the flow both could be time dependent , a new treatment was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite to view background field @xmath19 as a function arbitrarily depending on @xmath20 and then further expand it as @xmath21 .",
    "below , a new type of coupled variable coefficient modified kdv type system is derived in a different way from that used in ref .",
    "first , we introduce a variable transformation @xmath22 , and denote @xmath23 .",
    "then , we rewrite the stream functions @xmath24 with the stretched variables @xmath25 , ( @xmath16 is a constant ) , and finally make the expansions @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , we introduce @xmath28 .",
    "then we substitute all the expansions into eqs . and with eqs . and ,",
    "and then vanish all the coefficients of each order of @xmath29 . for notation simplicity ,",
    "the primes are dropped out in the following .    in the first order of @xmath29",
    ", we obtain @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the general solutions of eqs . and read @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 are arbitrary integration functions of @xmath38 .    in the second order of @xmath29 , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 are determined by a system of equations presented in appendix a.    in the third order of @xmath29 ,",
    "if we assume @xmath41 and requiring @xmath42 satisfy a system of equations ( we do not write them down here for they are too long while can be easily retrieved following the above procedures ) , then we arrive at a coupled variable coefficient modified kdv type system @xmath43 with @xmath44 being arbitrary functions of the indicated variable .",
    "since equations - constitute a coupled variable coefficient nonlinear system , it is not easy to obtain its general solution . here",
    "we present a quite special solution of the system .",
    "it is easy to see that if we suppose @xmath45 with constant @xmath46 , then eqs . and",
    "degenerate to one modified kdv type equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 when @xmath50    further , it can be verified that the modified kdv equation can be transformed to the standard one @xmath51 if @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 are arbitrary functions , with conditions @xmath57 hence , it is easy to obtain exact solutions of eq .",
    "based on the solutions of eq . through eq . with eq . .",
    "one classical soliton solution of the mkdv equation is @xmath58 with a constant @xmath59 .",
    "now just using this typical solution , we can easily write down a special solution of the original system - as @xmath60\\right\\},\\label{repsi1}\\\\ & & \\psi_2\\approx u_0(a_{22}y,\\tau)+\\epsilon u_1(a_{22}y,\\tau)+\\epsilon b_2(a_{22}y,\\tau)\\left\\{c_1\\epsilon(a_{11}x+a_{12}y - c_0 t ) -\\frac{m_6f_1f_2 ^ 2}{2a^2f_{4\\tau}}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad \\left.+f_2k{\\rm sech}\\left[\\frac{6kf_1\\epsilon}{\\beta_0 ^ 2a^2}(a_{11}x+a_{12}y - c_0t)-\\frac{3kf_3}{2a^4 } -k^3f_4\\right]\\right\\},\\label{repsi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 determined by eqs . and , respectively . from the analytical solution of stream functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , it is easy to derive the corresponding background westerly flows @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , which are all left as arbitrary functions of the indicated variables .",
    "by selecting the arbitrary functions and constants appropriately , the approximate analytical solution - can be responsible for different kinds of atmospheric blocking phenomenon . here",
    "we give a typical example when the functions and constants are taken as @xmath66 in this case , the solution can describe a monopole type blocking event as depicted in figure [ fig ] .",
    "considering the fact that the basic flow , mainly the basic westerly and the shear of the basic westerly , plays a significant role on the blocking developing process @xcite , it is hence reasonable to introduce the @xmath67 related term .    , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] + , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] + , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]",
    "evidently , a whole life cycle of a monopole type blocking event , namely , the onset , development , maintenance , and decay processes , are clearly presented in figure [ fig ] .",
    "the streamlines are gradually deformed , and the anticyclonic high in the north develops at the second day ( fig .",
    "it is strengthened daily . at around the fourth day ( fig .",
    "1e ) , it is at its strongest stage and then become weaker and eventually disappear after the seventh day ( figs .",
    "1e - h ) . obviously , fig .",
    "1 possesses the phenomenon s salient features including their spatial - scale and structure , amplitude , life cycle , and duration .",
    "therefore , fig . 1 is a very typical monopole type blocking episode in one layer of the fluid .",
    "a real observational blocking case happened during 19 feb 2008 to 26 feb 2008 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] appearing a monopole pattern .",
    "it is easily found that the life cycle of this blocking lasts about eight days experiencing three stages : onset ( 19 - 20 feb , 2008 ) , mature ( 21 - 22 feb , 2008 ) and decay ( 23 - 26 feb , 2008 ) periods , which resembles those displayed in figure 1 .",
    "-axis is longitude , and the @xmath17-axis is latitude .",
    "contour interval is 6 gpdm.[fig2],width=453 ]",
    "considering a time - dependent basic westerly , we have derived a type of coupled variable coefficient modified kdv type system from a two - layered fluid model , with the time dependent coefficients resulted from the time dependent basic flows and time dependent boundary conditions .",
    "instead of possessing a linear meridional shear , the mean flow is assumed to be a combination of a quadratic function of @xmath17 and @xmath68 .",
    "the boundary conditions remain as unknown functions with some complicated relations . under a set of parameters , our analytical solution nicely described a real observational blocking life cycle from 19 feb to 26 feb 2008 , indicating the onset , mature and decay phases in its developing process in one of the layers of the fluid . in the other layer ,",
    "similar or different types of blocking can be found when setting the unknown parameters .",
    "therefore , it is revealed that blocking can also be governed by modified kdv type system and its analytical solutions can also features the life cycle of a blocking .",
    "it is worth further investigations on how variations of the time - dependent background westerlies influence the type of a blocking and the evolution of a blocking during its life period since the role of the weak westerlies on a blocking is still unclear .",
