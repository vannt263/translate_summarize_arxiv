    "the most popular approach to the theory of quantum dissipative systems  @xcite involves the _ system - plus - reservoir _ ( spr ) model  @xcite , where dissipation is assumed to arise from the interaction with a _ reservoir _ ( or environment , or bath ) ; the latter is constituted by very many degrees of freedom which are individually weakly perturbed by the system , so that  ( a ) the reservoir can be assumed to remain at thermal equilibrium and  ( b ) its degrees of freedom can be modeled as harmonic oscillators , which are  ( c ) linearly coupled with some system s observable .",
    "this observable is usually taken as a function of the system s coordinate only , and the case of _ strictly linear _",
    "dissipation corresponds to the case of a linear function .",
    "within such a model it is possible to show that the ( retarded ) dynamics of the system , once the bath variables are eliminated , is indeed described by a langevin equation  @xcite , where the dissipative memory function is connected to the characteristics of the bath and its coupling to the system .",
    "this contact between the microscopic details of the bath and the phenomenological description is valuable , as it allows to connect with the phenomenology the effects onto the quantum thermodynamics of the system .",
    "originally , the picture of a more or less fictitious harmonic bath was meant to give a physically sound tool for describing quantum dissipation : a hamiltonian quantization is made possible because the overall system including the bath is isolated . however , in several real cases it is possible to precisely devise the physical environment and its microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , a magnetic system is intrinsically coupled with its underlying lattice ; this is demonstrated by the observed occurrence of effects that can be as dramatic as to yield a lattice distortion ( _ spin - peierls _",
    "transition  @xcite ) .",
    "now , while the motion of the lattice ions can be fairly described in terms of linear excitations ( phonons ) , it is also possible to microscopically model the coupling between the spins and the ion positions , so that the vibrating lattice can be eventually treated as an environmental bath for the spins . within this picture",
    "one could expect and theoretically calculate observable modifications of the behavior of quantum magnets , such as a shift of the predicted critical temperature  @xcite . as spin hamiltonians",
    "are often dealt with through a spin - boson transformation reducing spin operators to ordinary canonical variables , thinking of a possible environmental coupling would symmetrically involve both the coordinates and the momenta , with no privileged role : this has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the easy - axis xxz magnet .",
    "therefore it is necessary to generalize the concept of the dissipative system in a much more general way than it was done when considering _ anomalous _ dissipation  @xcite , where the bath is assumed to be coupled with the momentum .",
    "such a generalization has been used for studying the coherence properties of a magnetic impurity in a ferromagnetic environment  @xcite : it has been shown that some quantum effects of the two baths partially cancel , leading to a persistence of coherence that has been called _ quantum frustration _ of decoherence  @xcite , and this motivated for a more detailed study of the dynamics of the quantum oscillator coupled with two baths  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic behavior that follows from the intrinsic dynamical character of quantum thermodynamics . indeed , besides the dynamical features studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , one expects that also the system s static quantities could exhibit effects that witness for _ quantum frustration_. the present work gives an overview of the different  sometimes unexpected  features that a generalized environmental coupling can produce .",
    "from previous studies it is well known that , roughly speaking , the quantum fluctuations of the variable to which the bath is attached are quenched and those of its conjugate variable are enhanced , in such a way that the heisenberg uncertainty principle holds .",
    "however , it is not clear which would be the prevailing effect when attaching one or two independent baths to both canonical variables , especially when the coupling has an equivalent weight onto coordinate and momentum ( _ symmetric coupling _ ) .",
    "we are going here to answer such questions by assuming the simultaneous existence of environmental coupling with both canonical variables , taking an exactly solvable reference system , i.e. , the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we will find that the presence of a symmetric environmental coupling generally enhances the quantum fluctuations of coordinate and momentum , but that this does not necessarily occur in a monotonic way with the coupling strength .",
    "moreover , as such phenomena can show up in a qualitatively similar way in nonlinear systems , one can think of the possibility of finding reentrant behavior driven by the environmental coupling strength , e.g. , when the system is close to a ( quantum ) phase transition .    in section  [ s.2b ] the framework of general environmental coupling",
    "is introduced considering two independent reservoirs coupled to the coordinate and to the momentum , while in section  [ s.1b ] the alternative case of one single bath coupled to both canonical variables is approached ; there , the main results for the environmental effects upon the mean - square fluctuations of the harmonic oscillator are reported and discussed for coupling with the only environment coordinates and also when the environmental momenta are involved . in section  [ s.concl ]",
    "we summarize the results and draw some conclusions and speculations about the possible implications of symmetric environmental coupling . in appendix  [ a.standard ]",
    "the backbone of the standard theory of quantum dissipation is briefly reviewed by recalling the definition of relevant quantities and setting the formalism adopted in this paper ; appendix  [ a.gintegral ] reports the details of the evaluation of the general gaussian path integral repeatedly used throughout the paper .",
    "we consider as system of interest a quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath0 where we prefer to introduce two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the place of the commonly used mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 , in such a way to emphasize the symmetry between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath7 , i.e. , the commutator @xmath8=1 $ ] .",
    "as motivated in the introduction , we wish here consider the case of two baths , one coupled with the coordinate and one with the momentum . the known results summarized in appendix  [ a.standard ]",
    "tell us that the two independent baths are in conflict , so the first natural but nontrivial question is which effect prevails onto the mean - square fluctuations of , say , the coordinate .",
    "of course , the answer also depends on the relative intensities of the couplings ; however , if the bath couplings are _ identical _ , the behavior is not easily foreseeable .",
    "the equations of motion for the system s coordinate can be again put into the form of a langevin equation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 assuming @xmath15 and @xmath14 to vanish for @xmath20 and to be positive decreasing functions for @xmath21 , then @xmath22 also satisfies the condition of causality , but as @xmath23 the positivity of @xmath22 is not guaranteed .",
    "basically , this means that there is nt a standard phenomenological dissipative counterpart of our _ system - plus - two - reservoirs _ model .",
    "therefore , it is better to refer to the two - bath coupling as _ environmental _ , rather than _ dissipative _ , coupling .",
    "of course , in physical applications the baths and their interaction with the system have to be microscopically characterized .",
    "anyhow , since in the limit where one of the baths can be disregarded we expect a ( standard or anomalous ) dissipative behavior , we argue that a phenomenological form for both memory functions is physically reasonable ; we will make use of it later on .      eventually , including the isolated system s action and using the general result of appendix  [ a.gintegral ] one finds the partition function @xmath30 and the mean - square fluctuations @xmath31 which , as expected , are symmetrically related and reduce to the known forms in the limits of standard ( @xmath32 ) and anomalous ( @xmath33 ) dissipation .",
    "the summations in eqs .",
    "are convergent , provided that for large @xmath34 both kernels are such that @xmath35 . together with the result @xmath36 , eqs .",
    "fully determine the gaussian ( reduced ) density matrix corresponding to the oscillator hamiltonian   plus the environmental interaction  .",
    "the zeroth matsubara component of eqs .   coincides with the classical contribution to the mean - square fluctuations @xmath37 noting that the classical contribution is unaffected by the environment , it is useful to separate the remaining _ purely quantum _ contribution , which includes the whole environmental effect , @xmath38 for the isolated oscillator these quantities reduce to @xmath39 which look more familiar by noting that @xmath40",
    ".      let us consider the general expressions   for the purely quantum mean - square fluctuations . due to the interchangeability of the canonical variables , it is sufficient to study , say , the coordinate fluctuations only .    to proceed , we take the minimal phenomenological form for the memory function of each bath , i.e. , the _ drude _ model  @xcite , defined by @xmath41 and characterized by the intensity @xmath42 and the memory time @xmath43 .",
    "its laplace transform , to which the bath s kernel is related via eq .  , reads @xmath44 the drude cutoff frequency @xmath45 characterizes the environment and its interaction with the system , so it is expected to be of the order of the debye frequency in the case of a phonon bath . in the limit of vanishing memory time , i.e. , large @xmath46 , one recovers the so - called _ ohmic _ ( or _ markovian _ ) model , which is memoryless , @xmath47 .",
    "actually , a finite drude frequency is necessary in order to get finite results for both quantities in eqs .  ; on the other hand , it is indeed known that ohmic response is incompatible with quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the drude kernels we are going to use are then @xmath48 where for both kernels the same memory time @xmath43 is chosen for simplicity , while the amplitudes @xmath49 and @xmath50 will be varied independently .",
    "in addition , without loss of generality we can take a symmetric form for the oscillator hamiltonian  , i.e. , @xmath51 ; in this way both @xmath52 and @xmath53 are dimensionless .",
    "taking @xmath54 as the frequency unit leads to a natural dimensionless formulation , with the reduced temperature @xmath55 , the matsubara frequency @xmath56 , and so on ; all this is tantamount to setting @xmath57 , and in such units the classical part of the dimensionless fluctuations is equal to the temperature , @xmath58 .    therefore , the mean - square fluctuation we have to study is @xmath59 which has the dimensionless explicit expression @xmath60 with @xmath61 note that a nonzero memory time @xmath43 is required to make the series   convergent .      taking the limit @xmath62 ,",

    "however , an unexpected behavior shows up while rising the intensity of the environmental coupling : after an initial rise the mean - square fluctuation shows a maximum , whose location and intensity depends upon the drude memory time , and eventually slowly decreases back towards the isolated oscillator value @xmath86 .",
    "it is obvious that , as the size of the zero - temperature fluctuations is affected by the mechanism of environmental coupling , one could formally modulate its intensity @xmath42 to drive through a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) a system that is close to it . at difference with standard dissipative systems ,",
