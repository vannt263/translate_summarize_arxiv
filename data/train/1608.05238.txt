    "quantitative photoacoustic tomography is concerned with recovering quantitatively accurate estimates of chromophore concentration distributions , or related quantities such as optical coefficients or blood oxygenation , from photoacoustic images @xcite .",
    "the source of contrast in photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is optical absorption , which is directly related to the tissue constituents . by obtaining pat images at multiple optical wavelengths",
    ", it may be possible to recover chemically specific information about the tissue .",
    "however , such a spectroscopic use of pat images must consider the effect of the spatially and spectrally varying light fluence distribution . as",
    "a photoacoustic image is the product of the optical absorption coefficient distribution , which carries information about the tissue constituents , and the optical fluence , which only acts to distort that information , the challenge in quantitative photoacoustic imaging is to remove the effect of the light fluence .",
    "a common approach is to use a model of the unknown fluence and use it to extract the desired optical properties from the measured data .",
    "this has been done analytically @xcite or numerically @xcite , often within a minimisation framework @xcite .",
    "the majority of this literature uses the diffusion approximation to the radiative transfer equation to model the light distribution , which is accurate in highly scattering media and away from boundaries or sources @xcite . in pat ,",
    "the region of interest often lies close to the tissue surface where the diffusion approximation is not accurate .",
    "the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) , on the other hand , is widely considered to be an accurate model of light transport so long as coherent effects are negligible , which is the case here .",
    "finite element discretisations of the rte have been developed @xcite and proposed for quantitative pat reconstructions @xcite , but due to the need to discretise in angle as well as space they quickly become computationally intensive and their applicability is limited to small and medium scale problems .",
    "an alternative is monte carlo ( mc ) modelling @xcite , which is a stochastic technique for modelling light transport that converges to the solution to the rte .",
    "the significant advantage of the mc approach is that it is highly parallelisable so scales well to the large - scale inversions that will be encountered in practice .",
    "monte carlo models of light transport are popular in biomedical optics and have predominantly been applied in the planning of experimental measurements @xcite and in dosimetric studies for a range of light based therapies @xcite .",
    "many of the applications are summarised by zhu et al .",
    "one early mc model of light transport , mcml @xcite , computes the fluence in 3d slab geometry .",
    "this model was later extended to simulate spherical inclusions in the tissue@xcite , and later to spheroidal and cylindrical @xcite inclusions .",
    "mc modelling in 3d heterogeneous media has been shown both for voxelised media @xcite , which was later gpu - accelerated @xcite , and using a mesh - based geometry @xcite . although the rte is an equation for the radiance , which is a function of angle at every point , the quantity usually calculated by mc models is the fluence rate , which is the radiance integrated over all angles .",
    "the reasons are practical : most measurable quantities are related to the fluence rate rather than the radiance , storing just the integrated quantity saves on computational memory , and the estimates for the fluence rate will converge sooner than the underlying estimates for the radiance . in photoacoustics ,",
    "the measurable signal is related to the fluence ( the time - integrated fluence rate ) so current mc models can be used in the simulation of photoacoustic signals . however , as will be discussed in section 4 , the full angle - dependent radiance is required when tackling the inverse problem of estimating the optical coefficients , specifically the optical scattering",

    "the principle difference is that the light sources @xmath49 typically used in pat are restricted to the boundary , but the adjoint source @xmath48 will not be , as a consequence of the fact that the ` data ' in qpat - the photoacoustic images - is volumetric .",

    "second , the termination condition in was relaxed due to the much slower convergence of the scattering coefficient , and instead required a relative change in the error functional of 10 ^ -5^. this was satisfied after 35 iterations , and is shown in fig .",

    "however , the discrepancy in @xmath13 in the inclusion , evident from fig .",
    "[ recon - mus](d ) , suggests premature termination of the optimisation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gradient with respect to scattering is small and prone to noise in the functional gradients .",
    "this low snr in the gradients has the impact that that search directions in the optimisation routine are often sub - optimal , which results in little or no progress of the optimisation .",
    "the progressive reduction in snr in the gradient means that non - descent steps are likely and can therefore trigger the termination condition .",
    "in this paper a novel mc model of the rte was presented .",
    "the model computes the radiance in a fourier basis in 2d and is straightforward to extend to 3d using a spherical harmonics basis .",
    "the accuracy of the model was demonstrated by comparing the angle - resolved radiance at two positions in the domain to corresponding appropriate analytic solutions .",
    "sections [ sec : gradients ] and [ sec : examples ] presented the application of the rmc algorithm to estimating the absorption and scattering coefficients from simulated pat images . in section [ sec : mua - recon ] it was observed that the absorption coefficient was estimated with an average error of 0.2% over the domain relative to the true value , when the scattering coefficient is known , and in the presence of 0.7% average noise in the data .",
    "this is encouraging , particularly because noise is not only present in @xmath105 but in the fourier harmonics computed using the forward and adjoint rmc simulations , which is propagated to the estimates of the functional gradients .",
    "consequently the search direction in the gd algorithm will always be sub - optimal .",
    "furthermore , noise in @xmath111 , the estimate of the absorbed energy density at the @xmath112 iteration of the linesearch , will be also be propagated to the error functional , resulting in a non - smooth search trajectory for the linesearch because at every point @xmath113 , the error function will be corrupted by some different noise @xmath114 : @xmath115 . in practice",
    ", this did not preclude reconstruction of the absorption coefficient since the calculated gradients remained descent directions despite the noise .",
    "furthermore , the error functional in @xmath12 is sufficiently convex that the addition of some noise does not prevent the linsearch from yielding sufficiently large a step length to allow rapid convergence .",
    "reconstruction of the scattering coefficent correctly located the scattering perturbation in the simulated image , however the peak value in the reconstruction was lower than the true value .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the scattering coefficient is related to the absorbed energy distribution only through the optical fluence distribution .",
    "consequently , the snr in @xmath116 is typically much less than that for absorption .",
    "this causes termination of the algorithm before the peak magnitude of the parameter has been found in the search space .",

    "<S> forward and adjoint monte carlo ( mc ) models of radiance are proposed for use in model - based quantitative photoacoustic tomography . a 2d radiance mc model using a harmonic angular basis is introduced and validated against analytic solutions for the radiance in heterogeneous media . a gradient - based optimisation scheme is then used to recover 2d absorption and scattering coefficients distributions from simulated photoacoustic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the functional gradients , which are a challenge to compute efficiently using mc models , can be calculated directly from the coefficients of the harmonic angular basis used in the forward and adjoint models . </S>",
    "<S> this work establishes a framework for transport - based quantitative photoacoustic tomography that can fully exploit emerging highly parallel computing architectures . </S>"
