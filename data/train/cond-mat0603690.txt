    "recently much attention has focused on phase behavior of single component systems comprised of particles interacting via core - softened potentials @xcite .",
    "core - softened potentials exhibit a repulsive hard core plus a softening region , which can be a linear or nonlinear repulsive ramp , a shoulder , a double ( or multiple ) attractive well , or combinations of all these features .",
    "these models were created with the purpose of constructing a simple two - body isotropic potential capable of describing some aspects of the anomalous behavior of complex fluids @xcite , like maximum in density as a function of temperature , increasing isothermal compressibility upon cooling , and increasing molecular diffusivity with the increase of pressure @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed some time ago that these anomalies might be associated with a critical point at the terminus of a liquid - liquid line , in the unstable supercooled liquid region @xcite .",
    "the study of core - softened potentials generates models that are computationally ( sometimes even analytically ) tractable and that may retain some qualitative features of network forming fluids such as water .",
    "hemmer and stell @xcite , using the method of takahashi @xcite proposed the possibility of a second critical point in addition to the normal liquid - gas critical point , for a one - dimensional system whose pairwise potential possesses a region of negative curvature with respect to separation distance in its repulsive core .",
    "debenedetti et al .",
    "developed thermodynamic arguments to show that this type of potential can lead to density anomaly @xcite .",
    "stillinger and stillinger @xcite showed that a pure repulsive gaussian core - softened potential produces both thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies but no indication of the second critical point at positive temperatures .    a number of works investigated step potentials consisting of a hard core , a square repulsive shoulder and an attractive square well @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "such potentials have density and diffusion anomalies , a negatively sloped freezing line and possibly a second critical point in a deeply supercooled state inaccessible by simulations . in three dimensions , these potentials do not have dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies but possess a second @xcite and sometimes a third @xcite critical point , accessible by simulations in the region predicted by the hypernetted chain integral equation @xcite .",
    "jagla proposed a different version of the core - softened potential , the main element of which is a linear repulsive ramp @xcite .",
    "these potentials show a region of density anomaly in the pressure - temperature plane and also display a liquid - liquid critical point , which can be located in a stable or metastable fluid region , depending on the choice of parameters @xcite .",
    "the rogers - young @xcite approximation , together with the mode coupling theory , reproduces these features analytically @xcite .",
    "an attractive ramp @xcite displays a normal gas - liquid critical point and also brings this second critical point into an accessible region of higher temperature .",
    "an interesting issue , besides the thermodynamic anomalies , is the investigation of the dynamic anomalies , such as those exhibited by water .",
    "the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath3 for a spherical particle solute of radius @xmath4 in a medium of shear viscosity @xmath5 , is predicted by the stokes - einstein relation to be @xmath6 the rotational autocorrelation time is predicted by the debye - stokes - einstein relation to be @xmath7    simulations of supercooled spc / e water at constant temperature show that @xmath3 increases as pressure @xmath8 decreases , reaches a maximum at a density @xmath9 and decreases until @xmath3 reaches a minimum at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "further @xmath11 , has a minimum at @xmath9 and a maximum at @xmath10 @xcite , and the product @xmath12 is almost constant with density and temperature @xcite .",
    "this constancy is still an open issue and needs to be resolved .    combining eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , we see that the product @xmath12 is constant , which could explain the constancy of the product @xmath12 observed the spc / e water",
    ". however , the hydrodynamic approximations used in both the stokes - einstein and the debye - stokes - einstein relations are valid only if the size ratio between the solute and the solvent is large @xcite .",
    "this is not the case of the self diffusion of spc / e water where the tracer particle has the same size as the other particles in the system , so hydrodynamic arguments can not explain the constancy of @xmath12 observed in water @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a number of supercooled liquids , experimental results show that there is a breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation close to the glass transition temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the translational diffusion close to @xmath13 behaves as @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xcite . in this case , the product @xmath16 is not constant , but increases as the system is cooled @xcite .",
    "since water differs from other supercooled liquids by the presence of thermodynamic anomalies , the study of the relation between the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies in water might shed some light on this problem . for spc / e water",
    ", the region in the @xmath17 phase diagram where water has diffusivity anomalies defines a broad region , and the region where density anomalies can be found lies entirely inside the anomalous diffusivity region @xcite . for spc / e water",
    ", the product @xmath12 is approximately constant inside the entire region of the diffusivity anomaly .",
    "the goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that the constancy of @xmath12 is the consequence of the diffusivity anomaly . to achieve this goal",
    "we construct a simple model which has the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of water but also has rotational degrees of freedom , so that @xmath11 can be investigated .",
    "we based our model on the jagla repulsive ramp model which has the entire spectrum of water anomalies  @xcite , including the correlation between the translational and orientation order parameters @xcite . in order to create rotational degrees of freedom",
    ", we linked two ramp particles into a `` dumbbell '' by a permanent bond equal in length to the hard core diameter .",
    "thus , in our model the two monomers of the dumbbell touch each other with their hard - cores as in rombohedral crystal obtained in @xcite near the high pressure boarder of the diffusivity anomaly region .",
    "we keep the same choice of the ratio of the soft - core to the hard - core as in  @xcite , since these ratio reproduces also the water - like correlation of the translational and orientational order maps @xcite .",
    "since hard - core models can not be easily treated with a continuous molecular dynamics , we discretized the ramp by a step - function consisting of many small steps and use the discrete molecular dynamic ( dmd ) algorithm as in  @xcite .",
    "first , we test whether the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies are preserved for dumbbells and how their region in the @xmath17 diagram is alternated comparatively to the original monomeric particles .",
    "since it  @xcite it was shown that the dynamic properties depend significantly on the step of the discretized potential , we test if our conclusions are not an artifact of the discretization . finally , in the density anomaly region , we can test if the product @xmath12 is constant ( as in water ) or if it resembles the behavior of other supercooled liquids .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the dumbbell model and give details about the simulations in sec .",
    "we present the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior in sec .",
    "iii , and our conclusions in sec .",
    "the model we study is defined as follows .",
    "we consider a set of diatomic molecules formed by two spherical atoms of diameter @xmath18 linked together .",
    "the atoms in each molecule are separated from each other by a distance @xmath19 which is allowed to fluctuate in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction potential between two atoms belonging to different dumbbell molecules separated by a distance @xmath21 is a `` ramp '' made of @xmath0 steps @xcite ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the liquid phase part of the ramp phase diagram has the following characteristics .",
    "at low @xmath8 , particles prefer to be at distances @xmath25 from each other . at high @xmath8",
    "the typical distance is @xmath18 .",
    "this implies a crossover region of @xmath8 with anomalously large isothermal compressibility @xmath26 which might give rise to an accessible liquid - liquid phase transition if an attractive part is included in this potential .",
    "the discretized , step version of the ramp potential has the advantage of being well suited for study using collision - driven molecular dynamics @xcite . as @xmath27 ,",
    "the step potential becomes a `` ramp '' similar to the potential introduced by hemmer and stell @xcite and studied by jagla @xcite .",
    "indeed , the properties become similar to a pure ramp potential if the height difference between two adjacent steps is less than @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we expect @xcite that the dynamic behavior converges to the behavior of the smooth ramp when @xmath29 as o(@xmath30 ) , therefore in a slower way than the thermodynamic properties , which converge as o(@xmath31 ) .    in order to test the influence of the discretization",
    ", we study this repulsive ramp potential with @xmath32 and @xmath33 steps and @xmath34 = 1.74 .",
    "we perform `` discrete molecular dynamics '' ( dmd ) simulations , using a collision - driven algorithm @xcite , for a system comprised of 500 dumbbell molecules ( 1000 `` atoms '' ) in a cubic box , with box edge ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the dimensionless temperature @xmath37 , density @xmath38 , pressure @xmath39 , translational diffusion coefficient @xmath40 , and mean rotational correlational time @xmath41 are given respectively by @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 the particle mass , and @xmath49 the high of the repulsive ramp .",
    "we calculate thermodynamic and dynamic properties using simulations of 160,000 time steps .",
    "we analyze the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior for dimensionless temperatures ranging from @xmath50 down to @xmath51 for @xmath32 and from @xmath52 down to @xmath53 for @xmath33 .",
    "we shall first investigate if our system of diatomic molecules exhibits a density maximum as found for a system of spherical monoatomic particles interacting through the same potential @xcite .",
    "figure 2 plots the pressure @xmath54 against density @xmath55 for fixed values of @xmath56 .",
    "we see that for all the states there is no mechanical instability , and the pressure is a monotonically increasing function of density , @xmath57 implying that no phase transition is present .",
    "the isotherms cross each other , which means that @xmath58 = 0 , which implies a density anomaly .    in order to locate the points where @xmath59 = 0 , we plot @xmath54 against @xmath56 along isochores ( fig .",
    "3a , 3b and 3c ) , fit the results to a polynomial , and calculate the minima .",
    "the line connecting these minima is the temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) line , which is the boundary of a thermodynamically anomalous region where @xmath60 and therefore an anomalous behavior of the density ( similar to water ) @xmath61 because of the maxwell relations , eq .",
    "( [ rhotp > ] ) implies anomalous behavior of the entropy , @xmath62    we can uncover the effect of increasing @xmath0 on generating the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies , comparing figs .",
    "3a and 3b .",
    "we will see that the number of steps has almost no influence on the shape and location of the tmd , consistent with the fast convergence of pressure to the linear ramp value as @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the curves for the system with @xmath33 steps are expected to be almost identical to the curves for the linear ramp @xcite .",
    "the corresponding effect of the dumbbell shape can be estimated comparing the results of dumbbells with @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the systems of 1000 monoatomic particles with @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "3c ) and @xmath33 @xcite interacting with the same potential illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) for the same state points as the dumbbell molecule system .",
    "the systems of interacting dumbbells have a slightly smaller region of density ( and entropy ) anomaly , shifted to higher pressures . in these cases , for densities above 0.182 and below 0.154 , no minima in the pressure are found .",
    "we now study the mobility associated with the repulsive ramp @xmath0-step potential for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we calculate the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath3 using the mean - square displacement averaged over different initial times , @xmath63 ^",

    "3a with 3b or fig .",
    "3c with ref .",
    "@xcite , however , is very strong .",
    "whereas in the systems where the potential was discretized in 144 steps ( fig .",
    "3b and ref .",
    "@xcite ) the diffusion anomaly line lies outside the tmd line ( exactly as in spc / e water@xcite ) , for the systems with @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "3a and 3c ) the diffusion anomaly region shrinks strongly , in such a way that it migrates to a region inside the tmd line , in contrast to the behavior of spc / e water .",
    "these results are consistent with the slow convergence of the dynamic properties of the discretized ramp potential , as @xmath29 .",
    "nevertheless , the results for @xmath33 are expected to be very similar to the results for a linear ramp .",
    "the use of dumbbell molecules , unlike spherically symmetric models , allows us to calculate the rotational degrees of freedom and to estimate of the role of anisotropy .",
    "the rotational diffusion is analyzed by calculating the orientational autocorrelation function of the vector @xmath73 defining the orientation of the dumbbell molecule , @xmath74 the orientational autocorrelation function depends on the density and temperature , and for short times we can fit @xmath75 with an exponential function @xcite : @xmath76 the orientational correlation times , @xmath11 , obtained from eq .  ( [ expontau ] ) depends on density in a roughly complementary way as the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is shown in figs .",
    "5a ( for the @xmath32 system ) and 5b ( for the @xmath33 system ) .",
    "as @xmath67 decreases , @xmath11 decreases , reaches a minimum , then increases , reaching a maximum .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed for spc / e water simulations @xcite .",
    "the density region where the rotational diffusion is anomalous roughly coincides with the region of translational diffusion anomalies , as seen in figs .",
    "3a and 3b ( dashed lines ) . here",
    "again the anomaly region depends strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "the translational and rotational diffusion for systems for the @xmath0-step repulsive ramp seem to behave in a complementary way , but in fact the product @xmath77 , as shown in fig .",
    "6a , is not density or temperature independent as in spc / e water @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath78 increases with increasing temperature ( fig .",
    "6b ) , in sharp contrast with most liquids . inside the thermodynamically anomalous region",
    "the product @xmath77 is also not a constant , and a careful examination of the very low temperature behavior ( fig .",
    "6b ) shows that the product increases upon cooling below @xmath53 , in a way similar to many other systems close to the glass transition temperature @xcite . for our systems we estimate the mode coupling temperature to be @xmath79 and using the vogel - fulcher ansatz @xmath80 we estimate @xmath81 .",
    "the glass transition temperature is between these two values .",
    "the explanation for the anomalous behavior of the product @xmath12 is that the rotation of the dumbbell in the vicinity of other dumbbells may have a different activation energy than translation .",
    "this is quite plausible from simple geometrical considerations . in order to rotate",
    ", the dumbbell must overcome a larger potential barrier than to translate .",
    "then @xmath82 , where both @xmath83 and @xmath84 should be functions of density .",
    "indeed the arrhenius plot of @xmath85 at high and moderate temperatures gives perfect straight lines with weak dependence on density ( fig .",
    "figure 7 shows that @xmath86 , which quantifies how strongly the product @xmath12 deviates from a constant , reaches its maximum close to the density corresponding to the closed packed arrangements of the rumps , below which the dumbbells may translate without overcoming any potential barrier . this density may be estimated for an arrangement of dumbbells consisting of triangular lattices of vertically placed dumbbells @xmath87 where @xmath18 is the hard core and @xmath25 is considered a soft core diameter .",
    "the linearity of the arrhenius plot breaks down close to the glass transition where @xmath88 starts to increase upon cooling as in other liquids in which this behavior is usually associated with the breakdown of the einstein - stokes caused by the growth of dynamic heterogeneities near the glass transition @xcite .",
    "we have simulated a set of dumbbell molecules interacting through a purely repulsive ramp - like potential , discretized in @xmath0 steps .",
    "we compare the cases of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the @xmath33 case has the behavior very similar to that if the linear ramp .",
    "we studied the density anomaly and anomalies in both the translational and rotational mobilities .",
    "we found that in both cases the density behaves anomalously in a certain range of pressures and temperatures .",
    "comparison with simulations of monoatomic particles interacting with the same potential @xcite shows that the thermodynamic anomalies are not very sensitive to the number of steps used in the potential , and only weakly affected by the dumbbell shape .",
    "thus the existence of a fixed link between pairs of atoms and the resulting anisotropy has only a small effect on the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the dynamic anomalies , however , are more sensitive , both to @xmath0 and to the introduction of the dumbbell shape .",
    "the translational diffusion coefficient at constant temperature has a maximum and a minimum as a function of @xmath67 , but the locus of anomalous behavior depends both on the particles shape ( monoatomic or dumbbell ) as well as on the number of steps ( a potential with 144 steps has a different range than a potential with 18 steps ) .",
    "the dumbbell shape causes the dynamically anomalous region to shrink .",
    "the decrease of @xmath0 shrinks and shifts the dynamically anomalous region to lower temperatures .",
    "the region of dynamic anomalies lies approximately inside the region of thermodynamic anomalies for the @xmath32 potential and outside for the @xmath33 potential .",
    "we expect that systems with molecules interacting with a a smooth linear ramp potential would display a behavior similar to this last one . despite of the fact that this last hierarchy of anomalous regions is similar to that found in simulations of water ,",
    "some important differences should be pointed out . for dumbbell molecules , the product of the translational diffusion constant @xmath3 and",
    "the orientational correlation time @xmath11 is not a constant , even at high temperatures , indicating that translation and rotation of dumbbells may have different activation energies .",
    "this is not the case in water in which the molecules are confined in symmetrical tetrahedral shells , so the translation and rotation are associated with switching the partners via bifurcation of the hydrogen bonds @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the behavior of the @xmath12 in the dumbbell model and other dimeric liquids , such as hydrogen peroxide . at low temperatures",
    ", the dumbbell model displays a sharp increase of @xmath12 , resembling the behavior found for liquids close to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this behavior must be investigated by analyzing the `` fastest '' rotational and translational clusters @xcite .      we thank p. kumar for helpful insights and comments on the manuscript , and the brazilian science agencies cnpq , finep and fapergs , and by the nsf chemistry program for financial support .",
