    "polars or am her systems are accreting binary systems in which material transfers from a dwarf secondary star onto a magnetic ( @xmath210200 mg ) white dwarf through roche lobe overflow . at some height above the photosphere of the white dwarf a shock forms .",
    "hard x - rays are generated in this post - shock flow ( _ c.f .",
    "_ wu 2000 for a review of the shock structure in these systems ) . cyclotron radiation is also emitted in this post - shock flow by electrons spiralling around the magnetic field lines : this radiation is emitted in the optical band .",
    "some fraction of the hard x - rays and cyclotron emission are intercepted by the photosphere of the white dwarf and are re - emitted at lower energies .",
    "soft x - rays can also be produced by dense ` blobs ' of material which impact directly into the white dwarf .",
    "as part of a programme to determine how the balance of soft and hard x - rays are affected by system parameters such as the magnetic field , we have observed a number of polars using _ xmm - newton_. these include dp leo , ww hor ( ramsay et al 2001 ) , by cam ( ramsay & cropper 2002a ) and ce gru ( ramsay & cropper 2002b ) . here , we present the results on three further polars , ev uma , rx  j100219 and rx  j100720 , all of which were discovered using _",
    "rosat_. we show their main system parameters in table [ parameters ] .",
    "these systems show a range of parameters , including the polar with the shortest orbital period ( ev uma ) , and a polar with one of the highest magnetic field strengths ( rx  j1007 - 20 ) . in this paper",
    "we first discuss their temporal properties and then their spectral properties .",
    "ev uma ( re  j1307 + 535 ) also has exhibited the highest recorded degree of polarisation in any polar ( or any astrophysical object for that matter ) when the circular polarisation varied from + 50 to 20 percent over an orbital cycle when it was in an intermediate accretion state ( hakala et al 1994 ) .",
    "the degree of polarisation was reduced when it was at higher accretion states ( presumably because of the increased dilution of the polarisation by a bright accretion stream ) and the system has a significantly different light curve ( katajainen et al 2000 ) .",
    "although this object has been relatively well observed in the optical and also the euv ( using the wide field camera on _ rosat _ , osborne et al 1994 ) no x - ray observations of this object have been published .",
    "rx j100720 was shown to show a prominent dip in the soft x - ray light curve , which was attributed to the accretion stream obscuring the emission from one of the accretion sites and also has a very high soft / hard x - ray ratio ( reinsch et al 1999 ) .",
    "very little information has been published on rx j1002  19 .",

    "we have presented _ xmm - newton _ data of three polars , which display rather different characteristics .",
    "we find that in each system we can not obtain good fits to their x - ray spectra using a single component model ",
    "they all require a shock model plus a soft blackbody component . however , all three show very different soft / hard x - ray ratios .",
    "further , their light curves show a range of features .",
    "we now go on to discuss our findings .",
    "the x - ray light curves and the hardness ratio of ev uma ( figure [ lightev ] ) suggested a different accretion region may dominate before and after the absorption dip . by examining the x - ray spectra from these phase ranges we find that there is no evidence that their spectra differ .",
    "together with the phasing of the x - ray light curves and the optical light curves (  [ evphase ] ) we suggest that there is only one dominant accretion region and the presence of negative circular polarisation for a short time in the optical data of hakala et al ( 1994 ) is due to observing the cyclotron emitting region from beneath .",
    "ev uma , rx j1002 - 19 and rx j1007 - 20 show very different @xmath3 ratios , with ev uma showing the lowest and rx j100720 the highest .",
    "indeed , rx j100720 has a ratio which is a factor of @xmath020 greater than that predicted from the ` standard ' shock model of lamb & masters ( 1979 ) and king & lasota ( 1979 ) . however , the fact that it has a high magnetic field strength ( 92 mg , reinsch et al 1999 ) , a large ` soft x - ray excess ' is consistent with the work of ramsay et al ( 1994 ) and beuermann & burwitz ( 1995 ) who showed that this ratio was correlated with magnetic field strength ; with high field systems showing high soft / hard ratios . to account for this ,",
    "the most likely solution is that dense blobs of material impact with the white dwarf directly without forming a shock ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 ) or the shock is buried sufficiently deep for the bremsstrahlung emission to be thermalized in the local photosphere of the white dwarf ( frank , king & lasota 1988 ) . the fact that we observe strong flaring activity in the light curve of rx j100720 is consistent with this view .",
    "based on the soft / hard ratio we predict that rx j1002 - 19 will have a magnetic field strength which is slightly greater than that of ev uma .",
    "if we observe the accretion region(s ) of ev uma at a high viewing angle then its soft / hard ratio is consistent with the standard shock model .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2001 ) showed that using a single temperature thermal bremsstrahlung model for the hard x - ray component rather than a stratified shock as used here , the resulting ratio @xmath4 is higher : in the case of dp leo by a factor of 2 .",
    "this should be taken into account when comparing with studies using single temperature models .",
    "we can infer the mass of the white dwarf from our model fitting assuming a mass - radius relationship for the white dwarf . using the nauenberg ( 1972 ) relationship",
    "we find that both ev uma and rx j100720 have masses of @xmath5@xmath1 . in the case of rx",
    "j100219 the mass is not very well constrained , although it is likely to be less than 1@xmath1with a best fit of 0.5@xmath1 .    using the same model for the shock region as here , ramsay ( 2000 ) fitted _ rxte _ spectra from 21 mcvs and found that their masses were biased towards higher masses than that of isolated white dwarfs .",
    "there was no significant difference between the mass of the white dwarf in mcvs and non - magnetic cvs .",
    "this is consistent with the masses reported here and also the other mcvs which have been observed using _ xmm - newton _ : ce gru ( @xmath01.0@xmath1 , ramsay & cropper 2002b ) , by cam ( 0.91.1@xmath1 , ramsay & cropper 2002a ) , dp leo ( @xmath61.3@xmath1 , ramsay et al 2001 ) and ww hor ( @xmath01.01.1@xmath1 , ramsay et al 2001 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether there is a systematic bias in the masses determined with this method using _ xmm - newton _ data .      to determine the mass transfer rate we use the standard relation , @xmath7 .",
    "the accretion luminosity , @xmath8 , is the sum of @xmath9 , the unreprocessed fraction of the cyclotron luminosity , @xmath10 , and the luminosity of any dense blobs of material which do not form a shock and emit in soft x - rays .",
    "we use the best fit masses determined from our model fits to determine the mass accretion rate for ev uma and rx j100720 ( we omit rx j100219 since there is no estimate for its distance ) .    in the case of ev uma ,",
    "the results of our spectral analysis indicate there is no evidence for blobby accretion . using the model results of woelk & beuermann ( 1996 ) and assuming a magnetic field strength of ( 30 - 40 mg ) and a mass @xmath11=1.0@xmath1 , we find @xmath12110 for a range of @xmath13=110 g @xmath14 s@xmath15 .",
    "this implies @xmath16 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "the mass transfer rate is therefore @xmath17 g s@xmath15 and hence the fraction of the white dwarf that is accreting is @xmath18 .    in the case of rx",
    "j100720 the spectral results indicate that a significant proportion of the soft x - ray luminosity is in the form of blobby accretion .",
    "we therefore include @xmath19 when determining the total luminosity .",
    "we again use the model results of woelk & beuermann ( 1996 ) to estimate @xmath10 and assume @xmath2092 mg and @xmath11=1.0@xmath1 .",
    "we find that @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 ergs s@xmath15 .",
    "this implies @xmath23 g s@xmath15 and a fractional area of @xmath24 .",
    "it is difficult to compare these mass transfer rates with previous results because of the different way authors account for the cyclotron flux and whether they include the soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , the fractional area of the white dwarf which is accreting is consistent with previous studies .",
    "absorption dips of the kind seen in ev uma and rx j100219 are caused by the accretion stream obscuring the emission sites on the white dwarf as it passes through our line of sight .",
    "for an accretion region in the upper hemisphere of the white dwarf , such a dip is inevitable if the latitude of the region , @xmath25 , is less than the binary inclination , @xmath26 . in the case of",
    "ev uma , hakala et al ( 1994 ) finds the optical polarisation data is best modelled with a high inclination ( @xmath27 ) so it is likely that this condition holds .",
    "the inclination for j100219 is currently unknown .",
    "the dip ingress and egress in ev uma is rapid : the ingress takes 2030 sec and less than 20 sec for the egress ( figure [ dip ] ) .",
    "such a rapid ingress and egress imply that the stream is highly collimated . for rx",
    "j100219 the dip structure is more complex ( figure [ dip ] ) with a shorter dip preceding the main dip which also has a sharp profile .    the dip duration ( defined as the full width half maximum of the dip profile ) is 0.057 and 0.042 cycles for ev uma and rx j100219 respectively ( where we do not include the shorter dip ) . using equation ( 14 ) of watson et al ( 1989 )",
    "we find that for the observed duration of the dips , @xmath28 and 0.13@xmath29 for ev uma and rx j100219 respectively where @xmath30 is the radius of the accretion stream and @xmath29 is the distance between the white dwarf and the source which is causing the absorption dip .",
    "( we assume the stream is in the orbital plane ) . for a stream radius of 10@xmath31 cm these radii",
    "imply @xmath32 and 7.7@xmath33 cm .    to make a very approximate estimate of the radius",
    "at which the accretion stream becomes coupled by the magnetic field , @xmath34 , we use equation ( 1b ) of mukai ( 1988 ) . if we use the best fit masses , the mass accretion rates determined in ",
    "[ transfer ] , the radius of the accretion stream , @xmath35 cm , and @xmath36=30 mg we derive @xmath37 and 3.5@xmath38 cm for ev uma and rx j100219 . although there is a great deal of uncertainty in some of the values of these parameters and the applicability of equation ( 1b ) of mukai ( 1988 ) , it does suggest that the stream which is obscuring the accretion region during the dip is located in the magnetically controlled portion of the accretion flow .",
    "we can make an estimate of the total column density of the stream by taking our best model fits then increasing the absorption until the model count rate matches the observed count rate at dip maximum for the specified energy range .",
    "we find a column density of 720@xmath39 @xmath14and @xmath40 @xmath14for ev uma and rx j100219 respectively .",
    "we can make an estimate of the number density of the stream using equation ( 6 ) of watson et al ( 1995 ) . assuming the accretion flow is in the orbital plane and using the above values of the total column density we find @xmath41=5 and 0.05 for ev uma and rx j100219 respectively , where @xmath42 is the constant number density in units of 10@xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the radius of the stream in units of 10@xmath46 cm .",
    "for comparison watson et al ( 1995 ) found @xmath47=5 for rx j1940 - 10 . taking these values at face value ,",
    "they imply that either the accretion stream in rx j100219 has a rather small radius or a low number density .",
