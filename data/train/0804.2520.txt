    "a _ rod stirring device _ , where a number of rods are moved around in a fluid , is the most natural and intuitive method of stirring .",
    "the number of rods , their shape , and the nature of their motion constitute a _ stirring protocol_. for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] shows the result of stirring with the _ figure - eight _ protocol , whereby a single rod in a closed vessel traces a lemniscate shape .",
    "the reynolds number is very small , so that the fluid ( sugar syrup ) is in the stokes regime , where inertial forces are negligible and pressure and viscous forces are in balance . because of the shape of the rod and container , three - dimensional effects are negligible .",
    "the fluid is the pale background , and a blob of black ink has been stretched by a few periods of the rod motion .",
    "the evident filamentation of the blob is characteristic of _ chaotic advection _",
    "@xcite , which greatly enhances mixing effectiveness in viscous flows .",
    "we aim to understand the features of rod stirring protocols such as those depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] , [ fig : channel_exp ] , and  [ fig : s1s2s-3 ] from topological considerations .",
    "the new topological features that we discuss can be divided in two broad categories : ( i ) the injection cusps and their role ; ( ii ) the identification of higher - pronged singularities directly in flow simulations . though both of these concepts are familiar from the topological study of surface homeomorphisms  @xcite , we interpret them here in light of practical stirring protocols .",
    "our study is a natural continuation of the original investigation by @xcite and the subsequent work of @xcite .",
    "our goal is to refine the previous approaches by looking for more detailed features of the thurston ",
    "nielsen  classification in real fluid flows .    as an illustration",
    ", we examine the topological features visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] .",
    "the two unmixed regions in the centre of the loops of the figure - eight play the role of two extra rods , called _ ghost rods _",
    "@xcite , so that we can regard this protocol as effectively involving three rods .",
    "three rods is the minimum needed to guarantee exponential stretching of material lines  @xcite , and for the figure - eight protocol the length of material lines grows by at least a factor of  @xmath0 at each period .",
    "this is the first feature that can be understood from the topology of the rod motion : it places a lower bound on the _ topological entropy _ , which is closely related to the rate of stretching of material lines in two dimensions .",
    "this aspect has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "less well studied is another crucial feature obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] : the unmixed fluid ( white ) is injected into the mixing region ( kidney - shaped darker region ) from the top part of the region , where a cusp is clearly visible .",
    "we say that the figure - eight protocol has one _ injection cusp_. in fact , for three rods the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] is typical ; for instance , a kidney - shaped mixing region is also evident in the efficient stirring protocol of @xcite .",
    "the nature of the injection of unmixed material into the central region has a profound impact on mixing rates , as was shown in recent experiments  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the rate of injection of unmixed material into the central region of a stirring device dramatically limited the efficiency of mixing .",
    "this injection took place along injection cusps as described here , hence the number of injection cusps and their positions are clearly important for mixing .",
    "the importance of injection cusps is even more apparent when dealing with _",
    "open flows_. open flows , as opposed to flows in closed vessels , involve fluid that enters and subsequently exits a mixing region .",
    "this situtation is very common in industrial settings , since it allows continuous operation without the need to empty the vessel .",
    "typical fluid particles only remain in the mixing region for a short time .",
    "figure  [ fig : channel_exp ] shows the figure - eight stirring protocols in an    open channel .",
    "the only difference between cases  ( a ) and  ( b ) is the direction of rotation of the rods . in a closed vessel , reversing the direction of rotation merely moves the injection cusp from top to bottom , but in an open flow it moves the injection cusp either facing the flow or against it . in fig .",
    "[ fig : openbf ] , the injection cusp is downstream , so the passive scalar enters the mixing region from behind .",
    "this is clear from the dye filament at the bottom , which skirts the mixing region from the right .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : openbs ] shows the opposite case , where the injection cusp is upstream . in that case",
    "the dye is drawn directly into the mixing region .",
    "clearly these two cases have radically different mixing properties , as evidenced by the different dye patterns downstream .",
    "thus , being able to predict the number and nature of injection cusps from the rod motion is of crucial importance .",
    "the qualitative details of fig .",
    "[ fig : channel_exp ] are independent of the manner in which dye is injected .",
    "the extra injection cusps visible downstream in fig .",
    "[ fig : openbf ] are an artifact of the open - flow configuration : they are images of the single injection cusp being advected downstream by the mean flow at each period .",
    "the results presented in the rest of the paper apply rigorously only to closed flows , but it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : channel_exp ] that many qualitative features carry over from closed to open flows .    in this paper",
    "we will see that the number and position of injection cusps depends on the topology of the rod motion .",
    "the number of injection cusps will depend on the number of rods ( or ghost rods ) , but for a fixed number of rods only a few configurations are possible .",
    "this is because the number of injection cusps is constrained by a topological _",
    "index formula_. @xcite studied the impact of the topology of streamlines on chaotic advection .",
    "they used the euler  poincare ",
    "hopf formula ( see section  [ sec : index ] ) to determine the allowable fixed - point structure of steady velocity fields .",
    "when the flow is time - dependent , instantaneous fixed points of the velocity field mean little for chaotic advection ( except when the time dependence is weak ) .",
    "our study addresses arbitrary time - periodic flows by studying the mapping of fluid elements ( the lagrangian map ) directly , from a topological perpective .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : tn ] we present some necessary mathematical background , in particular the idea of _ pseudo - anosov _ stirring protocols .",
    "we identify mathematical objects such as the _ unstable foliation _ in a specific fluid - dynamical example .",
    "the unstable foliation associated with a pseudo - anosov protocol is the central object of our study . in section  [ sec : index ]",
    "we use a topological index formula to enumerate the possible unstable foliations for a given number of stirring rods , and section  [ sec : trm ] is devoted to a stirring device that exhibits a _ hyperbolic _",
    "injection cusp , that is a cusp associated with the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic orbit .",
    "such a cusp is less obviously identifiable from flow visualization , but can still be inferred by examining the topological properties of the stirring protocol .",
    "finally , we summarise and discuss our work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we will translate the physical system  a stirring protocol  into objects suitable for mathematical study . as mentioned in section  [ sec : stirring ] , our focus will be on very viscous flows , where stirring and mixing is challenging , and we consider the flow to be essentially two - dimensional , as is typical of shallow or stratified flows . in these circumstances ,",
    "a periodic motion of rods leads to a periodic velocity field .",
    "( note that the rods may end up permuted amongst themselves at the end of each period . )",
    "this velocity field will induce a motion of fluid elements from their position at the beginning of a period to a new position at the end .",
    "crucially , the fluid elements do not necessarily return to the same position  if they did , this would be a very poor stirring protocol indeed !",
    "a periodic stirring protocol in a two - dimensional flow thus induces a _ homeomorphism _",
    "@xmath1 from a surface  @xmath2  to itself .",
    "a homeomorphism is an invertible continuous map whose inverse is also continuous . in our case ,  @xmath1 describes the mapping of fluid elements after one full period of stirring , obtained from solving the stokes equation , and  @xmath3 is the _ disc _ with holes ( or _ punctures _ ) in it , corresponding to rods .",
    "we treat rods as infinitesimal punctures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rodsing_point ] ) , since topologically this makes no difference . as a special case , rods that remain fixed are often called _",
    "baffles_. topologically speaking , moving rods and fixed baffles are the same : they are holes in the surface  @xmath3",
    ". however , the homeomorphism  @xmath1 acts on them differently : the moving rods can be permuted , whilst the fixed baffles remain in place . here",
    ", we shall not make a distinction between stirring rods and fixed baffles , and refer to both as stirring rods .",
    "hence , a few stirring rods may be fixed by some stirring protocols , such as the figure - eight protocol in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] which fixes two rods ( the islands , or ghost rods ) .",
    "the outer boundary of the disc is invariant under  @xmath1 , corresponding to the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "our task is to categorise all possible  @xmath1 that lead to good mixing .",
    "this requires defining both what we mean by ` categorise ' and ` good mixing . '",
    "the categorisation will be done up to isotopy , which is a way of defining the topological equivalence of homeomorphisms .",
    "two homeomorphisms  @xmath1 and  @xmath4 are _ isotopic _ if  @xmath4 can be continuously ` reached ' from @xmath1 without moving the rods .",
    "if we imagine the two - dimensional fluid as a rubber sheet , this means that the two configurations attained by the sheet after application of either  @xmath1 or  @xmath4 are the same , up to deformation of the sheet . in that case , we write  @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , topology is unconcerned by hydrodynamic details and only deals with coarse properties of the homeomorphisms .    to pursue the categorisation",
    ", we invoke the thurston ",
    "nielsen  ( tn ) classification theorem  @xcite , which describes the range of possible behaviour of a homeomorphism  @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the theorem says that @xmath1 is isotopic to a homeomorphism  @xmath6 , where  @xmath6 is either _ finite - order _ , _ reducible _ , or _",
    "pseudo - anosov_. these three cases give the _ isotopy class _ of  @xmath1 , and  @xmath6 is called the tn representative of the isotopy class .",
    "finite - order means that  @xmath6 is periodic ( that is , @xmath7 for some integer  @xmath8 ) , and this can not give good mixing since it implies nearby fluid elements will periodically come back near each other .",
    "the reducible case implies there are regions of fluid that remain invariant under  @xmath6 , which again is terrible for mixing since there are then regions that do not mix with each other . for both finite - order and reducible  @xmath6 , the actual homeomorphism  @xmath1 could in practice exhibit much more complicated properties than  @xmath6 , but this can not be inferred by the rod motion itself . in the viscous",
    "flows that we have studied , @xmath1 and @xmath6 appear to have similar properties .",
    "the third case , when @xmath6 is pseudo - anosov ( or pa ) , is both the most interesting mathematically and most relevant for mixing .",
    "in fact , we will define ` good mixing ' as @xmath6 having the pa property .",
    "mathematically , a pa homeomorphism  @xmath6 leaves invariant a transverse pair of measured singular foliations , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , for _ dilatation _ @xmath13 .",
    "( the logarithm of the dilatation is the _",
    "topological entropy_. ) here  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 are the transverse measures for their respective foliation .",
    "there are several terms that need explaining in this definition , and we will illustrate what they mean by an example .",
    "figure  [ fig : s1s2s-3 ] shows the result of a numerical simulation     in a viscous flow , corresponding to three rod interchanges for each period ( inset ) .",
    "this sequence of interchanges forces the flow to be isotopic to a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism .",
    "a material line advected for six periods reveals leaves of the unstable foliation  @xmath16 .",
    "the foliation exhibits four 1-pronged singularities around the rods , one interior 3-pronged singularity ( in the region indicated by a dot , between and just above the first and second rods ) , and a separatrix attached to the disc s outer boundary , visible as an injection cusp along from the top into the mixing region .",
    "( the position of the singularities and separatrix are approximate . )",
    "compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : sing_us ] , which shows typical leaves of the foliation in the neighbourhood of singularities . ]    of a two - dimensional viscous ( stokes ) flow .",
    "the container is circular , and the fluid is stirred with four rods , shown aligned horizontally in the centre .",
    "( the velocity field for these simulations was determined using a fast spectrally - accurate complex variable method  @xcite , and the particle advection computed with a high - order runge ",
    "kutta scheme . )",
    "the inset illustrates the motion of the stirring rods : they are successively interchanged with their neighbour , in the direction shown .",
    "this protocol is written  @xmath17 , where  @xmath18 denotes the clockwise interchange of rod  @xmath19 with rod  @xmath20 , and  @xmath21 its anticlockwise counterpart  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is the inverse operation to  @xmath18 .",
    "the subscript  @xmath19 in  @xmath22 refers to the physical position of a rod from left to right , and does not label a specific rod .",
    "the collection  @xmath22 , @xmath23 , generates the _ braid group _ on  @xmath24 strands .",
    "we apply the  @xmath22 operations , called _ braid group generators _ , in temporal order from left to right .",
    "repeated generators are written as powers , as in @xmath25 .",
    "this sequence of generators , called a _ braid word _ , defines our stirring protocol , which gives us the homeomorphism  @xmath1 after we solve the stokes equations for a viscous fluid .",
    "table  [ tab : protocols ] defines the protocols used in this paper in terms of braid group generators .",
    ".the pseudo - anosov stirring protocols used in this paper , defined in terms of braid group generators .",
    "the generator @xmath18 denotes the clockwise interchange of rod  @xmath19 with rod  @xmath20 , and  @xmath21 its anticlockwise counterpart , where  @xmath19 indicates the physical position of a rod in the sequence from left to right .",
    "the generators are read from left to right in time .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]         the number of possible distinct singularity data for a foliation increases sharply with the number of rods  @xmath24 , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfol ] ( solid line ) .",
    "a convenient expression for the number of singularity data is @xmath26 where  @xmath27 is a _ partition function _  @xcite .",
    "the partition function counts how many distinct ways positive integers can sum to  @xmath28 , with  @xmath29 defined as  @xmath30 : @xmath31 the partition function has no simple exact closed form . to find the asymptotic form of   for large  @xmath24",
    ", we can use the hardy  ramanujan asymptotic form for  @xmath27 , and replace the sum by an integral , to get @xmath32 the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfol ] shows that the aymptotic form captures the correct order of magnitude for large  @xmath24 .",
    "injection cusps are not always as plainly visible as in the cases presented thus far . however , as we will see in this section , their presence can still be inferred by examining the topological properties of the rod motion , including if necessary the motion of ghost rods .",
    "this section also helps to clarify the type of topological information that can be gleaned from the motion of rods  @xcite :    * if the motion of the rods themselves forms a pseudo - anosov braid , then the rod motion yields interesting topological information even with no knowledge of ghost rods .",
    "this is the case with all the protocols in the paper thus far ( except the figure - eight , which involves two obvious ghost rods ) .",
    "the topological information is then `` robust , '' in the sense that it does not depend on the specific hydrodynamics of the fluid . * if the motion of the rods does not imply a pseudo - anosov , such as when there is only one or two rods  @xcite , and chaotic behaviour is observed regardless , then ghost rods must be included .",
    "this means either looking for regular islands ( as in the example in this section ) or for unstable periodic orbits .",
    "however , the presence and location of such periodic structures depend on the specific hydrodynamic model ( here stokes flow for a viscous fluid ) .",
    "the protocol discussed in the present section is of the latter type .",
    "figure  [ fig : trmline ] shows a material line advected by a one - rod stirring device , where the rod follows an epitrochoidal path .",
    "the path of the rod is shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmpoinc ] , superimposed on a poincar section .",
    "we make two observations about fig .",
    "[ fig : trm ] : ( i ) the poincar section reveals a mixed phase space , consisting of a large chaotic region and several smaller regular regions , including a regular region that completely encloses the wall .",
    "( ii ) the injection cusps into the mixing region are not readily apparent , though small cusps are visible .",
    "the presence of the chaotic region can be understood by examining the motion of the physical rod and of the regular islands visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmpoinc ] .",
    "these regular islands are the ghost rods that we use to explain the topological properties of the homeomorphism  @xmath1 induced by the rod motion , as analyzed in ref .",
    "the braid formed by the rod and the ghost rods is  @xmath33 , which can be shown ( with software  @xcite , say ) to correspond to a pseudo - anosov isotopy class with a single separatrix on the boundary , as well as two interior 3-pronged singularities .",
    "the singularity data is thus  @xmath34 for  @xmath35 rods  see table  [ tab : tttypes ] .",
    "this brings us to our second observation : where is the injection cusp associated with the boundary separatrix , as predicted by the braid ?",
    "the injection cusp is there , though it is much less evident than those in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] ,  [ fig : s1s2s-3 ] , and  [ fig : morerods ] .",
    "this is because here the separatrix is associated with a hyperbolic fixed point , as opposed to parabolic in the previous cases .",
    "an injection cusp near a parabolic point on the boundary has very ` slow ' dynamics near the separatrix , meaning that fluid approaches the separatrix very slowly  @xcite .",
    "this makes the separatrices clearly visible as unmixed ` tongues ' in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig8_protocol ] ,  [ fig : s1s2s-3 ] , and  [ fig : morerods ] .",
    "in contrast , the injection into the mixing region is governed here by a period-3 hyperbolic orbit near the boundary of the central mixing region .",
    "the orbit  consisting of the iterates  @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and  @xmath38  is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmline ] .",
    "notice that the orbit itself does not enter the central mixing region , just as in the cases previously considered the parabolic fixed points at the wall remain there .",
    "however , a portion of the unstable manifold of each iterate is shown     enters the mixing region and corresponds to the location of the injection cusp . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmp3unst ] : notice how the unstable manifold of iterate  @xmath38 enters the heart of the mixing region , following the rod .",
    "this unstable manifold is the boundary separatrix predicted by the braid .",
    "thus , the way in which fluid enters the mixing region is by coming near  @xmath38 and then being dragged along its unstable manifold .",
    "the iterates  @xmath36 and  @xmath37 play no role as far as injection into the mixing region is concerned .",
    "with hindsight , we can see the unstable manifold of  @xmath38 in the wake of the rod in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmline ] . because the dynamics in their vicinity is exponential rather than algebraic , hyperbolic injection cusps can dramatically speed up the rate of mixing  @xcite in the central region .",
    "the price to pay is an unmixed region around the wall of the device .",
    "a stirring device consisting of moving rods undergoing periodic motion induces a mapping of the fluid domain to itself .",
    "this mapping can be regarded as a homeomorphism of a punctured surface to itself , where the punctures mimic the moving rods .",
    "having the rods undergo a complex braiding motion guarantees a minimal amount of topological entropy , where by complex we mean that the isotopy class associated with the braid is pseudo - anosov .",
    "the topological entropy is itself a lower bound on the rate of stretching of material lines , a quantity which is important for chaotic mixing .",
    "topological considerations also predict the nature of the injection of unmixed material into the central mixing region .",
    "the number of boundary separatrices in the pseudo - anosov homeomorphism s unstable foliation determines the number of such injection cusps . the number and position of injection cusps is particularly important for open flows , such as flows in channels , since there the nature of injection has a profound impact on the shape of the downstream mixing pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : channel_exp ] ) .",
    "topological index formulas allow us to predict the possible types of unstable foliations that can occur for a fixed number of rods",
    ". we did not provide a way of deriving the topological type of the unstable foliation for a given rod stirring protocol .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by using an implementation  @xcite of the bestvina ",
    "handel algorithm  @xcite . using the enumeration presented here",
    ", a mixing device can be designed with a specific number of injection cusps into the mixing region , by allowing for enough rods and choosing the appropriate stirring protocol .    more generally , instead of physical rods we can consider periodic orbits associated with a stirring protocol .",
    "we call such periodic orbits ` ghost rods ' when they play a similar role to physical rods ( that is , material lines fold around them as if they were rods )  @xcite",
    ". the topological description presented here applies to the unstable foliation associated with periodic orbits .    in future work",
    ", we will consider not just the number of injection cusps , but their relative position as well . indeed , observe that in fig  [ fig : s1s-2s3s-4s3s-2 ] the position of the injection cusps alternates sides relative to the line of rods .",
    "this is thought to be a general feature of pseudo - anosov stirring protocols , but the proof of this requires careful consideration of whether or not given foliations are _ dynamically _ allowable , in the sense that they can be realised as the unstable foliation of a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism .",
