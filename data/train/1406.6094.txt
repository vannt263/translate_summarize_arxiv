    "tight scaling relations between the central bh mass and various properties of their host galaxies in the local universe ( velocity dispersion of the bulge component , @xmath9 , stellar masses , m@xmath10 , luminosity ) , have been discovered after the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nearly 20 years ago .",
    "these correlations @xcite have revolutionized the way we conceive the physical link between galaxy and agn evolution , suggesting a possible physical coupling between bhs and host galaxies in their evolution .    the local scaling relations , although important in establishing the role of smbhs in galaxy evolution , have been unable to uniquely determine the physical nature of the smbh - galaxy coupling .",
    "a large number of theoretical models ( some including feedback ) have been proposed which can reproduce them reasonably well @xcite , but make different predictions for their redshift evolution .",
    "constraining the high - z m@xmath7-m@xmath8 plane is thus of fundamental importance in discriminating between different models but it is unfortunately observationally complex .",
    "first of all , we have to rely on less - accurate , single - epoch virial mass estimators based on broad agn emission lines .",
    "moreover , in deriving the host galaxy properties , we are limited by the presence of the bright nucleus .    at high redshift",
    ", most studies of the m@xmath7-m@xmath10 relationship have focused on optically blue type1 broad line agn ( blagn ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) for which the uv broad lines ( e.g. mgii and civ , observed in the optical band at high - z ) are detected and virial formulas can be used to derive bh masses from the agn luminosity and the width of the broad lines ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) . the emerging picture ( see * ?",
    "* for a comprehensive picture ) points towards a mild or absent evolution of the average black - hole - to - host - galaxy - mass ratio up to z@xmath111 @xcite and a positive one for z@xmath121 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , putting together all available observations of agn at z@xmath110.1 - 7.1 that have reliable estimates of m@xmath7 , of the stellar masses of the host galaxies , and of bulge - to - disk ratios ( for low - z objects only ) , @xcite finds that the m@xmath7/m@xmath13 evolves as ( 1+z)@xmath14 , with @xmath15=0.7 - 2 .",
    "the above results , have been interpreted either as evidence that black holes form faster , at earlier epochs , than their host galaxies , or as due to an evolution of the intrinsic scatter of the m@xmath7-m@xmath10 relation ( or a combination of both effects ) . however , the sign of evolution seems to weaken at z@xmath16 when considering the total galaxy mass for galaxies that are not bulge - dominated @xcite .    according to theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the positive evolution found for unobscured bright agn at high redshift , can be interpreted as the fact that galaxy mergers , the driving mechanism for feeding bhs in bright qsos , are more common at higher redshift , and are thus able to increase the bh accretion rate more rapidly than the star - formation rate at such redshifts . on the contrary , at lower redshift ( z@xmath171 ) , for moderate - luminous , seyfert - like objects with lower bh masses living in spiral - galaxy , secular galaxy evolution , occurring mostly in galaxy disks , would increase the stellar masses , with black hole accretion proceeding at a lower rate . a radical alternative for explaining the m@xmath7-m@xmath18 relation emerges from the statistics of mass averaging in galaxy mergers .",
    "this idea , first proposed by @xcite , has been elaborated using more realistic semi - analytic models of galaxy formation properly embedded in @xmath19cdm merger trees by @xcite . according to these simulations , the creation of the scaling relations",
    "can be fully explained by the hierarchical assembly of bh and stellar mass through galaxy merging , from an initially uncorrelated distribution of bh and stellar masses in the early universe .",
    "in contrast to the observational results mentioned above , @xcite found that for agn hosted in submm selected galaxies ( smgs ) at 2@xmath202.6 , the growth of smbhs actually lags that of the host stellar mass .",
    "the apparently contradictory behavior can be interpreted as a selection bias possibly affecting in the opposite way these studies .",
    "in fact , studying luminous agn we are biased towards selecting the most massive smbhs ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while a sample of smgs will be biased towards massive stellar hosts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the galaxies that are undergoing the most intense star formation at z@xmath112 also appear to be massive galaxies at this epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to possible bias in the sample selection , quasars with different properties may represent different phases in black hole and galaxy evolution .",
    "although smgs are very interesting high-@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) objects with large star - formation activities ( up to few 1000 m@xmath23yr@xmath24 ; @xcite ) , they represent the most extreme class of sources of the entire star - forming galaxy population .",
    "new important constraints in understanding the physical nature of the agn - galaxy coupling require the extension of the analysis of the bh - galaxy relation to the population of x - ray obscured , dust reddened qsos .",
    "current agn - galaxy co - evolution models predict an early dust - enshrouded phase associated with rapid bh growth triggered by galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "tidal interactions trigger both violent star formation and funneling of large amount of gas into the nuclear region which feed and obscure the accreting smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "during this phase , we expect the central source to be buried by the surrounding material and the agn to likely appear as an optically type2 agn , x - ray obscured and red ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so far , studies on this population are restricted to very few peculiar objects and the statistic is therefore not enough to draw a global picture .",
    "the observation of red qsos is in fact more challenging compared to the blue ones .",
    "measurements of bh masses for red qsos at z@xmath121 can not be derived from optical spectroscopy : the uv broad emission lines , used to estimate the bh masses through virial estimators , are not detected due to dust extinction . for these sources",

    "until recently , there have been only a handful of published works on the evolution of the scaling relations between bhs and host masses for red qsos : the above mentioned work of @xcite based on a sample of 4 qsos detected in smgs , the work from @xcite based on three hard x - ray selected , obscured , red qsos with broad h@xmath5 emission line and the most recent work from @xcite based on a 2mass+first selected sample of 13 red qsos at 0.4@xmath17z@xmath171 .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared spectra , obtained with ` sinfoni ` and ` xshooter ` observations at eso vlt , of nine dusty , red qsos at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the sources are hard x - ray detected , characterized by cold absorption ( n@xmath110@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) and show a broad h@xmath5 component in the nir spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we complement this sample with twelve additional sources taken from the literature with similar properties resulting in a total sample of 21 x - ray obscured , intermediate type ( 1.8 - 1.9 ) , dusty reddened qsos . from the broad h@xmath5 line we have computed the bh masses through the virial formula and derived eddington ratios . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , from optical / ir multi - component sed fitting we have derived the stellar mass of their host galaxies and their sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the sources in our sample are hosted in starburst and main sequence star - forming galaxies with eddington ratios @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong trend with the bh mass i.e. less massive objects are scattered below and above the local relation while the most massive ones are mainly located above it . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the evolution of these sources on the m@xmath7-m@xmath8 plane compared to a sample of optically blue type1 qsos and we find that obscured red qsos show a ratio of m@xmath7 to m@xmath8 that increases with redshift which is consistent with or slightly lower than what has been found for blue qsos .    </S>",
    "<S> these sources may represent the blow - out phase at the end of the rapid bh growth and immediately preceding the classical blue qsos typically sampled in optical surveys . </S>",
    "<S> they in fact show evidence of outflows in the ionized gas component , but their bh has already fully formed .    </S>",
