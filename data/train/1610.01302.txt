    "a bike - sharing system has two classes of basic resources : bikes and parking spaces , each of which should be available to demand of customers at any time or space . since the bikes and packing spaces are finite and the number of bikes packed in each station is always random and dynamic , the factors frequently cause an undesirable phenomenon : some stations contain more bikes but the others are seriously short of available bikes .",
    "in this situation , the dynamic unbalance of bikes distributed among the stations may have serious influence on customer satisfaction ( or quality of service ) through two specially problematic cases : a station is _ empty _ when a customer arrives at the station to rent a bike ; while a station is _ full _ when a riding - bike customer arrives at the station to return her bike , where the empty or full station is called a _",

    ", the customer satisfaction can increase if the probability of problematic stations is reduced , and so the quality of service in the bike sharing systems can be measured by means of the _ probability of problematic stations_. therefore , it is a key research of bike - sharing systems to provide effective methods or algorithms for computing the probability of problematic stations .    to compute the probability of problematic stations ,",

    "@xcite , it is necessary and valuable to provide a simplified mean - field model of the bike - sharing system in which one main purpose is to simply show how the stationary probability of problematic stations depends on some simple and crucial parameters of the bike - sharing system .",
    "it is worth noting that this mean - field method has some basic advantages through establishing some useful relations among the simple and crucial parameters , e.g. , see fricker et al .",

    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the mean - field method to be able to deal with more general block - structured bike - sharing systems in practice through binding the mean - field theory to the matrix - analytic method . to this end",
    ", we describe a large - scale bike - sharing system including operations mechanism , system parameters and model notation as follows :    * ( 1 ) the * @xmath7 * *  identical stations : * * to use the mean - field theory , we assume that the large - scale bike - sharing system contains @xmath7 identical stations ; and at the initial time @xmath9 , every station has @xmath10 bikes and @xmath11 parking places , in which @xmath12 .",
    "every station continuously operates through either renting a bike or returning a bike , and so the number of bikes in any station can be regarded as a queueing process .    * ( 2 ) adding a  finite waiting room at each station : * to decrease the probability of problematic stations when customers are sufficient , we add a finite waiting room at each station .",
    "the finite waiting room have @xmath13 waiting places , each of which is occupied by only a customer when either she can not rent a bike from the station or she can not return her bike into the station .",
    "based on this , designing  and adding the finite waiting rooms contains two purposes : ( a ) when a customer arrives at an empty station where no bike can be rented , either she enters a waiting place in order to wait for a future bike with probability @xmath14   $ ] , or she immediately leaves the bike - sharing system with probability @xmath15 .",
    "( b ) when a riding - bike customer completes her trip and enters a full station where no empty parking space is seen , either she enters a waiting place in order to wait for a future parking space with probability @xmath16   $ ] , or she directly rides her bike to another station to return the bike with probability @xmath17 . notice that the riding - bike customer must return her bike to a station , and then she can leave the bike - sharing system , because each bike is an indispensable public equipment and can not be lost .    *",
    "( 3 ) the markovian environment : * in this bike - sharing system , the arrival and travel processes are influenced ( or controlled ) by a markovian environment , which is a continuous - time irreducible positive - recurrent markov chain with an infinitesimal generator of size @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19{cccc}w_{1,1 } & w_{1,2 } & \\cdots & w_{1,m}\\\\ w_{2,1 } & w_{2,2 } & \\cdots & w_{2,m}\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ w_{m,1 } & w_{m,2 } & \\cdots & w_{m , m}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 for @xmath21 ; @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath25 for @xmath21 . at the same time , we denote by @xmath26 the stationary probability vector of the markov chain @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a column vector of ones . based on the markov chain @xmath27 , now we describe the arrival process and the travel times as follows :    * ( 3.1 ) the arrival processes : * if the markovian environment is at state @xmath31 , then the arrivals of customers at the bike - sharing system from the outside are a poisson process with arrival rate @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    *",
    "( 3.2 ) the travel times : * if the markovian environment is at state @xmath31 , then the travel time that a customer rides a bike from one station to another is exponential with travel rate @xmath34 for @xmath35 .    *",
    "( 4 ) the leaving principle : * once a customer finishes her trip and returns her bike to any station , she immediately leaves the bike - sharing system .",
    "we assume that all the random variables defined above are independent of each other .    when observing any station in the bike - sharing system , the finite waiting room and the markovian environment play a key role in queueing analysis of this station .",
    "to explain this , the queueing structure of any station in this bike - sharing system is depicted in figure 1 .        on the one hand ,",
    "the assumption of the @xmath7 identical stations is used to guarantee applicability of the mean - field theory ( that is , the multi - dimensional markov process is exchangeable ) . on the other hand , from a practical point of view ,",
    "the stations in a major city are also designed as almost the same , for example , hangzhou has 3000 stations , and each station contains about 30 bikes .    in some major cities , there are always sufficient bike - renting customers at the trips . to improve the quality of service ( or to decrease the probability of problematic stations ) , an adscititious waiting room designed at each station of a bike - sharing system is always effective and useful . to do this ,",
    "leurent @xcite first proposed such an idea of adscititious waiting rooms , and discussed the queueing process of only one isolated station by means of the @xmath3 queue .",
    "differently from leurent @xcite , this paper adds the waiting room to each station so that this leads to a bike - sharing queueing network with many stations having the finite waiting rooms , analyzes this bike - sharing queueing network in terms of the mean - field method , and compares performance measures of the bike - sharing systems with or without the finite waiting rooms through some numerical examples .",
    "\\(1 ) to our best knowledge , this paper is the first one introducing the markovian environment to the study of bike - sharing systems .",

    "in fact , the space ( or time ) inhomogeneity of customer arrivals has a larger impact on performance measures of the bike - sharing systems . to explain this impact",
    ", this paper gives a detailed discussion by virtue of some numerical examples .",
    "\\(2 ) under the markovian environment , the mean - field analysis of the bike - sharing system is different from that in fricker et al .",
    "@xcite , fricker and gast @xcite and li et al .",
