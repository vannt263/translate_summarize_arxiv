    "one of the difficult aspects of the problem of quantizing gravity is that the spacetime metric ( whether we expect it to be a fundamental dynamical variable in its own right or an emergent quantity ) will participate in the dynamics .",
    "so the arena in which our quantum dynamics takes place can not itself be a ( fixed ) spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , we often resort , in practice , to picturing some particular classical spacetime or other as our arena . for example",
    ", we talk about some quantum black hole state by referring to , say , the schwarzschild solution and assume that we can think of the quantum theory in terms of quantum fluctuations about that background .",
    "similarly , in ads / cft @xcite we often talk , loosely , about the bulk being ads or , in an example which is a sort of combination of the previous two examples , schwarzschild - ads .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to address the question : how should we picture the spacetime of a ( stationary , spherically symmetric ) black hole which is _ enclosed _ ? or , to put the question precisely :    _ to the extent that we can describe the quantum state of such a system with a classical spacetime , what should we take that classical spacetime to be ? _    to explain what we mean by ` enclosed ' here , suffice it to say for the moment ( we will elaborate on this later ) that we deem an ordinary schwarzschild black hole to be enclosed if it is placed in a ( stationary , spherical ) box , say of area @xmath0 and suitable boundary conditions are put on the wall of that box . on the other hand",
    ", we deem schwarzschild - ads to already be enclosed , by its conformal boundary , since localized perturbations reach that boundary in a finite amount of time .",
    "again , we assume suitable boundary conditions are put on the conformal boundary",
    ".     and @xmath1 are the two crossed ( full ) horizons .",
    "when interpreted as schwarzschild or schwarzschild - ads , each point represents a 2-sphere of area @xmath2 .",
    "( in the latter cases , the spacetime is , of course , also bounded by the usual @xmath3 singularities in regions ii and iv which we have omitted from the drawing . ) [ fig1 ] ]    .",
    "the outer hyperbola represents the location of the box wall / mirror while the region to the left of the inner hyperbola , which includes the future and past ( right , half-)horizons , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , is to be interpreted with caution since , as we shall argue , we expect the notion of a classical spacetime to break down in this region due to quantum gravity effects .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    should we picture such an enclosed black hole as in figure [ fig1 ] , which , in our schwarzschild - black - hole - in - a - box example , represents the region of the maximal analytic extension to the left of the hyperbola @xmath5 @xmath6[note : moot]@xmath7 , entitled ` notes ' . ] ? in the case of schwarzschild - ads ,",
    "the undashed and dashed hyperbolae represent , together , the ( disconnected ) conformal boundary of the maximal analytic extension .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    or should we picture it as in figure [ fig2 ] , which may be interpreted as the region of the exterior schwarzschild solution of mass @xmath8 with @xmath9-coordinate less than @xmath10 or the , say , right schwarzschild wedge of schwarzschild ads with mass @xmath8  with a caution that for suitable @xmath11 @xmath6[note : deltar]@xmath7 , the notion of a classical spacetime is expected to break down for @xmath12 due to quantum gravity effects ?    the first sort of picture is , i.a .",
    ", assumed in maldacena s paper @xcite on the interpretation of the ads / cft connection @xcite in the context of a schwarzschild - ads bulk . the second sort of picture is implicit e.g.  in t hooft s @xcite _ brick - wall model _ for a ( stationary , spherical ) quantum black hole in a box .",
    "( see also @xcite . )    in the present paper , we shall argue for the validity of the second sort of picture and against the first .",
    "in fact we shall argue for some conjectures which entail that , quite generally , enclosed ( stationary ) horizons , as schematically illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , are ( both classically and quantum mechanically ) unstable .",
    "( as we discuss further at the start of section [ sect : conjecture ] , these conjectures assume that the enclosure - walls / mirrors are asymptotically null as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] and that the suppressed dimensions in figure [ fig1 ] are compact . ) these conjectures apply , in particular , to enclosed static , spherically symmetric , black - hole horizons and the instability , if it holds , is therefore distinct from the long - ago - discussed @xcite instability that holds for a kerr black hole in a box due to superradiance .",
    "it is also distinct from the instability of white - hole horizons first proposed and argued for by eardley @xcite in 1974 ( see also @xcite ) ; those horizons belong to white holes which are the time - reverse of black holes formed from stellar collapse , whereas our conjectured instability arises from the presence of white - hole horizons in enclosed ( full , time - symmetric ) kruskal and related spacetimes .    our argument for these conjectures",
    "is mainly based on what happens in the simplest possible example of an enclosed horizon : namely where we interpret figure [ fig1 ] as the region of 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski space to the left of a uniformly accelerating mirror  and , we shall usually assume , to the right of another , uniformly decelerating , image mirror represented by the dashed line .",
    "we remark straight away that eternally accelerated mirrors might , of course , be regarded as physically unrealistic .",
    "but our main purpose in studying this system is not to draw any physical conclusions about actual accelerated mirrors ( although we believe it likely that such conclusions can be drawn ",
    "see endnote @xmath6[note : realmirrors]@xmath7 ) .",
    "rather it is to have a useful analogue system to the schwarzschild black hole in a box and schwarzschild - ads spacetimes depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it might also be objected that the eternal black holes that these spacetimes may describe are also unphysical idealizations .",
    "be that as it may , they play an important role in the existing literature on black hole thermodynamics @xcite and also @xcite in the theory of the ads / cft correspondence and we feel this is sufficient reason for our conjectures to be of interest .",
    "we therefore study the free massless real scalar field ( [ wave ] ) on the above flat 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime with vanishing boundary conditions on the mirror(s ) .",
    "we show that there are classical solutions which are initially smooth with finite - energy tails ",
    "namely certain initially right - moving classical solutions supported in regions iv , i and ii  which have an infinite value for the stress - energy tensor component , @xmath13 ( see below for notation ) on the null line @xmath14 .",
    "( below , because of the analogy with schwarzschild and with schwarzschild - ads , we shall call this null line the _ b horizon _ , @xmath4  see the caption to figure [ fig1 ] . ) regarding the quantum case , we point out that many of these finite initial energy solutions ( including all the ones we explicitly consider ) also have finite norm in the appropriate one - particle hilbert space ( discussed below ) and the quantum coherent states obtained by acting on the hhi vacuum ( see below ) with the quantum field smeared with the corresponding one - particle hilbert space vectors correspond to the above classical solutions and , in particular , have the same singular @xmath13 as those classical solutions , where @xmath13 is now to be interpreted as the expectation value of the appropriately renormalized stress - energy tensor in those states . here , by ` energy ' , we refer to the usual notion of energy that we would use in ( 1 + 1-dimensional ) minkowski space in the absence of any mirrors and by ` initial energy ' we mean that this is evaluated in region iv @xmath6[note : energy]@xmath7 .",
    "( later , we shall also consider an alternative , inequivalent , notion of [ initial ] energy for this 1 + 1-minkowski mirror system  see below where we introduce the notion of _ re - signed rindler energy_. )    .",
    "the origin of the infinity in @xmath13 is simple : an initially right - moving plane wave emanating from region iv will have a given fixed phase on evenly spaced null lines as illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "these will reflect off the mirror in region i and pile up just to the future of the horizon @xmath4 . to see this mathematically , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the usual time and space coordinates for our 1 + 1-dimensional minkowski space and let @xmath17 and @xmath18 so our massless scalar field equation , @xmath19 becomes @xmath20 with general solution @xmath21 a sum of right and left - going waves . assuming that both mirrors are present and are located on the two branches of the hyperbola @xmath22",
    ", our boundary condition becomes @xmath23 at @xmath22 , and @xmath24 will clearly satisfy this if and only if @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 it is to be understood here and below that in the two - mirror case we are only interested in the resulting @xmath24 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that @xmath29  i.e.  in the region between the two mirrors , while in the one - mirror case , this restriction only applies when @xmath27 is negative and @xmath28 is positive .",
    "the picture in figure [ fig3 ] then corresponds to taking @xmath30 , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xmath6[note : chiandonemirror]@xmath7 , whereupon @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath32 for @xmath36 . here , and below",
    ", we adopt the convention that when we write complex classical solutions , @xmath37 , we intend their real part .    of course",
    ", such plane - wave solutions will not have finite initial energy . to see that there are finite initial energy solutions with the same pile - up property , and , in particular",

    "( and its restriction to region iv will have half this energy . ) on the other hand , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 which is easily seen to have a stress - energy component , @xmath13 , which is singular at @xmath48  in the sense that it diverges as @xmath49  whenever @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath41 in the range @xmath51 , we have a finite initial energy solution @xmath6[note : initial]@xmath7 for which the stress - energy tensor is singular on the horizon @xmath4 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , restricting to regions iv and i , we have a finite initial energy solution consisting of an initially right - moving local solution in region iv which , after reflecting on the mirror in region i , becomes singular on the horizon , @xmath4 .",
    "( clearly there are many more finite - initial - energy solutions with the same property . )",
    "we remark that , for @xmath41 in the range @xmath52 , the total integrated energy of the reflected wave will be finite ( even though there is a singularity in @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath41 in this range , the total amount of work needed to be done on the right hand mirror is finite .",
    "also , since the stress - energy tensor at the mirror is finite , the force that needs to be exerted on the mirror to keep it on its trajectory is , at all times , finite @xmath6[note : realmirrors]@xmath7",
    "for the quantum theory , assuming two mirrors , we can regard the region between them as the wick rotation of the interior of a disk of radius 1 in a 1 + 1-dimensional flat euclidean space and we can obtain ( the time - ordered two - point function of ) a preferred quantum state  the analogue of the hartle - hawking - israel ( _ hhi _ ) state @xcite  by analytically continuing the euclidean green function for vanishing boundary conditions on the boundary of the disk .",
    "this , in turn can be obtained rather easily by mapping the interior of the disk to the upper half complex plane with a mbius transformation , from the green function on the upper half plane with vanishing boundary conditions on the real axis , and the latter is easily obtained by the method of images .",
    "the result is that the ( non - time - ordered ) two - point function , @xmath53 , which can be taken to specify the theory ( we assume for simplicity that the one - point function vanishes ; if it does nt this wo nt change our essential results ) is given by @xmath54 @xmath55+{1\\over 4\\pi}\\log[-((u_1-i\\epsilon)(v_2+i\\epsilon)+1)((v_1-i\\epsilon)(u_2+i\\epsilon)+1)]\\ ] ] ( where we take @xmath56 to be real for positive argument and to have a branch cut on the negative real axis ) .",
    "we should mention that , as always @xcite with the @xmath57 dimensional massless scalar field , what is physically meaningful is not literally this two - point function but rather its @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 derivatives , so we may change the base of the logarithms or , e.g.  replace the term @xmath62 by @xmath63 etc .  without changing anything physical .",
    "we wish to realize @xmath53 as an expectation value @xmath64 in a vacuum vector , @xmath65 , in a suitable hilbert space , of a product of quantum fields , @xmath66 , at different points . as a seemingly good way to make mathematical sense of this  loosely based on the developments in @xcite ",
    "we begin by defining the space , @xmath67 , of ( real ) classical solutions consisting of sums of _ b - solutions _ ( whose @xmath27 derivatives have smooth compactly supported restrictions to the b horizon ) of form @xmath68 and _ a - solutions _ ( whose @xmath28 derivatives have smooth compactly supported restrictions to the a horizon ) of form @xmath69 a useful remark is that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are far from being ( symplectically ) orthogonal . indeed ,",
    "because of reflection at the mirrors , each solution in @xmath71 is equally well determined by its full restriction to _ either _ horizon , although , while the restriction of its @xmath27-derivative to the b horizon will be smooth , neither the solution itself nor the restriction of its @xmath28-derivative to the a horizon will be smooth @xmath6[note : kwtechnicalities]@xmath7 .",
    "( and similarly vice versa . )    rather than working with the mathematically problematic fields at a point , @xmath66 , we work with ` symplectically smeared ' fields @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 formally related to the @xmath66 by @xmath76 where the integrals can be thought of as being , respectively , over the b and a horizons . for general @xmath77 , we ll have @xmath78 .",
    "we next seek a _ one - particle structure _ ( see @xcite and the references there to earlier papers of the present author and/or @xcite in which this notion and notation was introduced ) @xmath79 , for our space of solutions , @xmath80  that is a complex hilbert space , @xmath81 ( to be called our _ one particle hilbert space _ ) and a real linear map , @xmath82 , from @xmath80 to @xmath81 with dense range which takes the natural symplectic form on any pair , @xmath83 , of solutions in @xmath80 , defined either ( cf .",
    "our ` useful remark ' above ) by the integral @xmath84 on the b horizon or by the integral @xmath85 on the a horizon , into twice the imaginary part of the inner - product of @xmath86 and @xmath87 in @xmath81 .",
    "we will then have that the double symplectic smearing , @xmath88 , of @xmath53 with a pair of classical solutions , @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where the inner product in the first equality is in the one - particle hilbert space , while the second inner product is on the fock space over @xmath81 ; @xmath91 , @xmath92 , denotes @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the usual fock - space creation operator for the one - particle vector @xmath95 and @xmath96 its adjoint and @xmath97 is the usual fock - space vacuum vector .",
    "we may then take ( [ ghilbsmear ] ) to be a mathematically well - defined version of ( [ ghilb ] ) .",
    "as a clue towards the correct definition of @xmath98 , we compute the restriction to each of our a and b horizons of the distributional derivatives @xmath99 and @xmath100 and find , easily , from ( [ hhig ] ) that these have the universal ( cf .",

    "this is difficult to compute .",
    "however , for our 1 + 1 dimensional massless scalar field in minkowski space with our mirrors , we must have , in view of our above useful remark , both of the equalities : @xmath116 and @xmath117 it is easy to check directly , by making the substitutions @xmath118 , @xmath119 in ( [ kbka2 ] ) , that the right - hand sides of ( [ kbka1 ] ) and ( [ kbka2 ] ) are indeed equal : the integral over @xmath120 and @xmath121 in ( [ kbka2 ] ) transforms to an integral over @xmath122 and @xmath123 which is the same as that in ( [ kbka1 ] ) except that the @xmath124 in the latter is replaced by @xmath125 but this of course gives the same result in the limit .",
    "one can , alternatively , infer ( [ kbka1])/([kbka2 ] ) directly from ( [ hhig ] ) . by the way",
    ", the same integral substitution enables one easily to check that the right - hand side of ( [ kbkb ] ) remains unchanged if one replaces @xmath126 by @xmath127 and @xmath128 by @xmath129 ( and similarly for ( [ kaka ] ) ) . using this",
    ", one sees that the cauchy schwartz inequality , @xmath130 , holds and thus that our putative inner - product on @xmath81 really is an inner - product and so @xmath81 really is a hilbert space and therefore our two - point function @xmath131 satisfies the necessary positivity requirements to be the two - point function of a genuine state .",
    "( an alternative demonstration of the latter could proceed by checking that a suitable version of reflection positivity  see e.g.  @xcite and references therein  holds for our euclidean green function . )    with @xmath98 defined as in ( [ kbkb ] ) , ( [ kaka ] ) , ( [ kbka1])/([kbka2 ] ) it is straightforward to check that ( [ ghilbsmear ] ) holds .    the two - point function ( [ hhig])/([ghilb])/([ghilbsmear ] ) is well - behaved in many respects .",
    "in particular , the renormalized expectation values , @xmath132 , @xmath133 in our hhi state of the components @xmath134 and @xmath13 of the renormalized stress - energy tensor are everywhere zero ! [ the trace term , ( 4 or -4 times ) @xmath135 ( depending on one s choice of signature ) , vanishes identically classically and , since there is no trace - anomaly ( see e.g.  @xcite ) for the massless free scalar field in a ( locally ) flat spacetime , also quantum mechanically . ]",
    "in fact we have ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the two - point function in the usual minkowski vacuum state ( i.e.  in the absence of our mirrors ) .",
    "one easily sees that both of these vanish , on noticing that @xmath138 is equal to the first term of @xmath131 in ( [ hhig ] ) and therefore cancels it .",
    "the quantity @xmath139 ( which is not a component of the stress - energy tensor ) can be calculated similarly and one easily finds @xmath140 which is also smooth in the interior of the spacetime and , in particular , finite ( with value @xmath141 ) on the horizons , albeit it diverges as the mirrors are approached .",
    "however , the situation for certain non - vacuum states is less well - behaved : consider coherent states of the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a suitable classical solution .",
    "here , we intend , by a ` suitable ' solution , not only a solution belonging to @xmath67 as defined above , but also any other solution , @xmath143 which arises as @xmath144+@xmath145 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are of the form of ( [ phibdef ] ) and ( [ phiadef ] ) provided only that the right - hand sides of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , defined as in ( [ kbkb ] ) and ( [ kaka ] ) , are finite . in particular , one may check that any of our classical solutions , @xmath148  see endnote @xmath6[note : chiandonemirror]@xmath7  where @xmath149 , is suitable in this sense @xmath6[note : checksuitable]@xmath7 . for any such coherent state , it is easy to see that the expectation value of the renormalized stress - energy tensor is equal to the classical stress - energy tensor of the classical solution , @xmath148 , and the expectation value of the total renormalized ` initial ' energy on the b horizon is equal to the classical total ` initial ' energy on the b horizon @xmath6[note : easycoherent]@xmath7 .",
    "thus we conclude that ( provided , in the quantum case , we interpret ` value ' to mean ` expectation value ' and both ` initial ' energy and stress - energy tensor are assumed to be renormalized ) in both the classical and the quantum theory , there are states for which the value of the ` initial ' total energy on the b horizon is finite and the ` initial ' stress - energy tensor ( i.e.  the @xmath150 component of the stress - energy tensor ) is everywhere finite but for which the value of the ( @xmath151 component of the ) stress - energy tensor diverges as we approach the b horizon .",
    "( note that we have used the word ` initial ' here , and in the last paragraph of endnote @xmath6[note : chiandonemirror]@xmath7 , in a different sense from its usual meaning and , for this reason , have put the word between quotes .",
    "below , we return to using the word with its more usual meaning of ` at early times ' . )",
    "we expect that there will be a similar ( classical and quantum ) singularity in the stress - energy tensor for initial finite energy , initially , say , smooth , solutions for other enclosed horizons when their picture resembles figure [ fig1 ] . more precisely we expect this when the enclosure is _ asymptotically null _ and the suppressed dimensions in figure [ fig1 ] are _",
    "compact_. we shall tacitly assume throughout the rest of the paper that when we refer to a spacetime with enclosed horizons , it satisfies both of these conditions . both these conditions hold in our schwarzschild and schwarzschild - ads examples .",
    "the reason for the asymptotically null condition is that this property in the 1 + 1 minkowski with mirror(s ) model is clearly needed for the pile - up of plane waves near the horizon , @xmath4 , discussed at the beginning of section [ sect : mirrorsing ] and for the pile - up of the solutions with finite energy tails , @xmath152 , near @xmath4 .",
    "we remark ( see section [ sect : adsabsence ] ) that an example of an enclosed horizon which is not asymptotically null is provided by plain ads .",
    "the enclosure ( i.e.  conformal boundary ) in that case is timelike , rather than null .",
    "the difference is reflected in the fact that in the conformal compactification , the horizon actually reaches the conformal boundary at a corner which forms part of that boundary  in contrast to schwarzschild - ads and other cases with asymptotically null enclosures , where such a corner is missing .",
    "the reason for assuming compactness of the extra dimensions is illustrated e.g.  by the case of our 1 + 1 minkowski mirror system producted with a flat 2 torus . by fourier analysis in the extra dimensions , massless waves in this case will obviously decompose as discrete sums of ( now all - but - one massive ) waves on 1 + 1 minkowski for which , again one expects something like the pile - up in the 1 + 1 massless case and for which one of course has the same pile - up as in the 1 + 1 massless case in the toroidally symmetric sector .    , @xmath153 , @xmath154 . in the presence of both mirrors , the cauchy problem for the 1 + 1 wave equation",
    "will be well posed for data on @xmath155 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    once we go beyond our minkowski - mirror system and consider e.g.  the schwarzschild example , ( now , kruskal ) @xmath15 translations are no longer ( local ) isometries so we have to be careful what we mean by the total initial energy of a perturbation .",
    "however , we could consider solutions specified by their cauchy data on a suitable initial surface , say ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) @xmath153 , @xmath154 , in region iv and regard them as having finite energy if the integral of @xmath134 over the negative-@xmath27 half of the b horizon and of @xmath13 over the negative-@xmath28 half of the a horizon are each finite , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 now denote the affine parameter along the horizon generators ( i.e.  the usual kruskal null - coordinates ) .    alternatively",
    "( and inequivalently ) we could say that a solution s ( initial  but see next remark ) energy is finite if the restriction of the solution to region i has finite ( positive ) energy with respect to schwarzschild time ( equivalently with respect to @xmath156 on the negative-@xmath27 half of the b - horizon , missing out a , here , inessential factor of the surface gravity ) and their restriction to the left wedge has finite ( negative ) energy with respect to the same schwarzschild time - evolution  extended in the usual way to the action of the schwarzschild isometry group to all four wedge regions .",
    "so we seem to get a useful notion of energy for the schwarzschild interpretation of figure 1 ( with box walls in both region i and iii ) by defining it to be its energy with respect to schwarzschild time in region i _ minus _ its energy with respect to schwarzschild time in region iii .",
    "thanks to the minus sign , this will be positive for all solutions .",
    "we remark that because the schwarzschild isometry group maps the box walls to themselves , the schwarzschild energy is conserved ( separately ) in region i and region iii so this energy is an attribute of a solution , and need not be thought of just as an ` initial energy in region iv '",
    ". we shall call it the solution s _ re - signed schwarzschild energy_.    defining energy analogously to the latter way in our 1 + 1-dimensional minkowski system with two mirrors ( where we might call the analogous energy - notion finite _ re - signed rindler _ energy  cf .",
    "@xcite and endnote @xmath6[note : rindlerfootnote]@xmath7 ) it is easy to see that @xmath148 ( see endnote @xmath6[note : chiandonemirror]@xmath7 ) will still have finite energy in this latter sense precisely when the integral of @xmath157 over the negative-@xmath27 half of the b horizon is finite and that this will hold provided @xmath158 ( and similar statements hold of course , for the a - horizon with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath28 . )",
    "so we still get a similar stress - energy singularity result for @xmath159 .",
    "we conjecture that , quite generally , for linear scalar bose fields , as long as the suppressed dimensions in figure [ fig1 ] are compact  as is the case in schwarzschild or schwarzschild - ads or as would be the case , e.g. , for the product of our 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski mirror example with a flat 2-torus  there will be classical solutions with finite re - signed schwarzschild energy ( and its obvious counterpart in schwarzschild - ads , which we shall give the same name , and either finite re - signed rindler energy or finite initial minkowski energy in region iv in the minkowski times torus case etc . )",
    "for which the stress - energy tensor is singular on the a and b horizons @xmath6[note : characteristicversion]@xmath7 .",
    "and we expect a similar result for the electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields .",
    "we remark that in the cases , e.g. , of schwarzschild in a box or schwarzschild - ads , the finite re - signed schwarzschild energy perturbations which are , on this conjecture , responsible for the singularity in the stress - energy tensor , come , when tracked back in time , from the ( usual ) past ( schwarzschild spacelike ) spacetime singularity .",
    "but this does nt in any way detract from the significance of our results / conjectures .",
    "it is interesting to compare and contrast this conjectured stress - energy singularity result with the well - known and well - established stress - energy singularity result for the cauchy horizon of the ( non - extremal ) reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite .",
    "just as an observer crossing the cauchy horizon of reissner - nordstrm would @xcite `` see the whole history of one of the asymptotically flat regions in a finite time ''",
    "so an observer passing from region iv to region i in figure [ fig1 ] would see an infinite amount of the history of region iv in a finite amount of time @xmath6[note : history]@xmath7 , albeit this would be seen just _ after _ crossing the horizon and in reverse time - order .    in both cases , these similar facts",
    "about the classical geometry might lead one to suspect that there are , in some suitable sense , small initial perturbations for which the stress - energy tensor is singular on the horizon as we have demonstrated here in our 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski case ( and as we have now conjectured for other cases ) of enclosed horizons and as was verified in @xcite for cauchy horizons .",
    "however , we should draw attention to two significant differences : firstly , in the reissner - nordstrm cauchy - horizon case , it was shown @xcite that the renormalized quantum stress - energy tensor of a linear scalar field in the hhi state diverges as one approaches the cauchy horizon and this seemed in accordance with a general expectation that the classical stress - energy singularity goes hand - in - hand with a pathology in the relevant preferred quantum state . here , for our 1 + 1-minkowski two - mirror model",
    ", we have seen that the appropriate hhi state has a renormalized stress - energy tensor which is finite ( in fact zero ) on the relevant ( killing ) horizon .",
    "however , we saw that there are quantum coherent states for which it diverges .",
    "so , to summarize : in our 1 + 1-minkowski two - mirror system , it would seem that the singularity in the classical stress - energy tensor goes hand - in - hand with a quantum singularity , but the relevant preferred quantum state ( our hhi state ) is , itself , free from any obvious pathology .",
    "secondly , and , arguably , more troublingly , the precise nature of the ` small initial data ' which lead to a singular stress - energy tensor at the relevant horizons is different . for the cauchy horizon of reissner - nordstrm",

    ", we shall say that a stress - energy singularity result is _ gold - plated _ if it holds for smooth compactly supported data on a suitable initial surface ; in this sense , the reissner nordstrm result is gold - plated , our stress - energy singularity result / conjecture for enclosed horizons is not .",
    "partly motivated by the above comparison , we next discuss the prospects for having something similar to a gold - plated stress - energy singularity result for our 1 + 1-minkowski system with ( one or ) two mirrors",
    ". more precisely we shall ask if it is possible to have something similar to a singular stress - energy tensor on our horizons for ( small ) smooth _ compactly supported _ initial data on some suitable initial surface .",
    "( another motivation for this investigation is indicated in endnote @xmath6[note : naturalq]@xmath7 . )",
    "consider the initial surface , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , sketched in figure [ fig4 ] . while this is not quite a cauchy surface , in view of our boundary conditions on our ( here , we assume , two ) mirrors , the cauchy problem for our 1 + 1 dimensional massless scalar wave equation with our two mirrors will clearly be well posed for smooth compactly supported data on it .",
    "one can easily convince oneself that  in some fixed lorentz frame  by choosing the support of its cauchy data on this surface to be located at sufficiently large positive @xmath16 ( and consequently large negative @xmath15 ) an arbitrarily small right - going solution with data supported in a small region of this initial surface with everywhere arbitrarily small @xmath134 , can be chosen to have a @xmath13 as large as we like along some null line parallel to and just to the right of @xmath4 .",
    "and of course a similar argument can be made that such data on our initial surface supported in a small region located at large negative @xmath16 ( and therefore again large negative @xmath15 ) will give rise to a large @xmath134 near @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , and to make this more precise , let us take a ` small ' solution here to mean a solution which has a small re - signed rindler energy .",
    "then , by taking compactly supported cauchy data for a right - going solution on our above initial surface , which is arbitrarily small in this sense , and applying a sufficiently large negative boost so as to map the support to a region of our initial surface at sufficiently large positive @xmath16 , the solution determined by it will @xmath6[note : boost]@xmath7 , due to reflection on the mirror in region i , clearly have a @xmath134 as small as we like on the initial surface while having a @xmath13 as large as we like along some null line parallel to and just to the right of @xmath4 .",
    "we remark that the re - signed rindler energy of the thus boosted data will have the same ( arbitrarily small ) value as before the boost .",
    "( and , by the way , its minkowski energy after the boost  were we to prefer that as a measure of smallness  would be smaller ! )",
    "one might think that this result , involving arbitrarily large stress - energy components for arbitrarily small initial data with arbitrarily small initial stress - energy tensor components , would be a reasonable substitute for a gold - plated result .",
    "however , there is an important and somewhat subtle difficulty : ` large ' is not the same as ` singular ' , and , given such a solution , there will clearly be another lorentz frame ( where the support of the data on our initial surface has been boosted back to lie , say , around @xmath162 ) in which @xmath13 is everywhere not large . _ in the case of two mirrors _ we can , however , overcome this difficulty as follows : choose compactly supported initial data on our initial surface which is the sum of ( again arbitrarily small ) compactly supported data for a right - going solution and of ( arbitrarily small ) compactly supported data for a left - going solution . then by applying a sufficiently large negative boost to the right - going data  so as to map it to a region of our initial surface with large positive @xmath16  and a sufficiently large positive boost to the left - going data  so as to map it to a region of our initial surface with sufficiently large negative @xmath16",
    " we may clearly make @xmath13 as large as we like near @xmath4 and simultaneously make @xmath134 as large as we like near @xmath1 while @xmath134 and @xmath13 are as small as we like on our initial surface .",
    "now , no matter what lorentz frame we transform to , at least one of @xmath13 near @xmath4 and @xmath134 near @xmath1 will still clearly be large somewhere ( in fact there will be a null line on which one or other of these quantities gets even larger ) !",
    "moreoever ( i am very grateful to chris fewster who , after i showed him my argument up to this point , suggested that something along the lines which follow might hold thanks to ` interference terms ' ) near the bifurcation point  i.e.  the point where @xmath1 and @xmath4 intersect",
    " there will be a subregion of region ii where the solution with such initial data will consist of a sum of non - vanishing right - going and left - going waves and  by making our above negative and positive boosts sufficiently big  the ( now lorentz - invariant ! ) quantity @xmath163 can clearly be made as large as we like somewhere in that region ( while there is still a frame in which both @xmath134 and @xmath13 are small on our initial surface ) @xmath6[note : infinitescalar]@xmath7 !",
    "we remark that ( still in the case of two mirrors ) an obvious quantum version of this _ silver - plated _ stress - energy _ almost - singularity _ result will go through along similar lines to the quantum version of our result on the singularity in the classical stress - energy tensor for incoming waves with suitable finite - energy tails as explained in section [ sect : quantumversion ] .",
    "we feel that , taken together , all these results are a reasonable substitute for a gold - plated stress - energy singularity result : we might say we have , instead , a _",
    "silver - plated _ stress - energy _ almost - singularity _ result ",
    "i.e.  the existence of arbitrarily small compactly supported cauchy data on our initial surface with ( in some lorentz frame ) arbitrarily small initial values for @xmath134 and @xmath13 which lead , in every lorentz frame , to one or other of @xmath134 as large as we like somewhere near @xmath1 and @xmath13 as large as we like near @xmath4 as well as to a ( lorentz - boost - invariant ) @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) as large as we like somewhere near the bifurcation point @xmath6[note : straightalternative]@xmath7 in region ii .",
    "we end this subsection we make two further remarks : first , that , in the case where there is no image mirror at the dashed hyperbola in figure [ fig1 ] , we still have our original stress - energy singularity result for incoming waves with finite energy tails and we still have arbitrarily small compactly supported cauchy data on our initial surface with ( in some lorentz frame ) arbitrarily small initial values for @xmath134 and arbitrarily large values of @xmath13 near @xmath4  but there is the objection , which we discussed above , that this is a lorentz - frame dependent result .",
    "second , as we explain in endnote @xmath6[note : realmirrors]@xmath7 we expect all the above results to be robust enough to survive when we modify the mirror trajectory ( /trajectories ) so as e.g.  to be non - inertial for only a finite ( but arbitrarily large ) interval of proper time , and also to survive , for sufficiently large flat mirrors transversal to the direction of their motion , in 1 + 3 dimensions .",
    "we conjecture that similar silver - plated stress - energy almost - singularity results will hold for other ( now 1 + 3-dimensional ) spacetimes with enclosed horizons including our 1 + 1-minkowski two - mirror model times a flat two - torus , as well as schwarzschild in a box ( with a box wall in the right wedge and an image box wall in the left wedge ) and schwarzschild - ads when pictured as in figure 1  and , in particular , that we will still have arbitrarily large ( boost - invariant / schwarzschild - isometry - invariant etc . )",
    "@xmath163 somewhere in region ii near the bifurcation ( now ) surface , where @xmath134 and @xmath13 are now the @xmath150 and @xmath151 components of the now 1 + 3 dimensional stress - energy tensor for ( linear scalar , electromagnetic or linearized gravitational ) fields of interest .",
    "for schwarzschild in a box and for maximally extended schwarzschild - ads , of course we have to choose our initial surface to lie to the future of the past spacetime singularity .",
    "( e.g.  in the case of kruskal we can choose the @xmath154 branch of a hyperboloid @xmath165 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 being kruskal coordinates , where the constant is chosen so that it lies to the future of the past spacetime singularity . )",
    "as is well - known , the stress - energy singularity result for the reissner nordstrm cauchy horizon is believed to indicate the instability of that cauchy horizon , in the sense of a big change in the spacetime geometry near it , once newton s constant is switched on and matter and gravity perturbations are allowed for .",
    "presumably it becomes , instead , a curvature singularity .",
    "( see again @xcite and see also @xcite . ) in view of our original stress - energy singularity conjecture ( for initially finite energy solutions with tails ) and bolstered now by our above silver - plated stress - energy almost - singularity conjecture ( which involves arbitrarily small smooth compactly supported initial data ) we think it s reasonable to assume that , similarly , for @xmath166-dimensional models with ( asymptotically null and with compact suppressed dimensions in figure [ fig1 ] ) enclosed horizons resembling figure [ fig1 ] , at least in the case when there is an image box wall / mirror , as soon as small matter and gravity perturbations are allowed for and the coupling to gravity is switched on , there will be a big change in the spacetime geometry around our horizons @xmath1 , @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , were that not to be the case , then , for example , in our 1 + 1-minkowski two - mirror model times a flat two - torus , by einstein s equations and , for simplicity assuming the trace of the stress - energy tensor to vanish  as would be the case for a conformally coupled massless field  and considering , say , arbitrarily small initial perturbations of such a field which are toroidally symmetric , we would have , near the bifurcation surface , that ( setting @xmath167 ) the scalar curvature invariant @xmath168 would equal @xmath169 which , as we argued above , would be arbitrarily large somewhere near the bifurcation surface , in contradiction with the local flatness of the geometry there . again , in view of this and the remaining statements in our stress - energy singularity and almost - singularity conjectures , it seems reasonable to expect that the horizons become curvature singularities .",
    "it is not difficult to see that , with these same conjectures , a similar conclusion can be similarly argued for for schwarzschild in a box ( with an image box ) and for schwarzschild - ads ( say for spherically symmetric initial perturbations ) .",
    "as we saw above , in our 1 + 1 dimensional model , the singularity in the classical stress - energy tensor for incoming waves with suitable finite - energy tails is clearly present whether or not we assume the presence of an image box wall / mirror in region iii of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "however , as we already emphasized , our above silver - plated stress - energy almost - singularity result requires the presence of both mirrors .",
    "thus it is maybe less clear whether or in just what sense , say , the product of our 1 + 1-minkowski single - mirror spacetime with a 2-torus would be unstable due to initial perturbations with compact support .",
    "a similar remark would also apply to a schwarzschild black hole in a box if we model it without an image box wall in the left wedge .",
    "but of course , in schwarzschild - ads , there are mirror - like ( conformal ) boundaries in both the left and right wedges so all the above conjectures , assumptions and arguments should apply to that case .",
    "we also note that , when there is only a mirror in region i and no image mirror in region iii , the quantum theory of our 1 + 1-minkowski mirror system will be quite different from that discussed above when both mirrors are present",
    ". further work on both the classical and quantum theory of this latter one - mirror ( /one box ) case is in progress @xcite .",
    "( see also our further mention of this work at the end of section [ sect : blackhole ] . )      assuming our conjectures in sections [ sect : conjecture ] and [ sect : silverconjecture ] and our assumptions in section [ sect : instabilityargument ] hold , how should we picture a classical spherical black hole in equilibrium ( with its hawking radiation atmosphere ) in a ( stationary spherical ) box ?",
    "if , as we have argued  at least in the case there is an image box wall in region iii  the picture in figure [ fig1 ] is unstable @xmath6[note : unstable]@xmath7 , it is tempting to assume the correct picture ( at least if we demand time - reversal symmetry ",
    "see next paragraph ) is something like figure [ fig2 ] ( regions ii , iii and iv , being separated from region i by horizons which have now become curvature singularities , dropping out of the story .",
    "of course , from the standpoint of region iii , it would be regions i , ii and iv which dropped out the story etc . )",
    "as far as the quantum theory is concerned , we expect that , in a quantum field theory in curved spacetime approximation , there will be an hhi state on the region of the kruskal spacetime between the box wall and the image box wall ( assuming it to be present ) as depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "but when quantum gravity is switched on , we expect there will be arbitrarily small perturbations of this state in which expected curvatures get extremely large near the horizons . as a result",
    ", it seems reasonable to expect  and we shall assume this from now on  that in full quantum gravity there will be no counterpart to the hhi state on the full region of kruskal between the box wall and the image box wall and , instead , the state describing a spherical black hole in equilibrium in a box will have an approximate description in terms of a classical spacetime resembling figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "above we have attempted to discuss the classical and quantum situations separately but , on the above assumption , presumably there is no fully satisfactory fully classical description and the curvature singularity where the horizons bounding region i used to be is really an inadequate classical representation of a situation ( say in the region between the horizon and the inner hyperbola in figure [ fig2 ]  see endnote @xmath6[note : deltar]@xmath7 ) that really requires a quantum gravitational description and can not be described in classical terms .",
    "all in all , we end up with a picture very similar to that presupposed in the brick - wall model @xcite previously argued for by t hooft in 1985 on different grounds .    similarly , and again assuming our conjectures and assumptions to hold",
    ", we assume that ( time - reversal symmetric ) quantum schwarzschild - ads would look like figure [ fig2 ] and not ( as maldacena suggested in @xcite ) like figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "of course , another possibility , which is , however , not time - reversal - symmetric , would be to assume that a black hole in equilibrium in a box should be pictured as the union of regions i and ii only of figure [ fig1 ] ( with the usual future schwarzschild spacelike singularity in region ii ) .",
    "now ( cf .  our above remark about being able to adopt the view that our initial matter perturbations come from infinite past schwarzschild times in the exterior schwarzschild region i )",
    "we would still expect a quantum region in the stress - energy tensor all along @xmath4 .",
    "but that s ok , since this is now at the edge of our spacetime and we again suppose that what it is telling us is that , near this edge , the classical description breaks down .",
    "common sense might seem to suggest that if we were to capture a physical black hole ( formed originally by stellar collapse ) and put it in a box and let it come into equilibrium ( with its hawking radiation ) this might be what we would get .",
    "however , it is difficult to imagine that a stable equilibrium state would not be time - reversal - symmetric .",
    "whereas , on noting , e.g.  that the null boundaries of region i would now have a different nature  the right part of @xmath4 being a quantum region , while the right part of @xmath1 remaining an ordinary classical ( future ) horizon , we see that , even restricting to region i , there would be time - reversal asymmetry . while it may seem to defy common sense , we feel that it is reasonable to entertain the possibility that , as the system equilibrates , region ii fades from the picture and we are left with a picture like figure [ fig2 ] ( i.e.  the picture presupposed in the t hooft brick wall model ) . moreover , e.g.  but not only , in the schwarzschild - ads situation",
    ", if what we are interested in is the correct minkowski - signature description of the state defined by the euclidean path integral , then we would expect this to be time - reversal - symmetric and therefore ( on our conjectures ) this correct minkowski - signature description would be like figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "all this of course resonates with the long - lasting hawking - penrose debate @xcite as to whether a black hole in equilibrium in a box is the same thing as a white hole in equilibrium in a box , or not , etc .",
    "what we can infer from our conjectures is that , if hawking is right , and a black hole in a box is the same thing as a white hole in a box , then we should picture this as in figure [ fig2 ] and not as in figure [ fig1 ] ( and not as regions i and ii of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "( we remark that where we have referred to time - reversal symmetry above and in the previous paragraph , we should probably , more correctly , refer to a suitable generalization to quantum gravity of the notion of pct symmetry . of",
    "course we admit that at present there is perhaps no such clear notion except possibly in a scattering - theoretic framework . )",
    "what we have written above about the case of a schwarzschild black hole in a box is based on our stress - energy singularity and almost - singularity conjectures and the latter has , as we have seen , a stronger statement when there is also an image box in the left wedge .",
    "thus it may still seem , perhaps , to leave open the possibility that an equilibrium quantum state for a spherical black hole in a spherical box could yet have an approximate classical spacetime description resembling figure [ fig1 ] but with no box wall in the position of the dashed hyperbola .",
    "however in the recent work on the one - mirror ( /one box ) case mentioned in section [ sect : instabilityargument ] umberto lupo and i have obtained a result which tells us that there can be no equilibrium state on this latter spacetime , even in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "the details will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this result thus strengthens our above conclusion that the only viable approximate description of a black hole in equilibrium in a spherical box in terms of a classical spacetime must resemble figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the question that interests us most about all this is the following : in the quantum case , when gravity is switched off , figure [ fig1 ] does make sense and we know that the hhi state of matter @xmath6[note : bwsewell]@xmath7 , restricted to region i , is thermal ( in particular , impure ) because , in the overall ( pure ) hhi state , region i is entangled with region iii .",
    "when we now switch on gravity and also allow for matter and gravity perturbations , then , assuming our conjectures and assumptions above ( in the pct - symmetric case ) we will have to replace the figure [ fig1 ] picture by the figure [ fig2 ] picture .",
    "it seems reasonable to then expect , though , that the quantum state of matter in region i of figure [ fig2 ] will ( outside the ` brick wall ' region ) still resemble the , thermal , restriction of the original hhi state to region i of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "but now , on these assumptions , there is no ` left - wedge ' region iii for this to be entangled with ! yet , we do not wish to give up our usual assumption that the total state of a physical system is pure .",
    "so one will essentially be forced to conclude that the matter fields in region i of figure [ fig2 ] must be entangled with something else .",
    "what can that something else be ?",
    "_ the most natural answer would seem to be the gravitational field ! _ this conclusion would seem to fit perfectly with the author s earlier _ matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis _ @xcite and in particular with the _ entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium _ discussed in @xcite ( and , prior to that , in @xcite and @xcite ) .    in @xcite ( to which we must refer for all details )",
    "we argue that an understanding of quantum schwarzschild - ads along these lines would seem to go some way towards resolving the puzzle @xcite raised by arnsdorf and smolin about how maldacena holography @xcite can be reconciled with rehren s _ algebraic holography _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we remark that , while we have argued for an instability of the maximally extended schwarzschild - ads spacetime , and the resulting invalidity of the figure [ fig1 ] picture for that spacetime , we would not expect a similar instability for plain ads even though that spacetime does contain a bifurcate killing horizon ( for an appropriate choice of killing vector ) and so four regions in some ways analogous to regions i , ii , iii and iv of figure 1 .",

    "the reason this latter situation is different is because , in the latter case , the enclosure ( i.e.  conformal boundary ) is asymptotically timelike ( rather than asymptotically null as depicted in figure 1 ) .",
    "so we would not expect the sort of pile - up that we found above for right - going plane waves near the horizon @xmath4 , and we would not expect there to be finite initial energy classical waves which develop a singularity in their stress - energy tensor after reflecting off the conformal boundary .",
    "since a first version of this paper appeared , other authors @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have come to the conclusion , on seemingly quite different grounds , that , in schwarzschild - ads , the quadruple wedge picture of figure 1 should be replaced by a picture consisting of a right wedge region i similar to our figure 2 together with a left wedge region iii ( the reflection in the vertical axis of figure 2 )  but with no future or past wedges ( no regions ii and iv ) .",
    "and they also share with the present paper the conclusion that there must be a non - classically describable quantum region near the horizons of regions i and iii as we have it in our figure 2 ( and in its reflection )  understood by them in terms @xcite of ` fuzzballs ' . however , these papers appear to differ from us in considering overall pure quantum states on the union of regions i and iii which are entangled between these two regions , whereas , as we have argued three paragraphs above , we claim here that the state which corresponds to a physical asymptotically ads black hole in equilibrium is a pure state of quantum gravity on the right wedge region i alone which is entangled between matter and gravity .",

    "[ note : initial ] note that , to qualify as a small perturbation , we would also want the solution to have , aside from finite total initial energy , no singularities in the energy density at any point in the interior of region iv .",
    "this is obviously satisfied by the solutions @xmath198 . 7 .",
    "[ note : realmirrors ] while , as we pointed out in the main text , the total work done on the mirror can be finite and the force needed to keep it on its trajectory can be at all times finite , it might be objected that the singularity in @xmath13 , and also the ` silver - plated stress - energy almost singularity result ' argued for in section [ sect : silver ] , are some steps removed from being results about physically realistic mirrors .",
    "first of all , our result is in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "secondly , one might think it more physically realistic to ask about modified mirror trajectories which are initially and finally inertial and only accelerate for a finite amount of proper time . temporarily leaving aside the former issue it is easy to convince oneself that for such modified mirror trajectories , one should be able , with suitable arbitrarily small smooth and even compactly supported cauchy data , to still make @xmath13 as large as we like at spacetime events ( near where the horizon would be were the mirror motion not to be modified ) by letting the interval of proper time for which the mirror accelerates uniformly be sufficiently long .",
    "moreover by having an image mirror in the left wedge with a similarly modified trajectory , it is reasonable to expect it to be possible , by an obvious extension of the arguments in section [ sect : silver ] , to make the scalar quantity @xmath163 as large as we like at some events near where the bifurcation point would be were the mirror trajectories not to be modified .",
    "an inevitable issue which arises now is that , the longer we make these proper - time intervals , the more work we expect will have to be done at the start and/or end of the accelerated portion of the mirror trajectory ( /trajectories ) because of vacuum friction @xcite .",
    "the point is that we expect that one or other of the portions of each of the mirror trajectories which interpolate between inertial and uniformly accelerated motion , and during which the mirror - motion is non - uniformly accelerated , will be responsible for ( ever - larger ) amounts of particle creation .",
    "the created particles will be radiated off to infinity and we expect increasing amounts of ( irretrievable ) work would need to be done on the mirror to supply these radiated particles with their energy .",
    "( additional work will of course have to be done to accelerate the mirror(s ) because of its ( /their ) mass .",
    "however , this can be made as small as we like by making the mirror mass(es ) small enough . )",
    "if we now turn to 1 + 3 dimensions , it seems reasonable to assume that similar results will continue to hold for say sufficiently large , say flat , mirrors transversal to their direction of motion , and for electromagnetic , instead of scalar perturbations .",
    "+ thus , it seems reasonable to conclude that , in principle , one could bring about spacetime regions with arbitrarily large @xmath163 , and hence , in view of einstein s equations , with arbitrarily high curvature invariant , @xmath168 , by a suitable device involving mirrors which accelerate for a finite interval of their proper time and a suitable small perturbation in the electromagnetic field ( i.e.  suitable pulse of light ) , provided one expends sufficient energy to overcome the vacuum friction mentioned above .",
    "[ note : kwtechnicalities ] note also that in @xcite when definining @xmath70 and @xmath71 in generic spacetimes with bifurcate killing horizons , as explained in the _ note added in proof _ there , one inevitably gets involved with spaces of solutions which are only differentiable a certain finite number of times .",

    "this is in contrast to our ` silver - plated almost - singularity result ' of section [ sect : silverconjecture ] .",
    "[ note : boost ] to help the reader verify the various statements made in the main text around the reference to this end - note , note first that when specifying cauchy data for right - going solutions on some initial spacelike surface , we only need to specify the first piece of cauchy data  equal to the restriction of the solution to the surface  since the second piece of data ( equal , say , to the future - pointing normal derivative of the solution restricted to the surface ) is then determined by the condition that the solution be right - going ( and similarly for left - going solutions ) . if , for the purposes of discussing cauchy data for right - going solutions , we coordinatize our initial surface , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , by @xmath27 then , if we denote the first piece of cauchy data by the function @xmath161 of @xmath27 , then we mean , by a negative boost of this data , the data whose first piece is @xmath222 of @xmath27 where @xmath223 say .",

    "[ note : infinitescalar ] note that a similar argument to that we gave in the main text for an arbitrarily large ( scalar ) @xmath163 in our ` silver - plated stress - energy almost singularity result ' will easily show that our original singularity result with finite - energy tails may be strengthened to include the statement that , in the case of two mirrors , such initial data can be chosen ( by taking it to consist of a sum of suitable left - going and right - going initial data in region iv ) so that the scalar quantity @xmath163 is _ singular _ at the bifurcation point .",
    "[ note : straightalternative ] we note that , as a mildly different alternative to our ` silver - plated stress - energy almost singularity result ' we might ( cf .",

    "we also note the following more significantly different alternative to our ` silver - plated stress - energy almost singularity result ' of our main text which is based on cauchy data on constant @xmath15 lines rather than on the @xmath154 branch of the single spacelike hyperbola @xmath153 of our main text : consider a ( countably ) infinite family of equally spaced ( in @xmath15 ) constant negative-@xmath15 lines , marching towards the past , in ( the fixed lorentz frame of ) figure [ fig1 ] which each join our two mirrors and have non - empty intersections with regions iii , iv and i and consider a sequence of classical solutions , the first of which has arbitrarily small smooth compactly supported data on the intersection of the future - most of these lines with region iv consisting of the sum of a right - going solution located just to the left of @xmath4 and a left - going solution located just to the right of @xmath1 and the @xmath228th term of which consists of the sum of right - going and left - going solutions whose cauchy data are translations in @xmath15 and @xmath16 of each set of cauchy data on the first line so that each is similarly located ",
    "i.e.  the right - going data is located just to the left of @xmath4 and the left - going data is located just to the right of @xmath1  on the @xmath228th line .",
    "then it is easy to see that , by taking @xmath228 sufficiently large , the @xmath228th solution will have a @xmath13 as large as we like near @xmath4 and a @xmath134 as large as we like near @xmath1 and a @xmath163 as large as we like near the bifurcation point .",
    "this alternative ` silver - plated stress - energy almost singularity result ' has , however , the disadvantage that it will not readily generalize , from our 1 + 1-minkowski situation with two mirrors , to a conjecture about schwarzschild in a box and schwarzschild - ads since ( a ) ( kruskal etc . ) @xmath15-translations are not symmetries ( b ) in these latter spacetimes , we can only draw such constant @xmath15 lines to the future of the past singularity .",
