    "detection and precise localization of an frb requires @xmath3arcsecond angular resolution , @xmath3millisecond time resolution , and @xmath3mhz frequency resolution . in november 2015",
    ", we conducted 10  hours of fast dump ( 5  ms ) observations of the frb121102  field with the vla@xcite at 1.6  ghz , with no burst detections . in april  may 2016 , we observed for 40  hours at 3  ghz , and again detected no bursts with either our fast imaging or beam - forming pipeline ( described below ) .",
    "detections of frb121102  with the 305-m arecibo telescope@xcite suggested that vla detections might be sensitivity limited , leading us to conduct a simultaneous observing campaign where arecibo would identify a burst in the time domain and contemporaneous vla observations would precisely localize it . in practice , this proved to be unnecessary for vla detection , but it provided a wider frequency band to characterize the burst spectra .",
    "arecibo observations used the l - wide receiver , which provides a frequency range of @xmath44  ghz .",
    "the puppi pulsar backend recorded full stokes polarization information , with time and frequency resolutions of 10.24  @xmath0s and 1.5625  mhz , respectively .",
    "each frequency channel was coherently dedispersed to 557  @xmath6 , thereby eliminating intra - channel dispersion smearing .",
    "the vla fast - sampled interferometric data were recorded with 5  ms integration time , 256 channels , and bandwidth 1024  mhz centred at 3  ghz .",
    "we first detected frb121102  on 2016 august 23 with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath335 . through 2016 september ,",
    "we continued coordinated arecibo and vla observations , detecting another 8 bursts at the same location and dm . in total , we acquired @xmath383  hrs of fast - dump interferometric observations in three sessions : 2015 november@xcite at 1.6  ghz , 2016 april - may at 3  ghz , and 2016 august - september at 3  ghz with some observing at 6  ghz .      during the coordinated campaign ,",
    "all bursts were detected with real - time analysis within hours of the data being recorded by the _",
    "_ realfast__@xcite system at the vla .",
    "the real - time processing system de - dispersed visibilities to a small range of values centred on dm = 557.0  pc  @xmath21 . for each integration and dm value ,",
    "the pipeline formed a stokes i image on time scales from 5 to 80 ms and saved images with peak s / n greater than 7.4 , a threshold based on the known false positive rate due to thermal noise .",
    "all candidates were re - analyzed offline with improved calibration , data cleaning , and refined localization using both custom , python - based software and casa .",
    "we calibrated and imaged de - dispersed visibilities with a typical sensitivity ( @xmath41 ) of 5  mjy in 5  ms .",
    "extended data table  1 lists burst properties , and the brightest detection is shown in figure  1 . by fitting a model of the synthesized beam to an image of the burst , we measure burst locations with statistical errors better than 0.3@xmath4 . however , the locations are affected by systematic errors at the level of about 1% of the synthesized beam sizes , a modest effect that is evident when comparing the localizations of the first four vla burst detections ( beam sizes @xmath32.5@xmath4@xmath17 2@xmath4 ) with the last five ( beam sizes @xmath31.3@xmath4@xmath17 0.8@xmath4 ) . using just the last five burst centroids ( with lower residual systematics due to the narrower beam ) , we find that the burst locations are consistent with the persistent radio continuum conterpart centroid ( extended data table  3 and extended data figure  1 )",
    ". the radio continuum counterpart location is measured from the error - weighted mean of the location measured in deep imaging from 1 to 26  ghz ( see below ) .",
    "the error in the offset is calculated from the quadrature sum of errors in each burst and the counterpart .",
    "beam - forming is complementary to millisecond imaging : instead of de - dispersing interferometric visibilities and searching for bursts in the image domain , the visibilities are summed with appropriate phasing to produce time - frequency data that can be searched for dispersed bursts . for the vla observations ,",
    "the calibration tables generated from time - averaged data ( see below ) were applied to the fast - dump visibility data , and custom python software and existing casa tools were used to extract time - frequency data per beam from a tiling of synthesized beams covering the search region .",
    "the time - frequency data from each beam were then written to psrfits format and run through a single pulse search pipeline that used presto pulsar processing tools .",
    "single pulse candidates from all the synthesized beams were jointly filtered to remove candidates that occurred simultaneously in many beams , as well as candidates that were narrow - band , as these were likely caused by radio frequency interference .",
    "diagnostic plots for the remaining candidates were examined by eye for bursts .",
    "the beam - forming pipeline was used to independently verify the times and positions of each of the vla detected bursts . for the example shown in figure  1 , the instrumental time resolution for the observations (",
    "5  ms ) is much larger than both the intrinsic pulse width and the intra - channel dm smearing , leading to a pixelated appearance .",
    "the 3  ghz vla fast - dump observations were also averaged down to lower time resolution , calibrated using the standard vla pipeline procedures with casa@xcite , and imaged at each epoch .",
    "once the persistent counterpart to frb121102  had been identified , we used these per - epoch images to construct the light curve of the source , as well as a deep average image of the sky ( figure  2 and extended data table  2 ) .",
    "the variability of the persistent radio counterpart is uncorrelated with the detection of bursts ; the point biserial correlation coefficient between the detection ( or not ) of a burst and the flux density of the counterpart is @xmath45 , which would be exceeded by chance @xmath375% of the time .",
    "of the 69 sources detected within a 5@xmath8  radius , nine ( including the persistent counterpart ) showed significant variability , as measured by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the source flux density and @xmath48 the image rms at epoch @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the epoch - averaged flux density .",
    "we also acquired vla imaging data covering a contiguous frequency range from 1 to 26 ghz .",
    "these observations utilized six separate receivers on the vla : l- ( 1 - 2 ghz ) ; s- ( 2 - 4 ghz ) ; c- ( 4 - 8 ghz ) ; x- ( 8 - 12 ghz ) ; ku- ( 12 - 18 ghz ) ; and k - band ( 18 - 26 ghz ) . observations were carried out on 2016 september 6 and 9 , when the vla was in the b - configuration , with maximum spacing between antennas of roughly 11 km ( on september 9 , a few antennas had been moved to their a - configuration locations ) .",
    "a third epoch was observed on september 28 , only at c - band , with the vla in the most extended a - configuration .",
    "visibilities were dumped every 2 seconds , with channels of width either 1 or 2 mhz ( depending on band ) .",
    "calibration of the flux density scale was done using an observation of 3c  48 at all bands@xcite , and the secondary calibrator j0555 + 3948 was used to monitor complex gain ( amplitude and phase ) fluctuations as a function of time throughout each of the observations .",
    "standard calibration was done with the vla calibration pipeline , and subsequent imaging done in both casa and aips .",
    "final flux densities were estimated by a number of techniques to provide a cross - check , including _",
    "imfit _ in casa , jmfit in aips , summing up clean component flux density , and summing up flux density in the image pixels .",
    "positions were measured using jmfit .",
    "the two epochs ( three for c - band ) were imaged separately , and results between the two ( three ) were found to agree to within the uncertainties ( extended data figure 2 ) , so visibility data from the two epochs ( three for c - band ) were combined together to make final images .",
    "results are reported in extended data table 3 and the measurements are plotted as part of the broad - band sed ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the european vlbi network ( evn ) observed at 1.65  ghz in five epochs ( 2016 february 2 , 1011 , 1112 and 2016 may 24 , may 25 ) for about two hours per session .",
    "the array included the 100  m effelsberg , the 76  m jodrell bank , the 32  m medicina , the 25  m onsala , the 32  m torun , the 25  m westerbork ( single dish ) , and the 305  m arecibo telescopes .",
    "the data were streamed to the evn software correlator ( sfxc ) at the joint institute for vlbi eric ( jive ) in dwingeloo , at a data rate of 1024 mbit / s ( 512 mbit / s for arecibo ) in real time .",
    "the individual station voltages were recorded simultaneously as well . during the first epoch ,",
    "the icrf source j0518 + 3306 was used as a phase - reference calibrator ( separation from the field @xmath32.9@xmath51 ) and observations were alternated between the field ( 8 minutes ) and the calibrator ( 2 minutes ) . for subsequent epochs",
    "we used j0529 + 3209 as phase - reference calibrator ( separation @xmath31.1@xmath51 ) since it was proven to be sufficiently bright ( @xmath360  mjy ) and compact for the evn from the first epoch observations .    following the vla localization of frb121102",
    ", we re - correlated all our observations with the phase center at the frb121102  position .",
    "the data were analyzed with aips following standard procedures , and the images were made with the caltech difmap package .",
    "we did not detect the persistent counterpart during the first epoch due to a combination of technical failures and the distant phase calibrator .",
    "in the subsequent epochs we detected the persistent counterpart as a slightly resolved source with typical peak brightness of about 100  @xmath0jy  beam@xmath31 and integrated flux density of about 200  @xmath0jy , and deconvolved source size of about 5 @xmath17 3  milliarcseconds at a position angle of @xmath52140@xmath51 .",
    "the naturally - weighted beam size was about 18@xmath172.2 milliarcseconds in all cases , with a major axis position angle of @xmath4254@xmath51 ; the noise was 7@xmath0jy  beam@xmath31 .",

    "a total recording bandwidth of 2  gbps with dual circular polarizations was obtained for each observation . as in the evn observations , the compact calibrator j0529 + 3209",
    "was used to provide phase referencing solutions for frb121102 .",
    "standard interferometric calibrations were applied using aips .",
    "images of the field achieved 17 and 12  @xmath0jy  beam@xmath31 rms at 1.5 and 5.0  ghz , respectively .",

    "we used 38 antennas in the c40 - 6 configuration , yielding a resolution of 0.32@xmath4@xmath17 0.13@xmath4 .",
    "calibration and imaging was provided by the alma observatory , and done using casa via the alma pipeline .",
    "the image rms noise level was 17  @xmath0jy  beam@xmath31 and did not reveal any significant sources .",
    "we used the following optical imaging data : 630-s keck @xmath60-band image from 2014 november 19 , 120-s gemini @xmath61-band image ( 2016 march 17 ) , and 1250-s gemini @xmath62-band image ( 2016 october 24 and 25 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with a combination of ` iraf ` , ` idl ` and python tools .",
    "we used the urat1 catalog@xcite as an astrometric reference frame .",
    "the astrometric errors were @xmath63  mas ( rms ) in all frames .",

    "the counterpart is not detected in near and mid - infrared observations from the ukidss@xcite and deep glimpse@xcite surveys with upper limits of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for ukidss and 17.8 and 17.3 for the glimpse 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath77 m bands . at the location of frb121102 ,",
    "the total @xmath78-band absorption , as determined from the cobe / dirbe dust maps@xcite , is 2.42mag .",
    "we use published extinction coefficients@xcite to correct for absorption in the other bands .",
    "published zeropoints and effective wavelengths@xcite and the irac instrument handbook v2.1.2 were used to obtain the flux density measurements and limits shown in the broadband spectrum of the persistent counterpart ( figure  3 ) .",
    "x - ray observations were done with _",
    "xmm - newton _ ( ids 0790180201 , 0790180501 , 0792382801 , and 0792382901 ) and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( i d 18717 ) . the cameras aboard _",
    "xmm - newton _ consist of one epic - pn@xcite and two epic - mos@xcite ccd arrays .",
    "observation used the acis - s3 detector in te mode .",
    "two _ xmm - newton _ observations occurred in 2016 february  march , before we achieved our precise localization , with pn in large window mode and the mos cameras in full frame mode .",
    "two more observations were performed in 2016 september with the pn camera in small window mode and the mos cameras in timing mode . a 40  ks _ chandra _ observation was performed in 2015 november . in",
    "the first two _ xmm - newton _ observations , the pn data were not usable for imaging frb121102  as it was positioned at the edge of a ccd chip .",
    "the mos timing mode observations are also not usable for imaging purposes .",
    "we therefore used 41  ks of pn data from 2016 september and 60  ks of mos data from 2016 february  march for x - ray imaging .",
    "we used standard tools from the xmm science analysis system ( sas ) version 14.0 , heasoft version 6.19 and caio version 4.7 to reduce the data .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ images were mosaicked together using emosaic using exposure maps from eexpmap . the number of counts in a @xmath79 and @xmath80 radius circular region , for _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , respectively , centered at the position of frb121102  were compared to several randomly selected background regions .",
    "no significant deviation from the background was found ; the 5@xmath29 count rate limits are @xmath81  counts  s@xmath31 and @xmath82  counts  s@xmath31 . to place a flux limit we assume a photoelectrically absorbed power - law spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath83 and @xmath84cm@xmath72 ( the hydrogen column density implied by the dm@xmath86 relation@xcite ) . taking into account the telescopes energy - dependent effective area and poisson statistics , we place a 5@xmath29 limit of @xmath87ergs@xmath31cm@xmath72 at 0.510  kev on an x - ray point source at the location of frb121102  using the mosaicked _ xmm - newton _ image . using the same procedure on the _ chandra _",
    "image also results in a limit of @xmath87ergs@xmath31cm@xmath72 at 0.510  kev .",
    "our observations support the conclusion that no galactic source can explain the observed dm excess .",
    "if the compact counterpart contributes the excess dm over the maximum predicted by ne2001 along this line of sight , the requirement that it be optically thin@xcite at 1.4  ghz implies a lower limit on its size ( l @xmath88  pc ) , and hence the source distance .",
    "the vlba and evn compactness limits ( @xmath11  mas in any case , ignoring scattering contributions to angular extent ) imply a minimum distance @xmath89  mpc , far beyond our galaxy .",
    "the absence of an x - ray detection constrains an agn counterpart .",
    "the fundamental plane relation@xcite between radio and x - ray luminosities and the black hole mass predicts that x - ray emission should be detected for black hole systems with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "however , not all agn follow this relationship , including radio - loud agn and systems with jet - ism interactions .",
    "radio - loud agn are likely excluded based on the low radio luminosity @xmath92 erg s@xmath31 at @xmath93 . a @xmath94 black hole , which is plausible given the @xmath95 stellar mass upper limit , would have to accrete at @xmath96 below the eddington rate to match the x - ray upper limit .",
    "our observations are also inconsistent with a young radio supernova remnant , which is typically variable on a time scale of months and associated with star formation@xcite .    for a nominal gpc distance @xmath97 corresponding to redshifts @xmath98 ,",
    "the received fluence @xmath99 from each burst implies a burst energy @xmath100 the unknown emission solid angle @xmath101 could be very small due to relativistic beaming , and together with a distance possibly much smaller than 1  gpc , could reduce the energy requirement significantly .",
    "however , the _ total _ energy emitted could be larger depending on the duration of the emission in the source frame and other model - dependent details .",
    "either way , the burst energies from frb121102  are not inconsistent with those that might be expected from the magnetosphere of a compact object@xcite .",

    "<S> the compactness of the persistent radio source ( @xmath368  pc for @xmath37 ) implies that it does not correspond to emission from an extended galaxy or a star forming region@xcite , although our brightness temperature limits do not require the emission to be coherent . </S>",
    "<S> its size and spectrum appear consistent with a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) but x - ray limits do not support this interpretation . young extragalactic supernova remnants@xcite can have brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath38  k but they typically have simple power - law spectra and exhibit stronger variability .    the burst source and persistent source have a projected separation @xmath36500  pc if @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> there are three broad interpretations of their relationship . </S>",
    "<S> first , they may be unrelated objects harboured in a host galaxy , such as a neutron star ( or other compact object ) and an agn . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the two objects may interact , e.g. , producing repeated bursts from a neutron star very close to an agn@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a third possibility is that they are a single source . </S>",
    "<S> this could involve unprecedented bursts from an agn@xcite along with persistent synchrotron radiation ; or persistent emission might comprise high - rate bursts too weak to detect individually , with bright detectable bursts forming a long tail of the amplitude distribution . in this interpretation the difficulty in establishing any periodicity in the observed bursts@xcite may result from irregular beaming from a rotating compact object or extreme spin or orbital dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the crab pulsar and some millisecond pulsars display bimodality@xcite in giant and regular pulses . </S>",
    "<S> however , they show well - defined periodicities and have steep spectra inconsistent with the spectrum of the persistent source that extends to at least 25  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> magnetars show broad spectra that extend beyond 100  ghz in a few cases but differ from the roll - off of the persistent source spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> all things considered , we can not favour any one of these interpretations . future comparison of spectra from the persistent source and from individual bursts could rule out the ` single source ' interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of the two sources and their physical relationship can be probed by detecting a burst in vlbi observations or by using interstellar scintillations , which can resolve separations less than 1 milliarcsecond .    </S>",
    "<S> if other frbs are similar to frb121102 , our discovery implies that direct subarcsecond localizations of bursts are so far the only secure way to find associations . </S>",
    "<S> the unremarkable nature of the counterparts to frb121102  suggests that efforts to identify other frb counterparts in large error boxes will be difficult , and given the lack of correlation between the variability of the persistent source and the bursts , rapid post - frb follow - up imaging in general may not be fruitful .    </S>",
