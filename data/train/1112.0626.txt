    " transversity \" in hadron physics encompasses the entire range of spin , orbital angular momentum , and transverse momentum measures of hadron structure which are accessible by experiment .",
    "@xcite as we have seen at this meeting , highly sensitive experiments such as hermes at desy  @xcite , compass  @xcite at cern , and clas at jefferson laboratory  @xcite are now providing an extensive range of experimental results which are providing new insight into the fundamental quark and gluon structure of the nucleons .",
    "the challenge for theory is to synthesize this information into a consistent picture of hadron dynamics and to confront qcd at a fundamental level .    in the case of atomic physics",
    "the structure of atoms is described by schrdinger and dirac wavefunctions . in qcd , the corresponding relativistic , frame - independent bound - state amplitudes which describe the hadron s spin and momentum structure are the @xmath2-particle light - front fock state wavefunctions @xmath3 defined at fixed light - front time @xmath4 .",
    "the constituents have light - front momentum fractions @xmath5 with @xmath6 transverse momenta @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) parton spin - projections @xmath9 .",
    "remarkably , the lfwfs @xmath10 are independent of the hadron s momentum @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and thus they are independent of the observer s lorentz frame .",
    "the lfwfs are the coefficients of the expansion of a hadron eigenstate projected on a free fock basis .",
    "the sum includes the valence fock state and higher fock states with sea quark - antiquark pairs and gluons .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath13 is conserved in the lf formalism by every qcd interaction and within every fock state , just as in atomic physics .",
    "( note that there are only @xmath14 independent orbital angular momenta for an @xmath2-parton state . )",
    "the light - front formalism thus provides a consistent , frame - independent definition of quark orbital angular momentum in hadrons .",
    "the lfwf for a hadron @xmath15 is the eigensolution of the qcd light - front hamiltonian satisfying the heisenberg matrix equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is derived directly from the qcd lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath18 give the discrete and continuum hadron spectrum .",
    "if one chooses to quantize qcd in light - cone gauge @xmath19 , the gluons have physical polarization @xmath20 and ghost states with negative norm are avoided .",
    "qcd(1 + 1 ) is solvable using matrix diagonalization for any number of colors , quark flavors and masses  @xcite , using the discretized light - front quantization method  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the lf hamiltonian methods provide a frame - independent nonperturbative method for solving qcd(3 + 1 ) in minkowski space without fermion doubling .",
    "the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of each lf fock state vanishes  @xcite . as required by the equivalence theorem of gravity  @xcite .",
    "given the frame - independent light - front wavefunctions @xmath21 , one can compute virtually all exclusive and inclusive hadron observables . see fig.[lorce ] .",
    "for example , the valence , sea - quark and gluon distributions are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath2 . form factors , exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath22 and the generalized parton distributions  @xcite , such as the distributions @xmath23 and @xmath15 measured in deeply virtual compton scattering , are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlaps of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( erbl contributions ) .",
    "the hadron s distribution amplitude @xmath26 is the integral of the valence light front wavefunction in light - cone gauge integrated over transverse momenta @xmath27 .",
    "erbl and dglap evolution are automatically satisfied .",
    "transversity observables can also be computed from the lfwfs ; however , in the case of pseudo - t - odd observables , one must include the lensing effect of final state or initial state interactions .",
    "the lfwfs are derived from creation operators acting on the light - front vacuum , which unlike the usual  instant form \" vacuum , is causally - connected , frame - independent , and trivial .",
    "normal - ordering of the vacuum is thus not needed .",
    "the lf as well as the bethe - salpeter formalism thus predict zero cosmological constant  @xcite . in the front form ,",
    "only constituents with positive @xmath28 occur .",
    "thus form factors are simple overlaps of lfwfs .",
    "in contrast , in the instant form defined at fixed time @xmath29 , one must include contributions to the current resulting from vacuum fluctuations such as the @xmath30 currents which connect to the hadron , one must also boost the equal - time wavefunctions , a complicated dynamical problem  @xcite .",
    "the five - quark fock state of the proton s lfwf @xmath31 is the primary origin of the sea quark distributions of the proton  @xcite .",
    "experiments show that the sea quarks have remarkable nonperturbative features , such as @xmath32 , an intrinsic strangeness  @xcite distribution @xmath33 appearing at @xmath34 , as well as intrinsic charm and bottom distributions at large @xmath35 .",
    "such distributions  @xcite will arise rigorously from @xmath36 insertions connected to the valence quarks in the proton self - energy ; in fact , they fit a universal intrinsic quark model  @xcite as shown by chang and peng  @xcite .",
    "a long - sought goal in hadron physics is to find a simple analytic first approximation to qcd analogous to the schrdinger - coulomb equation of atomic physics .",
    "this problem is particularly challenging since the formalism must be relativistic , color - confining , and consistent with chiral symmetry .",
    "de teramond and i  @xcite have shown that the soft - wall ads / qcd model , modified by a positive - sign dilaton metric , leads to a simple schrdinger - like light - front wave equation and a remarkable one - parameter description of nonperturbative hadron dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the model predicts a zero - mass pion for massless quarks and a regge spectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the ( leading ) orbital angular momentum @xmath37 of the hadrons and their radial quantum number @xmath38 .",
    "light - front holography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension variable @xmath39 of anti - de sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized on the light front .",
    "the resulting lorentz - invariant relativistic light - front wave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable @xmath40 which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron at equal light - front time .",
    "the result is a semi - classical frame - independent first approximation to the spectra and light - front wavefunctions of meson and baryon light - quark bound states , which in turn predicts the behavior of the pion and nucleon form factors .",
    "the theory implements chiral symmetry in a novel way : the effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as one goes toward large interquark separation , consistent with spectroscopic data , the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different orbital angular momentum ; e.g. , the proton eigenstate in ads / qcd with massless quarks has @xmath41 and @xmath42 light - front fock components with equal probability  the proton acts as a chiral dual .",
    "thus in ads / qcd the spin of the proton is carried by the quark orbital angular momentum : @xmath43 since @xmath44 helping to explain the  spin - crisis \"  @xcite     from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=680 ]    the ads / qcd soft - wall model also predicts the form of the non - perturbative effective coupling @xmath45 and its @xmath46-function  @xcite , and the ads / qcd light - front wavefunctions also lead to a method for computing the hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude level  @xcite . in general",
    "the qcd hamiltonian can be systematically reduced to an effective equation in acting on the valence fock state .",
    "this is illustrated for mesons in fig .",
    "[ hlf ] the kinetic energy contains a term @xmath47 analogous to @xmath48 in nonrelativistic theory , where the invariant @xmath49 is conjugate to the @xmath50 invariant mass @xmath51 .",
    "it plays the role of the radial variable @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the projection of the orbital angular momentum appearing in the @xmath54 basis . in qcd ,",
    "the interaction @xmath55 couples the valence state to all fock states .",
    "the ads / qcd model has the identical structure as the reduced form of the lf hamiltonian , but it also specifies the confining potential as @xmath56 this correspondence , plus the fact that one can match the ads / qcd formulae for elastic electromagnetic and gravitational form factors to the lf drell - yan west formula , is the basis for light - front holography .",
    "the light - quark meson and baryon spectroscopy is well described taking the mass parameter @xmath57 gev .",
    "the linear trajectories in @xmath58 have the same slope in @xmath37 and @xmath2 , the radial quantum number .",
    "the corresponding lf wavefunctions are functions of the off - shell invariant mass .",
    "ads / qcd , together with light - front holography  @xcite thus provides an simple lorentz - invariant color - confining approximation to qcd which is successful in accounting for light - quark meson and baryon spectroscopy as well as their lfwfs .",
    "it can be systematically improved by lippmann - schwinger methods  @xcite or using the ads / qcd orthonormal basis to diagonalize @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the imaginary part of the deeply virtual compton scattering amplitude is determined at leading twist by generalized parton distributions , but that the real part has an undetermined  @xmath60-term \" subtraction . in fact , the real part is determined by the local two - photon interactions of the quark current in the qcd light - front hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this contact interaction leads to a real energy - independent contribution to the dvcs amplitude which is independent of the photon virtuality at fixed @xmath29 .",
    "the interference of the timelike dvcs amplitude with the bethe - heitler amplitude leads to a charge asymmetry in @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "such measurements can verify that quarks carry the fundamental electromagnetic current within hadrons .",
    "the effects of final - state interactions of the scattered quark in deep inelastic scattering have been traditionally assumed to be power - law suppressed . in fact , the final - state gluonic interactions of the scattered quark lead to a @xmath0-odd non - zero spin correlation of the plane of the lepton - quark scattering plane with the polarization of the target proton  @xcite .",
    "this leading - twist bjorken - scaling  sivers effect \" is nonuniversal since qcd predicts an opposite - sign correlation  @xcite in drell - yan reactions due to the initial - state interactions of the annihilating antiquark .",
    "the same final - state interactions of the struck quark with the spectators  @xcite also lead to diffractive events in deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at leading twist , such as @xmath62 where the proton remains intact and isolated in rapidity ; in fact , approximately 10% of the deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering events observed at hera are diffractive  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system requires that the target remnant emerges in a color - singlet state ; this is made possible in any gauge by the soft rescattering incorporated in the wilson line or by augmented light - front wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the sivers single - spin asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton scattering is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sivers ] .",
    "the analysis requires two different orbital angular momentum components : @xmath63-wave with the quark - spin parallel to the proton spin and @xmath64-wave for the quark with anti - parallel spin ; the difference between the final - state ",
    "coulomb \" phases leads to the @xmath65 correlation of the proton s spin with the virtual photon - to - quark production plane .",
    "recent high precision measurements presented at transversity 2011 by the compass collaboration from @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "[ compass ] .",
    "the original model calculation by hwang , schmidt , and myself  @xcite in fact gives a good representation of the hermes and compass data . the same @xmath67 and @xmath64-wave proton wavefunctions appear in the calculation of the pauli form factor quark - by - quark .",
    "thus one can correlate the sivers asymmetry for each struck with the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton carried by that quark  @xcite , thus leading to the prediction that the sivers effect is larger for positive pions .",
    "the empirical evidence that the sivers effect is small for the deuteron suggests that gluons do not carry significant orbital angular momentum in the nucleon .",
    "one also can associate the dynamics of lensing with a wilson line for each partial wave  @xcite .",
    "the physics of the lensing dynamics involves nonperturbative quark - quark interactions at small momentum transfer , not the hard scale @xmath68 of the virtuality of the photon .",
    "it would interesting to see if these strength soft initial or final state scattering interactions can be predicted using the confining potential of ads / qcd .",
    "the nontrivial effects from rescattering and diffraction highlight the need for a fundamental understanding the dynamics of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "this is essential for understanding phenomena such as the quantum mechanics of hadron formation , the remarkable effects of initial and final interactions , the origins of diffractive phenomena and single - spin asymmetries , and manifestations of higher - twist semi - exclusive hadron subprocesses .",
    "it is natural to assume that the nuclear modifications to the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus and neutrino - nucleus interactions are identical ; in fact , gribov - glauber theory predicts that the antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal , but depends on the quantum numbers of each struck quark and antiquark  @xcite .",
    "this observation can explain the recent analysis of schienbein et al.@xcite which shows that the nutev measurements of nuclear structure functions obtain from neutrino charged current reactions differ significantly from the distributions measured in deep inelastic electron and muon scattering .",
    "as noted by collins and qiu  @xcite , the traditional factorization formalism of perturbative qcd fails in detail for many types of hard inclusive reactions because of initial- and final - state interactions .",
    "for example , if both the quark and antiquark in the drell - yan subprocess @xmath69 interact with the spectators of the other hadron , then one predicts a @xmath70 planar correlation in unpolarized drell - yan reactions  @xcite .",
    "double boer - mulders effect \" can account for the large @xmath71 correlation and the corresponding violation  @xcite of the lam - tung relation for drell - yan processes observed by the na10 collaboration",
    ". an important signal for factorization breakdown at the lhc will be the observation of a @xmath71 planar correlation in dijet production .",
    "it is thus important to distinguish  @xcite  static \" structure functions which are computed directly from the light - front wavefunctions of a target hadron from the nonuniversal ",
    "dynamic \" empirical structure functions which take into account rescattering of the struck quark in deep inelastic lepton scattering . see fig.[fignew17 ] .",
    "the real wavefunctions of hadrons which underlying the static structure functions can not describe diffractive deep inelastic scattering nor single - spin asymmetries , since such phenomena involve the complex phase structure of the @xmath72 amplitude .",
    "one can augment the light - front wavefunctions with a gauge link corresponding to an external field created by the virtual photon @xmath73 pair current  @xcite , but such a gauge link is process dependent  @xcite , so the resulting augmented wavefunctions are not universal . @xcite .",
    "the physics of rescattering and nuclear shadowing is not included in the nuclear light - front wavefunctions , and a probabilistic interpretation of the nuclear dis cross section is thus precluded .",
    "a historic example of transversity is the remarkably large spin correlation @xmath74 measured in elastic @xmath75 elastic scattering  @xcite measured by krisch and collaborators , where the beam and target are polarized normal to the scattering plane .",
    "remarkably the ratio of spin parallel to anti - parallel scattering reaches 4:1 at @xmath76 this can be explained  @xcite as due to the excitation of a @xmath77 resonance with @xmath78 in the intermediate state . a comparable effect is also seen at the @xmath79 threshold",
    "transversity observables , such as the t - odd sivers effect measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering on polarized protons , and the momentum distributions measured in deeply virtual compton scattering are now providing new constraints on the fundamental quark and gluon structure of the proton . in this",
    "talk i have discussed the challenge of computing these observables from first principles ; i.e. ; quantum chromodynamics , itself .",
    "a key step is the determination of the the frame - independent light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) of hadrons  the analogs of the schrdinger wavefunctions of atomic physics .",
    "they are the eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian evaluated at fixed light - front time and the fundamental amplitudes underlying hadron observables such as transverse momentum distributions , structure functions and distribution amplitudes .",
    "the lensing effects of initial - state and final - state interactions together with the lfwfs with different orbital angular momentum lead to @xmath0-odd transversity observables such as the sivers , collins , and boer - mulders distributions .",
    "the lensing effect also leads to leading - twist phenomena which break factorization theorems , such as the breakdown of the lam - tung relation in drell - yan reactions .",
    "a similar rescattering mechanism also leads to diffractive deep inelastic scattering , as well as nuclear shadowing and antishadowing .",
    "thus one should distinguish ",
    "static \" structure functions , the probability distributions computed from the square of the target light - front wavefunctions , versus  dynamical \" structure functions which include the effects of initial- and final - state rescattering .",
    "i have also discussed related effects such as the @xmath1 fixed pole contribution which appears in the real part of the virtual compton amplitude .",
    "remarkably , ads / qcd , together with  light - front holography \" provides an simple lorentz - invariant color - confining approximation to qcd which is successful in accounting for light - quark meson and baryon spectroscopy as well as the qcd dynamics expressible in terms of their lfwfs",

    "<S> transversity observables , such as the t - odd single - spin asymmetry measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering on polarized protons , and the distributions which are measured in deeply virtual compton scattering provide important constraints on the fundamental quark and gluon structure of the proton . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> i discuss the challenge of computing these observables from first principles ; i.e. , quantum chromodynamics , itself . </S>",
    "<S> a key step is the determination of the frame - independent light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) of hadrons  </S>",
    "<S> the qcd eigensolutions which are analogs of the schrdinger wavefunctions of atomic physics . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing effects of initial - state and final - state interactions , acting on lfwfs with different orbital angular momentum , lead to the @xmath0-odd transversity observables such as the sivers , collins , and boer - mulders distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the lensing effect also leads to leading - twist phenomena which break leading - twist factorization , such as the breakdown of the lam - tung relation in drell - yan reactions . </S>",
    "<S> a similar rescattering mechanism also leads to diffractive deep inelastic scattering , as well as nuclear shadowing and non - universal antishadowing . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus important to distinguish  static \" structure functions , the probability distributions computed from the target hadron s light - front wavefunctions , versus  dynamical \" structure functions which include the effects of initial- and final - state rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss related effects , such as the @xmath1 fixed pole contribution which appears in the real part of the virtual compton amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> ads / qcd , together with  light - front holography \" , provides a simple lorentz - invariant color - confining approximation to qcd which is successful in accounting for light - quark meson and baryon spectroscopy as well as hadronic lfwfs .    ` </S>",
