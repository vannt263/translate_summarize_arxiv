    "the study of wave mechanics and propagation in non - linear media is a fundamental concept within physics . in particular , solitons are a general non - dispersive solution to the one - dimensional non - linear wave equation .",

    "these self - trapped matter waves are supported by a balance between attractive atomic scattering interactions and repulsive zero - point kinetic energy between bosons . as well as being of fundamental interest in many - body quantum physics",

    "when realized in three - dimensions these solitons exist only as meta - stable states prone to catastrophic collapse @xcite .",
    "ultracold bose - fermi ( bf ) gases have received a great deal of recent experimental attention and have been realised through @xmath2li-@xmath3li @xcite , @xmath4na-@xmath3li @xcite , @xmath0rb-@xmath1k @xcite , @xmath5yb-@xmath6yb @xcite and @xmath7sr-@xmath0sr @xcite mixtures . at such low temperatures ,",
    "the scattering of atoms with non - zero relative angular momentum is heavily restricted such that _ p_-wave and higher interactions are typically negligible .",
    "furthermore , the pauli exclusion principle forbids identical fermions from interacting via _ s_-wave collisions .",
    "thus , for an ultracold bose - fermi mixture ( in which the fermions are identical ) , the dominant interactions are _ s_-wave boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that a repulsive bose gas and a non - interacting fermi gas co - existing in a radial waveguide can be coupled together by an attractive boson - fermion interaction to form a self - trapped state @xcite .",
    "it is these ` bose - fermi ' solitons that we will consider in this paper .",
    "we note that the @xmath0rb-@xmath1k system appears particularly well - suited to support bf solitons since its natural boson - fermion interaction is strongly attractive .",
    "however , just as in the case of an attractively - interacting 3d bose - einstein condensate @xcite , a 3d bose - fermi system is prone to collapse when the interspecies interaction becomes too attractive @xcite .",
    "while certain effects have been highlighted to raise the threshold for collapse , e.g. finite temperature effects in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite and feshbach resonance management @xcite , possession of angular momentum @xcite and fragmentation @xcite in bose - einstein condensates , the instability to collapse ultimately remains in the system .    by exploiting scattering resonances , the _ p_-wave interaction between fermions",
    "can now be experimentally engineered to significant values @xcite .",
    "it is thus the rationale of this work to explore the way in which _",
    "p_-wave interactions may modify bose - fermi soliton solutions .",
    "our framework to perform this is a variational approach using a gaussian ansatz for the boson and fermion density distributions . via the gross - pitaveskii model for the bosons and the thomas - fermi approximation for the fermions",
    ", we derive an analytic form for the energy of this coupled system up to _ p_-wave interactions ( for the boson - fermion and fermion - fermion interaction ) and from this we obtain the variational soliton solutions .",
    "first we review the properties of the soliton solutions in the absence of _ p_-wave interactions , in agreement with previous studies @xcite , before considering the modifications in the presence of _ p_-wave interactions .",

    "s_-wave scattering length between the species @xcite , and fermion - fermion _ p_-wave interactions , due to their capacity to be engineered experimentally @xcite .",
    "we consider a degenerate gas of identical fermions co - existing with a bose - einstein condensate of bosons , all at zero temperature . neglecting quantum and thermal fluctuations , we will model the fermion and boson gases within the mean - field picture . each gas is confined by an axially - homogeneous waveguide potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radial trap frequency experienced by the bosons @xmath10fermions@xmath11 and @xmath12 is the boson @xmath10fermion@xmath11 mass .",

    ". for overlapping clouds , the bosons and fermions additionally interact with each other , predominantly via the _ s_-wave interaction , of lengthscale @xmath15 , but we will also include the corresponding _ p_-wave interaction , with effective scattering length @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "bright solitons require an attractive interaction to enable self - trapping of the wave . here",
    "we shall consider the case where this interaction arises from the _ s_-wave boson - fermion coupling .",
    "a rudimentary requirement is thus that the boson and fermion gases are overlapping in space and this enables us to assume the same ansatz for the boson and fermion density distributions .",
    "we will assume that the radial profile of the fermion and boson gases is a gaussian .",
    "this is an exact result in the quasi-1d limit ( formally expressed as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the chemical potentials of the boson gas and fermion gas , respectively @xcite ) for which the radial profile coincides with the gaussian ground harmonic oscillator state . in the following",

    "[ fig : abf_vs_af_vary_nb ] demonstrates how these extensive soliton regions in @xmath141 space become modified for different @xmath157 .",
    "the presence of the `` fingers '' is sensitive to @xmath26 but the main region of solutions persists , albeit shifting to more negative @xmath15 with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "while here we have limited our study to the _ p_-wave interactions of only the fermions , the same qualitative soliton regimes and solutions are obtained if the _",
    "p_-wave boson - fermion interaction is included instead ( or , indeed , if both are included ) .",
    "this is because the _ p_-wave fermion - boson interaction has the same functional form ( scaling as @xmath158 ) .",
    "our results show that in the absence of _ p_-wave contributions the range of soliton solutions is rather limited , being confined to narrow bands in @xmath159 space . indeed",
    ", the solutions behave similarly to bright bosonic solitons but with an effective scattering length .",
    "while reducing the radial confinement widens the soliton bands , this also makes the system more prone to collective excitations which may disrupt the soliton . for a @xmath0rb-@xmath1k mixture and",
    "in the validity regime of our approach ( @xmath160 ) we can not locate soliton solutions at the native boson - fermion scattering length of @xmath161 .",
    "values of around @xmath162 are required to reach a soliton band at these atom numbers .",
    "the work of karpiuk _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated that atom numbers of order unity are required to support bose - fermi solitons at the native @xmath0rb-@xmath1k scattering length .",
    "while the scattering length can be engineered to large values through scattering resonance tuning , the ensuing soliton bands are so narrow that experimentally locating them is likely to be problematic .",
    "furthermore , there remains a collapse instability in the system and the ratio of bosons to fermions is constrained to small values .",
    "in contrast , the presence of repulsive _",
    "p_-wave fermion - fermion interactions has a dramatic stabilizing effect on the system .",
    "this can lead to a removal of the collapse instability such that the soliton solutions become _ global _ energy minima .",
    "we find extensive soliton regimes , in which the soliton minima are extremely deep , suggesting that they may form soliton structures that are considerably more robust than in the absence of _ p_-wave interactions .",
    "the _ p_-wave interaction also provides a strong tuning parameter , enabling the boson - fermion ratio to be dramatically varied .",
    "importantly , for a potential experimental realization of bf solitons , we find extensive soliton solutions at the native boson - fermion interaction and with only moderate fermionic interactions .    the remarkable capacity of repulsive _ p_-wave interactions to remove the collapse instability stems from the scaling behaviour of its energy contribution .",
    "denoting a generalized lengthscale of the gaussian wavepacket as @xmath163 , the total variational energy of the bose - fermi system is of the form , @xmath164 the first two terms , the kinetic and potential energy terms , are always positive .",
    "the last two terms , the _ s_-wave and _ p_-wave interaction energies , respectively , may be positive or negative . in the absence of _ p_-wave interactions , a negative _ s_-wave term will cause the energy to diverge to @xmath115 as @xmath165 , signifying the presence of the collapse instability . for non - zero _ p_-wave interactions , the _ p_-wave term dictates the fate of the system as @xmath165 and importantly , for positive _ p_-wave interactions the collapse divergence is completely removed .    it is important to note that this scaling behaviour originates from the thomas - fermi approximation and so is not limited to gaussian wavepackets . consider homogeneous bose and fermi gases in a large hard - wall box of volume @xmath166 .",
    "it is trivial to see from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : gp_energy_functional ] ) and ( [ eqn : fermion_energy_density ] ) that the energy scales as above , minus the @xmath167 term .",
    "thus it is clear that the capacity of repulsive _",
    "p_-wave interactions to stabilise against collapse is likely to extend to trapped bose - fermi mixtures in general .",
    "while we have presented results for _ p_-wave interactions in only the fermion - fermion case , we find qualitatively similar soliton regions , landscapes and conclusions when including boson - fermion _ p_-wave interactions instead .",
    "this is because the same energy scaling discussed above applies .    in conclusion , according to a variational model , the presence of repulsive _",
    "p_-wave interactions in bose - fermi mixtures removes the usual collapse instability and leads to stable , robust bright soliton solutions that are global energy minima of the system .",
    "we have discussed specifically the boson - fermion pairing of @xmath0rb and @xmath1k , but the stabilizing effect of repulsive _ p_-wave interactions should apply in general to other ultracold bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "given that the collapse instability has proved a major hindrance to the controlled generation , manipulation and interaction of matter - wave solitons to date , these more stable _",
    "p_-wave entities may provide a more versatile route to explore and exploit the special characteristics of solitons .",
