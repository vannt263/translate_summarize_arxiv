    "the investigation of resonance structures in light nuclei offers a rich source of information on many - body dynamics , nucleon - nucleon interaction , shell - structure , etc .",
    "conventionally , resonances are studied both experimentally and theoretically by analyzing certain observables ( cross sections , scattering amplitudes , phase shifts , etc . ) at _ real energies _ using the methods and concepts of scattering theory . however , in scattering theory resonances are defined through the analytic properties of certain quantities ( @xmath2 matrix , fredholm determinant , jost function ) at _ complex energies_. we believe that the theoretical study of few - nucleon scattering at complex energies offers a unique insight into the dynamics of these problems .",
    "we study selected resonances of @xmath3 = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 12 nucleon systems by exploring the analytic properties of the @xmath2 matrices at complex energies .",
    "the nuclei are described within the resonating group model ( rgm ) , assuming 2- or 3-cluster dynamics .",
    "certain @xmath2-matrix poles are also extracted from @xmath4-matrix fits of experimental data by extending the @xmath2 matrix , generated from the @xmath4 matrix , to complex energies .",
    "we use a microscopic two / three - cluster description of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 nuclei . here",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the cluster structures , assumed in the model , are indicated .",
    "we assume simple @xmath17 harmonic oscillator shell - model wave functions for the internal states of the clusters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , the relative motions between the clusters , which are the most important degrees of freedom , are treated with the rigor of few - body physics .",
    "the wave function of a two- and three - cluster system looks like @xmath21_s\\chi_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$ } ) \\bigg ] _ { jm } \\bigg\\ } ,   \\label{wfn2}\\ ] ] and @xmath22_s \\chi_{[l_1,l_2]l}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$}_1 , \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$}_2)\\bigg ] _ { jm } \\bigg\\ } ,   \\label{wfn3}\\ ] ] respectively . here",

    "we get equations for the unknown relative motion functions @xmath34 . for two - body",
    "( three - body ) bound states they are expanded in terms of ( products of ) gaussian functions , and the expansion coefficients are determined from a variational principle for the energy . for",
    "two - body scattering states the @xmath34 functions are expanded in terms of gaussian functions matched with the correct asymptotics , and the expansion coefficients are determined from the kohn - hulthn variational method for the @xmath2 matrix @xcite .    in scattering theory resonances",
    "are defined as complex - energy solutions of the schrdinger equation that correspond to the poles of the @xmath2 matrix ( or equivalently the zeros of the fredholm determinant or jost function ) . in order to obtain these complex solutions",
    ", we implemented a direct analytic continuation of the @xmath2 matrix for two - cluster systems @xcite and the complex scaling method for three - cluster systems @xcite .    for two - cluster systems we solve the schrdinger equation for the relative motion at complex energies with the the following boundary condition for @xmath35 @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the _ complex _ energies and wave numbers of the relative motions , and",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the incoming and outgoing coulomb functions , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath41 has no physical meaning , except if it is singular at the energy @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath41 coincides with the physical @xmath2 matrix describing a purely outgoing solution , that is a resonance .",
    "so we search for the poles of @xmath41 at complex energies and extract the resonance parameters from @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "for the three - cluster systems we solve the eigenvalue problem of a new hamiltonian defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the original many - body hamiltonian and @xmath45 is the complex scaling transformation which acts on a function @xmath46 as @xmath47 . in the case of a multicluster system the transformation is performed on each dynamical coordinate ( relative motion ) .",
    "the solution of the complex - scaled schrdinger equation results in a spectrum with continuum cuts rotated by @xmath48 relative to the real energy axis plus possibly a few isolated complex points at the resonance and bound state poles @xcite .",
    "we can perform a similar analysis of the analytic properties of the @xmath2 matrices in a model - independent way starting from the experimental data .",
    "the data can be described by the usual @xmath4-matrix method that works at real energies .",
    "then , an @xmath2 matrix can be constructed from this @xmath4 matrix and can be analytically continued to complex energies , and its poles can be localized @xcite .",
    "we call this procedure the extended @xmath4-matrix method .",
    "so far we have implemented this method for two - cluster dynamics .",
    "we briefly summarize the physics motivation and the main results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the methods , discussed above , were applied to selected resonances of various light nuclei .",
    "further details can be found in the original papers . in all of our rgm calculations we used",
    "the minnesota effective @xmath49 interaction @xcite which provides a reasonably good overall description of the low - energy @xmath50 scattering phase shifts @xcite and the bulk properties of the @xmath51h , @xmath51he , and @xmath52he clusters .    _",
    ": we searched for three - neutron resonances @xcite , which had been predicted from pion double charge exchange experiments on @xmath51he .",
    "all partial waves up to @xmath53 were nonresonant except the @xmath54 one , where we found a state at @xmath55 mev energy with 13 mev width",
    ". the parameters of the mirror state in the three - proton system are @xmath56 mev and @xmath57 mev . fig .",
    "1 shows the energy eigenvalues of the complex scaled hamiltonian for @xmath54 three - neutron states .",
    "the three - body continuum is rotated by @xmath48 and is discretized because of our finite variational basis .",
    "the position of the three - neutron resonance , isolated from the continuum line , is approximately independent of @xmath58 .",
    "we have also begun a charge - independent @xmath4-matrix analysis of @xmath59 data at energies below the breakup threshold @xcite .",
    "preliminary indications from the analysis are that a number of @xmath2-matrix poles exist is the @xmath2-wave and @xmath60-wave states , some of which are ( subthreshold ) virtual resonances .    _",
    ": we studied the @xmath61 state of @xmath52he @xcite , which state is notoriously difficult to reproduce in shell - models . in a @xmath62@xmath63 model , which reproduced well the relevant @xmath64 @xmath65 phase shift ,",
    "an @xmath2-matrix pole was found corresponding to @xmath66 kev and @xmath67 kev resonance parameters .",
    "this state was also localized with @xmath68 kev and @xmath69 kev parameters in an @xmath2 matrix that was constructed from a comprehensive @xmath4-matrix fit to the data .",
    "both calculations agree that this is the first excited state of @xmath52he , and is a conventional resonance between the @xmath65 and @xmath70 thresholds .    _",
    ": we studied the low - energy @xmath0he and @xmath0li resonances @xcite with the aim to resolve the apparent contradiction between the experimentally recommended resonance parameters and the ones that appear , e.g. , in the neutron halo studies of @xmath1he .",
    "our complex @xmath2-matrix resonance parameters coming from an @xmath71 rgm model and from an extended @xmath4-matrix model , respectively , were found to be in good agreement with each other .",
    "however , they differed from the conventional parameters , extracted from reaction cross sections at real energies . the most striking disagreement with the currently accepted resonance parameters @xcite is in the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states .",
    "our calculations predict a much smaller splitting than given in @xcite . in order to demonstrate the dependence of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath2-matrix pole positions on the spin - orbit strength ( @xmath74 ) we show the @xmath0he pole trajectories in fig .  2 .",
    "the solid square shows the result for @xmath75 , while the stars correspond to the physical value of the strength . by further increasing @xmath74 ,",
    "the @xmath72 state becomes bound .",
    "one can see that the behavior of the pole trajectory rules out the possibility that the spin - orbit splitting is larger than 2 mev .",
    "the low - lying three - body resonances of @xmath1he , @xmath1li , and @xmath1be were studied in an @xmath76 rgm model @xcite .",
    "our motivation was to confirm or refute the existence of a new type of collective excitations , the soft dipole resonance , in the neutron halo nucleus @xmath1he .",
    "this soft dipole resonance was supposed to arise from the oscillation of the halo neutrons against the @xmath52he core .",
    "as the coupling between the core and the halo is weak , this would result in a low - energy state compared to the usual giant dipole resonances .",
    "we found all experimentally known three - body resonances of the @xmath77 nuclei , but no indication for the existence of a @xmath78 state in @xmath1he .",
    "thus , using one of the most comprehensive models of that nucleus , we showed that the soft dipole resonance does not exist in @xmath1he .",
    "this result has been confirmed by other calculations in different models @xcite and by a recent experiment @xcite .    _",
    ": we studied the low - lying natural - parity three - alpha resonances in @xmath79c in order to shed light on the nature of the @xmath61 state @xcite .",
    "this state , which plays an important role in stellar nucleosynthesis , was believed to be a three - alpha resonance .",
    "however , there was no unambiguous proof to support this claim .",
    "we localized all known low - energy natural - parity states of @xmath79c by using @xmath49 forces which correctly reproduced the @xmath80be ground state resonance .",
    "we unambiguously showed for the first time in a microscopic model , that the @xmath61 state is really a three - alpha resonance .",
    "in summary , our study of resonances in light nuclei by means of the exploration of the analytic structure of the @xmath2 matrix at complex energies has proven to be very fruitful .",
    "we observe a good general agreement between the results of our rgm and extended @xmath4-matrix models .",
    "in contrast , resonance prescriptions formulated at real energies , can lead to quite different results from one another , especially for broad states .",
    "thus , we recommend using the complex @xmath2-pole prescription to specify resonance parameters in all cases .",
