    "recently , the statistical properties of real networks ( including biological , social and technological systems ) have attracted a large amount of attention among physicists ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been realized that despite functional diversity , most of real web - like systems share important structural features e.g. small average path length , high clustering and scale - free degree distribution .",
    "a number of network models have been proposed to embody the fundamental characteristics .",
    "the models can be roughly divided into two classes : static ( homogeneous , equilibrium ) and evolving ( causal , nonequilibrium ) .",
    "the second class of causal networks encompasses , in particular , the famous ba model @xcite , whereas configuration model @xcite and the large group of networks with hidden variables @xcite belong to the first class of static networks .",
    "although very intuitive , the mentioned representatives of static random networks are _ not properly _ defined from the point of view of the equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "below we briefly outline what the mentioned lack of _ seemliness _ means with reference to random networks .    to start with ,",
    "let us concentrate on the phrase _",
    "random network_. what does it mean that a network is random ?",
    "one possible answer is that there is a large amount of randomness in the process of network construction .",
    "it treats to all the examples of homogeneous and causal networks quoted in the previous paragraph .",
    "the answer however suffers a few disadvantages among which the most striking is the issue of quantification of the randomness .",
    "another answer to the asked question could be that random network is a member of a statistical _ ensemble _ of networks and the probability of the occurrence of a given network in random sampling is proportional to its statistical weight . without a doubt , the last treatment directly follows principles of the equilibrium statistical mechanics .    at the moment",
    ", a simple example could be the configuration model . in this model , the total number of nodes is fixed to @xmath0 and degrees of all nodes @xmath1 create a specific degree sequence @xmath2 . until now",
    ", nothing has been said about connections between nodes . as a rule ,",
    "random graphs with a given degree sequence are constructed in the following way : i. first , attach to each node @xmath3 a number @xmath4 of _ stubs _ ( ends of edges ) ; ii .",
    "next , choose pairs of these stubs uniformly at random and join them together to make complete edges .",
    "for sure , such a procedure represents a large randomness justifying the phrase _",
    "random networks_. on the other hand , however , the second among the mentioned possible meanings of the phrase , treating the resulting networks as members of the ensemble of graphs with the desired degree sequence , seems to be more familiar to physicists .    as a truth",
    ", the concepts of statistical mechanics ( including statistical ensembles , partition functions , averages over ensemble and so forth ) has already been applied to analysis of complex networks .",
    "although , the majority among the recently submitted articles still define network models through construction procedures , there has also been published several interesting papers on the _ genuine _ statistical mechanics of random networks ( cf .",
    "the general idea is similar to all the above mentioned papers",
    ". statistical ensemble of networks is defined by specifying a set of networks @xmath5 which one wants to study ( e.g. simple graphs , digraphs , weighted graphs ) and a rule that associates probability distribution @xmath6 with these networks @xmath7 .",
    "the differences between the quoted approaches consist in different weight assignment strategies .    in this contribution we extend the information - theoretic approach to random networks",
    "that was very recently proposed by park and newman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "information theory @xcite provides a criterion for setting up probability distributions over a given ensemble on the basis of partial knowledge and leads to a type of statistical inference .",
    "it is the least biased estimate possible on the given information i.e. it is maximally non - committal with regard to missing information .",
    "since the procedure consists in entropy maximization under constraints imposed by the physical conditions of the ensemble , it is also known as maximum - entropy estimate @xcite .    in this paper , following park and newman @xcite , we use shannon entropy in order to establish probability distribution over analyzed networks @xcite . park and newman",
    "have presented a few exact solutions ( in the sense of weighted averages over ensembles ) of specific network models including undirected networks with a given degree sequence and networks incorporating arbitrary but independent edge probabilities . here , we analyze these exactly solved models from the point of view fluctuations over ensembles .",
    "we discuss several fluctuation - dissipation relations for the mentioned ensembles .",
    "we also show that the quoted maximum - entropy models are equivalent to random networks with hidden variables @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the fundamentals of maximum - entropy random networks due to park and newman @xcite .    in order , to correctly define statistical ensemble of networks one has to start with specifying a set of graphs @xmath5 which one wants to study . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to labelled simple graphs @xcite with a fixed number of nodes @xmath0 .",
    "let us remind that a simple graph has at most one link between any pair of vertices and it does not contain self - loops connecting vertices to themselves . note also that there exists one - to - one correspondence ( isomorphism ) between simple graphs and symmetric matrices of size @xmath0 with elements @xmath8 equal either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "once the set @xmath5 of possible networks has been established , in the next step one has to decide what kind of constraints should be imposed on the ensemble .",
    "the choice may be , for example , encouraged by properties of real networks like high clustering , significant modularity or scale - free degree distribution .",
    "in fact , due to the mentioned isomorphism between graphs and matrices only such ensembles can be exactly solved which constraints are simply expressed in terms of adjacency matrix .    now",
    ", suppose that one would like to establish probability distribution over @xmath5 in such a way that the expected values ( i.e. averages over the ensemble ) of several observables @xmath11 , @xmath12 were respectively equal to @xmath13 . due to maximum entropy principle",
    "the best choice for probability distribution @xmath6 is the one that maximizes the shannon entropy @xmath14 subject to the constraints @xmath15 for @xmath12 , plus the normalization condition @xmath16 the langrangian for the above problem is given by the below expression @xmath17 where the multipliers @xmath18 and @xmath19 are to be determined by ( [ war1 ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "differentiating @xmath20 with respect to @xmath6 and then equating the result to zero one obtains the desired probability distribution over the ensemble of graphs with given properties ( [ war1 ] ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the network hamiltonian @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the partition function ( normalization constant ) @xmath25    finally , in order to complete the section devoted to general considerations it is useful to define the free energy of the ensemble @xmath26 the last quantity is of wide use in the rest of the paper .",
    "now , let us examine the introduced formalism with a few examples .",
    "in the next section , we will analyze fluctuations over the below presented ensembles .      at the beginning , let us study the equivalent of the microcanonical ensemble for maximum - entropy random networks . maximizing shannon entropy ( [ entropy ] ) subject to only normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) , i.e. omitting other constraints ( [ war1 ] ) , one obtains the uniform distribution over all simple graphs of size @xmath0 @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the total number of the considered networks i.e. the total number of @xmath29 symmetric matrices of size @xmath0 .",
    "the uniform distribution ( [ micpg ] ) means that each graph in the ensemble have the same weight regardless of its properties .",
    "since all graphs in the ensemble are equiprobable one can simply argue that the probability of a graph having @xmath30 links is given by @xmath31 and respectively @xmath32 similarly , the probability of an arbitrary node to have @xmath33 nearest neighbors equals @xmath34 , and the average connectivity is @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , the considered microcanonical ensemble of random networks is equivalent to the ensemble of classical random graphs with the connection probability @xmath36 .",
    "ensembles of classical random graphs with an arbitrary linkage probability will be considered in the next subsection .",
    "now , let us consider an ensemble of networks with an expected number of links @xmath37 ( as stressed before the ensemble is equivalent to random graphs introduced by erds - rnyi ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) for this ensemble is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents a field or an inverse temperature whose value is fixed and depends only on @xmath37 .",
    "park and newman @xcite have shown that the partition function ( [ z0 ] ) for the ensemble is equal to @xmath40 and respectively the free energy ( [ f0 ] ) can be written as @xmath41    having probability distribution ( [ pg0 ] ) over the ensemble one can , for example , find the relation between the average number of links @xmath37 and @xmath39 @xmath42 now , since @xmath39 is fixed one can reexpress the last formula in terms of the linkage probability @xmath43 that is known from the theory of classical random graphs @xmath44 where @xmath45    finally , let us point out that in the limit of very small fields @xmath46 ( high temperatures ) the ensemble of random networks with an expected number of links is equivalent to the microcanonical ensemble of random networks ( [ micpg ] ) introduced in the previous subsection .      at the moment , suppose that one would like to deal with random networks with an expected degree sequence @xmath47 in this case , the network hamiltonian is given by @xmath48 where the multipliers @xmath19 represent a kind of potential assigned to each node and they only depend on the expected degrees @xmath49 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ pkki ] ) and ( [ pkki1 ] ) ) .",
    "the partition function for the considered ensemble can be written as @xcite @xmath50 and the free energy is @xmath51    performing weighted averages over the ensemble one can easily prove the below identities : the first one describing the connection probability between two nodes @xmath3 and @xmath52 @xmath53 and the second identity for the average connectivity of a node characterized by the local field @xmath19 @xmath54 the both expressions show the reverse relation between the two parameters ( i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath19 ) characterizing each node .",
    "the relation consist in the statement : small degrees correspond to large multipliers and vice versa , nodes with a large number of connections possess small multipliers .",
    "park and newman @xcite have pointed out that instead of studying networks with an expected degree sequence ( [ pk_seq ] ) one can deal with networks characterized by an expected degree distribution @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the authors have argued that one can produce any degree distribution by a judicious choice of the distribution of multipliers @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , due to ( [ pkki ] ) , @xmath56 resulting in the desired @xmath55 can be determined from the below expression @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by ( [ pkki ] ) .",
    "there are , however , a few subtleties related to the transition between the sequence @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "first , the eq .",
    "( [ pkrt ] ) defines @xmath56 as an implicit function which , except for a very few cases , can not be explicitly calculated .",
    "second , performing such a transition one has to keep in mind that our phase space consists of labelled graphs in which every node @xmath1 has assigned its own multiplier @xmath19 ( i.e. is distinguishable ) .",
    "using @xmath56 makes an impression that the nodes lose their identities . in such a case",
    ", there exists a threat of widening the original phase space .    to proceed further ,",
    "let us consider _ sparse _ networks . in the case ,",
    "connection probabilities ( [ pkpij ] ) factorize @xmath61 where @xmath62 as shown in @xcite such ensembles are equivalent to uncorrelated networks .",
    "the relation ( [ pkki1 ] ) between expected degrees and its multipliers makes the ensembles very simple for both monte carlo simulations and analytical treatment .",
    "in particular , the distribution of multipliers ( [ pkrt ] ) corresponding to @xmath55 is simply @xmath63 where @xmath49 is given by ( [ pkki1 ] ) .",
    "there exist , however , some side effects of the approximation .",
    "first , since the connection probability @xmath64 , ( [ pkpij1 ] ) , thus the assumption of sparse networks is only valid for networks with non - negative lagrange multipliers ( i.e. @xmath65 ) .",
    "the restriction causes failure of the approach in the case of scale - free networks @xmath66 with @xmath67 . to existence of hubs",
    "@xmath68 @xcite , i.e. nodes with negative multipliers ( see comment after eq . ( [ pkki ] ) ) , spontaneously develop degree correlations @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite that one can omit the correlations by applying the so - called structural cutoff i.e. forcing the largest degree to scale as @xmath69 . at the moment , let us stress that the structural cutoff in uncorrelated networks naturally emerges form the eq .",
    "( [ pkki1 ] ) when @xmath70 .      in order to study random networks with two - point correlations",
    "one may consider a class of hamiltonians ( [ h0 ] ) constructed on the basis of an expected linkage probability @xmath71 in the last expression @xmath72 is an element of the adjacency matrix representing the graph @xmath73 and @xmath74 characterizes field coupled to the hypothetical link @xmath75 .",
    "the partition function and the free energy for the ensemble are given by @xmath76 comparing ( [ pkz ] ) and ( [ corzf ] ) one can see that the previous ensemble of networks with an expected degree sequence is a special case ( for @xmath77 ) of networks with arbitrary two - point correlations . similarly to ( [ pkpij ] ) one can also find that @xmath78",
    "in classical thermodynamics , fields interacting with a system have conjugate variables which represent the response of the system to perturbation of the corresponding field . for example",
    ", the response of a gas to a change in volume is a change in pressure .",
    "the pressure @xmath43 is the conjugate variable to the volume @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , the magnetization @xmath80 of a magnet changes in response to the applied field @xmath81 .",
    "the mentioned relations are produced by terms in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a field and @xmath84 is the conjugate variable to which it couples .",
    "note , that the above also holds for maximum - entropy random networks being the subject of the paper , where ( see eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) ) @xmath85    taking advantage of ( [ pg0])-([f0 ] ) , expectation values @xmath86 of observables @xmath87 can be calculated as first derivatives of the free energy with the appropriate field @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "( [ mer]),([pkki]),([corpij ] ) ) @xmath88 similarly , second derivatives of the free energy @xmath89 give the mean square fluctuations of the variables @xmath90 now , inserting ( [ sxi0 ] ) into ( [ varxi0 ] ) one obtains a very important result @xmath91 that is known as the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _",
    "the theorem states that fluctuations in an observable @xmath87 are proportional to the susceptibility @xmath92 of the observable to its conjugate field @xmath19 .",
    "let us remind that the susceptibility @xmath92 measures the strength of the response of @xmath87 to changes in @xmath19 .",
    "in reality , due to practical purposes , it is often simpler to analyze the susceptibility @xmath93 to other field @xmath94 that directly depends on @xmath19 ( [ fdt0 ] ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the transitional derivative .",
    "probably the best known example of the theorem ( [ fdt0 ] ) is the one arising from fluctuations of energy in the canonical ensemble @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the heat capacity ( or thermal susceptibility ) , whereas @xmath99 is the respective transitional derivative .",
    "another example relates fluctuations in the magnetization to the magnetic susceptibility @xmath100    the fluctuation - dissipation theorems ( [ fdt0])-([fdtm ] ) are interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they join both microscopic description ( left - hand side ) and macroscopic , properties ( right - hand side ) of the considered systems .",
    "second , they relate the actual state ( fluctuations ) of the systems to their future behavior ( response ) .",
    "third , due to fdt phase transitions certified by singularities in susceptibilities can also be reported by large scale fluctuations .",
    "extending the idea of the susceptibility one can consider what happens with a variable @xmath101 when one changes the value of a field @xmath102 . to study the problem one can define a generalized susceptibility @xmath103 which is a measure of the response of @xmath104 to the variation of the field @xmath102 @xmath105 again , the susceptibility @xmath103 is a second derivative of the free energy @xmath106 the issue of generalized susceptibilities is of special interest in lattice systems ( [ h00 ] ) , where the variables @xmath87 for @xmath12 may represent to the same observable but measured in different spatial points .",
    "then , susceptibility @xmath103 is just the two - point correlation function between sites @xmath3 and @xmath52 .    in the following",
    ", we will concentrate on fluctuations over a few selected ensembles of random networks .      at the beginning ,",
    "let us consider the ensemble of classical random graphs . by definition ,",
    "the average number of links @xmath107 is fixed in the ensemble . as stressed at the beginning of the section ,",
    "there exist , however , fluctuations around the average .",
    "in fact , the probability of a graph @xmath73 with @xmath30 links is given by @xmath108 the variance of the above distribution calculated from ( [ fdt0 ] ) is very similar to ( [ fdte ] ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the link capacity in classical random graphs .",
    "note that for a given network size @xmath0 the link capacity does not depend on the linkage probability @xmath111 ( classical ideal gases reveal the analogous behavior @xmath112 ) .",
    "now , let us continue with random networks characterized by an expected degree sequence ( [ pk_seq ] )",
    ".    taken advantage of ( [ pkpij ] ) and ( [ pkki ] ) , fluctuation - dissipation relations ( [ fdt0 ] ) for the ensemble may be written in the following form @xmath113 at the moment , before delving into the discussion of the last expression , let us note that the susceptibility @xmath114 is also given by the below formula @xmath115 where @xmath116 represents the link capacity . here , since @xmath117 the fluctuations in nodes",
    "degrees result only form the transitional derivative @xmath118 .",
    "the importance of the two above identities lies in the fact that from the fluctuations over degrees of nodes characterized by the same local field @xmath19 , one can deduce on the future behavior of the nodes in the face of possible changes in @xmath19 .",
    "large ( small ) fluctuations correspond to high ( low ) local susceptibility @xmath92 .",
    "now , let us note , that in the case of small degrees ( see also the assumption of sparse networks ( [ pkki1 ] ) ) , the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ pk_fdt1 ] ) gets a simplified form @xmath119 indicating the poissonian fluctuations . since however , in the case of sparse homogeneous networks one can omit the last term in ( [ pk_fdt1 ] ) , in sparse scale - free networks with the characteristic exponent @xmath67 , the mentioned term is dominated by hubs and the nodes susceptibilities @xmath92 are much smaller than their expected degrees @xmath49 .",
    "the total network susceptibility decreases making the system resistant against random changes in the landscape of multipliers and simultaneously susceptible to behavior of supernodes @xcite .    in order to establish the better understanding of the statement included in the last paragraph ,",
    "let us consider a trivial network consisting of @xmath0 nodes with expected degrees @xmath120 and one _ supernode _ with the tunable desired degree @xmath121 ( in the sequel , the parameters denoted by the star apply to the supenode ) .",
    "adjusting the degree of the supernode makes possible to smoothly pass between regular graphs ( for @xmath122 ) and star networks ( for @xmath123 ) ( see fig .",

    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] next , inserting the multipliers into ( [ pkpij ] ) and then taking advantage of ( [ pk_fdt1 ] ) one obtains the susceptibilities of expected degrees due to changes in the nodes intensive parameters .",
    "the relative susceptibilities are respectively given by @xmath128 for the bulk of nodes , and @xmath129 for the supernode .",
    "= 7.8 cm    the behaviour of susceptibilities ( [ pk_fdtex1 ] ) and ( [ pk_fdtex2 ] ) is depicted at the fig .",
    "one can see that the susceptibilities decrease to @xmath9 when the expected degree of the hub @xmath130 approaches @xmath0 . in the region of the vanishing susceptibilities , the small changes in the fields @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath126 poorly affect the topological features ( i.e. @xmath130 ) of the considered networks ( c.f .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the last statement supports our previous claim of the resilience of such networks against random external perturbations .",
    "the large @xmath130 makes that the supernode accumulates most of the links present in the system and causes that there exist relatively small number of network realizations which both : i. fulfill physical constraints of the ensemble and ii .",
    "possess significant statistical weights .",
    "for example , only one such a realization exists in the limiting case of the star network with @xmath131 .",
    "in the section , we continue the thread of poissonian fluctuations ( [ pk_fdt2 ] ) .    random networks with hidden variables are simply defined through the construction procedure that consists of only two steps :    * first , prepare @xmath0 nodes and assign them hidden variables independently drawn from the probability distribution @xmath132 , * next , each pair of nodes @xmath75 link with a probability @xmath133 .",
    "one can show , that the uncorrelated networks with hidden variables arise from the factorized connection probability @xmath134 whereas networks with two - point correlations require more sophisticated expressions for @xmath133 .    even comparing the above short review to our previous results on sparse networks with an expected degree sequence ( cf .",
    "( [ pkpij1 ] ) and ( [ rij ] ) ) , allows one to deduce on the equivalence of the two approaches . in the course of the section",

    "we will prove it by recovering the so - called poissonian propagators characterizing both correlated and uncorrelated sparse networks with hidden variables @xcite .      at the moment , it is clear that although the expected degree of the node @xmath3 is @xmath49 , but due to ensemble fluctuations its actual degree @xmath4 changes from network to network .",
    "our aim is to find the so - called propagator @xmath135 i.e. the degree distribution of the node given that it is characterized by the multiplier @xmath19 .    at the beginning , let us reformulate the probability of a graph @xmath73 in the ensemble @xmath136 where @xmath22 and @xmath24 are respectively the graph hamiltonian ( [ pkh ] ) and the partition function ( [ pkz ] ) .",
    "taking advantage of the connection probability @xmath137 ( [ pkpij ] ) , @xmath6 can be written in a similar form as in the case of classical random graphs ( [ er1pg ] ) @xmath138 where @xmath139 whereas @xmath8 are elements of the adjacency matrix describing @xmath73 and they are equal to either @xmath10 or @xmath9 depending on whether @xmath3 and @xmath52 are connected or not .    in the following , without the loss of generality , we will concentrate on the node @xmath140 . having @xmath6",

    "@xmath148    up to this point , the derivation of @xmath145 has been exact .",
    "now , before proceeding with approximations let us test the formula ( [ prop0 ] ) against the simplest ensemble i.e. networks with an expected homogenous degree sequence . in the ensemble ,",
    "all nodes have the same desired degree and also @xmath149 .",
    "it is easy to check that the degree distribution of an arbitrary node ( [ prop0 ] ) is given by @xmath150 where the binomial factor in the front of the expression arises from the fact that there exist @xmath151 different connection profiles corresponding to degree @xmath33 and @xmath152 ( [ pkpij ] ) ( please do not confuse it with ( [ per ] ) , where @xmath39 has a different meaning ! ) .",
    "one should not be surprised with the last result .",
    "if it is not obvious , let us stress that the ensemble of networks with an expected homogeneous degree sequence is in fact equivalent to the ensemble of classical random graphs . to become familiar with the statement compare the formulas ( [ zer ] ) and ( [ pkz ] ) .",
    "now , in order to recover the claim of equivalence between the considered maximum - entropy models and random networks with hidden variables one has to apply the mean field approximation to the expression ( [ prop0 ] ) @xmath153 where @xmath154 ( [ pkki ] ) .",
    "the assumption of sparse networks enables further simplification of the distribution @xmath155 recovering the result previously derived by sderberg @xcite for uncorrelated networks with hidden variables .",
    "the poissonian propagator ( [ prop2 ] ) indicates the mentioned equivalence of the considered maximum - entropy networks and the well - known class of uncorrelated random networks with hidden variables ( lagrange multipliers characterizing nodes correspond to hidden attributes ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the result is indeed very strong since it also holds for random networks with two - point degree correlations ( see eq .",
    "( [ prop3 ] ) and also eq .",
    "( 23 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the key point to notice with reference to the last expression is that in the region of small degrees , due to the poissonian fluctuations ( c.f .",
    "( [ pk_fdt2 ] ) and ( [ prop2 ] ) ) , the _ real _ degree distributions observed in single realizations of the considered networks strongly differ from the desired degree distribution @xmath55 . on the other hand , in the limit of large degrees the real distribution and the expected one converge .",
    "the interplay between the two distributions has been carefully studied in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "one can show that probability of a graph @xmath73 in the ensemble ( [ corh ] ) can be transformed into the same form ( [ pk1pg ] ) as the one for random networks with an expected degree sequence , where the linkage probability is given by ( [ corpij ] ) . performing the same calculations as in the case of ensembles analyzed in the previous subsection , one can prove that in the limit of sparse networks the degree distribution of a specific node is poissonian ( [ prop2 ] ) @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 represents the connection probability given by ( [ corpij ] ) .",
    "again , the last formula supports the claimed equivalence between the analyzed maximum - entropy networks with two - point correlations and the class of correlated networks with hidden variables @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have extended the information - theoretic approach to random networks that was very recently proposed by park and newman @xcite .",
    "we have concentrated on fluctuations over ensembles of undirected networks with non - interacting edges , including random networks with a given degree sequence and networks characterized by two - point correlations .",
    "we have studied a few fluctuation - dissipation relations characterizing susceptibilities of different networks to changes in the external fields . in the case of networks with a given degree sequence , we have argued that the scale - free topologies of real networks may arise as a result of self - organization of real systems into sparse structures with the low susceptibility to random external perturbations .",
