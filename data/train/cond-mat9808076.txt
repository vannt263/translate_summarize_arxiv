    "one of the main issues in colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites ( @xmath3,@xmath4)mno@xmath2 is to investigate how to control the electronic properties , especially these for transports , through magnetic field . in order to explain the ferromagnetism , zener@xcite introduced a model hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron hopping energy and @xmath7 is hund s coupling between itinerant electron and localized spins , and proposed the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism .",
    "anderson and hasegawa@xcite took the infinite @xmath7 limit of the model to discuss the ground state spin structure .",
    "however , at finite temperature , relationship between magnetism and electronic structure is not fully understood through these calculations . in the strong hund",
    "s coupling limit @xmath8 , mean - field theories which do not take into account effects of local spin fluctuations and neglect changes in electronic structure and lifetime of conducting quasiparticles are not sufficient to understand thermodynamic properties including the curie temperature @xmath9 as well as resistivity .",
    "therefore , a controlled method beyond the mean - field theory is necessary .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", recent improvements in precise control of the a - site cation substitutions revealed a complex phase diagram as a function of substitution , temperature and magnetic field , with various phases which exhibit magnetic , charge , orbital and lattice orderings.@xcite although the de hamiltonian can describe an antiferromagnet at half - filling and ferromagnetic metal at doped cases , it is clear that the model has to be extended in order to account for charge and orbital orderings .",
    "theoretically , investigations are performed on several microscopic models , especially emphasis on polaronic models , to reproduce varieties of phases with different behaviors in resistivity and phase transitions.@xcite however , due to such a complexity with variety of phases , there is no satisfactory theory so far to explain properties in the entire parameter region of substitutions and temperature .",
    "another point of view is to discuss magnetoresistance ( mr ) of manganites in relation with other materials such as cro@xmath10 or tl@xmath10mn@xmath10o@xmath11.@xcite especially , in various ferromagnetic metals , the half - metallic behavior due to de interaction is considered to cause so - called tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) through the spin valve mechanism.@xcite magnetoresistance of the material with artificially controlled grain / interface boundaries are also studied to realize a low - field mr device through tmr.@xcite    thus it is now important to discuss mr in manganites from the point of view of making distinction between generic de half - metal properties and specific behaviors of these compounds . in this paper , we focus on the bulk nature of the de systems in the ferromagnetic metal state .",
    "we study series of compounds which show the metallic ferromagnetism at the ground state , a canonical examples of which are la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 with carrier density @xmath12 , so - called ` high-@xmath9 ' compounds , and compare with the theoretical results obtained from the de hamiltonian .",
    "investigations are through its charge and spin excitation properties .",
    "we present a comprehensive study by putting together theoretical and experimental results which have been described only briefly in previous short papers and letters by the authors , and provide a unified picture of the charge and the spin excitation spectra through the electronic structure of the half - metallic de system .",
    "one of our aim is to establish the relevance of the half - metallic picture for the conduction electrons in these materials , and investigate the consequence of such a electronic structure to spin and charge dynamics through the de mechanism .",
    "we also discuss mr of the low-@xmath9 compounds such as la@xmath13ca@xmath14mno@xmath2 . in  2 ,",
    "we show theoretical results for de hamiltonian studied in a nonperturbative manner using the dynamical mean - field approach.@xcite in  3 , we show experimental results for spin wave lifetime with respect to relatively high @xmath9 samples of ( ( la , y),sr)mno@xmath2.@xcite in  4 , we show experimental results for optical spectrum for ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 as well as nd substituted low @xmath9 materials.@xcite section 5 is devoted for discussion and summary .",
    "we consider a de hamiltonian ( [ defdeham ] ) which is now also called as ferromagnetic kondo lattice model . since we consider the case where the localized spin is in a high - spin state and the coupling to itinerant electrons is ferromagnetic due to hund s rule ,",
    "the effect of quantum exchange is speculated to be irrelevant .",
    "especially , near the curie temperature @xmath9 thermal fluctuations should be dominant .",
    "thus we make an approximation to replace the quantum spins operators by classical rotators ( @xmath15 limit ) , namely we replace the spin operators @xmath16 in ( [ hamdxm ] ) by classical fields with norm @xmath17 .",
    "we introduce the dynamical mean - field ( dmf ) method for the above system . within this method ,",
    "the system is treated by a single site interacting with an electronic bath , m or the single particle green s function @xmath18 , which plays a role of a frequency - dependent weiss field.@xcite in the limit @xmath15 where dynamics of the spin in the imaginary - time axis does not exist , the single - site problem is exactly solved albeit the problem must be solved self - consistently with respect to the external bath . for details",
    ", readers are referred to ref .  .",
    "advantages of applying this method are : ( i ) thermal fluctuations of localized spins are taken into account in a non - perturbative way .",
    "finite temperature calculation in the thermodynamic limit is possible .",
    "( ii ) unlike the case for the hubbard model@xcite the single - site problem is solved easily so that no additional approximation is necessary .",
    "the problem is solved in either imaginary frequencies or real frequencies , so that electronic dynamics are obtained directly .        in fig .",
    "[ figdmfdos ] we show the electron dos @xmath19 in dmf on bethe lattice at @xmath20 and @xmath21 which gives ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "we set the magnetization to be @xmath22 direction .",
    "results are qualitatively the same as long as the strong hund s coupling region with ferromagnetic ground state is concerned .    in the ground state with ferromagnetic",
    "ordering for the localized spins , hund s coupling splits the electron dos into upper and lower subbands at @xmath23 , corresponding to the state parallel and anti - parallel to the ferromagnetically - ordered local spins .",
    "the width of the each dos is the bandwidth of the noninteracting system .",
    "therefore , in the case @xmath24 where zeeman splitting is larger than the bandwidth , we have a gap in dos .",
    "the conduction band is half metallic , namely the fermi surface exists only in one of the spin species .    in this system ,",
    "the origin of the half - metallic behavior is due to large hund s coupling @xmath25 .",
    "this state is in large contrast with itinerant weak ferromagnet which has smaller split of dos and the fermi surfaces in both spin species . in manganites with ferromagnetic metal state ,",
    "half - metallic behaviors are observed in various experiments including photoemission,@xcite tunneling junction@xcite and grain boundary tmr measurements.@xcite    at finite temperature , the spectra change in such a way that there exist two peaks at @xmath26 and its integrated weight transfers by magnetization .",
    "the center of the both peaks split by @xmath7 are roughly unchanged .",
    "both spin species have finite weight in lower and upper subbands . for the occupied lower subband , integrated weight scales as @xmath27 and @xmath28 for up ( parallel ) and down ( antiparallel ) bands , respectively , where @xmath29 is the magnetization of the local spin .",
    "due to particle - hole symmetry , the upper subband have the weight @xmath28 and @xmath27 for up and down electrons , respectively .",
    "the width of each sub - bands changes in the way that at higher temperature the bandwidth is reduced due to smaller hopping matrix element .",
    "this is easily understood , since the integrated weight of each subbands gives the spin polarization of the itinerant electron part , and in the strong hund s coupling limit it should be proportional to the spin polarization of the localized spin .",
    "the bandwidth of each subband becomes narrower than that for the ground state , which is understood from the reduction of the hopping matrix element.@xcite    above @xmath9 , the dos is still split into two bands , with the identical weight for both subbands in each spin species . within our approach ,",
    "there is no temperature dependence above @xmath9 .",
    "this is an artifact of the single - site approximation where spin correlation of finite length is not taken into account .",
    "however , for strong hund s coupling , we speculate that the overall spectrum shape which is split into two subbands do not change by finite size cluster corrections .    to investigate the majority - minority bands more precisely , green s function is calculated as follows . from the solution of the dmf at @xmath30 on a lorentzian dos system,@xcite we have the analytical form for the self - energy @xmath31 at the lower subband @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we also see a similar @xmath34 dependence of @xmath35 in semicircular dos .",
    "then , the lattice green s function is given in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 since spin - dependent dos is proportional to @xmath38 , we see the relation @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "let us discuss the low temperature limit @xmath41 . for the majority band",
    ", we recover the free - fermion behavior @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 at the ground state with full polarization @xmath45 .",
    "the minority band has different nature .",
    "we see the quasiparticle residue @xmath46 and the dispersion @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "this is well understood from anderson - hasegawa picture , that strong @xmath7 projects out the low energy minority band and also prohibits hopping among sites .",
    "what is found here that is not available through a simple mean - field treatment of the anderson - hasegawa s model is the lifetime of the minority electrons .",
    "the minority band has large linewidth @xmath49 due to large amount of scattering with localized spins in opposite direction , so that the propagation of minority electrons are incoherent and diffusive .",
    "then we have the width of the minority band @xmath49 despite real part of the quasi - particle energy becomes dispersionless .",
    "stoner susceptibility is calculated by @xmath50 here , correlation effects are taken into account through the self - energy correction in @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ figimpi ] we show @xmath52 at the brillouin zone corner @xmath53 for various temperatures , at @xmath20 and @xmath54 .",
    "we see two - peak structure at @xmath55 and @xmath56 which is explained from the @xmath7-split dos .",
    "the stoner absorption is produced from a particle - hole pair excitations with spin flip , which produces a peak at low energy from intra - band processes and another peak at @xmath57 from interband processes .",

    "the relation ( [ imchiscale ] ) is observed at all values of @xmath65 with weak @xmath65 dependence .",
    "this is explained from the fact that the low energy stoner absorption is constructed from a process with combinations of a minority particle and a majority hole carriers . since the majority and",
    "the minority bands have the spectral weight proportional to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , the low energy part of the stoner absorption is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath58-linear behavior comes from the fermi distribution function as is the case for the noninteracting fermion , since the initial and final state is limited in energy @xmath69 . in our case",
    ", the incoherence of the minority band gives the weak @xmath65 dependence .",
    "thus we have the scaling relation @xmath70 .",
    "the weak @xmath65 dependence is in large contrast with the conventional weak ferromagnet where minority band is also coherent , which gives strong @xmath65 dependence through its band structure .      within the framework of the dynamical mean - field theory , optical conductivity at finite frequencies",

    "we see ( i ) the two - peak structure of @xmath76 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and ( ii ) the transfer of spectral weight by temperature .",
    "the two - peak structure is due to the splitting of the dos at @xmath77 .",
    "the peak at @xmath78 corresponds to the drude peak which is due to the particle - hole excitation in the lower subband , while @xmath57 part is due to the the interband process between @xmath7-split bands . at @xmath79 , where dos is equally split for up and down spins ,",
    "the two - peak structure is most pronounce . in the ferromagnetic phase ,",
    "the weight is shifted from the high energy peak to the low energy peak , corresponding to the dos structure controlled by the magnetism .",
    "the width of @xmath76 for drude part becomes narrower as temperature becomes lower , due to the reduction of the imaginary part of the self - energy for the majority channel .",
    "the width of the interband process at @xmath56 is kept as large as a fraction of @xmath80 , since this process is transition into the minority channel which has the incoherent nature with linewidth @xmath49 .    in  4",

    "the scale of the change in the spectrum for a case when only the lower sub - band is playing a role is @xmath178 .",
    "however , the energy scale concerning the magnetic properties has a smaller energy scale determined by the de interaction , @xmath179 .",
    "thus a small change in magnetization causes a large change in electronic structures , _",
    "e.g. _ a change of temperature in the scale of 300k causes the change in optical spectrum at 3ev .",
    "such a huge change in dos spectrum controlled by a small amount of magnetic field is considered to cause sensitive change of transport properties as well as other thermodynamical properties.@xcite    similar phenomena happens for a correlated electron system in the vicinity of the mott transition.@xcite this case , the coherent temperature becomes small compared to the bandwidth , @xmath180 , so that the change in the scale of @xmath181 produce a large change in the electronic structures . for the de systems , however , the small energy scale @xmath182 and the large energy scale @xmath80 as well as @xmath7 coexists robustly , and such phenomena is commonly observed throughout the doping concentration .    in order to compare the theory with cmr compounds , we need to consider that their behavior changes by a - site substitutions .",
    "let us concentrate to the region @xmath183 where it is far from antiferromagnetic insulating phase at @xmath184 and the region with charge and orbital ordering at @xmath185 .",
    "the nature of the compound is roughly classified by the average radius of the a - site ions @xmath186.@xcite compounds with larger @xmath186 have to larger tolerance factor and larger mn - o - mn bond angle , which in general increase the effective electron hopping and hence @xmath9 .",
    "however , we should note that it is still controversial whether the phase diagram is controlled mostly by the bandwidth alone , _",
    "e.g. _ ionic size variation @xmath187 also plays some role to change @xmath9,@xcite and also the decrease of @xmath9 at lower @xmath9 region is much larger compared to the estimate from the change in @xmath186 .    a canonical example for the high @xmath9 compounds is ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 which is resistivity wise a good metal below @xmath9 , and incoherent metal with @xmath188 near mott s limit . the most well investigated compound ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 , where ca substitution creates smaller @xmath128 and larger @xmath189 , has lower @xmath9 , and shows metal to insulator transition at around @xmath9",

    "universal behavior of the magnetoresistance in the form @xmath193 is also consistent between theory and experiment .    together with the scaling relations described in this paper , de hamiltonian alone explains various experimental data in manganites with high @xmath9 .",
    "the mechanism of mr in the single - crystal of these high @xmath9 compounds are understood from double - exchange alone , namely due to spin disorder scattering.@xcite it is noteworthy that the local jahn - teller distortion is reported even in the metallic phase of ( la , sr)mno@xmath2,@xcite which might indicate that the effect of the lattice distortion ( small polaron formation ) is not so prominent for these compounds .",
    "it has been discussed that the roles of other interactions such as lattice distortion@xcite or orbital fluctuation@xcite are important in ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 . especially , the discrepancies in curie temperature as well as resistivity between the double - exchange alone model and cmr manganites are emphasized . however , as discussed above , accurate treatment on theoretical calculation and the bulk measurement of single crystal samples without grain effects show that the double - exchange model explains various thermodynamical properties of the high @xmath9 compounds such as ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 .",
    "let us now discuss the properties of compounds with lower @xmath9 , _",
    "e.g. _ ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 , which qualitatively show different behaviors .",
    "one of the major difference is that the resistivity above @xmath9 shows semiconductive temperature dependence .",
    "several theories based on microscopic models are proposed .",
    "polaron effects of jahn - teller distortions are introduced to explain the metal - insulator transition from the point of view of large polaron to small polaron crossover by magnetism.@xcite the idea of anderson localization due to spin disorder as well as diagonal charge disorder has also been discussed.@xcite    many of these proposals relate magnetism and transport through the change of the hopping matrix element @xmath194 as discussed by anderson and hasegawa.@xcite namely , in general , these scenarios discuss the existence of the critical value of hopping @xmath195 determined by polaron size or mobility edge , and explain the metallic state as large hopping region @xmath196 and the insulating state as small hopping region @xmath197 . however , in order to explain the experiments for resistivity , these scenario requires fine tuning of the parameters in the following sense ; to explain the fact that the metal - insulator transition always occurs in the vicinity of @xmath9 for various a - site substitution in both ionic radius and average valence changes , they require the pinning of the critical hopping @xmath198 for any values of carrier concentration as well as bandwidth and a - site randomness . note that @xmath199 is determined by the short range spin correlation @xmath200 and is a smooth and continuous function of temperature without an anomaly at @xmath9 .",
    "it is also required to explain the absence of the metal - insulator transition in high-@xmath9 compounds such as ( la , sr)mno@xmath2 at @xmath201 .    in order to investigate such controversial issues , it is important to discuss the difference of the resistivity properties in these compounds in comparison with other properties from the point of view of deviation from de behavior . concerning the charge dynamics , the effect of the a - site substitution is investigated as follows .",
    "optical conductivity measurements@xcite show that the @xmath7-split peak at around 3ev investigated in this paper remains as bandwidth is changed from wide to narrow .",
    "the bandwidth control causes changes in the spectrum at the peak structure around @xmath202 and the infrared quasi - drude ( incoherent ) structures . in a narrow band system ,",

    ", there exists a systematic behavior that broadening of the spin wave dispersion is prominent at the zone boundary.@xcite another unconventional feature in these compounds is the presence of the central peak well below @xmath9,@xcite which indicates the presence of the magnetic cluster and its diffusive dynamics . from the spin diffusion",
    "constant , the correlation length of the spin clusters are estimated to be @xmath208 .",
    "neutron elastic scattering measurements also observed the ferromagnetic cluster with correlation length @xmath209.@xcite    thus from the points of view of charge and spin dynamics , the observed systematic change as @xmath9 become lower is considered to be the formation of magnetic cluster with typical length scale of @xmath210 , accompanied by lattice distortion , or magnetoelastic polaron .",
    "inhomogeneities in charge and magnetic structures@xcite suggest that such polaronic cluster remain even at at low temperatures .",
    "possible micrograin formation due to charge segregation as well as phase separation between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains has also been discussed.@xcite    in the presence of ferromagnetic clusters , or magnetically isolated half metallic nanodomains , one can discuss the tunneling mr mechanism for half metals as the origin of the cmr behavior , as is commonly the case for polycrystals.@xcite instability of electronic phase separation@xcite is a candidate for the initial driving force for such phenomena , which is stabilized to form droplet structures due to long range coulomb interactions .",
    "another possibility is the effect of static potential disorder due to a - site cation @xmath143-@xmath211 distributions which causes charge inhomogeneities , as well as self - trapping effect of lattice polarons .",
    "the idea is consistent with the phenomenological explanation of resistivity in ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 by the two - fluid model@xcite which discusses the coexistence of a metallic conductivity path and an activation - type polaronic conductivity .    to summarize",
