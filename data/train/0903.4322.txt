    "the @xmath8 meson production is an important part of the study program of different nucleus - nucleus collision experiments in the whole range of collision energies : at the ags  @xcite , the sps  @xcite , rhic  @xcite , and even at deeply subthreshold energies at the sis  @xcite . as the longest - living vector meson , the @xmath8",
    "is considered to be a good probe of the collision dynamics : it would decay mainly outside the fireball and the daughter hadrons would be weakly affected by rescattering .",
    "the dominant hadronic decay is @xmath9 , hence , the production of @xmath8 s interplays with the production of strange mesons in nucleus - nucleus collisions and can provide a complementary information on the strangeness dynamics . as other neutral vector mesons , the @xmath8 contributes to dilepton production via decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath8 meson yields in the hadronic and electromagnetic channels  @xcite can reveal interesting information about the later stage of the collision  @xcite .    according to the su(3 ) quark model the dominant component constituting the @xmath8 meson is a spin - one bound state of @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks .",
    "hence , the hadronic interactions of phi mesons are subject to okubo - zweig - iizuka rule , which tells that the interactions of a pure @xmath14 state with non - strange hadrons are suppressed . in practice",
    ", the strict implementation of this rule would imply vanishing of @xmath15 and @xmath16 couplings .",
    "indeed , the ozi - forbidden reactions are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the ozi - allowed , e.g. , the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath8 meson production cross section is about  @xcite ~75 .",
    "[ ozisupp ] this value is , however , three times smaller than the one which follows from the su(3 ) symmetry and the experimentally known deviation from the ideal mixing between singlet and octet vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological models are able to reproduce the experimental cross section of the @xmath5 reaction by taking into account the ozi - violating @xmath18 coupling adjusted to reproduce the @xmath19 decay width  @xcite .",
    "the role of baryon resonances in this process was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the ozi suppression weakens the @xmath8 production only by the ordinary hadronic matter and is lifted in the quark - gluon medium , the strong , of the order indicated in ( [ ozisupp ] ) , enhancement of the @xmath8 yield was proposed in  @xcite as a signal of the quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "an enhancement of the @xmath8 yield was indeed observed in experiments albeit to a lesser degree : the ratio of the @xmath8 yield in a nucleus - nucleus collision normalized by the number of participating nucleon pairs to the @xmath8 yield in a proton - proton collision lies between 3 and 4 for ags / sps energies  @xcite . within the hadrochemical model  @xcite the factor 3 of enhancement in @xmath8 production could be explained only by assuming a decrease of hadron masses in hot and dense hadronic matter . in  @xcite the main contribution to the @xmath8 yields",
    "are given by the ozi - allowed process with _ strangeness coalescence _ @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the string - hadronic transport model urqmd  @xcite , in which the @xmath8 is produced mainly via @xmath22 reactions and no in - medium effects are included , systematically underestimates the @xmath8 production at sps energies , cf .",

    "gev / c  @xcite it was observed that the @xmath8 yield grows with the centrality more strongly than linearly in a similar way as the @xmath24 and @xmath25 yields do .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath26 production scales linearly with a number of participating nucleons  @xcite .    at the sis the @xmath8 production",
    "was studied at the beam energies about 2 gev per nucleon , which are less than the threshold energy of @xmath8 production in the nucleon - nucleon collision 2.6 gev .",
    "the fopi collaboration measured @xmath8s in ni+ni reaction at 1.93 @xmath23gev  @xcite . the reported ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath25 multiplicites is @xmath27 or @xmath28 depending on the temperature of the emitting source ( 130 mev and 70 mev , respectively ) which has to be assumed for an extrapolation to a full solid angle .",
    "these results are considerably larger ( at least by factor 4 ) than the very preliminary estimates announced in  @xcite",
    ". such a large @xmath8 abundance can not be described by the transport model  @xcite where @xmath8s are produced in reactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) with the dominant contribution from pion - nucleon reactions .",
    "the calculations with the iqmd code  @xcite underestimate the @xmath8 production data  @xcite , too .",
    "even the inclusion of other resonance channels @xmath32 and @xmath33 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite would not fully accommodate the results  @xcite on @xmath8 multiplicites .",
    "note that the strangeness coalescence process could not contribute much to the @xmath8 yield at these energies since kaons have a long mean free path and most likely leave the fireball right after its creation without any further interaction .",
    "the large value of @xmath34 reported in  @xcite seems to be confirmed by further analyses of the data  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results by hades experiments with ar+kcl collision at 1.756 @xmath23gev give also a comparable value for @xmath35  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to address some puzzles of the @xmath8 production in heavy - ion collisions at various energies and propose a new type of the @xmath8 production mechanism_the catalytic @xmath8 production _ by strange particles , e.g. the reactions yy , |k ny , y= , .",
    "[ cathprod ] in contrast to the strangeness coalescence reaction , here the strangeness does not hide inside the @xmath8 but stays in the system and the presence of @xmath36 mesons is unnecessary .",

    "the rates of various process are shown figure  [ fig : frates ] .",
    "the @xmath8 production in @xmath145 collisions starts of course at the very beginning and gradually falls off as the fireball cools down and expands .",
    "the rates of catalytic reactions increase , the more strange particles are produced , reach the maximum at ( 0.30.4)@xmath193 and drop off later . for set  i with the maximal temperature @xmath194  mev the net rate of catalytic reactions yields to that of @xmath5 . for set  ii with @xmath195  mev the rates become comparable for times @xmath196 . for @xmath197",
    "mev in set  iii the catalytic production of @xmath8 exceed the rate of the @xmath198 reaction already at @xmath199 . note that the numerical values for the rates in figure  [ fig : frates ] correspond to the fireball expansion time @xmath200  fm .",
    "if the collision lasts longer then the curves for catalytic reactions have to be scaled up by a factor @xmath201 , since the number of the strange particles is proportional to the expansion time .",
    "this will make the catalytic reaction efficient even for the smaller temperature in set  i.    the above estimates show that the catalytic processes can be potentially important for the @xmath8 production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is interesting now to investigate how they can affect other @xmath8 production patterns , and whether their dominance can lead to any contradiction with experimental data .",
    "we discuss now the centrality dependence of the @xmath8 production . changing centrality",
    "one changes the volume of the system .",
    "we will use the mean number of projectile participants , @xmath202 , as the measure for initial volume of the fireball created in the collision , @xmath203 .",
    "the @xmath202 can be directly related to the energy deposited in the zero - degree calorimeter , cf .",
    "if there is only one changing parameter with the unit of length as in the case of a symmetrical collision at a fixed collision energy , @xmath204 , the scaling properties of hydrodynamics imply that the collision time is of the order @xmath205",
    "the multiplicities of particle species which reach the full chemical equilibrium , e.g. pions and @xmath176s , are proportional to the volume of the fireball and scale , therefore , as @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "the multiplicity of kaons ( @xmath24 ) , which have a long mean free path and leave the system right after being produced , scales as @xmath208 . according to ( [ strange - dist ] )",
    "other strange particles should follow the @xmath24 scaling , @xmath209 .",
    "the number of produced @xmath8 mesons can be estimated as n_&~ & _ n t_0+_y t_0 + _ |k n t_0 + & ~ & a_convn_pp^4/3 + a_cat n_pp^5/3 the term @xmath210 is due to the conventional production reactions like @xmath198 whereas the term @xmath211 one corresponds to the catalytic reactions which contribute with an additional factor @xmath143 . for the ratios experimentally observed in ref .",

    "the systematics of @xmath8 rapidity distributions in pb+pb collisions at the sps is reported in ref .",
    "the distributions can be fitted with a sum of two gaussian functions placed symmetrically around mid - rapidity f(y , a,)= = , [ 2gauss ]    here @xmath219 is the rapidity in c.m system .",
    "the width of the distribution is characterized by the root mean square @xmath220 .",

    "@xcite pointed out that the width of the @xmath8 meson distribution does not fit into the systematics observed for the other mesons but increases much faster with the collision energy .",
    "it was emphasized in  @xcite that the steep rise of the @xmath8 distribution width can not be explained by the hadronic process @xmath225 .",
    "the rapidity distribution of @xmath8 from the latter process can be estimated as the product of @xmath24 and @xmath25 rapidity distributions .",
    "the width of the product was calculated in  @xcite under the assumption of the single - gaussian sources for kaons with @xmath226 and @xmath227 as _ k^+k^-=. [ gauss - rms ] we show this result on the right panel of figure  [ fig : rap ] by the dash - dot - dot line .",
    "the resulting width is much smaller than that observed in the experiment .",
    "question is if any other @xmath8 production mechanism can produce the steep rise of the @xmath221 with the collision energy .",
    "we note that the rapidity distribution of hyperons increases much faster than those for mesons as the hyperons are dragged with nucleons to forward and backward rapidities ( an effect of partial transparency ) .",
    "the @xmath221s of @xmath136 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are shown on the left panel in figure  [ fig : rap ] by solid circles .",
    "the distribution width for 158  @xmath23gev was not determined experimentally , therefore we calculated it from the rapidity distribution obtained theoretically in  @xcite within a hydrodanamic model which successfully reproduces the particle production .",
    "we assume that the rapidity distributions of particles do not change after some initial stage when nuclei are passing throuhgh each other .",
    "this implies the absence or weakness of acceleration and diffusion processes .",
    "the collision kinematics is restricted mainly to the exchange of transverse momenta .",
    "then the rapidity distribution of @xmath8s produced in the reaction @xmath228 is roughly proportional to the product of rapidity distributions of colliding particle species 1 and 2 .",
    "if the distributions are given by the two gaussian distributions ( [ 2gauss ] ) the rms of the resulting @xmath8 distribution is given by ^2_12= + = + + .",
    "[ rms12 ] this expression differs from ( [ gauss - rms ] ) applied in  @xcite . using the parameters of @xmath24 and @xmath25 from  @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ rms12 ] ) we obtain rmss for the @xmath229 reaction shown in figure  [ fig : rap ] ( right panel ) by dotted line .",
    "they are somewhat larger than those obtained in  @xcite but still much smaller than empirical ones .",
    "in contrast , the width of @xmath8 rapidity distributions from the reactions involving @xmath136 particles , @xmath230 and @xmath231 ( solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig : rap ] ) rises much faster and is comparable with the experimental results for beam energies between 20  @xmath23gev and 80  @xmath23gev . in collisions at 158  @xmath23gev",
    "the @xmath8 distribution is much broader than our estimates .",
    "perhaps , some new non - hadronic mechanism of the @xmath8 production becomes operative at this energy .",
    "in this paper we study a new mechanism of @xmath8 meson production in nucleus - nucleus collisions  the catalytic reactions on strange particles , e.g. , @xmath110 and @xmath232 .",
    "these reactions are ozi - allowed and their cross section can be by an order of magnitude larger than the cross section of conventional ozi - suppressed @xmath8 production reactions @xmath5 and @xmath233 , etc , considered so far .",
    "these reactions require only one strange particle in the entrance channel and therefore are less suppressed than the strangeness coalescence reactions , @xmath234 and @xmath235 in collisions where strangeness is statistically suppressed . using a hadronic lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) we estimate the @xmath110 and @xmath236 cross sections to be roughly of the order of 1  mb . in order to estimate the efficiency of the new reactions we calculate the evolution of the strangeness content of the fireball within a hadrochemical model .",
    "the main assumption we follow is that kaons ( @xmath24 and @xmath138 ) can leave the fireball freely after being created whereas the strange particles ( hyperons , @xmath25 and @xmath135 ) remain in the fireball in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "thus the net strangeness accumulated in the fireball is growing in the course of the collision .",
    "we compare the rates of @xmath8 production in the catalytic reactions and in the @xmath5 reaction .",
    "the former can be competitive in collisions with the maximal temperature above 110  mev and the collision time @xmath237  fm .",
    "the efficiency of catalytic reaction increases if some strangeness is presented in the fireball right in the beginning after the first most violent nucleon - nucleon collisions and if the fireball lifetime is longer .",
    "we discuss how the catalytic reaction could affect the centrality dependence of the @xmath8 yield .",
    "since the catalytic rates depend on the concentration of strange particles accumulated during some time , the resulting number of @xmath8s produced in such a reaction would grow @xmath238 , where @xmath143 is the collision time , in contrast to the number of @xmath8s from conventional reactions @xmath56 growing @xmath239 . in the scaling regime of hydrodynamics the collision time can be related to the typical length scale of the system determined by its volume @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the centrality criterion  the mean number of projectile participants .",
    "taking two types of processes into account we can parameterize the experimental centrality dependence of the @xmath242 and @xmath243 ratios measured in au+au collision at 11.7  @xmath23gev as follows 10 ^ 3 & = & 7 ( ) ^1/3 + 3 ( ) ^2/3 , + 10 ^ 2 & = & 1.7 + 1.4 ( ) ^1/3 , a=197 . here",
    "the first terms are due to the conventional reactions involving non - strange particles and the second terms are due to the catalytic @xmath8 production on strange particles .",
    "relative strength of two terms shows that the contribution of the catalytic reactions can be up to 30%40% at the ags energies for @xmath218 .    analyzing the @xmath8 rapidity distributions at sps energies we find that the strong rise of the distribution width with the collision energies between 20  @xmath23gev and 80  @xmath23gev can be explained by the @xmath8 production in @xmath164 and @xmath244 collisions .",
    "the present analysis of the catalytic mechanisms of the @xmath8 production is only exploratory and should merely serve as an invitation for further investigations .",
    "particularly , a more reliable calculation of the cross sections for the @xmath245 and @xmath236 reactions and fireball evolution is mandatory .",
