    "the beginning of study of an open chaotic system can be dated back to the papers refs . @xcite where the authors have analyzed the kicked rotor and similar systems with discrete time interacting with a heat bath . at this point",
    ", we note that quite generally , chaos in classically conservative and dissipative systems with noise , has completely different properties .",
    "for example , strange attractors on poincar section can appear only in dissipative systems . on the other hand , the manifestations of chaotic motion in open quantum systems , though widely studied , remain somehow not so clearly understood , both from the mathematical as well as from the physical point of view .",
    "one reason is that by including dissipation and decoherence , the computational effort grows drastically , since we have to operate with density matrices instead of wave functions",
    ".    the most successful approach that probes quantum dissipative chaos seems to be quantum tomographic methods based on the measurement of the wigner function , which is a quantum quasi - distribution in the phase space . in this way",

    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate properties of dissipative chaos for the other class of the simplest oscillatory open systems which possess some remarkable properties , particularly , symmetries in the phase space as well as a nonclassical statistics of excitation numbers .",
    "these symmetries can be formulated on the system hamiltonian and the master equation on one side or on dynamical equations of motion in the semiclassical approach on the other side . if the governing equations are invariant under a symmetric operation to some state variables an interesting question is arises whether this symmetry can be also seen in the chaotic regimes on the system attractors or the wigner functions .",
    "the answer of this question is very important for the deeper understanding of quantum dissipative chaos .",
    "the requirement in realization of this study is to have a proper quantum model showing both chaotic dynamics , symmetry properties and nonclassical statistics of excitation numbers . for this goal ,",
