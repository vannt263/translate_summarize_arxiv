    "it is generally accepted that the effective masses of particles will change with temperature and density due to medium effects .",
    "many theoretical considerations , including the finite temperature qhd model@xcite , brown - rho scaling@xcite , qcd sum rules@xcite , finite temperature qmc model@xcite , vacuum polarization feynman diagrams calculations@xcite and _ etc .",
    "_ , had been suggested to investigate the effective masses of mesons and nucleons . by means of the thermo - field dynamics , after summing the temperature- and density - dependent vacuum polarization diagrams for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 mesons and the three - line vertex diagrams which give the corrections of the nn@xmath0 , nn@xmath1 , nn@xmath2 , nn@xmath3 couplings respectively , we have extended the one - sigma@xcite , one - pion@xcite , one - omega@xcite and one - rho exchange potentials , and then the bonn potentials@xcite to finite temperature and density .",
    "we have found that the attractive part of the nn interaction becomes weaker and the repulsive part becomes stronger when the temperature and/or density of the system increase .",
    "this is of course very reasonable .    besides theoretical study",
    ", many experimental results which predict the changes of particle masses with temperature and density have been shown .",
    "in particular , the experiments of tagx collaboration have shown directly that when the density of the nucleon medium equals to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the saturation density , the effective mass of nutral @xmath3-meson reduces to 610mev@xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental results confirm that the medium effects are important for studying the nuclear or quark systems .",
    "to illustrate the medium effects more transparently in the theory instead of the first principle calculation , many authors introduced different hypothesis to represent the medium contributions to particle masses , for example , introduced the density - dependent vacuum energy @xmath6 to modify qmc model , suggested the density - dependent nn@xmath3 coupling to address liquid - gas phase transition , supposed the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark masses depends on density to mimic the quark confinment mechanism@xcite , introduced temperature - dependent vacuum energy @xmath10 to modify the quark mass density - dependent ( qmdd ) model@xcite , and _",
    "etc._. employing these hypothesis , many physical properties of nuclear matter , quark matter , nucleon system and hyperon system had been discussed .",
    "although the density- and temperature - dependent particle masses @xmath11 can mimic the medium effects , when we discuss the thermodynamical behaviors of the system with such particles , many difficulties will emerge .",
    "first , the dispersion relation for a particle with energy @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 becomes @xmath14^{1/2}\\ ] ] due to the medium effect .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the usual fundamental thermodynamical partial derivative relation is not satisfied for such system , we must add the additional terms .",
    "secondly , it is well known in thermodynamics that if we choose a pair of independent variables , for example , temperature @xmath15 and volume @xmath16 , and give the suitable characteristic thermodynamical function , for example , helmholtz free energy @xmath17 , then all thermodynamical quantities can be obtained by the partial derivatives of @xmath18 , because @xmath19 @xmath20 eq.(3 ) give the entropy and the equation of state respectively .",
    "other thermodynamical quantities such as internal energy @xmath21 , enthalpy @xmath22 , gibbs function @xmath23 , heat capacities @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be obtained from eq.(2 ) by derivatives . in above calculations ,",
    "no integral process will be needed and no integral constant has to be determined .",
    "in fact , this is the reason why all calculation of thermodynamical quantities in the canonical ensembles can be done with the calculation of the partition function @xmath26 , because the partition function @xmath27 is related to free energy @xmath28 directly . for systems with three independent variables ,",
    "say , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and chemical potential @xmath29 , the suitable characteristic function is the thermodynamical potential @xmath30 because @xmath31 but for system with density - dependent mass particle , @xmath32 is not only a function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath29 , but also of the density @xmath33 , because @xmath34 . how to treat the thermodynamics self - consistently is still a serious problem and has many wrangles in present references",
    ". we will give a brief review of various treatments and show their contradictory in the next section .",
    "a few comments on different treatments will also be presented there .",
    "this paper evolves from an attempt to suggest a new thermodynamical treatment to study the system with density- and temperature - dependent mass particles .",
    "since the particle mass depends on temperature and density , a lot of ambiguities will happen when one uses the partial derivatives along a reversible process to obtain the thermodynamical quantities . to avoid this difficulty , instead of a _",
    "reversible process _ , we argue that we can calculate the thermodynamical quantities at an _",
    "equilibrium state_. in fact , all the physical quantities , such as @xmath35 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are the functions of equilibrium state and have definite values respectively .",
    "we can use the relations between thermodynamical functions to obtain above quantities provided that the thermodynamic potential @xmath32 can be obtained .",
    "we will employ the qmdd model to explain our treatment in detail in sec.iii . by means of quark mass density- and temperature - dependent ( qmdtd ) model",
    ", we will show our results and the comparison to other treatments in sec.iv .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "there have been several different kinds of treatments dealing with the thermodynamics for the system with temperature- and/or density - dependent mass particles .",
    "the basic difficulty comes from eq.(1 ) while one calculate the partial derivative of thermodynamical functions along a reversible process .",
    "though several authors had still employed the usual direct formulae to calculate the thermodynamical quantities and shown @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the baryon density , @xmath40 is the number density of particle @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the corresponding chemical potential , and @xmath43 is the energy density .",
    "their failure is obviously because , with the temperature- and density - dependent mass term , @xmath32 is no longer an explicit function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath42 .",
    "the usual direct partial derivative formulae are not applicable . to overcome this difficulty , many different treatments or methods",
    "have been suggested in the market , which can be generally categorized into two kinds .",
    "\\(i ) the first kind of treatments takes the mass term as a function of density and/or temperature and make a great effort to work through the derivatives of a composite function along a reversible process . in deriving the energy density and the pressure ,",
    "extra terms emerge in this approach due to the dependence of the mass on the density and/or temperature .",
    "although many authors work along this direction to study the mass density and/or temperature dependence , their formulae and results are very different with each other .",
    "( ia ) . for the the density - dependent mass , in ref.@xcite",
    ", they gave @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 still satisfies eq.(6 ) .",
    "the extra terms in eqs.(8 , 9 ) produce significant changes in the energy density @xmath43 , and makes that the pressure become negative in low density regions .",
    "( ib ) . in ref.@xcite , for the density - dependent mass , the pressure and the energy density become @xmath47 @xmath48 they use the same pressure formula as that of ( ia ) eq.(8 ) , but do not agree with the expression in eq.(9 ) , because it can not give a correct qcd vacuum energy .",
    "then they use the same energy density formula as eq.(7 ) .",
    "( ic ) . in ref.@xcite , for the density- and temperature - dependent mass , the pressure and the energy density read @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 stands for the density of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "\\(ii ) the second kind of treatments add different terms to the system to keep the usual thermodynamical derivative relations unchanged .",
    "for example , in order to make the eq.(4 ) and the calculation of the thermodynamical potential self - consistently , they add extra terms to the hamiltonian or to the thermodynamical potential .",
    "these additional terms differ for different authors .",
    "( iia ) . to keep the fundamental thermodynamic relations @xmath52 self - consistently , in ref.@xcite , a term @xmath53 had been added to the hamiltonian .",
    "this term is determined by the condition @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the temperature- and density - dependent terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "then the pressure and energy density become @xmath56-b^*,\\ ] ] @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the degeneracy factor .",
    "( iib ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "an extra term @xmath60 had been added to the thermodynamical potential , @xmath61 where @xmath60 is determined by the constraint @xmath62 at zero temperature , the corresponding thermodynamical formulae become @xmath63 @xmath64^{1/2 } [ 6\\mu_i^2 - 3m_i^2(n_b)]\\nonumber\\\\&&-3m_i^4(n_b)\\ln[\\frac{\\mu_i+ [ \\mu_i^2-m_i^2(n_b)]^{1/2}}{m_i(n_b)}]\\}+\\omega_{\\alpha}(n_{b}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath65^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    in summary , from above treatments we come to a conclusion that how to treat the thermodynamics with the medium effect is still a serious problem and has made many wrangles in present references .",
    "in fact , many treatments are contradict with each other . to show their confusion and ambiguity , we give a few comments in the following :    ( 1 ) .",
    "the first argument is that the dispersion relation eq.(1 ) and the derivative formula of thermodynamical potential eq.(4 ) correspond to different conditions . in eq.(1 ) , the medium effect has been taken into account .",
    "this effect makes that the particle mass becomes a temperature- and density - dependent effective mass . but",
    "eq.(4 ) corresponds to the thermodynamical system only where @xmath32 , @xmath66 , @xmath15 , @xmath35 are the thermodynamical quantities of the system respectively .",
    "they do not include the medium effect . in order to make eq.(1 ) and the derivative formula of thermodynamical process self - consistent , instead of eq.(4 ) , we must establish a formula of thermodynamical process for the total system .",
    "it includes the variations of the quantities not only for the system , but also for the medium . in this formula ,",
    "all extensive quantities must be replaced by the quantity of the total system , for example , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the entropy of the system and the medium respectively .",
    "the problem is that so far we do not know how to calculate @xmath69 and other extensive thermodynamical quantities of the medium directly .",
    "( 2 ) . to illustrate above argument more transparently , we imagine two systems .",
    "these two systems are almost identical : their only difference is that one system consists of constant mass ( @xmath70 ) particles while the other of temperature- and density - dependent mass ( @xmath71 ) particles .",
    "fixed the temperature and density as @xmath72 and @xmath5 respectively , which satisfy @xmath73 at the equilibrium state with @xmath74 , obviously , the two system are completely the same . they arrive at and stay in the same equilibrium state and have the same thermodynamical quantities , such as the pressure and the energy density , which are just functions of equilibrium state .",
    "but if we use equations with partial derivatives to calculate these quantities of the later system , extra terms , such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eqs.(12 , 13 ) , emerge .",
    "these terms will never appear in the calculation of the former system since in this system @xmath70 is a constant .",
    "this simple example tells us that the first kind of treatments is not right because the medium effect has been neglected in eq.(4 ) .",
    "now we hope to give a brief comment on the second kind of treatments .",
    "they hope to add an extra term to the system to consider the medium effect .",
    "but unfortunately , in general , the extra term can not be determined by an additional constraint in terms of partial derivatives uniquely .",
    "it can not be expressed as a zero value of thermodynamical functions , because the effective mass @xmath11 comes from the interaction of the particle and the medium .",
    "this interaction depends on temperature and density . as an example , let s discuss the treatment ( iib ) .",
    "obviously , if we add an arbitrary temperature function @xmath77 to @xmath78 , the new expression for total @xmath79 still satisfies the constraint eq.(20 ) , but the additional arbitrary function of @xmath15 will change the thermodynamical functions , such as the entropy , which depend on the derivation of temperature .",
    "the above arguments impress us to give up the derivative calculation of thermodynamical quantities along a reversible process , since eq.(4 ) dose not include the medium effect . instead of studying the reversible process , we focus our attention on equilibrium states .",
    "we suggest a new treatment which is based on the equilibrium state in this section .",
    "we will show there is no ambiguity in our treatment .    according to the thermodynamics of equilibrium state , all thermodynamical functions such as @xmath32 , @xmath66 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath35 ... have definite values respectively at an equilibrium state .",
    "if we can calculate the thermodynamical potential @xmath32 and the gibbs function @xmath23 for a fixed equilibrium state , we can use the following definitions to find other thermodynamical quantities : @xmath80    to show our treatment explicitly , we employ the qmdtd model @xcite .",
    "the qmdtd model is extended from the qmdd model which was first suggested by fowler _",
    "_ many years ago @xcite .",
    "according to the qmdd model , the masses of @xmath7 , @xmath8 quarks and @xmath9 quark are given by @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the vacuum energy density and @xmath84 is the current mass of the strange quark .",
    "it is clear that the masses of quarks become infinity when the baryon density goes to zero , which means that the quark confinement in this model is permanent . to remove the permanent confinement of quark ,",
    "we modified the qmdtd model by introducing @xcite @xmath85@xmath86 where @xmath87.\\ ] ] the quark mass depends on both density and temperature , so it is called a qmdtd model .",
    "we have used this model to study the properties of strange quark matter ( sqm ) @xcite .    for the system of sqm , in which the masses of quarks satisfy eqs.(33 - 35 ) , at equilibrium state ,",
    "the thermodynamical potential of the system reads @xcite @xmath88 the internal energy @xmath21 and the gibbs function @xmath23 are @xmath89 @xmath90 respectively .",
    "other thermodynamical quantities can be obtained by eqs.(25 - 30 ) .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the antiquarks must be considered .",
    "the baryon density satisfies @xmath91 where @xmath92 + 1 } - \\frac{1}{\\exp[\\beta(\\epsilon_{i}(k)+\\mu_{i})]+1}),\\ ] ] ( @xmath93)@xmath46 is the number density of the ( anti)flavor @xmath94 , @xmath95 , for antiquark @xmath96 , following ref . , the system of sqm must satisfy the constraints @xmath97 because inside sqm , @xmath9 ( and @xmath98 ) quarks are produced through the weak process @xmath99 and similarly for antiquarks .",
    "the condition of charge neutrality reads @xmath100",
    "for the convenience of comparison , our numerical calculations have been done by adopting the parameters @xmath101mev@xmath102 , @xmath103mev and @xmath104mev , as that of ref.@xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in figs.1 - 4 and table i.    the energy per baryon vs. baryon number density @xmath39 is shown in fig.1 where the temperature is fixed at @xmath105mev . in fig.1 , the solid line refers to the present treatment and other four dashed lines refer to treatments in ref . ,",
    "ia , ib and ic respectively .",

    "but for ia , ib and ic treatments , the pressure becomes negative in the small energy density regions",
    ". the pressure will not be negative due to its thermodynamical treatment for a system with positive energy .",
    "this result confirms that our treatment is correct .    in ref.@xcite",

    "we hope to point out that this argument is not right because it is based on eq.(4 ) which has not taken the medium effect into account . in fig.4",
    "we draw the entropy per baryon vs. temperature curves for different baryon densities @xmath115 @xmath102 with dispersion relations @xmath116 , using our treatment .",
    "we even choose three different dispersion relations @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for the same baryon density @xmath119 and find that all curves get together at the point @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "it means that our treatment is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics no matter how the dispersion relation is .",
