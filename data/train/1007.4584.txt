    "the bijection mapping is as follows : given a non - crossing spanning tree on @xmath1 vertices , for each edge connecting @xmath29 to @xmath30 , draw a dotted line from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in a @xmath28-gon .",
    "then the quadrangulation of this @xmath28-gon is defined by quadrangles whose diagonals are the dotted lines ; conversely , given a @xmath28-gon , every quadrangle has a diagonal whose endpoints are odd numbers , so we may perform the reverse procedure to get an inverse mapping ( see figure  [ fig : eubijection ] ) .",
    "this bijection preserves the cyclic sieving phenomenon , since rotation by @xmath33 in the tree corresponds to rotation by @xmath34 in the @xmath28-gon .    in the latter case , reiner , stanton , and white showed in @xcite that polygon dissections of a polygon exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon where the cyclic action is also rotation .",
