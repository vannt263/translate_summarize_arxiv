    "since the discovery of quasicrystals in the early eighties @xcite considerable attention has been paid to the magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "while many quasicrystals contain atoms ( such as fe , mn , or rare - earth elements ) that carry local magnetic moments , these are usually screened very effectively , and consequently one finds a weak paramagnetic or diamagnetic behaviour , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , there has been ample experimental evidence for magnetic ordering in quasicrystals , including ferrimagnetic @xcite , ferromagnetic @xcite , anti - ferromagnetic @xcite , and spin - glass behaviour @xcite , though some results are still discussed controversially , see e.g.  @xcite , in particular with regard to the importance of crystalline phases present in the samples .",
    "even before magnetic ordering in quasicrystals had been observed experimentally , theoretical investigations on the influence of quasiperiodic order on magnetic properties commenced . in most cases ,",
    "the models considered were either one - dimensional quantum spin chains with aperiodic sequences of coupling constants or classical ising models on two - dimensional quasiperiodic graphs ; we refer the reader to the recent review @xcite for a rather complete list of references . recently",
    ", a symmetry classification scheme for magnetically ordered quasicrystals has been proposed @xcite .    in this context , it is one of the central questions whether quasiperiodic order influences the universal properties at the phase transition , such as the critical exponents , in comparison to the periodic case . there is a heuristic criterion due to luck @xcite on the relevance of aperiodicity . according to this criterion , the `` topological disorder '' encountered in two - dimensional quasicrystals , generated by the cut - and - project method , is irrelevant ; and hence an ising model on a quasiperiodic tiling should belong to the same universality class as the ising model on the square lattice .",
    "clearly , non - universal properties do in general depend on the particular system under consideration .",
    "for instance , the location of critical points of lattice models depends in a systematic way on the structure of the graph on which the model is defined , see @xcite and references therein .    in this article",
    ", we consider high - temperature expansions of the free energy for zero - field ising models on two planar quasiperiodic graphs , the decagonal penrose @xcite and the octagonal ammann - beenker @xcite tiling .",
    "the technique of high - temperature expansions is well known , see e.g.  @xcite ; it was developed several decades ago and has since been applied to a variety of periodic lattices in both two and three dimensions . with regard to previous work on high - temperature expansions of quasiperiodic ising models ,",
    "we are only aware of two articles by abe and dotera @xcite who compute the expansion of the free energy up to the eighth order for the penrose tiling and its dual , and of a few numerically calculated expansion coefficients for the susceptibility for the penrose case @xcite . employing a systematic procedure ,",
    "we are able to compute the exact values of the coefficients up to the 18th order for both the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling .",
    "this requires much more effort than the calculation for periodic lattices , because the number of graphs that one has to take into account grows tremendously with the order .",
    "although our expansions are still not yet sufficient to extract good estimates for the critical temperatures or the critical exponents , we can show that our results are consistent with those obtained by different methods .    presently , the most accurate data on the transition temperature and the critical exponents stem from monte - carlo simulations @xcite . besides graphical expansions and monte - carlo simulations ,",
    "further methods have been employed to gain information about the critical behaviour of quasiperiodic ising models .",
    "first of all , exactly solvable cases can be constructed as , for instance , the ising model on the so - called labyrinth tiling @xcite , see also @xcite for further examples .",
    "these models correspond to particular choices of coupling constants , restricted by the requirement of integrability , and thus might not be representative for the general situation . for the solvable models based on the idea of `` @xmath1-invariance '' ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein , the critical behaviour necessarily is the same as for the periodic case , but one does not get a clue whether this extends to the general case , or whether it is at least the generic situation .",
    "secondly , there is an interesting approach using lee - yang zeros @xcite , which are complex roots of the partition function in certain variables .",
    "simon and baake @xcite calculated the zeros of the partition function for a large patch of the ammann - beenker tiling numerically and drew conclusions about the critical temperature and the critical exponents .",
    "furthermore , renormalization group techniques were applied to study the ising model on two - dimensional quasiperiodic tilings @xcite . in that case , one exploits the self - similarity of quasiperiodic tilings , which translates into a renormalization procedure that , however , can only be treated approximately in general .",
    "we note that for one - dimensional quantum ising chains with aperiodically modulated coupling constants , corresponding to two - dimensional layered ising models , renormalization techniques may yield exact results for the critical behaviour @xcite . in this case",
    ", the modulation is one - dimensional , and in accordance with luck s criterion @xcite one finds that the critical behaviour depends on the fluctuations of the aperiodic sequence of coupling constants .",
    "so far , all results appear to be in accordance with luck s criterion , including a recent monte - carlo study of the three - state potts model on the ammann - beenker tiling @xcite .",
    "still , most approaches are based on numerical or approximative treatments .",
    "in contrast , it is our aim to obtain exact values of the coefficients for the high - temperature expansions in the present paper , which is organized as follows . in the subsequent section",
    ", we briefly recall the graphical high - temperature expansion of ising models . in ,",
    "we discuss the generation of subgraphs of quasiperiodic tilings and the computation of their occurrence frequencies . then , in , we present our results for the coefficients of the high - temperature expansions for the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling . the corresponding implications for the critical behaviour are discussed in . in , we compare our results with exact calculations of the partition functions of periodic approximants .",
    "finally , in , we present our conclusions .",
    "we now give a brief account of the high - temperature expansion for the free energy of an ising model on a graph without an external field @xcite .",
    "let us consider a finite graph @xmath2 containing @xmath3 sites ( vertices ) with @xmath4 neighbour pairs of vertices connected by bonds .",
    "we emphasize that , throughout the paper , the notion of neighbouring vertices refers to vertices connected by a bond , and not to the geometric distance between the vertices .",
    "for instance , in the penrose tiling discussed below , the short diagonal of the small rhomb corresponds to the smallest distance between vertices , but does not constitute a bond . at a vertex @xmath5 , we place an ising spin @xmath6 ; and two spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 located at neighbouring vertices @xmath5 and @xmath9 interact with a coupling constant @xmath10 which we assume to be independent of the position .",
    "hence the energy of a spin configuration @xmath11 on @xmath2 is given by @xmath12 where we sum over all neighbour pairs @xmath13 connected by bonds as mentioned above .",
    "the logarithm of the partition function @xmath14 \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\left[\\cosh ( \\beta j)\\right]^{m } \\sum_{\\bsigma } \\prod_{\\langle j , k\\rangle } \\left [ 1+\\sigma_{j}\\sigma_{k}\\tanh ( \\beta j)\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is , apart from a factor @xmath15 , the free energy .",
    "it can be expanded as @xmath16 } +   n\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty } g_n\\ , w^n \\ ; , \\label{eq : expansion1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 with boltzmann s constant @xmath18 and temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the expansion variable @xmath20 is small for high temperature , hence the notion high - temperature expansion .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath21 are related to the number of subgraphs of @xmath2 containing @xmath22 bonds .",
    "the terms in the expansion can be rearranged in a different fashion which is more convenient for our needs ( see page 382 in @xcite ) @xmath23 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & n\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty } g_n\\ , w^n   \\ ; = \\ ; \\sum_{r } ( c_r ; { \\cal g})\\ , k_r(w ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : expansion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we now sum over all _ connected _ subgraphs @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 denotes the so - called _ lattice constant _ of @xmath24 in @xmath2 , counting the number of ways @xmath24 can be embedded in @xmath2 .",
    "the weight functions @xmath27 depend only on @xmath24 , not on @xmath2 . in our case , without external field , we can restrict the sum to so - called _ star graphs_. these are graphs that can not be dissected into two disjoint subgraphs by eliminating a single vertex .",
    "the weight functions @xmath27 in equation can be calculated from the partition function @xmath28 of the subgraph @xmath24 .",
    "for this aim , let us generate all star subgraphs and arrange them in a sequence @xmath29 such that @xmath30 can not be embedded in @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , the lattice constant @xmath33 may be non - zero only if @xmath34 , which , in general , does not determine the sequence uniquely . having arranged the subgraphs in such a way , the expansion for a subgraph @xmath24 gives @xmath35 and , taking into account that @xmath36 , we obtain the corresponding weight @xmath27 @xmath37 expressed in terms of lattice constants @xmath33 and weights @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we can compute the weights @xmath27 successively provided we know the partition function @xmath28 and the lattice constants @xmath33 of all star graphs @xmath30 that are subgraphs of @xmath24 .",
    "we note that we can rearrange the sum in equation as @xmath40 where @xmath41 labels closed loops @xmath42 consisting of @xmath22 bonds , and @xmath43 are all possible complete `` fillings '' of the loop @xmath42 . by `` fillings '' of a loop we mean all proper subgraphs of @xmath2 which have the loop as their boundary . here , the functions @xmath44 have the form @xmath45 hence truncating the sum over @xmath22 in equation yields all terms in the expansion up to @xmath22th order in @xmath46 .",
    "the calculation of the weight functions @xmath47 can be performed in analogy to that of the weight functions @xmath48 .    in summary , in order to calculate the high - temperature expansion of the ising model to order @xmath49 we have to perform the following steps :    1 .",
    "generate all loops @xmath42 in the graph @xmath2 consisting of @xmath50 bonds ; 2 .",
    "construct all fillings @xmath43 of @xmath42 ; 3 .",
    "calculate @xmath51 , the logarithm of the partition function for the subgraphs @xmath43 ; 4 .",
    "calculate the lattice constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; 5 .",
    "compute the weight functions @xmath44 by successive use of the analogue of ; 6 .",
    "calculate the expansion .",
    "we are now in the position to apply this scheme to the case of quasiperiodic graphs .",
    "in fact , we want to obtain the expansion for the ising model on an infinite quasiperiodic graph @xmath2 . therefore , we have to compute the corresponding `` averaged lattice constants '' per vertex @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes finite patches with @xmath3 vertices approaching the infinite graph @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , we need to calculate the occurrence frequency of a subgraph @xmath24 in the infinite graph @xmath2 .",
    "the main challenge now is to compute these quantities for a given quasiperiodic graph and all of its subgraphs up to a certain size .    for quasiperiodic graphs generated by the cut - and - project method @xcite",
    "the frequencies of subgraphs can be computed exactly . in the cut - and - project method ,",
    "one starts from a higher - dimensional periodic lattice , and projects a certain part of it onto a lower - dimensional `` physical '' or `` parallel '' space @xmath56 .",
    "for the two cases of interest , the penrose and the octagonal ammann - beenker tiling , the lattices have to be at least four - dimensional , the minimal choice being the root lattice @xmath57 for the penrose case @xcite and the hypercubic lattice @xmath58 for the octagonal case @xcite .",
    "the root lattice @xmath57 can be considered as a sublattice of @xmath59 , wherefore the latter , albeit not minimal , is frequently used to generate the penrose tiling .",
    "the physical space @xmath60 is determined as an invariant subspace with respect to the relevant subgroup ( in our examples the dihedral groups @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) of the point group of the periodic lattice .",
    "its orthogonal complement , the perpendicular space @xmath63 , is then also an invariant subspace of this symmetry .",
    "the quasiperiodic tiling is now obtained by projecting all those lattice points onto @xmath60 whose projection onto @xmath63 falls into a certain set called the `` window '' or `` acceptance domain '' @xmath64 . in the minimal case",
    ", this acceptance domain has the same dimension as @xmath63 ; however , if we project the penrose tiling from the hypercubic lattice @xmath59 , the perpendicular space is three - dimensional and the acceptance domain consists of four regular pentagons @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) situated on equidistant , parallel planes , and two isolated points ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , see . for the ammann - beenker tiling ,",
    "the situation is simpler ; the acceptance domain , which is obtained as the projection of the four - dimensional hypercube to @xmath63 , is a regular octagon @xmath69 .",
    "now , considering an arbitrary motive @xmath70 consisting of a collection of @xmath71 points @xmath72 in physical space , we can compute its occurrence frequency , i.e. , how often translated copies of the point set occur in the infinite tiling .",
    "associated to the set @xmath70 of points in physical space is a corresponding acceptance domain @xmath73 in perpendicular space , obtained by intersecting @xmath71 copies of the acceptance domain @xmath64 shifted appropriately with respect to each other .",
    "this corresponds to the acceptance domain filled by choosing a reference point of the motive @xmath70 , and , for all occurrences of the motive in an infinite tiling , lifting the positions of this reference point to the higher - dimensional lattice and projecting to @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the area of @xmath75 , divided by the area of @xmath64 , is the occurrence frequency of our motive , as follows from the uniform distribution on the acceptance domain , see @xcite and references therein .    in the penrose case , the acceptance domain @xmath75 consists of four pieces @xmath76 ( @xmath66 ) which have to be taken into account .",
    "they are given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 if @xmath79 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath80 and @xmath81 have the form @xmath82 with integer coefficients @xmath83 which correspond to the coordinates of the lattice point in @xmath59 that projects to @xmath84 . the first component of @xmath85",
    ", @xmath86 denotes the so - called translation class of the point @xmath84 , which just labels the part of the acceptance domain @xmath87 where the corresponding perpendicular projection lies . in figures [ fig : ad1 ] and [ fig :",
    "ad2 ] , we show two examples where the motives are the `` fattest '' loops , in terms of the enclosed area , of length @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the penrose tiling that contribute to the high - temperature expansion .    for the eight - fold ammann - beenker case there is only one acceptance domain @xmath69 , hence @xmath90 where the projections to @xmath60 and @xmath63 are given by @xmath91 here , @xmath92 denote the coordinates of the lattice point in @xmath58 that projects to @xmath84 .",
    "the acceptance domains of a motive @xmath70 are intersections of convex polygons and hence themselves polygonal , see figures  [ fig : ad1 ] and [ fig : ad2 ] .",
    "it is readily seen that the coordinates of the vertices of the acceptance domains belong to certain extensions of the field of rational numbers @xmath93 . for the penrose tiling",
    ", one has to perform the calculation in the field @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the golden ratio , satisfying the quadratic equation @xmath96 . for the ammann - beenker case ,",
    "the corresponding number field is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the `` silver mean '' that is a solution of the quadratic equation @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , in order to compute the occurrence frequency of a given motive @xmath70 in the tiling @xmath2 , we have to determine the area of the acceptance domain carrying out the calculation in the appropriate number field . the averaged lattice constant @xmath100 is the occurrence frequency of @xmath70 summed over all possible orientations of the motive . in these quasiperiodic tilings ,",
    "the frequencies of motives are independent of their orientation , hence we do not need to calculate them separately , but just have to count how many orientations of the motive occur in the tiling .",
    "let us focus on the penrose tiling as an example .",
    "rotating the motive @xmath70 by an angle @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) essentially corresponds to a rotation of the acceptance domain by @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , also the mirror image @xmath104 of the motive @xmath70 occurs with the same frequency , since the corresponding acceptance domains @xmath105 are just @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , in our expansion , it is advantageous to jointly consider graphs which are mirror images of each other because they give the same contribution .",
    "for this reason , we assign two symmetry factors @xmath107 and @xmath108 to each of these graphs , @xmath109 counting the number of rotations by angles @xmath101 which do not map the graph onto itself , and @xmath110 if reflection does not map the graph onto itself or onto a rotated copy of itself , compare figures [ fig : ad1 ] and [ fig : ad2 ] .",
    "the averaged lattice constant @xmath100 , as defined above , is thus @xmath109 times the area fraction obtained for a fixed orientation of the graph @xmath70 .",
    "multiplying @xmath100 by the factor @xmath111 , we can restrict the sum in equation to graphs that are non - equivalent under reflection .",
    "eventually , we have to consider all star subgraphs of the quasiperiodic tiling , corresponding to all possible fillings of loops .",
    "in contrast to the case of simple planar ( periodic ) lattices , a loop in the quasiperiodic tilings can have several fillings , which may occur with different frequencies . in figures [ fig : df1 ] and [ fig : df2 ] , the possible fillings , together with the corresponding frequencies , of two exemplary loops in the ammann - beenker tiling are shown .",
    "in orthogonal space , the different fillings correspond to a dissection of the acceptance domain of the loop into non - overlapping parts , see figures [ fig : df1 ] and [ fig : df2 ] .    in order to avoid confusion",
    ", we would like to point out once more how our frequencies are normalized , i.e. , what the numbers given in figures [ fig : df1 ] and [ fig : df2 ] really mean .",
    "we emphasize that the frequency we compute is _ not _ the frequency of a particular loop of length @xmath22 among all loops of the same length .",
    "instead , it gives the probability that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to the particular loop , in an arbitrary orientation .",
    "the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling are both bipartite graphs , which means that all closed loops have an even number of edges , and at least four .",
    "therefore , for zero magnetic field , only even powers of @xmath46 occur in the expansion that takes the form @xmath112 where @xmath55 denotes a finite patch of the quasiperiodic graph @xmath2 containing @xmath3 vertices , and @xmath113 is , apart from a factor @xmath15 , the free energy per vertex .",
    "we calculated the expansion coefficients @xmath114 up to @xmath0th order in @xmath46 for both the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling .",
    "the results are presented in .",

    "the results are presented in tables [ tab : exppenrose ] and [ tab : expammann ] .",
    "clearly , with increasing size of the approximant , the coefficients approach those of the quasiperiodic system , and the coefficients of the largest approximant are already quite close to those of the quasiperiodic case .",

    "the result is shown in . although we included terms up to order @xmath533 , the data for the two periodic approximants do not lie on straight lines , in contrast to those of the square lattice .",
    "instead , they show large fluctuations , and apparently the fluctuations for the smallest approximant with @xmath330 vertices in the unit cell turn out to be much larger than those for the larger approximant which contains @xmath336 vertices",
    ". it would be interesting to have a better understanding of this phenomenon , perhaps an investigation of the complex - temperature phase diagram of the periodic approximants can give an explanation of this observation .",
    "again , also shows that the data for the second approximant are already rather close to that of the quasiperiodic tiling , and one might conclude from that the fluctuations in the ratios of expansion coefficients become less with increasing size of the approximant .",
    "we considered the ising model on two planar quasiperiodic graphs , the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling .",
    "we calculated the leading terms of the high - temperature expansion of the free energy exactly , using the embedding of the quasiperiodic tilings into higher - dimensional periodic lattices to compute the occurrence frequencies of patterns in the tiling .",
    "these frequencies are expressed in terms of characteristic quadratic irrationalities related to ten- and eightfold rotational symmetry , the golden mean @xmath534 and the silver mean @xmath98 for the penrose and the ammann - beenker tiling , respectively .",
    "the number of graphs that contribute to a given order in the expansion grows much faster with the order than for a simple periodic lattice , therefore we did not go beyond the 18th order in the expansion variable @xmath535 in this work . from our expansion alone ,",
    "it is difficult to extract information about the critical behaviour .",
    "however , using estimates of the critical temperature obtained by other methods to analyze our data , we find that our expansions are in accordance with the the conjecture that ising models on such planar quasiperiodic graphs belong to the onsager universality class .    in order to compute the expansion coefficients , we had to construct all polygons on the quasiperiodic graphs with up to @xmath536 edges .",
    "thus , we obtain the average number of such self - avoiding polygons as a by - product of our calculation .",
    "comparison with earlier results on self - avoiding walks @xcite , based on enumerating walks that start from a chosen vertex in the tiling , indicates that the self - avoiding polygons on the examples we considered belong to the same universality class .",
    "in particular , this means that the corresponding critical point is described by the same exponents as for the hexagonal lattice which are known analytically @xcite .    finally , we considered periodic approximants of the quasiperiodic tilings . for these it is , in principle , possible to compute the free energy of the infinite periodic system analytically . here , we are only interested in the leading terms of the free energy , which we compare with those of the infinite quasiperiodic tiling .",
    "we find that , at least for the leading orders in @xmath46 , the rational coefficients of the approximants converge rapidly towards the irrational coefficients obtained for the quasiperiodic tiling .    in conclusion",
    ", it is doubtful whether the computational effort necessary to extend the expansions to higher order will result in a considerable improvement of the estimates of the critical properties . instead , it might be more rewarding to consider periodic approximants and use methods as those outlined in and @xcite to compute physical quantities , such as for instance the magnetization or correlation functions .",
