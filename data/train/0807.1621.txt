    "we explore , in lattice qcd , the static potential of the three - body glueball system composed of three gluons , using wilson loops .",
    "the interest in three - body gluon - gluon - gluon systems is increasing in anticipation to the future experiments besiii at ihep in beijin , gluex at jlab and panda at gsi in darmstadt , dedicated to study the mass range of charmonium , with a focus in its plausible hybrid excitations . even before the glueballs are discovered , the study of two - gluon and three  gluon glueballs are respectively relevant to the pomeron @xcite and to the odderon @xcite .",
    "thus several models of three - gluon models have already started to be developed @xcite .",
    "the relevance of computing the static potentials in lattice qcd for 3-gluon models is partly motivated by the plausible existence of a constituent mass for the gluon .",
    "several evidences of a gluon effective mass of 600 - 1000 mev , much larger than @xmath3 , exist from the lattice qcd gluon propagator in landau gauge , @xcite , from schwinger - dyson and bogoliubov - valatin solutions for the gluon propagator in landau gauge @xcite , from the analogy of confinement in qcd to supercondutivity @xcite , from the lattice qcd breaking of the adjoint string @xcite , from the lattice qcd gluonic excitations of the fundamental string @xcite from constituent gluon models @xcite compatible with the lattice qcd glueball spectra @xcite , and with the pomeron trajectory for high energy scattering @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "even for modelling massless gluons , the knowledge of a static potential would at least provide one of the components of the dynamical potential .",
    "for instance , the static quark - antiquark potential is frequently applied to light quarks .",
    "the wilson loop method was devised to extract , from pure - gauge qcd , the static potential for constituent quarks and to provide a detailed information on the confinement in qcd . in what concerns",
    "gluon interactions , the first lattice studies were performed by michael @xcite and bali extended them to other su(3 ) representations @xcite .",
    "recently okiharu and colleagues @xcite studied for the first time another class of exotic hadrons , extending the wilson loop of three - quark baryons to tetraquarks and to pentaquarks .",
    "very recently , bicudo , cardoso and oliveira continued the lattice qcd mapping of the static potentials for exotic hadrons , with the study of the hybrid quark - antiquark - gluon static potential , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the three - gluon potentials in lattice qcd .",
    "we address two novel and important questions . noticing that with three gluons two different colour singlets can be constructed , symmetric or antisymmetric , we study whether the respective interactions are identical or different",
    ". this will be further detailed in section ii .",
    "moreover , noticing that a gluon may couple to one adjoint string , or to a pair of fundamental strings , we study whether the potential is amenable to a triangle - shaped triplet of fundamental strings or to a starfish - shaped triplet of adjoint strings , as depicted in fig . [ starfish ] .",
    "a similar discussion on the shape of the baryonic strings has been addressed in lattice qcd @xcite    ( 350,90)(0,0 ) ( -20,-20 )    in particular , our study of the hybrid system already indicated @xcite that it would be interesting to study three - body glueballs , relevant for the odderon problem @xcite .",
    "notice that in lattice qcd , using the adjoint representation of su(3 ) , bali @xcite found that the adjoint string is compatible with the casimir scaling , where the casimir invariant @xmath4 produces for the @xmath5 interaction a factor @xmath6 times larger than the @xmath7 interaction . with three gluons , a triangle formed by three fundamental strings might costs less energy than three adjoint strings with a starfish - like geometry , depicted in fig .",
    "[ starfish ] .",
    "the three - gluon potential may be similar to a sum of three mesonic - like quark - antiquark interactions , plus a repulsion acting only when there is superposition of the fundamental strings .",
    "this question is also related to the superconductor ( type - i versus type - ii ) model for confinement , where flux tubes repel each other in type - ii superconductors , while in type - i superconductors they attract each other and tend to fuse in excited vortices @xcite .",
    "a first evidence of qcd string repulsion was indeed found in our very recent study of the hybrid potential @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the three - gluon potential in 3 + 1 dimension lattice qcd will further clarify our understanding of confinement .    in section ii",
    "we derive a class of wilson loops adequate to study the static hybrid potential .",
    "this paper is mainly analytical , and in section iii we discuss theoretically the important questions of the best wilson loops to distinguish the triangle from the starfish string groundstates , and of the differences of the symmetric to antisymmetric potentials . in section iv we present the first results of our numerical monte - carlo simulations , and conclude .",
    "we first construct a wavefunction with three gluons",
    ". this wavefunction will be the starting point of the wilson loop .",
    "due to confinement , a hadron , system composed of quarks , antiquarks or gluons , must be a colour singlet .",
    "each gluon is a state of the adjoint , or octet @xmath8 , representation of @xmath9 . with the tensor product of two gluons ,",
    "different representations of @xmath9 can be constructed , @xmath10 including a singlet @xmath11 and two octets @xmath12 .",
    "when we couple three gluons , we get not just one colour singlet , but two colour singlets ( plus many other representations ) , resulting from coupling this third octet to each of the two octets in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ twooctet ] ) , @xmath13 to arrive at the wavefunction for the two colour singlets , it is sufficient to study the product of two gell - mann matrices , since it already produces the relevant colour singlet and colour octets resulting from eq .",
    "( [ twooctet ] ) , @xmath14 and thus the product of three gell - mann matrices already produces the two possible colour singlets , that we single out in the trace of the product of the three gell - mann matrices , @xmath15 and thus the two possible color singlet wavefunctions of three gluons are , @xmath16 where the first combination is anti - symmetric and the second is symmetric with respect to the exchange of two gluons .",

    "the starfish - like a linear term is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the sum of the distances of the gluons to the fermat -torricelli point , minimizing the total distance of the adjoint strings in the starfish - like model .      to conclude , we show that there are two , and only two , symmetric and antisymmetric , three - gluon static potential .",
    "we derive the two respective wilson loops and study them analytically .",
    "we perform numerical tests , verifying that our wilson loop is correct .",
    "notice that the three - gluon wilson loops include products of up to three fundamental wilson loops , technically difficult to compute .",
    "we thus leave the systematic numerical exploration of the three - gluon wilson loops for future works .",
