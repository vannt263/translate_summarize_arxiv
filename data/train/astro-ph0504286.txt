    "supernovae ( sne ) are a major source of the mechanical energy input in galaxies and possibly in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . on average ,",
    "an sn releases about @xmath0 of kinetic energy carried by the ejecta which drive a blastwave into the ambient medium .",
    "how far this blastwave goes and how fast the energy is dissipated depend sensitively on the density and temperature of the medium .",
    "core - collapsed sne represent the end of massive stars , the bulk ( if not all ) of which form in ob associations .",
    "the energy release from such an association , highly correlated in space and time , has a great impact on the surrounding medium .",
    "initially , the energy release from the ob association is primarily in form of intense ionizing radiation from very massive stars , which tends to homogenize the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "after a couple of @xmath1 years , fast stellar winds start to play a major role in heating and shaping the medium , creating a low - density hot bubble @xcite , probably even before the explosion of the first sn in the association .",
    "later , after about @xmath2 years of the star formation ( if more - or - less coeval ) , core - collapsed sne become the dominant source of the mechanical energy input into the already hot surrounding @xcite .",
    "this combination of the concerted feedbacks , lasting for @xmath3 years  the lifetime of an 8@xmath4 star , leads to the formation of a so - called superbubble of low - density hot gas enclosed by a supershell of swept - up cool gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion of such a superbubble is expected to be substantially faster than typical ob association internal velocities of a few @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , a majority of core - collapsed sne ( @xmath6 ) should occur inside their parent superbubbles ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "sne from lower mass stars ( e.g. , type ia ; e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly important in early - type galaxies and possibly in galactic bulges and halos , are also expected to occur mostly in low - density hot media .",
    "the interstellar remnants of such sne are typically too faint to be well observed individually .",
    "but in terms of both heating and shaping the global ism / igm , such `` missing '' remnants are probably more important than those commonly - known and well - studied supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "though spectacular looking , they are atypical products of sne ( e.g. , from run - away massive stars ) , which happened to be in relatively dense media .",
    "surprisingly , there has been little work toward the understanding of the snr evolution in hot media with relatively high pressure .",
    "almost all the existing studies assume an ambient medium with both low temperature and low pressure ( e.g. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; @xcite ) or relative high in temperature but still low in pressure ( e.g , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if both the ambient gas temperature and pressure are low ( e.g. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , much of the snr evolution may then be described by the self - similar sedov solution @xcite , which assumes that both the thermal energy and radiative cooling of swept - up gas are negligible .",
    "the ambient gas with both high temperature and high pressure makes two differences : ( 1 ) the shock is weak due to the high sound speed and ( 2 ) thermal energy of the swept - up gas is not negligible .",
    "sedov ( 1959 , p238 - 251 ) made a linear approximation to the pressure effect , but did not account for the high temperature effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite briefly mentioned the behavior of an snr shock asymptotically reaching the sound speed , but studied primarily the cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "@xcite considered the snr evolution in a cloudy medium , including thermal evaporation .",
    "although the inter - cloud medium in this case is hot ( @xmath13 ) , the average ambient pressure is still low ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the characteristic temperature and pressure inside galactic bulges and elliptical galaxies are about 2@xmath153 orders of magnitude higher than the values used in these snr studies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite simulated an snr in a hot medium with relative high pressure ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , but focused only on the ejecta .",
    "in short , we are not aware of any simple description or simulation of the snr evolution in the hot media typically for galactic bulge and elliptical galaxies .    we have closely examined the snr evolution in the relatively low - density and high pressure hot media .",
    "the evolution of such an snr is significantly different from those in a relatively dense and cold environment . while the low density means that the sn energy loss rate is slow , the high pressure makes the swept - up thermal energy dynamically important .",
    "furthermore , the expansion speed of the blastwave is always above the sound speed of the hot ambient medium with the value of a few hundred @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the snr can expand to a large volume and distribute its energy in a rather uniform fashion . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate these effects , based chiefly on 1-d high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our simulations use the newly released flash code ( version 2.4 ) , which allows for modular , adaptive - mesh , and parallel simulations and solves the hydrodynamic equation explicitly ( @xcite and references therein ) to accurately capture a shock front , we use a uniformly spaced grid with a spatial resolution of about 0.01pc .",
    "we assume that the sn explosion is spherically symmetric and the ambient medium is uniformly distributed with identical temperature ( @xmath19 ) and density ( @xmath20=@xmath21 ) .",
    "the number density of particles is @xmath22 where @xmath23 for fully ionized gas with the solar abundance .",
    "an sn energy @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is deposited inside a small radius @xmath26 .",
    "the ambient gas is assumed to be mostly ionized .",
    "the cooling is neglected in the simulations ( further discussion in  4 ) .",
    "table [ t : parameters ] lists the setup parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 ) of a few representative cases , which are characteristic of the galactic bulge ( a ) , giant elliptical galaxies ( b ) , and rich clusters of galaxies ( c ) .",
    "the table also lists various inferred parameters to be discussed in the following sections .",
    "we have experimented with various energy deposition schemes @xcite .",
    "if the explosion energy is initially deposited as heat uniformly in a small volume , a sedov solution can be quickly reached . on the other hand , depositing the energy in the form of kinetic energy leads to many small - scale structures due to various internal shocks especially inside the ejecta . with or without ejecta ( assumed to have a total mass of 1.4 @xmath4 ) do affect the evolution before the swept - up mass becomes dominant compared with the ejecta . however",
    ", a specific choice of the initial conditions does not significantly affect our conclusion on the overall structure and evolution of the snrs .",
    "we output simulation results every 100 years .",
    "the radius of the outer shock front ( @xmath28 ) corresponds to the position where the gradients of the pressure and velocity are the largest .",
    "the shock front velocity ( @xmath29 ) is estimated from the @xmath28  difference between two consecutive steps .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the local @xmath28  and @xmath29   estimates is limited by the finite resolution in both time and spatial step sizes",
    ". an adaptive smooth of the @xmath29evolution is performed to reduce the step - by - step fluctuation .",
    "the uncertainties in these calculations in individual steps do not affect the actual _ evolution _ of these parameters , which are determined by the internal hydrodynamic solutions in the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : cmp_rsh_vsh ] shows the evolution of @xmath28  and @xmath29  for the three cases listed in table [ t : parameters ] . in all cases , the initial free - expansion stage is short and ends when the swept - up mass roughly equals to that of the ejecta .",
    "the expansion then more - or - less follows the self - similar sedov solution : @xmath30 where @xmath31=1.14 for gas with @xmath32=5/3 .",
    "but , the sedov phase does not last long if the ambient medium has a high temperature .",
    "the evolution gradually deviates from the sedov solution , as the blastwave expansion asymptotically approaches the sound speed of the ambient medium .",
    "based on these asymptotical behaviors ( neglecting the brief free - expansion phase ) , we find that the following expression gives a simple generalization of the sedov solution , approximately characterizing the blastwave evolution in a low - density hot medium ( to an accuracy of @xmath33 ; see the bottom panels of figure [ fig : cmp_rsh_vsh ] ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sound speed of the ambient medium , and @xmath36 is a characteristic time which can be obtained from the sedov solution by equaling @xmath37 and @xmath38 when @xmath39 : @xmath40^{1/3}. \\label{eq : tc}\\ ] ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsh ] ) , one can easily estimate the mach number @xmath41 of the blastwave as function of time , e.g. , @xmath42 at @xmath43 and a strong shock ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 , or about a few @xmath46 years .",
    "for ease of reference , table  [ t : parameters ] also lists the time and the swept - up ambient mass when @xmath47 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs_sedov ] ) is not valid even before @xmath43 .",
    "subsequently , the blastwave expands with a low mach number and will eventually be dissipated by radiative cooling and turbulent motion , which can not be accounted for here in 1-d simulations , however .",
    "but the expansion speed would not fall below the sound speed .    by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : vsh ] , we further derive the blastwave radius , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the generalized hyper - geometric function .",
    "the characteristic parameter @xmath36 has a clear physical meaning . within the radius @xmath50 ,",
    "the ambient thermal energy swept up by the blastwave is @xmath51 where @xmath52=0.6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 characterizes the time when the swept - up thermal energy is about twice the explosion energy .",
    "note that for a given @xmath24 , @xmath53 depends only on the ambient pressure , but @xmath36 depends on both the density and the temperature .",
    "( [ eq : vsh ] ) and ( [ eq : rsh ] ) generalize the sedov solution , by accounting for both temperature and density effects of the ambient medium .",
    "the temperature effect is reflected in the explicit dependence of the snr evolution on @xmath35 . when @xmath54 ( thus @xmath55 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vsh ] ) and ( [ eq : rsh ] ) become the sedov solution . in general , @xmath56 is determined by @xmath57 , which depends only on @xmath58 ( eq . [ eq : vsh ] ) , and @xmath53 . in other words , @xmath57 is uniquely determined by @xmath56 for a given @xmath53 .",
    "( [ eq : vsh ] ) and ( [ eq : rsh ] ) show that both @xmath29  and @xmath28  could have substantially larger values than what are predicted by the sedov solution , while @xmath57 is generally low .",
    "therefore , the snr blastwave heating is locally gentle and is over a large volume in the low - density hot medium .",
    "figure  [ fig : snrs_structure ] illustrates the radial structure of our simulated snrs ( case a as an example ) . at the early stage ( before time a ) the snr maintains a strong shock and the post - shock gas moves forward at a speed greater than the sound speed of the ambient gas .",
    "a low pressure region gradually develops inside the snr due to the adiabatic expansion , as shown in the pressure panel .",
    "remarkably , both density and temperatures can fall below the ambient values .",
    "therefore , the cooling rate , hence the x - ray emission , of this region can be very low .",
    "the pressure at the snr center reaches the minimum at time b. later , the post - shock gas starts to flow back and the central pressure increases , gradually approaching the value of the ambient medium ( time c - e ) .",
    "but , the under - pressure region behind the widening blastwave front remains .",
    "figure  [ fig : ener_evolution ] shows the conversion of the explosion energy to the thermal and kinetic energy of the swept - up medium as a function of time , which depends weakly on the specific initial conditions except for the first several @xmath59 years (  2 ) .",
    "in addition to the explosion energy , the blastwave also redistributes the thermal energy of the swept - up ambient medium .",
    "while the energies are redistributed widely , the ejecta are confined within relatively small regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmp_rsh_vsh ] ( left - hand panel ) includes the evolution of the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and the swept - up ambient medium of case a with @xmath60 ejecta .",
    "the discontinuity reaches a maximum of only @xmath61 , consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the metal enrichment of an snr may still be localized even in a low density medium , unless an interaction with another snr or a global flow such as a galactic wind redistributes the ejecta .",
    "we have neglected the cooling effect . using the collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) cooling rate",
    ", we estimate the total radiative energy loss to be less than 5% up to 0.2 myr .",
    "the undisturbed ambient gas itself radiates even more efficiently than the swept - up gas by sn blastwave .",
    "the potential deviation from the assumed cie should be small , because the ambient medium considered here is already highly ionized .",
    "the above results show that the evolution of an snr in a low - density hot medium has several distinct properties : 1 ) the blastwave always moves at a speed greater than , or comparable to , the sound wave and can thus reach a much larger radius than that predicted by the sedov solution ; 2 ) because the remnant never gets into a snow - plow radiative phase , the radiative cooling is typically negligible ; 3 ) the swept - up thermal energy is important , affecting the evolution of both the blastwave and the interior structure ; 4 ) because the mach number of the blastwave is typically small , its heating is subtle and over a large volume .",
    "the large - scale distributed heating by such snrs may have strong implications for solving the energy balance problems in studying diffuse hot gas .",
    "the most notable problem is perhaps the apparent lack of predicted cooling flows in groups and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "various existing proposals for the solution ( e.g. , agn heating and thermal conduction ) have only limited success and many uncertainties .",
    "fundamentally , a distributed heating mechanism is required to balance the cooling ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , heating due to sound waves generated by buoyant bubbles from agn energy injections has recently been proposed as a solution @xcite . but none of these proposals are likely to explain the more acute over - cooling problem in individual galaxies , where the cooling time scale of hot gas is even shorter . as shown above , blastwaves produced by sne , type ia in particular , may provide a natural mechanism for the heating required to balance , or at least alleviate , the cooling of the diffuse hot gas around individual galaxies , possibly even in the igm @xcite .",
    "clearly , the above discussion is very much limited by our 1-d simulations of individual snrs .",
    "we are currently carrying out 3-d simulations to study the evolution of hot gas in galactic bulges .",
    "these simulations will account for the cooling as well as the spatial inhomogeneity generated by the global galactic gravity and by the interaction among multiple snrs .",
    "the spatial distribution and physical properties of the gas will then be determined self - consistently .    _",
