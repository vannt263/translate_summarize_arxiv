    "the application of the quantized hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite as resistance standard , and its importance for modern metrology , relies on the extremely high reproducibility ( better than @xmath1 ) of certain quantized resistance values .",
    "@xcite this extreme reproducibility points to an universal origin , which is independent on special material or sample properties .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to propose and evaluate a quasi - local transport model that allows us to calculate , first , the potential and current distribution in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2d es ) under the conditions of the qhe , and , second , the longitudinal and the hall resistance , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the plateau regimes of the qhe and in between . whereas the resistance values between the qh plateaus will depend on details of the used conductivity model , the exactly quantized plateau values result from the existence of sufficiently wide `` incompressible strips '' along which the local conductivity vanishes , since occupied and unoccupied states are separated by an energy gap ( landau quantization ) .",
    "localization assumptions,@xcite which played an important role in early approaches to the qhe , are not included in our model .",
    "our model is motivated by a recent experimental investigation of the hall - potential in a narrow hall bar , @xcite and a critical reexamination of a subsequent model calculation .",
    "@xcite    experimental information about the actual current and potential distribution in a hall bar under qhe conditions has been obtained recently by ahlswede and coworkers @xcite with a scanning force microscope @xcite .",
    "the data were interpreted in terms of `` incompressible strips '' with constant electron density ( corresponding to the filling of an integer number of landau levels ) , @xcite which are expected to develop in an inhomogeneous 2d es as a consequence of its strongly non - linear low - temperature screening properties @xcite in a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "if the filling factor in the center of the sample was slightly larger than an integer , the hall potential was found to drop completely across two strips , while being constant elsewhere . with decreasing @xmath0 , the strips moved towards the sample edges , just as one expects for the incompressible strips in a sample , in which the electron density decreases gradually from a maximum in the center towards the edges .",
    "if the center filling factor was slightly below an integer , a gradual potential variation was observed , either linear or a non - linear , without clear indication for incompressible strips.@xcite    this interpretation was supported by subsequent theoretical work of gven and gerhardts ( gg ) @xcite , who extended the self - consistent thomas - fermi - poisson approximation ( tfpa ) @xcite for the calculation of electron density profile and electrostatic potential to a non - equilibrium situation with a position - dependent electrochemical potential , determined by the presence of an applied dissipative current through the sample .",
    "electrochemical potential and current density was calculated from a local version of ohm s law , with a local model for the conductivity tensor , determined by the position - dependent electron density .",
    "the feed - back of the current distribution on electron density and the measurable potential profile @xcite was included by the assumption of local equilibrium in the stationary non - equilibrium situation .    in agreement with the experiment @xcite",
    ", the calculation @xcite shows a linear variation of the hall potential across the sample if there are no incompressible strips , e.g. for sufficiently high temperature or if the magnetic field is so strong , that the local filling factor is everywhere in the sample less than two ( spin - degeneracy is assumed and interactions which might lead to the fractional quantized hall effect are neglected ) . also for center",
    "filling factors slightly larger than 2 or 4 the calculation confirms the experiment , showing that the potential drops across broad incompressible strips and is constant elsewhere .",
    "however , due to the use of the tfpa , gg@xcite obtain incompressible strips whenever the center filling factor is larger than 2,@xcite and due to the strictly local conductivity model these dominate the current and potential distribution , and lead to vanishing longitudinal resistance .",
    "thus , the model assumptions of ref . lead to serious disagreement with important aspects of the experiment .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to improve on the model of gg@xcite so that , first , qualitative agreement between the calculated and the measured potential distribution is achieved for all filling factor regimes , and , second , reasonable results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are obtained . following the lines suggested by gg@xcite",

    "so we interpret the smearing - out of narrow incompressible strips in the hartree approximation as being due to the finite width of the wave functions .",
    "to check this idea , we consider a `` quasi - hartree '' approximation ( qha ) in which , instead of solving the problem of eq .",

    "it was shown that , in an local equilibrium picture , the changes of the electrostatic potential , caused by an applied current , follows closely the current - induced variation of the electro - chemical potential @xmath17 , so that the resulting density changes are small .",
    "in the present work we do not consider the feed - back of the spatial variation of @xmath17 on electrostatic potential and density profiles ( linear response ) .",

    "the normalization is chosen so that @xmath169 .",
    "one sees clearly that the plateaus of the quantized hall effect ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) coincide with potential variation of type iii , caused by current density confinement to the incompressible strips . moving from a plateau region to smaller @xmath0 values ,",
    "the incompressible strips shrink and finally vanish , and the current density spreads more and more out into the bulk .",
    "this leads to the type i behavior ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) . immediately above the integer values of the center filling factor ( in our approximation assuming spin degeneracy near @xmath174 and 4 ) , we find the rapid variation of the type ii .",
    "this is in very nice agreement with the experiment . without our spatial averaging of the conductivity tensor",
    ", we would have missed the type i regions for @xmath175 , as has been observed in ref .  .",
    "the virtue of our approach is , that it allows us to calculate resistance traces with exactly quantized quantum hall plateaus of finite width , and with reasonable values of the resistances between these plateaus . while these intermediate resistance values depend on the details of our conductivity model , the quantized plateau values do not .",
    "the reason for this high accuracy and model - independence of the plateau values is the fact , that the latter are determined by the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e0y ] ) and ( [ eq : v_h ] ) becoming singular across incompressible strips .    to obtain realistic widths of the qh plateaus",
    ", we had to consider a mechanism that prohibits singular current flow along very narrow incompressible strips .",
    "we have argued that small - scale non - local transport effects act into this direction , and that consideration of the finite extent of wavefunctions will prohibit arbitrarily narrow iss at low magnetic fields , in contrast to the prediction of the thomas - fermi approximation",
    ". we were able to simulate such non - local effects by a simple spatial averaging procedure , with reasonable results for hall and longitudinal resistance as functions of the magnetic field .",
    "also the resulting potential profile , and therefore the current distribution across the sample , is in nice agreement with recent investigations.@xcite we consider this as a strong support for the relevance of our approach , notably because earlier approaches , which neglected dissipation , can not explain the experiments , as has been discussed in ref .  .",
    "note that , for qh plateaus corresponding to filling factors @xmath176 , our results are qualitatively different form the conventional edge channel picture .",
    "the latter explains , for instance , the quantized conductance value @xmath177 as the sum of the contributions of two spin - degenerate , quasi - one - dimensional current channels near each of the opposite sample edges , thus tracing back the quantized hall effect to the phenomenon of 1d conductance quantization ( in a situation where no backscattering occurs ) .",
    "@xcite that is , the edge states , created by the lls with quantum numbers @xmath178 and @xmath179 , contribute both to the current in the plateau regime of the qhe .",
    "our results , on the contrary , indicate that the total current flows along the incompressible strip with local filling factor @xmath74 ( where both lls @xmath178 and @xmath179 are occupied ) , whereas near local filling factor @xmath69 no incompressible strip and no contribution to the current exists .    comparing our resistance curves with experiments ,",
    "we notice that the high - field edge of a calculated plateau occurs at a magnetic field , at which an incompressible strip ( with an even integer value of the effective filling factor @xmath86 ) first occurs in the center of the sample . in experiments",
    "these @xmath180 values usually are found somewhere near the centers of the plateaus .",
    "we have good arguments that this discrepancy is due to our neglect of long - range potential fluctuations due to the randomly distributed ionized donors .",
    "we have simulated the `` short - range '' part of the coulomb potentials of the remote donors by gaussian potentials , but we have neglected their overlapping long - range parts , which lead to long - range potential fluctuations .",
    "we have evaluated the short - range disorder within the scba to calculate conductivities and ll broadening .",
    "we have seen that with increasing disorder scattering the level broadening increases and , as a result , the widths of the qh plateaus shrinks . on the other hand",
    ", one knows from technical applications of the qh effect , that rather impure samples have usually especially wide and stable qh plateaus .",
    "this points to the role of long - range potential fluctuations , which become more important with increasing impurity concentration .    as a rough simulation of such long - range fluctuations",
    ", we have added oscillatory terms to the confinement potential and than repeated our calculations .",
    "we indeed find that such modulations can widen and stabilize the qh plateaus , and eventually even shift them to higher magnetic fields , depending on the amplitude , the range , and possible other details of the perturbation .",
    "this becomes understandable , if one considers the effect of such fluctuations on the existence and the position of incompressible strips .",
    "however , we do not want to discuss such considerations further , since we believe that our quasi - one - dimensional model is not appropriate for a reliable discussion of statistical fluctuations of a 2d donor distribution .",
    "effects of long - range disorder in an unconfined 2d es on the longitudinal resistance between qh plateaus have already been discussed a decade ago.@xcite this discussion seems however not applicable to the rather narrow samples of our present interest , since , first , the confinement affects the self - consistently calculated potential and thus the density distribution , @xcite and , second , the early assumptions about current - carrying and isolating regions are not compatible with our results and the experimental findings.@xcite    we gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with e.  ahlswede and j.  weis .",
