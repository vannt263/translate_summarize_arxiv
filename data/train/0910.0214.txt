    "the phenomenon of magnetism in hot , massive ob stars is not well studied . to date",
    ", repeated detections of circular polarization within line profiles have firmly established the presence of magnetic fields in three o - type stars ( @xmath10  ori  c , hd  191612 , and @xmath11  ori  a ; donati et al .",

    "indications of magnetic fields have also been reported in a number of other ob stars ( e.g. by hubrig et al .",
    "2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "such objects represent vital targets for the study of stellar magnetism .",
    "their strong , radiatively - driven winds couple to magnetic fields , generating complex and dynamic magnetospheric structures ( e.g. ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) , which modify mass loss , and may enhance the shedding of angular momentum via magnetic braking ( e.g. ud - doula et al .",
    "the presence of even a relatively weak magnetic field can profoundly influence the evolution of massive stars and their feedback effects , such as mechanical energy deposition in the ism and supernova explosions ( e.g. ekstrom et al .",
    "2008 ) . for these reasons , the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) large program ( wade et al . 2009 ; grunhut et al .",
    "2009 ) is exploiting the unique spectropolarimetric characteristics of espadons at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and narval at the t ' elescope bernard lyot ( tbl ) to obtain critical missing information about the poorly - studied magnetic properties of these important stars .",
    "one of the mimes targets is hd  57682 , an o9 sub - giant star .",
    "hd  57682 is reported to be a runaway star ( comeron et al .",
    "1998 ) with no known companions ( e.g. de wit et al . 2005 ; turner et al . 2008 ) and shows no photometric variability ( e.g. balona 1992 ) . however , hd  57682 exhibits variability of uv lines characteristic of magnetic ob stars ( e.g. schnerr et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this is the primary reason it was included in the mimes target list .",
    "eleven high - resolution ( @xmath12 ) , broadband ( 370 - 1050  nm ) circular polarization ( stokes  @xmath8 ) spectra of hd  57682 were obtained with the espadons spectropolarimeter , mounted on the 3.6-m cfht , as part of the survey component of the mimes large program .",
    "the spectra were acquired and reduced in a manner essentially identical to that described by silvester et al .",
    "the observations were obtained during two separate espadons runs .",
    "the first two observations were obtained on successive nights in 2008 dec .",
    "( high extinction hindered our first observation ) , and an additional 9 observations were obtained in 2009 may on five different nights . on nights when more than one observation was obtained , the un - normalised spectra were co - added prior to analysis , yielding 7 independent observations ; a 5@xmath13-order polynomial ( or lower ) was used for normalisation of each individual order .",
    "a complete summary of the espadons observations is given in table  [ obs_tab ] .",
    "least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ; donati et al .",
    "1997 ) was applied to all polarimetric observations in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for this analysis .",
    "we adopted a mask in which all the stark - broadened hydrogen and helium lines , and the metallic lines that are blended with the hydrogen lines were excluded .",
    "this resulted in approximately 165 relatively pure photospheric lines used for the creation of the mean , normalised stokes @xmath14 , @xmath8 , and diagnostic null ( @xmath15 ) profiles , yielding an increase in the stokes  @xmath8 s / n by a factor of @xmath167.5 .",

    "the longitudinal field measurements , which are reported in table  [ obs_tab ] , vary between -167  g and + 282  g , with a typical uncertainty of 20 - 40  g. while the longitudinal field provides a useful statistical measure of the line - of - sight component of the field , we stress that we do not use it as the primary diagnostic of the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is because a large variety of magnetic configurations can produce a null longitudinal field .",
    "however , nearly all of these configurations will generate a detectable stokes  @xmath8 signature in the velocity - resolved line profiles , which is what we observe .",

    "[ iue_var ] ) - a phenomenon that is not observed in other uv lines and occurs exclusively in magnetic b - type stars , e.g. @xmath11  cas ( neiner et al . 2003 ) and all magnetic he - strong stars",
    ". our cmfgen models are not able to reproduce this variability by increasing the mass - loss rate , which , as we show in sect .",
    "[ disc_sec ] , leads us to believe that it is due to magnetically - confined circumstellar material .    in order to determine the rotational velocity @xmath7 of hd  57682 we computed the fourier transform of many un - blended absorption lines throughout the optical spectrum ( e.g. gray 1981 )",
    "the results of our analysis suggest that there is an important non - rotational contribution to the line profile .",
    "our cmfgen models employed an additional 40  kms@xmath5 macro - turbulence to provide a better fit to the observed absorption lines . from the analysis of about 30 different lines from the 2008 dec . 6 and 2009",
    "may 4 observations , we infer a mean @xmath7 of about @xmath19  kms@xmath5 , in good agreement with balona ( 1992 ) .",
    "due to the limited temporal sampling of our observations , we are unable to unambiguously determine the rotational period of hd  57682 . however , using an upper limit on our inferred radius of 9.4  r@xmath20 and the inferred rotational broadening of 15  kms@xmath5 , we estimate that the maximum ( rigid ) rotation period @xmath21 is equal to about 31.5  d. the observed variations of h@xmath18 ( see fig .  [ temp_var ] ) are qualitatively consistent with such a period , because the night - to - night changes are small compared to the difference between the mean profile corresponding to the two different observing runs . as well",
    ", the variability of the stokes  @xmath8 profiles and longitudinal field measurements also support a variability timescale considerably longer than 5 nights .",
    "we therefore conclude that the variability of the magnetic and spectroscopic observables are consistent with rotational modulation , with a period of a few weeks .",
    "the longitudinal field measurements imply a strength of the dipole component of the magnetic field of at least 1  kg , consistent with the strengths of fossil fields studied in ap / bp stars , as well as other b and o - type stars .",
    "to estimate the surface magnetic field characteristics of hd  57682 , we used the same method as petit et al .",
    "( 2008 ; and in prep . ) , which compares the observed stokes  @xmath8 profiles to a large grid of synthetic profiles , described by an oblique - rotator model , to estimate the magnetic properties of the star",
    ". the model is parametrized by the dipole field strength @xmath22 , the rotation axis inclination @xmath23 , the positive magnetic axis obliquity @xmath24 , and the rotation phase @xmath25 . in order to compute synthetic stokes  @xmath8 profiles , we need to infer the line properties using the stokes  @xmath14 profile . as the detailed formation of the line profile and the source of its variation is uncertain , we opted for the simplest assumption and used the mean of the observed profiles to determine the intensity profile parameters .    assuming that only @xmath25 may change between different observations of a given star , the goodness - of - fit of a given rotation - independent ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) magnetic configuration can be computed to determine a configuration that provides the overall best likelihood for all the observed stokes  @xmath8 profiles . in fig .",
    "[ sv_fits ] , we compare the synthetic profiles of the overall best likelihood configuration ( in green ) with the best likelihood configuration for each observation ( in red ) .",
    "the quality of the different fits are similar , showing that a single inclined dipole can reproduce the observations as well as individual dipole configurations , although both are imperfect",
    ". however , any features that can not be explained are treated formally as additional noise .",
    "[ sv_fits ] shows the resulting marginalised _ a posteriori _ probability density function ( pdf ) for the dipole field strength ( bottom left ) .",
    "the inferred value for the magnetic surface field strength in the 68.3% credible region , is then @xmath26  g. the value of the dipole field strength will vary greatly with a small change of the inclination value , as illustrated in the @xmath22-@xmath23 2d pdf shown in fig .",
    "[ sv_fits ] ( top left )",
    ". a determination of the rotation period by further observations will improve the estimate of the dipole field strength .    based on these data ,",
    "the obliquity of the magnetic axis is closely correlated with the inclination as well , as demonstrated by the @xmath24-@xmath23 2d pdf shown in fig .",
    "[ sv_fits ] ( top right ) . according to the 99.7% credible regions of the marginalised pdfs of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ sv_fits ] in blue and red respectively ) , we infer that the obliquity is between @xmath27 and @xmath28 if the inclination is between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , or between @xmath31 and @xmath32 if the inclination is between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass - loss rate derived from the h@xmath18 profiles is inconsistent with mass - loss derived from the c  iv uv lines .",
    "test models indicate that the intensity of the h@xmath18 emission observed at different dates requires mass - loss rates above @xmath16@xmath35  m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 . with such high values , the predicted uv spectra would present strong p - cygni profiles ( e.g. marcolino et al . 2009 ) , which are not seen in any of the iue spectra available for hd  57682 .",
    "in fact , hd  57682 presents a uv spectrum typical of galactic weak wind stars , with no significant p - cygni emissions ( martins et al .",
    "2005b ; marcolino et al .",
    "this leads us to believe that the h@xmath18 profiles are not formed in the wind , but are possibly a result of confined circumstellar material .",
    "walborn ( 1980 ) already reported this line to be unusual and of non - nebular origin .",
    "a preliminary bayesian analysis suggests that the magnetic field of hd  57682 is approximately reproduced by a dipole field with a characteristic surface field strength of @xmath26  g. we computed the magnetic wind confinement parameter ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) @xmath36 for hd  57682 , using @xmath37  g , and the physical parameters listed in table  [ params ] ( @xmath38 ranges from @xmath39 - @xmath40 using the 99.7% credible regions ) .",
    "although strongly confined , this places hd  57682 at an interesting intermediate regime amongst ob stars , between the super - strongly - confined wind of @xmath41  ori  e ( @xmath42 ) and the much more weakly confined wind of @xmath10  ori  c ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "magnetic confinement of the wind of hd  57682 would naturally explain the h@xmath18 variability , the uv variability , and the line depth variability .",
    "moreover , shocks produced in a magnetically channelled wind could boost the x - ray emission , providing an explanation of the high x - ray luminosity without requiring a high mass - loss rate ( e.g. cohen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , it is puzzling that hd  57682 presented a soft x - ray spectrum during the rosat observations , contrary to what would be expected from a fast wind and the strong magnetic confinement .",
    "this discovery brings the number of firmly - established magnetic o - type stars to four . with its strong wind confinement , and its stellar and wind properties determined ,",
    "hd 57682 provides a testbed for future mhd simulations .",
    "however , more data are needed to better determine the surface dipole field strength , magnetic obliquity , and inclination .",
