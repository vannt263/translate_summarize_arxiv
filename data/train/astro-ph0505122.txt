    "a tremendous amount of gravitational energy is released when a massive galaxy forms , roughly @xmath14 erg from its billion supernova explosions and another @xmath14 erg during the assembly of its central @xmath15-@xmath16 black hole .",
    "although @xmath17% of the supernova energy is carried away by neutrinos , and a similar fraction of the black hole radiation escapes the galaxy , the remaining energy is enough to unbind most of the galaxy s gas .",
    "the fate of the galaxy depends on what happens to the energy .",
    "if it is absorbed by sufficiently dense gas , it will be converted into radiation by two - body processes and will stream harmlessly away ; but otherwise it will set in motion an enormous blast - wave analogous to those produced by nuclear explosions on earth .",
    "these blast - waves , tearing through galaxies , stripping away material , plowing outwards , and coming finally to rest in distant intergalactic space , are believed to have significantly altered the evolution of the baryonic universe .",
    "indirect evidence for their existence comes in two forms .",
    "first , if the gas near galaxies had not been heated by some source , disk galaxies would be smaller than they are ( weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) and the correlation between galaxy clusters x - ray temperature and luminosity would have the wrong shape ( kaiser 1991 ; ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "second , something quenches most galaxies star formation at some point in their history , and blast - waves seem the best candidate . without them",
    "small galaxies would be too numerous ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "1994 ) , big galaxies would be too blue ( springel , di matteo , & hernquist 2005 ) and too large a fraction of baryons would have been turned into stars ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 , springel & hernquist 2002 ) .    direct evidence remains elusive , however .",
    "although local star - forming galaxies are surrounded by outflowing gas ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; martin 2005 ) , typically their observable outflows extend to only a few kpc , far smaller than their virial radii .",
    "it is unclear how far these flows will advance before they stall or how severely they will affect the evolution of the galaxies and their surroundings .",
    "the presence of metals in the intergalactic medium might be taken as proof that the blast - waves spill out of some galaxies halos , but even that is controversial .",
    "intergalactic metals could also have been produced by the first generation of population iii stars or stripped from galaxies by other processes ( e.g. , gnedin 1998 ) .",
    "five years ago , our group began to search for direct evidence for large - scale outflows around galaxies at high redshift .",
    "high - redshift galaxies were attractive targets because they have larger star - formation rates and ( possibly ) shallower potentials than their nearby counterparts .",
    "in addition , the higher density of the universe in the past is a significant advantage , because it strengthens many of the absorption lines that can be used to detect intergalactic gas .",
    "we identified three observations that would qualify , in our view , as direct evidence for large - scale outflows : gas at large galactocentric radii moving outwards at greater than the escape velocity ; a strong association of intergalactic metals and galaxies ; and disturbances , near galaxies , to the lattice - work of intergalactic hi that pervades the high - redshift universe .",
    "we searched for this evidence by systematically mapping the relative spatial distributions of star - forming galaxies and intergalactic gas .",
    "early results were presented in adelberger et al .",
    "this paper is an update . after describing the current data in   [ sec : data ] , we review the status of our search .",
    "section  [ sec : pairs ] shows that the outflowing material responsible for the blue - shifted `` interstellar '' absorption lines in the galaxies spectra often lies at a radius of @xmath18@xmath19 proper kpc .",
    "weaker absorption lines extend out to radii approaching @xmath20 kpc .",
    "section  [ sec : r0gc ] describes the galaxy - civ cross - correlation function and reinforces the idea that detectable intergalactic metals tend to lie near actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec : gpe ] shows that most galaxies are surrounded by significant amounts of intergalactic hi but that galaxies with little nearby hi are significantly more common than would be expected in the absence of winds .",

    "light from the background galaxy passed within 17 proper kpc of the foreground galaxy as it traveled towards earth , and this was close enough for the foreground galaxy s absorption lines to be imprinted in its spectrum .",

    "in fact , as we will see below ( figure  [ fig : civhist ] ) , only about half of the galaxies within @xmath117 ( @xmath7 kpc ) are associated with civ absorption so strong .",

    "although two of their three galaxies with @xmath221 comoving mpc had redshifts that placed the nebular lines outside of atmospheric windows , the near - ir nebular redshift we obtained for the third confirmed the reported lack of nearby lyman-@xmath11 absorption .",
    "another possibility is that genuine evolution from @xmath222 to @xmath223 is partly responsible for the increased absorption near galaxies in this sample .",

    "although a number of explanations are possible , the data in figure  [ fig : compare_juna ] seem qualitatively consistent with the idea that the galaxies are surrounded by anisotropically expanding winds . leaking out along the paths of least resistance , these winds would turn moderate absorption into weak absorption while leaving the strongest absorption systems in place .",
    "ionizing radiation from any neighboring qsos might also preferentially eliminate weaker absorption systems . as figure  [ fig : check_gpegals ] shows ,",

    "there is no absorption line anywhere near the galaxy redshift , but in the remainder the galaxies could conceivably be associated with nearby absorption lines if redshift errors were somewhat larger than we estimate . reducing the number of galaxies with",
    "little nearby hi by 50% would begin to make our observations consistent with the predictions of windless sph simulations .",
    "second , 5 of the 9 galaxies lie within a single field , q1623 , which contains one of the largest known concentrations of qsos with @xmath26 .",
    "this is a consequence of the dense spectroscopic sampling we obtained in the field , but it raises the possibility that our result might have been different had we surveyed a more representative part of the universe .",
    "the spatial clustering strength of the high - redshift galaxies in this field is certainly not typical , for example ( adelberger et al .",
    "2005b ) .    even without its questionable statistical significance ,",
    "the apparent lack of hi near some galaxies would not have a straightforward interpretation .",
    "this is due to the complexity of the interaction between winds and galaxies inhomogeneous surroundings .",
    "analytic models treat this in an extremely crude way , and existing numerical simulations are unable to resolve either the shock fronts or the instabilities that result when the hot wind flows past cooler intergalactic material . as a result",
    "it is unclear if winds would destroy the hi near galaxies .",
    "other effects that simulations do not resolve ( e.g. , cooling instabilities ) might reduce the covering fraction of hi near galaxies .",
    "even if there were low - density regions near galaxies in sph simulations , they might not be recognized since the density is generally estimated by smoothing over the few dozen nearest particles , particles which ( by definition ) are likely to lie outside of any local underdensity .",
    "finally , photoionization could play some role .",
    "kollmeier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and adelberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the galaxies radiation can not destroy all the hi within @xmath12 comoving mpc without overproducing the uv background , but photoionizing the weaker clouds around one third of the galaxies might be possible .",
    "it therefore remains unclear if the lack of hi near some galaxies is a unique or even an expected signature of superwinds .",
    "the weak correlations between galaxy properties and the strength of nearby intergalactic hi absorption may suggest that the hi absorption is unrelated to winds .",
    "although our observations do not provide unequivocal evidence for superwinds at @xmath26 , it would be a mistake to conclude that they favor intergalactic metal enrichment at very high redshifts .",
    "in the few cases where the two scenarios have clearly different predictions ( e.g. , anisotropies in the galaxy - civ correlation function on small scales ) , the observations seem to favor lower - redshift enrichment . in addition",
    ", enrichment at very high redshifts seems implausible on other grounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : metals ] illustrates a major problem : stars that form before @xmath256 probably produce an inconsequential amount of metals compared to the stars that form afterward , so their metals could be dominant in the igm only if virtually no metals were able to escape into the igm at later times . in order for 90% of the intergalactic metals",
    "observed at @xmath222 to have been produced at @xmath269 , for example , supernovae ejecta would have to be at least 100 times more likely to escape their galaxy at @xmath270 than at @xmath261 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the total intergalactic metal density at @xmath223 , @xmath271 for @xmath272 and @xmath273 ( schaye et al . 2003 ) , would be roughly twice the total metal production at @xmath274 and five times smaller than the metal production at @xmath275 if the cosmic star - formation density were roughly constant for @xmath276 , the stellar density at @xmath223 were @xmath277 ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath278 of star formation produced @xmath279 of metals .",
    "is the metal escape fraction likely to be 100 times larger at @xmath256 than @xmath222 ?",
    "two factors are commonly thought to increase the likelihood of escape at high redshift : galaxies are less massive and the intergalactic medium lies closer to them than at later times when the universe has expanded more . both are offset by competing effects , however , and it is not clear to us that very high redshift galaxies have much of an advantage at all .",
    "first consider the galaxy masses .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of a galaxy scales as @xmath280 , or @xmath281 , while the energy released by a galaxy s supernovae scales as @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the efficiency of star formation .",
    "if @xmath283 were independent of @xmath284 , smaller galaxies would be more easily unbound by supernova explosions .",
    "this is the standard assumption , but in fact @xmath283 increases with @xmath284 and the situation is not clear cut .",
    "for example , compare the star - formation efficiencies of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath222 to those of galaxies at @xmath256 .",
    "the ratio of stellar to baryonic mass for lyman - break galaxies at @xmath222 is @xmath285 ( adelberger et al .",
    "2004 ) , which implies @xmath286 .",
    "an upper limit to the star - formation efficiency at @xmath270 can be derived by assuming that the star - formation density is constant for @xmath276 .",
    "( in fact it appears to be significantly lower at @xmath287 ; bunker et al . 2004 . ) in this case the stellar density at @xmath270 will be @xmath288 , scaling from the @xmath223 stellar density estimated by dickinson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and rudnick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while the fraction of baryons in the halos with @xmath289 km s@xmath3 that are able to host star formation ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2004 ) is @xmath290 .",
    "that implies an upper limit to the star - formation efficiency of @xmath291 for typical galaxies at @xmath256 .",
    "the order - of - magnitude increase in star - formation efficiency at lower redshift removes any advantage higher - redshift galaxies might gain from their smaller masses .",
    "a similar argument shows that the star - formation efficiencies of lbgs are far higher than those of smaller galaxies at similar redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "now consider the supposed benefit from the small size of the universe at @xmath256 .",
    "if supernova ejecta at @xmath256 extended from their galaxies into the receding hubble flow , their filling fraction at lower redshift would be boosted by the subsequent expansion of the universe .",
    "in fact , however , the ejecta will not normally reach the hubble flow .",
    "instead they are likely to be swept back into their galaxy by the ongoing process of structure formation .",
    "to illustrate the point , we show in figure  [ fig : haloneighbors ] the distance to the nearest halo of mass @xmath292 at @xmath293 for every particle in the gif - lcdm simulation ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ) that lay within @xmath12 comoving mpc of a galaxy ( i.e. , halo ) at @xmath270 or @xmath294 .",
    "the result is stark : the overwhelming majority of these particles end up inside the virial radius of a galaxy at @xmath223 . since the stalled ejecta of galaxies at @xmath270 or @xmath294",
    "will be swept along by the movements of the material that surrounds the galaxies , they should largely end up inside galaxies at @xmath223 as well .",
    "this exercise may be slightly misleading , since the gif - lcdm simulation only resolves halos of mass @xmath295 ( i.e. , @xmath296 fluctuations at @xmath256 ) , not the smaller halos believed to be most responsible for polluting the igm at @xmath256 .",
    "however , a simple calculation shows that a significant fraction of the metals from the lower - mass progenitors should also end up inside galaxies at @xmath223 .",
    "the estimated stalling radius for winds from small galaxies at @xmath256 is @xmath297 comoving kpc ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is the lagrangian radius for a halo of mass @xmath298 .",
    "if these galaxies typical descendants at @xmath223 have masses significantly larger than this , the metals will likely have been swept inside them . according to the extended press - schechter formalism , @xmath299% of the galaxies at @xmath300 that descended from @xmath228 fluctuations at @xmath270 will have masses that exceed this threshold by an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , equation 2.16 of lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the metals produced at @xmath269 should therefore be locked inside galaxies by @xmath223 . once there , some of them are likely to cool further , fall towards the center , and disappear from view . since the total metal production at @xmath269 is at best comparable to the observed metal content of the igm at @xmath223 ( figure  [ fig : metals ] ) , this suggests that the intergalactic metallicity at @xmath223 must receive a significant contribution from some other source .",
    "a corollary is that the metal content of the igm would drain into galaxies and _ decrease _ over time if it were not continually replenished .",
    "the observed constancy of the igm metallicity ( e.g. , schaye et al . 2003 ) therefore also seems to require metals to escape from galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "( e.g. , schaye et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the removal of this assumption seems dubious to us , however .",
    "metals could exist in parts of the igm that were never near galaxies only if they were produced by population iii stars , presumably , and the amount of population iii star formation would have to be inordinately large to match the observed intergalactic metallicity at @xmath301 ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : metals ] ; see also aguirre et al .",
    "we reviewed the status of our search for direct evidence of large - scale outflows around uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "these are our principal observations :    @xmath302 the gas that lies within 40kpc of lbgs produces extremely strong absorption lines ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) in the spectra of background galaxies and qsos ( figure  [ fig : specsum ] ) .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the civ absorption in low - resolution spectra imply that the absorbing material has range of velocities of at least @xmath303 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the absorption produced by this gas is similar to the interstellar absorption seen in lbgs spectra , suggesting the lbgs outflowing `` interstellar '' gas may actually lie at radii approaching 40kpc .",
    "@xmath302 for roughly half of the lbgs , civ absorption lines with column density @xmath304 @xmath5 are observed out to impact parameters of @xmath7 kpc ( figures  [ fig : specsum ] and  [ fig : civhist ] ) .",
    "this implies that roughly one - third of all `` intergalactic '' absorption lines with @xmath131 @xmath5 are produced by gas that lies within @xmath7 kpc of an lbg .",
    "galaxies too faint to satisfy our selection criteria could easily account for the remainder . in some cases",
    "the absorbing gas has substructure on half - kpc scales ( figure  [ fig : smallscalestructure ] ) .",
    "@xmath302 the cross - correlation function of galaxies and civ systems with @xmath9 @xmath5 appears to be the same as the correlation function of galaxies ( figure  [ fig : r0gc_vs_nciv ] ) .",
    "this implies that civ systems and galaxies reside in similar parts of the universe and is consistent with the idea that they are largely the same objects .",
    "we also find a strong association of ovi systems with galaxies ( figure  [ fig : q1700metals ] ) . on small scales",
    "the redshift - space cross - correlation function is highly anisotropic ( figure  [ fig : civ_nirspec_xigc ] ) .",
    "the metal - enriched gas must therefore have large velocities relative to nearby galaxies .",
    "the required velocities appear to exceed the galaxies velocity dispersions but are similar to the galaxies observed outflow speeds .",
    "@xmath302 in contradiction to the earlier result of adelberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find that the gas within @xmath12 comoving mpc of lbgs usually produces strong ly-@xmath11 absorption in the spectra of background galaxies ( figure  [ fig : fbar_vs_r ] ) . the absorption is weak ( mean transmitted flux within @xmath12 mpc of @xmath246 ) in only about one case out of three ( figure  [ fig : compare_juna ] ) .",
    "even so , the weakness of the absorption in these cases remains difficult to understand . since",
    "high - redshift galaxies reside in dense parts of the universe , with large amounts of hydrogen and short recombination times , one would expect them to be surrounded by large amounts of hi . the hi has presumably collapsed into clouds and sightlines to the background qsos might occasionally miss every cloud near a galaxy , but the sph simulations of kollmeier et al .",
    "( in preparation ) suggest that the chance of this is very low ( figure  [ fig : compare_juna ] ) .",
    "@xmath302 we were unable to identify any statistically significant differences in age , dust reddening , stellar mass , kinematics , or environment between galaxies with weak nearby hi absorption and the rest , although galaxies with weak absorption may have higher star - formation rates ( figure  [ fig : fluxgpegals ] ) .",
    "galaxies near intergalactic civ systems appear to reside in relatively dense environments ( figure  [ fig : compare_densities ] ) and to have distinctive seds characterized by blue colors and young ages ( figure  [ fig : civgpegals ] ) .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , none of these observations provide unequivocal evidence for superwinds at @xmath2233 .",
    "this is mostly because it is unclear how superwinds would affect the correlation between galaxies and intergalactic absorption lines .",
    "metals and galaxies would lie near each other at @xmath222 even if there were no active outflows , for example .",
    "we argued in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] that star - formation at @xmath274 may not produce enough metals to account for the intergalactic metallicity at @xmath2233 , and that many of these metals would be buried inside galaxies by @xmath2233 , but our simple arguments need to be checked with numerical simulations .",
    "the interpretation of our data will remain ambiguous until that time .",
    "the arguments presented in   [ sec : discussion ] should make it clear that metal enrichment at @xmath305 will be much harder to rule out than metal enrichment at @xmath269 .",
    "there is only one case where the data seem easy to interpret and we are limited by the small size of our sample .",
    "this is the redshift - space distribution of metals within @xmath306 comoving kpc of galaxies .",
    "mapping the velocity offsets between galaxies stars and their metals as a function of impact parameter would help show if the detected metals are flowing out of , falling into , or orbiting within the galaxies halos .",
    "the velocity offsets can be mapped by obtaining higher resolution spectra of more close pairs ( e.g. , the right panel of figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) or by obtaining more near - ir nebular redshifts for galaxies near the qso sightline ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : civ_nirspec_xigc ] ) .",
