    "experimental realization of atomic bose - einstein condensation and degenerated fermi gases , has stimulated a large interest in the physics of ultracold gases @xcite . among others ,",
    "the issue of fluctuations in the number of condensed atoms has been a subject of intensive theoretical studies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the standard textbook approach based on the grand - canonical ensemble predicts unphysically large fluctuations .",
    "this pathological behavior is avoided , however , when one employs the canonical or the microcanonical ensemble , where the total number of particles is fixed . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "trapped atoms are under conditions of almost complete isolation .",
    "this favors the use of microcanonical ensemble , at least in the situations when predictions of different statistical ensembles are not equivalent .",
    "while in ideal gases the microcanonical fluctuations have been thoroughly investigated @xcite-@xcite , the corresponding problem for interacting gases has been only studied in the first - order perturbation theory @xcite , or for relatively small systems by means of numerical methods @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bogoliubov theory @xcite , which has proved to be immensely successful to describe weakly interacting gases , has been applied to study the fluctuations in the canonical ensemble @xcite , but to our best knowledge , it was not used to investigate the microcanonical fluctuations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the problem of microcanonical fluctuations in the framework of bogoliubov theory . for a homogeneous system",
    "we perform our analysis within the particle - number - conserving formulation of the bogoliubov theory , developed by girardeau and arnowitt @xcite . in this way",
    "we avoid the possible errors resulting from the nonconservation of the number of particles in the bogoliubov method .",
    "we obtain that the microcanonical fluctuations , similarly to the canonical ones @xcite , exhibit anomalous scaling with the total number of particles .",
    "moreover , fluctuations in the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble differ by an extensive quantity , and predictions of both ensembles become equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . for a homogeneous system",
    "this feature is already observed for an ideal gas .",
    "nevertheless , in a harmonic trap , the microcanonical fluctuations of noninteracting condensate remain different from the canonical ones even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we show here , that inclusion of weak interactions described in terms of bogoliubov theory , restores the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical description , and gives rise to the anomalous scaling of fluctuations in both considered ensembles .",
    "noteworthy , for a homogeneous system we observe that application of the particle - number - conserving method leads to the similar results as obtained from the standard , nonconserving approach .",
    "therefore , for a trapped gas we carry out our derivations only within the nonconserving theory , which we find more convenient in this case .",
    "we discuss this issue in the last section explaining why at low temperatures the fluctuations are insensitive to the actual number of atoms .",
    "the anomalous scaling of the fluctuations predicted by the bogoliubov theory is closely related with the existence of phonon excitations at low energies . on the contrary ,",
    "application of the first - order perturbation theory results in the normal scaling of the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "while the perturbative treatment is more appropriate for finite size systems with sufficiently small interactions , in the thermodynamic limit the system should be rather described within the bogoliubov theory , since the presence of arbitrary small interactions leads to the phonon excitations at low energies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we note that there is some controversy on using the bogoliubov method to calculate the quantities higher than the second order in the field operators @xcite .",
    "an excellent agreement of the bogoliubov theory with the exact statistics calculated for the one dimensional trapped gas @xcite provides , however , strong arguments in favor of the bogoliubov approach . the ultimate test of the theoretical predictions should be provided by experiments , either through the measurement of the second - order correlation functions , or by detecting the statistics of scattered photons @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : idealgas ] , for the sake of completeness , we analyze the fluctuations of ideal bose gases confined in a three dimensional box and a harmonic trap . the behavior of fluctuations in an interacting gas confined in a three dimensional box is studied in section [ sec : intgas ] . in particular , in section",

    "the condensate serves as an infinite reservoir of particles for the subsystem of excited states .",

    "in this section we calculate the canonical fluctuations of a weakly interacting gas confined in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap of frequency @xmath40 . for a homogeneous system we have demonstrated that the particle - number - conserving approach leads to the same value of fluctuations as the traditional , nonconserving bogoliubov method .",
    "since the trapped gas is more complicated to treat analytically , in the following we apply the standard bogoliubov theory generalized for an inhomogeneous system , limiting our analysis to the leading order behavior in the thermodynamic limit . similarly to the homogeneous case we restrict our considerations to the temperatures much smaller than the critical temperature , neglecting the influence of the thermal depletion on the excitation spectrum .",
    "in addition , we assume the dilute - gas regime , which allows to neglect the effects of the quantum depletion .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the number of atoms is sufficiently large : @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the harmonic oscillator length , and the condensate can be described in the _ thomas - fermi _ ( tf ) regime .",
    "this is particularly convenient since in this regime the analytic solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations are known @xcite .    in the bogoliubov theory the field operator is decomposed into the condensate wave function @xmath187 and the noncondensed part @xmath188 : @xmath189 .",
    "the approximate hamiltonian with neglected third- and fourth - order terms in @xmath188 is diagonalized by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 are the creation and annihilation operators of the elementary excitations , while the amplitudes @xmath193 , @xmath194 are solutions of the bogoliubov - de  gennes equations . in the tf regime , the condensate density has typical `` inverted parabola '' shape with the condensate wave function @xmath195 , which vanishes outside the condensate radius @xmath196 .",

    "we calculate the fluctuations substituting the operator of the number of noncondensed particles @xmath216 into @xmath217 .",

    "we observe that in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath232  _ const _ ) the fluctuations exhibit anomalous scaling , similarly to the behavior in a homogeneous system .",
    "moreover , the @xmath233 temperature dependence of fluctuations becomes universal , both for the homogeneous and trapped gases .      to calculate the microcanonical fluctuations in a trapped gas we employ the thermodynamic relation ( [ relfl ] ) . in section [ sec : fluctmc ] we have shown that this identity applies also to an interacting gas .",
    "the proof is quite general , and in the case of a trapped gas the only difference with respect to the homogeneous system is the form of the operators @xmath234 and @xmath97 , that enter the definition of @xmath84 and @xmath150 .    according to eqs .",
    "( [ dnde ] ) and ( [ d2e ] ) , the particle - energy correlation and the fluctuations of the system s energy , can be directly calculated from the mean number of noncondensed particles and the mean energy .",
    "the former quantity can be evaluated as the expectation value of the operator @xmath216 , where in place of @xmath235 we substitute decomposition ( [ bogtransf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath236 we use the approximation @xmath215 , obtaining the following result @xmath237 where @xmath238 stands for the quantum depletion .",
    "since @xmath238 does not depend on the temperature , its exact value is not important for the subsequent derivation .",
    "now , we utilize the results of appendix  [ appoverlap ] for the overlap integral between the amplitudes @xmath201 , and replace the summation by integration , which is valid in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath239 a similar method can not be applied , however , to calculate the mean energy of a weakly interacting trapped gas . in this case",
    "main contribution comes from the boundary of the condensate , where the excitations have single - particle character .",
    "derivation based on the semiclassical formulation of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory , which includes the effects of collective modes inside , and the single - particle excitations outside the condensate , yields the following law @xcite @xmath240 now , with the help of results ( [ netrap ] ) and ( [ etrap ] ) we calculate the difference between the fluctuations in the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble : @xmath241 it is easy to observe that the difference is proportional to @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore the microcanonical fluctuations , similarly to the canonical ones , are anomalous , and in the thermodynamic limit predictions of both ensembles become equivalent .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the fluctuations of the number of condensed particles in a weakly interacting homogeneous and trapped bose gases . for a homogeneous system",
    "we apply the particle - number - conserving formulation of the bogoliubov theory , and obtain the analytical results for the fluctuations in the canonical and microcanonical ensemble , including the corrections due to the finite size of the system .",
    "our derivation is based on contour integral representation in terms of spectral zeta function .",
    "we determine the poles of zeta functions resulting from the bogoliubov spectrum , and develop their asymptotic expansions .",
    "this allows us to find analytical formulas for the mean number of noncondensed particles , its fluctuations and the mean energy , which are valid for arbitrary ratio of the temperature to the chemical potential .",
    "we determine the microcanonical fluctuations from the thermodynamic identity which relates them to the quantities calculated in the canonical ensemble .",
    "our analysis shows that both the microcanonical and canonical fluctuations exhibit anomalous scaling , and in the thermodynamic limit fluctuations in these two ensembles become equal .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for a trapped gas . in this case",
    "we carry out our calculations within the standard bogoliubov theory , and evaluate only the leading order behavior in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results have been derived in the regime of temperatures much lower than the critical temperature , where the effects of the quantum and thermal depletion on the population of the condensate can be neglected .",
    "we stress , however , that generalization of the obtained results for the case of higher temperatures , can be done in straightforward way in the spirit of popov theory @xcite . to this end , for a homogeneous system parameter @xmath114 should be replaced by @xmath242 , with the density of condensed atoms @xmath243 determined in a self - consistent way from the equation for the mean number of noncondensed particles . in a similar way one can generalize the results for the trapped gas . in this case",
    "the total number of particles @xmath0 in equation for @xmath244 should be replaced by the number of condensed atoms @xmath245 , with @xmath245 calculated in a self - consistent a manner .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the application of the particle - number - conserving method to calculate the fluctuations . for a homogeneous system",
    "we have verified that both conserving and nonconserving theories lead to the identical results .",
    "such insensibility of the condensate statistics , can be attributed to the fact , that below the critical temperature , the condensate acts as a reservoir of particles for the noncondensed states .",
    "thus , as long as the temperature is not too close to the critical temperature , the probability distribution of the number of noncondensed atoms remains insensitive to the actual number of atoms .",
    "the total number of atoms influences only the energy spectrum in the interacting gas .",
    "therefore , predictions of conserving and nonconserving theories are the same with respect to the statistics of noncondensed part of the system .",

    "since @xmath250 , in the regime @xmath249 we can apply the binomial expansion @xmath251 substituting this expansion into ( [ apptheta1 ] ) , and interchanging the order of summation , we arrive at the following series representation for @xmath113 @xmath252 where @xmath253 denote epstein zeta function .",
    "since the singularities of @xmath254 in the numerator occur exactly at the same points as the singularities of @xmath255 in the denominator , the only poles in the series ( [ apptheta2 ] ) , are the ones of @xmath253 .",
    "epstein zeta function @xmath256 has only single pole at @xmath257 , with residue equal to @xmath24 .",

    "when @xmath282 becomes comparable to @xmath114 the integrand starts to grow , and finally becomes infinite for @xmath283 .",
