    "the proposal and experimental realizations of new ultra - fast molecular imaging techniques based on electron dynamics in intense ultra - short laser pulses have been the subject of intense research activity in the last decade@xcite . due to the ability they offer to visualize , at the atomic scale , the ultrafast molecular dynamics taking place in a chemical reaction or during an internal rearrangement process",
    ", these techniques obviously will find many applications in biological , chemical and material sciences .",
    "conventional methods used to achieve atomic resolution , for example x - ray or electron diffraction , are much more limited in time resolution than ultrafast electron - dynamics based imaging techniques .",
    "one of those new imaging approaches consists of probing a molecule by its own electrons , strongly driven and ionized by an intense laser pulse@xcite .",
    "this idea originates from the so - called three - step electron rescattering mechanism@xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that , during strong - field atomic or molecular ionization by an optical field , a free electronic wave packet is formed each time the laser field passes its maximum value .",
    "these wave packets , initially accelerated by the field , have a large probability to return to the vicinity of the parent ion when the electric field reverses its sign , half a cycle later .",
    "this creates a series of recollision processes , taking place with very high electron kinetic energies .",
    "the consequences of these electron - ion rescattering events are diverse and can lead to several different physical processes : elastic scattering of the returning electron , electronic excitation of the parent ion , non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , but also recombination of the recolliding electron with the orbital from which it was extracted , thus producing high order harmonics ( hhg ) .    using a few - cycle laser pulse ,",
    "the measurement of the outcome of the electron - ion rescattering events , which take place only half an optical cycle after ionization , can be seen as an ultra - fast probe of the molecule by its own electrons .",
    "it has for instance been realized that the high order harmonic spectrum carries very precise informations on the molecular structure and dynamics@xcite , with exceptional temporal and spatial resolutions .",
    "the harmonic spectrum is indeed related to the transition dipole between the ground and continuum electronic states . assuming a simple form for the continuum wave functions allows one to reconstruct the molecular ground state from a complete measurement of the harmonic phases and amplitudes .",
    "this method was proposed and used for the first time in 2004 by the group of p. b. corkum for the accurate experimental reconstruction of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of n@xmath0@xcite .",
    "even though the assumptions made in such a reconstruction method are still a matter of debate , this experimental breakthrough has generated a wealth of promising new theoretical and experimental studies@xcite .",
    "for instance , the intensity modulation of the harmonic spectra generated by aligned linear molecules was shown to be related to a multi - center molecular interference which can be used to measure the internuclear separation in the molecule@xcite .",
    "it should however be mentioned that the measured harmonic spectrum may be rather complex since it carries informations not only on the homo orbital , but also on lower lying orbitals ( , @xmath1 ) , which , depending on the molecule itself and on its orientation , may contribute significantly or not to the hhg spectrum@xcite .",
    "elastically scattered electrons also carry structural informations on the molecule , since their momentum distribution can be influenced by interferences between the amplitudes arising from the different scattering centers constituted by the nuclei .",
    "this imaging technique , first proposed in 1996 by t. zuo , a. d. bandrauk and p. b. corkum , was called `` _ _ laser - induced electron diffraction _ _ '' ( lied)@xcite .",
    "this proposal was investigated theoretically by different groups@xcite .",
    "it was first shown in restricted two - dimensional quantum simulations that clear signatures of two - center interferences could be distinguished in the re - scattered electron angular distributions@xcite .",
    "other investigations analyzed how these interferences could be used to image the structure of small molecules@xcite .",
    "this question was then addressed in full three - dimensional quantum simulations , and a relatively simple analytic transformations was proposed to extract the internuclear separation of a diatomic molecule from the full three - dimensional electron momentum distribution@xcite .",
    "the first successful experimental demonstration of lied was finally reported in 2008 from aligned o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 diatomic gases@xcite .",
    "contrarily to conventional electron diffraction , the ability to extract structural information from the outcome of a rescattering event , be it harmonic generation or laser - induced electron diffraction , relies heavily on the ability to align the molecule in the laboratory frame . assuming a realistic molecular alignment , we have recently demonstrated an accurate , simple and robust method to extract the molecular structure from the photo - electron spectra of a laser - driven linear , symmetric , polyatomic molecule@xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the detailed structure of the diffraction image reflects the symmetry of the molecular orbital from which the recolliding electron emanates .",
    "the present paper gives a more detailed theoretical analysis of this effect , illustrated first on the diatomic n@xmath0 molecule then on the triatomic co@xmath0 molecule , one of the simplest linear polyatomic system .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "the physical process of laser - induced electron diffraction is described in sec .",
    "our two - dimensional effective quantum model and the optimization of the model parameters are presented in sec .",
    "this section also presents results of our simulations on n@xmath0 , taken as an illustrative example of a model diatomic molecule , together with a number of assumptions leading to a simplified treatment of the electronic diffraction dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present our theoretical predictions and analysis of the electron momentum distribution for the triatomic molecule co@xmath0 .",
    "the spectra obtained with the three highest molecular orbitals are successively discussed , and the influence of various model assumptions are then presented .",
    "we conclude the work with a summary of our findings in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we start with a brief review of the so - called three - step mechanism , the principal idea from which the above dynamical molecular imaging schemes originate .",
    "figure[fig1 ] , inspired from the work of p. b. corkum and f. krauss@xcite , depicts the electron motion occurring in the combined oscillating force of an external laser field and that deriving from its binding potential , the latter being chosen as the double - well coulomb potential of a laser driven diatomic molecule , n@xmath0 for instance .",

    "the coordinate system @xmath4 refers to the plane defined by the molecular axis and the polarization vector @xmath5 of the linearly polarized electric field .",
    "the molecule is assumed to be initially aligned along the laboratory @xmath6-axis , while the intense laser pulse , which drives the electron dynamics , is polarized along the laboratory @xmath7-axis , as illustrated in the first row of fig.[fig1 ] . due to the form of the radiative interaction ,",
    "the subsequent electronic dynamics takes place essentially in the @xmath4-plane .",
    "also illustrated in the first row of fig.[fig1 ] is a single - cycle laser pulse defined as @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the period of the field .",

    "the middle panels of fig.[fig1 ] display , for specific times within the optical cycle , the total double - well coulomb potential distorted by the radiative interaction potential @xmath16 , written in the length gauge , @xmath17 being an electron coordinate .",
    "in addition to the potential surfaces , the electron motion is schematically indicated by classical trajectory - style representations .",
    "panels ( a ) to ( d ) refer to the different times indicated by the labeled dots placed on the electric - field waveform on the first row of the figure .",
    "panel ( a ) is for @xmath18 and corresponds to the field - free coulomb potential .",
    "panel ( b ) is for @xmath19 , a time close to the field peak intensity .",
    "the total coulomb plus field interaction potential is then characterized by a maximum positive slope .",
    "the molecule is ionized around that time , when the electric field amplitude is sufficiently high to lower the potential barrier allowing tunnel ionization .",
    "the positive electric field then accelerates the electron in the `` forward '' direction , @xmath20 . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the electric field changes its sign and so does the force on the electron , which is accelerated from then on in the opposite direction @xmath22 .",
    "the potential slope is then negative and the electron trajectory is classically accelerated back to the double - well region .",
    "the wave packet still extends in the forward direction until some time later , @xmath23 , panel ( c ) when the absolute value of the slope of the potential reaches its maximum .",
    "this is the classical turning point of the electron trajectory .",
    "panel ( d ) , for @xmath24 , illustrates the subsequent recollision process of the electron with the nuclei .",
    "the trajectories starting around @xmath25 lead to the most energetic recollision events@xcite .",
    "the system has thus produced its own electron gun .",
    "in addition to this , at times close to @xmath26 , the field is again large enough to significantly lower the potential energy barrier through which tunnel ionization could occur .",
    "there is then a possibility for a second electronic wave packet to be launched and accelerated in the backward direction . finally , it is important to note the asymmetry of the forward and backward scattering .",
    "the electron wave packet launched at a time close to @xmath27 is accelerated in the forward direction from the time of its birth and until it starts to return to the core .",
    "this oscillating wave packet interferes with a second wave packet produced around @xmath28 .",
    "this explains the observation of interference patterns in the backward direction @xmath29 in the lower rows of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a wealth of complex phenomena are induced by the recollision process in this three - step mechanism@xcite depicted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "indeed , the recollision may result - through the temporary recapture of the electron - in the formation of a transient excited species @xmath30^*$ ] leading to several possible decay channels .",
    "one of them corresponds to the definite recapture of the electron with the emission of high order harmonics ( hhg ) currently exploited in the generation of attosecond pulses@xcite .",
    "another possible process is non - sequential double - ionization ( nsdi)@xcite .",
    "yet another possibility , which is the subject of this paper is laser induced electron diffraction ( lied)@xcite , yielding a re - scattered electron with high momentum @xmath31 . it has also been observed that the recollision process may even leave the electron in highly excited rydberg states , as the ionized electron , being decelerated over many laser cycles , may be recaptured when the field is over .",
    "this last process has been called `` _ _ frustrated tunnel ionization__''@xcite .",

    "the aim is to show how lied can be used as a nuclear geometry imaging technique , and to establish a reliable procedure to retrieve geometrical informations from the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "we will refer to this procedure as an inversion algorithm .",
    "the laser - driven electron dynamics and the photoelectron spectra are calculated using a number of simplifying assumptions . these fall roughly into two classes : those pertaining to the model of the physical system itself , and those relevant to questions of experimental feasibility .",
    "the two assumptions that may be of most experimental concern are the hypothesis of a perfect molecular alignment and that of a few cycle pulse excitation . as will be shown later , the default to alignment is a major limitation for the quality requirements of the imaging technique . indeed , different alignment angles with respect to the polarization vector lead to different diffraction patterns , and we will have to assess the robustness of the results of our lied analysis with respect to misalignment of the molecule .",
    "another experimental challenge is the production of few - cycle laser pulses .",
    "we started out with observations made with a single - cycle pulse , for which the lied is most transparent .",
    "the inclusion of several cycles will induce complicated diffraction patterns due to several back and forth oscillations of the electronic wave packet along with multiple recollision events .",
    "one can expect , in a near future , more sophisticated molecular alignment techniques , on one hand , and the production of intense near single - cycle pulses , on the other hand .",
    "how the contrast of lied images is affected by the lack of perfect alignment and the effect of multi - cycle pulses on the diffraction spectra will however be discussed in detail in the second part of this article and illustrated explicitly for the case of the co@xmath0 molecule .    as to the model used for the physical ( molecular ) systems , the major limitation is the restricted number of degrees of freedom for the description at two levels : first , concerning nuclear degrees of freedom , a fixed nuclei approximation is used and the nuclear vibrational and rotational dynamics are completely neglected .",
    "this is justified by the ultrafast time scale of the electronic lied motion ( attosecond range ) as compared to the vibrational and rotational time scales ( femtosecond to picosecond range ) .",

    "a possible limitation of this technique seems to be the small numbers of fringes in the spectra , which may render more difficult the measurement of the geometrical structure for short internuclear separations .",
    "this limitation can however be overcome by changing the laser parameters , such as to increase the ponderomotive energy @xmath114 and consequently the radius of the ponderomotive motion circle @xmath102 to encircle a larger area covered by recolliding trajectories . for a given frequency ,",

    "the double peak structure of the [ fig.[fig7](b ) ] reflects also the 3-centered lcao structure of this orbital .",
    "this qualitative aspect of the inversion algorithm distinguishes it from previous , existing lied analysis approaches , and is the feature that depends most on the alignment condition as it is deeply rooted in the structure and symmetry of the molecular system .",
    "we turn next to the role and importance of the model assumptions , and assess the robustness of this lied analysis , as an imaging technique for the retrieval of geometrical information , with respect to the variations in the model parameters .",
    "this is conducted by examining separately those concerning molecular degrees of freedom and the ones in relation with the laser field .",
    "it is useful to make here a distinction between internal and external molecular degrees of freedom when referring to the various assumptions made above .",
    "assumptions on internal degrees of freedom are those made in describing electronic and vibrational dynamics .",
    "assumptions on external degrees of freedom are those concerning the rotational dynamics .",
    "let us examine the consequences of these approximations successively .      within the framework of the sae approximation",
    ", we have considered the ionization and the subsequent electronic dynamics to start from one of the highest occupied orbitals of the co@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the resulting spectra for the homo-@xmath62 ( @xmath176 , 1 , 2 ) gathered in fig.[fig7 ] show that : ( _ i _ ) very sharp minima at the momenta @xmath89 are predicted by the inversion algorithm from which the value of the c - o bond length @xmath96 can be obtained .",
    "more precisely , from the spectra shown in the figure , one obtains @xmath177  with an error of less than 3% over 8 peaks , when compared with the input parameter @xmath178 .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the observation of a periodic sequence of minima is clearest in the high energy region of the spectra , which incidentally corresponds mainly to backward scattering .    without relaxing yet the sae approximation ,",
    "we have also shown in panel ( d ) of fig.[fig7 ] how an incoherent superposition of the three homos with equal probability still results in a spectrum with sharply defined minima from which the geometrical information can be extracted with a comparable accuracy .",
    "we now argue that , provided the molecule is perfectly aligned as assumed , going beyond the sae should presumably not affect the readability of the diffraction pattern . indeed , the symmetry character of the quantum state holds for the @xmath179-electron , fully correlated , time - dependent wave function , as well as for the orbitals ( one electron wave functions ) .",
    "thus , all what was written above concerning the sae wave function should also apply to the @xmath179-electron wave function .",

    "the electron associated with the first trajectory ( blue line ) scatters in every direction and continues to drift in the field , but since the recollision time is approximately @xmath224 , the residual shift in velocity is negligible ( 0.12a.u . ) .",
    "this gives rise to a signal mostly contained within a circle of radius @xmath225a.u .",

    "this is not the case for the second ( green ) trajectory where the electron continues to drift , after recollision , for some half integer multiple of the optical period @xmath228 , giving rise to a large residual momentum drift of 4.87a.u . the associated signal is thus contained within a circle of same radius but centered about @xmath229a.u .",
    ", @xmath227 .",
    "a different situation occurs with the sine - square pulsed laser excitation . if one performs the same calculation as described above for the maximal recollision energies starting at the times associated with the opposite maxima of the electric field , one finds slightly different recollision energies for the `` blue '' and `` green '' trajectories , respectively @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "these are also characterized by different residual drift momentum , respectively -2.12a.u . and 2.29a.u .",
    "the recollision energy is therefore reduced compared to the one obtained with a rectangular pulse shape for two reasons : ( _ i _ ) the electric field is smaller in amplitude yielding different values of @xmath114 , and ( _ ii _ ) the electric field driving the electron back to the ion is constantly decreasing in amplitude , as opposed to the case of a rectangular pulse shape .",
