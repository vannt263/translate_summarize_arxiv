    "define a knot or link in @xmath0 to be hyperbolic if its complement is a hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold .",

    "embedded totally geodesic surfaces are relatively rare in knot and link complements .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite that there are no closed embedded totally geodesic surfaces in hyperbolic knot complements .",
    "this has been verified for hyperbolic knots that are alternating knots , tunnel number one knots , and 2-generator knots  @xcite , almost alternating knots  @xcite , toroidally alternating knots  @xcite , montesinos knots  @xcite , 3-bridge knots and double torus knots  @xcite ) and knots of braid index three  @xcite and four  @xcite .",
    "note that the conjecture does not hold for links .",
    "the first explicit counterexample was given in  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , it is demonstrated that for each @xmath6 , there exists a 2-component hyperbolic link that contains a closed embedded totally geodesic genus @xmath7 surface .    in this paper , we investigate surfaces that are not closed in knot and link complements",
    ". in particular , we are interested in totally geodesic seifert surfaces , where a seifert surface for a knot or link @xmath8 is a compact orientable surface whose boundary is @xmath8 .",
    "note that although a totally geodesic seifert surface need not necessarily be minimal genus , it is incompressible .",
    "work of thurston implies that a properly embedded surface @xmath5 with boundary in a hyperbolic knot exterior @xmath9 can have one of three possible behaviors :    1 .",
    "there is a nontrivial simple closed curve @xmath10 in @xmath5 that is not boundary parallel in @xmath5 but that corresponds to a parabolic isometry .",
    "this implies that @xmath10 is isotopic into a neighborhood of the missing knot . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath10 is an accidental parabolic curve and @xmath5 is an accidental surface .",
    "see  @xcite for more on these surfaces .",
    "@xmath5 is a quasi - fuchsian surface , with limit set a union of quasi - circles .",
    "this includes the case of @xmath5 being totally geodesic ( also called fuchsian ) , in which case the limit set is a union of geometric circles",
    "@xmath11 is a fibered knot and in some finite cover , @xmath5 lifts to a fiber . in this case , the limit set is the entire sphere .    in  @xcite",
    ", it is proved that if @xmath11 is not fibered , then any minimal genus seifert surface can not be accidental and hence must be quasi - fuchsian .",
    "see also  @xcite.a quasi - fuchsian surface @xmath5 can admit an essential annuli @xmath12 intersecting @xmath5 in its boundary .",
    "however , in this case , @xmath5 can not be totally geodesic .",
    "in essence , the existence of the annulus forces pairs of quasi - circles in the limit set of the cover to share two points , which a pair of circles that do not cross can not do .",
    "so , for a surface to be totally geodesic , it must not admit any essential annuli .",
    "nor can it admit an essential disk with boundary consisting of four arcs , two of which lie in the surface and two of which lie in the cusp .",
    "such a disk doubles to an essential annulus in the manifold obtained by doubling along the totally geodesic surface .",
    "however this contradicts the fact the double is a hyperbolic manifold .",
    "a seifert surface is said to be _",
    "free _ if the complement of a neighborhood of the seifert surface is a handlebody .",

    "we state a theorem that follows from the theorem on p. 217",
    "@xcite , but provide a complete proof here for convenience .    [ main ] let @xmath13 be an essential rigid hyperbolic @xmath33-orbifold embedded in a hyperbolic @xmath1-orbifold @xmath31 .",

    "every isometry @xmath36 of hyperbolic 3-space can be represented as the product of two order two elliptic isometries , each a rotation about a geodesic axis .",
    "if @xmath36 is hyperbolic , then the two axes , considered at subsets of @xmath37 , do not intersect . if @xmath36 is parabolic then they share an endpoint .",
    "if @xmath36 is elliptic , then they intersect in @xmath3 and the axis of rotation for the elliptic isometry passes through the point of intersection and is perpendicular to the plane containing both of the axes .    the fundamental group @xmath30 is realized as a discrete group @xmath38 of isometries of @xmath3 with subgroup @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "there exists a pair of isometries @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xmath39 , the product of which is a third isometry @xmath42 in @xmath39 . in the cases of @xmath21 and @xmath23 , we can choose these isometries corresponding to the three singularities and the three corner reflectors respectively . in the case of @xmath25",
    ", we can choose isometries corresponding to the corner reflector and to two lifts of the isometry corresponding to the singularity , one of which is conjgate to the other by an order two elliptic isometry corresponding to the boundary of the orbifold .",
    "each @xmath43 can be realized as the product of two isometries , each of which is an order two elliptic isometry about an axis .",
    "choose an axis for an order two elliptic isometry @xmath44 such that if @xmath40 is elliptic , the axis is perpendicular to the axis of @xmath40 . if @xmath40 is parabolic , choose the axis of @xmath44 so that it ends at the fixed point of @xmath40 . also make the axis simultaneously satisfy the same requirements for @xmath41 .",
    "then we can find order two elliptic isometries @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . note then that @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath42 is elliptic or parabolic , the axes for @xmath45 and @xmath46 must either intersect in @xmath3 or in @xmath50 . in either case , the three axes for @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 all lie in a geodesic plane @xmath51 .",
    "the entire group @xmath39 is generated by @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 so @xmath39 preserves @xmath51 .",
    "the orders of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 determine the angles of the triangle defined by the axes of @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 , and hence the resulting 2-dimensional hyperbolic orbifold @xmath35 that is the projection of @xmath51 to @xmath31 is rigid .",
    "exactly as in the proof of theorem 3.1 of  @xcite , we can prove that the limit set of @xmath51 is in fact also the limit set of a topological plane @xmath52 covering @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath13 is embedded , the limit sets of the topological planes covering @xmath13 can only intersect tangentially .",
    "hence the same holds for all the copies of @xmath51 under the group action , implying that the geodesic planes covering @xmath35 do not intersect in their interiors .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath35 is embedded and @xmath53 is a disjoint union of geodesic planes , and @xmath35 is a totally geodesic orbifold .",
    "suppose @xmath54 is an element of @xmath38 such that @xmath55 .",
    "then @xmath54 preserves the limit circle of @xmath51 .",
    "but then @xmath54 preserves the limit set of @xmath52 , implying @xmath56 .",
    "hence , @xmath13 and @xmath35 have the same fundamental group and are orbifold homeomorphic .    note that in the case the underlying space of @xmath35 is a disk , @xmath13 and @xmath35 must share the boundary arcs , which are order two singularity axes in @xmath31 .",
    "the orbifold @xmath13 can be isotoped so that it does not intersect @xmath35 in its interior as follows .",
    "first , put @xmath13 in general position relative to @xmath35 . utilizing the product neighborhoods of the singularities , cusps and boundaries of @xmath35",
    ", we can isotope @xmath13 so that there are no intersections curves near singularities , cusps , or boundaries of the two 2-orbifolds .",
    "hence , all the intersection curves are simple closed curves . a trivial intersection curve on one of the 2-orbifolds must be trivial on the other by the fact @xmath13 is essential and @xmath35 is totally geodesic .",
    "however , such a curve can then be eliminated by isotoping @xmath13 .",
    "a curve that is nontrivial on both @xmath13 and @xmath35 , and innermost such on @xmath13 must bound a disk with one singularity on each of @xmath13 and @xmath35 , denoted @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . since this implies that a loop around the singularity on @xmath13 is homotopic to the loop around the singularity on @xmath35 , the singularities must either both correspond to parabolic isometries or to elliptic isometries of the same order . then @xmath59 forms a sphere with two singularities of the same order . by irreducibility",
    ", @xmath59 bounds a ball containing an unknotted singular arc or cusp within it .",
    "hence , @xmath57 can be isotoped through @xmath58 to eliminate the intersection .",
    "now , @xmath13 and @xmath35 do not intersect . hence their lifts , which come paired with shared boundary circles , do not intersect .",
    "thus each pair of planes sharing a boundary circle bound a ball in @xmath3 that is intersected by none of its translates in the interior .",
    "thus , we can isotope the topological plane that is a lift of @xmath13 to the corresponding geodesic plane that is a lift of @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , we can do so equivariantly with respect to @xmath38 , and none of the disjoint balls bounded by the planes will intersect in the process .",
    "hence @xmath13 is isotopic to @xmath35 , as we wished to demonstrate .",

    "this follows immediately from theorem [ main ] .",
