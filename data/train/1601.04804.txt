    "the observed feature in the electron - doped hts system as well as in a number of hole - doped hts can be explained by a rather strong pinning due to an essential degree of the sample inhomogeneity .",
    "such an inhomogeneity may be associated both with the nonstoichiometric disorder inherent to nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 system and with the particularity of @xmath3 = 0.14 underdoped compound disposed in a vicinity of the antiferromagnetic - superconductor transition .",
