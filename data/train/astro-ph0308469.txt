    "dwarf galaxies are believed to be basic building blocks of the large scale structures in the universe . at the faintest end of the dwarf galaxies ,",
    "there are dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) . to date nine dsphs",
    "are known to be around our galaxy .",
    "these dsphs are the faintest galaxies among the known galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of these galaxies are similar in luminosity to the brightest globular clusters in our galaxy , but much bigger in size than the latter , making these galaxies distinguishable from globular clusters with similar masses .",
    "these dsphs , due to their proximity and low crowding , provide us with an excellent opportunity to investigate in detail the various properties of stellar populations and the star formation history in low mass stellar systems .",
    "there have been many studies of these galaxies since the first discovery of this kind of galaxy starting with the sculptor and fornax dsphs in 1938 @xcite .    among these dsphs ,",
    "the sextans dsph is the least studied galaxy .",
    "the sextans dsph was discovered in 1990 by @xcite who used ukst sky survey plates .",
    "it is the second last newcomer in the galactic dsphs .",
    "( the last newcomer is the sagittarius dsph which was discovered in 1994 by @xcite . )",
    "it has the lowest central surface brightness ( @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath23 ) among the known galaxies in the local group and has a high mass to luminosity ratio ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "the sextans dsph is large in the sky ( with core radius of @xmath25 arcmin and tidal radius of @xmath26 arcmin @xcite ) so that it is not easy to study all the stellar populations in the large fraction of the galaxy .",
    "previous photometric studies of this galaxy were based on either deep small - field photometry or shallow wide field photometry @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite presented a comparative study of star formation history of seven dsphs in the local group based on numerical modeling with the hst / wfpc2 photometry .",
    "however , the sextans dsph was not included in his study , because of no available hst / wfpc2 data of the sextans dsph .",
    "in this paper we present a study of stellar populations in the sextans dsph , based on deep wide field @xmath27 ccd photometry which reaches below the main sequence turnoff and covers a @xmath1 field including the center of the galaxy .",

    "some issues related with the results are discussed in section 13 , and primary results are summarized in the last section .",
    "@xmath27 ccd images of the sextans dsph were obtained at the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on the nights of ut 2001 february 16 - 17 , using the cfh12k mosaic ccd camera .",
    "the cfh12k camera is composed of twelve @xmath28 pixel chips ( @xmath29 pixels in total ) , covering a total field of @xmath30 on the sky at the f/4 prime focus of the cfht .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath31 per pixel .",
    "one field covering the central region of the sextans dsph was observed on the clear nights of feb 16 and 17 , 2001 .",
    "1 displays a finding chart for the observed cfh12k field of the sextans dsph on the digitized palomar observatory sky survey map .",
    "most of the bright stars seen in fig .",
    "1 are foreground stars , and the stars of the sextans dsph are barely visible . the observation log is listed in table 1 . seeing ranged from 0.8 to 1.3 arcsec . while both long and short exposures were taken with @xmath12 ( @xmath32 sec and 60 sec ) and @xmath8 filters ( @xmath33 sec and 60 sec ) , only a short exposure was secured with @xmath2 ( 60 sec )",
    ". therefore long exposure images were used to get deep @xmath0 photometry of the faint stars and short exposure images were used to get @xmath27 photometry of bright stars and to select variable star candidates .",
    "in addition , @xmath27 ccd images of smaller fields overlapped partially with the cfh12k field were obtained at the 1.8 m telescope of the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in korea , using a thinned site @xmath34 ccd camera during the observing runs for 2001 - 2002 .",
    "the field of view of the boao ccd image is @xmath35 , and the pixel scale is @xmath36 per pixel at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the boao telescope .",
    "seeing ranged from 1.0 to 2.4 arcsec .",
    "these boao ccd images were obtained with a purpose to calibrate the cfh12k photometry of the sextans dsph .",
    "five fields were observed , being overlapped partially with the cfh12k field .",
    "the gain and readout noise of the boao ccd camera are 1.8e @xmath37adu and 7.0 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "raw cfh12k images were preprocessed using the fits large image processing software ( flips ) .",
    "the flips is a highly automated software package developed for rapid reduction of the large amount of data by jean - charles cuillandre at the cfht .",
    "a detailed description of the flips is given in @xcite .",
    "raw boao images were preprocessed using the iraf .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the objects in the cfh12k ccd images were derived using the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routine in the digital photometry program daophot / allframe @xcite .",
    "then we derived the stellarity of the detected objects using the digital source extracting program sextractor @xcite .",
    "stellarity is a very useful parameter to separate the point sources and the extended sources in images .",
    "finally we selected as point sources the objects with stellarity larger than 0.3 .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the objects in the boao ccd images were derived using the aperture photometry routine in daophot .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the point sources in the boao ccd images were transformed onto the standard johnson - cousins photometric system using the photometric standard stars @xcite observed on the photometric night of nov 19 , 2001 at the boao .",
    "an aperture of radius 7 arcsec as used in @xcite was used to derive the aperture magnitudes of the standard stars in the boao ccd images .",
    "the standard transformation equations are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , where the upper cases represent the standard magnitudes , the lower cases the instrumental magnitudes ( with a zero point of 25.0 ) , and @xmath43 the airmass .",
    "the corresponding rms s are , respectively , 0.029 , 0.015 , 0.019 and 0.037 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the aperture magnitudes of the bright stars in the sextans were derived for the aperture radius of 7 arcsec , consistently with the standard stars .",
    "the apertures of radius of the fwhm were used first to derived the small aperture magnitudes , which were converted to the 7 arcsec radius aperture magnitudes applying aperture correction . then these magnitudes were transformed onto the standard system using the equations above .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the point sources in the cfh12k images were transformed onto the standard system using the boao photometry of the bright stars in the fields overlapped with the cfh12k field of the sextans dsph .",
    "the mean color coefficients for transformation were derived from the average of the color coefficients for 12 chips of the cfh12k camera : @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . using these mean color coefficients , we derived the zero points for each chip , which are listed in table 2 and are displayed in fig .",
    "the rms s of the zero points we derived for each chip are 0.02@xmath50.04 mag for @xmath2 , and 0.01@xmath50.03 mag for @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "the array of the chip numbers shown in fig.2 represents the real positions of the chips in the camera .",
    "2 shows that the zero points for 12 chips in the cfh12k camera change only by about 0.1 mag depending on the position of the chips .",
    "the trend that the zero points increase at the chips in the outer region of the field appears to be due to vignetting in the telescope .",
    "the total number of stars in the cfh12k photometry is about 23,800 , which are listed in table 3 ( provided fully in an electronic table ) .",
    "astrometric solutions of each chip in the cfh12k images were derived using the bright stars in the guide star catalog 2.2 ( http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/gsc/gsc2/gsc2home.htm ) , and were applied to derive the equatorial coordinates ( ra(2000 ) and dec(2000 ) ) of the stars in the images .",
    "fitting errors ( rms ) in astrometric solutions are 0.140.19 arcsec . the center of the galaxy is considered to be located at ra(2000)@xmath48 , and dec(2000)@xmath49 @xcite .    the mean errors of the cfh12k photometry are listed in table 4 and are displayed in fig .",
    "these errors are based on the internal daophot errors . in fig .",
    "3 we also plot the external mean errors which are based on the difference between the input magnitudes and the output magnitudes of the artificial stars which will be described in the following . both agree well except the fact that at the faint end the mean internal error is slightly larger than the external error .",
    "we used the internal mean errors in this study .",
    "we have derived completeness of our cfh12k @xmath0 photometry using the artificial star experiment with the addstar routine in daophot .",
    "we performed this artificial star experiment for one chip ( chip 8) in the center to derive a typical value .",
    "photometric completeness appears to change little among the chips , because the zero points of the chips change only at the level of about 0.1 mag , and because the degree of crowding affecting the stellar photometry is very low over the entire field covered by the cfh12k camera .",
    "we created the artificial stars so that the colors , magnitudes , luminosity functions of those stars are similar to those of the observed stars in the sextans dsph .",
    "we added 2000 artificial stars with @xmath50 mag to each ccd image , and the total number of added stars in five pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath8 images is 10,000 .",
    "we applied the same procedures to the resulting images with artificial stars as used originally in deriving the @xmath0 photometry from the ccd images of the sextans dsph .",
    "finally we derived the completeness as the ratio of the number of recovered stars to that of the added stars ( @xmath51 n(recovered)/n(added ) ) , which is listed in table 5 and is plotted in fig .",
    "4 shows that our photometry is 50 % complete at @xmath52 mag and @xmath53 mag .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath54 photometry of a smaller field ( @xmath55 ) in the sextans dsph than ours .",
    "we have compared our photometry with theirs for about 900 non - variable stars common between the two , the results of which are displayed in fig .",
    "5 . during the comparison process , it is found that there are slight systematic positional differences in the coordinates between the two studies : @xmath56ra@xmath57 arcsec and @xmath56dec@xmath58 arcsec where @xmath56 means this study minus @xcite .",
    "these differences are larger than our astrometric errors ( 0.140.19 arcsec ) as described in sec . 2.2 .    fig .",
    "5(a ) shows that the difference in @xmath12 ( @xmath59(this study ",
    "mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) increases slightly as the magnitude increase .",
    "a linear fit with two - sigma clipping to the data for 651 stars with @xmath60 mag yields @xmath61 ( rms=0.0099 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in @xmath62 in fig .",
    "5(b ) is on average almost zero .",
    "a linear fit with two - sigma clipping to the data for 653 stars with @xmath60 mag yields @xmath63 ( rms=0.0977 ) .",
    "the source of the difference in @xmath12 is not clear .",
    "6(a ) displays a @xmath12(@xmath12@xmath8 )  diagram of the measured stars in the cfh12k images .",
    "there are included some foreground stars and background objects in this figure .",
    "we need a control field to see the effect of these foreground and background objects .",
    "the size of our cfh12k field ( @xmath30 ) is , although wide , still smaller than the size of the sextans which has a core radius of @xmath25 arcmin and a tidal radius of @xmath26 arcmin @xcite .",
    "there is no suitable region which can be considered as a control field inside our cfh12k field .",
    "therefore we display , in fig .",
    "6(b ) , a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a field close to palomar 3 , a galactic globular cluster , which is about 3 degrees from the sextans dsph in the sky , given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 photometry of this field were obtained using the same instrument during the same observing run as the sextans dsph was observed ( on feb 16 , 2001 ) .",
    "the exposure times are 1500 sec for @xmath12 and 1200 sec for @xmath8 .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath64 mag were saturated in the control field images .",
    "this control field is of the same angular size as that of the sextans dsph field , and is centered at ra(2000)@xmath65 and dec(2000)@xmath66 , about 33 arcmin south from palomar 3 .",
    "@xcite used only daophot to derive the photometry of this control field , while we used daophot / allframe and sextractor to derive the photometry of the sextans dsph .",
    "so the information of the sextractor stellarity of the control field is not available .",
    "there may be some variation of the field stars over 3 degrees in the sky so that this control field can be used only a guide .",
    "comparison of the two cmds in fig .",
    "6 shows that most bright yellow and red stars with @xmath67 seen uniformly in the cmd are considered to be foreground stars , and a large number of faint red objects with @xmath68 mag are compact background galaxies .",
    "note that most of the background galaxies were subtracted mostly in the cmd of the sextans dsph where the stellarity of the sextractor was used for selecting point sources ( the stellarity of the sextractor was not used for deriving the photometry of the control field ) .",
    "the cmd of the sextans dsph in fig .",
    "6(a ) shows several notable features .",
    "( 1 ) there is seen a steep and well - defined red giant branch ( rgb ) extending up to @xmath69 mag at @xmath70 .",
    "( 2 ) there is a prominent red horizontal branch ( rhb ) at @xmath71 mag and @xmath72 , and a weaker blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) at @xmath73 with a tail extending down to @xmath74 mag at @xmath75 .",
    "( 3 ) there are seen a small number of stars at the blue side of the rgb above the hb , which are agb stars .",
    "( 4 ) there are some stars between the bhb and the rhb , which are mostly rr lyrae variable stars , as shown in the following section .",
    "( 5 ) there are seen many stars below @xmath76 mag which are main sequence ( ms ) stars with old age . a main sequence turn - off ( msto )",
    "is seen at @xmath77 mag at @xmath7 .",
    "a large spread in color at the faint magnitude is mostly due to photometric errors ( as listed in table 4 ) .",
    "( 6 ) there is a distinguishable group of blue stragglers extending up to @xmath78 mag at @xmath79 above the ms .",
    "it is expected that there exist many variable stars in the cfh12k field of the sextans dsph , which are included in the cmd in fig .",
    "@xcite found 44 variable stars in a total area of @xmath55 in the sextans dsph : 36 rr lyrae , 6 anomalous cepheids , one long - period red variable , and one foreground contact binary .",
    "our cfh12k field is 3.6 times larger than the field used for the variable search by @xcite . since",
    "long exposure cfh12k images and short exposure cfh12k images were obtained with a time lag of about one day , they are useful to identify variable star candidates .    we have searched for variable star candidates by comparing the photometry of short @xmath0 exposures and long @xmath0 exposures .",
    "7 shows the difference in @xmath12 magnitudes between the short and long exposures .",
    "we consider , as variable star candidates , 122 stars ( marked by the squares in fig .",
    "7 ) with magnitude differences larger than three times the mean error at given magnitudes , which are listed in table 6 . considering that the amplitude of variability is larger in @xmath12 than in @xmath8 , we selected , as the variable star candidates , those which were detected in both @xmath12 and @xmath8 or in @xmath12 only . eighty five among these 122 candidates were detected as variable stars in both @xmath12 and @xmath8 , and thirty seven were in @xmath12 only .",
    "table 6 lists the @xmath27 photometry of the variable star candidates which are derived from the short exposure images .",
    "most of the stars in the vertical structure with @xmath80 mag seen in fig . 7 are probably rr lyrae stars . among the 43 variable stars",
    "the positions of which were given by @xcite , 23 were recovered both in @xmath12 and @xmath8 , 7 were in @xmath12 only , 2 were in @xmath8 only , and 11 were not recovered . among the 35 rr lyraes with positions given by @xcite ,",
    "26 rr lyrae were recovered , and 9 rr lyrae were not recovered in our search ( one of them was recovered in @xmath8 only so that it was considered as not - recovered ) . therefore the recovery rate of rr lyrae in our search based on two - epoch photometry is estimated to be 74 % .",
    "8 shows the @xmath12(@xmath12@xmath8 )  and @xmath12(@xmath2@xmath12 )  diagrams of these variable star candidates ( open squares ) .",
    "the rr lyrae stars and anomalous cepheids found by @xcite are also plotted in fig .",
    "8 ( red and blue triangles , respectively ) .",
    "there are seen two main groups of variable star candidates which are probably the members of the sextans dsph , as marked in fig .",
    "first , the rr lyrae group ( labeled by rr ) : most of the variable star candidates as well as the previously known rr lyraes are located in the rr lyrae instability region .",
    "there are 90 rr lyrae candidates including known rr lyraes .",
    "there are three new rr lyrae candidates in the field used for the variable star search by @xcite .",
    "these three rr lyrae candidates may not be real rr lyrae variables or might have been missed by @xcite . since the latter is unlikely , we estimate that our false detection rate of rr lyraes is 9 % .",
    "since the recovery rate of our search for rr lyraes is 74 % ( as shown above ) , the total number of the rr lyraes in the cfh12k field is estimated to be ( 90 0.91)/0.74 = 111 .",
    "note that the rr lyrae candidates are located along the region crossing the hb with some angle .",
    "this is because the photometry of these variable star candidates are based on the single - epoch measurement , not on the mean magnitudes over the period .    secondly , the anomalous cepheid group ( labeled by ac ) : a small number of variable star candidates above the hb may be anomalous cepheids .",
    "there are a few candidates in addition to the known six anomalous cepheids .",
    "however , they are overlapped with the brightest rr lyraes so that time - series photometry is needed to identify them .",
    "two of the faint variable star candidates are located in the blue straggler region in fig .",
    "these two stars may be sx phoenicis stars or eclipsing binaries .",
    "sx phoenicis stars are population ii short - period pulsating variables found in galactic globular clusters and dsphs @xcite , and all known sx phoenicis stars are found to be blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "however , these two stars were detected as variable only in @xmath12 so that it needs further confirmation .",
    "other variable star candidates not belonging to the above groups are probably foreground variable stars in our galaxy or other kinds of variable stars in the sextans dsph .    fig .",
    "9 displays a finding chart of these variable star candidates .",
    "time - series photometry obtaining the full light curves of these variable star candidates is needed to study in detail their properties . in this study",
    "we use them only for identifying the variable stars in the color - magnitude diagrams , by which we can distinguish the member stars of the sextans dsph from the foreground stars and we can count the number of variable stars in the comparison of stellar populations .",
    "we have derived approximate fiducial sequences in the @xmath8(@xmath12@xmath8 )  diagram of the sextans dsph by using eye - estimation , the mean color , and the number density in the color magnitude diagram of the entire cfh12k field .",
    "these fiducial sequences are listed in table 7 , and are displayed by the solid lines in the @xmath12(@xmath12@xmath8 )  diagram of fig . 10 .",
    "variable stars ( and candidates ) are not plotted in fig . 10 .    in fig .",
    "10 we also display the number density contour map for the ms stars with @xmath68 mag which was used as an aid in deriving the fiducial sequence of the ms . two dashed lines at the left and right of the rgb fiducial line represent the boundary with @xmath81 mag .",
    "mean photometric errors versus magnitudes are also plotted by the error bars in the leftside of the figure . while the color spread in the bright rgb is much larger than the mean photometric errors , the color spread in the sgb and ms is getting comparable to the mean photometric errors .",
    "the fiducial line for the ms shows that the bluest part of the ms is located at @xmath7 and @xmath6 mag .",
    "reddening , distance , and metallicity are derived iteratively from the photometry . here",
    "we describe how we adopt the reddening and how we estimate the distance to the sextans .",
    "metallicity will be derived in the following section .",
    "the position of the sextans dsph in the sky ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) indicates that the foreground reddening toward this galaxy is low and the morphological type of this galaxy implies that the internal reddening is negligible . while the old galactic extinction map @xcite gives a value for the foreground reddening toward the sextans dsph , @xmath84 , a new galactic extinction map @xcite gives a slightly higher value , @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite lists @xmath86 for the sextans dsph in the review of the dwarf galaxies of the local group .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite estimated the reddening directly from the @xmath54 photometry of rr lyrae stars , using the fact that the minimum light ( @xmath2@xmath12 )  colors of rr@xmath87 stars are constant @xcite .",

    "we adopt the reddening of @xmath94 for the sextans dsph .",
    "we have estimated the distance to the sextans dsph using the @xmath8-band magnitude of the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) , following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the trgb method , which was systematically applied to nearby galaxies for the first time by @xcite and @xcite , has proved to be an excellent distance indicator for resolved galaxies with old giants ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "this method takes advantage of the fact that @xmath8-band magnitude of the trgb is little sensitive to metallicity ( for [ fe / h]@xmath95 dex ) or age ( for older than a few gyr ) , and can be used efficiently to estimate the distances to resolved galaxies with old populations .",
    "the @xmath8 magnitude of the trgb is estimated using the @xmath96 diagram in fig .",
    "11 and the luminosity function of red giant stars .",
    "we have derived the @xmath8-band luminosity function of red giant stars by counting stars around the rgb in the @xmath8(@xmath12@xmath8 )  diagram ( stars located inside the rgb boundaries shown in fig .",

    "there are several estimates of the metallicity of the stars in the sextans dsph , starting in 1991 , which are summarized in table 8 .",

    "table 8 shows that there is a significant difference among the mean values of the metallicity ( [ fe / h]=1.6 to 2.1 dex ) , while the metallicity dispersion estimates agree well ( @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath164 dex ) .",
    "interestingly the distribution of previous estimates of the mean metallicity is roughly bimodal , with one peak at [ fe / h]@xmath165 dex @xcite , and another peak at [ fe / h]@xmath166 dex @xcite .",

    "in addition , they found that the average even - z abundance of these stars in the sextans dsph , [ @xmath175/fe]@xmath176 dex , is significantly lower than that of the halo field stars ( [ @xmath175/fe]@xmath177 dex ) and the stars in m92 ( [ @xmath175/fe]@xmath178 dex ) , although these three samples have similar metallicity .",
    "the results given by @xcite and @xcite are considered to have more weights than the result given by @xcite , because the former are based either on much larger sample or on higher resolution spectroscopy compared to the latter .",
    "our mean metallicity estimate is very similar to the [ fe / h]@xmath179 dex peak , and our metallicity spread value is consistent with previous estimates .",

    "the agb bump appears when the core he burning switches to the shell he burning .",
    "agb bumps are in general difficult to detect , because the number of stars in the agb bump is small due to short evolution time for the agb bump .",

    ", there are three galaxies for which two rgb bumps were suggested to have been detected ( sculptor , sextans and leo ii ) , two galaxies for which one rgb bump was detected ( ursa minor , sagittarius ) , and one galaxy which showed little evidence ( draco ) .",
    "the brighter bump is brighter than the fainter rgb bump by 0.6 mag for sextans ( [ fe / h]=2.1 dex ) , by 0.55 mag for sculptor ( [ fe / h]=1.7 dex ) , and by 0.45 mag for leo ii ( [ fe / h]=1.6 dex ) .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath12 magnitude difference between the brighter bump and fainter bump decreases with the increasing metallicity , which is contrary to the theoretical prediction for the relation between the metallicity and @xmath12 magnitude difference between the agb bump and the rgb bump@xcite .",

    "we have derived the @xmath12-band luminosity function of the rgb and the ms stars in the sextans dsph , which is displayed in fig . 15 . in deriving the luminosity function we subtracted the foreground and background contribution using the photometry of the control field close to pal 3 ( as described in sec .",

    "15 , we plot , for comparison , the luminosity function of the metal - poor galactic globular cluster m92 ( @xmath231 ) based on the @xmath0 photometry given by @xcite , who used the same cfh12k as used in this study of the sextans dsph .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath232 mag in m92 ( corresponding to @xmath233 mag of the sextans dsph ) were saturated in the images used by @xcite .",
    "foreground and background contaminations for m92 were subtracted using the control field for m92 .",
    "the luminosity function of m92 was arbitrarily shifted vertically to match that of the sextans dsph at @xmath234 mag and shifted horizontally according to the distance of the sextans dsph in fig .",
    "15 shows that the luminosity function of the sextans dsph is generally similar to that of m92 in several aspects : the slope of the ms , the slope of the sgb and rgb , and even the position of the rgb bump ( at @xmath235 mag ) .",
    "this result is also consistent with the fact that the fiducial sequences of the sextans dsph is very similar to that of m92 as shown in fig .",
    "11 ( except for the presence of the prominent rhb in the sextans dsph ) . however , there is seen some difference as well .",
    "some slight excess of the sextans stars over those of m92 is seen in the sgb and the beginning part of the ms ( @xmath236 mag ) .",
    "this indicates that there exist some populations with younger age in the sextans dsph , in addition to the very old population like that in m92 .",
    "there is seen also some excess in the faint end of the ms ( @xmath237 mag ) of the sextans dsph , showing that the luminosity function of the faint ms of the sextans is slightly steeper than that of m92 . at this faint end ,",
    "the subtraction of the background objects is not perfect for the sextans dsph ( because the data for our control field used here is only approximate ) , while the luminosity function of m92 given by @xcite is considered to be more reliable .",
    "therefore the excess at the faint end may be due to imperfect subtraction of the background objects , or they may be an intrinsic feature of the sextans dsph .",
    "further studies are needed to clarify this point .",
    "one remarkable feature seen in the cmd of the sextans dsph is the existence of a larger number of blue straggler stars ( bs ) .",
    "blue stars with @xmath238 and @xmath239 mag are considered to be mostly bss . while there are 231 stars in this range in the cmd of the sextans dsph , there are 8 stars in the same range in the cmd of the control field ( fig .",
    "therefore the contribution due to field stars in the bs sample is only 3% .",
    "the bss in the sextans dsph were discovered early by @xcite , who covered a smaller field that the field used in this study .",
    "we have investigated the spatial distribution and luminosity function of these bss in the sextans dsph , providing important clues to understanding the origin of the bss in the dsphs .",
    "16 displays the spatial distribution of the 238 bss with @xmath238 and @xmath240 mag .",
    "we have divided the bss into two groups to investigate any systematic difference : bright bss ( @xmath241 mag ) and faint bss ( @xmath242 mag ) .",
    "16 shows immediately that the bright bss ( filled circles ) are more centrally concentrated than the faint bss ( open circles ) , and that there is no bs within @xmath243 arcsec .    in fig .",
    "17 we plot the radial variation of n(bs)/n(sgb ) .",
    "n(bs)/n(sgb ) is a ratio of the number of the bss and that of the sgb stars in the same magnitude range ( @xmath244 mag ) , indicating a relative variation of the bss with respect to the sgb stars .",
    "17 shows two notable features .",
    "first , there is seen little radial variation of n(bs)/n(sgb ) for the entire sample of the bss ( black circles ) , telling that the radial distribution of the bss is similar to that of the sgb stars .",
    "this result indicates that the bss in the sextans dsph may be old and of the same kind of bss as those seen in old globular clusters .",
    "secondly , n(bs)/n(sgb ) for the bright bss is dramatically different from that for the faint bss , n(bs)/n(sgb ) for the bright bss is steeply decreasing with increasing radius up to at @xmath245 arcsec ( showing a strong central concentration ) , and may get constant at @xmath246 arcsec . on the other hand , n(bs)/n(sgb ) for the faint bss is the lowest at the innermost region ( @xmath247 arcsec @xmath248 arcsec ) and is approximately constant at a higher level at the outer region .",
    "we have derived the luminosity functions of the bss as shown in fig .",
    "18 . in fig .",
    "18 , we plotted the luminosity function of the bss located in the inner region ( @xmath249 arcmin , blue histogram ) and those in the outer region ( @xmath250 arcmin , red histogram ) , respectively .",
    "the luminosity functions of these bss keep increasing up to @xmath251 mag , after which it decreases slightly up to @xmath252 mag .",
    "it keeps increasing again beyond @xmath252 mag , where the ms stars are dominating .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the bss and ms stars for @xmath253 mag so that we consider only bss brighter than @xmath254 mag .    in fig .",
    "18 , we also compared the luminosity function of the bss in the sextans with the combined luminosity function of 425 bss in 21 galactic globular clusters given by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "the luminosity function of the bss in the sextans is found to be roughly similar to the bright part of the luminosity function of the bss in the galactic globular clusters .",
    "the sextans dsph has a small number of bss a few tenths magnitude brighter than the brightest bss in the galactic globular clusters .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "18 shows that there is a significant difference in the luminosity functions of the bss between in the inner region and in the outer region : the luminosity function of the bss in the inner region extends to a few tenths mag brighter magnitude ( reaching @xmath78 mag ) and has a flatter slope , compared with that of the outer region .",
    "linear fits to the logarithmic luminosity functions yield a slope of @xmath255 for the inner region ( @xmath256 mag ) and a slope of @xmath257 for the outer region ( @xmath258 mag ) .",
    "the trend is similar to the case seen in m3 which shows uniquely a bimodal distribution of bss @xcite .",
    "thus these evidences ( the spatial distribution in fig .",
    "16 , the radial distribution in fig .",
    "17 , and the luminosity function in fig .",
    "18 ) show consistently that the brighter bss in the sextans dsph are more strongly centrally concentrated toward the center of the galaxy , while the fainter bss are depleted in the central region ( at @xmath259 arcmin ) and are spread as the old low - mass stars like sgb stars .",
    "bss have been found in open clusters , globular clusters and several dsphs since its first discovery in m3 by @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the bss is not clearly known , and the nature of the bss in the dsphs , in particular , has been controversial .",
    "the bss in dsphs may be of the same kind of old bss as these seen in the globular clusters or they may be of different kind , i.e. , normal ms stars with intermediate - age @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss the first possibility : the bss in the sextans dsph are old bss as seen in globular clusters , and the second possibility in the following section .    in the case of the bss in galactic globular clusters ,",
    "it is generally believed today that the bss in dense environments like globular clusters might have formed via mergers of primordial binaries and/or mergers of stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the bss in the inner region of clusters are preferentially brighter and bluer than the outer bss , because there are generally more massive stars , due to dynamical mass segregation , in the inner region of the cluster than in the outer region .",
    "the bss formed via collision of these massive stars in the inner region will get brighter and hotter ( due to reduced envelope opacity in the merger remnant ) than those in the outer region of the cluster @xcite .    however , we note that there are a few fundamental differences between the sextans dsph and galactic globular clusters with regard to the origin of bss .",
    "first , the central luminosity density of the sextans dsph ( 0.002 @xmath260 pc@xmath261 , @xcite ) is significantly lower than that of globular clusters ( e.g. , 3200 @xmath260 pc@xmath261 for m3 , @xcite ) so that the collision rates must be much lower and the dynamical evolution must be much slower in the sextans dsph than in globular clusters .",
    "therefore it is not expected that mass segregation of the bss results from dynamical evolution in the central region of the sextans dsph .",
    "secondly , the radial variation of the relative frequency of the bss in galactic globular clusters is seen over several times the core radius ( @xmath262 ) ( see fig . 8 in @xcite ) , while that of the sextans dsph is seen within one core radius ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "a large core radius and the presence of a larger number of bss in the sextans dsph allow us to investigate the radial variation of the bss within the core radius in detail , which is difficult for the case of the globular clusters .",
    "further studies with detailed modeling are needed to understand the observational results presented here and investigate the origin of the bss in the sextans dsph .",
    "in fig . 19 , we estimate roughly ages of the stellar populations in the sextans dsph , overlaying theoretical isochrones in the cmds .",
    "theoretical isochrones were shifted according to the distance and reddening of the sextans as derived in this study .",
    "the theoretical isochrones in fig .",
    "19 are padova isochrones based on the convective overshooting models for the metallicity z=0.0004 and ages of 1 , 2 , 4 , 7.9 , 10 , and 12.6 gyr @xcite .",
    "the metallicity @xmath264 corresponds to [ fe / h]=1.7 dex for [ @xmath175/fe]=0.02 as in the sextans dsph @xcite .",
    "this value is higher than the metallicity of the sextans , [ fe / h]=2.1 dex , but the isochrones with @xmath264 fits better the rgb part of the sextans dsph ( that of m92 with [ fe / h]=2.24 dex as well ) than those with lower metallicity .",
    "so we used the isochrones with @xmath264 in fig . 19 .",
    "the fiducial sequences of m92 ( bhb , lower rgb , and ms ; blue line ) are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the fiducial sequences of the rgb and the ms of the sextans dsph agree well with those of m92 , indicating that the age of the sextans dsph is very similar to that of m92 which is one of the typical old halo globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "19(a ) shows that the fiducial sequences of the sgb and msto of the sextans are reasonably matched by the isochrone of 12.6 gyr .",
    "some ms stars just above the fiducial sequence of the ms are fit approximately by the isochrone of 10 gyr .",
    "therefore most of the ms stars in the sextans dsph are estimated to be formed before 10 gyr , mostly at about 13 gyr .",
    "a small number of anomalous cepheid stars are fit roughly by the blue loop part ( pulsational instability region ) of the isochrone of 1 gyr in fig .",
    "19(b ) .    in fig .",
    "19(b ) the position of the bs stars is consistent with the ms part of the isochrones of 2 to 6 gyr .",
    "if these bs stars are not the same kind as the bss in globular clusters , as suggested by @xcite , then these stars may be intermediate - age ms stars formed 2 gyr to 6 gyr ago .",
    "if so , it is expected that some red giant clump stars are present between the rhb and rgb ( but a slightly below the rhb ) , which are not seen clearly in the cmd .",
    "therefore it is concluded that the possibility that these bss are intermediate - age normal ms stars is very low .",
    "@xcite also concluded that the bs populations in the ursa minor dsph are probably bss originating in the old population , not the intermediate - age ms stars , from the relative amount and spatial distribution of those stars .",
    "it still remains to explain why there are relatively much more bss in the dsphs than in the galactic globular clusters .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies look monotonous apparently and seem to be composed of a single homogeneous component .",
    "however , there are mounting evidence that dwarf galaxies are not only more complex than expected , but also they show significant spatial variation ( or radial gradient ) of the stellar populations .",
    "recently @xcite presented a systematic and homogeneous analysis of population gradients in several dsphs in the local group including the sextans dsph .",
    "we have searched for any radial variation of several stellar populations in the sextans dsph .",
    "first , we divide the entire cfh12k field into four different regions depending on the radius from the center of the sextans dsph : region 1 at @xmath265 arcmin ( central region ) , region 2 at @xmath266 arcmin @xmath267 arcmin ( inner region ) , region 3 at @xmath268 arcmin @xmath269 arcmin ( intermediate region ) , and region 4 at @xmath270 arcmin ( outer region ) .",
    "the boundaries for the regions were determined so that the numbers of the mid - rgb stars with @xmath271 and @xmath272 mag are the same among the regions for easy comparison ( and it turned out that the numbers of the bright ms stars are also almost the same among the regions ) .",
    "the areas of the central region , inner region , intermediate region and outer region are 167 , 213 , 327 , and 469 arcmin@xmath273 , respectively .",
    "20 displays the @xmath12(@xmath12@xmath8 )  diagrams of these four regions .",
    "secondly , we select several stellar populations of interest in the cmd , as marked by the boxes in fig . 20",
    ": agb bump , agb group , rgb bump , bhb , rr lyrae , rhb , bright bs ( bs1 ) , faint bs ( bs2 ) , ms , blue rgb / red rgb and blue sgb / red sgb ( bluer and redder than the fiducial sequence of the rgb and sgb , respectively ) , and a sample of foreground stars with @xmath274 and @xmath275 mag .",
    "20 plots also the fiducial sequences of the rgb and ms , with the boundaries of @xmath81 mag around the fiducial sequence .",
    "we have derived the radial variation of the number of these selected stellar populations in the four regions , which is plotted in fig .",
    "21 and listed in table 9 .",
    "note that the numbers of the mid - rgb and ms stars are almost the same among the regions , so that the numbers of each population in fig .",
    "21 represent the relative numbers with respect to the number of the mid - rgb and ms stars in each region .",
    "the number of foreground stars is roughly proportional to the area of each region ( see fig .",
    "21(f ) ) .    figs .",
    "20 and 21 show clear differences in several aspects among the regions : ( 1 ) the luminosity of the bright bss decreases as the galactocentric radius increases , from @xmath276 mag in the central region to @xmath277 mag in the outer region , as discussed in sec .",
    "10 ; ( 2 ) the number of the bright bss decreases as the radius increases , as seen in sec . 10 , while the number of the faint bss increases ;",
    "( 3 ) while the sgb stars ( with @xmath278 mag ) are located mostly in the red side of the fiducial sequence in the central region , the sgb stars are mostly in the blue side of the fiducial sequence in the outer region ; ( 4 ) the rgb stars ( with @xmath279 mag ) show a similar trend to that of the sgb stars in that the rgb stars in the central region are redder than those in the outer region , but less clearly due to the much smaller number of rgb stars ; ( 5 ) the number of the rhb stars decreases significantly as the radius increases , while the numbers of the bhb stars and rr lyrae variables ( candidates ) increase slightly ; ( 6 ) the rgb bump ( bump 1 ) is clearly seen in the central region , while the brighter agb bump ( bump 2 ) is mostly seen in the inner region and the number of the agb group change little",
    ". however , due to the small numbers of the rgb bump , agb bump stars and agb stars , the uncertainty of this trend is large .",
    "we have also investigated the population gradient using the cumulative distribution functions and the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "22 shows the cumulative distribution functions versus radial positions of these selected populations . in fig .",
    "22 , the dashed line represents the foreground stars which are uniformly distributed , and the black solid line represents the ms stars ( @xmath280 mag ) of the sextans dsph which are centrally concentrated around the center of the galaxy .",
    "the cumulative distribution functions of the fainter ms with ( @xmath281 mag ) , though not plotted , looks almost the same as that plotted in fig . 22 . these two lines can be used as guide lines for inspecting radial variations of other populations .",
    "we have performed a kolmogorov - smirnov test to quantify the probability that two selected populations are drawn from the same sample ( k - s probability ) , the results of which are listed in table 10 .",
    "22 and table 10 show several conclusions which are consistent with those based on figs . 20 and 21 : ( 1 ) the red rgb stars are more strongly centrally concentrated than the blue rgb stars .",
    "the k - s probability for the red rgb and the blue rgb is zero , @xmath282 % .",
    "the former is more centrally concentrated than the ms , and the latter is more extended than the ms ; ( 2 ) the rhb stars are more strongly centrally concentrated than the bhb stars and the rr lyraes .",
    "the k - s probability for the rhb and the bhb is only 5.7 % .",
    "the former is more centrally concentrated than the ms , and the latter is more extended than the ms ; ( 3 ) the rr lyraes are similar to the bhb stars in the radial distribution at @xmath283 arcsec , but they are more extended out than the bhb stars at @xmath284 arcsec ; ( 4 ) the bright bss are more strongly centrally concentrated than the faint bss .",
    "the k - s probability for the bright and faint bss is close to zero , 0.4% .",
    "the k - s probability for the bright bss and the rhb is 57.0 % , and the k - s probability for the faint bss and the bhb is 51.7 % .",
    "this indicates that the bright bss are strongly correlated with the rhb , while the faint bss are with the bhb .",
    "( 5 ) the rgb bump stars are more strongly centrally concentrated than the agb bump at @xmath285 arcsec , but the latter are more strongly centrally concentrated than the former at @xmath286 arcsec ; the k - s probability for the rgb bump and the agb bump is 21.3 % . (",
    "6 ) the rgb bump follows the rhb , while the agb bump follows the bhb .",
    "the k - s probability for the rgb bump and the rhb is 75.1% , and the k - s probability for the agb bump and the bhb is 89.0 % .    in summary ,",
    "there are seen significant radial gradients of various kinds of stellar populations in the sextans dsph : the red rgb , red sgb , rhb , bright bss , and rgb bump are , respectively , more strongly centrally concentrated than the blue rgb , blue sgb , bhb , faint bss and agb bump .",
    "our results for the rgb and hb are consistent with the findings of @xcite who used washington @xmath287 photometry .    what is the origin of the population gradient seen in the sextans dsph ?",
    "@xcite discussed in detail several possibilities to explain the population gradients seen in several galaxies in the local group ( including the sextans dsph ) , concluding that the metallicity is a main driver for the population gradients in some galaxies ( sextans , sculptor , tucana , and andromeda vi ) , and age is a critical factor in carina . in forthcoming paper , we are planning to investigate in detail the origin of this population gradient using the star formation history models ( lee et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "in the study of the sculptor dsph , an analog to the sextans dsph , @xcite suggested , that the metallicity distribution of the stars in the sculptor dsph is bimodal ( one at [ fe / h]@xmath288 dex and another at [ fe / h]@xmath289 dex ) , based on a discontinuity in the @xmath12-band luminosities of the hb stars ( the blue edge of the rhb is about 0.15 mag fainter than the red edge of the bhb ) and the presence of two rgb bumps ( a blue bump at @xmath290 mag and a red fainter bump at @xmath291 mag ) ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) . the metal poor populations ( bhb , blue rgb , blue bright rgb bump ) are spatially more extended than the metal rich populations ( rhb , red rgb , red faint rgb bump ) , and the hb index increases by 0.4 from the center to the outer region at @xmath292 arcsec . in addition",
    ", they suggested that the metal - poor population formed in an earlier , more extended burst .",
    "motivated by the @xcite s study on the sculptor dsph , @xcite suggested , from wide - field ( @xmath293 arcmin@xmath273 ) @xmath27 ccd photometry ( reaching to @xmath294 mag ) , that the sextans dsph also has two old populations : a major one with [ fe / h]@xmath295 dex and a minor one with [ fe / h]@xmath296 dex .",
    "this conclusion is based on three points : ( 1 ) there is a bhb which appears to lie on a brighter sequence than the rhb and the rr lyrae stars in their @xmath297 diagram ; ( 2 ) there are hints that the @xmath298 color distribution of the rgb stars with @xmath299 mag is bimodal , with a color difference of @xmath300 ; and ( 3 ) two rgb bumps are found to be at @xmath301 and 20.8 mag .",
    "however , our results are not consistent with the above points given by @xcite as follows .",
    "first , the red edge of the bhb in the sextans dsph is not brighter than , but is rather slightly fainter than the blue edge of the rhb in the @xmath8-magnitude ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , and the former is very similar to the latter in the @xmath12 magnitude ( the difference is only @xmath302 mag ) ( see fig . 10 and sec .",
    "this result is the opposite to the first point of @xcite . a small number of stars seen slightly above the red edge of the bhb in fig .",
    "3 turned out to be mostly rr lyrae variables ( as shown in fig .",
    "note the contrast between the cmds with variable stars ( fig .",
    "3 and 8) and without variable stars ( fig .",
    "thus the first point of @xcite is not supported by our result .",
    "in addition , this shows that there is a difference between the sextans and the sculptor in the luminosity difference between the bhb and the rhb .    secondly , the @xmath14 color distribution of the rgb ( excluding the agb ) in fig .",
    "13 shows little hint of bimodality for @xmath303 mag and that the color distribution is roughly constant over the range of bright magnitude ( @xmath151 mag ) ( but the number of stars is too small to do reliable gaussian fitting ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that the @xmath298 color distribution is bimodal ( though weakly ) over the range @xmath299 mag , and that the color differences of the two peaks are the same ( @xmath300 ) for three ranges of magnitudes , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and @xmath306 mag ( see their fig .",
    "if these two weak peaks are due to two populations with [ fe / h]=1.8 and @xmath307 dex , it is expected that the color difference of the two peaks should decrease as the magnitude increases ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "10 and the fiducial sequences of galactic globular clusters in fig .",
    "in addition , the metallicity distribution of 43 rgb stars in the sextans dsph based on the spectroscopic observations by @xcite does not show any hint of bimodality , although it shows a large range of [ fe / h ] from @xmath308 to 1.57 dex ( see their fig .",
    "therefore the bimodal color distribution of the rgb suggested by @xcite , if it exists , does not necessarily lead to the existence of two old populations with [ fe / h ] = 1.8 and @xmath309 dex .",
    "finally , the brighter bump seen on the blue rgb is probably an agb bump , not an rgb bump , as discussed in sec .",
    "8 .    in summary ,",
    "our results support none of the three points @xcite used for suggesting that the sextans dsph also has two old populations .",
    "however , a large spread in the color distribution of the upper rgb shows that there is a metallicity dispersion of @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath164 dex , indicating that the major star formation must have continued over a few gyr with increasing metallicity .",
    "the sextans dsph has been considered as a distinguishable outlier among the dsphs in the local group because of its metallicity , integrated luminosity and the horizontal branch index ( starting from the earliest studies of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the hb index which is defined as ( n(bhb)-n(rhb))/(n(bhb)+n(rr)+n(rhb ) ) is a very useful parameter to represent the characteristics of hb populations in globular clusters and resolved galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have derived the value of the hb index of the sextans dsph , as listed in table 9 .",
    "we discuss this point using the most recent data of the local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "23(a ) shows the [ fe / h ] versus @xmath310 diagram of the sextans in comparison with other local group dwarf galaxies ( symbols ) and galactic globular clusters ( dots ) .",
    "the morphological types of the dwarf galaxies are dsphs ( filled squares ) , dwarf irregulars ( dirrs , pentagons ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des , filled circles ) , and transition types between dsph and dirr ( open triangles ) .",
    "the data used for fig .",
    "23 are based on the compiled data of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , including our estimates of [ fe / h ] and the hb index for the sextans .",
    "it has been known long that the mean metallicity of the dsphs increases with the increasing luminosity , in contrast to the galactic globular clusters , as shown in fig .",
    "the sextans dsph has the lowest metallicity among the dsphs .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the data of metallicity and the luminosity for the early type galaxies ( the dsphs and des ) yields [ fe / h]@xmath311 with rms of 0.17 .",
    "the sexans has a deviation of @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath312 dex , only slightly larger than one sigma .",
    "thus the sextans dsph follows reasonably well the [ fe / h]@xmath310 relation of other dsphs and des including the sculptor .",
    "23(b ) displays that [ fe / h ] versus the hb index diagram for the sextans dsph in comparison with other local group dwarf galaxies ( symbols ) and galactic globular clusters ( dots ) .",
    "theoretical isochrones based on the hb models for relative ages of 1.1 , 0.0 and 1.1 gyr @xcite are also overlayed .",
    "the range of the hb index and the metallicity dispersion of the sextans are shown by the horizontal and vertical lines centered on the position of the sextans .",
    "the sextans shows the largest deviation ( toward the lowest metallicity ) from the main group , while the sculptor is located within the main group as well as most galactic globular clusters . a metallicity increase by 0.30.4 dex is needed to put the sextans within the main group .",
    "if we extrapolate the isochrone to the lower metallicity end , the relative age of the sextans will be about 2 gyr , showing that it is about two gyr younger than the sculptor .",
    "however , this age difference is not consistent with the result from the main sequence age estimates ( i.e. the msto age of the sextans is similar to that of m92 ) . in this sense ,",
    "the sextans dsph is a peculiar dsph in the local group and it remains to be explained .",
    "here we present a schematic description of the star formation history of the sextans dsph using observational clues which are summarized in the final section .",
    "the majority of stars in the sextans were formed at the similar time to the age of metal - poor globular clusters like m92 , and they are very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = 2.1 dex ) . the metallicity spread ( @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath164 dex ) observed in the rgb , and the significant population gradients indicate that this star formation might have continued for a few gyr , which is also consistent with the presence of strong rhb and the presence of bright ms stars slightly above the msto of the main population ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a small amount of stars , including anomalous cepheids , were formed later about one gyr ago .",
    "we present deep wide field @xmath0 ccd photometry of the sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the local group , covering a field of @xmath1 located at the center of the galaxy ( supplemented by short @xmath2 photometry ) .",
    "these data allowed us to investigate in detail the properties of several stellar populations located in the wide region of the sextans dsph .",
    "primary results are summarized below .",
    "1 .   color - magnitude diagrams of the sextans dsph show well - defined rgb , bhb , prominent rhb , agb , about 120 variable stars including rr lyraes and anomalous cepheids , about 230 bss , and ms stars .",
    "the msto of the old population is found to be located at @xmath6 mag and @xmath7 .",
    "the distance to the galaxy is derived using the @xmath8-band magnitude of the tip of the rgb at @xmath8(trgb)@xmath9 : @xmath10 for an adopted reddening of @xmath11 .",
    "this estimate agrees well with the distance estimate based on the mean @xmath12-band magnitude of the hb at @xmath12(hb)@xmath13 4 .",
    "the mean metallicity of the rgb is estimated from the @xmath14 color at @xmath313 and 3.0 mag : [ fe / h]@xmath15(stat .",
    "error)@xmath16 ( standard calibration error ) dex , with a dispersion of @xmath17[fe / h]=0.2 dex .",
    "there is found to be one rgb bump at @xmath235 mag ( @xmath19 mag ) , and a weak brighter bump at @xmath198 mag(@xmath21 mag ) which is probably an agb bump .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude differences between the bumps and the hb are @xmath314 for the rgb bump , and 1.0 mag for the brighter agb bump .",
    "the @xmath12-band luminosity function of the bss in the inner region is found to extend to a brighter magnitude and to have a slightly flatter slope compared with that of the bss in the outer region .",
    "the bright bss are more strongly centrally concentrated than the faint bss .",
    "the faint bss are depleted in the central region and the spatial distribution of the faint bss is similar to that of the sgb stars .",
    "the bss in the sextans are probably old bss as seen in galactic globular clusters , rather than the intermediate - age ms stars .",
    "the @xmath12-band luminosity function of the rgb and ms stars in the sextans dsph is in general similar to that of the globular cluster m92 , with a slight excess of stars in the magnitude range brighter than the msto with respect to that of m92 .",
    "the age of the msto of the main population is estimated to be similar to that of the metal - poor galactic globular clusters like m92 , and there are seen some stellar populations with younger age .",
    "significant radial gradients are seen for several populations : the rhb , the red rgb , the red sgb , and the bright bss are more centrally concentrated toward the center of the galaxy , compared with the bhb , the blue rgb , the blue sgb , and the faint bs , respectively .",
