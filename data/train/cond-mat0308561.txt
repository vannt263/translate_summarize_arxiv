    "@xcite .",
    "perturbation expansions can only be used to calculate a physical quantity @xmath23 for very small values of the coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "we are usually able to find a truncated power series at some finite order @xmath24 : @xmath25 if @xmath8 is small enough , this can lead to an impressive agreement between theory and experiment , the most prominent example being the perturbation series for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath8 is necessary since the expansion ( [ pi ] ) has a zero radius of convergence , as pointed out by freeman dyson in 1952 @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath28 is the endpoint of a cut ( see fig .",
    "[ analytic ] ) which makes the expansion divergent , with only an asymptotic validity for @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between a convergent and an asymptotic series lies in the behavior of the last term @xmath30 of ( [ pi ] ) . for fixed @xmath8 ,",
    "a convergent series has decreasing @xmath30 , a typical divergent series of perturbation expansions has @xmath31 growing factorially , so that the last term @xmath30 decreases only at small @xmath8 for a few low orders , after which it increases dramatically .",
    "these divergent series require resummation if we want to extract from them reliable results . the crudest method to approximate @xmath23 is via pad approximants @xcite .",

    "the factorial growth of @xmath32 can be eliminated @xcite , and a pad approximation is applied .",
    "after this , one returns back to the original function by an inverse borel transform .",
    "this procedure can be improved further by a conformal mapping technique in which the complex @xmath8-plane is mapped into a unit circle which contains the original left - hand cut on its circumference @xcite .    a further simple tool for extracting physical results is provided by simple variational methods invented a long time ago by many research groups in quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , the so - called @xmath14-expansion amounts to a resummation of divergent perturbation series ( see , for instance , the references cited in @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on introducing artificially a harmonic trial oscillator and optimizing the trial frequency by invoking the principle of minimal sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath14-expansion procedure corresponds to a systematic extension of a variational approach in quantum statistics @xcite to arbitrary orders @xcite and is now called vpt .",
    "it allows us to evaluate the asymptotic series ( [ pi ] ) for all values of the coupling constant @xmath8 , even in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , is it possible to derive from the initial weak - coupling expansion ( [ pi ] ) a strong - coupling limit which has the generic form @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are real growth parameters characterizing the strong - coupling behavior .",
    "for the ground - state energy of the anharmonic oscillator with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the convergence was shown to be exponentially fast , even for infinite coupling strength @xcite .",
    "it also allows us to combine a weak - coupling expansion with information on the strong - coupling expansion and interpolate between them @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", vpt has been extended in a simple but essential way to become applicable to quantum field theory with its anomalous dimensions .",
    "applications to series expansions of @xmath39-theory have led to extremely accurate critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the field - theoretic perturbation coefficients are available up to six and partly to seven loops in @xmath40  @xcite , and up to five loops in @xmath41 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of this new field - theoretic vpt is that it accounts for the anomalous power approach to the strong - coupling limit which the @xmath14-expansion can not accommodate . as we see in eq .",
    "( [ sss ] ) , this approach is governed by an irrational critical exponent @xmath42 as was first shown by wegner @xcite in the context of critical phenomena .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath14-expansion , the field - theoretic variational perturbation expansions _ can not _ be derived from adding and subtracting a harmonic term in the underlying action .",
    "the wegner exponent @xmath43 is determined from ( [ pi ] ) by making the variationally resummed logarithmic derivative @xmath44 vanish at @xmath33 , as we have there @xmath45 .",

    "the disagreement is therefore no cause of worry .",
    "let us end by remarking that a nose in the phase diagram was also found in ref .",
    "the authors did not , however , take this phenomenon seriously but considered it as an artefact of their slave boson approach .",
    "in this article we have investigated the condensation of a homogeneous bose gas in the @xmath1@xmath2-plane .",
    "the result was obtained by applying vpt at two stages .",
    "first , we variationally resummed the popov approximation to the effective potential in order to reach the quantum phase transition .",
    "second , the lowest - order quantum phase diagram was variationally improved by taking into account recent results on the leading temperature shift for small scattering length @xmath1 .    finally , we mention that the self - consistent popov approximation is also applicable to becs trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "there the periodicity of the lattice leads to a quasi - free behavior due to bloch s theory which enables us to treat this system as effectively homogeneous @xcite . at @xmath22 ,",
    "this yields a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a mott insulator , in good agreement with recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts again a reentrant phenomenon in the quantum phase diagram which might be observed experimentally .",
    "the only problem is the need of a soft magnetic trap with frequency of the order of 10 hz which holds the atoms in the optical lattice .",
    "this could in principle destroy the reentrant transition , since the temperature shift in a trap is negative .",
    "it is not yet clear whether for very small trap frequency , there exists a crossover from negative to positive slope @xmath13 .",
    "we thank robert graham , franck lalo , and flavio nogueira for clarifying discussions as well as the priority program spp 1116 _ interactions in ultra - cold atomic and molecular gases _ of the german research foundation ( dfg ) for financial support .",
    "the research was also partially supported by the esf coslab program and by the dfg ( deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ) under grant kl-256 .",
    "one of us ( s.s . ) acknowledges support from the german national academic foundation .",
