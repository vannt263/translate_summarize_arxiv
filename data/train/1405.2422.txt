    "many ceramic and hybrid metal - organic framework materials show negative thermal expansion ( nte ) : they _ contract _ instead of expanding on heating  @xcite .",
    "their structures are invariably characterised as a network of polyhedral groups of atoms that are connected through sharing of corner atoms or by shared ligands . empirically",
    ", nte materials tend to show pressure - induced softening , pressure enhancement of nte , and the reduction of nte on heating .",
    "but such effects have only been investigated in a small number of materials @xcite , and as yet there is no general framework for understanding the whole suite of properties together .",
    "very recently we have seen a new emphasis on the role of anharmonic interactions in influencing the properties of nte materials .",
    "recently experimental and theoretical work on some simple materials , including scf@xmath0  @xcite , cu@xmath1o  @xcite and ag@xmath1o  @xcite , has suggested that the extent of nte at high temperature can only be understood on the basis of an important role for intrinsic phonon anharmonic interactions .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of simplified models of nte materials ( section ii ) in which the hamiltonians are chosen to reflect the physical picture generally accepted as responsible for nte in framework materials . in section",
    "iii we use these models in the quasi - harmonic approximation to demonstrate that nte , pressure - enhanced nte , and pressure - induced softening naturally emerge together . finally , in section iv , we show how including anharmonic interactions in these models leads to structural warm hardening  something that has only previously been seen in laser - excited warm - dense matter  @xcite and sc@xmath2y@xmath3f@xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) solid solution  @xcite  as well as to the transition from nte to positive thermal expansion and the disappearing of the pressure - induced softening at high temperatures .",
    "we present here two simple one - dimensional models designed to capture the essential physics and chemistry of nte in ceramic and metal - organic framework ( mof ) materials .",
    "these materials consist of metal atoms , which we denote by * m * , connected by one or more linking atoms that we denote by * x*. their nte behaviour is typically explained in terms of the transverse vibrations of the * x * atoms , which , because of tight bonds to their * m * neighbours , pull the * m * atoms towards one another  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is generally most favourable for the coordination polyhedron surrounding each * m * atom to rotate as a rigid unit  @xcite so that most of the flexing of the framework occurs about the * x * atoms . to capture this physics",
    ", our model hamiltonian must contain three components : strong penalties for distorting both ( 1 ) nearest - neighbour bonds and ( 2 ) coordination polyhedra , as well as ( 3 ) a weaker penalty for flexing about other points of the chain .",
    "we will construct two such hamiltonians : one to describe ceramics , in which neighbouring metal atoms are connected by a single * x * atom ( typically representing oxygen ) , and one to describe mofs , in which neighbouring metal atoms are connected by a pair of * x * atoms representing a rigid molecular linker . by design ,",
    "these models include the minimum possible description of the mechanism for nte in broad classes of ceramic and mof materials , with the intention to demonstrate that the concomitantly observed physical properties do not arise by coincidence , but rather emerge naturally from the same hamiltonian .",
    "consider first ceramic materials ; examples with nte include zrw@xmath1o@xmath5 @xcite , zrv@xmath1o@xmath6 @xcite , sc@xmath1w@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite , cu@xmath1o @xcite , scf@xmath0 @xcite , quartz and a number of zeolites @xcite .",
    "we model these materials as a chain of equally - spaced , alternating * m * and * x * atoms , with bond length @xmath8 and lattice parameter @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    "we allow the atoms to move only transverse to the chain , with displacements of the * x * and * m * atoms denoted respectively by @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 indexes the unit cell .",
    "the lattice strain is denoted by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the equilibrium lattice parameter when the atoms are at rest .",
    "the three terms in the hamiltonian corresponding to the discussion above are as follows .",
    "the first term describes the energy cost of changing the length of the * m**x * bonds , @xmath8 , due to both atomic displacements and elastic strain : @xmath16 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the second energy term reflects the energy cost of distorting an * * mx**@xmath1 polyhedron through bending the * x  m  x * bond : @xmath19 finally , the third term provides weaker resistance against _ any _ relative displacements of neighbouring atoms : @xmath20.\\ ] ]    picturing the * * mx**@xmath1 unit as mechanically rigid , it is instructive to analyse this system in terms of its rigid unit modes ( rums ) . following the analysis of ref .  , the * * mx**@xmath1 unit will have two degrees of freedom ",
    "one rotation and one translation  and one constraint per unit , meaning that there will be one rum at each wave vector .",
    "the system will have two branches in its phonon dispersion curve , with the rum corresponding to the acoustic mode .",
    "the first two energy terms will give exactly zero frequency for each rum ; the third term provides some resistance against these distortions .",
    "we now adapt this to form an analogous model representing a hybrid mof system , such as zn(cn)@xmath1 , cd(cn)@xmath1 and related materials @xcite as well as a wide range of hybrid mofs @xcite .        in this model the * x**x *",

    "stripped down to interactions along a one - dimensional chain and with one transverse degree of freedom per atom , whilst maintaining a three - dimensional nature of the interatomic interactions , makes for an easier and more transparent analysis .",
    "in particular , we reduce the number of irrelevant degrees of freedom , and we reduce the number of parameters required to define a realistic model .",
    "there are two main effects from working with a one - dimensional topology .",
    "the first is on the value of the pressure - derivative of the bulk modulus at zero temperature .",

    "a one - dimensional topology with a harmonic potential gives @xmath51 .",
    "second is the effect on the phonon density of states , which will have a constant value at low @xmath52 rather than varying as @xmath53 .",
    "this will lead , for example , to the heat capacity at low temperature varying as @xmath54 rather than @xmath55 at low temperature .",

    "note that @xmath62 of the hybrid model is less than 3 since the high - frequency optic branch is not significantly populated at these temperatures.,width=302 ]",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath63 of the two models was calculated in analytical form in the quasi - harmonic approximation @xcite , from which pressure , bulk modulus , the pressure derivative of bulk modulus , heat capacity , and the coefficient of thermal expansion were derived using standard thermodynamic relations : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the quantities were computed self - consistently for two pressures and a range of temperatures , and are shown in figure [ quasimodel ] , together with the overall grneisen parameter @xmath57 defined as the weighted average of the individual @xmath69 values .",
    "the results shown in the figures were obtained from self - consistent calculations using scripts written for matlab .",
    "the values of parameters of the models here were chosen in part to give phonon frequencies and values of physical properties comparable to known nte materials , but also to ensure that the variations in frequencies can be seen on the same graphs .",
    "the force constants for the ceramic model were @xmath70  ev@xmath71 and @xmath72  ev@xmath71 ; for the hybrid model @xmath73  ev@xmath71 , @xmath74  ev@xmath71 , and @xmath72  ev@xmath71 .",
    "we set all mass values to @xmath75  gmol@xmath76 ; the effect of changing the masses can be reproduced by corresponding changes in the force constants .",
    "we set @xmath77 for convenience for plotting in figures [ phonons ] and [ quasimodel ] ; in reality , as discussed in the introduction , it is more likely that @xmath78 , because @xmath79 will represent the energy associated with bending bonds within a quasi - rigid polyhedral group of atoms , and @xmath80 will represent the energy associated with bending the angles at the shared apex or via a shared ligand .",
    "the standard grneisen quasi - harmonic formulation gives @xmath81 .",
    "the value of @xmath57 becomes slightly less negative at higher temperatures ( figure [ quasimodel ] ) because of the contributions of the higher - frequency modes , which are more populated at higher temperatures but have smaller values of @xmath69 .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath58 decreases on heating .",
    "its temperature dependence in the high - temperature limit ( when @xmath82 ) can be derived from the analytical form of @xmath63 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the lattice energy .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath58 in figure [ quasimodel ] is mostly due to the factor of @xmath87 . in turn",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath58 dominates the temperature dependence of @xmath56 in the quasi - harmonic approximation , making it more negative at higher temperature .",
    "we discuss this later in this paper .",
    "figure [ quasimodel ] shows that @xmath56 also becomes more negative at higher pressure .",
    "this can be directly linked both to the larger negative value of @xmath57 and to the decrease of @xmath58 with pressure seen in figure [ quasimodel ] , and is consistent with the thermodynamic relation @xmath88 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath58 with pressure seen in figure [ quasimodel]the phenomenon called _ pressure - induced softening _",
    "@xcite  is shown by the negative value of @xmath59 . in the high - temperature limit",
    "we can write an equation for @xmath59 : @xmath89 the first term has a value of @xmath90 in one dimension , with corresponding values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 in two and three dimensions respectively from thermodynamic relations ( see ` methods ' ) .",
    "writing the mode frequencies in approximate form @xmath93 and noting that the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 always have positive values in both models , we find @xmath96 thus , @xmath57 and its first and second pressure derivatives will also be negative .",
    "the contribution from these terms to the value of @xmath59 can prevail on heating as shown by equation [ dbulk_hight ] .",
    "this demonstrates that a negative @xmath59 is inevitable consequence of nte in this model , which has been hypothesised but not previously justified theoretically  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model shows that @xmath59 must become more negative on compression due to the softening of both the vibration modes and the bulk modulus under pressure ( figures [ phonons ] and [ quasimodel ] and equation  [ gamma_derivative ] ) .",
    "the preceding discussion around equation [ dbulk_hight ] also shows that the value of @xmath59 will become more negative on heating , and this is confirmed by figure [ quasimodel ] . for three - dimensional systems",
    "it might be expected that @xmath59 will have a positive value at zero temperature  @xcite , with a slight reduction due to zero - point motions ( although there is no constraint that this should be negative ) .",
    "but the vibrational contribution to @xmath59 on heating is negative and will become more dominant , eventually making @xmath59 negative , regardless of dimension .",
    "thus we predict from our model that nte materials will have a characteristic variation of @xmath59 with temperature , and this has in fact been observed in zeolites  @xcite and zn(cn)@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is the case that in real three - dimensional systems there will be contributions from a large number of vibrational modes with positive grneisen parameters .",
    "the analysis presented above will hold provided the nte phonons are more strongly weighted in the overall grneisen parameter @xmath57",
    ". this will be the case if the frequencies of the nte phonons are low . in our model",
    ", this specifically means the lowest - frequency modes , whose values are determined by the value of @xmath97 ( equation [ potential_3 ] ) .",
    "whilst our models show that both @xmath56 and @xmath59 continue to decrease on increasing temperature , albeit changing less at high temperatures , this is actually different from what is normally seen in nte materials , where both quantities become less negative on heating @xcite .",
    "this indicates an insufficiency of the quasi - harmonic model as defined so far , and has to be tackled by including the effects of mode anharmonicity .",
    "an anharmonic model was built by considering an explicit temperature dependence of phonon frequencies , using the standard approach for phonon  phonon interactions that underpins the soft - mode theory of displacive phase transitions@xcite .",
    "this leads to a renormalisation of the phonon frequency : @xmath98\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the coupling factor measuring the phonon - phonon interactions .",
    "the sum is over all modes except the one with zero frequency .",
    "we set @xmath100 , which strictly holds for the important acoustic branch .",
    "we have defined @xmath101 as a measure of the magnitude of the intrinsic anharmonicity ; @xmath102 is the temperature beyond which the mode frequency starts to _ increase _ on compression .",
    "since the transverse acoustic modes at @xmath103 and @xmath104 are found to have smaller @xmath95 compared to the optic ones , these modes will have smaller @xmath102hence anharmonic effects will be more important at any given temperature  compared to the optic modes in this model .",
    "this is consistent with what has been seen in real nte materials  @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we use a uniform value of @xmath105 for all vibrational modes .",
    "apart from added simplicity , this is expected to better simulate the case of a three - dimensional material , where there are more optic modes and hence more contribution to the overall anharmonicity from the optic modes than in the one - dimensional model , where the relative contribution to the anharmonicity from the acoustic modes is higher .",
    "figure  [ anharmmodel ] shows @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 recalculated for both ceramic and hybrid models including the anharmonic terms with different values of @xmath105 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath56 is determined by the fact that the renormalised mode frequencies ( equation  [ freq_anharm ] ) are stiffened on heating , leading to renormalised values of mode grneisen parameters @xmath106    thus , according to equations  [ freq_anharm ] and  [ renormgrun ] , at @xmath107 , @xmath108 becomes independent of @xmath13 and @xmath109 becomes zero , leading to zero overall grneisen parameter hence zero @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath110 , the coefficient of @xmath13 in the renormalised frequency becomes negative and @xmath109 is positive , resulting in positive overall grneisen parameter hence positive @xmath56 .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 at zero pressure for the ceramic ( left panel ) and the hybrid ( right panel ) models . in each case",
    "curves decrease in anharmonicity from top to bottom ( solid to short - dotted curves ) , with @xmath111  k respectively , showing the trend to approach quasi - harmonic results from the anharmonic model . at @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and for @xmath110",
    "the models show positive thermal expansion.,width=302 ]    in addition to anharmonicity , the other reason for the reduction of nte on heating is the population of high - energy modes with positive mode grneisen parameters .",
    "the relative contributions of these two effects can be estimated by the extent to which quasiharmonic calculations of @xmath114 from lattice dynamics calculations reproduce the experimental data . on this basis , by comparing to the curves of different cases of anharmonicity in figure  [ anharmmodel ] , we found that reo@xmath0  @xcite , cu@xmath1o  @xcite , and scf@xmath0 @xcite correspond to cases of strong anharmonic effects , while examples of weaker anharmonicity are zn(cn)@xmath1 @xcite and mof-5 @xcite .",
    "these examples empirically suggest that anharmonicity is likely to be more important in ceramic systems than mof systems in general : indeed , since mofs will have more atoms in the unit cell and hence more phonon modes than ceramics , it might be expected that the higher - frequency modes are more likely to be significantly populated in these systems , compared to ceramics , at temperatures where anharmonicity remains negligible .    in the recently reported case of ag@xmath1o , @xmath114 acts like the strong anharmonic case in figure  [ anharmmodel ] but starts to become more negative at temperatures @xmath115 k  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour suggests a negative coupling factor @xmath116 , hence negative @xmath102 for some high - energy modes in equation  [ freq_anharm ] . according to equation  [ renormgrun ] , with elevated temperature",
    ", @xmath109 of these modes will become more negative and will contribute more to the overall grneisen parameter when the modes are more occupied .",
    "this will in turn begin to enhance the nte at relatively high temperatures , exactly as seen in the temperature - dependent behaviour of @xmath114 in ag@xmath1o  @xcite .    with high anharmonicity the value of @xmath58 will initially decrease on heating but then quickly start to increase , only decreasing again when @xmath110 ( figure [ anharmmodel ] ) .",
    "the prediction of the counterintuitive increase of @xmath58 upon heating which corresponds to warm hardening of the structure has recently been demonstrated in sc@xmath2y@xmath3f@xmath0@xcite . for weaker anharmonicity",
    ", @xmath58 will only decrease on heating as for the quasi - harmonic model .",
    "comparing figures [ quasimodel ] and [ anharmmodel ] it can be seen that the effect of anharmonicity is to increase ( _ i.e. _ , make less negative ) the value of @xmath59 at higher temperature . for weaker",
    "anharmonicity , the value of @xmath59 will reach a minimum at higher @xmath54 , and thereafter tend towards zero on heating .",
    "this effect has been seen in cubic nte zeolites @xcite and zn(cn)@xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand , with very large",
    "anharmonicity @xmath59 increases with temperature beyond @xmath105 , as seen in materials with positive thermal expansion  @xcite , and in a three - dimensional system will not have a negative value .",
    "this has been observed in scf@xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath56 becomes positive around @xmath117 k @xcite , and corresponds to the case shown as the solid line in the left panel of figure [ anharmmodel ] .",
    "in summary , we have investigated simple models designed to mimic the essential features of many ceramic and hybrid nte systems , particularly taking account of the role of transverse vibrations of bridging atoms and recognising that often bridging atoms are part of a stiff polyhedral group of atoms .",
    "we have shown that pressure - induced softening will in many cases be an inevitable consequence of nte . moreover ,",
    "the model shows how nte , elastic stiffness and pressure - induced softening will vary with both temperature and pressure .",
    "we have also shown how the basic picture is modified by intrinsic anharmonic interactions beyond those captured in the quasiharmonic model of nte .",
    "in particular , both the nte and pressure - induced softening are weakened at high temperature due to anharmonic interactions , and the same interactions lead to warm hardening .",
    "the objective of studying these models has been to provide a framework in which both nte and pressure - induced softening can be understood as arising from a common mechanical origin , something that has previously been hinted at but not explicitly demonstrated .",
    "we hope that these models will prompt further experimental investigation of the links between these properties in real materials .",
