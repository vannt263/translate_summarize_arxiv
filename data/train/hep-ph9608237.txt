    "the ( meta- ) stability of strange quark matter as suggested by several authors @xcite has spurred theoretical as well as experimental activities aimed at answering the question of whether strange quark matter already exists in nature ( _ e.g _ , in the cores of neutron stars or in cosmic rays ) or can be produced in a laboratory ( most likely in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ) .",
    "it is not an easy question to answer with our present theoretical tools , since it involves non - perturbative aspects of the strong interaction . precisely for this reason",
    "most of the theoretical work has been done using different phenomenological models .",
    "ultimately the question of the stability of strange quark matter will have to be answered experimentally / observationally , _ e.g _",
    ", by the detection of strangelets in heavy ion collisions .",
    "strangelet production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions would also constitute an unambiguous signal of quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "while not making specific predictions for the outcome of an experiment here , we do try to address some of the points which are believed to be important for experimental strangelet searches .",
    "these are the effects of small system size and the fact that the produced strangelet is not born cold , but has to survive the hot environment ensuing the collision of two heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition to the added thermal energy , which in itself results in an increase of strangelet masses , there is a more subtle effect , _ viz .",
    "_ the fact that the strangelet must be color singlet .",
    "we have used the mit bag model @xcite to describe a strangelet as an ideal fermi gas of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks ( and also antiquarks and gluons at finite temperature ) .",
    "we use a density of states derived using the multiple relection expansion @xcite which gives corrections due to the finite system size .",
    "this is the liquid drop model of strangelets , similar to the liquid drop model of nuclei .",
    "the overall effects of the shells are well described by the liquid drop model , whereas the detailed effects of the shells , such as shell closures , which are likely to be important at very low baryon number are not revealed in the liquid drop model .",
    "however , recent results @xcite indicate that shell effects are washed out at elevated temperatures , making shell model calculations and liquid drop calculations effectively equivalent .",
    "the main advantage of the liquid drop model over the shell model is that many quantities can be evaluated analytically .",
    "some of the results presented here are described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only massless quarks were treated .",
    "we first consider strangelets at non - zero temperatures without inclusion of the color - singlet constraint . in this case",
    "we can obtain all relevant information from the grand canonical partition function @xmath3 of a noninteracting gas of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons at temperature @xmath4 in an mit bag of volume @xmath5 @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the partition function for particle species @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the bag constant , which is the energy density of the perturbative vacuum inside the bag .",

    "@xmath11 is the statistical weight due to the spin ( helicity ) and color degrees of freedom , @xmath12 is the energy of a particle with momentum @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the chemical potential .",
    "we use units in which @xmath15 .",
    "the density of states @xmath16 is a smooth function of @xmath13 calculated in the framework of the multiple reflection expansion @xcite .",
    "it has the general form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the surface area of the bag , and @xmath19 is the extrinsic curvature of the bag surface ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the principal radii of curvature ) . the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend on the equations of motion and on the boundary conditions , but _ not _ on the geometry of the confining surface , which is only assumed to be smooth .",
    "the surface coefficient for a quark field in a cavity with confining mit bag boundary conditions is @xcite @xmath24 note that this expression vanishes in the limit @xmath25 , so that massless quarks do not contribute to the surface tension .",
    "so for massless ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) quarks the lowest order correction to the density of states is the curvature term .",
    "the curvature coefficient @xmath23 has not been calculated using the multiple reflection expansion in the general case of massive quarks , but for massless quarks with mit bag boundary conditions the result is @xcite @xmath26 . in the limit of infinite mass",
    "the quark can be considered non - relativistic and the field equation reduces to the wave equation . in this case",
    "the boundary condition of the mit bag is the well known dirichlet boundary condition studied by balian and bloch @xcite who derive the result @xmath27 .",
    "it was shown by madsen @xcite that the expression @xmath28,\\ ] ] which has the above special cases as limits , is in very good agreement with shell model calculations ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : energy ] ) . we will therefore adopt ( [ eq : curvature ] ) as the curvature coefficient for quarks . for gluons",
    "the relevant expressions were given by mardor and svetitsky @xcite @xmath29 just as massless quarks , gluons do not contribute to the surface tension .",
    "it is possible to calculate the thermodynamical potential @xmath30 without resorting to numerical evaluation in the two limits : @xmath31 and @xmath25 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the finite temperature regime we will give the result for @xmath32 massless quark flavors , including antiquarks and gluons , and assuming a common chemical potential @xmath33 of all quarks ( antiquarks have @xmath34 ) @xmath35 v      \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{{\\cal n}_q}{24 } + \\frac{4}{9 } \\right )      t^2   + \\frac{{\\cal n}_q}{8\\pi^2}\\mu_q^2 \\right ] c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we consider only spherical systems , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given in terms of the radius @xmath38 .",
    "when fixing the geometry in this manner there is only one independent `` shape variable '' which we will take to be the volume .",
    "a strangelet is in mechanical equilibrium when @xmath39 .",
    "the chemical potential and the temperature are determined by requiring the baryon number @xmath40 and the entropy per baryon @xmath41 to be fixed .",
    "so to find the equilibrium values of @xmath42 , @xmath33 and @xmath5 we simultaneously solve the equations @xmath43 the energy ( mass ) @xmath44 of the strangelet can then be calculated by use of the identity @xmath45 as long as only massless quarks are considered this is equivalent to the expression @xmath46 _ in equilibrium_. this is because massless particles satisfy the relativistic equation of state @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the pressure . in equilibrium the dynamic pressure of the particles is exactly balanced by the bag constant @xmath49 , so that adding the vacuum energy @xmath50 gives @xmath51 . including a massive strange quark this no longer holds .",

    "it is necessary to introduce chemical potentials related to the color degree of freedom of the quarks and gluons .",
    "two chemical potentials , corresponding to the two conserved charges ( cartan operators ) of @xmath52 , are needed .",

    "it is possible to construct a canonical partition function ( with respect to color ) from the grand canonical @xmath57 constructed using the prescription just outlined .",
    "the resulting color - singlet canonical partition function is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the haar measure of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the chemical potentials @xmath60 are now purely imaginary .",
    "the baryon number is still treated in a grand canonical ensemble , so @xmath61 is a mixed canonical / grand canonical ensemble .    in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath62 ) the two ensembles are equivalent , _",
    "i.e. _ , they give identical mean values  differing only with respect to fluctuations . for a finite system",
    "this is no longer the case , and since color neutrality is exact at all times the canonical prescription is the proper one .    for massless quarks it is possible to evaluate @xmath61 analytically in a saddle - point approximation , valid at high @xmath42 and/or @xmath33 .",

    "the limit @xmath66 can not be taken in the above expression for @xmath64 , since the saddle - point approximation breaks down for low @xmath42 .",
    "but for @xmath66 the effect of exact color singletness also disappears since at @xmath67 it is always possible to construct a color singlet state for @xmath68 quarks occupying the lowest energy levels available . for massive quarks",
    "we evaluate the partition function numerically .",
    "the effect of the color singlet constraint on the energy per baryon is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , where dashed lines include the color singlet constraint .",
    "there is a sizeable effect regardless of whether one includes a massive strange quark or not .",
    "the main effect of the strange quark mass is to shift curves towards higher @xmath69 .",
    "curves for zero strange quark mass are calculated using the saddle - point approximation , which has been shown to be a good approximation in this case ( see ref .",
    "as another example of the effect of color singletness we consider the nucleation of quark matter droplets from hadronic matter using standard homogenous nucleation theory .",
    "the low baryon number density region of the phase diagram is where the transition to a quark - gluon plasma would happen in rhic and lhc experiments . in the region of the phase diagram characterized by high baryon number density and moderate temperature",
    "this could be relevant for the nucleation of quark matter droplets in ags experiments and in the core of neutron stars . in the case of neutron",
    "stars the time scales are probably sufficently large for homogenous nucleation theory to be applicable , whereas this is questionable in the case of quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "an estimate for the nucleation rate is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the height of the free energy barrier that has to be surmounted by the nucleated bubble . for the prefactor we have chosen the dimensional estimate @xmath72 .",
    "one could consider improvements to this estimate but since the relative suppression due to color singlet effects are dominated by the exponential , this is unlikely to change the results significantly .",
    "the free energy barrier is given by the pressure difference between the hadronic phase and the plasma phase ( times volume ) plus additional contributions from surface tension and the curvature term .",
    "@xmath73 note that any contribution from the hadronic phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , either a non - zero pressure or a surface tension , will increase the barrier height .",
    "we will therefore ignore the hadron gas contribution , since it will only augment the effect due to color singletness ( for a more elaborate discussion of this point , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with this simplification",
    "the free energy barrier is simply @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is given by eq .",

    "the color singlet constraint is taken into account by using @xmath77 as given by eqs .",

    "= 0.48 = 0.48    inserting the value of @xmath71 for a critical bubble in the expression ( [ eq : rate ] ) for a range in temperature and chemical potential gives a plot like the one shown in the right panel of fig .",
