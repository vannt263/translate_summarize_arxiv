    "observations of molecular clouds at millimeter wavelengths show that they often have systematic velocity gradients . if , as many authors have argued , these velocity gradients are indicative of cloud rotation ( e.g. , kutner et al .",
    "1977 ; blitz 1993 ; rosolowsky et al .",
    "2003 ) , then angular momentum conservation should contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "significant progress was made in this direction when rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the angular momentum properties of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in m33 .",
    "their measurements , based on high - resolution ( @xmath5 ) observations , showed that m33 molecular clouds have velocity gradient magnitudes that are comparable to milky way gmcs ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they found that typical gradients of the gmcs are 5 to 10 times smaller than would be expected from simple formation theories .",
    "furthermore , just as galactic gmcs are sometimes observed with gradients that are not parallel to the sense of galactic rotation ( e.g. , blitz 1993 ; phillips 1999 ; imara & blitz 2010 ) , rosolowsky et al . ( 2003 ) found that the gradient directions of m33 gmcs are often not in alignment with the galaxy rotation .",
    "this is the so - called `` angular momentum problem '' of gmc formation .",
    "it is our goal in this paper to address the question of the origin of velocity gradients in gmcs by doing a detailed analysis of the gradients in the atomic gas associated with the m33 molecular clouds catalogued by rosolowsky et al .",
    "this paper is an extension of our study in the milky way ( imara & blitz 2010 , henceforth paper i ) in which we compared the velocity fields of gmcs to those of the local atomic gas surrounding them .",
    "our study is prompted , in part , by observations in external galaxies showing that high - density @xmath0  appears to be a necesssary but not sufficient condition of gmc formation ( e.g. , mizuno et al . 2001 ; engargiola et al .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that the discrepancy between observations and theoretical expectations in gmc angular momentum arises because angular momentum has been redistributed or `` shed '' during the course of gmc evolution ( mouschovias & paleologou 1979 ; mestel & paris 1984 ; rosolowsky et al .",
    "2003 , kim et al .",
    "it seems reasonable , then , to look for evidence of this redistribution in the immediate environs of gmcs . and",
    "thus , we are motivated to search for clues to the angular momentum problem by comparing the velocity fields in gmcs to those of the atomic gas with which they are associated . whereas rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) make inferences about the @xmath0  velocity field from the m33 rotation curve , in this study , we take measurements of the gradients in the atomic gas associated with the gmcs directly from observations .    in the next section , we describe the observations used to perform this analysis . in  [ sec : properties ] , we provide the methodology and discuss the properties of atomic gas surrounding molecular clouds in m33 .",
    "implications for gmc formation and evolution are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , and the results are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the data for the m33 molecular clouds are obtained from the rosolowsky et al .",

    "their work was a high - resolution continuation to the engargiola et al .",
    "( 2003 ) survey of 148 gmcs .",
    "rosolowsky et al .",
    "observed 17 fields of the highest - mass clouds from their previous study in ( @xmath5 ) using the c configuration of the bima array ( welch et al .",
    "1996 ) in the fall of 2000 and spring of 2001 .",
    "the @xmath7 resolution of the observations , corresponding to a linear resolution of 20 pc , was sufficiently high to resolve most gmcs and measure their sizes , which was done using the prescription of rosolowsky & leroy ( 2006 ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution , in combination with the velocity resolution of 2 , also allowed them to determine velocity gradients as small as @xmath8  in the gmcs .",
    "the magnitudes and directions of the gradients measured by rosolowsky et al . are listed in table 1 .",
    "observations of the 21-cm line in m33 were taken from vla archives and reduced by schruba ( a. schruba & a. leroy , priv .",
    "comm . ) . the data , taken by thilker et al . in 1997 , where first described by thilker et al .",
    "we converted the data cube from units of flux density ( @xmath9 ) to brightness temperature ( @xmath10 ) via the rayleigh - jeans relation , @xmath11 where @xmath9 is in jy , @xmath12 cm is the observing wavelength , and @xmath13 is the synthesized beam size in arcseconds .",
    "the final map has @xmath14 pixels .",
    "the lsr velocity range covered was @xmath15 to @xmath16  with @xmath17  channel spacing , which was sufficient to include all of the gas in the disk of m33 .",
    "in order to compare the velocity gradients of molecular clouds with the gradients of the material from which they formed , we develop a set of criteria for selecting regions of atomic gas that are associated with the gmcs in our sample .",
    "the challenge is to determine _ physically meaningful _ boundaries of atomic gas surrounding a given molecular cloud .",
    "thus , for each gmc , we begin by isolating subcubes in the vla 21-cm data set that coincide with the gmcs kinematically and spatially",
    ". properties of the molecular clouds and the regions surrounding them are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use a distance to m33 of 850 kpc for this analysis ( kennicutt 1998 ) , and we assume a galactic inclination of @xmath18 ( corbelli & salucci 2000 ) when calculating the gas surface densities .",
    "molecular clouds have well - defined boundaries at which a phase transition occurs between the molecular and atomic gas and , thus , they generally have well - defined dimensions and masses ( e.g. , kutner et al .",
    "1977 ; blitz & thaddeus 1980 ; blitz 1993 ) . the neutral gas associated with gmcs",
    ", however , does not have such distinct edges but rather has slower , more gradual transitions from high- to low - surface density material . in trying to determine appropriate boundaries for @xmath0  associated with gmcs , therefore",
    ", our challenge is to define regions that are large enough so that most of the @xmath0  belonging to a given system is included , and yet the regions must be centered close enough to the gmcs so that the associations are physically meaningful and we do not include too much unrelated material .",
    "there are a number of properties of @xmath0  and gmcs observed both in the milky way and m33 that help us develop our selection criteria .",
    "first , an @xmath0  peak is typically found to have a velocity distribution which may be approximated by a gaussian and whose line center falls near the co line center of the affiliated molecular cloud ( andersson et al .",
    "1991 ; engargiola et al .",
    "we assume that the atomic gas associated with a given gmc will be at approximately the same velocity as the gmc , within the limits set by the velocity dispersion inherent to the atomic gas .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of the @xmath0  gas is several times larger than that of the co , we select velocities falling within @xmath19  of the co line center , so that we include as much emission as possible from the atomic gas associated with a given gmc .",
    "we decide to select from a wider range of velocities than the previous study ( i.e. , chapter 2 ) because the work of engargiola et al .",
    "( 2003 ) shows that the @xmath0  associated with gmcs in m33 has emission extending as much as @xmath20  from the line center of the co emission . and because m33 has a moderate inclination ( @xmath21 ; corbelli & salucci ) , the problem of source confusion is minimized , allowing us to select a more generous range of velocities . changing",
    "the range of velocities by a 5  10  does not significantly change the results .",
    "this is because the velocity maps we create are weighted by the intensity ( see  [ subsec : gradients ] ) , so low - level emission occurring near the wings of the spectra does not make significant contributions to the velocity maps nor , therefore , to the measurement of the velocity gradients .",
    "identifying appropriate spatial boundaries is less clear - cut .",
    "figure [ fig : m33 ] shows that in m33 , there is a spatial correspondence between gmcs and over - dense @xmath0  filaments .",
    "the radial accumulation length , @xmath22 , can give us an idea of the extent of the atomic gas associated with gmcs .",
    "the size of an area which collapses to form a molecular cloud , @xmath22 , can be estimated by requiring that the total @xmath0  mass in the region be equal to the observed mass of the cloud .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath22 is determined by assuming that the initial configuration of atomic gas is a cylinder stretching to infinity in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average local surface density of atomic hydrogen , measured from the 21-cm data .",
    "we estimate @xmath24 for different sized regions centered on the gmcs .",
    "the mean value of @xmath24 spans a narrow range of values for regions having a size of @xmath25 pc . within 150",
    "pc of molecular clouds , @xmath24 is 8.8 ; within 50 pc the average surface density is 11.5 .",
    "figure [ fig : surf_mass ] plots the mean @xmath0  surface density within 70 pc of gmcs versus gmc mass .",
    "the figure shows that as gmc mass increases , the surface density of associated @xmath0  ( and therefore @xmath0  mass ) slowly increases as @xmath26 .",
    "we find that the average @xmath0  surface density in the vicinity of gmcs is roughly 10 .",
    "this is the saturation level of atomic gas , observed in other spiral galaxies including the milky way , above which gas becomes primarily molecular ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ; wong & blitz 2002 ; bigiel et al .",
    "we calculate @xmath22 for the slightly different estimates of @xmath24 and find a mean value of @xmath27 pc .",
    "thus , we define @xmath0  regions in the 21-cm data cube as 140 pc @xmath28 140 pc @xmath28 50  connected regions that are centered on the locations of gmcs in position and velocity space .",
    "note that the area defined by the accumulation radius of a gmc contains gas which has filled in the space previously occupied by that which formed the gmc .",
    "we briefly note that defining @xmath0  associated with gmcs by identifying contiguous regions in position - velocity space above a given temperature threshold would not have been appropriate for our purposes .",
    "given that the @xmath0  has such a diffuse distribution compared to the molecular gas bound in gmcs , it is unclear what such a threshold should be .",
    "even if we were to define @xmath0  clouds using this method , we would still be left with the problem of deciding which clouds in the vicinity of a given gmc were associated with the said gmc and which which were not . based on this rationale ,",
    "we find it much more suitable to identify @xmath0  regions using the accumulation radius analysis described above .",
    "the top - right panels of figures [ fig : grad1 ]  [ fig : grad6 ] show surface density maps of the @xmath0  surrounding six of the 45 gmcs in this study .",
    "the bottom - right plot displays the average and @xmath0  spectra toward the clouds .",
    "( the left - hand panels are described in  [ subsec : gradients ] . )",
    "based on the spatial and kinematic proximity of gmcs to local maxima in the atomic gas , we observe three rough `` classes '' of clouds .",
    "most gmcs in the catalog are spatially and kinematically coincident with local @xmath0  maxima .",
    "clouds 1 , 4 , 39 , and 45 are representative examples  at least @xmath29 of the area of the molecular cloud coincides with a local peak in the atomic gas .",
    "twenty - nine out of 45 the gmcs , @xmath30 , fall into this class .",
    "the average gmc mass in this class is @xmath31 @xmath32 , with a dispersion of 80% .",
    "another group of clouds is kinematically but not quite spatially coincident with @xmath0  maxima .",
    "gmcs in this class , including clouds 16 , 24 ( figure [ fig : grad4 ] ) , 35 , and 44 are located near the edge of a bright @xmath0  peak or sit on a filament between two peaks .",
    "the thirteen ( @xmath33 ) molecular clouds belonging to this class tend to have their mean lsr velocities offset from the mean @xmath0  velocity by a few .",
    "the typical gmc mass in this second class is nearly 3 times smaller than in the first : @xmath34 @xmath32 , with a dispersion of 30% .",
    "at least two gmcs in the catalog , clouds 13 ( figure [ fig : grad3 ] ) and 38 , are not associated with any local @xmath0  maximum . for both of these clouds ,",
    "the center of the gmc is roughly 60 pc from the nearest peak in @xmath0  surface density , and the central velocity of the molecular and atomic clouds differ by at least 10 . at @xmath35 @xmath32 , the total mass ( molecular and atomic ) in the region surrounding cloud 13",
    "is among the lowest in this study ; only four other regions have less total mass , including clouds 7 , 8 , 9 , and 43 .",
    "cloud 38 does not appear to have any other characteristics , such as mass or size , that distinguishes it from others in the catalog .",
    "the one other case in which the there are no @xmath0  peaks in the vicinity of the molecular cloud may be cloud 43 .",
    "it has the lowest mass of the sample , and it is one of three gmcs farthest from the galactic center .",

    "the slope of the position - velocity plot and the uncertainty in the least - squares fit of the slope , @xmath50 , are calculated for each gradient individually and are indicated in the figures ; the ratio of these parameters is listed in tables 1 and 2 .    based on examination of the first moment maps and the position - velocity plots , we set the following criteria for degree of linearity in the gradients . regions of @xmath0  having position - velocity plots @xmath51 @xmath50 have non - linear , random velocity fields .",

    "the average gradient observed in non - gmc @xmath0  is @xmath46 .",
    "many authors have argued that the linear velocity gradients observed in molecular clouds are caused by rotation ( e.g. , kutner et al .",
    "1977 ; blitz 1993 ; phillips 1999 ) . if this is the case , the velocity gradient magnitude of a cloud is a measure of its angular speed and the gradient direction , @xmath56 , is perpendicular to its spin axis .",
    "figure [ fig : m33_hist2 ] demonstrates that 53% of gmcs have position angles that differ from the those measured in the surrounding atomic gas by more than @xmath48 .",
    "thus , if the molecular clouds are rotating , slightly more than half of the clouds are counter - rotating with respect to the atomic gas with which they are surrounded .",
    "rosolowsky et al . ( 2003 ) show that for a galactic kinematic position angle of @xmath57 , gmcs are preferentially aligned with the galaxy and approximately @xmath58 are retrograde rotators .",
    "we find that localized regions of @xmath0both with gmcs and not observed to contain gmcs  have gradient directions that are generally _ unaligned _ with respect to the galactic axis .",

    "this is not surprising , since for neigboring gmcs we are taking measurements in overlapping regions of atomic gas .",

    "assuming that molecular clouds are rotating , measurements of their angular momentum may reveal information about their past .",
    "the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath71 , is a useful quantity for comparing the angular momenta in different regions having comparable mass . for a rotating body with a power - law density profile , the specific angular momentum is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant determined by the mass distribution , and @xmath74 is the cloud radius .",
    "the constant @xmath73 ranges from 0.33 for oblong bodies to 0.5 for disks . we adopt the intermediate value , @xmath75 ( used for spherical structures having constant surface density ) , for gmcs . note that because we do not know the inclination , @xmath76 , of a given cloud along our line of sight , our measurement of @xmath77 underestimates the true value , @xmath78 and , hence , our measurement of @xmath71 is also underestimated .",
    "the position angle of the gradient is the direction of the total angular momentum vector .",
    "equation [ eq : j ] may also be used to estimate the specific angular momentum initially imparted to a gmc by the ism from which it forms .",

    "the histograms show that , if the gradients observed in the molecular clouds are due to rotation , and assuming simple top - down formation , _ the specific angular momentum of the molecular clouds is less than that of the atomic material from which they presumably formed_. rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the angular momentum expected from simple formation theories , including the toomre and parker instabilities , was higher than the observed value by an average factor of 5 and by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "we measure an average factor of 27 , a median of 13 , with 11 clouds having a ratio of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig : jplot_m33 ] shows that @xmath80 is always the case for the 36 resolved gmcs in the rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) catalog .",
    "the reason that we are measuring larger ratios between the expected and observed @xmath71 is because we have taken direct measurements of the @xmath0  velocity gradients , @xmath43 , whereas rosolowsky et al .",
    "used a galactic rotation curve ( corbelli & schneider 1997 ) to estimate @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , we have measured higher velocity gradients in the atomic gas surrounding gmcs than those determined from the galactic rotation curve .",
    "overplotted in figure [ fig : jplot_m33 ] are data points from our study of five molecular clouds in the milky way ( paper i ) .",
    "the galactic gmcs , including perseus , orion a , ngc 2264 , monr2 , and the rosette , follow the trend of the m33 clouds in that the ratio of the specific angular momenta , @xmath81 , is always greater than unity and decreases with increasing @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "this proportionality is driven by the equality between @xmath82 and its inverse , as we do not observe a significant correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath82 .",
    "if gmcs inherit their rotation from the ambient @xmath0  from which they condense , one might expect their gradients to be much larger than observed . by conservation of angular momentum , in the absence of external forces , the ratio of the velocity gradient magnitudes before and after contraction is proportional to the radii of the rotating bodies : @xmath85 .",
    "thus , to conserve angular momentum , a cloud that contracts from an accumulation length of 70 pc to a typical gmc radius of 25 pc would have to spin up by a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "figures [ fig : m33_hist1](a ) , [ fig : m33_hist1](b ) , and [ fig : vplot_m33 ] show , however , that the magnitudes of gmc gradients are rarely much greater than those of the @xmath0  with which they are associated . from figure",
    "[ fig : vplot_m33 ] and table 1 we see that the average value of @xmath87 is 1.8 and reaches a maximum of 4.6 . from conservation of angular momentum",
    ", we might also expect to find molecular clouds rotating in the same sense as the surrounding ism from which they formed . as previously shown in figure [ fig : m33_hist2 ] , however",
    ", the position angles in the gmcs and associated @xmath0  differ by at least @xmath48 in over half of the regions .",
    "these key results may imply one of the following : ( 1 ) since gmcs formed , external torques , such as magnetic fields , may have caused the redistribution of angular momentum in the molecular clouds ; ( 2 ) the @xmath0  with which gmcs are presently associated is unrelated to and unrepresentative of the atomic gas which originally formed the molecular clouds ; or ( 3 ) the @xmath0  and gmcs are to some extent associated , but the origin of the gmc velocity gradients is not rotation .",
    "we consider each of these in turn below .",
    "first , given that the interstellar media of galaxies are magnetized  the mean field strength of m33 is @xmath88 @xmath89 g ( beck 2000)magnetic fields potentially play dominant roles in the formation and evolution of gmcs .",
    "for instance , many authors have advanced the parker instability as a mechanism for gmc formation ( e.g. , mouschovias et al .",
    "1974 ; blitz & shu 1980 ; shibata & matsumoto 1991 ) .",
    "parker ( 1966 ) showed that in a gravitational field , a vertically layered gas coupled to a magnetic field is unstable to long - wavelength perturbations .",
    "the attractiveness of this magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability is that it has time and length scales that are comparable to the estimates of gmc lifetimes and to the distance observed between gmcs .",
    "thus , if mhd effects play a significant role in the formation of gmcs , presumably they might also be responsible for redistributing angular momentum during later stages of gmc evolution .    while rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ruled out the parker instability as the dominant mechanism for gmc formation because it over - predicts the amount of angular momentum observed in gmcs , they suggested that magnetic braking _ could _ slow down the rotation of gmcs , since the alfvn speed in the ism of m33 ( @xmath90 ) is comparable to the timescales of certain instabilities they evaluated .",
    "yet because only 10% of the gmcs in their catalog have values of @xmath71 approaching values expected from @xmath91 , they propose that magnetic braking must occur early on in the lifetime of gmcs or else occurs in the atomic gas surrounding gmcs .",
    "mouschovias & paleologou ( 1979 ) predicted a set of observational consequences for a rotating cloud collapsing out of an ism threaded by a magnetic field that is initially perpendicular to the cloud s axis of symmetry . as the cloud collapses , one expectation is that the surrounding medium in the vicinity of the cloud will be set into corotation with cloud , a phenomenon that we do not observe in our results .",
    "mouschovias & paleologou also predicted that magnetic braking is highly efficient at slowing down rotation .",
    "according to their simulations , a rotating cloud with mass @xmath92 @xmath32  and density @xmath92 @xmath93 will have its angular momentum reduced by at least 99% within 1 myr , and the efficiency of magnetic braking will increase as the cloud contracts and as the density contrast between it and the surrounding medium increases .",
    "it would be worthwhile to find out what updated models predict for the rate of angular momentum loss in clouds having the masses and densities observed in gmcs .",
    "if the atomic gas presently surrounding gmcs is unrelated to the past formation history of gmcs , the comparisons we are making may be invalid . in order to resolve this issue",
    "we need some sort of control field with which to compare the @xmath0  currently harboring gmcs .",
    "it is for precisely this reason that we performed the analysis , outlined in  [ subsec : non - gmc ] , on `` non - gmc '' @xmath0  regions .",
    "we found that the two populations of @xmath0  have distinctly different distributions of gradient magnitudes and position angles .",
    "the atomic gas associated with gmcs has a typical @xmath77 of @xmath94  and the non - gmc @xmath0  has a typical value of @xmath95 .",
    "also , the median difference between the position angle of the @xmath0  and that of the galaxy is @xmath60 for the former population and @xmath61 for the latter .",
    "these differences in @xmath77 and @xmath96 between the two groups indicate that something unique has occurred in atomic gas associated with gmcs  presumably , something that has either _ caused _ the formation of the gmcs or has _ resulted from _ their formation .",
    "we have already seen that the mean gradient magnitude in atomic gas associated with gmcs is greater than the typical gradient in non - gmc @xmath0  (  [ subsec : gradients ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath0  containing gmcs has _ higher _ angular momentum ( and/or shear ) than non - gmc @xmath0 .",
    "we can evaluate how significant the difference is between the two populations by investigating the parameter @xmath97 , the ratio of a cloud s rotational energy to its self - gravitational energy ( goodman et al .",
    "1993 ) :    @xmath98    figure [ fig : bplot_m33 ] shows that non - gmc @xmath0  has a narrower distribution of @xmath97 and a lower mean , @xmath99 , than does atomic gas containing gmcs .",
    "thirty - two of 45 of the non - gmc @xmath0  regions have @xmath100 , whereas only 14 of the @xmath0  regions containing gmcs have values of @xmath100 .",
    "note that for @xmath0  regions containing gmcs , we calculate @xmath97 excluding the gravitational potential energy due to the gmcs within them ( figure [ fig : bplot_m33 ] [ a ] ) .",
    "this group has an average @xmath97 of @xmath101 , with 4 clouds having @xmath102 ( clouds 1 , 2 , 17 , and 43 ) , implying that these regions may have a considerable amount of rotational energy .",
    "note that for @xmath0  regions containing gmcs , we calculate @xmath97 excluding the gravitational potential energy due to the gmc within it ( figure [ fig : bplot_m33 ] [ a ] ) .",
    "if we calculate @xmath97 including _ all _ of the gas within a given region , the average for @xmath0  containing gmcs goes down to @xmath103 .",
    "the regions listed above still appear to have a considerable amount of rotational energy in comparison to their gravitational energy : @xmath104 , 0.75 , 0.88 , and 1.1 for clouds 1 , 2 , 17 , and 43 , respectively .",
    "clouds having large values of @xmath97 can potentially become stable against gravitational instabilities .",
    "it is difficult to see how gmcs could have formed under such conditions .",
    "these observations suggest that between the time prior to the onset of gmc formation to the time after formation , processes occur that increase @xmath77 observed in the @xmath0  associated with gmcs .",
    "an alternative is that gmcs preferentially form from gas having high @xmath77 , possibly in regions that are unstable to gravitational collapse .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that @xmath0  regions falling into classes 2 and 3 ( see  [ subsec : hi])regions where the gmcs are not quite spatially coincident with local @xmath0  maxima  tend to have lower gradient magnitudes ( @xmath105  with a dispersion of 40% ) than regions in class 1 ( 0.06  with a dispersion of 50% ) .",
    "we apply a t - test and find that the difference between the two classes is significant to the 95% confidence level .",
    "however , molecular clouds belonging to either class do not appear to have different distributions of @xmath77 ; that is gmcs in both class 1 and class 2 have the same average gradient ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this suggests that activity within the gmcs may have more of an impact on the surroundings than the surrounding environment has on the velocity fields of the gmcs .",
    "given that the gradient directions of the gmcs and associated atomic gas are generally not aligned , this raises the possibility that the linear velocity gradients observed in molecular clouds may not be caused by rotation .",
    "burkert & bodenheimer ( 2000 ) demonstrated that turbulent velocity fields can also cause linear gradients .",
    "they found that the gradient magnitude of turbulent cores scales with size as @xmath107 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : r - vgrad ] , fitting a power - law relationship to the gradients observed in the @xmath0  surrounding gmcs as a function of the accumulation radius , we find @xmath108 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath109 and size for the 36 resolved gmcs is @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig : r - vgrad ] also displays a combined fit for atomic gas and gmcs , which is in good agreement with the burkert & bodenheimer ( 2000 ) result .    in our previous study ( paper i )",
    ", we found that star formation activity provides a reasonable explanation of the gradients observed in a small sample of milky way molecular clouds . in at least three out of five cases , including orion a , ngc 2264 , and the rosette , the velocity fields may have been produced by expansion driven by highly energetic stellar winds .",
    "the location of @xmath111  regions corresponds to the highest velocities of the molecular material in these clouds . though the sample was too small to make a firm conclusion",
    ", it appears that the @xmath111  regions within these molecular clouds may also be influencing the morphology of the associated atomic gas . in ngc 2264 and the rosette , for instance , there are local peaks of @xmath0  that appear to have been swept up by expanding molecular gas . following up",
    "this study of m33 with an analysis comparing the locations of @xmath111  regions to the kinematic properties of gmcs could provide useful insight to how the velocity fields of the latter evolve .",
    "we have presented a detailed comparison of the velocity fields in 45 gmcs detected in m33 by rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using bima observations and the atomic hydrogen with which they are associated . using high - resolution vla 21-cm observations to create surface density and intensity - weighted first - moment maps of the @xmath0 , we also compared the properties of atomic gas containing molecular clouds with atomic gas in which molecular clouds have not been detected . based on our measurements , including the velocity gradient magnitudes and directions of these regions , we make the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the average surface density of atomic hydrogen associated with the gmcs is @xmath112 , similar to the saturation level of @xmath0  above which gas becomes primarily molecular in other galaxies , including the milky way ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ; wong & blitz 2002 ; bigiel et al .",
    "a power - law relationship exists between the @xmath0  surface density and gmc mass : @xmath113 .    \\2 .",
    "we observe three categories of gmcs , based on their proximity to local peaks in the atomic gas .",
    "the majority of gmcs ( 64% ) coincide spatially and kinematically with local @xmath0  peaks .",
    "twenty - nine percent of gmcs are located near the edge of an @xmath0  peak , or sit between two peaks .",
    "clouds in this category tend to have their mean lsr velocities offset from the mean @xmath0  velocity by a few .",
    "the remaining three clouds ( 7% ) are not associated with @xmath0  maxima and the mean velocities of the molecular cloud and atomic gas are offset by @xmath112 .",
    "thirty - nine out of 45 of the @xmath0  regions in the vicinity of gmcs have linear velocity gradients of around @xmath114  and spanning @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "if gmcs are rotating and initially inherited their angular velocity from the surrounding @xmath0 , conservation of angular momentum would require that the angular speed of a typical gmc ( @xmath117 pc ) speed up by a factor of 8 .",
    "the average value of @xmath87 , however , is only 1.8 .",
    "magnetic braking has been used by some authors to explain how the slowing of gmc rotation may have occurred .",
    "but if magnetic braking is as efficient at slowing rotation as predicted ( e.g. , mouschovias & paleologou 1979 ) , we would expect most gmcs to have much _ lower _ values of @xmath109as much as an order of magnitude less  than observed .",
    "alternatively , magnetic braking may be less efficient , or it may operate over longer timescales .",
    "fifty - three percent of the molecular clouds have gradients whose directions differ from the gradient direction in the local @xmath0  by more than @xmath48 .",
    "if the gradients in the gmcs were caused by rotation , this implies that over half of them are counter - rotating with respect to the atomic gas with which they are surrounded .",
    "this measurement is difficult to reconcile with the notion that gradients are due to rotation and that gmcs form in a simple top - down matter .",
    "gradients in the atomic gas associated with gmcs generally have larger magnitudes than expected from galactic differential rotation alone .",
    "also , 62% of these regions have gradient position angles that differ from the sense of galactic rotation by more than @xmath48 .",
    "we examined the properties of high - density @xmath0  regions in which molecular clouds have not been detected and found that they have a lower range of velocity gradients , @xmath118 , than regions where gmcs are observed .",
    "this suggests that something occurs during the course of gmc evolution that may increase the shear of the atomic gas .",
    "neither population of atomic gas has gradient directions that are preferentially aligned with the kinematic position angle of the galaxy , nor did we find a correlation between gradient magnitude and direction in either population .",
    "a power - law relationship exists between gradient magnitude and size in both the molecular clouds and the @xmath0  surrounding them . for gmcs , @xmath110 ; for @xmath0 , @xmath108 , where @xmath22 is the accumulation length .",
    "the combined relationship is @xmath119 , consistent with what burkert & bodenheimer ( 2000 ) found for the velocity fields of turbulent molecular cores .",
    "our analysis raises considerable doubt to the hypothesis that the origin of gmc velocity gradients is rotation .",
    "alternative explanations worth exploring include turbulence , shear , and star formation activity .",
    "the following figures display the velocity maps , position - velocity plots , surface density maps , and spectra of the @xmath0  regions associated with the remaining molecular clouds not displayed in our paper on giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) angular momentum in m33 ( imara , bigiel & blitz 2010 ) . if for a given region the gmc was resolved in the rosolosky et al .",
