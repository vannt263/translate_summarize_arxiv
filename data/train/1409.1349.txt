    "during the past few years , _ kepler _ telescope has discovered several planets in circumbinary orbits .",
    "all these planets have been detected photometrically , exhibiting transit signatures when passing in front of the stars of the binary .",
    "the first of these circumbinary planets ( cbps ) was kepler-16b discovered by doyle et al in 2011 . since then several more _",
    "kepler _ cbps have been discovered , namely kepler-38b @xcite , kepler-34b and kepler-35b @xcite , kepler-47b&c @xcite , kepler-64b @xcite , kepler-413b ( kic 12351927b ) @xcite , and kic 9632895b @xcite .    among the currently known _",
    "circumbinary planetary systems , kepler-47 presents an interesting case . the fact that this system harbors two planets is a strong indication that similar to planet formation around single stars , circumbinary planets can also form in multiples .",
    "the latter implies that more planets may exist in any of the currently known circumbinary systems . in the kepler-47 system ,",
    "the existence of a third planet was speculated in its 2012 discovery paper as a way to account for an unexplained feature observed in the light curve of this binary @xcite . as reported by these authors , a single ,",
    "0.2% deep transit event had been detected which could not be explained by the two known transiting planets .    in this paper , we plan to test the above - mentioned hypothesis .",
    "our approach is to study the dynamics of the three - planet system , and use long - term stability to identify the viable regions where the orbit of the third planet would be stable . using dynamical stability to predict",
    "additional planets has been presented in several other studies @xcite . in cases where stable regions are identified",
    ", we will use transit timing and transit duration variations to constrain the orbit of the third planet .",
    "the dynamics and orbital stability of planets in circumbinary orbits have been the subject of studies for close to three decades .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite carried out long - term orbital integrations of test - particles aiming at exploring a large area of the system s parameter space . in particular , for p - type orbits , the authors established stability criteria for a planet s semimajor axis as a function of the binary orbital parameters and mass - ratio .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also studied the stability of planetary orbits in p - type systems and presented criteria for stable , marginally stable , and unstable circular planetary orbits .",
    "recent analytic analysis of the dynamics of circumbinary planets has also been presented by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review the kepler-47 system as described by @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe our numerical techniques and in section 4 , we present the results of our stability analysis using the chaos indicator megno ( mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits ) . in section 5",
    ", we calculate the transit durations of kepler-47b and the candidate third planet , and compare them with their measured value as reported by @xcite to constrain the orbit of the third planet .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we conclude this study by presenting a summary and discussing the implications of the results .",
    "kepler-47 is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a @xmath1 primary and a secondary with a mass of @xmath2 .",
    "the period of this binary is 7.5 days . in 2012 , orosz et al .",
    "announced the detection of two planets in circumbinary orbits around this system .",
    "these authors analyzed long- and short - cadence photometric data from _ kepler _ space telescope , spanning 1050.5 days from quarter 1 to 12 , and identified eighteen transit events of the inner planet ( kepler-47b ) and three for the outer planet ( kepler-47c ) .",
    "table [ planetparams ] shows the published ( osculating ) orbital parameters of kepler-47 and its two planets .",
    "we note that because of observational degeneracies , not all orbital parameters can be determined from the photodynamical model as described in @xcite .",
    "we also note that all orbital elements are in the ( geometric ) jacobian coordinate system .",
    "the inner planet , kepler-47b , with a period of 50 days , is the smaller of the two with a radius of @xmath3 earth - radii .",
    "@xcite estimated that the mass of this planet is 7 - 10 earth - masses .",
    "due to the non - detection of etvs , an upper limit of 2 jupiter - masses can firmly be established for this object .",
    "the outer planet , kepler-47c , has an orbital period of @xmath4 days with a @xmath5 earth - radii .",
    "the authors estimated a plausible mass in the range 16 - 23 earth - masses .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of this planet was determined to be 28 jupiter - masses .    in their analysis of the light curve of kepler-47 system",
    ", @xcite detected a single transit event that could not be explained by the transits of the two planets . with a formal significance of @xmath6",
    ", this transit event occurred at bjd @xmath7 , approximately 12 hours after the last transit of kepler-47b in the q12 data set .",
    "the duration of this transit was observed to be @xmath0 hours .",
    "@xcite suggested that if this transit event is due to a third planet , given its depth of 0.2% , the planet must have a radius @xmath8 earth - radii .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to examining this hypothesis using dynamical considerations . integrating the five - body system of the binary and three planets",
    ", we will determine the ranges of the parameters for which the orbit of a hypothetical third planet will be stable , and using the properties of the above - mentioned single transit event , we will identify the most probable regions around the binary where the orbit of this planet may exist .",
    "we note that results presented in this work have been obtained from direct numerical integration of the equations of motion using the initial conditions shown in table [ planetparams ] .",
    "the orbit of the binary system is fully resolved and the three planets are treated as massless as well as massive objects .",
    "we adopted two different algorithms for solving equations of motion : the idl implementation of the livermore solver ( lsode ) which is an adaptive algorithm with a step - size control , and an accurate extrapolation method implemented as the gragg - bulirsh - stoer ( gbs ) algorithm ( the odex code ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is frequently used in celestial mechanics and orbit calculations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "* both algorithms use a relative and absolute error tolerance parameter to control the integration accuracy .",
    "we set these parameters to one part in @xmath9 .",
    "when integrating several test orbits of the five - body problem , we obtained identical results using both algorithms .",
    "*    we would like to note that , when transforming orbital elements , we use jacobi - like coordinates with a mass - parameter @xmath10 for each planet . here",
    "@xmath11 is the mass of the @xmath12th planet , @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the masses of the binary stars , and @xmath15 is the gauss gravitational constant .",
    "the transformed orbital elements are then given relative to the center of mass of the binary system .",
    "this approach differs from the usual definition of jacobi elements where the position and velocity of a planet are given relative to the center of mass of all remaining massive bodies within its orbit .",
    "our stability analysis employs the well - established fast chaos indicator megno technique @xcite which enables us to explore the phase space topology of the system .",
    "the megno technique has found widespread applications within dynamical astronomy @xcite and is closely related to the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) @xcite . in brief ,",
    "megno , shown by @xmath16 here and throughout the paper , has the following properties . for initial conditions resulting in quasi - periodic orbits , @xmath17 for @xmath18 . for chaotic orbits , @xmath19 for @xmath18 where @xmath20 is the maximum lyapunov exponent ( mle ) .",
    "in the simulations presented in this paper , we chose to stop a given integration when @xmath21 .",
    "orbits with quasi - periodic time evolution usually assume values of @xmath22 at the end of the numerical integration .",
    "we used the megno implementation within the mechanic package @xcite , and considered the integration time for each orbit to be @xmath23 binary periods .",
    "we begin our stability analysis by adding a hypothetical third planet ( hereafter shown by letter d ) to the kepler-47 system .",
    "our goal is to identify regions of the parameter space where the third planet can have a long - term stable orbit . throughout our analysis ,",
    "we start planets kepler-47b and c at their published osculating elements ( table [ planetparams ] ) and set their masses equal to 10 and 23 earth - masses , respectively .",
    "the initial orbital orientation of the third planet is taken to be co - aligned with kepler-47c .",
    "we first consider the third planet to be massless .",
    "figure [ k47_map017 ] shows the values of megno for different initial values of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the third planet in an @xmath24 space .",
    "the initial osculating elements for the two known planets are shown by black dots .",
    "the color - coding in this and subsequent megno maps represents the value of megno , @xmath16 .",
    "higher values ( lighter colors ) correspond to higher degree of chaos and therefore , higher chance of instability .",
    "as shown here , there are * three * regions where a third planet can maintain a quasi - periodic orbit : * i ) a region in the vicinity of kepler-47b * , ii ) a region between the two known planets , and iii ) the region exterior to the orbit of kepler-47c ( but interior to the general quasi - periodic area shown in dark colors ) .    * in a multi - planet system , different types of perturbation affect the dynamical evolution of the system on different timescales .",
    "in general , there is a timescale associated with the effect of short - term mmrs , a timescale due to secular resonances ( slow variation of orbital elements ) , and a longer evolutionary timescale due to the tidal effects , mass - loss and other weak perturbations . when using a fast stability indicators such as megno , because the properties of a given solution in the phase - space must be determined on a small length of the orbit , the stability of a particular orbital configuration must be presented in the context of these timescales . in a compact configuration , for instance when the third planet is between kepler-47b and c , the dynamics of the system is mainly affected by the short - term 2-body and 3-body mmrs .",
    "similar numerical experiments such as those by @xcite and references therein suggest that in a study as the one presented in this paper , when the value of megno converges to @xmath25 ( indicating a quasi - periodic orbit ) , the stability of the system ( the orbit - crossing time ) is guaranteed for a time 23 orders of magnitude longer than the megno integration time - span . in the case of the kepler-47 system ,",
    "the crossing - time is longer than at least @xmath26 binary period .",
    "the protecting effect of mmrs imply that in some regions such as a number of orbits in the islands of quasi - periodicity at @xmath27  au ( figure [ k47_map017 ] ) , the entire five - body system will be stable for even longer times ( e.g. , as long as the lifetime of the system s stars ) .",
    "*    it is important to note that when longer - period , multi - body mean - motion or secular resonances exist , the convergence of megno for relatively short integration times does not necessarily imply stability for the lifetime of the binary .",
    "the perturbations from these resonances may result in dynamical instability over tens of millions or billions of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "that means that either the megno integrations must cover a significant fraction of the secular timescales , or direct numerical integrations have to be carried out in order to ensure that the system is stable over the time - span of interest .",
    "despite the above - mentioned shortcoming , megno integrations can still provide accurate and reliable characterization of the phase - space with a very small cpu overhead .",
    "they are also very useful in obtaining rough stability limits . in figure",
    "[ k47_map017 ] , we have plotted such limits ( black curves ) around the orbit - crossing curves of the third planet with kepler-47b and c(red curves ) following the semi - empirical stability criterion presented by @xcite . the stability criterion by these authors has been derived from the wisdom s stability criterion for the restricted three - body problem .",
    "unfortunately , this criterion does not seem to determine the limits of stable regions in the kepler-47 system , properly .",
    "for instance , as it will be shown later , the interesting region of @xmath28 is considered to be unstable when using the stability criterion by @xcite . however , as our megno maps show ( see also figure  [ k47_map055_map056 ] ) , this region contains a set of mmrs where the entire five - body system can be stable .",
    "a similar argument applies to the region immediately beyond the orbit of kepler-47c . as indicated by our calculations ,",
    "a few islands of stability exist in this area that correspond to two - body mmrs ( e.g. , 3d:4c , 2d:3c and 4d:7c ) , whereas according to the stability criterion by @xcite , this region is unstable .    in figure  [ k47_map055_map056 ] , we show these regions in more detail . in each panel , we label each quasi - periodic island with its associated two - body mean - motion resonance",
    ". tables [ detailsofmmrinterior ] and [ detailsofmmrexterior ] give the values of the inner and outer semimajor axis of the third planet indicating the width of each resonance valid for the third planet on a circular orbit .    from all the orbits shown in figure [ k47_map055_map056 ] , we chose 11 ( labelled as ic1 to ic11 standing for initial conditions 1 to 11 ) and studied their long - term dynamical evolution by integrating them for @xmath29 years . results for initial conditions ic1 and ic2 are shown in figure  [ k47_orbit01_orbit03 ] . in order to highlight the details of the evolution of these orbits , we only show the results of the first 10,000 years of integrations . as shown here ,",
    "both orbits have identical initial eccentricities ( 0.01 ) .",
    "however , their initial semimajor axes are different by @xmath30 au .",
    "results indicated that despite such a small difference in initial conditions , the evolutions of these two orbits are profoundly different .",
    "a chaotic characteristics is clearly visible for ic2 which exhibits a random walk in semimajor axis and eccentricity .",
    "this random walk is an indication of a stochastic process over time , slowly destabilizing the orbit by driving the orbital eccentricity to unity .",
    "we find the third planet to be eventually ejected from the system after some 190,000 yrs . for ic1 , the third planet follows a bound stable quasi - periodic orbit over at least @xmath29 years and shows no sign of chaotic diffusion .",
    "the orbital evolution of the two known planets of the system , kepler-47b and kepler-47c ( both with their assigned masses ) show similar dynamical behavior with their orbits bound between a minimum and maximum value for their orbital elements .      * in figure 2",
    ", we have labelled the islands of quasi - periodic orbits with their associated mean - motion resonances .",
    "to illustrate the true resonant character of these orbits , we have calculated their critical arguments ( resonant angle ) using *    @xmath31    in this equation , @xmath20 and @xmath32 denote the mean longitude and longitude of pericenter , respectively and coefficients @xmath33 are integer numbers satisfying dalambert rule .",
    "we found that the resonant angle corresponding to each quasi - periodic island exhibits a clear librational behavior around zero degrees .",
    "we show the time evolution of the resonant angle for a few selected initial conditions ( ic1 , ic3 , ic4 in the region between kepler-47b and c , and ic8 beyond the orbit of kepler-47c ) in figure  [ mmrplots ] . as shown in this figure , the variation of the resonance angle for ic8 has larger amplitudes .",
    "the mmr - locking is deep in all cases and supports the interpretation that the islands of quasi - periodic orbits in the megno dynamical maps are associated with mean - motion resonances .",
    "this results also has encouraging implications for the possible detection of a third planet since mmrs can lead to an amplified ttv signals compared to those of the orbits in non - resonant configurations @xcite .",
    "results shown in the previous section enabled us to identify regions of the parameter space where a test particle could maintain a stable orbit alongside the two massive planets , kepler-47b and c. in reality , however , the third planet is also massive and its interaction with other planets can alter the orbital architecture of the system . in the following , we will explore the dynamical characteristics of the system by considering the third planet to be massive as well .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the mass of the putative third planet is practically unconstrained . however , the depth of its single transit points towards a planet with a radius of @xmath34 earth - radii . because of the lack of a precise model for the density and interior of such planets , we consider a range of values for the mass of the third planet from 0 to 150 earth - masses .",
    "figures  [ masssurvey1 ] and [ masssurvey2 ] show the results of the calculation of megno for the entire 5-body system considering the third planet to have a mass of 0 , 10 , 23 and 100 earth - masses .",
    "we probed the semimajor axis of the third planet in the interval of 0.1 au to 1 au in figure  [ masssurvey1 ] and between 1 au and 3 au in figure [ masssurvey2 ] . in all maps",
    ", we considered the orbital eccentricity of the third planet to vary in the range of 0 to 0.5 .",
    "as shown in these figures , there are regions between planets kepler-47b and c where the third planet can have stable orbits .",
    "these figures also show the change in the mass of the third planet does not seem to have a significant impact on the overall dynamical structure of the system . however , subtle differences do appear .",
    "for instance , a close inspection of the results indicates that the quasi - periodic regions around kepler-47b tend to diminish with increasing the mass of the third planet .",
    "also , considering a massless third planet at a semimajor axis of 0.989 au with an eccentricity of 0.15 seems to result in a chaotic orbit .",
    "however , increasing the mass of the planet to 100 earth - masses renders the orbit with the same initial condition , quasi - periodic .",
    "we also noticed that some of the mean - motion resonances around 0.8 au had vanished when considering the third planet to be of 100 earth - masses .",
    "for such a high value of the mass , the locations of quasi - periodic mean - motion resonances between the third planet and kepler-47c appear to have shifted to smaller semimajor axes .",
    "the effect of changing the values of the mass of a planet on the location of mean - motion resonances has been illustrated in detail by @xcite in their study of the system of @xmath35 octantis .",
    "in general , resonances may become wider / narrower or even split if the masses of planets change .",
    "diminished quasi - periodic regions exterior to the orbit of kepler-47c were also observed when the third planet was taken to be 100 earth - masses .",
    "it seems that low - eccentricity , co - orbital , quasi - periodic orbits are more likely when the third planet has a higher mass .",
    "results shown in figures  [ masssurvey1 ] and [ masssurvey2 ] suggest that a third planet in a low - eccentricity orbit can be stable in the region between kepler-47b and c , and also for semimajor axes larger than 1.75 au .",
    "the main requirement for long - term orbital stability is set by the third planet s pericenter distance . in order for the planet to be stable , this distance has to be well - separated from kepler-47b and c ( hence its low - eccentricity orbit ) so that the gravitational perturbation of these bodies can not alter the dynamics of the planet .    to examine the long - term stability of the third planet",
    ", we carried out two single - orbit integrations for @xmath29 years .",
    "we considered the third planet to be 50 earth - masses and chose its initial semimajor axis and eccentricity the same as in ic3 in figure  [ k47_map055_map056 ] ( the third planet being interior to kepler-47c ) and ic6 in figure  [ k47_map055_map056 ] ( the third planet being exterior to kepler-47c ) .",
    "figure  [ k47_orbit22e_orbit25orphan50mearth ] shows the result . as shown here ,",
    "no sign of chaotic diffusion is observed for any values of the orbital elements of the third planet .",
    "this suggests that a third planet with a mass of 30 earth - masses or smaller can have a stable orbit either between the two known planets ( ic3 ) or in an orbit exterior to kepler-47c ( ic6 ) .",
    "the orbits of planets b and c exhibit a very weak signature of chaotic dynamics . in both simulations ,",
    "the orbits of these planets remained bound and did not show any sign of a random walk .",
    "we carried out similar simulations for higher values of the mass of the third planet .",
    "we found that the simulation with initial conditions ic3 results in chaotic and unstable orbits when the mass of the third planet is as high as 150 earth - masses .",
    "however , when starting the third planet with initial conditions ic6 , we found that larger masses are allowed rendering an overall stable configuration .",
    "as shown in the previous section , dynamical considerations point to regions in the kepler-47 two - planet system where a third body can have a stable orbit . however , this orbit is unconstrained . in this section ,",
    "we use the measured time and duration of transits in the kepler-47 system to constrain the orbit of the third planet .",
    "we start by calculating transit duration ( tdv ) and transit timing variations ( ttv ) induced by the third planet on kepler-47b . due to its shorter orbital period , this planet has higher number of transits providing a large set of measurements for comparison and verification purposes .",
    "to calculate the values of ttv and tdv of a planet , we use the same numerical integration algorithm that was used in generating megno maps .",
    "we integrate the full five - body system using the values of the masses and radii of the stars and planets as well as the orbital elements of the two known planets as given in table 1 . during the integration",
    ", we monitor the on - sky projected position of the planet ( @xmath36 ) relative to the primary star . once the planet has crosses the north - south axis passing through the center of the star , we determine the time of ingress ( @xmath37 ) from a series of back- and forth - integrations . at each integration step , the quantity @xmath36 is compared to the sum of the star and planet radii @xmath38 . in each iteration , our algorithm decreases the time step by a third in order to ensure convergence .",
    "the time of ingress is defined when @xmath39 . from reversing the velocities of all bodies ,",
    "the egress time @xmath40 is determined .",
    "the mid - transit time is then calculated from @xmath41 .",
    "we use linear regression to calculate the variations in the transit times ( ttv ) . the transit duration ( tdv )",
    "is calculated using @xmath42 .",
    "we have tested the calculation of ttv by reproducing the results given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ 3planets_ic25_orphan1mearth ] shows the results for kepler-47b .",
    "we considered the third planet to have 1 earth - mass and started it at the initial condition ic6 .",
    "the top three panels in figure  [ 3planets_ic25_orphan1mearth ] show the resulted variations in the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination .",
    "the bottom two panels show the values of the ttv and tdv . here",
    "we have connected consecutive transit events with a solid line .",
    "the vertical lines show the cycle numbers for which the first or last transit is detected while being part of a consecutive transit series .",
    "an example of a consecutive transit series is the transits 59 to 105 .",
    "as shown in the bottom two panels , there are two gaps between transits 22 and 59 , and between transits 105 and 143 ( where there is missing data ) . in these gaps ,",
    "isolated timing measurements ( shown by plus signs ) represent non - consecutive transit events . in other words , for those ttv / tdv data points that are not connected , the planet did not transit the star before and after the given data point .",
    "for instance , we see from figure  [ 3planets_ic25_orphan1mearth ] that there are four isolated near - miss transits after the transit cycle 22",
    ". there are missing transits in all gaps which have not been plotted for the obvious reason .",
    "such missed transit events were also observed in the light curve of kepler-413b @xcite .",
    "the only explanation for such single - transit or near - miss events is the short - term variations in the planets orbital elements .",
    "as shown in figure  [ 3planets_ic25_orphan1mearth ] , the orbital elements of kepler-47b do indeed undergo significant changes from one transit to another suggesting that the gaps are due to the low orbital inclination of kepler-47b relative to the plane of the sky .",
    "we recall that the closer the inclination is to @xmath43 , the closer the planet will be transiting along the star s equator .",
    "therefore , for the specific geometry of the kepler-47 system , the projected orbital plane of kepler-47b on the plane of the sky will be outside the star s disk @xmath44 and therefore , no timing measurements can be computed . as a result",
    ", such events do not appear in figure  [ 3planets_ic25_orphan1mearth ] .",
    "however , for a given value of the orbital inclination , we do obtain single transit events and alternating missing transits when kepler-47b is close to the edge of the star .",
    "interestingly , we see no near - miss or isolated transit prior to transit 59 .",
    "a detailed examination of the light curve at around transit 59 shows that the transit - to - transit variations in semimajor axis and eccentricity of kepler-47b are minimal .",
    "we conclude that the short - term orbital variations are significant and capable of shifting the planet s projected disk in and out of the stellar disk .",
    "this is an interesting result as missing transit events can be used to further constrain the results of photodynamical models in future discoveries of transiting circumbinary planets .      in this section",
    ", we calculate the durations of the transits of the third planet and compare them with the duration of the single , unexplained transit event of the system to constrain the orbit of this body .",
    "it is important to note that because of the mutual interactions between planets , the duration of the transits of the third planet will vary from one transit cycle to another .",
    "figure  [ varioustdvs ] shows this for different values of mass and initial orbital configuration of the third planet . in making this figure , we only considered initial conditions for which our megno calculations indicated quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "in particular , we considered initial conditions ic1 to ic11 shown in figure  [ k47_map055_map056 ] ( except for ic2 for which the orbit of the planet was found to be highly chaotic ) .",
    "we also considered two cases for the mass of the third planet : a mass - less object shown on the left panels , and a 10 earth - mass planet depicted on the right .",
    "the methodology for calculating transit duration is similar to the procedure described in the previous section . in each panel ,",
    "the horizontal line at 4.15 hours corresponds to the duration of the single transit event identified by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ varioustdvs ] , in general , the mass of the planet does not play a significant role in the duration of its transit .",
    "we found that in spite of its variations , there are several transit cycles in which the duration of the transit of the third planet is comparable to that of the observed single transit ( @xmath0 hours ) . for instance , in the top - left panel of figure  [ varioustdvs ] where the planet is mass - less and starts at the initial condition ic1 , the transit number 83 appeared to have a duration of 4.16 hours .",
    "transit durations of around 4 hours were also found for initial conditions ic3 and ic4 .",
    "we recall that ic1 , ic3 and ic4 are initial conditions where the third planet starts between the two planets kepler-47b and c. we also found that when the planet is massive , transit durations of around 4 hours are possible for the initial condition ic6 where the orbit of the third planet is exterior to kepler-47c .",
    "the results mentioned above point to a strong degeneracy .",
    "it seems impossible to determine the correct orbit of the third planet using its transit duration .",
    "this degeneracy can , however , be broken assuming the third planet is in a circular orbit .",
    "as shown by @xcite , in this case , the orbital period of the third planet can be determine using    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the ( a priori unknown ) impact parameter .",
    "as @xmath46 varies only between 0 and 1 , we can use equation ( 1 ) to constrain the orbital period of the third planet and break the degeneracy . specifically , if @xmath47 ( i.e. a central transit ) then @xmath48 , representing a third body with the same orbit as that of the binary .",
    "this is consistent with the measured transit duration of 4.15 hours being comparable to the duration of the stellar eclipse . on the contrary , if @xmath49 ( i.e. a grazing transit ) , equation ( 1 ) gives @xmath50 , suggesting an upper limit for the period of the third planet of @xmath51 days . for a binary mass of @xmath52",
    "this corresponds to a semimajor axis of @xmath53 au , effectively ruling out initial conditions ic6 through ic11 , as well as orbits with progressively larger semimajor axis .",
    "thus the third planet is either on a stable orbit in the vicinity of kepler-47b or between the two known planets kepler-47b and c , or started along ic5 .",
    "in this study , we used dynamical considerations to examine the possibility that the single , unexplained transit in the kepler-47 system as reported by @xcite would be due to a third planet . using the megno technique , we identified regions in the phase - space where the third planet could follow quasi - periodic orbits considering the five - body problem .",
    "we determined several of such quasi - periodic regions between the two known planets kepler-47b and kepler-47c , where they also include orbital mean - motion resonances with either one of the two bodies .    using accurate single orbit integrations",
    ", we examined the long - term orbital stability of the third planet within the framework of a five - body problem .",
    "results identified ranges of semimajor axis and eccentricity that would render the third planet stable over a time period of 10 million years . to examine the extent of the dependence of the results on the mass of this planet , we carried out integrations for different values of its mass , and showed that a third planet with a mass as high as 50 earth - masses can still maintain stable orbits either between kepler-47b and kepler-47c , or beyond the orbit of kepler-47c . for higher masses of the third planet the quasi - periodic stable regions in the vicinity of kepler-47b",
    "ceases . for a selection of initial conditions within quasi - periodic islands we established a clear association of these islands with two - body mean - motion resonances by demonstrating a librating ( around zero ) critical argument .    to constrain the orbit of the third planet",
    ", we calculated its transit durations as well as the ttv and tdv of kepler-47b for various initial conditions .",
    "we found that transit duration and transit timing variations are affected by short - term changes in the orbit that have been caused by perturbations due to other bodies in the system .",
    "this implies that it is imperative to consider gravitational interactions when studying multi - body systems where mutual perturbations can be significant .    * also ,",
    "when the line - of - sight inclination of the transiting planet becomes small ( planet approaches the limb of the star ) , short - term perturbation on timescales on the order of the orbital period will have the effect of shifting the on - sky position of the planet .",
    "this can result in missing transits from one orbit to the other .",
    "these transit - missing events can be used to further constrain best - fit photodynamical models . in this study , for the first time , we have correlated the cause of missing transits with the short - term ( transit - to - transit ) variations of orbital elements .",
    "we also confirmed the possibility of long - duration transits .",
    "for instance in figure [ varioustdvs ] , considering the case of ic6 for a mass - less third planet , the duration of a single transit can last for nearly 60 hours*.    when calculating transit durations of the third planet , we found that the results suffer from a large degeneracy .",
    "several orbits produced similar transit durations as that of the single transit , 4.15 hours .",
    "we were able to break this degeneracy for circular orbits and determined an upper limit of 424 days for the orbit of the third planet .",
    "* in a recent study by @xcite , a period of 186 days was conjectured for the third planet in kepler-47 . using kepler s third law",
    ", we obtain a semi - major axis of 0.714 au ( relative to the binary center of mass ) for the third planet , placing it close to the stable 5c:8d mean - motion resonance or nearby resonances ( see figure 2 ) with kepler-47c .",
    "our work predicts several islands of quasi - periodic orbits in the neighbourhood of the 186 days orbit .",
    "@xcite also carried out long - term numerical integrations of the five - body system .",
    "their results support the finding that all planets maintain stable orbits over at least @xmath54 years . *    in the present analysis we suggest that a third planet could in fact be the cause of the single , unexplained transit event reported by @xcite .",
    "this planet will have a low eccentricity orbit either i ) in the vicinity of kepler-47b ( for low masses ) , ii ) between planets kepler-47b and kepler-47c , or iii ) exterior to planet c with a semimajor axis smaller than 1.24 au .",
    "* the detection of a third planet could follow along the route of measuring ttvs or tdvs of kepler-47b and/or kepler-47c as caused by this planet .",
    "however , the process of finding additional bodies using timing variations is highly degenerate and can lead to various dynamical configurations that produce the same timing signal @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that the entire currently available kepler photometric data on kepler-47 to be analyzed and searched for additional transit signatures that can not be explained by the two known planets kepler-47b and kepler-47c . *",
