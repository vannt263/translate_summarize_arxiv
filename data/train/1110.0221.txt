    "recent data on neutrino - nucleus scattering have improved our understanding of the neutrino - nucleus interaction , needed for neutrino oscillation experiments where nuclear targets are involved . among the results on partial cross sections ,",
    "the quasielastic one turns out to be very important @xcite .",
    "an outcome of these data was the display of an `` anomaly '' in the quasielastic cross section on @xmath1c .",
    "this quantity can be fitted by a relativistic fermi gas model only at the price of a modification of the axial form factor with an axial mass @xmath2 gev , instead of the usual value @xmath3 gev as measured in deuteron bubble chamber experiments . for nuclear physicists accustomed to the complexity of the many - body nuclear system ,",
    "this anomaly is likely to reflect the many - body aspect of the problem .",
    "indeed we have pointed out @xcite that , depending on the detection method , certain types of inelastic events can simulate quasielastic ones .",
    "this is the case for interactions leading to a final state with two or more nucleons ejected , if a quasielastic event is defined as one with only a muon in the final states , as in miniboone .",
    "multinucleon processes occur by nuclear correlations , with or without delta excitation .",
    "we have argued that this is the likely explanation of the anomaly showing that an evaluation can account for the excess cross section without any modification of the axial mass .",
    "after this suggestion , a number of articles @xcite have discussed the problem of multinucleon emission and whether it could account for the anomaly , with various conclusions , critical or supportive of our result .",
    "our previous works only dealt with the quasielastic cross section as a function of the neutrino energy . in the comparison with the experimental data , the uncertainties linked to the fact that the neutrino spectrum is broad are of experimental origin because the extraction of the energy dependence of the cross section involves a reconstruction of the neutrino energy whereas in the theoretical evaluation the neutrino energy is just an input . in the present work we discuss the double differential cross section .",
    "this is a directly measured quantity , free from the uncertainty of neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "however there remains an uncertainty on the theoretical side because the measured double differential cross section refers to the broad spectrum of neutrino energies .",
    "the theoretical predictions imply a convolution on this spectrum , which could be a source of error .",
    "nevertheless a good agreement with theory for the double differential cross section speaks in favor of the importance of the role of multinucleon emission process . in the present article",
    "we will also discuss the role played by relativistic kinematics .",
    "the momenta and energies involved in these neutrino reactions are rather large . for the miniboone experiment the neutrino",
    "energy extends to @xmath4 gev and the ejected nucleon kinetic energy in a quasielastic process can be a few hundred mev making a non relativistic approximation questionable . indeed , it was pointed out that conclusions on the role of the multinucleon process are doubtful within a non relativistic framework @xcite .",
    "it is one of the aims of this work to answer these criticisms . to improve our description we introduce in the present work relativistic modifications of the nuclear response , as proposed in @xcite . to single out their influence we keep for all the remainder of the description the same input parameters that we used in our previous work , in particular as concerns the description of the two particle - two hole ( 2p-2h ) processes , for which we use our parametrization deduced from the work of alberico _ et al . _",

    "we remind that we have also some 3p-3h contribution , taken from @xcite .",
    "all together we denote the sum by np - nh .",
    "we also keep the same values of the parameters of the particle - hole ( p - h ) force which governs the collective aspect of the nuclear response via the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we will show that while the relativistic treatment improves the description of the double differential cross section it is nearly without influence on the integrated quasielastic cross sections .",
    "our previous conclusion on the role played by the multinucleon processes in the axial anomaly is not an artifact of the non relativistic treatment of our earlier works .",
    "then we give the single differential cross sections,_i.e .",
