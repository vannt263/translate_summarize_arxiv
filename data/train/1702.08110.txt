    "solid - state quantum computers  @xcite have made significant progress recently in experiments of quantum error corrections  @xcite .",
    "topological error - correcting codes , such as surface codes  @xcite and color codes  @xcite , have been intensively investigated because quantum operations are realized through physical interactions between nearest neighboring qubits . however , physical wiring of electrodes to qubits is complicated and 3d integration for the wiring requires further development of fabrication technologies  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of wiring is mainly attributable to connections to syndrome - qubits from data - qubits .",
    "although quantum annealing machines based on superconducting qubits have already been developed  @xcite , in order to realize quantum computation , accurate control of quantum error correction is necessary .    here ,",
    "we propose a method to reduce the congestion of wiring to qubits .",
    "we just add a swap gate  @xcite after each controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . because swap gates exchange roles of qubits , the roles of syndrome measurements are shared between different qubits .",
    "this transforms the qubit layout and reduces the number of qubits that can not be accessed two - dimensionally .",
    "in particular , we show that fully 2d layouts including both qubits and control electrodes can be achieved for surface and color codes of minimum sizes .",
    "because a cnot gate is indispensable to every quantum computer , the work - sharing of qubits by swap gates will be applicable to general quantum circuits to improve uneven workloads of qubits .",
    "topological codes are based on the stabilizer formalism  @xcite , where a parity check process is carried out by summing ` 1 ' of data - qubits by using cnot operations .",
    "errors can be detected by change of the parity .",
    "as an example , when a wave function of four data - qubits is given by @xmath0 and a syndrome - qubit is initialized as @xmath1 , the measurement process of a @xmath2-type check operator ( @xmath2-check ) is given by @xmath3 ( fig.1(a ) ) , where @xmath4 denotes summation modulo 2 .",
    "similarly , the measurement process of a @xmath5-type check operator ( @xmath5-check ) is illustrated in fig.1(b ) ( @xmath6/2 $ ] ) . when the number of data - qubits increases , the corresponding number of wirings to a single syndrome - qubit increases .",
    "physical wires have a finite width and when many wires are arranged closely , the crosstalk problem also appears  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to avoid the concentration of wires in a small space .    using local interactions between nearest - neighbor qubits on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) physical plane , surface codes  @xcite and color codes  @xcite have a high tolerance against errors .",
    "however , control gate electrodes are not generally placed in the same physical plane as qubits , and vertical access to qubits is unavoidable .",
    "figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) show @xmath2-checks and @xmath5 checks of the 7-qubit color code , respectively .",
    "the three syndrome - qubits ` a - c ' are connected to seven data - qubits , where the data - qubit ` g ' should be accessed from the vertical direction by stacking an additional wiring layer .",
    "figure  1(e ) shows a distance-3 surface code , where @xmath2-checks and @xmath5-checks are performed simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "the code - distance @xmath7 is the measure of a code in which @xmath8 physical errors can be corrected by repeated measurements , and corresponds to the array size in the surface code . in this code",
    ", the inner nine qubits should be accessed vertically  @xcite .",
    "thus , many stabilizer codes lead to a concentration of wires to syndrome - qubits and the complexity of wiring between qubits is unavoidable  @xcite . because qubits are sensitive to decoherence",
    ", the fabrication process of wiring is particularly difficult in view of the state - of - the - art techniques .",
    "our method for reducing wiring congestion is to just add a swap gate after each cnot gate in stabilizer measurements .",
    "swap gates are widely used in quantum operations and exchange qubit states without changing system entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the combination of a swap gate and a cnot gate ( hereafter a ` cnot+swap gate ' ) shifts the role of syndrome - qubits , and reduces the congestion of wiring .",
    "the replacement of cnot gates by cnot+swap gates is effective in stabilizer measurements because syndrome measurements are repeated many times .",
    "we show that this method changes qubit layouts , and importantly , for codes of small sizes , wiring can be set on the same physical plane as qubit array .",
    "the insertion of a swap gate in each cnot gate imposes no overhead but rather it is advantageous when physical interactions between qubits are @xmath9 interactions  @xcite .",
    "the cnot+swap gate can be performed directly by the @xmath9 interaction ( iswap ) with single - qubit rotations ( fig.2(a ) )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a cnot gate needs two iswap gates , which makes the cnot operation complicated and more fragile .",
    "thus , in the case of the @xmath9 interaction , the replacement of cnot gates by cnot+swap gates makes quantum operations more reliable and saves operation time  @xcite . moreover , high - precision iswap gates are experimentally feasible  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we show an example of the application of replacement of cnot gate by cnot+swap gate to fundamental stabilizer measurement . in sec .",
    "iii , we show layout changes of a minimum 7-qubit color code and the second smallest color code by our method . in sec .",
    "iv , we first show layout changes of standard surface codes .",
    "next we consider the application of our method to a rotated surface code , and we also show results of numerical simulations of logical error probabilities . sec .",
    "v is devoted to a conclusion . in appendix",
    ", we show detailed explanations of the numerical simulation of sec .",
    "iv and a process of fault tolerant 7-qubit color code .",
    "the effect of the insertion of a swap gate after each cnot gate is easily understood when we apply this to the single stabilizer measurement shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , the results of which are shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) , respectively . for the @xmath2-check",
    ", we have @xmath10 we can see that the swap gates shift the roles of qubits one by one , and finally if we regard qubit ` 4 ' as a new syndrome - qubit , we obtain the same wave function @xmath11 as that of fig .",
    "1(a ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the qubit layout is now transformed to a one - dimensional qubit array .",
    "the same thing holds for the @xmath5-check ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) : @xmath12 if we measure qubit ` 4 ' , we obtain the same wave function @xmath11 as that in fig",
    ".  1(b ) .",
    "thus , we can avoid the congestion of wiring to one syndrome - qubit by just inserting swap gates .",
    "after the @xmath2-checks in fig .",
    "2(b ) , when qubit ` 4 ' is initialized to a @xmath13 state , and the process of fig .",
    "2(b ) is reversed from the green operation to the black operation , we can restore the qubits to their original roles ( closed circle is back to the syndrome - qubit ) . thus",
    ", serial operations of @xmath5-checks following @xmath2-checks can be repeated , and the role of syndrome qubit is shared between the two end qubits .",
    "let us show the effect of the replacement of cnot gates by cnot+swap gates in the 7-qubit color code , which is the minimum color code ( code distance 3 )  @xcite .",
    "new connections between qubits are determined such that each step reproduces the same qubit states as those of figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) .",
    "figures  2(d ) and 2(e ) show the results of applying cnot+swap gates , instead of cnot gates , to the 7-qubit color code .",
    "this replacement transforms the qubit layout to a quasi - one - dimensional layout , where 2d access to all qubits is possible ( fig .",
    "2(f ) ) , and consequently no additional 3d layer for wiring is needed .",
    "figure  2(e ) is carried out after fig .",
    "2(d ) , where the order of cnot+swap gates is reversed between figs .",
    "2(d ) and 2(e ) .",
    "that is , we can use the same connections between the @xmath2-checks and @xmath5-checks , and syndrome measurements , in which the role of syndrome - qubits is shared in five qubits ( qubits ` a ' , ` b ' , ` c ' , ` a ' and ` b ' ) , can be repeated .",
    "the application of our method to the next larger code ( code distance 5 ) also reduces the number of qubits that can not be accessed two - dimensionally from 5 to 2 qubits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "so far , the stabilizer measurements have been assumed to be error - free . otherwise , unexpected errors propagate through the stabilizer measurements for the color codes .",

    "[ surface](b ) , where 20 qubits share the role of the syndrome measurement .",
    "the number of the qubits to which two - dimensional access is impossible is reduced to three ( qubits ` 14 ' , ` 22 ' and ` 42 ' ) from nine ( = 3@xmath143 in fig .",
    "similarly , the number of the qubits that can not be accessed two - dimensionally for a distance-5 surface code is reduced from 49 ( = 7@xmath147 ) to 35 ( = 7@xmath145 ) , as shown in fig  [ surface](c ) and fig .",
    "[ surface](d ) , respectively . in general ,",
    "the number of two - dimensionally inaccessible qubits for a distance-@xmath7 surface code is reduced from @xmath15 to @xmath16 by our method .    for distance-@xmath7 codes ,",
    "a set of syndrome measurements is repeated more than @xmath7 times .",
    "the next processes of figs .",
    "[ surface](b),(d ) are carried out by reversing both the order of the connections and the directions of arrows .",
    "that is , the green connections are carried out first and the black one last , reversing the directions of the interactions .",

    "[ surface](a),(c ) .",
    "rotated surface codes are known to be efficient surface codes  @xcite . in the case of distance-3 surface codes , the number of qubits is reduced from 25 ( fig .",

    "replacement of cnot gates by cnot+swap gates which corresponds to iswap gates changes layouts of quantum error - correcting codes and relaxes the congestions of wiring between qubits .",

    ", the concentration of workloads to specific qubits can be relaxed , and the degradation of the qubits will be mitigated .",
    "this will improve the reliability of a quantum circuit .",
    "moreover , it is considered that simple 2d circuits are important for initial development phases of experiments . in general , it is not easy to operate circuits as expected , because some mistakes are often found in designs after fabrications .",
