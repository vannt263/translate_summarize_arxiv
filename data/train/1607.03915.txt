    "low ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) are the most common active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , with numbers that exceed those of high ionization agn ( type - i and type - ii seyfert galaxies and quasars ) @xcite . at least in the local universe",
    "they make up 1/3 of all galaxies and 2/3 of agn population @xcite .",
    "liners are normally classified by their narrow emission line ratios , e.g. [ oiii]@xmath45007/h@xmath5 , [ nii]@xmath46584/h@xmath6 , and [ oi]@xmath46300/h@xmath6 @xcite . in general , they have lower luminosities than seyfert galaxies , but there is a big overlap between the groups in terms of properties like stellar mass , x - ray and radio luminosity , etc . @xcite .",
    "+ different mechanisms were proposed to explain the nature of liners .",
    "this includes shock excitation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photoionisation by young , hot , massive stars @xcite , photoionisation by evolved post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photoionisation by a central low - luminosity agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first two proposals failed to explain the properties of large samples of liners .",
    "the third possibility of pagb stars was suggested for liners with the weakest emission lines , located in galaxies with predominately old stars .",
    "they can be distinguished from strong - line liners using the equivalent widths ( ew ) of their emission lines , e.g. , ew([oiii]@xmath45007)@xmath71@xcite or ew(h@xmath6)@xmath73@xcite .",
    "several works however questioned this possibility , arguing that a population that is less luminous and more numerous than pagb stars would be needed to produce the luminosities observed in weak liners @xcite .",
    "however , most liners are powered by an agn , especially those with stronger emission lines ( e.g. , ew(h@xmath6)@xmath83 ) and unresolved hard x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "like other agns , liners can be divided into type - i ( broad and narrow emission lines ) and type - ii ( only narrow emission lines ) .",
    "their emission lines are characterised by lower levels of ionization than in seyferts , and their normalized accretion rates ( eddington ratio ) are 1 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "+ the best studied nearby liners ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are found in nuclei of galaxies with little or no evidence of active star formation ( sf ) .",
    "they are usually characterised as being hosted by massive early - type galaxies ( rarely spirals ) , and massive black holes in their centres , old stellar populations , small amounts of gas and dust , with low extinctions .",
    "such liners show weak and small - scale radio jets @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite studied sf in liners from the cosmos field at z@xmath00.3 using herschel / pacs observations .",

    "b ) even if assumed that all the observed h@xmath6 flux is due to sf ( a wrong assumption since much of it must be due to agn excitation ) it is still impossible to recover the sf rate ( sfr ) indicated by the fir observations . given this result , we suspect that active sf in liner host galaxies has escaped the attention of most earlier studies that focused on the innermost part of nearby galaxies . in this work",
    "we focus on the most luminous liners in the local ( 0.04@xmath7z@xmath70.11 ) universe and study their sf and agn activity , in order to understand the liner phenomenon in relation to star - forming galaxies and to compare their properties with those of the liners at z@xmath00.3",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "+ recently , @xcite studied the sfr - stellar mass plane for different types of low - redshift galaxies from the sdss survey .",
    "they classified all galaxies into star - forming , composite , sy2 , liners , and ambiguous , using the emission line ratios from mpa - jhu dr7 catalogues .",
    "6.5% of of the sources studied in this work are liners .",
    "we assumed this sample ( of 13,176 galaxies ) to be representative of liners at low redshifts and plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_ms ] a dotted box representing @xmath860% of the sources in @xcite",
    ". the average stellar masses and sfrs they found are @xmath7log(m@xmath25)@xmath8=10.74 and @xmath7log(sfr)@xmath8=-0.79 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than for our mlliners , @xmath7log(m@xmath25)@xmath8=10.82 and @xmath7log(sfr)@xmath8=0.86 , respectively .",
    "this is not surprising given that our mlliners were selected according to both lagn and lsf .",
    "the more important issue of the location of liners in the sfr vs. m@xmath25 plane as a function of lagn , as found here , was not considered by @xcite . to illustrate this we consider the properties of all sdss / dr7 liners in the redshift range 0.04 - 0.11 .",
    "we measured lagn as described above and used the scaled dn4000 method to estimate lsf .",
    "we then estimated their fraction on the ms using different bins of lagn , where the ms is defined exactly as in fig .",
    "[ fig_ms ] .",
    "the fraction of z=0.04 - 1.11 liners located on the ms is 2% , 3% , 11% , and 37% in the bins of loglagn=43 - 43.5 , 43.5 - 44 , 44 - 44.5 , 44.5 - 45 , respectively .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that the fraction of sf galaxies among low redshift liners is lagn - dependent . while studies like those of leslie et al .",
    "( 2016 ) are not available at higher redshifts , it seems that for the most luminous liners , this difference from the rest of the population extends at least to z=0.3 .",
    "in this work we analyse the properties of the 42 most - luminous liners ( in terms of agn and star - formation luminosities ) at z=0.04 - 0.11 from the entire sdss dr4 survey .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectroscopy of the nuclear regions for all sources , and fir data ( herschel and iras ) for 30% of the sample .",
    "we carried out spectral fitting using the starlight code and templates from @xcite , testing 25 ages and solar metallicity . from the best - fit models we obtained the emission spectra , stellar masses , sfrs , stellar populations , and ages .",
    "we used the spectra to measure the emission lines , extinction , and extinction corrected luminosities .",
    "we also measured the dn4000 and h@xmath9 indices .",
    "the agn luminosities were measured through extinction - corrected emission lines , and sfrs using different indicators ( both optical and fir ) .",
    "+ previous works characterised the population of local liners as : hosted by old and massive early - type galaxies , with low extinctions , massive black holes , old stellar populations and little star - formation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our most - luminous liners are hosted by both early- and late - types .",
    "moreover , @xmath025% of sources are peculiar systems , with clear signs of sub - structures and interactions or mergers .",
    "we found higher values of extinction than typical for most low - redshift liners .",
    "the nuclear regions mainly consist of intermediate ( 10@xmath15@xmath7age[yr]@xmath1610@xmath17 ) and old ( age[yr]@xmath810@xmath17 ) stellar populations , while young stars are present only in 43% of sources , similar to what has been found for nearby liners @xcite .",
    "the median sfrs are @xmath010[m@xmath3/yr ] , much higher than those for most local liners .",
    "however , it is interesting that they do not have the highest stellar masses , and in general show lower masses than other luminous liners .",
    "we found that the median stellar mass of our most - luminous liners corresponds to the mass of 6 - 7@xmath110@xmath2m@xmath3 measured in different works to be critical for the peak of relative growth rates of stellar populations ( highest sfrs and lsf ) .",
    "other liners although showing the same agn luminosities , show lower sf luminosities",
    ". + liners with these kind of properties were previously studied only at z@xmath00.3 @xcite . with our work",
    "we confirmed the existence of such liners also at low - redshifts ( z@xmath00.07 ) .",
    "they show the same properties in terms of stellar mass , sfrs , and agn luminosity at both redshifts .",
    "our most luminous liners tend to lie along the lagn = lsf line hinting for co - evolution of the two properties .",
    "in addition , most of them are found on the ms of sf galaxies , with stellar masses @xmath2710@xmath2m@xmath3 .",
    "finally , using the entire dr7 sample , we present evidence that the fraction of liners on the ms depends on their agn luminosity .",
