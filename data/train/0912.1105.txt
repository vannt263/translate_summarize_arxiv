    "<S> therefore , in this letter , we assume that a new physics scale relevant to @xmath0 is large enough so that production of a new particle is beyond the reach of the tevatron , which makes a key difference between our work and other literatures on this subject @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then it is adequate to integrate out the heavy fields , and we can adopt a model independent effective lagrangian approach in order to study new physics effects on @xmath13 and @xmath0 . the resulting effective lagrangian will be an infinite tower of local operators containing light quark ( @xmath14 ) , ( anti)top quark ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and gluon fields . at the tevatron , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , where the @xmath15 quark was treated as @xmath28 singlet and top currents were decomposed into vector and axial vector currents , rather than chirality basis as in our case . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the amplitude squared of dim-6 operators does not show simple dependence on the wilson coefficients as the interference term . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it includes additional contribution from the color - singlet operator which is proportional to @xmath57 and enhanced by the factor @xmath58 compared to the color - octet contribution . since the color - singlet operators do not interfere with the sm ones , we set @xmath59 and consider the validity region of our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> there are 3 inequalities we can consider : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the interference between the sm and the dim-6 operators , and @xmath62 is the contributions solely from the dim-6 operators . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath63 , a kind of fuzzy factor , measures the ratio of the subleading term to the leading @xmath64 ( sm contribution ) , and we take @xmath65 and 1.0 in the following . </S>",
    "<S> we vary the couplings @xmath66 in the range between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and find the regions that satisfy the above inequalities .    </S>",
    "<S> the first inequality constrains the parameter space to the band around @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the 2nd relation implies that the contributions from dim-8 operators are smaller than the dim-6 operators , and should be a good estimate in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our case , the interference @xmath61 is vanishing along the line @xmath69 , and we can not rely on the inequality , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we also impose the 3rd inequality , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) , which is relevant when @xmath70 , and the constraint is the elliptical shape centered at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> note that we impose the inequalities either ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) as the validity region , since we can not apply the inequality ( 5 ) around the line @xmath71 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1a ] , we show the allowed region in the @xmath72 plane that is consistent with the tevatron data at the @xmath73 level : @xmath74 pb and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the allowed region is around @xmath76 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the negative sign of @xmath78 is preferred at the 1 @xmath79 level . </S>",
    "<S> the validity region described in the previous paragraph is indicated in magenta , blue , black for @xmath80 and 1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the straight line is from the inequality eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) , the circles and their mirror images are from the inequality eq .  ( 5 ) , and the ellipse centered at the origin is from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that our effective lagrangian approach based on dim-6 operators is valid in an ample parameter space .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1bc ] ( a ) , we show the @xmath81 distributions for four different values of @xmath72 corresponding to the four corners of the allowed region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1a ] , as well as the sm prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 distribution depends only on @xmath13 , and there is no informations on the chiral structure because we have integrated out the angular dependence as well as new heavy degrees of freedom that could modify @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting observable which is sensitive to the chiral structure of new physics affecting @xmath82 is the top quark spin - spin correlation @xcite : c = . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity depends on the spin quantization axis , and there are three different axes that are mostly used : the beam axis , the top direction ( helicity basis ) , and the off - diagonal axis . at leading order , </S>",
    "<S> the sm prediction is @xmath83 for the helicity basis which we choose in this work . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that nlo correction to @xmath5 is rather large , shifting @xmath5 to @xmath84  @xcite , but it is beyond the scope of this work to pursue this issue further here . </S>",
    "<S> recently the top spin - spin correlation was measured by both cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the off - diagonal axis as the quantization axis in order to maximize the spin - spin correlation , they found @xmath85 ( cdf dilepton mode ) , @xmath86 ( cdf lepton + jets mode ) , and @xmath87 ( d0 dilepton mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with the sm prediction @xmath88 ( for the off - diagonal basis ) , albeit rather large uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting if the sm prediction is confirmed or not with more accumulated data in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> since new physics must have chiral couplings both to light quarks and top quark , the spin - spin correlation defined above will be affected . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , it is clear this correlation is sensitive to @xmath89 , since the linear term in @xmath49 does not contribute to the correlation @xmath5 after integration over @xmath49 . on the other hand , if one considers the forward and the backward regions separately , the spin - spin correlation would depend on @xmath90 and will be closely correlated with @xmath0 . therefore we propose a new spin - spin fb asymmetry @xmath37 defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 implies the cross sections in the numerator of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) are obtained for the forward ( backward ) region : @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity can be measured by dividing the @xmath2 sample into the forward top and the backward top events . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1bc ] ( b ) , we show the contour plots for the @xmath5 and @xmath37 in the @xmath94 plane along with the sm prediction at lo . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is a clear correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath95 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1a ] , which must be observed in the future measurements if the @xmath0 anomaly is real and a new particle is too heavy to be produced at the tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we considered dim-6 four - quark operators that could affect the @xmath2 productions at the tevatron , and found the necessary conditions for accommodating @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> now we study specific new physics that could generate the relevant dim-6 operators with corresponding wilson coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> it is impossible to exhaust all the possibilities , and we consider the following interactions of quarks with spin-1 flavor - conserving ( fc ) color - octet @xmath96 vectors , spin-1 flavor - violating ( fv ) color - singlet @xmath97 and color - octet @xmath98 vectors , and spin-0 fv color - singlet @xmath99 and color - octet @xmath100 scalars ( @xmath101 ) : & & _ int = g_s v_8^a_a + & & + g_s + & & + g_s , where @xmath102 denotes light quarks ( either @xmath103 or @xmath104 depending on the models ) . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction lagrangian encompasses many models beyond the sm , and makes a good starting point to study the underlying mechanism for the effective lagrangian discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> if the spin-1 particle has both the fc and fv interactions , we set @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the axigluon model @xcite corresponds to flavor universal chiral couplings : @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has a new gauge boson @xmath107 with dominant couplings to the @xmath103 and @xmath15 quarks , which in our language corresponds to @xmath108 and @xmath109 ignoring the fc coupling . the model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has a new charged gauge boson @xmath110 , which is obtained in our case by @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 or @xmath114 , respectively . in some rs scenarios </S>",

    "<S> another interesting possibility is minimal flavor violating interactions of color - triplet @xmath125 with mass @xmath126 and color - sextet scalars @xmath127 with mass @xmath128 with the sm quarks @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath129 and @xmath130 are color and flavor indices , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) , = g_s the @xmath131channel exchange of new scalars can contribute to @xmath132 , resulting in is also induced by color - triplet and sextet scalars , but is not shown , since it is irrelevant here . ] </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : wcs2 ] = - +  . </S>",
    "<S> since these new scalars couple only to the right - handed up - type quarks , constraints on the couplings @xmath133 and @xmath134 from flavor physics are rather weak , and one can accommodate the observed @xmath0 easily .    </S>",
    "<S> in table  [ tab : newparticles ] , we show the new particle exchanges under consideration and the couplings @xmath135 induced by them . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the four types of exchanges of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 could give rise to the large positive @xmath0 at the 1-@xmath79 level . among them , the following three types of couplings are more or less fixed as : @xmath140 for the case of @xmath136 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] shows the 1-@xmath79 favored regions of the couplings in the @xmath141 plane for several choices of @xmath142 taking @xmath143 . </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath148 is not allowed because @xmath149 and the constraint from @xmath13 disappears when @xmath150 , since @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to search for new vector or scalar particles that satisfy the above conditions at lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> a caution is in order . </S>",
    "<S> the second row with @xmath97 in table i is shown to be disfavored , which seems to be contradictory to the results of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where new particles were assumed to be light . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not the case , since we took a heavy new particle limit ( far below the new particle mass scale , @xmath152 ) in order to derive @xmath66 s , though we began with the full amplitudes using the above interaction lagrangian which are the same as the amplitudes in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> . therefore our results can not be in conflict with the claims of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rather , our results simply imply that a color - singlet spin-1 object can not accommodate the @xmath0 if it is too heavy to be directly produced at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , one has to consider a light @xmath97 scenario , where @xmath97 has to be light enough ( @xmath153 gev ) as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and then our effective lagrangian approach is not applicable for such a light @xmath97 .    on the other hand , a new particle with different quantum numbers ( color , spin and flavor mixings ) can affect the @xmath0 , even if it is too heavy to be produced directly at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , one can consider the color - sextet case in order to make clear our point . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , only @xmath154 ( and @xmath155 which is irrelevant in the interference ) is nonzero , and we have @xmath156 . </S>",
