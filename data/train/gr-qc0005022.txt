    "topological defects arise during spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with phase transitions , and cosmological evolution of them is considered to have played an important role in cosmology ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "topological defects produced in the early universe might give us some information on high energy phenomena which can not be reached by accelerator experiments , and those produced at the late time phase transitions @xcite also have attracted attention as a potential source of the cosmic structures .",
    "to study the topological defects is therefore crucially important in cosmology and elementary particle physics .    in general relativity ,",
    "topological defects have interesting features .",
    "topological defects are extended and relativistic objects due to their large tension .",
    "in particular , the gravitational field produced by an infinitely thin domain wall shows repulsive nature @xcite . on the other hand , although there are many studies about the properties of thick domain walls in the flat and de  sitter spacetime backgrounds @xcite , little is known about the existence of thick wall configurations on inhomogeneous , strongly curved background such as a black hole spacetime .",
    "thus it is intriguing to study the gravitational interaction between two extended relativistic objects : a topological defect and a black hole .    in most studies of defect  black hole system ,",
    "topological defects have been approximately treated as infinitely thin and non - gravitating objects whose dynamics is governed by nambu - goto action . within this context",
    ", the scattering problem of a nambu - goto string by a background black hole has been studied in detail @xcite . in the domain wall case , recently m.  christensen , v.  p.  frolov and a.  l.  larsen @xcite considered nambu - goto walls embedded in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime and found the static axisymmetric solutions .",
    "they showed that there exist a family of infinitely thin walls which intersect the black hole event horizon .",
    "however , little attention has been given to the system of a thick defect interacting with a black hole though a defect as a topologically stable configuration of a scalar field has a finite thickness .",
    "now we shall consider the validity of thin - wall approximation in the system of a topological defect and a black hole .",
    "in such a system , there are two characteristic scales : the thickness @xmath0 of the defect and the black hole radius @xmath1 . in the case of the system of an astrophysical black hole with the mass @xmath2 and a defect formed during a gut phase transition ,",
    "the thickness of the defect is much smaller than the black hole radius and therefore thin - wall approximation would be valid .",
    "however , it is not so hard to consider the situation that the thickness of defects can not be negligible as compared with the size of a small black hole . over the last few decades , many people have studied the formation of small black holes called primordial black holes ( pbhs ) and their cosmological implications .",
    "for example , studying the contribution of pbhs to cosmic rays enables one to place limits on the spectrum of density fluctuations in the early universe ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been discussed the possibility of thick defects and their roles in cosmology , _",
    "e.g. _ as a source of large - scale structure in the universe @xcite , or as a candidate for some kind of dark matter @xcite .",
    "for example , it is thought that the typical mass of pbhs which evaporate at the present epoch is @xmath3 , so @xmath4 . when one considers the topological defects formed during a phase transition at @xmath5 , such defects become thicker than the size of pbhs and thin - wall approximation is no longer valid .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the gravitational interaction between a domain wall and a black hole taking the thickness of the wall into account .",
    "we deal with scalar fields in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime with @xmath6 and sine - gordon potentials , which have a discrete set of degenerate minima .",
    "we explicitly show that static axi - symmetric thick domain walls intersecting the black hole do exist by numerical investigation .",
    "we consider a non - gravitating domain wall for simplicity .",
    "this test wall assumption might be valid when the symmetry braking scale of the scalar field is much lower than planck scale as will be shown later by dimensional analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we derive the basic equation and discuss the boundary conditions which represent the situation we want to study . in section 3 , we show the numerical result .",
    "we summarize our work in section 4 .",
    "we also discuss the validity of the assumption that the effects of gravity of domain wall can be ignored near the black hole horizon . throughout this paper",
    ", we use units such that @xmath7 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we consider a static thick domain wall in a black hole spacetime .",
    "the domain wall is constructed by a scalar field with self - interaction in a given curved spacetime . in what follows",
    ", we neglect the self gravity of the scalar field , as will be justified later . as a background spacetime",
    ", we consider the schwarzschild black hole @xmath8 for our purpose , we find that it is more convenient to work in the isotropic coordinates @xmath9 , where the new radial coordinate @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 we mainly consider the region outside the event horizon in this paper , which corresponds to @xmath12 . in this coordinate system ,",

    "@xmath32 has minima at @xmath33 for @xmath6 potential and at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) for sine - gordon potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is just a ratio of the horizon radius to the wall thickness measured in the asymptotic region , namely if @xmath36 is smaller ( larger ) than unity , then the wall is said to be thick ( thin ) as compared to the size of the black hole .",
    "we shall confine ourselves to the case that the core of wall is located at the equatorial plane @xmath37 of the black hole .",
    "the solutions without this assumption will be discussed in the separated paper @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we impose the dirichlet boundary condition at the equatorial plane @xmath38 now it is sufficient to consider the north region , namely the solution in the south region can be obtained via @xmath39 , @xmath40 of the spacetime .",
    "the regularity of the scalar field at the symmetric axis is give by the neumann boundary condition @xmath41 on the other hand , the boundary condition at the event horizon @xmath42 is given by the neumann boundary condition @xmath43 as is shown in appendix , the condition ( [ eq : bchorizon ] ) is the consequence of a natural requirement that the energy density observed by a freely falling observer remains finite at the event horizon . in practice ,",
    "the region of numerical integration should be finite , so that we need an asymptotic boundary condition at @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "taking into account the flat background solutions ( [ eq : flat4 ] ) and ( [ eq : flatsg ] ) , we impose the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the @xmath6 and the sine - gordon potentials , respectively .    in the next section ,",
    "we numerically integrate the field equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) using relaxation method under these boundary conditions at the equatorial plane ( [ eq : bcequator ] ) , at the symmetric axis ( [ eq : bcaxis ] ) , at the event horizon ( [ eq : bchorizon ] ) and in the asymptotic region ( [ eq : bcasymptotic1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bcasymptotic2 ] ) for both the @xmath6 and the sine - gordon potentials .",
    "the scalar field configurations @xmath48 satisfying ( [ eq : basic ] ) and the boundary conditions are shown in figs .  [ fig : config_phi4_compara][fig : config_sg_thick ] , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the cartesian coordinates @xmath51 , @xmath52 . here",
    "we show the results in typical two cases ; the @xmath53 case in which the thickness of the kinks ( [ eq : bcasymptotic1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bcasymptotic2 ] ) at @xmath54 is comparable to the schwarzschild radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : config_phi4_compara ] for @xmath6 and fig .",
    "[ fig : config_sg_compara ] for sine - gordon ) , and the @xmath55 case in which the thickness of the kinks ( [ eq : bcasymptotic1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bcasymptotic2 ] ) at @xmath54 is one order of magnitude larger than the schwarzschild radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : config_phi4_thick ] for @xmath6 and fig .",
    "[ fig : config_sg_thick ] for sine - gordon ) . in both the cases",
    ", we obtain a domain wall solution as a kink of the scalar field at the equatorial plane @xmath56 . particularly in the case",
    "@xmath55 , the black hole is enveloped in the core region of the wall .",
    "we also show the energy density @xmath57 of the scalar field given by @xmath58 + u[\\phi]\\ ] ] in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_phi4_compara][fig : energy_sg_thick ] , corresponding to figs .",
    "[ fig : config_phi4_compara][fig : config_sg_thick ] , respectively . in all the cases",
    ", one can see that the configuration actually has a wall - like structure , namely the energy density is localized around the equatorial plane with a certain thickness corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "we shall comment on the computational domain and the grid spacing taken in our calculation . in order that the asymptotic boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcasymptotic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bcasymptotic2 ] ) make sense , @xmath54 must be large enough . in the above calculation , we take the computational domain which is fifty times as large as the horizon radius ( _ i.e. _ @xmath59 ) , and we carry out the integration on @xmath60 grid ( the grid spacing in @xmath61- and @xmath62- direction is @xmath63horizon - radius and @xmath64 , respectively ) .",
    "then we clip the region @xmath65 , where the above results are insensitive to the value of @xmath54 and the number of grid points .",
    "in fact , the results do not change when we extend the computational domain to @xmath66 with keeping the grid spacing , and the results differ from ones on the finer ( @xmath67 ) grid with keeping @xmath59 at most 1% .",
    "we also comment that the reliability of the numerical code is checked in the flat space case and it reprodeces the exact solutions ( [ eq : flat4 ] ) , ( [ eq : flatsg ] ) with accuracy of @xmath68 .",
    "in order to answer the question whether or not scalar fields can actually form a topological defect in the vicinity of a black hole , we have numerically solved the equation of motion for real scalar fields with @xmath6 and sine - gordon potentials , which have a discrete set of degenerate minima , in the schwarzschild black hole background . in both @xmath6 and sine - gordon potential cases",
    ", we showed that there exist the static axi - symmetric field configurations which represent thick domain walls intersecting the black hole .",
    "in particular , we studied the specific case that the wall s core is located at the equatorial plane of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we introduced the parameter @xmath36 which characterizes the domain wall thickness compared to the black hole horizon radius ; the smaller than unity @xmath36 is , the larger the wall width is .",
    "we showed the domain wall solutions and their energy densities for @xmath69 and @xmath70 cases . in summary",
    ", we can say that a black hole is not an obstacle for scalar fields to form a domain wall configuration intersecting the black hole .",
    "one might wonder about our present results ; one naively expects that the scalar field could have no static distribution around a black hole and inevitably fall into the horizon as usual objects do .",
    "however , a domain wall is a relativistic object with a large negative pressure ( or large tension ) whose magnitude is comparable to that of energy density .",
    "furthermore in our study we examined the domain walls which are extended infinitely in space .",
    "then we can understand that the domain wall is suspended from the asymptotic region and supported against falling into the black hole by its tension , so that the static configuration is realized .    in our analysis , we assumed that the gravitational effect of the domain wall is negligible compared to that of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we shall comment on the validity of this assumption .",
    "the energy density of a domain wall is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the planck mass and @xmath73 is the newtonian constant . on the other hand , the curvature strength , or gravitational tidal force , of schwarzschild spacetime",
    "is estimated as @xmath74 at areal radius @xmath75 .",
    "then a ratio of the gravity which will be produced by the domain wall to the gravity of the background black hole is given by @xmath76 when @xmath77 becomes much smaller than unity , the gravity of the domain wall is negligible compared to that of the black hole , and our test wall assumption becomes valid . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravitating_param ] ) we have @xmath78 near the horizon ( @xmath79 ) . therefore ,",
    "when we consider domain walls with the symmetry breaking scale being much lower than the planck scale ( _ i.e. _ @xmath80 ) , we have @xmath81 and consequently our result gives a good description of shapes of gravitating thick domain walls near the black hole .",
    "we can also see from eq.([eq : gravitating_param ] ) that , in the thick wall ( @xmath82 ) case , if @xmath80 , the test wall assumption is still valid even at @xmath83 .    in the asymptotic region ( @xmath84 )",
    ", one may expect that the gravity of the domain wall is no longer negligible and changes the asymptotic geometry drastically .",
    "bonjour , charmousis and gregory have recently investigated the spacetime of a thick gravitating domain wall with local planar symmetry and reflection symmetry around the wall s core  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the domain wall spacetime becomes spatially compact and has a cosmological horizon as de sitter spacetime does .",
    "this suggests that , when a black hole exists and wall s gravity is taken into account in the region far from the black hole , the whole spacetime has a cosmological horizon and an axi - symmetric domain wall intersects both the black hole and the cosmological horizons as an equatorial plane in a schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime .",
    "this motivates us to study further the interaction between thick domain walls and black holes in , for example , schwarzschild - de sitter background .",
    "the domain wall solutions obtained here are thought to represent a possible final configuration of a gravitational capturing of a domain wall by a black hole . at present",
    ", it is far reaching for us to investigate a fully dynamical process such as the scattering and capture of thick domain walls by black holes .",
    "however , to get some insights into the problem , it is worth investigating the existence of the static axi - symmetric solutions which represent thick domain walls located away from a black hole .",
    "a cosmic string is also an extended relativistic object with large tension and thought to play more important role in cosmology than a domain wall does .",
