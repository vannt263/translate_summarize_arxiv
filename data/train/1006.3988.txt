    "uranium dioxide is an important and interesting material from both technological and scientific perspectives . during the past half - century , the electronic structure of uo@xmath0 has been thoroughly characterized by various experiments @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .  ) .",
    "uo@xmath0 is a semiconductor with a 2 ev band gap @xcite and localized @xmath8-electrons that retain strong atomic - like properties . due to significant coulomb interactions and spin - orbit ( so ) effects ,",
    "the ground state of a free u@xmath4 ion is the @xmath9 nonet [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematics](a ) ] .",
    "when the crystal - field ( cf ) of uo@xmath0 s fluorite structure is considered , @xmath9 is split into the ground state @xmath3 triplet and the excited @xmath10 doublet , @xmath11 triplet , and @xmath12 singlet , all approximately 0.15 ev above @xmath3@xcite [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematics](b ) ] .",
    "when cooled below @xmath13 k , uo@xmath0 undergoes a first - order phase transition from a paramagnetic to a transverse type - i antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase @xcite , which exhibits a jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion of the oxygen cage @xcite .",
    "experimental studies now converge on the view that the non - collinear magnetic structure and the oxygen distortion are of the 3-k type @xcite , i.e. , the moment and lattice distortion are both along the @xmath14 direction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](c ) ] , instead of the previously proposed 1-k ( @xmath15 ) @xcite and 2-k ( @xmath16 ) @xcite structures .    on the theory side , the cf model of rahman and runciman",
    "@xcite correctly predicted the @xmath3 ground state of uo@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenstates ] ) .",
    "recent cf calculations have obtained quantitative agreement with experimental excitation spectra by fitting model parameters to the measured data @xcite , by adding corrections to the point charge model @xcite , or by extrapolating from the fitted values for other actinide dioxides @xcite .",
    "models of magnetism in uo@xmath0 , pioneered by the work of allen @xcite , have explored the delicate interplay between multipolar and jahn - teller effects .",
    "first - principles calculations have to go beyond the local - density or generalized - gradient approximations ( lda / gga ) to the density - functional theory ( dft ) to correctly reproduce the insulating character of uo@xmath0 .",
    "existence of an energy gap was demonstrated in ref .",
    "using the hybrid functional method @xcite , in ref .   using the self - interaction - corrected lda @xcite , and in ref .   using the dft+@xmath2 method @xcite .",
    "cf splitting in actinide compounds has been computed by using constrained @xmath1 states without full self - consistency @xcite or by analyzing band positions obtained from lda / gga calculations @xcite .",
    "the 3-k structure of uo@xmath0 was studied by laskowski _",
    "_ using dft+@xmath2 @xcite , but their results showed anomalous dependence on the @xmath2 parameter and both the calculated oxygen distortions and energy differences were about an order of magnitude too large .",
    "furthermore , the 3-k state was only stable with large @xmath2 values and a formulation of dft+@xmath2 that is usually only applied to metals . a first - principles framework for self - consistently and accurately accounting for all the different energy scales in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics ] does not yet exist .    in this paper",
    ", we present a unified dft - based framework for calculating the electronic spectra , magnetism and lattice distortions in uo@xmath0 . explicit @xmath1-@xmath1 interactions and cf effects are treated using a model hamiltonian with parameters derived from self - consistent dft+@xmath2 calculations .",
    "the ground state wave functions that are obtained by diagonalizing this hamiltonian are used to set up initial conditions for self - consistent dft+@xmath2 calculations of magnetism and lattice relaxations .",
    "our approach allows us to accurately reproduce all the different energy scales in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics ] , including the @xmath3 ground state , @xmath17 excited states , as well as the energetics of competing magnetic structures , including 3-k , and their associated lattice distortions , all within a unified self - consistent framework .    before moving on to the details",
    ", we would like to stress that extra care should be taken in first - principles calculations of @xmath1 electrons .",
    "several challenges are encountered in dft calculations of uo@xmath0 ( and other actinide compounds in general ) .",
    "first , strong @xmath1-@xmath1 interactions and a weak crystal field result in an inherently complicated many - body problem . for instance , since 5@xmath18 electrons hybridize weakly with the o 2@xmath19 bands and remain well localized , their true wavefunctions are in general multi - determinantal ( see below for further discussions ) .",
    "second , the higly localized nature of @xmath1 electrons tends to magnify the inaccuracies of approximate exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "we have previously shown that the self - interaction ( si ) error of @xmath1-electrons is highly sensitive to the occupied orbital , and its removal is non - trivial in both the dft+@xmath2 and hybrid - functional methods @xcite .",
    "therefore , an improved version of dft+@xmath2 @xcite is required to remove such errors ( @xmath20 ev ) and access weak cf effects .",
    "third , the existence of a multitude of f - states often leaves dft+u calculations trapped in local minima , leading to difficulties in reproducibly finding the correct electronic ground state . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not uncommon for different authors to find inconsistent and hard - to - interpret results with large errors ( @xmath21 ev or even larger ) even when using identical electronic - structure methods ( see refs .  . and references therein )",
    "it is likely that this issue contributed to the failure of previous studies to reliably examine the 3-k structure of uo@xmath7 . @xcite",
    "previously , we have shown that the local minima issue is also present in hybrid functional calculations @xcite . in this paper , we show that the multiple minima , corresponding to different orbital states , contain valuable physical information about @xmath1-electrons that can be used to help find the true ground state and excitation spectra .",
    "all dft calculations were carried out using the vasp code @xcite , gga - paw potentials @xcite , a cutoff energy of 450 ev , and without any symmetry constraints to allow symmetry - breaking solutions .",
    "crystal field calculations were performed in the primitive cell of one uo@xmath0 formula unit with a @xmath22 @xmath23-point grid .",
    "the lattice and ionic positions were frozen at the experimental fluorite structure for crystal field calculations .",
    "these calculations , as discussed in section[sec : cf ] , are ferromagnetic with one uranium ion per cell .",
    "magnetic structures were calculated in the fcc supercell ( 4 formula units ) using a @xmath24 grid , first without and then with full relaxation .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was self - consistently incorporated for realistic comparison with experiment . to remove the orbital - dependent components of self - interaction errors ( sie ) of @xmath1-electrons",
    ", we use a formulation of the lda+@xmath2 method @xcite by modifying only the exchange term , rather than both hartree and exchange , of the lda : @xmath25 where the orbital - dependent hartree - fock exchange @xmath26 contains a term that approximately cancels the on - site sie in the hartree energy of localized @xmath1-electrons ; the remainder of the lda hartree energy is exact by definition and therefore left unmodified in our approach .",
    "the exchange double - counting term @xmath27 accounts for the lda exchange energy and is given by a linear combination controlled by the @xmath28 parameter of the exchange double - counting in the liechtenstein @xcite scheme and the on - site local - spin - density ( lsd ) exchange , conceptually similar to hybrid functional approaches and serves the purpose of subtracting the orbital - dependence of the lda exchange energy .",
    "as a result , eq .  [ eq : newlda+u ] is self - interaction free to high accuracy .",
    "there is only one adjustable parameter , @xmath2 , in our approach , and the other parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 can be determined at given @xmath2 . as done in ref .  , we choose up to seven @xmath18 ssd states of the u@xmath4 ion that are analytically degenerate without considering spin - orbit , and calculate these states total energy dependence on @xmath29 and @xmath28 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2-degeneracy ] , optimal values of @xmath29=0.6 ev and @xmath30 are obtained at @xmath316 ev that minimize the energy difference , i.e.  the orbital - dependent self - interaction error . these @xmath29 and @xmath28 values",
    "are used throughout the paper .",
    "we use @xmath2=6 ev in this paper and discuss the dependence of the results on @xmath2 in section [ sec : u ] . in the rest of the paper spin - orbit is included .",
    "we consider the following single - ion model for @xmath1-electrons : @xmath32 where the summation runs over @xmath33 electrons for the one - body terms of cubic cf , @xmath34 , and so coupling of strength @xmath35 .",
    "the electronic interaction @xmath36 is parametrized by slater s integrals @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath34 between the basis states indexed by projections of orbital ( @xmath39 ) and spin ( @xmath40 ) momenta are given by @xmath41 y^{l}_{m ' } d \\omega ,   % \\langle m |\\hat{f } | m ' \\rangle & = & -    \\int \\bar{y}_{lm } \\left ( \\lambda_{4 } \\alpha_{4 }   %    + ? ?",

    "is applied : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the orbital and spin @xmath49-factors , respectively .",

[ tab : fn - states ] [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic structure of uo@xmath7 using an aspherical - self - interaction free dft+@xmath2 method coupled with a model hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath3 crystal field ground states , as well as the cf excitation energies are reproduced in good agreement with experiment .",
    "various magnetic structures are investigated with careful initialization of the orbital and magnetic states .",
    "the inter - ionic interactions are found to be weak and largely isotropic . when self - interaction errors are accounted for ,",
    "the 3-k structure is essentially degenerate with other antiferromagnetic configurations and becomes the ground state only when lattice relaxations are considered .",
    "our work demonstrates the usefulness of electronic structure calculations for @xmath1-compounds with proper treatment of self - interaction errors and multiple self - consistent local minima corresponding to different orbital states ; this approach can be readily applied to defect supercells and other @xmath1-compounds .",
