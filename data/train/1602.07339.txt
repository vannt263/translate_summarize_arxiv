    "self - assembly of block copolymers has been an actively pursued field of study because of its wide technological implications @xcite .",
    "depending upon the volume fraction of the components and segregation regime , block copolymers exhibit a range of periodic morphologies such as lamellae , gyroids , cylinders , spheres etc.@xcite as we intend to study symmetric diblock copolymers which order into lamellar structure , the rest of the paper will focus only on this particular morphology .    in the absence of any external field , a symmetric diblock copolymer forms domains of lamellar morphology with various degrees of alignment .",
    "practical applications , however , require complete alignment of the microphase separated domains . in general this can be achieved by application of external fields , primary among them being substrate field @xcite , shear field @xcite and electric field @xcite . since the microphase separation generally takes place on a substrate , it is impractical to assume that the experiments are devoid of surface effects . typically , interfacial energy difference between the two blocks in contact with a substrate ( i.e @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the interfacial energies between a monomer a or b and substrate s ) can cause surface induced ordering resulting in parallel arrangement of the domains with respect to the surface @xcite .",
    "if the copolymer system is confined between two rigid substrate walls , two different interaction cases may be considered , ( a ) the walls are symmetric i.e. both walls attract the same monomer and ( b ) antisymmetric walls i.e. both walls attract different monomers @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the system either forms integral @xmath3 or half - integral @xmath4 number of lamellae , where @xmath5 is the equilibrium lamellar spacing , depending on whether the wall is symmetric or antisymmetric respectively @xcite . if the film thickness is incommensurate with the lamellar spacing , the copolymers are said to be in a frustrated state @xcite .",
    "frustration can be accomodated by deviation of equilibrium spacing from @xmath5 to @xmath6 which is typical in thicker films where the deviation can span over a large number of lamellae @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "frustration in thin films is relieved by a change of configuration from parallel to perpendicular lamellae @xcite as shown in fig . [ fig1](c ) . in the present work ,",
    "we restrict our study to the case of symmetric walls .    electric field , on the other hand is gaining popularity in guiding self - assembly of block copolymers because of the ease with which it can be applied , especially in thin films @xcite .",
    "in contrast to stable parallel configuration in presence of substrate interaction , presence of electric field makes the perpendicular arrangement more stable .",
    "the reason for this can be rationalised in terms of dielectric permittivity mismatch between the two monomer components @xcite . in electrostatics ,",
    "the electric field isolines prefer to pass through the regions of higher permittivity @xcite .",
    "since this is readily achieved in a perpendicular state , the system minimizes its free energy by adopting perpendicular configuration .     a schematic showing the various stable configurations in a symmetric diblock copolymer in presence of parallel walls / substrate ( denoted by hatched lines ) .",

    "a lot of factors can aid or deter the evolving phase morphology in presence of electric field such as the segmental interaction or segregation @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the flory interaction parameter which scales inversely with temperature and @xmath9 is the degree of polymerization ) , the substrate interaction strength and the confinement which can act as geometric barrier .",
    "the copolymers can be easily modulated at low segregation owing to weak segmental interaction between the two blocks @xcite .",
    "the substrate interaction can hinder the alignment process by electric field as then the applied field has to overcome the interfacial interaction @xcite .",
    "confinement ( film thickness ) on the other hand can aid or hinder the alignment process by electric field depending upon its relation with the natural lamella period @xmath5 @xcite .    the existing literature on parallel to perpendicular lamella transition",
    "can be grouped into three categories depending upon the methodology of study : analytical @xcite , experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite . while most of the earlier theoretical work in this regard focus on strong segregation limit ( ssl ) , @xcite literature on weak segregation limit ( wsl ) @xcite is relatively sparse .",
    "a common finding in the ssl is the presence of three stable configurations , namely , parallel , perpendicular and mixed with respect to the substrate .",
    "the mixed structure contains parallel lamellae closer to the substrate and perpendicular lamellae in the middle , depending upon substrate interaction strength and electric field @xcite . if @xmath10 , the electric field causes a direct transition from parallel to perpendicular state @xcite .",
    "however , if , @xmath11 , two critical fields establish in thicker films @xcite . at lower critical field ,",
    "the parallel arrangement changes to mixed morphology , while , on increasing electric field results in perpendicular lamellae @xcite . in wsl ,",
    "the mixed morphology is not predicted and the transition from parallel to perpendicular is direct @xcite .",
    "experimental studies @xcite focusing on intermediate to strong segregation regimes have reported some observations , which do not completely converge with analytical findings .",
    "it is reported that a completely perpendicular arrangement in presence of electric field can only occur when the interfacial energy difference between the two blocks with the substrate is balanced @xcite i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "any mismatch results in a mixed morphology @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the analytical and experimental observations are attributed to the pathway dependence of the alignment process in the presence of an electric field @xcite .",
    "analytical studies on the other hand focus only on the final equilibrium configuration . in reality , however , the microdomains can get kinetically trapped in metastable states and a high activation energy may be needed to reach the stable state .    thus , numerical studies can provide an efficient bridge between the analytical calculation and experiments .",

    "the focus of most numerical studies have either been on mechanism of alignment of ordered domains @xcite or on order - order transition from one morphology to the other in bulk samples @xcite .",
    "the effect of substrate interaction and confinement have not been investigated thoroughly which could significantly alter the phase morphologies and critical electric field for transition .",

    "thus , the primary objective of the present work is to systematically investigate the effect of substrate interaction and confinement on the resulting morphologies .",
    "we adopt a coarse - grained cahn - hilliard approach to study the self - assembly of symmetric diblock copolymers under competing substrate interaction , electric field and confinement .    secondly , one of the serious shortcoming of most previous works involve an approximate solution of the electrostatic field .",

    "the mechanism that leads to the formation of perpendicular lamellae is essentially the same as earlier , i.e local lamellae disruption and coalescence .",

    "this implies that the effect of surface is non uniform over the whole ordering length . as a result ,",
    "when the electric field drives the domain alignment perpendicular to the surface , above a threshold interaction strength @xmath75 , and below a threshold electric field @xmath126 , the substrate interaction dominates near the walls resulting in a few parallel layers . meanwhile the effect of electric field is predominant at the center ( away from the wall ) and is able to induce a change in configuration in this region .",

    ", parallel arrangement is found to be stable in the absence and at low strength of electric fields . at higher electric field strengths ,",
    "the microstructure is a superposition of parallel and perpendicular lamellae as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . because of the small film thickness , the substrate interaction is predominant and electric field is not able to completely eradicate the previous surface ordering phenomenon .",
    "correspondingly @xmath125 saturates to a value of 0 which is midway between parallel and perpendicular configuration .",
    "we construct a phase diagram to summarize the influence of electric field @xmath126 , surface interaction strength @xmath75 and film thickness @xmath101 on the evolving morphologies by classifying them into parallel , perpendicular and mixed category .",
    "we designate the morphology mixed only when there exists at least one completely parallel layer ( @xmath145 since the layers closer to the substrate are one - half of the inner layers ) .",
    "classification based on such criteria will allow us to compare the resulting phase diagram with the analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "any other combination of phases is denoted as hybrid structure .",
    "the resulting configuration stability diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the following points can be appreciated ,    1 .   for a given film thickness ,",
    "the magnitude of applied electric field to induce a perpendicular arrangement increases with increasing magnitude of substrate interaction strength .",
    "any deviation from this generality occurs only for very thin films e.g. @xmath146 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](e ) ) and closer to half - integral lamellar thickness i.e @xmath147 ( in our case @xmath132 , fig .",
    "[ fig10](c ) ) .",
    "2 .   at low strength of substrate interaction ( @xmath148 ) and electric fields ,",
    "parallel arrangement is found to be stable . however beyond a certain critical value of the electric field e.g. @xmath123 corresponding to @xmath99 , the configuration oscillates between perpendicular and parallel configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( a)-(e ) ) .",
    "the present findings accentuate the previous analytical results @xcite . in general : as @xmath101 decreases , the effect of substrate interaction becomes more prominent .",
    "therefore a higher magnitude of electric field is required to induce a transition from parallel to perpendicular configuration . however , for @xmath101 incommensurable with the bulk lamellar spacing ( say @xmath4 ) i.e. halfway between integral lamellar spacings , the free energy of the parallel configuration is maximum and hence a lower electric field can induce a perpendicular transition .",
    "3 .   for unstrained films",
    "e.g. @xmath149 , the critical electric field @xmath150 required for a parallel to perpendicular transition scales as @xmath151 @xcite . though the numerical calculations are carried out at discrete values of electric field , we can still verify this behavior : @xmath150 for h = 0.1 and @xmath130 lies between @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( a ) ) . taking @xmath154 for @xmath130 , @xmath150 for @xmath155 can be calculated to be @xmath156 which lies between the values of @xmath157 and @xmath158 in fig . [",
    "fig10](b ) .",
    "similar trend can be verified for @xmath137 in fig . [ fig10](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "4 .   for higher substrate interaction strengths , i.e @xmath159 , the range of stability of parallel configuration increases with decreasing film thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) , ( e ) ) . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the parallel configuration is more stable .",
    "mixed morphologies are stable only for thicker films ( @xmath160 ) and for higher substrate interaction strength , @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the electric field required for the transition of parallel to mixed morphology , i.e. the first critical field is independent ( or at most weakly dependent due to the discretized nature of the phase diagram ) of substrate interaction strength ( fig . [ fig10](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "however , the second critical field i.e. the field required to convert mixed to perpendicular morphology is dependent strongly upon the substrate interaction strength ( approximately linearly ) .",
    "next , we consider the variation of the critical fields with film thickness for unstrained films ( @xmath162 ) for fixed substrate interaction strengths of @xmath163 ( fig . [ fig10 ] ( a ) and ( b ) )",
    "clearly , both the critical fields depend upon the film thickness .",
    "the dependence of the first critical field , though , is stronger than the second critical field .",
    "interesting morphologies arise at @xmath164 where the film thickness is incommensurable with the lamella period . at low substrate affinities a usual parallel to perpendicular lamellae transition is observed but at higher affinities a wide range of hybrid structures results . the exact nature ,",
    "though , is not clear in the present study .     phase diagram showing the stable arrangement at different magnitudes of electric field @xmath126 and substrate interaction strength @xmath75 for film thickness ( a ) @xmath124 , ( b ) @xmath165 for permittivity values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 . ]      the effect of increasing the dielectric contrast i.e. @xmath168 on the final configuration , will now be discussed .",
    "increasing the contrast between the two blocks implies that the material is more responsive to an applied electric field and , as a consequence , if @xmath169 is large , the resulting phase diagram is governed by the relative mismatch . in the studies",
    "so far , we consider @xmath170 ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) , which are close to the values reported by amundson et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath173 and @xmath167 ) for ps - pmma copolymer .",
    "if we now increase the permittivity difference @xmath174 by selecting @xmath166 and @xmath167 as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the same copolymer system , an increase in electrostatic free energy contribution is expected for the same magnitude of applied field .",
    "we restrict the discussion to unstrained films ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and the corresponding values of the critical electric fields are drastically lowered . according to the analytical calculations",
    "@xcite , this decrease is proportional to @xmath175 . considering the critical electric field to be @xmath154 for @xmath170 and @xmath130 and @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ) , the critical field on increasing the dielectric contrast to @xmath174 according to above equality ( on holding @xmath101 and @xmath75 constant ) yields a critical value of around @xmath176 which complies well with fig . [ fig11](a ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is retrieved for @xmath155 as well .",
    "the nature of the phase diagram changes dramatically and the region of mixed morphology in the phase diagram is diminished . with enhanced dielectric contrast , the dependence of the critical fields on the substrate interaction strength for a given film thickness becomes rather weak .",
    "this is contrary to the behavior at low dielectric contrast where the second critical field ( mixed to perpendicular ) displayed a strong dependency on substrate interaction strength .",
    "however , the dependency of the critical fields on film thickness for a given substrate interaction strengths is similar to that at low dielectric contrast i.e. both fields depend on the film thickness with the dependency of the second critical field being higher than the first .",
    "we conclude the paper with a critical assessment of the results from the present study to the experiments , analytical and scft calculations .",
    "the most relevant experimental study is due to xu et al .",
    "they studied thin films of varying thickness ( @xmath177 ) @xcite . for film thicknesses less than @xmath178",
    ", substrate interaction was found to be dominant resulting in parallel arrangement , even on application of electric field of @xmath179 .",
    "the substrate induced ordering length in their study was about @xmath180 and the segmental interaction or the segregation was @xmath181 .",
    "the segregation in the present work is relatively weaker than their experiments ( @xmath182 ) and ordering length is around @xmath100 ( with lowest substrate interaction strength ) .",
    "the critical field for lowest substrate interaction from our study is of the order of @xmath183 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively for a dielectric contrast of @xmath170 .",
    "the second value is actually quiet high and may well exceed the dielectric breakdown of the material and in such cases only parallel ordering would be exhibited .",
    "we remark that in recent experiments , electric field of the order of @xmath187 have been applied @xcite .",
    "however , if we examine the critical field for enhanced dielectric contrast of @xmath174 ( the same as in experiment ) , the values are around @xmath179 and @xmath188 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively , which are well within experimental range . given a higher segregation in experiments , we can expect the critical fields to be higher than that in the present study .",
    "infact using scft matsen @xcite calculated the critical field to be around @xmath189 for the same experimental conditions of xu et al .",
    "( @xmath174 and @xmath181 ) for @xmath190 , though substrate interaction was not explicitly considered .",
    "moreover if we compare the critical field for @xmath182 from their work , the critical field would turn about to be roughly @xmath191 for dielectric contrast of @xmath174 and @xmath185(fig 5(a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we additionally compare our findings to that of lin et al .",
    "@xcite who studied sphere to cylinder transition . using scft calculations , a complete phase diagram was calculated .",
    "their segregation also corresponds to @xmath182 .",
    "the present work is thus complementary to their study . for weak substrate interaction , the critical field ( maximum value ) calculated by them",
    "is around @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively ( fig . 7 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . considering that sphere to cylinder transition generally takes place at field strength lower than parallel to perpendicular lamella transition , our values of @xmath179 and @xmath188 are quite in agreement with scft calculations .",
    "a similar comparison can also be made at higher substrate strengths .",
    "the calculated phase diagrams are similar in spirit to that by lyakhova et al .",
    "@xcite . in both studies",
    ", the phase diagram is obtained from dynamic microstructure evolution rather than static calculations @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated parallel to perpendicular transition of lamellar morphology using dynamic scft coupled to perturbed solution of maxwell equation for thin films of @xmath194 and segregation of @xmath195 .",
    "mixed morphologies were however not observed in that study . in the present study ,",
    "the system was allowed to evolve from a disordered state under combined electric and substrate field , whilst in the study of lyakhova et al .",
    ", electric field was applied to well developed microstructures .",
    "possible difference can arise because of the initial level of ordering .",
    "our results are qualitatively similar to the results of lin et al .",
    "@xcite who observed the presence of mixed phases in film thickness as low as @xmath186 in cylinder forming systems at a similar segregation .",
    "we next compare our phase diagram to the analytical calculation of tsori et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors computed the phase diagrams both in weak and strong segregation regime .",
    "the results presented correspond to an intermediate regime . though our results are closer to wsl , the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] is similar to the analytical calculation of tsori et .",
    "al in ssl ( fig . 8 and 9 in ref .",
    "we remark that the two phase diagrams correspond to two different segregation regimes and are based on different assumptions .",
    "phase diagram calculated by tsori et al",
    ". corresponds to ssl and is based on the assumption of finite surface ordering length and high dielectric contrast ( @xmath174 as compared to our @xmath170 ) . in wsl , they assumed the ordering length to be greater than the film thickness and mixed morphology was not considered . in the present study , mixed morphology is observed inspite of the ordering length being lower than the film thickness .",
    "we believe that the consideration of finite surface ordering length in context of wsl ( and in the occurence of mixed morphology in particular ) might have been an over assumption .",
    "moreover , only a single intermediate phase i.e. a mixed lamellae morphology was considered .",
    "the results of the present study , however , indicates the presence of other intermediate or hybrid structures , thus altering the phase diagram significantly from analytical theories .",
    "we conclude by briefly discussing the influence of wall interaction characteristics on the equilibrium morphologies . in the present work ,",
    "we have restricted the study to symmetric substrate interaction .",
    "however , in principle two additional cases are possible",
    ". the substrate can be ( i ) antisymmetric i.e. both walls attract different monomers with same strength or ( ii ) asymmetric i.e. both walls have preference towards same or different monomers , but possess different interaction strength .",
    "we believe that the consideration of antisymmetric case may not lead to any new geometries other than the ones reported here .",
    "only the region of their respective occurrence in the phase diagram might change , given that film thickness corresponding to integral number of lamellae spacing would then be the frustrated state and half - integral , the natural state . on the contrary , asymmetric interaction can potentially engender an additional type of mixed morphology , where the system adopts a parallel configuration on one side ( where interaction strength is comparatively higher ) and perpendicular configuration on the other ( where interaction strength is weaker ) .",
    "however , it remains to be seen if the competing electric field can stabilize other morphologies , for instance , cylindrical that has been reported in the present study .    to summarize",
    ", we have studied the morphology evolution of a symmetric diblock copolymer under competing substrate interaction and electric field using a coupled ohta - kawasaki functional and maxwell equation . by solving the full maxwell equation",
    ", we do not assume weak dielectric inhomogeneity , making the model equally applicable irrespective of segregation . a good agreement with the analytical and scft calculations ,",
    "amply demonstrates the predictive capability of the proposed model .",
    "a distinct advantage of coarse graining is the accessability to large scale simulation , especially in three dimension .",
    "moreover , in 3d the nature of mixed / hybrid morphologies are well defined and such a simple classification ( parallel , perpendicular and mixed lamellae ) may not be suffice .",
    "our 2d results does point out that in the incommensurate films in the regime @xmath196 , this interplay of substrate , confinement and electric field leads to rich hybrid structures and even the occurence of a parallel lamellae to perpendicular cylinder transition .",
    "infact in recent experiment on gyroid forming copolymers by crossland et al .",
    "@xcite a large number of coexisting morphologies were observed at low dielectric contrast .",
