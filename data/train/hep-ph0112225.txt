    "<S> in these lectures i want to discuss how the structure functions in deep inelastic scattering relate to quark and gluon correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we will consider the issue of intrinsic transverse momenta of quarks , which becomes important in processes like 1-particle inclusive leptoproduction . </S>",
    "<S> some examples of cross sections and asymmetries , in particular in polarized scattering processes are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the operator structure for azimuthal asymmetries and their evolution . </S>"
