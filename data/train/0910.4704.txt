    "it is believed that opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) networks will be one of the primary forces in combating spectrum scarcity  @xcite in the upcoming years  @xcite .",
    "therefore , osa networks  @xcite have become the topic of rigorous investigation by the communications theory community .",
    "specifically , the assessment of spectrum sensing overhead on osa medium access control ( mac ) performance recently gained a significant attention .      in the osa network performance analysis ,",
    "a description of the relation between the primary ( spectrum ) user ( pu ) network and the secondary ( spectrum ) user ( su ) network can be split into two general models : macroscopic and microscopic . in the macroscopic osa model",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the time limit to detect a pu and vacate its channel is very long compared to the su time slot , frame or packet length duration .",
    "such a time limit is assumed to be given by a radio spectrum regulatory organization .",
    "for example , the timing requirements for signal detection of tv transmissions and low power licensed devices operating in tv bands by ieee 802.22 networks  @xcite ( including transmission termination and channel vacancy time , i.e. a time it takes the su to stop transmitting from the moment of detecting pu ) must be equal to or smaller than 4.1s  ( * ? ? ?",
    "15.5 ) , while the frame and superframe duration of ieee 802.22 are equal to 10ms and 160ms , respectively  @xcite .",
    "also , in the macroscopic model it is assumed that the pu channel holding time , i.e. the time in which the pu is seen by the su as actively transmitting , is much longer than the delay incurred by the detection process performed at the su . as a result",
    "it can be assumed in the analysis that , given high pu detection accuracy ( which is a necessity ) , osa network performance is determined by the traffic pattern of the sus .",
    "that is , it depends on the total amount of data to be transmitted by the su network , the duration of individual su data packets and the number of su nodes . in other words",
    "the pu bandwidth resource utilization by the su is independent of pu detection efficiency .    in the microscopic osa model , more popular than its macroscopic counterpart due to analytic challenges",
    ", the detection time is short in relation to the shortest transmission unit of the osa system .",
    "detection is also performed much more frequently than in the macroscopic model , i.e. for every su packet  @xcite or in every time slot  @xcite .",
    "also , the microscopic model assumes much higher pu activity than the macroscopic model , which justifies frequent detection cycles .",
    "since the detection overhead is much larger than in the macroscopic model , the analysis of utilization of resources ( temporarily unoccupied by pu ) by osa network can not be decoupled from the analysis of the pu signal detection phase .    therefore , while the distinction between macroscopic and microscopic models are somehow fluid , it is important to partition the two cases and compare them in a systematic manner .",
    "more importantly , the comparison should be based on a detailed osa multichannel and multiuser ad hoc network model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.4 ) , which would not ignore the overhead from both the physical layer ( phy ) and mac layers of different cooperative and distributed spectrum sensing strategies  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.1 ) and , in case of microscopic model , account for different channel access procedures and connection management strategies for the sus upon pu detection , like buffering or switching to a vacant channel .",
    "finally , the comparison should be realized using tractable analytical tools .",
    "the literature on this topic can categorized into three groups : ( i ) performance analysis of general osa networks , excluding a detailed model for spectrum sensing ( mostly for the macroscopic model ) , ( ii ) performance of spectrum sensing isolated from mac aspects of network collaboration , and ( iii ) joint performance of spectrum sensing and networking for osa .",
    "one of the first works that gained insight into the general performance of osa networks , considering impact of pu activity on blocking and throughput of the su network was  @xcite , where the capacity of a multichannel osa system was assessed by comparing centrally coordinated versus random su channel assignment . a spectrum sensing process was not considered .",
    "a similar problem was investigated in  @xcite where the spectrum sharing gains for pu and su networks were obtained for a distributed and multichannel ad hoc osa network .",
    "unfortunately , a zero delay spectrum sensing process was assumed with genie - aided channel selection , i.e. in every time slot the receiver knew of the exact channel the transmitter will use to send data  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii - c1 ) .    in later works , assumptions on",
    "the osa network model became more realistic .",
    "specifically , markovian analysis of su traffic buffering on the event of pu arrival was presented for a su exponential service time  @xcite and for a su phase - type service time  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the impact of spectrum sensing detection time overhead on the osa network performance was not investigated and the connection arrangement process for new su arrivals , i.e. method to select and access a channel for a new sender - receiver pair , was assumed to be performed by a centralized entity .",
    "a different option of the above model has been analyzed in  @xcite , with only pu channels dedicated to the osa network and with a mixture of pu and su exclusive channels .",
    "su connection buffering was not allowed , however , su connections were able to switch to an empty su exclusive channel on the event of channel preemption by the pu .    a similar analysis , but with a different channelization structure , where the pu occupied more than one su channel ( contrary to  @xcite ) was performed in  @xcite",
    ". the authors addressed the cases of ( i ) connection blocking , and ( ii ) channel reservation and switching of su connections to empty channels on pu arrival .",
    "this analysis was later extended to the case of finite su population and packet queuing  @xcite , and buffering and switching of su connections preempted by pu arrivals  @xcite .",
    "again , in all papers listed above the spectrum sensing process was assumed to have no overhead and perfect reliability . moreover the connection arrangement process for sus was not considered .    a system where the pu had to wait until a su vacates a channel was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "both perfect and imperfect pu detection processes were considered , however detection overhead as well as a connection arrangement process for the secondary system was not considered . in",
    "@xcite another osa system consisting of only two sus was considered . once again",
    ", su connection arrangement process was not included in the analysis and two distinct strategies were assumed : ( i ) with complete su connection blocking on the arrival of pu ( just like in  @xcite ) and ( ii ) with su connection buffering on the arrival of pu ( just like in  @xcite ) .",
    "spectrum sensing and connection arrangement process was not investigated .",
    "a practical osa model analyzing the impact of pu activities on the quality of voice over internet protocol traffic was analyzed in  @xcite with a system not allowing su connection buffering and perfect information on the pu channel presence assumed .",
    "the only work considering a microscopic model was  @xcite , where a relation between sensing time , pu detectability and different connection arrangement processes were considered .",
    "detailed simulations and markov analysis were performed , however , as noted in the paper , the proposed model did not yield accurate results over the ranges of all parameters considered , e.g. level of pu activity . also , only one sensing strategy with su connection buffering was analyzed for the case of different mac protocols .    considering a second group of papers ( related to the performance of spectrum sensing algorithms in isolation from higher protocol layers ) , in  @xcite the analysis of the average time consumed by two",
    "stage spectrum sensing ( proposed independently in  @xcite ) was decoupled from su traffic characteristics .",
    "moreover the delay caused by exchanging hard decision measurements in the cooperative sensing process based on the `` and '' rule was not included .",
    "the impact of sensing overhead on , e.g. , throughput , and energy consumption was explored in  @xcite .",
    "however the analysis did not account for any osa network and su traffic .",
    "also , the relationship between detection time and detection quality was not investigated . in  @xcite",
    "a microscopic model was analyzed with a sensing period every slot , synchronization between pu and su , and pu stationary over the whole slot duration .",
    "markov analysis was performed only to evaluate the delay incurred while searching for unoccupied spectrum . the sensing process",
    "was not coupled to any of the known mac protocols and su connections .",
    "also , only non - collaborative spectrum sensing was considered .",
    "finally , in  @xcite most of the procedures related to spectrum sensing were categorized and divided into open systems interconnection - like layers .",
    "performance of the most common combinations of sensing algorithms were assessed , but only for the macroscopic model .",
    "our analysis is the microscopic treatment of  @xcite .    considering the final group of papers , when coupling spectrum sensing procedures with link layer protocols",
    ", there is a fundamental tradeoff between sensing time , sensing quality and osa network throughput .",
    "this has been independently found for general osa network models with a single sensing band  @xcite , multiple sensing bands  @xcite with and without cooperative detection and centralized resource allocation , and in a context of mac protocol abstraction  @xcite for a non - cooperative sensing case .",
    "see also recent discussion in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3.1 , 7.3 , and 10.2.4 ) .",
    "this tradeoff will be especially clear , while evaluating microscopic models , since the detection time creates a significant overhead for the data exchange phase .",
    "recently the model of  @xcite was extended to the case of `` @xmath0 out of @xmath1 '' rule in cooperative sensing  @xcite , optimizing parameters of the model to maximize the throughput given detection rate requirements .",
    "unfortunately , the delay caused by exchanging sensing information was not included .      in this paper , we present a unified analytical framework to design the spectrum sensing and the osa data mac jointly , for the macroscopic and microscopic cases .",
    "this design framework provides the ( i ) means of comparing different spectrum sensing techniques plus mac architectures for osa networks and ( ii ) spectrum sensing parameters such as observation time and detection rate for given design options . as a metric for optimization and comparison",
    ", we consider the average link layer osa network throughput .",
    "our model will account for the combined effects of the cooperative spectrum sensing and the underlying mac protocol .",
    "for spectrum sensing , we will consider several architectures parametrized by sensing radio bandwidth , the parameters of the sensing phy , and the parameters of the sensing mac needed to exchange sensing data between individual osa nodes .",
    "along with classifying most of the well known sensing mac protocols , we introduce a novel protocol called truncated time division multiple access ( ttdma ) that supports efficient exchange of individual sensing decisions in `` @xmath0 out of @xmath1 '' fusion rule . for the data mac we will consider two protocol abstractions , ( i ) dedicated control channel ( dcc ) and ( ii ) hopping control channel ( hcc ) , as analyzed in  @xcite with novel extensions .",
    "that is , given the designs of  @xcite , we will analyze mac protocols that ( i ) allow ( or forbid ) to buffer existing su connections on the event of pu arrival , and ( ii ) allow ( or forbid ) to switch the su connections preempted by the pu to the empty channels .",
    "please note that in the case of the analytical model proposed in  @xcite for the su connection buffering osa mac schemes we present an exact solution . finally , using our framework",
    ", we compute the maximum link layer throughput for most relevant combinations of spectrum sensing and mac , optimizing parameters of the model jointly , both for the microscopic and macroscopic models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "system model and a formal problem description is presented in section  [ sec : system_model_problem_description ] .",
    "description of spectrum sensing techniques and their analysis is presented in section  [ sec : ss ] .",
    "analysis of mac strategies are presented in section  [ sec : mac_analysis ] .",
    "numerical results for spectrum sensing process , mac and joint design framework are presented in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "finally the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze link layer throughput accounting for different combinations of mac , spectrum sensing protocols and regulatory constraints .",
    "the model can later be used to optimize the network parameters jointly to maximize the throughput , subject to regulatory constraints . before formalizing the problem , we need to introduce the system model , distinguishing between the microscopic and macroscopic approaches .        for two multichannel mac abstractions considered , i.e. dcc and hcc , we distinguish between the following cases : ( i ) when su data transfer interrupted by the pu is being buffered ( or not ) for further transmission and ( ii ) when existing su connection can switch ( or not ) to a free channel on the event of pu arrival ( both for buffering and non - buffering su connection cases ) . finally , we will distinguish two cases for dcc where ( i ) there is a separate control channel not used by the pu and ( ii ) when control channel is also used by the pu for communication .",
    "all these protocols will be explained in detail in section  [ sec : mac_analysis ] .",
    "we assume slotted transmission within the su and pu networks , where pu and su time slots are equal and synchronized with each other .",
    "the assumptions on slotted and synchronous transmission between pu and su are commonly made in the literature , either while analyzing theoretical aspects of osa ( see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "our model can be generalized to the case where pu slots are offset in time from su slots , however , it would require additional analysis of optimal channel access policies , see for example  @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also note that the synchrony assumption allows one to obtain upper bounds on the throughput when transmitting on a slot - asynchronous interface  @xcite .",
    "the total slot duration is @xmath2@xmath3s .",
    "it is divided in three parts : ( i ) the detection part of length @xmath4@xmath3s , denoted as quiet time , ( ii ) the data part of length @xmath5@xmath3s , and if communication protocol requires channel switching ( iii ) switching part of length @xmath6@xmath3s .",
    "the data part of the su time slot is long enough to execute one request to send and clear to send exchange  @xcite . for the pu",
    "the entire slot of @xmath2@xmath3s is used for data transfer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : slot_micro ] .",
    "our model assumes that there are @xmath7 channels having fixed capacity @xmath8mbps that are randomly and independently occupied by the pu in each slot with probability @xmath9 .",
    "there are @xmath1 nodes in the su network , each one communicating directly with another su on one of the available pu channels in one hop fashion . also , we assume no merging of the channels , i.e only one channel can be used by a communicating pair of sus at a time .",
    "sus send packets with geometrically distributed length with an average of @xmath10 slots for dcc , and @xmath11 slots for hcc  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec iii - c4b ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2.3 ) , where @xmath12 is the average packet size given in bits .",
    "difference between average packet length for dcc and hcc is a result of switching time overhead for hcc , because during channel switching sus do not transfer any data , even though they occupy the channel .",
    "we therefore virtually prolong data packet by @xmath6 for hcc to keep the comparison fair .",
    "every time a node tries to communicate with another node it accesses the control channel and transmits a control packet with probability @xmath13 to a randomly selected and non - occupied receiver .",
    "a connection is successful when only one node transmits a control packet in a particular time slot .",
    "the reason for selecting a variant of s - aloha as a contention resolution strategy was manyfold .",
    "first , in reality each real - life osa multichannel mac protocol belonging to each of the considered classes , i.e. hcc or dcc , will use its own contention resolution strategy .",
    "implementing each and every approach in our analysis : ( i ) would complicate significantly the analysis , and most importantly ( ii ) would jeopardize the fairness of the comparison . therefore a single protocol was needed for the analytical model . since s - aloha is a widespread and well understood protocol in wireless networks and is a foundation of many other collision resolution strategies , including csma / ca , it has been selected for the system model herein .    in each quiet phase",
    "every su node performs pu signal detection based on signal energy observation . since we assume that osa nodes are fully connected in a one hop network",
    ", thus each node observes on average the same signal realization in each time slot  @xcite .",
    "pu channels detected by the su are assumed as additive white gaussian noise with a channel experiencing rayleigh fading .",
    "therefore to increase the pu detectability by the osa network we consider collaborative detection with hard decision combining in the detection process based on `` @xmath0 out of @xmath1 '' rule , as in  @xcite . hence we divide the quiet phase into ( i ) the sensing phase of length @xmath14@xmath3s and ( ii ) the reporting phase of length @xmath15@xmath3s .",
    "the sensing phase is of the same length for all nodes . for simplicity we do not consider in this study sensing methods that adapt the sensing time to propagation conditions as in  @xcite . in the sensing phase",
    ", nodes perform their local measurements .",
    "then , during the reporting phase , nodes exchange their sensing results and make a decision individually by combining individual sensing results .",
    "we will analyze different phy and mac approaches to collaborative spectrum sensing , especially ( i ) methods to assign sensing frequencies to users , ( ii ) rules in combining the sensing results , and ( iii ) multiple access schemes for measurement reporting . in this paper",
    "we do not consider sensing strategies applicable to single channel osa networks  @xcite , two stage spectrum sensing  @xcite , and sensing mac protocols based on random access  @xcite , due to their excessive delay .",
    "we will explain our spectrum sensing approaches in more detail in section  [ sec : ss ] .",
    "further we assume a error channel , for the sensing layer as well as for data layer where probability of error during transmission is denoted as @xmath16 .    finally , we consider two regulatory constraints under which the osa network is allowed to utilize the pu spectrum provided the channel is idle : ( i ) maximum detection delay @xmath17 , i.e. a time limit within which a su must detect a pu , and ( ii ) minimum detection probability @xmath18 , i.e. , a probability with which a osa system has to detect a pu signal with minimum signal to noise ratio @xmath19 .",
    "note that in the event of mis - detection and subsequent su transmission in a channel occupied by pu , a packet fragment is considered successfully transmitted , since in our model transmission power of su is much higher than interference from pu , and regulatory requirements considered here do not constrain su transmission power ( refer for example to ieee 802.22 draft where urgent coexistent situation packets are transmitted on the same channel as active pu  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , maximum transmission power is a metric specific to overlay osa systems  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2.5 and 8.2.1 ) where typically no spectrum sensing is considered .",
    "also we do not consider a metric based on a maximum allowable level of collisions between pu and su .",
    "note that the parameters of the introduced model are summarized in table  [ tab : parameters ] and the abbreviations are summarized in table  [ tab : abbreviations ] .",
    "we assume the same system model as for the microscopic case , except for the following differences .",
    "osa performs detection rarely , and the pu is stable for the duration of osa network operation , i.e. it is either transmitting constantly on a channel or stays idle . in other words",
    "quiet period occurs for multiple time slots , see fig .",
    "[ fig : slot_macro ] . also , since the pu is considered stable on every channel we do not consider all types of osa mac protocols introduced for the microscopic model .",
    "instead we use classical dcc and hcc models proposed in  @xcite with the corrections of  @xcite accounting for the incomplete transition probability calculations whenever osa network occupied all pu channels and new connection was established on the control channel .    [ cols=\">,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to compute the maximum throughput for different combinations of protocols and models , we define an optimization problem . the objective is the osa network link layer throughput @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , considering the regulatory constraints given above we need to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the detection time , i.e. the time to process whole detection operation as described in section  [ sec : clp ] , @xmath23 is the steady state link layer throughput without sensing and switching overhead , which will be computed in section  [ sec : mac_analysis ] , and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sensing and switching overhead , see also fig .",

    "also note that @xmath6 is removed from second condition of ( [ eq : xi ] ) since the switching time is negligible in comparison to inter - sensing time .",
    "to design the spectrum sensing , we follow the approach of  @xcite in which the spectrum sensing process is handled jointly by ( i ) the sensing radio , ( ii ) the sensing phy , and ( iii ) the sensing mac .",
    "using this layered model we can compare existing approaches to spectrum sensing and choose the best sensing architecture in a systematic way . since the parameters of the design framework in ( [ eq : framework ] ) are determined by the choices of individual layers , we describe and parametrize each layer of the spectrum sensing , later describing cross - layer parameters .",

    "the sensing phy analyzes the measurements from the sensing radio to determine if a pu is present in a channel .",

    "we will first describe their operation , later presenting the analysis framework .",
    "we consider two major groups of mac protocols for osa : ( i ) those enabling buffering of the su connections preempted by the pu arrival , and ( ii ) those enabling switching of the su connections to a vacant channel when preempted . in the former group , when the pu arrives the existing su connection will pause at the time of preemption and resume on the same channel as soon as the pu goes idle .",
    "we assume that the su always waits for the pu to finish its transmission .",
    "the case where the buffered su connection expires after a predefined time , not analyzed here , is presented in  @xcite for the centralized network .",
    "we do not consider any channel reservation schemes for potential su connections to be buffered  @xcite .",
    "when buffering is not possible , the preempted su connection is considered as lost and a new connection must be established on the control channel . in the latter group ,",
    "when the pu arrives the existing su connection will look for a new empty channel , to continue transmission . if such a channel can not be found the connection is lost . without channel switching ,",
    "the exiting su connection is lost as soon as the pu preempts the channel .",
    "obviously we can have four combinations of these groups for osa mac , which have all been considered in the analysis : ( i ) with no buffering and no channel switching  @xcite scheme denoted as b@xmath113s@xmath113 , where su connections preempted by pu are lost ; ( ii ) with no buffering and channel switching  @xcite denoted as b@xmath113s@xmath114 , where su connections preempted by pu switch to a free channel and connections that can not find a free channel are blocked ; ( iii ) with buffering and no channel switching  @xcite denoted as b@xmath114s@xmath113 , where su connections preempted by pu are being suspended from the moment of preemption until pu releases the channel ; and ( iv ) with buffering and channel switching  @xcite denoted as b@xmath114s@xmath114 , where su connections preempted by the pu first looks for free channels , and when no free channels are found , the connections are being buffered until pu leaves the channel .",
    "the detailed procedure of distributed channel selection on the event of switching will be described in section  [ sec : nbs ] .",
    "recall that the works referred above consider an osa network with centralized channel management , providing only the upper bound on osa network performance .",

    ". however , in the osa system the su data transfer connections can be terminated or delayed if a pu is detected on their channel , and thus the traffic generated by pu also affects the state transition . moreover , with connection buffering enabled , when a pu is detected on the channel the su does not terminate its connection but rather waits until the pu goes idle .",
    "thus the osa network throughput is influenced by the number of channels that are actually utilized by the sus rather than solely by the number of su data transfer connections .",

    "we will briefly discuss the impact of channel error on the throughput calculations .",
    "channel error impacts the throughput in two ways .",
    "first , error affects throughput when su involved in a connection setup fails to receive a control message from the transmitter . as a result",
    "no connection is established .",
    "second , error affects throughput when su not associated with the current connection setup ( which does not overhear the connection setup from others ) collide later with other users , believing incorrectly it selected a free data channel for communication .",
    "the throughput of dcc is impacted by both effects . on the other hand ,",
    "hcc is influenced only by the first effect .",
    "it is because hcc mac protocol implementations do not posses a separate control channel .",
    "thus no overhearing of connection setup is possible and users with hcc mac protocol select data channel for communication automatically according to a pre - defined hopping sequence . because of the prohibitive complexity of the analysis of the second effect , we focus on the first error case and the hcc .    for hcc ,",
    "the control channel is selected as one of the data channels by a hopping method .",
    "thus , if we assume an error on the control channel , it is reasonable to consider the error on the data channel as well . for the control channel ,",
    "if an error occurs , a connection fails to be established .",
    "thus it is modeled by multiplying @xmath233 by @xmath234 , where @xmath16 is a probability of error in the current time slot . for the data channel ,",
    "different error handling strategies can be considered .",
    "we focus on the two following situations : i ) case e@xmath114 denoting packet punctured by unrecovered errors and ii ) case e@xmath235 denoting transmission termination on error .",
    "[ [ case - e_1 ] ] case e@xmath114 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it can be assumed that when an error occurs on a time slot , the su simply discards that time slot and resumes transmitting the remaining packet fragment from the next correct time slot .",

    "[ [ case - e_2 ] ] case e@xmath235 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it can also be assumed that the connection terminates when an error occurs .",

    "<S> we present an analytical framework to assess the link layer throughput of multichannel opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) ad hoc networks . specifically , we focus on analyzing various combinations of collaborative spectrum sensing and medium access control ( mac ) protocol abstractions . </S>",
    "<S> we decompose collaborative spectrum sensing into layers , parametrize each layer , classify existing solutions , and propose a new protocol called truncated time division multiple access ( ttdma ) that supports efficient distribution of sensing results in `` @xmath0 out of @xmath1 '' fusion rule . in case of multichannel mac protocols we evaluate two main approaches of control channel design with ( i ) dedicated and ( ii ) hopping channel . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to augment these protocols with options of handling secondary user ( su ) connections preempted by primary user ( pu ) by ( i ) connection buffering until pu departure and ( ii ) connection switching to a vacant pu channel . by comparing and optimizing different design combinations </S>",
    "<S> we show that ( i ) it is generally better to buffer preempted su connections than to switch them to pu vacant channels and ( ii ) ttdma is a promising design option for collaborative spectrum sensing process when @xmath0 does not change over time . </S>"
