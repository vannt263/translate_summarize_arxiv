    "the extreme weakness of gravity is usually attributed to the fundamental mass scale of gravity being very much larger than that of the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the standard model provides no understanding of how this enormous difference in scales is stabilized against radiative corrections . despite this gauge hierarchy problem ,",
    "the need for extraordinarily large physical mass scales has been accepted as a central feature in theories of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the unification of the gauge coupling constants at @xmath1 strengthens this view .",
    "furthermore , the absence of flavor and cp violating phenomena , beyond that explained by the weak interactions , has made it all but impossible to construct theories of flavor at accessible energies , and suggests that the fundamental mass scale for flavor physics is very far above the tev scale .    over the last two decades ,",
    "the usual approach to addressing the gauge hierarchy problem has been to modify particle physics between the weak and planck scales .",
    "however , there is another possibility : gravity can be modified at and beneath the tev scale , as was realized in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the fundamental mass scale of gravity can be brought far beneath the conventional planck scale , perhaps as low as a tev , in the presence of sub - millimeter sized new spatial dimensions serving to dilute the strength of gravity at long distances .",
    "these dimensions have not been detected since the standard model fields are localized on a three - dimensional wall , or `` 3-brane '' , in the higher dimensional space .",
    "such a scenario can naturally be accommodated in string theory @xcite , where the wall on which the sm fields live can be a d - brane .",
    "remarkably , despite the profound modifications of physics both at sub - millimeter and tev scales , this scenario is not excluded by any known lab , astrophysical or cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "this realization opens up the possibility that there may be a number of experimentally viable approaches to addressing the hierarchy problem which involve the basic ingredients of modifying gravity at or beneath the tev scale , and localizing matter fields to branes in extra dimensions .",
    "an interesting modification of gravity has been proposed recently @xcite where the gravitational metric describing the 4 usual coordinates of spacetime depends on the location in the extra dimensions .",
    "such metrics result from solving einstein s equations in the presence of brane configurations , and lead to spatial localization of the graviton zero mode in the extra dimensions .",
    "various schemes for solving the hierarchy problem have been based on this @xcite .",
    "all these schemes , and the original scheme with large extra dimensions , share a common feature : we live on a 3-brane located in the extra dimensions in which gravity propagates . from the viewpoint of our 3-brane ,",
    "the fundamental mass scale is the tev scale , and this is the scale at which quantum gravity gets strong .",
    "lowering the fundamental cutoff close to the tev scale obliterates the usual ultraviolet desert in energy scales . on the theoretical side , this seems to destroy the attractive picture of gauge coupling unification .",
    "more pressingly , there are in principle dangerous effects from higher dimension operators now only suppressed by the tev scale giving e.g. disastrously large rates for proton decay .",
    "however , it has been realized that the space in the extra dimensions replaces the old desert as the new arena in which such issues can be addressed .",
    "for instance , the old picture of logarithmic gauge coupling unification close to the planck scale may be mimicked by the logarithmic variation of classical fields in sets of two large dimensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the difficulties associated with higher - dimensional operators can also find a natural resolution using higher - dimensional locality .",
    "indeed intrinsically higher - dimensional ways of suppressing proton decay were proposed in @xcite .",
    "after proton decay , the most serious issue is that of flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "dimensional analysis suggests that the flavor scale should be above @xmath2 from the @xmath3@xmath4 mass difference , and greater than @xmath5 from cp mixing in the neutral kaons .",
    "while this naive estimate can be avoided , it has proved extraordinarily hard to construct theories at the tev scale which provide an explanation for the small flavor parameters .",
    "it is natural to ask whether extra dimensions offer any new possibilities for evading these problems . in @xcite ,",
    "a higher - dimensional mechanism was proposed for generating the fermion mass hierarchy , and preliminary arguments were given to suggest that the fcnc problem could also be avoided .",
    "it is our purpose in this paper to extend and generalize these ideas to realistic and elegant theories of flavor at the tev scale which are safe from fcnc effects .",
    "as we will see , _ it is the physics of extra dimensions that allows us to naturally bring flavor physics down to the tev scale_.    in this paper we therefore study effective theories of flavor with a low fundamental mass scale @xmath6 .",
    "what do we mean by `` effective theories of flavor '' ?",
    "at scale @xmath6 there is a fundamental theory , presumably string theory , which has some low energy effective theory .",
    "it is conceivable that this is just the standard model ; with entries in the yukawa matrices somehow set to the required hierarchical values , and with all higher dimensional operators absent .",
    "we consider this unlikely , but , since we do not know the low energy limit of string theory , we must make some assumptions about the form of the low energy effective theory .",
    "we assume that the effective theory beneath @xmath6 is based on some symmetry group g and has an effective lagrangian @xmath7 where @xmath8 runs over all @xmath9 invariant operators , @xmath10 , @xmath11 labels the dimension of the operator and @xmath12 are unknown dimensionless couplings of order unity .",
    "an example of an operator which leads to a small yukawa coupling for the fermion @xmath13 to the higgs @xmath14 is shown .",
    "this assumption implies that the small dimensionless parameters of flavor physics must arise spontaneously from @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a field of the low energy theory .",
    "we call @xmath16 a flavon field : the effective theory must explain why it has a vev small compared to the fundamental scale . in an effective theory of flavor , given the symmetry group and the field content , and in extra dimensions the brane configuration ,",
    "flavor can be understood in the low energy theory itself .    in section 2",
    "we discuss several difficulties encountered in building theories of flavor at the tev scale in 4 dimensions .",
    "higher dimension operators lead to flavor - changing and cp violating effects which are hard to tame , even with a flavor symmetry .",
    "an abelian symmetry can not prevent enormous @xmath17 mixing , and a non - abelian symmetry results in disastrous flavor - changing ( pseudo- ) goldstone bosons .",
    "even the maximal flavor symmetry , @xmath0 , is not quite sufficient to protect against large electric dipole moments for the electron and neutron . finally , the flavon quanta are themselves very light , and the exchange of these particles in the low energy theory also generates disastrous four fermion operators .",
    "these difficulties are illustrated with a @xmath18 flavor symmetry group .",
    "in section 2.6 we discuss the minimal @xmath0 flavor structure in 4 dimensions , in which the three yukawa matrices are each promoted to a single flavon field .",
    "this structure has been used to argue that flavor physics can occur at a low scale @xcite .",
    "we show that @xmath19 must also be spontaneously broken for the fundamental scale to be under 10 .",
    "however , as it stands , this minimal @xmath0 structure is not an effective theory of flavor .",
    "the flavon fields contain a hierarchy of vevs which are simply imposed by hand and not derived from the low energy effective theory .",
    "this could be remedied by introducing a hierarchy of symmetry breakings at a sequence of scales beneath @xmath6 , as proposed by froggatt and nielson @xcite .",
    "however , this would produce flavons at each of these scales , and some would be very light indeed , and their exchange would induce disastrous flavor and cp violating interactions .",
    "this flavon exchange problem appears generic to effective theories of flavor with low @xmath6 in 4d .    with extra dimensions",
    ", there is a new possible origin for the small flavor parameters : symmetries which are broken strongly on some source brane may be only weakly broken on our brane because the source brane is distant from us @xcite .",
    "this idea is explored in section 3 .",
    "it is most easily implemented by making the flavon field , @xmath16 , a bulk field , which is coupled to a source on the distant source brane so that it has a small vev on our brane .",
    "the obstacles to constructing effective theories of flavor encountered in 4d are immediately removed : there is now an origin for the small parameters in the flavon vev  we have a real theory for the small parameters  and yet this is done without introducing light flavons , solving the flavon exchange problem .",
    "furthermore , with order unity breaking of the discrete flavor group on the distant branes , the pseudo - goldstone masses can be raised to the tev scale .",
    "the origin of this success is to understand flavor from a hierarchy of distances in the extra dimensions , and not from a hierarchy of mass scales in our 4d world . in section 3",
    "we also discuss another phenomenon which is generic in theories of flavor in extra dimensions when the bulk flavon field possesses non - linear interactions .",
    "this means that the flavor breaking felt on our brane is sensitive to the value of the flavon field in the bulk , not just to its value on our brane .",
    "the `` sniffing '' of flavor breaking in the bulk can lead to interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , in section 6 , we study a @xmath20 theory , which incorporates features of the @xmath18 4d theory , and in which sniffing plays a crucial role in symmetry breaking .",
    "in section 4 we construct a complete realistic theory of flavor in extra dimensions with @xmath6 in the region of 5  10 tev .",
    "the flavor group is maximal , @xmath21 , and the minimal set of flavons propagate in the bulk , taking classical values which result from shining from just three source branes .",
    "each source brane breaks a discrete subgroup of each @xmath22 using only triplet vevs , and the three source branes may be identical to each other .",
    "in section 5 we consider a particularly simple brane configuration for realizing this @xmath0 theory : our 3-brane and the three source 3-branes are located on a 4-brane , so that shining occurs in 1 dimension .",
    "this makes the calculation of the yukawa matrix , and the additional flavor changing effects from the bulk , remarkably simple .",
    "in section 6 we study the possibility of a smaller non - abelian flavor symmetry , and introduce a variety of bulk flavons in a way motivated by the observed quark spectrum .",
    "this theory illustrates some of the possibilities opened up for flavor physics in extra dimensions .",
    "for example , a new mechanism for suppressing the neutron electric dipole moment is proposed .",
    "predictive theories of fermion masses can result if the source branes have a symmetrical geometrical configuration , as would be expected in a dynamical theory of brane stabilization . in section 7",
    "we study theories in which the 9 quark masses and mixing angles are given quite successfully in terms of just 5 free parameters .",
    "these theories are inherently extra - dimensional , with the precise predictions reflecting the geometry of the brane configuration , and the location of our three - brane .",
    "in this section we summarize the major challenges to lowering the scale of flavor physics close to the tev scale in theories with four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the difficulties are mostly well - known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but it is useful to have them collected in one place .",
    "the most serious obstacle to lowering the flavor scale @xmath6 comes from flavor - changing neutral currents , most severely from the kaon system . with the coefficients @xmath12 in eqn.([eq : leff ] ) taken to be of unit magnitude with large phases , the bounds on @xmath6 coming from the operators contributing to @xmath23 processes ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) are presented in table [ table : t ] .",
    ".bounds on @xmath6 from @xmath23 processes . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the bounds on @xmath6 from the left - right operators for @xmath26 are enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 due to the qcd enhancement in running from @xmath6 down to the hadronic scale .",
    "there are also bounds on @xmath6 , far above the tev scale , coming from @xmath28 processes such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .      while this may suggest that the scale of flavor should be above @xmath31 tev , it is also possible that whatever is responsible for suppressing the yukawa couplings of the light generations also adequately suppresses the flavor - changing operators .",
    "for instance , if a weakly broken flavor symmetry @xmath32 is responsible for the fermion mass hierarchy , the same @xmath32 could suppress the dangerous operators .",
    "it is easy to see that even this idea fails for generic flavor symmetries .",
    "the reason is that the most dangerous effects arise not directly from operators that _ violate _ @xmath32 , but rather from @xmath32 invariant operators which violate flavor when rotated into the mass basis .",
    "suppose for instance that @xmath32 is abelian with different charges for the first and second generations .",
    "then , the flavor symmetry allows the higher dimension operators @xmath33 with @xmath34 whereas operators of the form @xmath35 will have suppressed coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , when we rotate the fields to go to the mass eigenstate basis , we generate an operator @xmath36 where we have assumed that the cabbibo angle dominantly comes from the down sector . note that unless @xmath37 to high accuracy , this still forces @xmath38 . having the cabbibo angle come dominantly from the up sector helps , but still requires @xmath39 .",
    "the only way out is for @xmath37 , however an abelian flavor symmetry is not enough to enforce equality .",
    "as claimed , we see that the central challenge is to ensure that @xmath32 _ invariant _ operators remain harmless when rotated to the mass eigenstate basis , and this requires @xmath32 to be non - abelian .",
    "if we ignored this issue , in other words if we assume that for some reason these invariant higher - dimensions operators are absent or have their coefficients magically tuned to equality , then even abelian symmetries are enough to adequately suppress fcnc effects from `` directly '' flavor - violating operators @xcite .",
    "for instance , for any abelian flavor symmetry we expect to have the operator @xmath40 and even assuming maximal phase this requires @xmath41 if we take @xmath42 at the lower end of its range , @xmath43 , as is currently favored from the lattice @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that in a two - higgs doublet theory this bound turns into @xmath44 , so we can not tolerate large @xmath45 .    in the sm ,",
    "such higher dimension operators are generated by integrating out @xmath46 at the weak scale , but enormous fcnc s are not generated .",
    "this is because the sm gauge interactions respect the @xmath0 flavor symmetry acting separately on each of the @xmath47 fields , explicitly broken only by the yukawa matrices . in the @xmath0 symmetric limit ,",
    "all the operators are generated automatically with equal coefficients ; this maximal flavor symmetry is strong enough to ensure that _ flavor symmetric _",
    "operators are harmless when rotated to the mass basis .",
    "it is then natural to explore the possibility that the true flavor symmetry is the maximal one @xmath48 , and we will consider this possibility both in the context of four dimensions and in extra dimensions . we find that while it is difficult to believe in a real theory based on @xmath0 in 4d , it is easy to construct elegant theories based on @xmath0 in extra dimensions .    however , there is a strong constraint , even on theories based on a @xmath0 flavor symmetry , coming from electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron .",
    "any flavor symmetry would allow an operator of the form e.g. @xmath49 and if the phase @xmath16 is @xmath50 , this requires @xmath51 from the neutron edm @xcite .",
    "a similar operator in the lepton sector gives @xmath52 from the electron edm . while it may be possible to lower @xmath6 below the @xmath53 barrier by imposing powerful enough flavor symmetries , we can not lower it past @xmath54 without making further assumptions about @xmath19 violation .",
    "we must assume that @xmath19 is primordially a good symmetry , and is broken by the same fields breaking @xmath32 .",
    "this gives a hope that the phases in the mass and edm operators are the same and therefore in the mass eigenstate basis there is no phase in the edm operator .",
    "we have argued that the flavor group , @xmath32 , can not be abelian : controlling flavor changing effects from higher dimension operators points to a large non - abelian flavor symmetry group .",
    "if @xmath32 is continuous the spontaneous breaking produces familons ",
    "flavor - changing goldstone bosons  leading to the very stringent bound @xmath55 gev . gauging the flavor symmetry",
    "allows the familons to be eaten , but the weakness of the breaking then tells us that there will be horizontal gauge bosons with masses much smaller than the fundamental scale , whose exchange leads to flavor changing problems .",
    "the only option is to have @xmath32 be a large , _ discrete _ , non - abelian symmetry .",
    "however , even this case typically is excluded by the accidental occurence of pseudo - goldstone bosons . at the renormalizable level",
    ", the potential for the flavon fields only contains a few @xmath32 invariant interactions , and this typically gives an accidental continuous symmetry , reintroducing goldstone bosons .",
    "higher order operators that respect only the discrete symmetry will give masses to these pseudos which are suppressed by ratios of flavon vevs to the fundamental scale .",
    "moreover , these ratios will be raised to high powers , given the large size of the discrete group , and we are thus left with extremely light pseudo - goldstone bosons that can be produced , for instance , in @xmath56 decays .      in the low energy",
    "effective theory , beneath the fundamental scale @xmath6 , the yukawa couplings are generated by operators of the form @xmath57 if we set all but one of the @xmath16 s and the higgs to its vev , we have an effective coupling to @xmath16 @xmath58 tree - level flavon exchange then generically generates flavor - changing 4-fermion operators that are suppressed only by the _ flavon _ mass and not by the scale @xmath6 .",
    "unless the flavon potentials are fine - tuned , we expect that the flavon masses @xmath59 are of the same magnitude as the vev @xmath60 , which must be smaller than @xmath6 in order to produce small yukawa couplings .",
    "using the same interactions which generate the yukawa couplings , tree - level flavon exchange can generate dangerous 4-fermion operators . of course",
    ", if the flavon masses dominantly respect the flavor symmetry , the induced operators will be flavor - symmetric , and if the flavor symmetry is powerful enough these operators may be harmless .",
    "however , since the flavon vevs themselves break the flavor symmetry at a scale @xmath61 , we expect generically that the flavon masses will have @xmath50 flavor breaking .",
    "the generated 4-fermi operators are clearly most dangerous if the light generation yukawa couplings are generated by a single flavon coupling .",
    "for instance , suppose that the @xmath62 element of the down mass matrix is produced by the vev of a flavon @xmath63 .",
    "then , tree - level flavon exhange can induce @xmath64 operators @xmath65 which forces @xmath6 back above @xmath66 tev from @xmath67 and @xmath24 .",
    "there is a very simple theory , with @xmath68 @xcite , which gives highly successful quark mass matrices , and alleviates the fcnc problem in supesymmetric theories .",
    "however , this theory has been studied for the case of very large @xmath6  what happens when @xmath6 is reduced towards the tev scale ?",
    "we study just the two light generations , which transform as @xmath18 doublets @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "the flavons are in a doublet @xmath71 and an antisymmetric tensor @xmath72 .",
    "the structure of the yukawa matrices follows from @xmath73 whatever triggers a vev for @xmath16 and @xmath74 , we can always choose a basis so that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , yielding the interesting structure @xmath77    while placing the first two generations in @xmath18 doublets goes a long way in erasing dangerous flavor - changing effects , there are higher dimension @xmath18 invariant operators , in particular @xmath78 which give disastrously large contributions to @xmath67 and @xmath24 , forcing @xmath79 tev .",
    "this suggests that more complex models are needed with more than one @xmath18 factor . before discussing such possibilities , however , let us proceed by assuming that for some reason this dangerous higher - dimensional operator is @xmath80 present in the theory .",
    "we now show that , even making this assumption , a 4d @xmath18 theory still requires @xmath81 tev .",
    "the difficulty for the 4d theory is that there are physical states lighter than @xmath82 charged under flavor , the flavons themselves . as an illustration ,",
    "suppose that we generate vevs for @xmath16 and @xmath74 via independent mexican - hat potentials @xmath83 of course , most disastrously , we get goldstone modes from the breaking of the global @xmath18 , and @xmath84 familon would force all the scales above @xmath85 gev .",
    "we should really be considering a large discrete subgroup of @xmath18 , and there will be other terms in the potential that can lift the familon masses . even if this is done , however",
    ", we are still left with light flavons of mass @xmath86 .",
    "the tree - exchange of @xmath74 in particular generates @xmath87 which contains the dangerous @xmath88 operator .",
    "note that the mass of @xmath74 is not @xmath18 violating , and",
    "so we have generated a @xmath18 invariant operator which is nevertheless dangerous .",
    "the coefficient of the operator is real so there is no contribution to @xmath24 , but there is a strong constraint from @xmath67 : to produce the small @xmath62 entries of the yukawa matrices we need @xmath89 leading to @xmath90 tev .",
    "as already mentioned , the largest symmetry group of the standard model lagrangian in the limit of vanishing yukawa couplings is @xmath91 . imposing @xmath0 on the underlying theory",
    "therefore gives the strongest possible symmetry suppression of flavor violating processes in the effective theory . in the simplest realization of @xmath0 ( which we illustrate for the quark sector alone )",
    ", the symmetry is broken by the vevs of a single @xmath92 and a single @xmath93 , transforming as ( @xmath94 , @xmath94 ) under @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the effective lagrangian has the form of equation ( [ eq : leff ] ) , where the flavor and gauge invariant @xmath10 are constructed from @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and standard model fields .",
    "fermion masses , for example , come from the operators @xmath97    having too low a flavor scale @xmath6 leads to conflict with experiment .",
    "strong bounds come from flavor conserving operators such as @xmath98 which give anomalous contributions to the @xmath99 parameter and to fermion couplings to the z boson , and require @xmath100 6 and 7 tev , respectively to obtain bounds on @xmath6 . ] .",
    "other dimension 6 operators that lead to similar precision electroweak limits are listed in @xcite .",
    "atomic parity violation experiments and direct searches at lepii for 4-lepton couplings place only slightly milder bounds of @xmath100 3 tev .    provided these requirements due to flavor conserving phenomena are met , operators that arise due to flavor breaking are relatively safe .",
    "for example , it is impossible to construct higher dimensional operators that induce @xmath101 mixing using only the vev of @xmath93 , because @xmath93 is diagonal in the down quark mass basis ) gives only the leading order pieces in the yukawa interactions , and leaves out operators like @xmath102 , for instance .",
    "however , in spite of the large top yukawa coupling , we find that these additional contributions are not dangerous , and we omit them from our discussion . ] .",
    "one must instead consider operators that involve @xmath92 , such as @xmath103 which in the mass basis contains @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "this gives the @xmath106s @xmath107 piece @xmath108 which leads to bounds from @xmath67 and @xmath24 of @xmath109 .5 and 5 tev , provided the phase of @xmath110 is of order one .",
    "@xmath106s@xmath111 processes give weaker bounds .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.2 , the most stringent bound on @xmath6 arises because , a priori , there is no reason to expect any relations between the phases of the @xmath12 that appear in equation ( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "the yukawa interaction @xmath112 and the electric dipole moment operator @xmath113 can simultaneously be made real and diagonal . however , since these operators coefficients have independent phases , we should expect that the coefficient in front of the edm operator will be complex in the mass basis , and generically , we get a contribution to the neutron edm that is too large unless @xmath100 40 tev . to evade this",
    "bound we must require that cp is a symmetry of the underlying theory , broken spontaneously by @xmath114 vevs . because the same flavon , @xmath93 , gives rise to both the yukawa interaction and the edm operator , spontaneous cp violation guarantees that there is no contribution to the neutron edm at leading order , and the bound on @xmath6 disappears 500 gev . ] .    provided that the scale @xmath6 is larger than roughly 7 tev , and that cp is broken spontaneously , minimal @xmath0 sufficiently suppresses all dangerous operators that arise in a spurion analysis",
    "ideally , though , a flavor symmetry should do more than simply control higher dimensional operators ; it should also accomodate a simple understanding of fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles .",
    "unfortunately , if we insist on a low flavor scale , addressing masses and mixings in the context of @xmath0 becomes problematic .",
    "one might attempt to explain mass hierarchies by introducing a few sets of @xmath114 s that acquire vevs at very different scales .",
    "however , the @xmath0 mechanism for suppressing dangerous operators requires that only a single @xmath93 and a single @xmath92 exist .",
    "if instead there were , say , two of each , then a combination @xmath115 would appear in the down quark yukawa interaction , while a different combination @xmath116 would appear in the down quark edm operator .",
    "there is no generic reason for the second combination to be real in the basis that make makes the first combination real and diagonal ( although it is reasonable to assume that corresponding entries of the two combinations are of the same order of magnitude ) , so the edm bound @xmath117 40 tev returns . similarly , the operator @xmath118 leads to a stringent bound , @xmath1007 tev , coming from the cp violating parameter @xmath24 .",
    "thus we are led to work with only a single set of @xmath114 s , whose hierarchical vevs , we might imagine , arise due to a sequential breaking of the flavor group at widely separated scales . but by adopting this view we encounter the flavon exchange problem problem of section 2.4 : one expects the masses of the various flavons that compose the @xmath114 s to be of the same order of magnitude as their vevs , and thus the masses of the lightest flavons to be much smaller than @xmath6 . unless @xmath6 is quite large ,",
    "these light flavons mediate flavor changing and cp violating processes at unacceptable levels .",
    "what is the origin of the small dimensionless flavor parameters of the standard model ?",
    "all attempts at understanding these numbers have been based on two ideas .",
    "one idea is that these parameters vanish at tree level and are generated radiatively , and that the loop factor is small . in a perturbative theory , with coupling parameters of order unity , the loop factor is of order @xmath119 .",
    "the second idea is that the small fermion mass ratios and mixing angles arise as a ratio of mass scales of the theory , presumably generated dynamically .",
    "such is the situation in froggatt - nielsen type theories and in extended technicolor models .    in theories with extra dimensions , however , another attractive possibility arises .",
    "suppose there are flavor symmetries that are primordially exact on our brane , but which are strongly broken on a distant brane .",
    "if bulk fields charged under these symmetries are present , this symmetry breaking is `` shined '' from the distant branes @xcite , and there is a new origin for the small parameters , namely , the large volume in the extra dimensions .",
    "the fermion mass ratios and mixing angles are small not because of small breaking on the distant branes , but rather due to the flavor breaking messenger s propagation over large distances across the bulk .",
    "fundamentally , the origin is again one of a ratio of mass scales .",
    "however , these are set by the distances in the brane configuration , and result in completely new physics possibilities different from other scenarios .",
    "effects of this shining can be grouped into two categories : spurion effects arising from the free classical theory , and classical and quantum `` sniffing '' effects , arising from nonlinearities in the lagrangian .",
    "the basic shining effect can be understood as the classical , free propagation of the flavon field through the bulk . from the viewpoint of physics on our brane ,",
    "the flavor breaking is at this level equivalent to classical spurion effects .",
    "we assume that there is some flavor symmetry group @xmath32 , which acts on the matter fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 specify the representations under which the fields transform .",
    "we further assume that @xmath32 is broken at order one on some distant brane by a source @xmath123 to be that of a scalar field living on the symmetry breaking brane .",
    "later , for simplicity , we will set @xmath123=1 . ] .",
    "if @xmath123 couples to some bulk field , then that field can mediate the flavor symmetry breaking to our wall .",
    "for example , suppose the lagrangian is transform as a reducible multiplet under @xmath32 for the sake of generality .",
    "in an actual model there may be many @xmath114 fields , each transforming as an irreducible multiplet . ]",
    "@xmath124 where the symmetry is broken on a @xmath125-brane at location @xmath126 in the extra dimensions , and where @xmath127 is the fundamental scale . since the source brane is an extensive object , it acts as a point source for a yukawa potential in @xmath128 dimensions .",
    "this is completely analagous to a charged plate in 3 dimensions being described as a point source in 1 dimension .",
    "knowing this , it is simple to write down what the profile of the @xmath114 field is as a function of @xmath129 ( neglecting nonlinear interactions ) , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the distance from the source brane to the point in question , @xmath132 is the modified bessel function , and @xmath128 is the codimension of the source of @xmath114 in the space in which @xmath114 propagates . for @xmath133 ,",

    "for example , with @xmath48 the flavon fields @xmath138 appear as single multiplets on our wall , and yet the various entries can have values which are hierarchical .",
    "flavor breaking from extra dimensions is much more interesting than simply taking the values of @xmath114 and its derivatives on our brane at @xmath139 and using them in a spurion analysis .",
    "non - linearities in the bulk lagrangian can induce a wide variety of effects which probe flavor breaking at non - zero @xmath129 .",
    "the simplest examples of this are classical non - linear effects .",
    "one of the most significant is the generation of a vev for a bulk field without a direct source brane .",
    "consider a situation with two source branes , with sources @xmath140 and @xmath141 and two bulk fields which have vevs generated on these branes , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "if there is , in addition , another bulk field @xmath144 transforming as a product representation of the 1 and 2 representations , we naturally have a term in our lagrangian @xmath145 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath16 will also take on a vev in the bulk , and hence on our wall as well .",
    "this is a very familiar situation , even in four dimensions .",
    "however , in four dimensions , we typically expect a value @xmath146 . in extra dimensions",
    ", the vev can typically be much larger . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sniff ] , the fact that the source for @xmath16 is spread throughout the bulk means that the dominant contribution to its shining can come from a region distant from our brane , defeating our four - dimensional intuition .    formally , we want to sum the contributions to @xmath16 on our wall from every point in space .",
    "given the assumed coupling , if we take our wall at @xmath139 , and the sources for @xmath147 and @xmath148 at @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively , we can then calculate @xmath151 if the propagators",

    "if they are even an order one factor lighter than the fundamental scale , the volume will typically be larger than one by a factor @xmath155 .",
    "we illustrate this with the following example :    0.25 in    consider a brane configuration with our brane localized at @xmath156 in three extra dimensions , while one source brane is at @xmath157 and the other at @xmath158 in units where @xmath159 .",

    "this is very sensitive to the brane geometry and the masses of the bulk fields , of course , and the predictivity suffers as a consequence .",
    "however , it illustrates one very important difference between flavor model building in extra dimensions versus that in the usual four .",
    "once a bulk vev for a field exists , it can act to further regenerate another field that may fall off more quickly . in the previous example , if we reach a region where @xmath169 , then this region can act as a further source for @xmath148 , dominating for some regions of @xmath129 over the source brane .",
    "this can be understood rather simply : in situations where the vev profile is dominantly exponential , ( i.e. , when @xmath170 ) , and if further @xmath171 , it can be advantageous to exploit the presence of @xmath147 , for instance , and propagate as a @xmath16 , as we illustrate in [ fig : nlints1](a ) .",
    "of course , if the regenerated value of @xmath148 is sufficiently large , it can again regenerate @xmath16 in certain circumstances and the nonlinearities can dominate the entire problem .",
    "it is important to be aware of this when employing non - linear effects in model building .",
    "all of the effects discussed so far arise from classical field theory in the bulk .",
    "they could be obtained , in principle , by solving the non - linear classical fields equations .",
    "quantum effects in the bulk may be just as , if not more , important .",
    "for example , if @xmath172 , it may be advantageous to pay the price of a loop factor and propogate as a @xmath173 loop , which is shown in the `` tie - fighter '' diagram of figure [ fig : nlints1](b ) .",

    "henceforth , we will often make similar approximations in discussions of sniffing . ]",
    "this quantum effect can lead to a very large deviation of @xmath180 from @xmath185 , since it involves only one power of @xmath186 .    for the case of @xmath187 and an operator on our brane involving @xmath188 , in addition to the tree contribution",
    "there is the 1-loop contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlints3]a , equal to    0.25 in    0.25 in    @xmath189    in this case , two propagators traverse the whole space from @xmath190 to @xmath139 in both tree and loop diagrams , so it may appear that the loop correction is small and unimportant .",
    "however , in theories of flavor , we will find that the loop diagram contains flavor breaking not present at tree level .",
    "for instance , if @xmath16 transforms as a multiplet of @xmath32 , it may point in different directions in flavor space at different @xmath129 ; this is a situation which arises when multiple source branes are present . at tree level",
    "the only flavor breaking is given by @xmath191 , whereas at the loop level the flavor breaking of @xmath192 is also probed .",
    "we say that additional flavor breaking is `` sniffed '' in the bulk from points @xmath193 .",
    "in addition to quantum corrections to @xmath194 , there can be classical corrections as well . by integrating out a @xmath16 field which interacts in the bulk",
    ", we generate local operators as we illustrate in figure [ fig : nlints3](b ) . in this particular example , given operators @xmath195 and @xmath196 , we generate a local operator @xmath197 .",
    "absent bulk corrections , this operator would have a coefficient @xmath198 , but sniffing contributions can change this . although both @xmath16-legs on our wall are evaluated at the same point in spacetime , this is not a quantum effect and does not receive the same loop suppression as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlints3](a ) .",
    "the bulk flavon fields have @xmath129 dependent profiles , and ,",
    "because lorentz invariance is violated in directions perpendicular to our brane , one might imagine that wherever a @xmath114 field appears in the lagrangian of our brane , we could just as easily write @xmath199 , with no need to contract indices of extra dimensional derivatives @xcite . unless the @xmath114 mass were much smaller than the scale @xmath6 , the derivative terms would not be strongly suppressed . nor would @xmath114 and its derivatives necessarily be proportional to each other , since the field can have sources on several branes , potentially leading to a variety of troublesome flavor changing effects .",
    "however , if lorentz invariance is broken _ spontaneously _ ( as is the case if standard model fields are localized on a d - brane , for instance ) , only certain derivative terms are allowed .",
    "in the low energy effective theory , we simply have sm fields localized to our brane , the bulk @xmath114 field , and the goldstones of spontaneously broken translational invariance @xmath200 , which give the position of our brane in the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "thus , all terms involving derivatives of a single power of @xmath114 must feature either @xmath201 for some integer @xmath202 , or a brane tension - suppressed coupling to the goldstone . for instance",
    ", we can have terms like @xmath203 but not something like @xmath204 because extra - dimensional derivatives with uncontracted indices amount to _ explicit _ breaking of lorentz invariance .    of course , the localized fields have finite profiles in the bulk , and we can contract derivatives of @xmath114 with derivatives of wall fields in the full extra - dimensional theory .",
    "however , the effective field theory argument just given indicates that in our wall s low energy theory only terms involving @xmath205 will be generated .",
    "it is straightforward to see how this comes about explicitly from a microscopic description .",
    "let us label the @xmath206 dimensional spacetime coordinates as @xmath207 , where @xmath208 are the 4d coordinates on our brane , and @xmath209 are the coordinates of the extra @xmath128 dimensions .",
    "we will use an index @xmath210 that runs over all @xmath206 dimensions . consider the lorentz invariant term @xmath211 we assign the standard model fields @xmath212 gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions , so that their relation to the canonically normalized fields in 4d is @xmath213 while the @xmath214-independent bulk flavon vev is given by @xmath215 in terms of the canonically normalized fields , ( [ eq : li ] ) becomes @xmath216 where we have neglected factors of @xmath217 and 2 .",
    "after integration by parts , the piece involving @xmath114 becomes @xmath218 this is of the form @xmath219 , which is equivalent to @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the fourier transform of @xmath222 . in our case , we have @xmath223 , with @xmath224 and @xmath225 real , which satisfies @xmath226 with real coefficients @xmath227 .",
    "although there can be many @xmath114 derivatives that appear in the yukawa interaction , we see that they are all proportional to @xmath205 for some integer @xmath202 and thus , by the equations of motion , all proportional to @xmath114 itself .",
    "in contrast , an operator like @xmath228 where @xmath229 is an operator of standard model fields , can not be brought into a form involving only @xmath230 .",
    "the presence of these operators has model dependent effects which we will discuss in later sections .      as discussed in section 2.4 , breaking flavor symmetries at low @xmath6 in four dimensions generates harmful flavor - changing operators through the exchange of flavons , due to the smallness of the flavor - breaking scales relative to the fundamental scale . in sharp contrast",
    ", there is no reason in extra dimensional theories to expect that the bulk flavon masses are closely related to the sizes of the yukawa couplings , as these small parameters are no longer ratios of mass scales .",
    "however , even if the bulk fields _ were _ very light , the harmful operators still receive no subsequent enhancement .",
    "this is due to the ir softness of bulk propagators in extra dimensions .",
    "returning to the example of section 2.4 , let us suppose that @xmath63 lives in @xmath11 extra dimensions",
    ". then , the coefficient of the induced 4-fermi operator is ( working in units with @xmath231 ) @xmath232 note that we integrate over the extra dimensional momenta @xmath233 since this momentum is not conserved .",
    "the important point is that for @xmath234 , this integral is dominated in the @xmath235 and is insensitive to @xmath59 !",
    "therefore , the generated operator is _ not _ enhanced by @xmath236 factor .",
    "in fact , the dominant contribution is @xmath237 independent and generates a flavor - symmetric operator suppressed by powers of @xmath127 and additional loop factors .",
    "sub - dominant contributions need _ not _ respect the flavor symmetry , but are small enough ; the leading corrections go as @xmath238 where @xmath239 is a loop factor .",
    "we can also return to the example of our toy @xmath18 theory discussed in section 2.5 .",
    "the tree - level exchange of a _ bulk _ @xmath74 field produces the operator @xmath240 there is no inverse dependence on the @xmath74 mass at all , and we can therefore tolerate @xmath241 tev , roughly three orders of magnitude below the bound on @xmath6 in the 4d case .",
    "having introduced the shining of flavor breaking from distant branes , we now discuss the construction of @xmath0 models in extra dimensions . in the models we will describe , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( which in this context are bulk fields ) will be the only flavons that couple directly to the standard model fields of our 4d universe , just as in minimal @xmath0 in 4d .",
    "the authors of @xcite have applied the shining framework described in section 3 to the case of @xmath0 . in their picture ,",
    "@xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) couples to nine source fields @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "each of these source fields transforms as @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and is localized on its own distinct brane .",
    "the sources acquire vevs of the form @xmath244 that is , each of the nine @xmath245 sources essentially shines a single element of the down quark mass matrix , and similarly for the up sector .",
    "the magnitude of each source is taken to be roughly @xmath6 , but large fermion mass ratios are still possible by requiring some source branes to be closer to our brane than others .",
    "this represents a significant improvement over the minimal case in 4d : only a single @xmath93 and a single @xmath92 appear in the yukawa interactions , and yet a simple explanation for the hierarchical nature of the fermion masses is achieved .",
    "this picture is far from complete , however .",
    "the most serious deficiency is that no understanding is provided of why @xmath246 .",
    "related to this is the fact that the vevs of ( [ eq : vev ] ) do not comprise a justifiable starting point , as we will now argue . to avoid problems with goldstone bosons , we work with a large discrete subgroup of @xmath0 rather than with @xmath0 itself ( because the breaking is order unity , we avoid the light pseudo - goldstone bosons that appear in the 4d case ) .",
    "the directions of the eighteen @xmath247 and @xmath245 vevs are thus fixed in various directions that do not depend on bulk dynamics .",
    "the important point is that there is no reason for the direction of a source on one brane to be related in any particular way to the direction of a source on another .",
    "this reasoning argues against the arrangement of vevs in ( [ eq : vev ] ) , and more generally , it tells us that we should expect order unity ckm mixing angles if all the sources are on separate branes .",
    "suppose , for example , that a @xmath247 localized on one nearby brane breaks @xmath248 , while on another brane , a @xmath245 independently breaks @xmath249 .",
    "we imagine that these branes are the ones nearest us , so that these @xmath16 s shine the leading order contributions to the quark mass matrices .",
    "the @xmath250 symmetry allows us to take @xmath251 and then , using the @xmath252 symmetry , we can write write @xmath253 where the form of @xmath254 is fixed by the explicit breaking .",
    "the point is that there is no reason for @xmath247 and @xmath245 to choose the same unbroken @xmath255 , and there is not in general a basis in which both @xmath247 and @xmath245 are diagonal , because the @xmath256 freedom is used up entirely in diagonalizing either one or the other .",
    "generically , we expect the ( 23 ) entry of @xmath247 to be roughly as large as its ( 33 ) entry symmetry respected by @xmath245 , the ( 13 ) entry can be made to vanish .",
    "] , and since the leading order form of @xmath257 on our brane is simply proportional to @xmath247 ( @xmath245 ) , we should expect a large ckm mixing angle , contrary to what is observed .",
    "we now describe a model that retains the successes of the picture just described , but which in addition predicts small mixing angles .",
    "the model is remarkably simple .",
    "we assume the existence of a series of source branes , each of which has localized on it a triplet under @xmath256 , a triplet under @xmath252 , and a triplet under @xmath258 .",
    "nothing special distinguishes any of the source branes - we will even assume for simplicity that they are identical copies of each other - except that they are located at different distances from our brane .",
    "the three triplets on each brane acquire vevs near the fundamental scale and act as sources for bulk flavons @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we again regard the true flavor group as a large discrete subgroup of @xmath0 to avoid goldstones , so the potential for each triplet features a discrete series , rather than a continuum , of minima .",
    "each triplet s vev is stuck at one of these minima , unable to tunnel from one to another . moreover ,",
    "the directions chosen by the sources on one brane are not related in any particular way to the directions chosen on a different brane .",
    "what we have , effectively , is explicit breaking on each source brane , with the triplets getting fixed , complex vevs that point in uncorrelated directions .",
    "let us work out the implications of this simple scenario .",
    "on the brane nearest ours , the triplet sources acquire vevs that , if we exploit our @xmath259 freedom , we can write as @xmath260 with @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 real and not much smaller than @xmath127",
    ". in fact , these sources could even be localized on _ our _ brane .",
    "the bulk flavons are shined by the triplet sources due to the brane interactions @xmath264 consider , for the moment , the extreme case in which this brane is by far the closest one to our ours - the closest by so much that , on our wall , we can ignore contributions to flavon vevs coming from all other sources .",
    "in contrast to the example that led to the alignment problem of equations ( [ eq : diag ] ) and ( [ eq : nondiag ] ) , both @xmath92 and @xmath93 are shined from the same nearby brane , and simultaneously take the form @xmath265 now let us consider the additional contributions to @xmath266 that are shined from more distant sources .",
    "the vevs of ( [ eq : brane1 ] ) respect a residual @xmath267 symmetry that can be used to write the sources on the second nearest brane as @xmath268 where we assume for simplicity that @xmath269 is the same in the various discrete minima .",
    "after we include the effects of the shining interactions @xmath270 the flavon vevs on our brane take the form @xmath271 with @xmath272 . at this stage ,",
    "the vevs in ( [ eq : brane1 ] ) and ( [ eq : brane2 ] ) still admit a @xmath273 symmetry that can be used to write the sources on the third brane as @xmath274 including the effects of this brane , we arrive at the yukawa texture @xmath275 which features both a hierarchy of eigenvalues and small mixing angles .",
    "this model features a simple symmetry breaking pattern . if we include only the nearest brane , its sources break @xmath276 .",
    "bringing the second brane into the picture then breaks @xmath277 .",
    "finally , moving the third brane into place breaks @xmath278 nothing .",
    "note that this breaking pattern is not put in by hand , but rather follows inevitably from the fact that the sources transform as triplets and acquire fixed vevs pointing in random different directions .",
    "note also that we work with three source branes only because this is the minimal set required to break @xmath259 entirely . given that at least three exist , the success of our picture is insensitive to how many branes there are in all .",
    "additional branes , being further away , will give small contributions to the yukawa couplings , leaving the texture of equation ( [ eq : texture ] ) unchanged .",
    "the yukawa texture suggests the approximate relations @xmath279 , which work reasonably well for all mixing angles except for @xmath280 .",
    "the fact that @xmath280 naively comes out to small is not a serious problem , because the entries of ( [ eq : texture ] ) come with unknown coefficients of order 1 due to the unknown angles @xmath281 , @xmath16 , @xmath282 , that appear in equations ( [ eq : brane2 ] ) and ( [ eq : brane3 ] ) : by taking @xmath283 we obtain the correct size @xmath284 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the more closely _ aligned _ the source triplets on the second and third branes are , the _ larger _ @xmath280 is . in sections 6 and 7",
    "we consider different models that accomodate @xmath280 more easily .",
    "it is advantageous to give the flavons slightly different masses , with @xmath285 , to explain why the mass hierarchies are stronger for the up quarks than for the down quarks .",
    "doing so makes all the more pressing the question of why @xmath286 , given that these masses are essentially shined from the same brane . having two higgs doublets with",
    "large @xmath45 leads to flavor changing problems , as we will see below .",
    "a simple alternative that leads to no phenomenological difficulties is to have a @xmath287 suppression of @xmath263 relative to @xmath262 .",
    "even irrespective of flavor changing issues , this approach may be more appealing than a non - susy large @xmath45 scenario , because here the different - sized vevs are given to two fields , @xmath288 and @xmath289 , that transform entirely differently under the flavor symmetry .",
    "in contrast , if we have two higgs doublets , @xmath290 and @xmath291 transform identically under the gauge symmetry and are both flavor singlets , so it is especially difficult to understand how one is chosen to have a much larger vev than the other .",
    "a more interesting approach to understanding @xmath292 will be described in section 7 .",
    "the details of how the present @xmath0 model can give realistic fermion masses and mixings are important but should not obscure the central point : having source triplets with uncorrelated vevs leads _ automatically _ to a ckm matrix with small mixing angles .",
    "another attractive feature of this model is that it violates cp spontaneously , as the vevs of equations ( [ eq : brane2 ] ) and ( [ eq : brane3 ] ) give the off - diagonal elements of @xmath293 order unity phases .",
    "if we impose cp as a symmetry of the underlying theory , this model exhibits the same solution to the edm problem described in section 2.6 in the context of @xmath0 in 4d .",
    "the only question is whether there are additional challenges in suppressing dangerous operators , now that we are working in extra dimensions .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , physics in our 4d universe can be sensitive not only to the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 on our brane , but also to their values away from our brane , due to `` sniffing '' effects .",
    "for instance , if we have bulk couplings @xmath294 , and @xmath295 , then in the up quark edm operator we can replace the matrix @xmath296 with @xmath297 or with @xmath298 where we have included loop factors from integrating over 4d momenta .",
    "diagrams representing these contributions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nlints3]a and [ fig : nlints2]b , respectively .",
    "because they do not have the same flavor structure as @xmath92 , we need to check that these contributions are not problematic .",
    "the largest contribution to the 1 - 1 entry comes from the piece of ( [ eq : oneloop ] ) proportional to @xmath299 , @xmath300 @xmath301 is largest near our brane ( @xmath302 ) , but in this region @xmath303 nearly vanishes in the mass diagonal basis . on the other",
    "hand,@xmath304 is largest near the third most distant brane , located at @xmath305 . using the short distance form for the propagator to evaluate @xmath306 in this region",
    ", we get a contribution of roughly @xmath307 where @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and 1 for @xmath310 2 or 3 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 respectively , and where @xmath313 is the surface area of the unit sphere in @xmath128 dimensions .",
    "the potential mild enhancement from @xmath314 can not nearly compensate for the extra factor of @xmath315 relative to what we have for @xmath316 , so this contribution is harmless . sniffing contributions to the down quark edm",
    "are similarly suppressed",
    ".    sniffed versions of @xmath317 yield @xmath106s @xmath107 operators with coefficients of approximate size @xmath318 and @xmath319 respectively .",
    "again concentrating on the region around @xmath305 , we estimate the integrals as roughly @xmath320 .",
    "if the coefficient were simply @xmath321 , @xmath24 would require @xmath322 tev . since these contributions are further suppressed by either a loop factor or by @xmath323 , they are safe .",
    "a different challenge posed by the extra dimensions involves the bulk flavon derivatives described in section 3.3 .",
    "if we allowed all flavor invariant terms with extra dimensional derivatives acting on @xmath93 , then in the basis that diagonalized and made real the down quark yukawa interaction @xmath324 the edm operator @xmath325 would in general be complex , leading to the familiar edm bound @xmath117 40 tev .",
    "however , as discussed in section 3.3 , the only drivatives of @xmath93 allowed in equations ( [ eq : yukd ] ) and ( [ eq : edmd ] ) are those of the form @xmath326 , provided lorentz invariance is broken spontaneously . in this case",
    "derivative terms are harmless as far as edm s are concerned . on the other hand , the operator @xmath327 can not be brought into a form involving only @xmath230 . because @xmath328 is not in general proportional to @xmath93 ,",
    "the most pessimistic view is then that @xmath24 forces us to take @xmath322 tev .",
    "( in fact , at this point it becomes clear why using large @xmath45 to explain @xmath286 is disasterous : the @xmath106s @xmath107 piece of ( [ eq : deriv ] ) has a coefficient that is proportional to @xmath329 ) .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath322 tev interpretation assumes that the derivative terms are entirely unsuppressed : if @xmath330 , for instance , then the bound is reduced by a factor of @xmath331 . also , it is conceivable that @xmath332 _ is _ nearly proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "for example , if the source branes lie along along the same direction from ours , then in the case of three extra dimensions , the derivative contributions that are not proportional to @xmath93 are suppressed by factors of @xmath333 relative to the leading non - derivative contribution , where @xmath334 are the various distances of the source branes from our brane .",
    "@xmath335 mixing is most sensitive to contributions shined from branes responsible for the light quark masses .",
    "taking @xmath336 for these branes , and @xmath337 , we find that the bound on @xmath6 is reduced by a factor @xmath338 .",
    "the general point is that bounds derived by considering terms involving flavon derivatives are softer than those obtained from operators without derivatives , as they are more sensitive to the flavon mass , and to the details of the brane configuration .",

    "next we will show that specific models can be safe at this scale without qualification .",
    "in particular , we present what we consider the simplest specific realization of our @xmath339cp scenario , and find that regardless of how lorentz invariance is violated , and regardless of whether @xmath341 is suppressed relative to @xmath6 , both flavon derivative and `` sniffing '' effects are harmless .",
    "here , we will consider a concrete arrangement of branes in our @xmath0 scenario .",
    "the arrangement is very simple and furthermore allows analytic calculation of fcnc effects .",
    "we will see that the potential flavor - changing effects are very suppressed by this particular set - up ; for instance all @xmath114 derivatives are exactly aligned with @xmath114 .",
    "we imagine that even though there are @xmath342 extra spatial dimensions , flavor is associated with only one of them , which we parametrize by @xmath129 .",
    "our 3-brane and several source 3-branes are taken to lie in a 4-brane described by ( @xmath214 , @xmath343 ) , where we compactify on an interval @xmath344 $ ] ( rather than a circle ) of moderately large size , @xmath345 .",
    "the 3-branes are spread out roughly evenly in the space available to them and are then naturally spaced between @xmath346 times @xmath347 , so that the question of what determines the sizes of the inter - brane separations is to some extent obviated .",
    "the flavon @xmath114 is taken to propogate only on this 4-brane .    in one infinite extra dimension ,",
    "the @xmath114 propagator is just @xmath348 . when the dimension is compactified , the propagator depends on the boundary conditions .",

    ". therefore , even allowing for heavy @xmath363 and explicit lorentz violation in the extra dimension , there are no problems with derivative terms . in the absence of interactions in the bulk ,",
    "the fcnc analysis is identical to the standard @xmath0 spurion analysis .    in four dimensions ,",
    "@xmath364 with minimal flavons leads to exact lepton flavor conservation .",
    "as we have discussed , in higher dimensions , derivative operators have the potential to induce some level of flavor changing , but in this simple realization of @xmath364 , where @xmath365 , one might expect again that flavor changing is absent .",
    "this intuition is incorrect , as sniffing effects give us sensitivity to the value of @xmath114 in the bulk , and thus to regions where it is not diagonal in the mass basis .",
    "however , it is easy to see that these effects are highly suppressed .",
    "we can illustrate this by considering the process @xmath366 , which occurs due to the presence of the operator @xmath367 in addition to the spurion contribution , which is diagonal in the flavor basis , we have the sniffed contribution @xmath368 if we assume a brane geometry where our brane is at @xmath139 , and the @xmath369 and @xmath370 branes are at positions @xmath371 , the sniffed contributions from the region @xmath372 will all be proportional to @xmath114 .",

    "we calculate the coefficient of the operator to be    @xmath374    which gives a completely unobservable rate for @xmath375 .",
    "thus , while sniffing does allow for flavor violations even in a @xmath0 theory ( where naively lepton flavor is conserved ! ) , they are easily small enough to be harmless .",
    "in the previous two sections we developed extra - dimensional models of flavor with low @xmath6 and @xmath376 .",
    "one might wonder how difficult it is to work instead with smaller flavor groups .",
    "for instance , we have already seen that taking the symmetry to be @xmath18 is problematic : the extra dimensions alleviate the flavon exchange problem , but the @xmath18-invariant , non - renormalizable operator of equation ( [ eq : badop ] ) forces @xmath377 tev . of course",
    ", we could hope that this operator is simply not generated by the underlying theory , but if one wants to assume that all invariant operators are present , then we need a larger symmetry . here",
    "we adopt the group @xmath267 and consider the quark sector alone .",
    "we again take cp to be a symmetry of the underlying theory in hopes of evading the edm bound .    with this choice of flavor symmetry both @xmath378 and @xmath379 are flavor singlets , so to explain @xmath380 , we might require two higgs doublets with large @xmath381 .",
    "unfortunately , as we have already seen , unless a single flavon multiplet is responsible for the elements of @xmath382 involving the light generations ( which will not be the case for @xmath267 ) , then we expect to get the operator @xmath383 forcing @xmath384 tev .",
    "thus , we instead use a single higgs but enlarge the flavor symmetry to include an extra @xmath385 factor under which only @xmath386 is charged .",
    "we introduce a bulk flavon @xmath281 , whose charge under this @xmath385 is opposite that of @xmath386 , and take the vev of @xmath281 on our wall to be @xmath387 .",
    "next we introduce another bulk flavon , @xmath16 , a doublet under @xmath255 .",
    "we can choose a basis in which its vev on our wall is @xmath388 with @xmath389 real , and to yield a reasonable @xmath390 we take @xmath391 .",
    "our picture for the symmetry breaking that gives masses to the light generations is designed to preserve certain features of the standard @xmath18 fermion mass texture , in particular the relation @xmath392 .",
    "we imagine that on a distant brane the subgroup @xmath393 is broken down to @xmath18 by a source that shines the bulk flavon @xmath93 , transforming as ( 2 , @xmath394 ) under this subgroup .",

    "what does this assortment of breakings say about the yukawa matrices ?",
    "the flavor symmetry allows us the freedom to choose convenient forms for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 vevs , but because of the primordial breaking on our brane , and because of the freedom already used to fix the form of @xmath16 , we are only allowed arbitrary @xmath399 transformations , where the @xmath400 acts on @xmath401 alone .",
    "these transformations allow us to take @xmath402 on our wall , with both @xmath262 and @xmath263 real .",
    "we are stuck with a phase in @xmath92 ; this is the origin of cp violation in the model .",
    "the leading order couplings of these flavons to the quarks are @xmath403 so that at this stage the yukawa textures are @xmath404    to give masses to the charm and strange quarks , we assume the presence of two additional bulk fields , @xmath405 , that transform as @xmath406 under @xmath407 and @xmath396 for this purpose , because the relation @xmath408 would be spoiled by the yukawa term @xmath409 .",
    "moreover , the bulk coupling @xmath410 would regenerate @xmath93 in the vicinity of our wall , and would also disrupt the texture ( we might expect , for instance @xmath411 ) . ] .",

    "note , however , that the orientation and phase of @xmath413 is determined entirely by the orientation and phase of @xmath16 and @xmath114 , so that we have @xmath414 where @xmath415 and @xmath416 are both real .    including the leading order coupling of all flavons to the quarks",

    "the issue of the neutron edm is more subtle . despite the fact that cp is broken spontaneously",
    ", one might expect this model to have an edm problem because the mass and edm matrices are produced by several flavons , rather than by a single multiplet as in @xmath0 .",
    "however , an attractive feature of this model is that , in the mass basis , the phase @xmath428 appears only in the ckm matrix and _ not _ in the leading order edm matrices .",
    "this is clear from ( [ eq : finaltex ] ) : rotating @xmath429 makes the mass and edm matrices completely real , because the 1 - 2 entry of the up quark edm matrix started out with precisely the same phase as @xmath430 .",
    "higher order contributions to these matrices disrupt this cancellation .",
    "we find that the order of magnitude of the contribution to the neutron edm is determined by the coupling @xmath431 setting @xmath432 gives 1 - 1 entries in both the down quark edm and mass matrices of roughly @xmath433 in the flavor basis . in the mass basis",
    ", the 1 - 1 element of edm matrix has approximate size @xmath434 , so the phase of that element will be roughly @xmath435 , suggesting that the bound on @xmath6 is reduced to well below 1 tev .",
    "we find the picture for generating flavor of sections 4 and 5 , based on the maximal @xmath0 flavor group and involving only three identical flavor - breaking branes with triplet sources pointing in random directions , to be both elegant and plausible .",
    "nevertheless , it does not provide a _ predictive _ theory of flavor .",
    "furthermore , there is no explanation of the @xmath436 hierarchy .",
    "there are two points that need to be addressed in order to build more predictive theories based on @xmath0 : 0.15 in @xmath437the brane geometry must be more constrained .",
    "0.08 in @xmath437the directions in @xmath0 space shone by the triplets must be more constrained .",
    "0.15 in in this section , we will present some examples of more predictive theories along these lines . in order to deal with the second point",
    ", we will assume that the dynamics on the branes is such that the triplet sources have identical strengths and can only shine in three orthogonal directions , which we take to be @xmath438 , and @xmath439 .",
    "if we continue to work with just three parallel source branes , as in the previous sections , we would be stuck with @xmath440 .",
    "therefore we consider other brane configurations .",
    "in particular , we imagine that the triplets @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath441 are all localized on different defects , which we label as @xmath442 , @xmath443 , and @xmath444 branes .",
    "we take all the @xmath444 branes to be parallel and equally spaced , and similarly for the @xmath442 and @xmath443 branes . however , the @xmath444 branes intersect at right angles with both the @xmath442 and @xmath443 branes , and at the junctions @xmath92 and @xmath93 have sources .",
    "the yukawa matrices are thus shined from the points of intersection on a grid of flavor breaking branes .",
    "we will describe three simple and predictive grid models . in the first",

    "until we have a theory that determines the inter - brane separations , we ca nt justify the regularity of the grid , however the symmetry of the system ensures that the configuration is at least a local extremum of the potential . in an attempt to understand why @xmath448 , we imagine that our three - brane is located at one of the @xmath444 - @xmath442 intersections , but is not in contact with a @xmath443 brane",
    ". below we will find it necessary to make the offset , the shortest distance from our three - brane to the nearest @xmath444 - @xmath443 intersection , much smaller than the brane spacing .",

    "we have placed our universe near a corner of the grid , where it is easiest to attain hierarchical quark masses for all three generations .",
    "we stress that the starting point for this theory is a remarkably symmetrical configuration of source branes . in the absence of our 3 brane , and of spontaneous breakings ,",
    "the configuration is completely symmetrical with respect to interchanging any pair of the extra dimensions 1,2 and 3 .",
    "the labels @xmath449 are just labels of identical sets of branes .",
    "the lack of symmetry only occurs by virtue of the position of our own 3 brane and the gauging on it .",
    "flavor symmetry is built into the large scale structure of the bulk , and is explicitly broken only at a point defect .",
    "already we can see that the resulting mass matrices will have an interesting structure .",
    "for instance , keeping only the exponential dependence of the @xmath114 propagators , the up mass matrix has the form @xmath450 where @xmath451 exp @xmath452 is the suppression factor with @xmath331 the interbrane spacing .",
    "this sort of pattern is not expected in 4d theories of flavor , where usually only integer powers of a small parameters appear .",
    "we now proceed to a quantitative analysis .",
    "as mentioned above , we take the magnitudes of each source vev to be precisely the same , and allow the triplets to point in three orthogonal directions .",
    "we can choose a basis where the triplets on the @xmath444 , @xmath443,and @xmath442 branes nearest us all point in the 3 direction ; for conciseness we label these branes as @xmath453 , @xmath454 , and @xmath455 .",
    "the @xmath455 - @xmath453 intersection shines the yukawa coupling @xmath456 where @xmath457 absorbs the source strengths and their couplings to the bulk flavons ( we take these to be the same for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , and @xmath458 is the distance from our brane to the @xmath455-@xmath459 intersection .",
    "note that if there are @xmath460 extra dimensions , the propagator is given by equation ( [ eq : chivev ] ) with @xmath461 , because the shining is from the 4d intersection of two five - branes .",
    "meanwhile , from the @xmath454-@xmath453 intersection we get the yukawa coupling @xmath462 where the second term comes from the direct coupling of the triplet sources to standard model fields , and the propagator has been cutoff at a distance @xmath463 .",
    "of course , with @xmath464 , @xmath457 , @xmath465 , and the offset @xmath458 , we have more than enough freedom to fit the top and bottom quark masses ; the hope is that these four free parameters plus the brane spacing @xmath331 can be simultaneously chosen to give reasonable ckm mixing angles and mass ratios for the other quarks as well .",
    "an additional hope is that the parameter values for a successful fit not be too far from unity . in this case , the smallness of @xmath292 is not put in by hand by simply choosing @xmath466 , but is instead a consequence of our location at a @xmath442-@xmath444 intersecion , away from @xmath443 branes .",
    "note that even in the limit that we are very near a @xmath467 interesection , @xmath468 is still suppressed by a factor if @xmath469 .",
    "the model we have described is quite constrained .",
    "for a given configuration of triplet vevs , the quantities @xmath470 and @xmath471 specify all ratios of yukawa matrix elements except those involving @xmath472 ; by further fixing @xmath473 , where @xmath460 is the number of extra dimensions , we determine the magnitudes of all yukawa matrix elements except @xmath472 , which is given only once we choose @xmath474 .",

    "of course , this problem can be avoided if we introduce an additional free parameter , for instance by letting @xmath92 and @xmath93 have different masses , by allowing the spacing between the @xmath442 and @xmath443 branes to be different , or by giving @xmath92 and @xmath93 different couplings to the triplet sources .",
    "however , even if adjustments like these are made to accomodate @xmath482 , we find that it is not possible to simultaneously obtain accurate predictions for all other mass ratios and mixing angles .",
    "a simple modification of the brane grid just described is to eliminate the @xmath442 branes and place the @xmath288 sources on the same branes as the @xmath441 s . to make the picture more symmetric",
    ", we could imagine that on the @xmath443 branes we have additional triplet sources @xmath485 that transform under yet another @xmath22 , under which all standard model fields are singlets .",

    "two other important differences distinguish this grid from the previous one : first , there are now only three independent sources that shine @xmath92 ; second , the classical profiles for @xmath92 and @xmath93 shining are no longer identical - if the source branes are co - dimension @xmath487 objects , then the @xmath92 profile is determined using equation ( [ eq : chivev ] ) with @xmath488 , while for the @xmath93 profile one should use @xmath489 ( as the intersections of @xmath443 and @xmath444 branes have co - dimension @xmath490 ) .",
    "one fortunate effect of the latter difference is to increase @xmath482 from what the previous grid gave , for given choices of @xmath470 , @xmath331 , and @xmath465 .    to determine how well this grid can fit quark masses and mixings",
    ", we need to specify a vev configuration .",
    "for all six quarks to acquire mass , there must not be repetitions of vev orientations ( for example , we need one each of @xmath455 , @xmath477 , and @xmath491 ) . unfortunately , giving a 3 - 2 - 1 pattern to all three sets of triplet vevs leads automatically to an up quark mass that is too large compared to @xmath492 . in light of this we choose _ not _ to make the vevs on the most distant @xmath486 brane ( @xmath493 ) , but instead choose them to be ( @xmath494 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "superpartners can be in the loop and the dynamics of many strongly interacting supersymmetric theories are understood  at the end of the day one is tempted to say that supersymmetry did not allow much progress in understanding flavor . in fact , for supersymmetric theories the question has been how to avoid taking a step in the wrong direction : there are severe constraints from flavor - changing and cp violating processes on the form of the soft supersymmetry breaking interactions involving squarks and sleptons . while the answer motivated some flavor groups , it may be that these constraints are telling us more about how supersymmetry is broken than about how flavor is broken .",
    "in contrast , if we live on a three brane at some location in the bulk , with the fundamental scale from our viewpoint of order a tev , then the constraints on theories of flavor are radically altered , and a whole new world of flavor models is opened up . at first sight",
    "it again appears that we are heading in the wrong direction : how could disastrous flavor changing effects be avoided from operators generated at such a low scale , from familons and from light flavon exchange ?",
    "we have argued that all three objections are immediately removed by having a discrete non - abelian flavor group spontaneously broken on source branes in the bulk .",
    "the fundamental scale of flavor breaking on these source branes is order unity , but the breaking effects on our 3-brane are small because the source branes are distant from us .",
    "the origin of the flavor parameters is now a convolution of two effects : the geometrical configuration of the source branes in the bulk and our location relative to them , and the random relative orientations of the flavor breaking vevs on the various source branes .",
    "phenomenology places some constraints on these effects , and energetics suggest that the brane configuration will be highly symmetrical .",
    "we find that the convolution of these two effects has sufficient complexity to lead to the collection of mystifying flavor numbers nature has given us , while still originating from a very simple and elegant symmetrical structure .",
    "an interesting aspect of this picture is that flavor symmetry is a crucial feature of the extra dimensions and is important in determining the brane configurations in the bulk .",
    "on the other hand , our gauge interactions are restricted to our 3-brane , and are unimportant from the viewpoint of the bulk .",
    "it is important to stress that these theories really are new , and can not be mimicked by 4 dimensional theories .",
    "for example , the relative size of entries in the yukawa matrices are governed by distances to sources from which flavor breaking is shone .",
    "these relative distances involve factors , such as @xmath520 and @xmath521 as shown in eqn .",
    "[ [ eq : rt2 ] ] , which are characteristic of the spatial geometry .",
    "furthermore , these theories of flavor can occur whether the extra dimensions are large , small or infinite , and whether the background geometry is flat or curved .",
    "in addition , there are new ideas for a qualitative explanation of features of the fermion mass spectrum . in grid theories",
    "a fermion mass hierarchy is _ inevitable _  our 3-brane must be located closer to some source branes than to others .",
    "the uniquely heavy top quark is explained by having our 3-brane located on source branes which break flavor symmetry in the up sector .",
    "the origin of @xmath522 may be a brane configuration such as the one shown in figure 8 , where our 3-brane lies equidistant between two source branes for breaking flavor in the down sector .    as well as",
    "a new structure for flavor , and new ideas for qualitative features of the fermion mass spectrum , theories in extra dimension offer a completely new mechanism for obtaining precise flavor parameter predictions .",
    "it is striking that there have been only a few theoretical ideas which lead to relations amongst the flavor observables , such as @xmath392 and @xmath523 .",
    "texture zeros , symmetry properties of the yukawa matrices , and grand unified relations between up , down and lepton sectors have been the most important tools .",
    "extra dimensions offer a completely new possibility : the yukawa matrices on our 3-brane at @xmath126 are given by @xmath524 where @xmath525 is the location of source @xmath8 which shines the flavor breaking @xmath526 via the propagator @xmath527 .",
    "the positions @xmath525 depend only on the lattice spacing , and there may be few possible spontaneous choices for the orientation of @xmath526 .",
    "this basic idea can be implemented in a wide range of models .",
    "there are clearly very many source brane structures to be considered , even concentrating on those with high symmetry , and one may question whether such constructions are plausible origins for the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "we find little reason to prefer the alternative picture of multiple frogatt - nielsen fields and flavons with masses enormously high compared to the tev scale .",
    "rather than debate the relative merits , it seems worth exploring this new class of theories in which there is a spatial geometry of flavor .",
    "we would like to thank s. dimopoulos for useful discussions .",
