    "though the irregular behaviour of the luminous matter distribution is even more pronounced in perseus - pisces than in lsc the mass estimates were reasonable .",

    "this result is in agreement with paper i , where the difference was suspected to mean that the virial mass is estimated from a more concentrated volume .",
    "another plausible explanation is that virgo is flattened . when presuming spherical symmetry under such condition more mass is required to induce the same effect on the velocities .",
    "we were also able to find a solution predicting exactly one virial mass .",
    "though this model does not agree with observations as well as model 1 the fit is  considering the large uncertainties involved  acceptable .",
    "we find these results significant in three ways .",
    "the intrinsic behaviour of the sample outside virgo does not disagree with the global value of the hubble constant @xmath4 .",
    "the tb - solutions agree with @xmath78 , a value in excellent concordance with @xmath70 given by federspiel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting also to be able to predict exactly one virgo virial mass in the einstein - desitter universe , because in paper i the mass predictions were larger than one and because @xmath103 is strongly supported by theoretical considerations ( both inflation and grand unification require this value ) .",
    "discussion on the cosmological constant @xmath104 is postponed to a later phase of our research programme .",
