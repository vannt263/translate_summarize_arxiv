    "the unexpectedly large branching fraction of order @xmath6 for the inclusive production of high - momentum @xmath2 mesons in @xmath0 decays first reported by the cleo collaboration in 1997 @xcite has triggered some theoretical activity aiming at explaining the dynamical origin of this enhancement .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath2 meson as compared to other pseudoscalar mesons is one of the clearest manifestations of the axial anomaly in qcd .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the anomaly affects the production process of @xmath2 mesons @xcite .",
    "other possible enhancement mechanisms ( not mentioning those that invoke new fundamental interactions ) include a large @xmath7 content of the @xmath2 @xcite . given the theoretical uncertainties involved in the calculation of semi - inclusive branching fractions , the dynamical details remain unclear except that there appears to be no fundamental problem to account for the observed branching fraction .",
    "recent data on two - body final states containing @xmath2 ( summarized in table  [ tab : data ] ) show that the branching fraction for @xmath8 decay is about six times larger than that for the corresponding @xmath9 decay , confirming the semi - inclusive enhancement .",
    "the comparison with other two - body final states allows us to extract a more detailed pattern .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 is replaced by @xmath1 the corresponding branching fraction is suppressed rather than enhanced compared to the @xmath10 mode .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement and suppression appears to be absent or even reversed when the pseudoscalar kaon is replaced by the corresponding vector meson , and with the current limited data no particularly striking pattern is visible when the kaons are replaced by pions or @xmath11 mesons .",
    "the theoretical description of exclusive two - body decays has also improved , since the concept of factorization is now better understood @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization approach , in particular , has successfully explained the magnitude of tree and penguin amplitudes of final states with pions and kaons @xcite , while the calculation of strong interaction phases remains to be validated by experiments .",
    "it is therefore clearly interesting to see whether this approach can explain the pattern of branching fractions containing @xmath12 mesons as described above .",
    "the new element that has to be understood for this purpose is a flavor - singlet amplitude , defined as the amplitude for producing a quark ",
    "antiquark pair not containing the spectator quark in the coherent flavor state @xmath13 or a pair of gluons , where the quarks or gluons have small relative transverse momentum and hadronize into an @xmath12 meson .",
    "the analysis of this singlet amplitude , which has not been considered systematically in the qcd factorization approach so far , is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "we will indeed see below that the standard qcd factorization formula does not hold , but that a suitable modification allows us to obtain the flavor - singlet amplitude at leading order in an expansion in @xmath14 at the price of introducing one new non - perturbative parameter .",
    "we shall find that the qcd factorization approach can qualitatively account for the pattern of exclusive branching fractions described above , including the large rate for the @xmath15 final state , but the theoretical uncertainties are rather large .",
    "in particular , we find that it is the constructive or destructive interference of non - singlet penguin amplitudes rather than an enhanced singlet penguin amplitude which is responsible for the distinctive pattern of strangeness - changing transitions to @xmath12 mesons , much along the lines envisaged qualitatively by lipkin @xcite",
    ". the improved description of data compared to the naive factorization analysis @xcite comes from the radiative enhancement of the non - singlet penguin amplitude , which also underlies the sizeable branching fractions for @xmath16 final states .",
    "our findings are in contrast to other recent analyses of the @xmath12 modes @xcite , where the large branching fractions for the @xmath17 final states were attributed due to an enhanced flavor - singlet penguin amplitude .",
    "similarly , the singlet amplitudes we obtain are smaller than those inferred from phenomenological analyses using su(3 ) symmetry and certain dynamical assumptions about flavor topologies @xcite .",
    "for completeness we note that the decays @xmath18 have also been analyzed using the perturbative qcd approach @xcite , however no singlet - specific mechanisms besides @xmath1@xmath2 mixing were investigated in this study .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some of the dominant theoretical uncertainties affecting our predictions cancel in ratios of branching fractions .",
    "the most interesting ratios are collected in table  [ tab : ratios ] and compared with the experimental data . for these predictions",
    "we perform a complete error analysis , quoting ( in this order ) the uncertainties due to input parameter variations ( other than @xmath19 ) , weak annihilation , the strange - quark mass , and ckm parameters .",
    "we find that the ratios are much less sensitive to weak annihilation and the uncertainty in the strange - quark mass than the individual branching fractions , facilitating the comparison with experiment . in some cases there are , however , still sizeable uncertainties due to other input parameter variations , especially those of the heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "a more detailed verification of the underlying mechanism of penguin interference will become possible once the branching fractions for which currently only upper limits exist have been measured .",
    "we note that we have also computed the corresponding branching fractions for @xmath20 decays , in which the final state contains a pion instead of a kaon and a @xmath11 meson instead of @xmath21 .",
    "we find that these decays are tree - dominated . as a consequence the cancellations among penguin amplitudes are of lesser importance for the overall branching fractions , and no drastic signatures as in the case of strangeness - changing decays emerge .",
    "motivated by the observation of the large branching fractions for the decays @xmath22 and the distinctive pattern of other decay modes with @xmath1 or @xmath2 mesons in the final state , we have computed the flavor - singlet decay amplitude in rare hadronic @xmath0 decays using the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "we have considered three effects that are specific to singlet mesons due to their gluon content , and which occur at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion : the @xmath23 amplitude , equivalent at leading order to an `` intrinsic charm '' decay constant ; spectator scattering involving two gluons ; and weak annihilation , where the leading - power contribution can be interpreted as a gluon contribution to the @xmath24 form factors , and the remainder can be estimated in terms of the leading - twist two - gluon light - cone distribution amplitude of the @xmath12 .",
    "a conceptually new result is that the spectator scattering is soft at leading order in the heavy - quark expansion , and hence appears to break factorization .",
    "nevertheless , the long - distance contributions can be parameterized by a non - local @xmath25 form factor , which is insensitive to the details of the singlet - meson wave function . in this sense factorization still holds ; however , the factorization formula has to be amended for singlet - meson final states by an additional term involving this non - local form factor .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the flavor - singlet decay amplitude is not a key factor in explaining the pattern of the observed branching fractions , at least if the parameters that enter this amplitude ( such as the non - local form factor mentioned above ) do not exceed substantially our estimates . rather we find ( as has been suggested qualitatively in @xcite ) that the constructive or destructive interference of penguin amplitudes , where either the @xmath26 meson or the @xmath12 meson picks up the spectator quark , is responsible for this pattern .",
    "the structure of these cancellations is visible already in the naive factorization approach @xcite . the important improvement from qcd factorization comes from the possibility to compute radiative corrections to the penguin amplitude , which turn out to be large enough to bring the predicted branching fractions into reasonable agreement with the data , at least for certain choices of the input parameters .",
    "the hadronic parameter uncertainties remain however large .",
    "we may therefore conclude that while it appears unlikely that one can obtain an accurate description of final states with singlet mesons from first principles , the results of our analysis clearly support the relevance of factorization to this class of charmless hadronic decays .",
