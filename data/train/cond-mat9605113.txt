    "recent progress in nanolithographic technology revived the interest to both experimental and theoretical investigation of electron transport in various mesoscopic proximity systems consisting of superconducting and normal metallic layers .",
    "in such systems the cooper pair wave function of a superconductor penetrates into a normal metal at a distance which increases with decreasing temperature @xcite . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "this distance becomes large and the whole normal metal may acquire superconducting properties .",
    "although this phenomenon has been already understood more than thirty years ago and intensively investigated during past decades , recently novel physical features of metallic proximity systems have been discovered @xcite and studied theoretically ( see @xcite and further references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the influence of the proximity effect on transport properties of a diffusive conductor in the limit of relatively low temperatures and voltages .",
    "we will assume that this conductor is brought in a direct contact to a superconducting reservoir which serves as an effective injector of cooper pairs into a normal metal",
    ". we will show that if the system contains no tunnel barriers there are two different physical regimes which determine the system conductance in different temperature intervals .",
    "it is well known that proximity induced superconducting correlation between electrons in a diffusive normal metal survives at a distance of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient . as @xmath6",
    "is lowered the proximity induced superconductivity expands into the normal metal and , consequently , the `` normally conducting '' part of the system effectively shrinks in size .",
    "this effect results in increasing of the conductance of a normal metal . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "the length @xmath7 becomes of order of the size of the normal layer and the system behavior becomes sensitive to a physical choice of the boundary condition at the edge of the normal wire opposite to that attached to a superconductor .",
    "one possible choice of this boundary condition corresponds to the assumption that a nontransparent barrier is present at the edge of this wire .",
    "then electrons can not diffuse out of the wire , the proximity induced superconducting correlation survives everywhere in the system and a real gap in the quasiparticle spectrum develops in the n - metal @xcite .",
    "the value of this gap is of order of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the bulk superconducting gap and @xmath10 is the length of the normal wire .",
    "another possible situation corresponds to the presence of a big normal reservoir n directly attached to the n - wire by means of a highly transparent contact . in this case",
    "even at very low @xmath6 the proximity induced cooper pair amplitude is essentially nonhomogeneous in the n - metal .",
    "indeed , close to a superconductor this amplitude is large , whereas in the vicinity of a normal reservoir it is essentially suppressed .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the whole n - wire can not be characterized by the real gap in its quasiparticle spectrum . in the absense of a potential barrier between n and n",
    "this gap is obviously equal to zero at the nn interface and  as will be demonstrated  everywhere in the normal metal .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the density of states in the n - metal shows a soft pseudogap which is again of the order of @xmath11 . in other words , the spacially averaged normalized density of states @xmath12 in the n - wire at small",
    "@xmath13 is smaller than its normal state value @xmath14 but always remains nonzero .",
    "it increases with increasing @xmath15 and reaches the value @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "this is the key point for understanding the low temperature behavior of the conductance of our system .",
    "as the temperature increases from zero , higher and higher values of @xmath15 contribute to the current and the system conductance  due to the increase of @xmath18 with @xmath15  increases with @xmath6 .",
    "this regime takes place until the temperature reaches the value @xmath19 where the crossover to a high temperature behavior takes place .",
    "note that similar behavior of the normal metal conductance in the presence of proximity - induced superconductivity has been recently found by nazarov and stoof @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the system without tunnel barriers is that at @xmath2 its conductance @xmath20 coincides with that of a normal metal with no proximity effects .",
    "this result has been first obtained by artemenko , volkov and zaitsev @xcite for the case of a normal - superconducting constriction .",
    "although it is already around for many years the physical meaning of this result  if any  still needs to be understood . at the first sight the linear conductance of the system at @xmath2 should be smaller than in the normal state because of the presence of the ( pseudo)gap in the normal dos @xmath18 at low energies .",
    "why is this not the case ?    in order to answer this question we should recall the well known fact that in the presence of nonequilibrium effects the current flowing in a superconductor depends not only on the normal dos but is characterized by a set of generalized dos @xcite .",
    "our problem is just a particular example of a nonequilibrium superconductor : on one hand superconducting correlation penetrates into the normal metal and the cooper pair amplitude is nonzero there , on the other hand in the absence of low transparent tunnel barriers the electric field also penetrates into the n - metal and drives the quasiparticle distribution function out of equilibrium .",
    "we will argue that in this situation one of the generalized dos ( below we define it as @xmath21 )  that is nonzero in the n - layer due to the presence of proximity induced superconducting correlation at low energies  plays an important role and also contributes to the system conductance .",
    "in other words , in the presence of the electric field inside the system _ both uncorrelated and correlated electrons contribute to a dissipative current_. this is the reason why in the presence of proximity induced superconductivity the system conductance is never smaller than its normal state value although the normal dos @xmath22 at low energies @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the situation is entirely different in the presence of low transparent tunnel barriers .",
    "provided their resistances are much larger than that of the n - metal the whole voltage drop takes place at these barriers and the electric field does not penetrate into the n - layer . in this case only uncorrelated electrons contribute to the dissipative current and therefore only the normal dos @xmath18 matters .",
    "as a result the temperature dependence of the system conductance changes . we will demonstrate that with lowering the barrier transparency the crossover takes place to the effective conductance decreasing monotonously with t , characteristic for two serial nis tunnel junctions ( s is now the diffusive normal conductor with the proximity - induced gap ) .",
    "note that both types of the behavior , namely reentrant and monotonously decreasing with @xmath6 conductance have been observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that both densities of states @xmath12 and @xmath21 can be investigated in one experiment .",
    "we will come back to this point further below .",
    "when the system contains a mesoscopic loop of a normal metal , the conductance as a function of the magnetic flux through the loop shows oscillations with the period @xmath0 ( superconducting flux quantum ) .",
    "although the cooper pair amplitude ( and thus the supercurrent ) in the ring is exponentially small at @xmath23 , the amplitude of these oscillations decays only as @xmath24 .",
    "this again illustrates an important difference in the behavior of kinetic ( conductance ) and thermodynamic ( supercurrent ) quantities . below we will argue that in the systems considered here even at large @xmath25 the behavior of the first quantity is dominated by correlated low energy electrons with @xmath26 penetrating far into the normal metal whereas the contribution of electrons with @xmath27 to the second one is only important .",
    "again the presence of the electric field inside the n - metal is crucially important for this effect . at low @xmath6 the oscillation amplitude",
    "again shows the reentrant behavior and vanishes in the limit @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "a clear experimental evidence for a @xmath3 decay of the conductance oscillations has been recently reported in ref . .",
    "finally we point out that making use of the the geometry with a metallic loop one can easily tune the densities of states of the system by applying a magnetic flux @xmath1 inside this loop .",
    "we will show that e.g. for @xmath30 the proximity effect in the normal region `` after '' the loop is completely suppressed and the normal dos @xmath31 there .",
    "this effect can be investigated experimentally and used for further studies of proximity induced superconductivity in normal metullic structures .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the general kinetic approach based on quasiclassical green functions in the keldysh technique and define the physical quantities of interest .",
    "then a detailed analysis of this quantities ( conductance  section iii , dos  section iv , elecric field  section v ) will be presented .",
    "sections vi and vii are devoted to the extension of our analysis to the proximity systems containing mesoscopic normal metal loops with a magnetic flux .",
    "the main results of the present paper are summarized in section viii .",
    "further details related to different geometric realizations of the proximity systems with loops are presented in appendix .",
    "let us consider a quasi - one - dimensional normal conductor of a length @xmath32 with a superconducting strip of a thickness @xmath33 attached to a normal metal on the top of it and two normal reservoirs attached to its edges ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the length @xmath10 is assumed to be much larger than the elastic mean free path @xmath34 but much shorter than the inelastic one .",
    "this geometrical realization has a direct relation to that investigated in the experiments @xcite .",
    "two big normal reservoirs n are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at the potentials @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "in contrast to the case of a ballistic constriction @xcite the potential drop within the system is distributed between the interfaces and the conductor itself . the general approach to calculate the conductance of these structures was developed in @xcite . in what follows we shall apply this method to analyse the temperature dependence of the ns proximity structure of fig .",
    "[ nns ] .",
    "such an experimental realization allows to prepare a structure without effective tunnel barriers in the direction of the current flow .",
    "even with `` perfect '' samples in a usual sandwich geometry , a natural barrier shows up due to the inevitable mismatch of fermi velocities between different materials .",
    "this could well be one of the reasons why in the previous experiments with sandwich - like structures , the reentrant behavior of the conductance was not detected @xcite .",
    "the electron transport through the metallic system can be described by the equations for a matrix of quasiclassical green functions @xmath37 in the contact @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the impurity - averaged advanced , retarded and keldysh green functions .",
    "these functions are in turn matrices in the nambu space : @xmath42 here the distribution function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45describes deviation from equilibrium . taking advantage of the normalization condition for the normal and the anomalous green functions @xmath46 it is convenient to parametrize @xmath47 @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a complex function .",
    "deep in the bulk superconductor it is equal to @xmath50 -i\\pi /2 $ ] for @xmath51 and @xmath52 /2 $ ] for @xmath53 ( here and below we omit the indices r(a ) ) .",

    "here we neglected the processes of inelastic relaxation and put the pair potential in the normal metal equal to zero @xmath67 assuming the absence of electron - electron interaction there .",
    "before we come to a detailed solution of the problem let us point out that the conclusion about the anomalous behavior of the system conductance can be reached already from the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "indeed it is quite clear from ( [ eq2 ] ) that the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath68 increases in the n - regions with proximity - induced superconductivity and , therefore , the electric field is partially expelled from these regions .",
    "this energy dependent field modulation is controlled by the solution for @xmath69 and is directly related to the physical origin of the anomalous temperature dependence of the system conductance discussed below .",
    "the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) should be supplemented by the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the normal metal n. assuming that the anomalous green function of big normal reservoirs n is equal to zero from @xcite we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the interface resistance parameter , @xmath72 is the specific resistance of the interface between the n - conductor and the n-reservoirs , @xmath73 is the resistivity of the n - metal , and @xmath74 is the temperature independent characteristic length scale in n ( note that the coherence length in n @xmath75 is t - dependent ) .    in general we should also fix the boundary condition at the interface between the n - metal and the superconductor . for the case of a perfect transparency of this interface and for typical thickness of the normal layer @xmath76 , cooper pairs easily penetrate into it due to the proximity effect and the green functions of the n - metal at relatively low energies for @xmath77 are equal to those of a bulk superconductor @xmath78 ( the influence of finite transparency of the ns - contact will be discussed below ) . in this sence",
    "the region of a normal metal situated directly under the superconductor can be also treated as a piece of a superconductor s and the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) needs to be found only for @xmath79 ( without loss of generality we will stick to a symmetric configuration ) .",
    "cooper pairs penetrate into the normal conductor also in the case of a not perfectly transparent ns interface .",
    "as it is demonstrated below , the energy gap is induced in s region in this case . as a result , for a sufficiently long n - wire , which is only considered here , the presence of the barrier at the ns interface will not influence the results derived for the system conductance .",
    "proceeding along the same lines as it has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite we arrive at the final expression for the current @xmath80 d(\\varepsilon ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath81 defines the effective transparency of the system @xcite    @xmath82    @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the resistance of the n - metal .",
    "let us consider the case of a sufficiently long normal conductor @xmath86 .",
    "then at low temperatures @xmath87 the interesting energy interval is restricted to @xmath88 . for such values of @xmath89",
    "the contribution of the @xmath90-part of the normal conductor shows no structure and can be easily taken into account with the aid of obvious relations @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( no barrier at the ns interface ) or @xmath93 ( the barrier is present at the ns interface ) . due to this reason we will discuss only the properties of the @xmath62-part ( @xmath79 ) . for the sake of completeness we will also demonstrate the effect of finite @xmath94 in the end of our calculation .    for the differential conductance of the @xmath62-part @xmath95 normalized to its normal ( `` non - proximity '' ) value in the zero bias limit eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) yields @xmath96 analogously the normalized zero - bias electrostatic potential distribution reads @xmath97    the normal density of states is given by the normal green s function via the standard relation @xmath98 which enters into the conductance in the form @xmath99 together with a correlation dos @xmath100 .",
    "the importance of the latter quantity for understanding the effects discussed here has been already pointed out in the introduction .",
    "we will discuss the features of these local densities as well as the averaged ones :    @xmath101    as it has been already mentioned the `` correlation dos '' @xmath102 belongs to the set of generalized densities of states familiar from the standard theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it reflects the presence of superconducting correlations at low energies .",
    "e.g. in a bcs superconductor this function reads @xmath103 . in our case",
    "this function is not only energy- but also space - dependent due to the fact that the proximity induced superconducting correlation decays inside the normal metal .",
    "but the physical meaning of it remains the same as in standard nonequilibrium superconductivity theory @xcite : @xmath102 plays a role whenever the quasiparticle distribution function of a superconductor is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "it happens e.g. in the well - known problems of charge relaxation @xcite and imbalance @xcite .",
    "it happens also here due to a simultaneous presence of the electric field and the proximity induced superconducting correlation in the normal metal .",
    "let us consider the effect of a tunnel barrier at the ns interface in more details .    under the assumption that the n - wire thickness is small @xmath104 the equation for @xmath105 in the region",
    "@xmath106 underneath the superconducting terminal can be derived by the method of ref .",

    "this equation is valid for @xmath114 i.e. for sufficiently small transparency of the ns interface : @xmath115 .    as follows from eq.([teta - b ] ) , superconducting properties of the n - layer are described in terms of the energy - dependent coherence length @xmath116 ^{1/2}\\right\\ } ^{1/2},\\ ] ] which determines an exponential decay of @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "the expression for @xmath119 has a pole at the gap energy @xmath120 , which signals the decay of quasiparticles entering n at @xmath121 .",
    "at high energy @xmath122 the well known result @xmath123 is reproduced , whereas at low energies @xmath124 one obtains @xmath125 .",
    "thus the effective length scale in n increases with the decrease of the sn interface transparency .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the gap energy @xmath126 assuming the `` rigid '' boundary conditions @xmath127 either from the pole of @xmath128 or , making use of the solution @xmath129 $ ] and calculating the quasiparticle density of states @xmath130 . subsituting the expression for @xmath131 into this solution one arrives the equation for the energy gap    @xmath132    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the general solution is rather cumbersome , therefore here we present only its asymptotic forms .",
    "the gap is given by @xmath135 for large transparency of the ns interface , @xmath136 , and by @xmath137 for small transparency , @xmath138 . in the latter case ( the mcmillan limit ) , the expression for the gap may be written as @xmath139 .",
    "the gap originates from the finite average lifetime @xmath140 for quasiparticles in the n layer with respect to andreev scattering from s , since a contribution of gapless quasiparticle trajectories parallel to the ns interface is eliminated in the diffusive regime .",
    "the dependence of @xmath126 on @xmath141 in the whole range of transparencies is presented in fig.[deltan ] . note that under a substitution @xmath142 the above expressions reproduce the result of ref.@xcite for a gap induced in a 2d electron gas in contact to a superconductor .",
    "we also note that in the case of two superconducting terminals attached to n the gap aquires a phase factor @xmath143 , @xmath144 being the phase difference between the terminals .    at the subgap energies",

    "the condition @xmath152 @xmath153 is satisfied , the presence of the barrier at the ns interface does not influence our results for the system conductance .",
    "the analysis of the problem can be significantly simplified in the case of perfectly transparent interfaces ( @xmath154 ) . in this case",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath155 for the contact to the normal and the superconducting reservoir respectively .",
    "the effective transparency of the n - part then reads @xmath156    as it was already pointed out for relatively long normal conductors and at low @xmath6 only the energies @xmath88 give an important contribution to the conductance . in this case",
    "the typical energy scale is defined by the thouless energy @xmath157 . for these energies we can set @xmath158 .",
    "let us first put @xmath2 .",
    "then the thermal distribution factor @xmath159 reduces to a delta function and we have @xmath160 i.e. we only need the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) at @xmath161 , which is @xmath162 .",
    "this does not depend on @xmath163 , so the correlations are destroyed by the influence of the boundary conditions but not by thermal excitation or by impurity scattering . from here , we can calculate the conductance @xmath164 i.e. at @xmath2 the system conductance exactly coincides with its normal state value ( cf .",
    "this result , however , by no means implies the destruction of the proximity induced superconductivity in the n - layer .",
    "later on , we will demonstrate , that the dos and the electrical field are completely different from their values in the normal state and in fact only due the additional contribution of correlated electrons the system conductance does not fall below its normal state value .    in the case",
    "@xmath165 we can calculate @xmath105 perturbatively . from @xmath166 and ( [ bc1 ] )",
    "we get @xmath167-i{\\frac \\pi 2}\\bar x.\\ ] ] keeping only leading order terms in @xmath168 , we get @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a universal constant .",
    "this means , that for low temperatures @xmath171 grows quadratically on the scale of @xmath172 and approaches the crossover towards the high temperature regime discussed below .    in the limit @xmath23 ( where we still have @xmath173 )",
    ", the contribution of the low energy components to the thermally weighted integral for @xmath174 is @xmath24 as we will see below and can therefore be neglected .",
    "we only have to take into account the solutions of ( [ eq1 ] ) for energies @xmath175 .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that for this energy range the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) together with ( [ bc1 ] ) reads @xmath176 where @xmath177 . by using obvious substitutions and multiple - argument relations for hyperbolic functions ,",
    "we arrive at the following identity : @xmath178 where @xmath179 .",
    "for calculating @xmath180 we can , as the integrand becomes exponentially small for @xmath181 , take the upper bound to infinity , such that it becomes a universal constant .",
    "from there we can calculate the conductance in this limit @xmath182 where again @xmath183 is a universal constant .",
    "these results has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "superconductivity penetrates into the normal part up to @xmath184 , whereas the rest stays normal , so the total voltage drops over a reduced distance @xmath185 .",
    "thus the resistance of the structure is reduced according to the ohm law . in terms of the conductance",
    ", this means @xmath186 which is equivalent to ( [ root ] ) .",
    "let us point out , that at both edges of the n - metal the local effective diffusion constant @xmath187 is not enhanced ( see fig .",
    "[ emm ] ) in comparison to its normal state value , because either the cooper pair amplitude ( at the nn boundary ) or the electric field ( at the ns boundary ) is equal to zero due to the imposed boundary conditions . inside the n - metal the value @xmath188 becomes higher due to nonequilibrium effects in the presence of superconducting correlations ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this effect is small at very low energies and becomes more pronounced at @xmath190 .    for temperatures comparable to @xmath191",
    "the problem was treated numerically .",
    "the results show an excellent agreement with our analytical expressions obtained in the corresponding limits .",
    "the numerical results ( see fig . [ conduc ] ) confirm , that for @xmath192 the universal scaling with @xmath193 is excellently fulfilled , the conductance peak with the height of about 9% takes place at @xmath194 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this peak becomes smaller if we take into account the influence of finite @xmath195 keeping @xmath196 fixed ( fig .",
    "[ eta ] ) the qualitative features , however , remain the same .",
    "let us now assume that a tunnel barrier is present at the n-n interface . if one lowers the transparency of this barrier the crossover takes place to the behavior demonstrating monotonously decreasing conductance with t ( fig .",
    "[ contunn ] ) , which is typical for two serial nis tunnel junctions .",
    "[ contunn ] demonstrates the crossover with increasing @xmath197 .",
    "inset shows the arrenius plot for the case of @xmath198 which illustrates the activated tunnel - like behavior .",
    "formally this is due to the term @xmath199 in the denominator of eq.([d(e ) ] ) , i.e. the contribution of the barrier at the n-n interface . in the small transparency limit @xmath200 the expression ( [ d(e ) ] )",
    "reduces to the standard tunnel formula .",
    "the physical reason for this behavior is transparent . for @xmath201",
    "the presence of a tunnel barrier is not important , the electric field penetrates inside the normal metal and we come back to the picture discussed above for perfectly transparent boundaries in which case both normal and correlation dos play a significant role .",
    "if , however , the resistance of a tunnel barrier dominates over the drude resistance of the normal metal @xmath202 , the whole voltage drop is concentrated at the barrier , nonequilibrium effects in the n - metal are absent and therefore only the normal density of states enters into the system conductance .",
    "an additional effect is that a real gap instead of a soft pseudogap develops in the case low transparent tunnel barriers .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes is discussed in more detail below .",
    "note that both types of behavior , namely nonmonotoneous and monotonously decreasing with t conductance have been observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "from our approximative solutions of the preceeding sections , the densities of states can be easily calculated .",
    "for @xmath203 we have @xmath204 . at low energies @xmath205 there are quadratic corrections : @xmath206 with @xmath207 and @xmath208 . for high energies , the densities approach their normal values , again with square - root corrections @xmath209 and @xmath210 with @xmath211 and @xmath212 .    together with our numerical data ( see fig .",
    "[ dos1 ] ) , this demonstrates the presence of a soft pseudogap in the density of states below the energy @xmath213 .",
    "similar results have also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the spatial dependence of the dos in the normal layer .",

    "the difference between these two cases is quite obvious : whereas for @xmath154 the normal dos at low energies is always finite , becoming larger at larger values of @xmath66 , for @xmath214 a real gap in the density of states clearly shows up at all energies .",
    "similar results have been recently discussed in refs .",
    "the overall behavior of the local correlation dos at each value of @xmath66 is similar to its average value .",
    "it is important to emphasize that both @xmath216 and @xmath217 are measurable quantities and can be directly probed in experiments .",
    "recently the spatial and energy dependence of the normal dos has been studied in tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "the data @xcite show a qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "the results obtained here suggest that much better agreement can be achieved if one takes into account smearing of the proximity induced gap in the normal metal due to the diffusion of normal electrons from the external circuit ( which plays the role of the n reservoir ) through the nn boundary . for nontransparent nn boundaries ( @xmath214 ) this process can be neglected and a real gap develops in the n - metal ( fig .",

    "the dependence of this effect on the size of the n - layer is depicted in fig .",

    "we would like to point out that a slow power - law decay of the conductance due to a dominating contribution of low energy quasiparticles just emphasizes the physical difference between kinetic and thermodynamic quantities , like supercurrent which decays exponentially with increasing @xmath6 .      as it was already discussed the simultaneous presence of correlated electrons and the electric field in the normal metal causes nontrivial nonequilibrium effects , the description of which involves two densities of states @xmath216 and @xmath217 . in the presence of the normal metal loop with the magnetic flux @xmath1 in our system there appeas a possibility to tune both normal and correlation dos by changing the value of @xmath1 .",

    "the normal and correlation dos for the point c ( fig . [ loop ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "we see that with increasing the value of the magnetic flux the proximity induced pseudogap decreases and vanishes completely as the flux approaches the value @xmath266 . for such value of @xmath1 the proximity effect in the region `` after '' the loop is completely destroyed , the pseudogap is fully suppressed and the normal dos coincides with @xmath267 at all energies . accordingly",
    "the correlation dos vanishes at @xmath268 .",
    "thus in this case the resistance of the region between the points c and d is equal to its normal state value at all @xmath6 .",
    "these results demonstrate that `` the strength '' of the proximity effect in our system can be regulated by the external magnetic flux .",
    "this might serve as an additional experimental tool for investigation of proximity induced superconductivity in normal metalic structures .",
    "in particular we believe that it would be interesting to repeat the tunneling experiments @xcite in the presence of the loop with the magnetic flux .",

    "we have used a microscopic kinetic analysis to describe the transport properties of superconductor - normal metal proximity structures . in the case of transparent inter - metallic boundaries we demonstrated a reentrant behavior of the system conductance with temperature .",
    "this behavior was attributed to nonequilibrium effects occuring in the normal metal in the presence of proximity induced superconductivity and the electric field .",
    "we argued that under these conditions both uncorrelated ( `` normal '' ) and correlated ( `` superconducting '' ) electrons contribute to the system conductance which is henceforth defined by a combination of two densities of states ",
    "the normal dos @xmath18 and the correlation dos @xmath227 . the latter is known to play an important role whenever the quasiparticle distribution function in a superconductor is driven out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we studied the energy dependence of both these quantities and demonstrated that if the normal metal is brought in a direct contact to a superconductor on one side and a big normal reservoir n on the other side the normal dos @xmath18 shows a soft pseudogap at energies below the thouless energy @xmath213 .",
    "this effect is due to an interplay between correlated and uncorrelated electrons penetrating into the n - layer respectively from a superconductor and a normal reservoir . if a low transparency tunnel barrier is present at the nn interface the diffusion of normal excitations into the n - metal is suppressed , the influence of a superconductor prevails and a real gap in the density of states develops",
    ".    low transparent tunnel barriers also prevent the electric field from penetration into the n - layer thus suppressing nonequilibrium effects there .",
    "we demonstrated that with the aid of a proper combination of the systems with and without tunnel barriers one can directly probe both energy and spacial dependencies of both densities of states @xmath18 and @xmath227 in one experiment .",
    "we extended our analysis to proximity systems containing the normal metal loop with the magnetic flux @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrated that the conductance of such systems as a function of @xmath1 oscillates with the period equal to the flux quantum @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations @xmath265 also shows the reentrant behavior being equal to zero at @xmath2 , increasing as @xmath29 at @xmath269 and decaying as @xmath3 at @xmath270 .",

    "we pointed out that the densities of states @xmath18 and @xmath227 can be tuned ( decreased ) by applying the magnetic flux @xmath1 . in particular , if the flux in the loop is equal to the half of the flux quantum @xmath272 the proximity effect in the region `` after '' the loop is completely suppressed , the normal dos @xmath16 at all energies and @xmath273 .",

    "as stated above , we proceed perturbatively from the case @xmath203 , @xmath277 first to finite flux , then to finite @xmath278 .",
    "as the usadel equation is quadratic in @xmath279 , the value @xmath280 does not distinguish between the upper and the lower branches of the ring ( 2 or 3 in fig .",

    "it is remarkable , that for @xmath289 due to ( [ bc ] ) we have @xmath290 at the point @xmath291 .",
    "therefore , the current conservation condition ( [ superc ] ) can be fulfilled for @xmath292 , @xmath293 ( different signs refer to different branches ) , so the phase gradient is zero almost everywhere and the usadel equation does not contain the phase any more .",

    "[ grkl ] ) .",
    "the key feature of fig . [ grkl ] ( b ) is the strong flux - dependence for systems with small rings .",
    "this fact can be also recovered from the usadel equation : for @xmath301 one estimates @xmath302 .",
    "as this enters quadratically and in the end we have to integrate over the ring only once , the contribution of the ring is roughly @xmath303 .      for the sake of simplicity above we have sticked to the case @xmath304 . as this condition",
    "might not be fulfilled in real experiments it is worthwhile to check whether the main features of our analysis survive for other values of @xmath305 . in order to do that we performed calculations also for the case @xmath306 .",
