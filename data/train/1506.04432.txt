    "although described by the same line element , the classical interior of the schwarzschild - tangherlini  @xcite black hole has entirely different properties than the region outside the event horizon and can be better understood as some sort of the anisotropic and nonstatic universe  @xcite . this interpretation ( not mandatory )",
    "is helpful when one is forced to abandon usual , i.e. , referring to the external world , interpretation of the coordinates , metric potentials and so on . in the @xmath0-dimensional case",
    "much work have been done in this direction and we have a good understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the classical interior ( see e.g. , refs .",

    "is known about quantum processes inside black holes and their influence upon the background geometry .    in the recent paper  @xcite we have studied influence of the quantized fields on the static spacetime of the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole using the semi - classical einstein field equations . since the stress - energy tensor constructed in that paper",
    "functionally depends on the metric , one has a rare opportunity to analyze and compare the quantum corrections to the black hole characteristics ( and the geometry itself ) calculated for various spacetime dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this paper , which is a natural continuation of refs .",
    "@xcite , is to extend the study of the quantized fields to the interiors of the higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "it should be noted however , that now there are problems that do not appear in the external region .",
    "the first one is the problem of the central singularity and its closest vicinity .",
    "it is evident that the semicalssical einstein field equations can not be trusted there .",
    "the second difficulty is to some extend related to the previous one and may be stated as follows .",
    "the effective action of the quantized fields for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the coordinate of the event horizon ) has been constructed for the positive - definite metric signature .",
    "once the stress - energy tensor is calculated it can be transformed to the physical spacetime by analytic continuation . in the exterior region",
    "it is the familiar wick rotation , which affects only the time coordinate . on the other hand ,",
    "inside the event horizon the problem is more complicated .",
    "the classical @xmath8dimensional solution describing interior of the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole with the event horizon located at @xmath9 is given by the line element @xmath10^{-1 } dt^{2 } +   \\left[\\left(\\frac{r_{+}}{t}\\right)^{d-3}-1\\right ] dx^2 +   t^{2 } d\\omega^{2}_{d-2 } ,      \\label{line_classical}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a metric on a unit @xmath12-dimensional sphere .",
    "since only in @xmath0 case there is a simple linear relation between the mass and @xmath7 in the present paper we use ( almost ) exclusively the latter .",
    "the radius of the event horizon of the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole characterized by the mass @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xmath16-dimensional newton constant and @xmath17 is the volume of the unit @xmath12-dimensional sphere .",

    "negative-_definite metric .",
    "having euclidean version of the geometry of the black hole interior on can construct the one - loop approximation to the effective action of the quantized massive fields in a large mass limit .",
    "indeed , for a sufficiently massive fields , i.e. , when the compton length , @xmath28 associated with the mass of the field , @xmath29 is much smaller than the characteristic radius of the curvature of the spacetime @xmath30 the contribution of the vacuum polarization to the effective action dominates and the contribution of real particles is negligible .",
    "one can therefore make use of the schwinger - dewitt asymptotic expansion that approximates the effective action @xmath31 this approach has been successfully applied in a number of interesting cases and the background spacetimes range from black holes  @xcite to cosmology  @xcite and from wormholes  @xcite to topologically nontrivial spacetimes  @xcite . for the purposes of the present paper , the most relevant are the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the approximate one - loop effective action @xmath32 of the quantized massive scalar field in a large mass limit can be constructed from the ( asymptotic ) schwinger - dewitt representation of the green function and in the lowest order it can be written in the following form : @xmath33}{(m^{2})^{k - d/2}}\\gamma\\left(k-\\frac{d}{2}\\right ) ,   \\label{wreg}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the floor function , i.e. , it gives the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath36 here @xmath37 $ ] is the coincidence limit of the @xmath38-th hadamard - dewitt coefficient constructed from the riemann tensor , its covariant derivatives up to @xmath39-order and contractions .",
    "for the technical details concerning construction of the hadamard - dewitt coefficients the reader is referred to refs .",
    "the ( regularized ) stress - energy tensor can be calculated from the standard definition @xmath40    there is one - to - one correspondence between the order of the wkb approximation and the order of the schwinger - dewitt expansion .",
    "for example , the sixth - order wkb approximation is equivalent to @xmath41 term in @xmath0 and to @xmath42 in @xmath4 whereas for the analogous results in @xmath2 and @xmath43 the eight - order wkb approximation is required .",
    "on general grounds one expects that the lowest - order ( nonvanishing ) term of the schwinger - dewitt expansion is the most important .",
    "the condition @xmath44 ( with the physical constants reinserted ) leads to @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath21 is given in seconds employed in the @xmath0-dimensional back reaction calculations reported in ref .",
    "for example , taking @xmath47 @xmath7 equal to the schwarzschild radius of the sun and @xmath48 kg one has @xmath49 which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the coordinate time of the event horizon .",
    "it follows than that in our calculations we can go fairly close to the central singularity .",
    "note that the coordinate time goes form @xmath50 to 0 . in the rest of the paper",
    "we use the geometric units and the adopted conventions are those of misner , thorne and wheeler  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec_back ] we study the semiclassical equations and analyze the influence of quantum perturbations on the black hole interior for @xmath51",
    "to gain a better understanding of the classical interior of the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole let us introduce the proper time @xmath52^{1/2 } }   \\label{tau_plus}\\ ] ] and , in the neighborhood of a point @xmath53 the locally euclidean coordinates @xmath54 near the singularity the schwarzschild - tangherlini metric can be approximated by the kasner metric @xmath55 where @xmath56 it can easily be checked that both kasner conditions are satisfied .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the other hand , near the event horizon the schwarzschild - tangherlini metric asymptotically approaches @xmath59 where @xmath60 once again it is the kasner metric with @xmath61 and vanishing remaining kasner exponents .",
    "finally observe , that the line element ( [ kasner2 ] ) can be formally obtained from the rindler solution @xmath62 by using the complex coordinate transformation .",
    "now , let us consider two points at the same coordinate instant separated by @xmath63 while the coordinate distance remains constant the physical distance between two points on the @xmath64 coordinate line is given by @xmath65^{1/2 } dx\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left[\\left(\\frac{r_{+}}{t}\\right)^{d-3}-1 \\right]^{1/2 } \\delta x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and grows as the coordinate time decreases .",
    "on the other hand , the proper distance between two points separated by @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 and it decreases as the coordinate time goes from @xmath7 to 0 .",
    "this behavior is independent of the dimension @xmath68    let us return to the proper time : it should be noted that taking a positive sign of the root of the equation @xmath69 as it has been done in eq .",
    "( [ tau_plus ] ) , the proper time monotonically grows with the coordinate time @xmath70 conversely , taking the negative root , the proper time increases as the coordinate time goes from @xmath7 to 0 .",
    "since the functional relations between @xmath71 and @xmath21 are not very illuminating we present them graphically ( fig i ) , demanding for both types of the universe @xmath72 as @xmath73 this can always be done by suitable choice of the integration constant .",
    "the universe inside the event horizon ( in both time scales ) has a finite lifetime . from the results collected in table",
    "i one sees that @xmath74 decreases with the dimension .     as a function of the coordinate time @xmath21 for @xmath75",
    "the upper branches are plotted for a negative root of ( [ proper_time ] ) whereas the lower ones for a positive root .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of the flow of the coordinate time .",
    "top to bottom ( for the upper branches ) the curves are plotted for @xmath76 , width=415 ]    .the lifetime of the interior universe . [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us analyze how the growth of the curvature are affected by the quantum processes . and",
    "since the classical part of the kretschmann scalar is positive , one concludes that the growth of curvature ( as @xmath21 decreases ) is weakened if the perturbation is negative .",
    "inspection of the figs .",
    "[ rys3 ] and [ rys4 ] as well as the table  [ tta3 ] shows that initially , regardless of the dimension , @xmath77 is always positive for the both types of couplings .",
    "this is very important message as it refers to the region where the quality of the approximation is expected to be high .",
    "a few words of comment are in order here .",
    "first , it should be emphasized once more that although we have plotted functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 for all allowable values of the coordinate time the approximation certainly does not work in the region close to the central singularity .",
    "therefore our results show the tendency in behavior of the quantum corrections as the central singularity is approached ( which can be misleading ) rather than their actual run .",
    "of course the answer to the question of how close the singularity can be approached depends on many factors , such as dimension , the ` radius ' of the event horizon and the type of the quantized field .",
    "each case should be analyzed separately .",
    "the second observation is less obvious and is , roughly speaking , related to the question of how long the first - order approximation dominates the higher - orders terms inside the event horizon .",
    "once again this problem goes to the very core of the schwinger - dewitt asymptotic expansion . and once again there is no better answer than to recall its principal assumptions . finally , let us observe that although the quantum corrections caused by a solitary field is expected to be small in the domain of applicability of the approximation , they can be made arbitrarily large for a large number of fields .",
