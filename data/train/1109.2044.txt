    "anyone who has ever taken part in group decision making or problem solving has most likely asked themselves at one point or another whether the process actually made any sense .",
    "would it not be better if the most competent person in the group simply made the decision ?",
    "in other words , it is an open question whether a group can ever outperform its most capable member .",
    "there have been many studies that have reported group decisions to be less accurate @xcite .",
    "some studies , however , have concluded that groups  even when they merely use simple majority voting  can make better decisions than their individual members @xcite .",
    "we ask a more general question : how does the group performance depend upon the individual performances of its participants and the ways in which those participants communicate ?",
    "this question is given new light by recent trends in cognitive psychology , which after a half a century of fascination with isolated cognition in the individual , has finally admitted the individual interaction with the social environment .",
    "it is increasingly understood that joint actions and joint cognition are not limited to situations of committee / voter decisions , but instead , they pervade everyday life and require the constant coordination and integration of cognitive and physical abilities .",
    "this new approach , typically called _ distributed cognition _",
    "@xcite , or _ extended cognition _ within the social domain @xcite , brings the focus of research to the mechanisms of cognitive and physical coordination @xcite that affect this integration .",
    "it also brings attention to the comparison of the performance of the group to the performance of the individual . for some tasks that require different types of knowledge and abilities from group participants , groups are likely to outperform individuals @xcite . for other tasks , such as simple discrimination tasks or estimations",
    ", a question arises if a group is indeed better than the best of its members .",
    "if there are such situations , it is important to know when they arise .",
    "group decision making obviously involves members interacting with each other . casting a vote",
    "requires a minimum amount of communication for the individual ( only to inform other group members about his or her choice ) .",
    "however , other group decisions allow for extensive communication and negotiations of the decision .",
    "our questions are : 1 ) which forms of communication are most likely to facilitate an improved outcome , and 2 ) what is actually being communicated in successful groups ? recent experiments by @xcite have shown that cooperation can be beneficial , even in simple task , and that this benefit is best explained by the participants communicating their relative confidences . in their study ,",
    "dyads ( pairs ) performed a perceptual two - choice discrimination task . on every trial participants had to decide which of two consecutive stimuli ( sets of gabor patches ) contained a patch with higher contrast .",
    "first , decisions were collected from both persons ; then , if the decisions were different , the participants were allowed to communicate to reach a joint decision .    the decision data obtained from each person was used to fit a psychometric function , i.e. , the probability of that person giving a specific answer , as a function of the difference of the contrast between gabor patches .",
    "these functions describe the person s skill in the task .",
    "similarly , a function describing the skill of the group as a whole can be estimated from the group decisions . as was described by bahrami : _ `` in experiments ( ... ) psychometric functions were constructed for each observer and for the dyad by plotting the proportion of trials in which the oddball was seen in the second interval against the contrast difference at the oddball location '' _",
    "( @xcite , supplementary materials , p. 3 ) .",
    "various assumptions about the nature of within - group interactions during the joint decision - making process can be made . from these assumptions",
    ", we can derive theoretical relationships between the parameters of members functions and the parameters of the group function .",
    "these are the models of decision making .",
    "the correctness of each joint decision model can then be tested against empirical data .",
    "@xcite described and evaluated four such models .",
    "one was own , in which group members communicate their confidence in their individual choices .",
    "another model stemmed from signal detection theory @xcite .",
    "if members know each other s relative discriminatory ability ( i.e. , their psychometric functions ) , the group can make a statistically optimal choice .",
    "thus , under certain conditions , we have an upper bound on group performance .",
    "the third model suggested that the dyad is only as good as its best member .",
    "finally , the last model tested was a control model involving random response selection .",
    "the study concluded that , when similarly skilled persons meet , they can both benefit from cooperation . a model in which participants communicate their relative confidences best explains this benefit .",
    "we extend the models from @xcite to groups of @xmath2 participants and compare their predictions .",
    "furthermore , we add a model in which a participant either knows the correct answer , or guesses .",
    "importantly , in the case of larger groups , it may be the case that only small subgroups of participants can communicate simultaneously .",
    "thus , we address this issue by considering hierarchical schemes of decision aggregation , in which decisions are first made by subgroups , and then some of these subgroups interact to reach a shared decision .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : discrimination ] , we present the @xcite approach to integrating individual discrimination functions in pairs of participants .",
    "we use it to assess performance in groups . in section [",
    "s : communication ] , we proceed to formulating a series of models of communication , which express the performance of a group of @xmath2 persons as a function of their individual performances . in section [ s : aggregation ] , we investigate how each model works , assuming several schemes of decision aggregation . section [ s : comparison ] compares the introduced models and provides insight into further experimental and theoretical work .",
    "section [ s : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "consider an experiment in which a participant has to make simple discriminatory decisions of varying difficulty .",
    "each trial is assigned a parameter , @xmath3 , that describes the physical distance between stimuli ( e.g. , in the bahrami et al .",
    "experiment @xmath3 was the difference in contrast between gabor patches ) .",
    "negative @xmath3 describes a situation in which the right choice is the first of the pair , whereas positive @xmath3 describes the opposite situation .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath3 reflects the difficulty of a given trial .",
    "the lower the value , the more difficult is the resulting trial .",
    "from now on , we refer to the parameter describing physical difference as _ stimulus c_. in the case of bahrami et al .",
    "experimental setup , it can be interpreted as the two - interval stimulus with the difference of contrasts equal to @xmath3 .    by knowing the choices of a certain decision - making agent ( in our case either a single participant or a group making the decision together ) for a range of stimuli",
    ", we can construct a mathematical description of the agent s performance on the task .    for each agent , we can then determine his or her psychometric function : the probability of the agent choosing the second answer as a function of the stimulus , @xmath4 .",
    "an ideal responder would be described by the heaviside step function : @xmath5 for all negative stimuli , and @xmath6 for all positive stimuli ( i.e. , choosing the second interval if and only if @xmath7 ) .    because responders make errors , the actual decision rule and probability are different .",
    "one way to describe such a response is derived from signal detection theory @xcite . according to it , for a stimulus @xmath3 ,",
    "a participant perceives stimulus @xmath8 , which is a normally distributed random variable centered around @xmath9 and with variance @xmath10 , and decides basing on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "two models described in this paper ( weighted confidence sharing and direct signal sharing ) use this mechanism explicitly .",
    "the modified realistic decision rule of an agent states that if the observed stimuli @xmath8 is negative , an agent decides to select the first patch ( therefore interpreting the difference in contrast as negative ) , in the case of positive value , the second option is selected .    in particular , psychometric curves which are cumulative of the normal distribution : @xmath11 result in a good fit for the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 can be interpreted as the participant s uncertainty about the decision .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the bias ( offset ) ; it represents a tendency to choose a particular answer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : psychometric ] .",
    "the @xmath4 function , defined as above , can be viewed as a convolution of the step function ( the correct answer ) and the gaussian distribution ( the discriminative error ) .     and positive bias @xmath12 . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    for our purposes , we assume that bias is much smaller than the characteristic width parameter , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , @xmath10 becomes the main determinant of the effectiveness of discrimination .",
    "it is convenient to choose the maximal slope of the psychometric function @xmath14 as the primary measure of the responding agent s effectiveness .",
    "now , we can proceed to extending the @xcite models .",
    "we would like to know how the performance of a group of @xmath2 people depends upon their individual cognitive performances .",
    "therefore , we need to solve the explicit formulas for the propagation of slopes and biases when combining several responders within each of the different models of communication : @xmath15 each model is described by the shared decision function @xmath16\\label{eq : pmodel},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a functional . for all but two models that we investigate , @xmath18 $ ] ,",
    "that is , the dependence is pointwise ( i.e. , result for a given @xmath3 requires only knowing individual @xmath19 for the same @xmath3 ) .",
    "we can obtain the effective slope and bias using straightforward formulas that involve taking the derivative of the psychometric function with respect to the stimulus : @xmath20 \\approx \\frac{p_{model}(0)-\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left.p_{model}'(c)\\right|_{c=0}},\\label{eq : biasdiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where assuming the approximation for the relative error for both @xmath21 and @xmath12 is of order @xmath22 ( or equivalently , @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 stands for big @xmath25 notation .",
    "the derivation is in [ s : approx ] .",
    "note that if @xmath26 is a cumulative gaussian function ( as in ) , then the formulas for slope and are equivalent .",
    "however , it can be used as a _ definition _ of the slope and the bias in the general case of an arbitrary communication strategy @xmath26 , even if does not hold .",
    "bear in mind that for practical applications , we expect @xmath26 to be close enough to the cumulative gaussian function .",
    "moreover , when there are no biases , for all decision - making considered in this paper , the maximal slope is at @xmath27 .",
    "a question arises about the relation between the psychometric curve parameters and the expected rate of errors .",
    "to assess the average amount of incorrect answers we could expect from a responder , we introduced the following quantity , @xmath28dc\\\\    & = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\sigma \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac{b^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right ) + b\\left [ 2h\\left(\\tfrac{b}{\\sigma}\\right)-1 \\right]\\label{eq : penaltyres},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we integrated the error function @xcite . for a uniform distribution and range of stimuli , @xmath29 for @xmath30 ,",
    "the rate of the incorrect responses is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the average number of wrong answers is always reduced when lowering either width or bias , regardless of the other parameter s value .",
    "this fact further justifies the choice of the slope as the proper effectiveness measure . when there is no bias , simplifies to @xmath32 ; thus , the rate of the incorrect responses is @xmath33 .",
    "in this section , we discuss different models of information sharing for @xmath2 participants .",
    "it is important to underline that the models incorporate the process of perceiving ( what the subjects may know ) , the state of mind ( what the subjects know ) , and the communication and the decision - making process ( usually bayes - optimal ) .",
    "we briefly define the assumptions of each model and justify it in psychological terms .",
    "we give results in terms of the effective psychometric function , @xmath26 , the effective slope , @xmath34 , and sometimes the effective bias , @xmath35 ( as for a few models the bias is poorly defined ) . whenever calculations of @xmath26 are not straightforward , we give some insight into the underlying mathematics .",
    "we investigate the following models :    * [ s : rr ] random responder , * [ s : vot ] voting , * [ s : bd ] best decides , * [ s : wcs ] weighted confidence sharing , * [ s : dss ] direct signal sharing , * [ s : tw ] truth wins .",

    "random factors determine the collective decision , i.e. , communication is seen as ineffective within framework of this model .",
    "sometimes the decision is not based on any evidence and people may have very misleading impressions of their own accuracy . additionally , their decisions may depend more upon a group member s charisma or persuasive skills than his or her psychometric skills . in the work of @xcite ,",

    "the study by @xcite suggests that this model most accurately describes dyad performance .",
    "given relative confidences @xmath60 , the group has to determine whether to choose the first or the second option .",

    ", it may serve to examine social decision scheme theory @xcite , wherein the group decision is considered to be a function of individual choices , regardless of skills , confidences or the difficulty of the task .",

    "it is possible that beyond a certain critical size , groups start to perform worse @xcite .",
    "the models we consider do not predict such a collapse , as they are based on information sharing and do not incorporate phenomena related to motivation and social or technical ability to work in groups .",
    "in the paper , we examined mathematical models for solving a two - choice discriminative task by a group of participants .",
    "we were interested in how group performance depended upon the performance of the individuals , their ways of communication and their modes of decision aggregation .",
    "as a measure of performance , we used the slope of the psychometric function , which indicates how performance changes with the difficulty of the task .",
    "the higher the slope of @xmath21 is , the better the performance of the individual ( or the group ) .",

    "consequently , they can be considered only in particular tasks , in which a certain level of confidence in an individual s own answer can be reached",
    ". our list of models is by no means exhaustive .",
    "we need to be aware of the fact that the presented models are valid only for our specific situation ( collaborative decisions in a two - choice perceptive task wherein difficulty can be smoothly adjusted ) .",
    "other tasks may be analyzed within the same paradigm , such as integrating information in an individual s mind .",
    "several exposures to the same stimulus by a single person , perhaps using different senses or with different noise levels , would be another subject for further investigation .",
    "such an approach is presented in experiments on sensory integration , e.g. , by @xcite , which serve as one of the motivations for the @xcite models .",
    "perhaps collaborative decisions in other two - choice tasks ( e.g. , verbal or mathematical decisions ) could also be treated in a similar fashion . however , for many other settings , more advanced models are needed , e.g. , ones that take into account more choices or the dynamic interaction between solving a problem in an individual s mind and communicating that decision to the other participants .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the first step should be to experimentally verify the predicted results of this paper ( with an emphasis on the scaling of the performance ) , before proceeding to more advanced theoretical models .",
