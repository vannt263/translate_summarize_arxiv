    "three - dimensional cone - manifold is a metric space obtained from a collection of disjoint simplices in the space of constant sectional curvature @xmath4 by isometric identification of their faces in such a combinatorial fashion that the resulting topological space is a manifold ( also called the underlying space for a given cone - manifold ) .",
    "such the metric space inherits the metric of sectional curvature @xmath4 on the union of its @xmath5- and @xmath6-dimensional cells . in case",
    "@xmath7 the corresponding cone - manifold is called spherical ( or admits a spherical structure ) . by analogy , one defines euclidean ( @xmath8 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath9 ) cone - manifolds .",
    "the metric structure around each @xmath10-cell is determined by a cone angle that is the sum of dihedral angles of corresponding simplices sharing the @xmath10-cell under identification .",
    "the singular locus of a cone - manifold is the closure of all its 1-cells with cone angle different from @xmath11 . for the further account",
    "we suppose that every component of the singular locus is an embedded circle with constant cone angle along it . for the further account ,",
    "see @xcite .",
