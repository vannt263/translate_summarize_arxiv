    "the detection of high energy neutrinos ( @xmath2 gev ) is crucial to identify the extreme energy sources in the universe , and possibly to unveil the puzzle of cosmic rays with energy above the gzk cutoff@xcite .",
    "these proposed scientific aims are well beyond the scope of the conventional high energy gamma - ray astronomy . because of",
    "the expected small flux of the high energy neutrinos , large scale detectors ( @xmath3 km@xmath4 ) seem to be needed to obtain the first evidence .",
    "there are two different strategies to detect the footprints of high energy neutrinos . the first strategy is implemented by installing detectors in a large volume of ice or water where most of the scatterings between the candidate neutrinos and nucleons occur essentially inside the detector , whereas the second strategy aims at detecting the air showers caused by the charged leptons produced by the neutrino - nucleon scatterings taking place inside the earth or in the air , far away from the instrumented volume of the detector .",
    "the latter strategy thus include the possibility of detection of quasi horizontal incident neutrinos which are also referred to as the earth - skimming neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos are considered to interact below the horizon of an earth based surface detector .",
    "the second strategy is proposed only recently@xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory group has simulated the anticipated detection of the air - showers from the decays of @xmath5 leptons@xcite .",
    "the tau air - shower event rates resulting from the earth - skimming tau neutrinos for different high energy neutrino telescopes are given in@xcite .",
    "a monte - carlo study of tau air - shower event rate was also reported not long ago@xcite .",
    "we note that ref.@xcite does not consider the tau - lepton energy distribution in the @xmath6-nucleon scattering , and only the incident tau neutrinos with energies greater than @xmath7 gev are considered . for ref.@xcite , we note that only the sum of tau air - shower event rates arising from different directions is given",
    ". hence some of the events may be due to tau - leptons / neutrinos traversing a large distance .",
    "as a result , it is not possible to identify the source of tau - neutrino flux even with the observation of tau - lepton induced air - shower .    in this work",
    ", we shall focus on the high energy earth - skimming neutrinos and shall calculate the energy spectrum of their induced tau - leptons , taking into account the inelasticity of neutrino - nucleon scatterings and the tau - lepton energy loss in detail .",
    "our work differs from ref.@xcite by our emphasis on the earth - skimming neutrinos .",
    "we shall present our results in the form of outgoing tau - lepton spectra for different distances inside the rock , instead of integrating the energy spectra .",
    "as will be demonstrated , such spectra are insensitive to the distances traversed by the earth - skimming @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "they are essentially determined by the tau lepton range .",
    "because of this characteristic feature , our results are useful for setting up simulations with specifically chosen air - shower content detection strategy , such as detection of the cherenkov radiation or the air fluorescence .",
    "we start with our semi - analytic description in section ii .",
    "the transport equations governing the evolutions of neutrino and tau - lepton fluxes will be derived . using these",
    ", we then calculate the tau - lepton flux resulting from the resonant @xmath8 scattering . in section iii ,",
    "we summarize our main results , namely the tau - lepton energy spectra due to neutrino - nucleon scatterings",
    ". the implications of our results will be discussed here also . in particular , we shall point out that the ratio of tau - lepton flux induced by rock - skimming neutrinos to that induced by ocean - skimming neutrinos is sensitive to the spectral index of the incident tau - neutrino flux . in section iv",
    ", we discuss some prospects for possible future observations of the associated radiation from these tau leptons .",
    "let us begin with the transport equations for tau neutrinos and tau leptons .",
    "considering only the neutrino - nucleon scatterings , we have = -+ n_n_i=1 ^ 3_y^i_min^y^i_max f_i(e_y , x)(y , e_y ) , [ transport1 ] and & = & --+ + & + & n_n_y_min^y_max f__(e_y , x)(y , e_y ) , [ transport2 ] where @xmath9 the number of target nucleons per unit medium mass , and @xmath10 is the mass density of the medium .",
    "the @xmath11 are defined as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 represents the slant depth traversed by the particles , i.e. , the amount of medium per unit area traversed by the particle ( and thus in units of g / cm@xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 represent the @xmath6 interaction thickness , the tau - lepton decay length , and the tau - lepton charged - current interaction thickness respectively , with , say , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the inelasticity of neutrino - nucleon scatterings , such that the initial and final - state particle energies in the differential cross sections @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath23 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the limits for @xmath24 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on the kinematics of each process . finally , the energy - loss coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined by @xmath32 with @xmath27 the energy being the tau lepton .",
    "an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ transport2 ] ) in the context of atmospheric muons was found in ref.@xcite .    as mentioned before , eqs .",
    "( [ transport1 ] ) and ( [ transport2 ] ) only take into account neutrino - nucleon scatterings .",
    "it is of interest to calculate the tau - lepton fluxes produced by the glashow resonance@xcite , namely via @xmath33 also .",
    "the transport equation for @xmath34 then reads : = -+ n_n_y_min^y_max f_|_e(e_y , x)(y , e_y ) .",
    "[ transport3 ] similarly , the corresponding equation for the tau - lepton flux is given by & = & -- + & + & n_e_y_min^y_max f_|_e(e_y , x)(y , e_y ) , [ transport4 ] where @xmath35 is the number of target electrons per unit medium mass .    before solving the above coupled transport equations , it is essential to know the energy - loss coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as pointed out before@xcite , the coefficient @xmath30 is due to the energy loss by the ionization@xcite , while @xmath31 is contributed by the bremsstrahlung@xcite , the @xmath36 pair production@xcite and the photo - nuclear processes@xcite .",
    "it is understood that the contribution by @xmath30 becomes unimportant for @xmath37 gev .",
    "the coefficient @xmath31 can be parameterized as @xmath38 in the standard rock for @xmath39 .",
    "it is of interest to check the tau - lepton range given by our semi - analytic approach . to do this ,",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ transport2 ] ) by dropping the neutrino term , i.e. , = --+ , [ tau_alone ] with @xmath40 .",
    "one can easily solve it for @xmath41 : f_(e , x)=f_(|e,0 ) , where @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . to calculate the tau - lepton range",
    ", we substitute @xmath45 .",
    "the survival probability @xmath46 for a tau - lepton with an initial energy @xmath47 at @xmath48 is p(e_0,x)=,[prob ] where @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the tau - lepton range is simply r_(e_0)=_0^dx p(e_0,x ) .",
    "[ range ] for @xmath52 gev , we find that @xmath53 km in the standard rock ( @xmath54 ) while @xmath55 km in the iron .",
    "both values are in good agreement with those obtained by monte - carlo calculations@xcite . to compare the tau - lepton ranges , we have followed the convention in ref .",
    "@xcite by requiring the final tau - lepton energy @xmath56 to be greater than @xmath57 gev .",
    "it is to be noted that we obtain @xmath58 by using the continuous tau - lepton energy - loss approach , rather than stochastic approach adopted in ref.@xcite . in the muon case , the continuous approach to the muon energy loss",
    "is known to overestimate the muon range@xcite .",
    "such an overestimate is not significant in the tau - lepton case , because of the decay term in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "in fact , tau lepton decay term dictates the tau range in the rock until @xmath59 gev . even for @xmath60 gev ,",
    "the tau lepton range is still not entirely determined by the tau - lepton energy loss .",
    "hence different treatments on the tau - lepton energy loss do not lead to large differences in the tau - lepton range , in contrast to the case for the muon range .",
    "our result for the tau - lepton range up to @xmath61 gev are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figone ] .",
    "this is an extension of the result in ref.@xcite , where the tau - lepton range is calculated only up to @xmath62 gev .",
    "our extension is seen explicitly in the addition of charged - current scattering term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ tau_alone ] ) .",
    "this term is necessary because @xmath63 becomes comparable to @xmath64 in the rock for @xmath65 gev ; whereas one does not need to include the contribution by the tau - lepton neutral - current scattering , since such a contribution can not compete with the last term in eq .",
    "( [ tau_alone ] ) until @xmath66 gev@xcite .",
    "we remark that our extended results for @xmath58 are subject to the uncertainties of neutrino - nucleon scattering cross section at high energies .",
    "we use the cteq6 parton distribution functions@xcite in this work , and at the high energy ( the small @xmath67 region , namely for @xmath68 ) , we fit these parton distribution functions into the form proportional to @xmath69 as a guide .",
    "having checked the tau - lepton range , we now proceed to calculate the tau - lepton flux .",
    "it is instructive to begin with the simple case : the @xmath1 resonant scattering .",
    "it is well known that@xcite ( |_e e^-w^-|_^-)= , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "we shall only focus on those @xmath34 s for which @xmath73 satisfies the resonance condition , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ transport4 ] ) that @xmath41 only depends on @xmath75 , because of the narrow peak nature of @xmath1 scattering cross section .",
    "one also expects that @xmath41 is only significant for @xmath27 around the resonance energy @xmath76 . in this energy region",
    ", one may neglect the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ transport4 ] ) in comparison with the second term . in the narrow width approximation , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ transport4 ] ) can be recast into @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the width of the @xmath79 boson while @xmath80 is the interaction thickness of the resonant @xmath81 scattering ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the tau lepton flux can be readily obtained once @xmath75 is given .",
    "we observe that the regeneration term in eq .",
    "( [ transport3 ] ) ( second term on the r.h.s . ) can be neglected as it is necessarily off the @xmath79 boson peak .",
    "hence , we easily obtain @xmath82 . substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ transport4 ] ) , we obtain = 3.3 10 ^ -4(1-)^2 ( -),[res_tau ] in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath84 is obtained by assuming a standard - rock medium . in water",
    "it becomes @xmath85 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath86 in the above equation .",
    "we shall see later that the contribution to @xmath41 by the @xmath79-resonance is negligible compared to that by the @xmath87 scattering .",
    "let us now turn to the case of tau - lepton production by the @xmath87 charged - current scattering .",
    "the tau - lepton flux can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ transport1 ] ) and ( [ transport2 ] ) once the incoming @xmath6 flux is given .",
    "the @xmath6 flux can be obtained by the following ansatz@xcite : f__(e , x)=f__(e,0 ) ( - ) , where @xmath88 , with the factor @xmath89 arising from the regeneration effect of the @xmath6 flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the tau - lepton flux is given by f_(e , x)&=&_0^x dt g_(|e , t ) + & & , [ tau_flux ] with @xmath90 , and g_(e , x)=n_n_y_min^y _ maxf_(e_y , x ) ( y , e_y ) .",
    "[ source ] it is easy to see that the factor @xmath89 enters into the expression for @xmath41 through the function @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 also depends on @xmath41 .",
    "it is possible to solve for @xmath89 and @xmath41 simultaneously by the iteration method@xcite .",
    "the details are given in appendix b.",
    "in the following , we show the tau - lepton fluxes resulting from three kinds of diffuse astrophysical neutrino fluxes : the agn@xcite , grb@xcite and gzk@xcite neutrino fluxes . in these representative models",
    ", @xmath92 arises because of neutrino flavor mixing@xcite .",
    "the @xmath93 interactions are the source of intrinsic @xmath94 , and @xmath95 because of ( two ) neutrino flavor oscillations during propagation .",
    "our convention for @xmath92 is that @xmath96 in the unit of @xmath97 s@xmath98 sr@xmath98 .",
    "the same convention is used for the outgoing tau lepton fluxes .    in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] , we show the outgoing tau - lepton energy spectra resulting from the propagation of incident agn neutrinos inside the rock ( @xmath99 ) for @xmath100 km , @xmath101 km and @xmath102 km respectively .",
    "it is interesting to see that the tau - lepton energy spectra remain almost unchanged for the above three different slant depths / matter density ratio values .",
    "this feature can be understood by two simple facts .",
    "first of all , the neutrino - nucleon charged - current interaction length , which is related to the interaction thickness by @xmath103 , is given by @xmath104 .",
    "secondly , the tau leptons , which eventually exit the earth , ought to be produced within a tau - lepton - range distance to the exit point . for a tau - lepton produced far away from the exit point",
    ", it loses energy and decays before reaching to the exit point .",
    "hence the tau - lepton flux is primarily determined by the ratio of tau - lepton range to the charged current neutrino - nucleon interaction length . the total slant depth @xmath15 which the tau - neutrino ( tau - lepton ) traverses inside the earth is then unimportant , unless @xmath15 is large enough such that the tau neutrino flux attenuates significantly before tau - neutrino is converted into the tau - lepton .",
    "we note that the typical energy for the agn neutrinos , in which this flux peaks , is between @xmath105 and @xmath7 gev .",
    "the corresponding neutrino - nucleon neutral current interaction length then ranges from @xmath106 km down to @xmath107 km , given @xmath108 .",
    "hence , even for @xmath109 as large as @xmath102 km , the attenuation of the tau neutrino flux is negligible .",
    "this explains the insensitivity of tau - lepton flux with respect to our chosen @xmath109 values for the agn case .",
    "the situation is rather similar for the tau - lepton flux resulting from the grb tau neutrinos ( see fig .",
    "[ figthree ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a slight suppression is found for the gzk case at @xmath110 gev as one increases @xmath109 from @xmath111 km to @xmath102 km ( see fig .",
    "[ figfour ] ) .",
    "this is because the typical gzk tau neutrino flux peaks for energy range between @xmath112 and @xmath113 gev , which corresponds to attenuation lengths ranging from @xmath114 km down to @xmath115 km .",
    "one notices that @xmath115 km is rather close to the distance @xmath102 km which we choose for @xmath109 .",
    "hence a slight suppression on the tau - lepton flux occurs for @xmath116 km .",
    "we have compared our agn - type tau - lepton flux with that obtained by monte - carlo simulations , adopting stochastic approach for the tau - lepton energy loss@xcite .",
    "the two tau - lepton fluxes agree within @xmath117 .",
    "this is expected since the tau - lepton range obtained by the above two approaches agree well , as pointed out before .",
    "it is easily seen from fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] to fig .",
    "[ figfour ] that the agn case has a largest tau - lepton flux between @xmath118 and @xmath7 gev .",
    "since the resonant @xmath119 scattering cross section peaks at @xmath120 gev , it is of interest to compare the integrated tau - lepton flux resulting from this scattering to the one arising from neutrino - nucleon scattering . for the former case , we integrate the tau - lepton energy spectrum from @xmath118 gev to @xmath121 gev , and obtain @xmath122 . for neutrino - nucleon scattering",
    ", we find that @xmath123 by integrating the corresponding tau - lepton energy spectrum from @xmath118 gev to @xmath112 gev . the detailed results for @xmath124 are summarized in table [ tableone ] .",
    "the entries in the table entitled _ full _ are obtained using the @xmath125 obtained in this work , whereas the approximated values entitled _ approx _ are obtained by following the description given in ref.@xcite , which uses a constant @xmath126 and a constant inelasticity coefficient for @xmath127 scattering .",
    "we remark that the authors in ref.@xcite have taken @xmath27 to be greater than @xmath7 gev .",
    "hence the integrated fluxes in the column _ approx _ with energies less than @xmath128 gev are taken as extrapolations .",
    "thus , one should compare the two integrated fluxes only for @xmath129 gev .",
    "one can see that the two integrated fluxes seem to agree for @xmath130 gev . besides the integrated fluxes for @xmath130 gev",
    ", we also obtain integrated tau - lepton fluxes for @xmath131 .",
    "it is easily seen that , in this energy range , the integrated tau - lepton flux from earth - skimming agn neutrinos is relatively significant .",
    "it is possible that the tau - neutrino skims through a part of the ocean in addition to the earth before exiting the interaction region@xcite .",
    "hence , it is desirable to compare the resulting tau - lepton fluxes as the tau neutrinos skim through mediums with different densities , while the slant depths of mediums are held fixed as an example . as stated before ,",
    "the tau - lepton flux is essentially determined by the probability of @xmath127 charged - current interaction happening within a tau - lepton range . furthermore , from fig .",
    "[ figone ] , it is clear that the tau - lepton range equals to the tau - lepton decay length for @xmath132 less than @xmath112 gev .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath133 for @xmath134 gev .",
    "this is clearly seen to be the case from fig .",
    "[ figfive ] and fig .",
    "[ figsix ] , as we compare @xmath135 with @xmath136 for @xmath137 g / cm@xmath4 and @xmath138 g / cm@xmath4 respectively . for @xmath139 gev ,",
    "the tau - lepton range has additional dependencies on the mass density and the atomic number of the medium .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath140 starts deviating from @xmath141 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the tau - lepton flux ratios for agn and grb cases behave rather similarly .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio in the gzk case has a clear peak between @xmath142 .",
    "such a peak is even more apparent for the slant depth @xmath138 g / cm@xmath4 .",
    "the appearance of this peak has to do with the relatively flat behavior of the incident gzk neutrino spectrum , while the position of this peak is related to the energy dependencies of the tau - lepton range and the neutrino - nucleon scattering cross sections .",
    "we have confirmed our observations by computing the flux ratios with simple power - law incident tau - neutrino fluxes .",
    "the above peak in the tau - lepton flux ratio implies the suppression of tau - lepton events from ocean - skimming neutrinos compared to those from rock - skimming neutrinos .",
    "as stated earlier , the suppression of ocean - skimming neutrinos is related to the spectral index of the incident neutrino flux .",
    "it is therefore useful to perform a detailed simulation for it@xcite .",
    "such a detailed study is needed because the slant depths traversed by the above two kinds of neutrinos are generally different .",
    "to observe the above tau leptons , the acceptance of a detector must be of the order of @xmath143 . for agn neutrinos , the tau - lepton energy spectrum peaks at around @xmath112 to @xmath7 gev , which is below the threshold of a fluorescence detector , such as the high resolution fly s eye ( hires)@xcite",
    ". also , these tau leptons come near horizontally . at present , it seems very difficult to construct a ground array in vertical direction .",
    "a cherenkov telescope seems to be a feasible solution . in this context",
    ", nutel collaboration is developing cherenkov telescopes to detect the earth - skimming high energy neutrinos@xcite .",
    "however , because of the small opening angle of cherenkov light cone and only a 10% duty cycle ( optical observations are limited to moonless and cloudless nights only ) , such a detector must cover very large area and field of view .",
    "a potential site for nutel is at hawaii big island , where two large volcanos , namely mauna loa and mauna kea , could be favorable candidates for high energy neutrinos to interact with . for a detector situated on top of mount hualalai and to look at both mauna kea and mauna loa ,",
    "the required angular field of view is @xmath144 .",
    "furthermore , this telescope should have an acceptance area larger than 2 @xmath145 so as to detect more than one event per year .",
    "concerning the gzk neutrinos , we note that the recent observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays by hires seem to be consistent with the gzk cutoff .",
    "therefore a future observation of gzk tau neutrinos shall provide a firm support to gzk cutoff .",
    "in particular , the slight pile up of tau leptons between @xmath7 gev to @xmath62 gev , induced by the earth - skimming high energy gzk neutrinos , should be a candidate signature for gzk neutrinos .",
    "the integrated tau - lepton flux in this energy range is approximately 0.08 @xmath146 . to detect one event per year from this flux ,",
    "the acceptance of a detector must be larger than 120 @xmath147 , for a fluorescence detector ( assuming a duty cycle of 10% ) .",
    "although hires can reach 1000 @xmath148 at energy @xmath149 gev , it would be a technical challenge to lower down the threshold to @xmath7 gev . using a system similar to hires ,",
    "the dual imaging cherenkov experiment ( dice ) was able to detect cherenkov light from extensive air - showers at energy as low as @xmath105 gev@xcite .",
    "however , the field of view of dice is also quite small , and thus several cherenkov telescopes would be needed .",
    "an alternative method is a hybrid detection of both cherenkov and fluorescence photons@xcite .",
    "that is , a detector similar to hires , which looks at both land and sea and detects both cherenkov and fluorescence photons , may observe the associated signal of gzk neutrinos .    in summary",
    ", we have given a semi - analytic treatment on the problem of simultaneous propagation of high energy tau neutrinos and tau leptons inside the earth .",
    "our treatment explicitly takes into account the inelasticity of neutrino - nucleon scatterings as well as the tau - lepton energy loss .",
    "we specifically considered the earth - skimming situation and provided detailed results for the energy dependencies of emerging tau - lepton fluxes resulting from a few anticipated astrophysical neutrino fluxes .",
    "the effect of matter density on the tau - lepton flux is also studied .",
    "such an effect is found to be related to the spectrum index of incident neutrino flux .",
    "our treatment thus provides a basis for a more complete and realistic assessment of high - energy - neutrino flux measurements in the under - construction / planning large neutrino telescopes .",
