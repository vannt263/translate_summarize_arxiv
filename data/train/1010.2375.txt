    "spin models form an important tool in the understanding of magnetic systems , particularly of multilayers systems such as bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials , because such models allow the investigation of magnetic configurations and dynamics at the atomic scale .",
    "bilayers of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials are important parts of magnetoresistive sensors , used , e.g. , in hard disc read heads .",
    "the role of the antiferromagnetic component is to pin the ferromagnetic layer by the so - called exchange bias effect , @xcite leading to a shift of the hysteresis loop of the ferromagnet .",
    "a number of calculations based on spin models have revealed that the anisotropy of the antiferromagnet and the strength of the interface coupling between antiferromagnet and ferromagnet are crucial for the strength and stability of exchange bias @xcite and therefore for the functioning of the device .",
    "irmn is the most common antiferromagnet industrially because of the large exchange bias and thermal stability that can be obtained with this material . despite the successful application of this material in exchange bias bilayers ,",
    "there is still no complete microscopic understanding of the most important parameters , the antiferromagnetic anisotropy and the interface coupling .",
    "these properties have recently been inferred by a careful examination of the temperature behaviour of the exchange bias of polygranular thin film bilayers@xcite . in order to evaluate the antiferromagnet anisotropy ,",
    "the magnitude of the exchange bias is fitted to a simple model that depends only upon the grain size distribution , yielding effective anisotropy and coupling parameters .",
    "the origin of the effective anisotropy and interface coupling , due to the microscopic physical properties of the interface , remains however inaccessible to direct experimental study .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "only few first principles calculations on relativistic effects in mn - based antiferromagnets have been performed . regarding the anisotropy , umetsu _",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) of l1@xmath1-type mntm ( tm = ni , pd , pt , rh and ir ) compounds and revealed that mnir had the highest mae with a value of -7.05 mev / unit cell .",
    "furthermore , a giant second order magnetic anisotropy for l@xmath2 irmn@xmath0 was reported , leading to energy barriers of the order of @xmath3 = 10.4 mev / unit cell for rotation of the @xmath41 ground state spin - structure around the ( 111 ) axis .",
    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge no first principles calculations of the interface exchange coupling between an antiferromagnet and a ferromagnet have been published to date .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the first part we introduce the concept of the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) merged with the relativistic disordered local moment ( rdlm ) scheme and discuss the details of the first - principles calculations .",
    "then we present our results for the magnetic moments , the exchange coupling and the magnetic anisotropy in l1@xmath5 irmn@xmath0 , fcc co bulk , and for the irmn@xmath0/co(111 ) interface .",

    "mapping of the energy of an itinerant magnetic system onto a spin - hamiltonian presents a longstanding problem in computational solid state physics .",
    "the most widely used approach relies on an adiabatic decoupling of the longitudinal and transverse spin - fluctuations , determined by the fast motion of mobile electrons , @xmath6 , and the slow motion of spins , @xmath7 . under such circumstances",
    ", time - dependent density functional theory can be approximated by a landau - lifshitz equation of motion for the classical spin variables , i.e. , the orientation - field , @xmath8 , as combined with spin - density functional theory ( sdft ) within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "@xcite further simplification of the theory is represented by the rigid spin approximation , in which the orientation of the spins is allowed to change from atomic cell to atomic cell .",
    "a system of @xmath9 spin - moments is thus characterized by the set of orientations ( spin - configurations ) @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "the energy ( grand - potential ) of the system , @xmath12 , determined within lsda then defines a classical hamiltonian that can be used in spin - dynamics simulations .    in order to ensure that the process is tractable",
    ", a suitable parametrization must be applied to @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest reliable approximation , an ( extended ) heisenberg model , is of second order : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the second - order anisotropy matrices ( which are traceless and symmetric ) and the tensorial exchange interactions , respectively . the relativistic torque method ( rtm ) , which was introduced in refs .  , allows the evaluation of these parameters using relativistic electronic structure calculations . by using rtm ,",
    "one is required to choose a reference magnetic configuration ; usually the ferromagnetic state is taken .",
    "for complex magnetic structures , however , the use of such a reference state might lead to incorrect results concerning , e.g. , the magnetic ground state of the system .",
    "@xcite another drawback of rtm is that for systems with reduced point group symmetry the derivation of the anisotropy matrix , @xmath14 , might be quite a cumbersome task .",
    "more importantly , rtm is not directly applicable to the calculation of more complicated two - spin interactions , such as bi - quadratic coupling , or multispin interactions , known to be present in magnetic systems at the nano - scale .",
    "@xcite    the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) developed by drautz and fhnle  @xcite in principle solves the problems mentioned above , in that it provides a systematic parametrization of the adiabatic magnetic energy of general classical spin - systems . in the following we briefly outline the method . considering clusters of @xmath16 sites ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 , the functions @xmath19",

    "the magnetic excitations are modelled by associating local spin - polarization axes with all lattice sites and the orientations @xmath35 vary very slowly on the time - scale of the electronic motion .",
    "these `` local moment '' degrees of freedom produce local magnetic fields centered at the lattice sites which in turn affect the electronic motions and are self - consistently maintained by them .",

    "this implied the calculation of a total number of more than 13,000 tensorial interactions .",
    "inspection of the calculated isotropic exchange interactions reveals that the mn - mn and co - co interactions are spread around their corresponding bulk values due to symmetry breaking at the interface : the nearest neighbor ( nn ) mn - mn interactions are somewhat increased while most of the nn co - co interactions are decreased .",
    "this decrease is of up to 20% near the interface .",

    "in particular for the co layer adjacent to irmn@xmath0 , these two different values are associated with co sites having two and three nn mn atoms .",
    "[ fig : interface - jij ] clearly shows that the effective exchange interactions quickly approach their bulk value with distance from the interface .",
    "this follows from the fact that only interactions between atoms in close proximity to the interface deviate from their counterparts in the bulk ; those more than 2 atomic planes away from the interface are practically bulk - like .",
    "such behavior is to be expected because of the very narrow range of exchange interactions in the bulk systems . since for the chosen magnetic states the magnetic orientations of the mn and co atoms are perpendicular to each other ,",
    "the otherwise weak mn - co interactions are excluded from the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jpi ] ) and the the effective interactions are significantly decreased near the interface .",
    "the different values of @xmath91 for the non - equivalent co sites near to the interface can also be seen in the figure .      the most remarkable observation of our previous study  @xcite was the surprisingly strong , second order ma of irmn@xmath0 resulting from the fact that the cubic symmetry is locally broken for each of the three mn sub - lattices . rotating the @xmath74 state around the axis normal to the @xmath92 plane , the energy of the system can be described as @xmath93 . by calculating @xmath94 in the @xmath74 spin - state ,",

    "[ fig : dm - interface ] , where @xmath113 is shown when @xmath88 indexes a co site and @xmath89 a mn site .    , for nearest neighbour interface co - mn interactions .",
    "the @xmath41 configuration of the mn spins is indicated by arrows within circles at the mn positions .",
    "note that the plane of the co atoms are above the irmn@xmath0 layer . ]    the interface dm vectors are found to lie almost entirely in the interface plane which favours a perpendicular spin alignment of the co relative to the interface . which of the two perpendicular directions is favoured depends upon the sense of the dm vectors and the mn spin configuration : for the mn configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm - interface ] , co alignment away from the irmn@xmath0 layer is preferred .",
    "simultaneous inversion of the spins on all three mn sublattices , which does not affect the chirality of the mn spin structure , produces a configuration that is energetically equivalent in the bulk , but which causes the preferred orientation of the co layers at an interface to be reversed .",
    "note , however , that such a change in the mn spin configuration can not be obtained by any single global rotation .",
    "we have introduced a new computational scheme to calculate magnetic anisotropy parameters and tensorial exchange interactions based on a spin - cluster expansion and the relativistic disordered local moment picture of itinerant magnets .",
    "the method relies on the high - temperature paramagnetic phase , thus , it is , uniquely applicable to any system with arbitrary magnetic ground state . in particular , it is highly efficient in cases when the complex magnetic structure of the system is not known a priori from first principles total energy calculations , such as for heterogeneous interfaces and nanoparticles .",
    "moreover , the sce - rdlm method can be used to calculate higher order multispin interactions .",
    "the main limitation of the method is that longitudinal spin - fluctuations are neglected : in case of large induced moments further extension of the theory is needed.@xcite    we applied the new method to calculate magnetic anisotropies and spin - interactions at an irmn@xmath0/co(111 ) interface .",
    "our main observation is that the corresponding bulk properties are influenced in the immediate vicinity of the interface only .",
    "the exchange interaction between the mn and co atoms are weak leaving the corresponding bulk magnetic structures fairly unaffected even at the interface .",
    "symmetry breaking at the interface gives , however , rise to large anisotropy effects .",
    "most prominently , the appearance of sizeable dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions at the interface results in to a perpendicular coupling of the co and mn spins and to unidirectional exchange anisotropy that might substantially influence the exchange bias in such systems.@xcite by using the spin - model parameters derived in this work , we are going to present a detailed study to explore the spin - dynamics and the exchange bias properties of the irmn@xmath0/co(111 ) interface .",
