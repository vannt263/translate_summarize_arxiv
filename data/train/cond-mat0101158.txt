    "despite a wealth of recent experimental investigations , it seems that there is no consensus yet as to the characteristics of the collective behaviour of vibrated granular mono- or multi - layers @xcite . among the statistical properties of interest , the velocity fluctuations and more precisely the deviations from maxwell - boltzmann distribution due to",
    "inelastic collisions have been intensively studied for rapid granular flows , and several groups reported an overpopulated high energy tail that can be fitted by stretched exponentials with various exponents .",
    "theoretical investigations commonly use the inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) model @xcite , which has proven very useful despite the simplicity of its definition : smooth hard spheres undergo binary inelastic momentum conserving collisions , thereby losing during the collision a constant fraction of their relative normal velocity ( and therefore loosing energy ) .",
    "many studies have concentrated on the homogeneous cooling state of the ihs @xcite , obtained by letting the system evolve without any energy injection . on the other hand ,",
    "experiments on strongly vibrated granular media consider systems that are heated by an external forcing ( e.g. a vertically oscillating plate ) to compensate for the energy loss due to collisions , and are therefore in a non equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) .",
    "various ways of modeling the heating mechanism have been put forward , mostly consisting in the study of an effective system with a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath0 , in which the energy lost through collisions is balanced by energy injected by random `` kicks '' @xcite . in this context , analytical and numerical results have been obtained for the high energy tail of the velocity distributions and for its fourth cumulant , a natural measure of the deviation from a gaussian distribution @xcite . moreover , more realistic molecular dynamics simulations of vibrated soft sphere mono - layers @xcite have been able to reproduce the phenomenology obtained in some experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative modeling of a three - dimensional system shaken vertically along the @xmath3 axis , for which the velocities are studied both numerically and analytically in the horizontal ( @xmath4 ) plane .",
    "if the collisions with the boundaries are elastic , the vibrating wall feeds energy in the system in the @xmath3 direction only , but not in the @xmath4 plane where the correponding two dimensional energy is either lost or gained at each collision between two grains . upon restricting to the @xmath4 velocities ,",
    "we obtain a system that is subject to an effective stationary dynamics with sequential energy injection or dissipation consecutive to particle - particle collisions only .",
    "we shall thus disregard the vibrating boundary and concentrate on the effective planar dynamics where energy gains and losses statistically cancel in the ness , so that an effective restitution coefficient can either be larger or smaller than @xmath1 ; this will be accounted for by a _",
    "@xmath0 , drawn from a probability distribution @xmath5 ( such that the second moment @xmath6 in order to conserve energy on average ) .",
    "our approach , in which momentum transfer occurs only through collisions , consequently differs from the situations investigated in @xcite where energy is injected globally into the system at regular time intervals through a stochastic external force . clearly , the functional form of @xmath5 reflects the energy injection mechanism , and it is a difficult task to establish this connection .",
    "the physical situations that could be described by the present model are mono- or multi - layers of grains provided the interactions with the wall are elastic , or a multilayer system with arbitrary interactions with the wall , in a `` bulk '' region far from the boundaries where energy and density can be considered as constant . in a very different context , a similar stochastic coefficient of restitution has been introduced to study the dynamics of a one - dimensional granular gas , thereby accounting for internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after setting the general framework in section ii , we consider the two - dimensional projection of three - dimensional simulations of inelastic hard spheres with constant restitution coefficient @xmath0 , energy being injected in the third direction ( section iii ) .",
    "we analyze in particular the distribution of energy transfer through collisions . in section iv , the two dimensional ihs model with random restitution coefficient",
    "is then studied by analytical and numerical means .",
    "section v is devoted to a short investigation of the one - dimensional case , and some conclusions are finally presented in section vi .",
    "in the inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) model , grains are modeled as smooth hard spheres of mass @xmath7 undergoing binary , inelastic and momentum - conserving collisions : a collision between two spheres labeled by @xmath1 and @xmath8 , with velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , dissipates a fraction @xmath11 of the component of the relative velocity @xmath12 along the center - to - center direction @xmath13 . noting with stars the post - collision velocities , this translates into @xmath14 , while the tangential relative velocity ( perpendicular to @xmath15 ) is conserved , i.e. : @xmath16 these equations are also sometimes written in terms of restituting collisions , i.e. for collisions which yield @xmath17 as postcollisional velocities , for precollisional velocities @xmath18 : @xmath19      the enskog - boltzmann equation describes the evolution of the one - particle distribution function @xmath20 , upon the molecular chaos hypothesis @xcite . in the homogeneous case ,",
    "for hard spheres of diameter @xmath21 , in @xmath22 dimensions , this equation reads : @xmath23 the prime on the integration symbol is a shortcut for @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the heavyside function , while @xmath26 accounts for excluded volume effects ( for elastic hard spheres , @xmath26 coincides with the density dependent pair correlation function at contact ) . the forcing mechanism necessary to sustain a ness can be of different types , and has not been introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ensk ] ) .",
    "this issue will be addressed in section iv .      because of analytical , numerical and experimental evidences , it is customary to look for scaling solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ensk ] ) , in the form @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density and the thermal velocity @xmath29 is by definition related to the temperature @xmath30 through @xmath31 , where in turn the temperature is defined by the average kinetic energy of the particles : @xmath32    replacing the scaling function in eq ( [ eq : ensk ] ) , together with the law of evolution of the temperature ( see @xcite for details ) yields the following equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in the elastic case ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the gaussian @xmath39 ( since @xmath40 ) .",
    "the deviations from @xmath41 are studied by an expansion in terms of sonine polynomials @xcite @xmath42 indeed , the coefficients @xmath43 can be obtained from the moments of @xmath38 , because the @xmath44 satisfy the orthogonality relations : @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are normalization constants .",
    "these polynomials consequently depend on the dimension @xmath22 ; the first ones read : @xmath47 the orthogonality properties allow to write @xmath48 in particular , @xmath49 vanishes because of the definition of temperature , and @xmath50 is related to the fourth cumulant of @xmath38 : @xmath51 in section iv , we shall briefly recall the different steps involved in the computation of @xmath50 that quantifies the deviations from gaussianity .      the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method allows to solve numerically the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : ensk ] ) @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully used e.g. for the study of the homogeneous cooling state of the ihs , in @xcite to assess the validity of the sonine expansion , and in @xcite to analyze the high energy tail of @xmath38 . in @xcite , the case of heated granular fluids has also been considered and compared to the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "the positions of the particles do not appear in equation ( [ eq : ensk ] ) .",
    "therefore all reference to space is here useless ; this amounts , in the usual dsmc language , to taking only one cell where all particles stand , and of course eliminates the possibility to study spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "moreover , upon an appropriate rescaling of time , we shall take @xmath52 and @xmath53 . since no external force is present",
    ", the velocities of the particles do not change between collisions , and no `` free streaming stage '' is here necessary , and the simulation has the following scheme : we start from @xmath54 particles with random velocities taken from an arbitrary distribution ( e.g. gaussian , or flat ) ; then the evolution proceeds by choosing at random pairs of particles @xmath55 , a direction @xmath56 for their center to center direction , and updating their velocities according to the collision rule with a probability proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "once a stationary state is reached , running averages can be taken on the quantities of interest .",
    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations integrate the exact equation of motion of the model , with no reference to the boltzmann equation : we consider @xmath54 spheres of diameter @xmath21 , in a box of linear size @xmath58 in dimension @xmath22 , with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these spheres initially have random velocities , and we use an event - driven algorithm to study their dynamics . once more , running averages are taken once a stationary state is reached .",
    "we consider an ihs model with constant ( velocity independent ) restitution coefficient @xmath59 , in dimension @xmath60 , the cartesian coordinates being labeled @xmath61 and @xmath3 .",
    "the collisions are dissipative but energy is re - injected in the vertical direction ( @xmath3 ) in the following way : after each collision , the @xmath3-component of the velocity of the particles having collided is randomly drawn from a gaussian distribution at fixed temperature , while the @xmath62 components remain those resulting from the initial inelastic collision .",
    "this procedure is intended to mimic both the energy injection due to a vibrating wall , and transfer to horizontal degrees of freedom through collisions only : indeed , a vibrating boundary can yield in the bulk of a multi - layer system an equilibrated gaussian vertical velocity  @xcite .",
    "we could have used different vertical velocity distributions , in particular asymetric ones , with the same conclusion : the point here is to illustrate the horizontal energy tranfer mechanism .",
    "let us indeed analyze the system in the horizontal plane ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "after a transient , the two - dimensional temperature @xmath63 remains stationary ( see the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : deltaeproj ] ) : overall , i.e. when the three components of the velocities are considered , a collision is dissipative , but in the @xmath4-plane , energy can be gained by a transfer from the @xmath3-direction . in the horizontal plane ,",
    "both phenomena compensate each other , as appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaeproj ] : the histogram of the energy transferred in the @xmath4-plane at each collision ( given by @xmath64 , where @xmath1 and @xmath8 label the two colliding particles ) has of course a negative part but also a positive one , corresponding to an energy gain in the @xmath4-plane thought a three - dimensional collision ( the positive part would be absent in a simulation without heating and constant @xmath65 ) .",
    "this positive part compensates the energy loss and allows to reach a ness with a constant @xmath66",
    ".    it would be feasible to inject energy in a more refined way , by considering for instance the collisions with the vibrating wall .",
    "seeking for analytical results concerning the 2d horizontal velocity distribution , we shall however make the simplifying assumption that the effective 2d restitution coefficient decouples from the impact relative velocity .",
    "the resulting zeroth order modeling introduced below displays qualitatively the same energy transfer behaviour as the projected 3d system and is amenable to a kinetic theory description .",
    "we shall hereafter consider an ihs model for which , at each collision , the restitution coefficient is drawn from a probability distribution @xmath5 .",
    "the means over @xmath5 will be denoted by an overline , and the distribution of @xmath67 by @xmath68 . since ,",
    "in a binary collision with restitution coefficient @xmath0 , the energy change is : @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the relative velocity before collision , @xmath71 the center to center direction , and @xmath7 the mass of the particles ) , and since the value of @xmath0 is taken uncorrelated with the velocities of the particles , we shall consider distributions with @xmath6 in order to ensure a stationary , constant temperature regime ( at each collision , energy changes , but is conserved on average : @xmath72 ) .",
    "moreover , we will restrict ourselves to positive values of @xmath0 .",
    "since the average energy is constant , the granular temperature is also a constant determined by the initial velocity distribution .",
    "this model is therefore intended to study the distribution of _ rescaled _ velocities @xmath73 .",
    "the methods of @xcite for the case of constant normal restitution ( with or without external heating ) can be easily applied to the case of random @xmath0 to systematically obtain the coefficients of the sonine expansion .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for details and sketch only the principal steps .",
    "note that the calculation is made under the hypothesis of a small @xmath50 : the sonine expansion ( [ eq : sonine ] ) is therefore truncated after second order and besides , terms of order @xmath74 are discarded ( it is possible to go beyond the linear approximation in @xmath50 , with again truncation of ( [ eq : sonine ] ) after @xmath75 ; it was however shown that in the case of constant @xmath0 , the correction is less than @xmath76  @xcite ) .    once the moments @xmath36 have been defined , multiplying the equation ( [ eq : ftilde ] ) by @xmath77 and integrating over @xmath78 yields @xmath79 taking @xmath80 and approximating @xmath38 by its second order sonine expansion , it is now possible to evaluate @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , that can be averaged over @xmath0 : @xmath84 with @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the volume of the @xmath22-dimensional unit sphere ) .",
    "inserting these relations in ( [ eq : mupmu2 ] ) and neglecting terms of order @xmath74 leads to the final expression for @xmath50 in dimension @xmath22 : @xmath88 it can be checked that the expression obtained in  @xcite is recovered in the case of constant @xmath0 : when @xmath89 , we get @xmath90 moreover , in the case @xmath6 , expression ( [ eq : a2 ] ) reduces to @xmath91 the values of @xmath50 corresponding to the various distributions of normal restitutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoalpha ] , are given in appendix a.    an important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a2 ] ) is that the fourth cumulant depends only on @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 : two different distributions @xmath5 having the same first , second and fourth moments should then yield very similar velocity distributions .",
    "this will be checked numerically in the next subsection and can be considered as a test for the consistency of the linear order approximation in @xmath50 underlying the analytical computation .",
    "the question of the high energy tail , which was addressed in  @xcite by neglecting the gain term in the collision integral @xmath95 , turns out to be more problematic .",
    "whenever @xmath0 is allowed to take values exceeding 1 , the gain term can no longer be discarded and we could not obtain analytical predictions .",
    "we shall therefore resort to a numerical resolution of the boltzmann equation and to molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the high velocity statistics .",
    "it can however be shown that the velocity distribution is gaussian in the elastic case only [ i.e. for @xmath96 , see appendix b ] .",
    "we have simulated the ihs model with random restitution coefficient in two dimensions for various distributions @xmath5 , both with dsmc and md methods .",
    "the dsmc simulations were performed with @xmath97 particles , the md ones with up to @xmath98 particles , and packing fractions from @xmath76 to @xmath99 .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath0 were drawn from distributions of various types : bimodal or trimodal distributions , flat distributions , flat distributions of @xmath67 , gaussian distributions of @xmath67 ( with a cutoff in zero to ensure that @xmath100 ) .",
    "the distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoalpha ] : no large values of @xmath0 or pathological distributions will be used .",
    "the stationarity of the kinetic energy ( following from @xmath101 ) is controlled during the simulation , and allows to obtain in a single run the velocity distribution with a precision of typically @xmath102 to @xmath103 orders of magnitude .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaemddsmc ] the histogram of the energy transfers during the collisions , corresponding to various @xmath5 , for both dsmc and md simulations ; the similarity with the results of the 3 dimensional simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaeproj ] ) allows to validate the model as far as energy transfer is concerned ( the precise form of the histogram depends on the probability distributions @xmath5 , but the qualitative features are those displayed by the projected 3d system considered in section iii ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compmddsmc ] shows the velocity distributions for a flat @xmath68 between @xmath104 and @xmath8 , for dsmc and md simulations .",
    "the agreement between both sets of data is remarkable , and was also checked for other choices of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the curves obtained in md simulations with small or large packing fractions ( up to 40% ) are indistinguishable ( not shown ) .",
    "the inset shows that the distribution of impact parameters in molecular dynamics simulations is flat , which is a hint that no violation of molecular chaos is observed and an indication that the factorization of the 2-particle correlation function resulting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ensk ] ) holds .",
    "the super - imposition of md ( where _ a priori _ inhomogeneities and/or violations of molecular chaos could appear ) , and dsmc results is in contrast with the phenomenology at constant @xmath0 @xcite or with randomly driven ihs  @xcite , and is probably due to an efficient randomization of the velocities with the collision rule of the present model . for a constant dissipative restitution parameter ,",
    "colliding particles emerge with more parallel velocities than in the elastic case @xmath37 .",
    "when they recollide , their velocities are still more parallel . here , this mechanism for the creation of velocity correlations violating molecular chaos seems removed by the possibility of having @xmath105 .",
    "this validates the theoretical approach based on the boltzmann equation .",
    "the remainder of this article is devoted to the deviations from gaussianity that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : compmddsmc ] . to this aim , we shall use dsmc simulations that allow to obtain precise velocity distributions for a larger range of velocities than the md method .",
    "however , as stated above , we always observed an excellent agreement between dsmc and md velocity statistics , up to the resolution of md .",
    "the theoretical ( from eq ( [ eq : a2 ] ) ) and measured ( from the fourth moment of the velocity distribution ) values of @xmath50 are given in table 1 .",
    "for small @xmath50 the measured and theoretical values agree perfectly , while for larger @xmath50 the agreement is worse , probably due to the neglect of quadratic @xmath74 and higher order terms in the derivation of the theoretical formula .",
    "in fact the disagreement is at most of @xmath106 when @xmath107 , comparably to the results for constant @xmath0 .",
    "as predicted , the same value of the fourth cumulant @xmath50 is associated with distributions having the same first , second and fourth moments [ see eq . ( [ eq : a2bis ] ) ] . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : trimodal_flat ] shows strong numerical evidence that , _ in this case _ , the whole distributions of velocities are indistinguishable , i.e. not only @xmath50 but the complete statistics ( including large velocities ) depend only on the first moments of @xmath5 . of course",
    ", for other @xmath5 , this property may not be true anymore .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sonine ] , we show the comparison between the normalized velocity distribution for two distributions of restitution coefficients , together with the sonine prediction @xmath108 . in the case of",
    "small @xmath50 , the agreement is striking : the sonine expansion is supposed to be valid for small values of @xmath109 , while we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sonine ] an agreement up to relatively large @xmath109 . for larger @xmath50",
    ", the global shape corresponds to the prediction , but the quantitative agreement is lost .",
    "this is quite expected since , when @xmath50 is not very small , higher order terms in the sonine expansion become relevant .",
    "-1 cm    we now turn to the study of the large velocity tails . a first indication is given by the plot of the derivative of @xmath110 , which is linear for a gaussian , and constant for an exponential law .",
    "an @xmath111 tail on the other hand leads to a @xmath112 behaviour .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : derivlog ] that the non gaussianity is indeed revealed by this criterion , but that the numerical noise hinders any clear conclusion on the value of @xmath113 . since our velocity statistics are smooth over @xmath103 orders of magnitude , this approach is unable to determine the values of @xmath113 , even if @xmath2 behaves asymptotically as a stretched exponential .",
    "figure [ fig : fits ] on the other hand shows three fits , for three distributions of restitution coefficients .",
    "these fits are of the form @xmath111 , and we obtain a wide range of possible values for @xmath113 : seems to depend on the first moments of @xmath5 only . ] from @xmath114 to @xmath8 , with fits accurate over 6 orders in magnitude .",
    "in particular , a convenient choice of @xmath5 is compatible with @xmath115 , which has been found in some experiments  @xcite ( close to @xmath116 obtained in  @xcite for randomly driven ihs fluids ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath5 [ trimodal @xmath117 with @xmath118 , or equivalently flat @xmath119 $ ] ] , is not very broad and does not imply the use of particularly large values of @xmath0 .",
    "other choices of @xmath5 can also lead to an exponential tail ( @xmath120 ) , similarly to the case of the homogeneous cooling state ( constant @xmath65 , with no heating ) , or even to larger distributions with @xmath121 .",
    "for completeness , we briefly report the results obtained for the one - dimensional version of the random-@xmath0 model ; it should correspond to a projection in one dimension of a two - dimensional system , with energy injection along the projection direction .",
    "the study of the projected model defined in section iii ( injection of energy by randomly drawing the @xmath122-component of the velocity after each collision ) yields similar results as those obtained in the case of a three - dimensional system projected in 2d .",
    "the random-@xmath0 model however displays a certain number of pathologies : for @xmath123 and @xmath6 , we obtain analytically @xmath124 from eq.([eq : a2bis ] ) .",
    "this large value , independent of @xmath5 ( i.e. non perturbative ) , indicates that the sonine expansion is not valid .",
    "in fact , numerical investigations ( both md and dsmc ) show that the velocity distributions @xmath2 have power law tails ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "this behaviour differs significantly from a gaussian and explains the failure of the sonine approximation .",
    "we have introduced the idea of a random restitution coefficient in the ihs model to describe a vertically vibrated layer of granular material .",
    "since energy is injected only along the vertical axis , and transferred through collisions in the perpendicular directions , our approach accounts for the fact ( as shown in section iii ) that the projection in @xmath8 dimensions of a @xmath125-dimensional collision can correspond to a gain in the two - dimensional energy , and therefore to an effective restitution coefficient @xmath0 larger than @xmath1 , even if the genuine @xmath0 necessarily corresponds to a dissipative collision . the model is consequently studied in 2 dimensions , with a probability distribution @xmath5 for the restitution coefficient",
    "we have analyzed the velocity distributions , and in particular the deviation from the maxwellian , using the sonine expansion technique .",
    "following @xcite we obtained analytically the expression of the fourth cumulant @xmath50 , which has been tested against molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo direct simulations ( dsmc ) .",
    "it turns out that the theoretical predictions for @xmath50 are quite accurate , with a slight overestimation for @xmath50 that probably corresponds to the approximations made during the calculation ( nonlinear terms @xmath126 and higher order sonine polynomials neglected ) ; in particular @xmath50 depends only on the first moments of @xmath5 ; numerically , _",
    "the whole velocity distribution _ has the same property with a very high precision , at least for the @xmath5 studied here ( we do not exclude that this behaviour could be violated by other kinds of distributions ) .",
    "moreover , the comparison between numerical data and the second order sonine expansion shows a remarkable agreement for small values of @xmath50 .",
    "the high energy tails , studied with dsmc simulations , can be fitted by functions of the form @xmath111 , with @xmath127 depending on @xmath5 .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to have theoretical predictions concerning @xmath113 ; it seems for example that the high - energy tail is always overpopulated with respect to the maxwellian , while a particular choice of heating can also yield an under - population , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "note that once a functional form has been chosen for @xmath5 , very different tails can be observed depending on the range of variation for @xmath0 ( compare the circles and squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "this feature might question the relevance of the exponent @xmath113 as an intrinsic quantity for granular gases in steady states .",
    "an interesting issue concerns the fact that no violation of molecular chaos has been observed : md and dsmc results are in remarkable agreement ( even with a packing fraction as high as 40% in md ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation of free cooling  @xcite but also with md results on heated inelastic hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic precollisional velocity correlations driven by the standard inelastic collision rule with a constant restitution coefficient  @xcite seem significantly reduced within the present random @xmath0 model",
    ". a thorough investigation of short scale velocity correlations would require the computation of various precollisional averages involving moments of the relative velocities , and has not been performed .",
    "our results however suggest that the dynamical correlations inducing recollisions @xcite and responsible for the violation of molecular chaos may not be a generic feature of driven granular gases exhibiting a non equilibrium stationary state .",
    "more refined models could introduce correlations between the effective restitution coefficient and the relative velocities of colliding pairs .",
    "this feature , neglected here , seems difficult to quantify from first principles , but might affect the high energy tail or induce precollisional velocity correlations",
    ". it would however be very interesting to be able to link a realistic energy injection mechanism with a precise distribution of restitution coefficients .",
    "finally , a hydrodynamic study of the present random @xmath0 model , in which the conservation of the energy is valid on average only , is left for future investigations .",
    "in this appendix , we consider particular distributions @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) , and give the corresponding formulae for @xmath50 .",
