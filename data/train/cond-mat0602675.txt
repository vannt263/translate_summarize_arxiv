    "charge ordered states are common in strongly correlated materials , including especially the cuprate high temperature superconductors . identifying where such phases occur in the phase diagram , and where they occur as significant fluctuating orders",
    "is a critical step in understanding what role they play in the physics , more generally .",
    "since `` charge ordered '' refers to states which spontaneously break the spatial symmetries of the host crystal , identifying them would seem to be straightforward .",
    "however , two real - world issues make this less simple than it would seem . in the first place ,",
    "quenched disorder ( alas , an unavoidable presence in real materials ) , in all but a very few special circumstances , rounds the transition and spoils any sharp distinction between the symmetric and broken symmetry states .",
    "moreover , the charge modulations involved tend to be rather small in magnitude , and so difficult to detect _ directly _ in the obvious experiments , such as x - ray scattering .    in a previous paper ,",
    "@xcite three of us addressed at some length the issue of how the presence or absence of charge order or incipient charge order can best be established in experiment . in the present paper we focus on a related issue : in a system in which charge order is believed to exist , how can the precise character of the charge order best be established ?",
    "this is particularly timely given the spectacular developments in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) which produces extremely evocative atomic scale `` pictures '' of the local electronic structure  the question is how to extract unambiguous conclusions from the cornucopia  @xcite of data .",
    "we take as a representative example , the issue of whether the charge order that is widely observed in the cuprates is `` stripes '' ( which in addition to breaking the translation symmetry , breaks various mirror and discrete rotation symmetries of the crystal ) or `` checkerboards '' ( an order which preserves the point - group symmetries of the crystal ) . to address this issue",
    ", we generate simulated stm data and then test the utility of various measures we have developed for discriminating different types of order by applying them to this simulated data . where the correlation length for the charge order is long , definitive conclusions can be drawn relatively simply - consequently , it is possible to conclude that the preferred charge order in the 214 ( ) family of materials is stripes and not checkerboards.@xcite however , where the correlation length is short ( disorder effects are strong ) , it turns out ( unsurprisingly ) to be very difficult to develop any fool - proof way to tell whether the observed short - range order comes from pinned stripes or pinned checkerboards  for example , the image in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) corresponds to disorder - pinned stripes , despite the fact that , to the eye , the pattern is more suggestive of checkerboard order ( with the latter seen in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( right panel ) ) .    in section  [ general ] ,",
    "we give precise meaning in terms of broken symmetries to various colloquially used descriptive terms such as `` stripes , '' `` checkerboards , '' `` commensurate , '' `` incommensurate , '' `` diagonal , '' `` vertical , '' `` bond - centered , '' and `` site - centered . '' in section  [ landau ] we write an explicit landau - ginzburg ( lg ) free energy functional for stripe and checkerboard orders , including the interactions between the charge order and impurities . in section",
    "[ simulated ] we generate simulated stm data by minimizing the lg free energy in the presence of disorder .",
    "( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . )",
    "the idea is to develop strategies for solving the inverse problem : given the simulated data , how do we determine whether the `` ideal '' system , in the absence of disorder , would be stripe or checkerboard ordered , and indeed , whether it would be ordered at all or merely in a fluctuating phase with a large cdw susceptibility reflecting the proximity of an ordered state . in section",
    "[ simulated ] , we define several quantitative indicators of orientational order that are useful in this regard , but unless the correlation length is well in excess of the cdw period , no strategy we have found allows confident conclusions . in section  [ ortho ] , we show that the response of the cdw order parameter to various small symmetry breaking fields , such as a small orthorhombic distortion of the host crystal , can be used to distinguish different forms of charge order . in section  [ exp ] , we apply our quantitative indicators to a sample of stm data in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 and discuss the results . in section",

    "_ stripes _ are a form of unidirectional charge order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panel ) , characterized by modulations of the charge density at a single ordering vector , @xmath2 , and its harmonics , @xmath3 with @xmath4 an integer . in a crystal , we can distinguish different stripe states not only by the magnitude of @xmath2 , but also by whether the order is commensurate ( when @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a lattice constant and @xmath7 is the order of the commensurability ) or incommensurate with the underlying crystal , and on the basis of whether @xmath2 lies along a symmetry axis or not . in the cuprates , stripes that lie along or nearly along the cu - o bond direction are called `` vertical '' and those at roughly @xmath8 to this axis are called `` diagonal . '' in the case of commensurate order , stripes can also be classified by differing patterns of point - group symmetry breaking - for instance , the precise meaning of the often made distinction between so - called `` bond - centered '' and `` site - centered '' stripes is that they each leave different reflection planes of the underlying crystal unbroken .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that bond and site - centered stripes may be found in the same material ,  @xcite and even may coexist at the same temperature.@xcite the distinction between bond and site - centered does not exist for incommensurate stripes . if the stripes are commensurate , then @xmath2 must lie along a symmetry direction , while if the cdw is incommensurate , it sometimes will not .",
    "_ checkerboards _ are a form of charge order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) that is characterized by bi - directional charge density modulations , with a pair of ordering vectors , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where typically @xmath11 . ) checkerboard order generally preserves the point group symmetry of the underlying crystal if both ordering vectors lie along the crystal axes . in the case in which they do not , the order is rhombohedral checkerboard and the point group symmetry is not preserved . as with stripe order ,",
    "the wave vectors can be incommensurate or commensurate , and in the latter case @xmath12 .",

    "( this choice is motivated by the fact that , in many cases , the observed charge order has a period @xmath41 lattice constants . )",
    "in this section we will show how these ideas can be used to interpret stm images in terms of local stripe order . in ref . [ ] it was shown that local spectral properties of the electron green function of a correlated electron system , integrated over an energy range over a window in the physically relevant low energy regime , can be used as a measure of the local order .",
    "this is so even in cases in which the system is in a phase without long range order but close enough to a quantum phase transition ( `` fluctuating order '' ) that local defects can induce local patches of static order .",
    "from this point of view any experimentally accessible probe with the correct symmetry can be used to construct an image of the local order state . in applying the following method to real experimental data",
    ", one must take as a working assumption that the image obtained is representative of some underlying order , be it long - ranged or incipient .",
    "this analysis , of course , would not make sense if the data is not , at least in substantial part , dominated by the correlations implied by the existence of an order parameter .",
    "we generate simulated data as follows : for a given randomly chosen configuration of impurity sites , we minimize @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "this is done numerically using newton s method .",
    "the order parameter texture is then used to compute the resulting density map according to eq .",
    "this we then treat as if it were the result of a local imaging experiment , such as an stm experiment .",
    "even weak disorder has a profound effect on the results . for @xmath19 , collective pinning causes the broken symmetry state to break into domains with a characteristic size which diverges exponentially as @xmath44 ( in three dimensions , the ordered state survives as long as the disorder is less than a critical value . )",

    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where data with a given configuration of impurities with concentration @xmath45 are shown for various strengths of the potential , @xmath34 . for a checkerboard phase ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the domain structure is rather subtle , involving shifts of the phase of the density wave as a function of position as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2](left and center panels).in the stripe phase , in addition to phase disorder , there is a disordering of the orientational ( `` electron nematic '' ) order , resulting in a more visually dramatic breakup into regions of vertical and horizontal stripes , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( center panel ) .",
    "the effect of quenched disorder in the symmetric phase ( @xmath47 ) is somewhat different . in a sense ,",
    "the effect of the disorder is to pin the fluctuating order of the proximate ordered phase .",
    "however , here , whether the disorder is weak or strong , it is nearly impossible to distinguish fluctuating stripes from checkerboards .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( right panel ) illustrate this phenomenon .",
    "this is easily understood in the weak disorder limit , where @xmath48 where the susceptibility , @xmath49 is expressed in terms of the @xmath50 bessel function and is independent of @xmath21 .",
    "near criticality ( @xmath51 ) , the susceptibility is very long ranged , so a significant degree of local order can be pinned by even a rather weak impurity potential . however , only the higher order terms contain any information at all about the sign of @xmath21 , and by the time they are important , the disorder is probably already so strong that it blurs the distinction between the two states , anyway .",
    "now , our task is to answer the question : given a set of simulated data , what quantitative criteria best allows us to infer the form of the relevant correlations in the absence of disorder ?",
    "for sufficiently weak disorder , these criteria are , at best , just a way of quantifying a conclusion that is already apparent from a visual analysis of the data . where disorder is of moderate strength , such criteria may permit us to reach conclusions that are somewhat less prejudiced by our preconceived notions .",
    "of course , when the disorder is sufficiently strong that the density - wave correlation length is comparable to the cdw period , it is unlikely that any method of analysis can yield a reliable answer to this question .",
    "firstly , to eliminate the rapid spatial oscillations , we define two scalar fields ( which we will consider to be the two components of a vector field , @xmath52 ) corresponding to the components of the density which oscillate , respectively , with wave vectors near @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 where we take @xmath56 to be the coherent state with spatial extent equal to the cdw period : @xmath57\\ ] ] ( no summation over @xmath58 . )    in terms of @xmath59 we construct three quantities which can be used in interpreting data : @xmath60 \\right\\vert}^2   } { \\int { \\mbox{d}}{\\mathbf{r}}{\\left\\vert   { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_1 \\right\\vert}^2   -   { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_2 \\right\\vert}^2    \\right\\vert}^2 }   \\label{xiorien } \\\\ \\eta_{orient } & \\equiv &   \\frac{\\int { \\mbox{d}}{\\mathbf{r}}{\\left\\vert   { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_1 \\right\\vert}^2 - { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_2 \\right\\vert}^2   \\right\\vert}^2 } { \\int { \\mbox{d}}{\\mathbf{r}}{\\left\\vert   { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_1 \\right\\vert}^2 + { \\left\\vert { \\rm a}_2 \\right\\vert}^2   \\right\\vert}^2   }    \\label{horien}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantities called @xmath61 have units of length and @xmath62 is dimensionless .",

    "to summarize , the response of charge order to small amounts of orthorhombicity can be qualitatively different depending on whether the order is commensurate or incommensurate and checkerboard or striped .",
    "it is useful to point out that with complex crystal structures , the application of the above ideas requires some care .",
    "for example , there are some cuprate superconductors which exhibit a so called low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase .",
    "this phase has an effective orthorhombic distortion of each copper oxide plane , but has two planes per unit cell and a four - fold twist axis which is responsible for the fact that it is classified as tetragonal . in the first plane , @xmath107 , and in the second @xmath108 .",
    "note that this means that for stripe order , there will be four ordering vectors , a pair at @xmath109 from the first plane and a pair at @xmath110 from the other .",
    "however , for incommensurate checkerboard order , there should be _ eight _ ordering vectors : @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "there have been an extremely large number of experiments which have been performed on various closely related cuprates , both superconducting and not , which have been interpreted as evidence for or against the presence of charge order of various types .",
    "for instance , there is a large amount of quasi - periodic structure observed in the local density of states measured by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on the surface of superconducting bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 crystals , but there is controversy concerning how much of this structure arises from the interference patterns of well - defined quasiparticles whose dispersion is determined by the d - wave structure of the superconducting gap  @xcite and how much reflects the presence of charge order or incipient charge order.@xcite a similar debate has been carried out concerning the interpretation of the structures seen in inelastic neutron - scattering experiments.@xcite    as mentioned in the introduction , the issue of how to distinguish charge order from interference patterns was discussed in detail in a recent review,@xcite and so will not be analyzed here . here",
    ", we will accept as a working hypothesis the notion that various observed structures should be interpreted in terms of actual or incipient order , and focus on identifying the type of order involved .      scattering experiments in several of the cuprates , most notably , , , and o - doped have produced clear and unambiguous evidence of charge and spin ordering phenomena with a characteristic ordering vector which changes with doping.@xcite the evidence is new peaks in the static structure factor corresponding to a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry , leading to a new periodicity longer than the lattice constant of the host crystal . in many cases ,",
    "the period is near 4 lattice constants for the charge modulations and 8 lattice constants for the spin .",
    "the peak - widths correspond to a correlation length  @xcite that is often in excess of 20 periods . for technical reasons ,",
    "the spin - peaks are easier to detect experimentally , but where both are seen , the charge ordering peaks are always seen  @xcite to be aligned with the spin - ordering peaks , and the charge period is 1/2 the spin period .    except in the case  @xcite of a very lightly doped ( @xmath115 ) lsco ( where the stripes lie along an orthorhombic symmetry axis ,",
    "so only two peaks are seen ) , there are four equivalent spin - ordering peaks and , where they have been detected , four equivalent charge ordering peaks .",
    "thus , the issue arises whether this should be interpreted as the four peaks arising from some form of checkerboard order , or as two pairs of peaks arising from distinct domains of stripes - half the domains with the stripes oriented in the @xmath13 direction and half where they are oriented along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "a second issue that arises is whether the charge order is locked in to the commensurate period , 4 , or whether it is incommensurate .",
    "a variety of arguments that the scattering pattern is revealing stripe order , and not checkerboard order , were presented in the original paper by tranquada _",
    "al._@xcite ( and additionally in ref .  ) where the existence of charge order in a cuprate high temperature superconductor was first identified . here",
    ", we list a few additional arguments based on the symmetry analysis performed in the present paper , which support this initial identification : * 1 . *",
    "it follows from simple landau theory  @xcite that if there is non - spiral spin - order at wave - vectors @xmath116 , there will necessarily be charge order at wave - vectors @xmath117 .",
    "thus , if the four spin - ordering peaks come from checkerboard order , then charge - ordering peaks should be seen at wave vectors @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , while if they come from stripe domains of the two orientations , no peaks at @xmath120 should be seen .",
    "the latter situation applies to all cases in which charge ordering peaks have been seen at all .",
    "* as mentioned above , in the ltt phase , the crystal fields should cause small splittings of the ordering vectors in an incommensurate checkerboard phase , causing there to be eight essentially equivalent bragg peaks , as opposed to the four expected for domains of stripes of the two orientations .",
    "no such splittings have been detected in any of the scattering experiments on and crystals consistent with stripe domains .",
    "it should be mentioned that the fact that the ltt phase stabilizes the charge order is , by itself , a strong piece of evidence that the underlying charge order is striped . in this phase , the o octahedra are tipped in orthogonal directions in alternating planes , and the direction of the tip is along the cu - o bond direction .",
    "this permits a uniquely strong coupling between the octahedral rotation and stripe order.@xcite    a second issue , especially when the period of the charge order is near 4 lattice constants , is whether the charge order is commensurate or incommensurate .",
    "one way to determine this is from the position of the bragg peak - in the commensurate case , the structure factor should be peaked at @xmath121 ( @xmath122 for the spin order ) , and should be locked there , independent of temperature , pressure , or even doping for a finite range of doping .",
    "most of the reported peaks seen in scattering are not quite equal to the commensurate value , however . in the ltt phase of",
    ", it is believed the stripe phase is locally commensurate .",
    "the ordering wave vector is temperature independent in the ltt phase , but jumps at the ltt - lto transition and continues to change on warming .",
    "for lsco in the lto phase , the stripes might be incommensurate , however , there are only 4 peaks seen and not 8 .",
    "so it must be incommensurate stripe order and not checkerboard order.@xcite a clearer piece of evidence comes from the rotation of the ordering vector away from the cu - o bond direction in the lto phase of and o doped . in both cases",
    ", there is a small angle rotation ( less than 4@xmath123 ) seen , which moreover decreases with doping as the magnitude of the orthorhombic distortion decreases.@xcite as discussed above , this is the generic behavior expected of incommensurate order , and is incompatible with commensurate order .",
    "the strongest quasiperiodic modulations seen in stm are those reported by hanaguri _ et .",
    "@xcite on the surface of naccoc , which have a period which appears to be commensurate , @xmath124 .",
    "this observation has been interpreted as evidence that naccoc is charge - ordered with a checkerboard pattern ( at least at the surface.@xcite ) however , the correlation length deduced for the checkerboard order is only about two periods of the order .",
    "indeed , the domain structure in the stm data looks to the eye very much like the pictures in our figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) and  [ fig2 ] ( right panel ) .",

    "* 2 : * that the nearby ordered state could be either a striped or a checkerboard state .",
    "we hope , in the near future , to apply the more quantitative analysis proposed in the present paper to this data .    _ concerning the modulations seen in stm studies on bscco _ : given the recent interest in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , we report a preliminary application of our analysis to data from a near optimally doped sample , with an image size 21 cdw wavelengths across . fig .",

    "( though there should probably be a fair amount of quasiparticle scattering at a nearby wave vector , it should be four - fold symmetric , so should not affect either @xmath80 or @xmath62 . ) the fact that the orientational correlation length exceeds the cdw correlation length is suggestive that the proximate ordered state is a stripe ordered state and the ratio @xmath134 is interesting , as it exceeds our ( disorder - averaged ) result of 1/2 for the symmetric phase ( @xmath47 ) .",

    "there are many circumstances in which charge order plays a significant role in the physics of electronically interesting materials . depending on the situation",
    ", different aspects of the physics may be responsible for the choice of the characteristic period of the charge order ; for instance , it can be determined by fermi surface nesting ( as in a peierls transition ) , by a small deviation from a commensurate electron density ( which fixes a concentration of discommensurations ) , or by some form of coulomb frustrated phase separation .",
    "working backwards , measurements of the period of the charge order as a function of parameters ( temperature , pressure , doping ,  ) can shed light on the mechanism of charge ordering .",
    "the physics that determines the ultimate pattern of charge order is still more subtle .",
    "for instance , for adsorbates on graphite , the sign of the energy of intersection determines whether the discommensurations form a striped or honeycomb arrangement .",

    "conversely , the coulomb repulsion between dilute doped holes , or between dilute cooper pairs favor a more isotropic ( wigner crystalline ) arrangement of charges with more of a checkerboard structure.@xcite thus , resolving the nature of the preferred structure of the charge ordered states in the cuprates , at the least , teaches us something about the mechanism of charge ordering in these materials .    on the basis of our present analysis",
    ", we feel that there is compelling evidence that most , and possibly all , of the charge order and incipient charge order seen in hole - doped cuprates is preferentially striped .",
