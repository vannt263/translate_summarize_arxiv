    "polarized electron scattering has a long and illustrious history that began with the celebrated slac polarized @xmath3 scattering  @xcite , which was instrumental in putting the sandard model ( sm ) on a firm experimental ground .",
    "the latest experiment of this class is the polarized mller scattering .",
    "as only the electrons are involved , theory calculations at quantum loop levels can be performed free of hadronic uncertainties making it an ideal process for precision sm testing ; any deviation from expectations will also be a clear signal of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "a while ago , an experiment of this type has been successfully completed  @xcite , where parity - violating measurements have been made from the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons  either left - handed ( lh ) or right - handed ( rh )  on an unpolarized electron target . at a momentum transfer of @xmath4  gev@xmath5 , the left - right asymmetry @xmath6 has been measured to an accuracy of approximately 20  ppb , and the weak angle determined to be @xmath7 , with its running established at the @xmath8 level . in the sm , @xmath9 arises from the interference between the electromagnetic and the weak neutral currents , and is given by @xmath10 \\",

    "the electroweak corrections matching this experimental accuracy and more is given in ref .",
    "the value of the weak angle at @xmath15 is found to be @xmath16 in an updated analysis  @xcite .",
    "we use this value in all our numerical calculations below .",
    "recently , a 12  gev energy upgrade to the intense electron facility at jlab has been approved .",
    "this raises the possibility of measuring @xmath9 to an accuracy of 1  ppb .",
    "since the theoretical uncertainty can in principle be calculated to this accuracy , a successful measurement will be sensitive to the new physics at the several tev scale , which is also the physics landscape to be explored by the lhc .",
    "also recently , an anomalous abundance of positron flux in cosmic radiation has been reported by the pamela collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this confirms the excess previously observed by the heat  @xcite and ams  @xcite experiments .",
    "the atic  @xcite and ppb - bets  @xcite balloon experiments have also recorded similar excess .",
    "one possible origin is from a hidden sector and low scale dark matter annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the hidden sector scale is @xmath17(gev ) , and so is at the opposite end of the new heavy physics .",
    "the characteristic of this class of model is that possible couplings to sm matter fields must be extremely weak .",
    "a very simple model was constructed previously to study this possibility  @xcite , and mller scattering was found to give very stringent constraints .    motivated by all these encouraging developments , we examine in detail how an improved @xmath9 measurement could shed light on new physics .",
    "we focus here on classes of non - superymmetric new physics and how they might manifest themselves in precision polarized mller scattering .",
    "it is well known that @xmath9 can be used to probe the existence of doubly charged scalars and extra @xmath0 bosons .",
    "the doubly charged scalars are interesting in their own right , and they also arise in type ii seesaw models for neutrino masses  @xcite . for extra @xmath0 bosons ,",
    "the literature is particularly rich with well motivated models .",
    "these include models of grand unified theory ( gut ) based on the @xmath18 or @xmath19 gauge group  @xcite , hidden sector @xmath0 models  @xcite , and left - right symmetric  @xcite and warped extra - dimensional randall - sundrum ( rs )  @xcite models based on the gauge group @xmath20 .",
    "the effects of a new particle such as the doubly charged scalar of the extra @xmath0 boson can be encoded in an effective operator approach , which for @xmath9 involve only two dimension six operators : @xmath21 in the next section , we describe this effective operator approach .",

    "the wilson coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by specific models at @xmath23 .",
    "one has to do a renormalization group ( rg ) running analysis to determine their values at the relevant low energy scale where the experiments are performed .",
    "the rg equations for these coefficients can be found in ref .",
    "numerically , we find that the rg running effects are not significant .",
    "they give about a @xmath34 effect running between @xmath23 ( typically a few tev ) and @xmath24 , and hence can be neglected in the first approximation . below @xmath24 the running is governed by the well known @xmath35 funtions . including them leads to a change of about @xmath36 in the values of the coefficients between @xmath23 and @xmath37 gev .",

    "the effective operators , @xmath47 , can arise from numerous new physics models , and those coming from the tree - level exchange of virtual particles are the most important .",

    "we remark here that the new physics effects in mller scattering can also come in through the @xmath48 coupling being modified .",
    "this is particularly evident in cases when the heavy states of the new physics also have very small couplings to electrons so that the virtual exchange process is suppressed both by the propagator effect and the small coupling .",

    "note that the ll - type contribution is always greater that of the rr - type .",

    "if a doubly charged scalar were discovered at the lhc , a measurement of the @xmath111 will determine its yukawa couplings to electrons , and the sign of @xmath111 will determine whether it couples to lh or rh electrons ( negative for the former , positive for the latter ) .",
