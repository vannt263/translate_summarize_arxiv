    "the standard textbook approach to the insulating state of matter is based on band theory . following bloch s theorem @xcite in 1928 , the main result is due to wilson in 1931 @xcite .",
    "the single - particle spectrum of a lattice - periodical hamiltonian is in general gapped , and the electron count determines where the fermi level lies .",
    "if it crosses a band one has a conductor : an applied electric field induces free acceleration of the electrons ( at @xmath0 in absence of dissipation ) .",
    "if the fermi level lies instead in a gap , one has an insulator : in presence of a field the electronic system polarizes , but no steady - state current flows for @xmath1 .",
    "this very successful theory explains the insulating / conducting behavior of most common materials across the periodic table , for which band structure calculations became soon available .    at the root of band theory",
    "are two basic assumptions : the electrons are noninteracting ( in a mean - field sense ) , and the solid is crystalline . by the early 1960s ,",
    "however , it became clear that there are solids where these two assumptions are very far from the truth , and where the insulating behaviour is due to completely different mechanisms .",
    "the works of mott in 1949 @xcite and of anderson in 1958 @xcite opened new avenues in condensed matter physics . in the materials which we now call mott insulators",
    "the insulating behaviour is due to electron correlation @xcite , while in those called anderson insulators it is due to lattice disorder @xcite .    in a milestone paper appeared in 1964",
    "kohn @xcite provided a more comprehensive characterization of the insulating state of matter , which encompasses band insulators , mott insulators , anderson insulators , and eventually any kind of insulating material . according to kohn ,",
    "the electrons in the insulating state satisfy a many - electron localization condition @xcite . this kind of localization must be defined in a subtle way given that , for instance , the hamiltonian eigenstates in a band insulator are obviously _ not _ localized . according to the original kohn s formulation ,",
    "the insulating behaviour arises whenever the ground - state wavefunction of an extended system breaks up into a sum of contributions which are localized in essentially disconnected regions of the many - electron configuration space .",
    "kohn s theory remained little visited for many years @xcite until the 1990s , when a breakthrough occurred in electronic structure theory : the modern theory of polarization ( for historical presentations , see e.g refs .",
    "@xcite ) . inspired by the fact that electrical polarization discriminates _ qualitatively _ between insulators and metals , resta and sorella @xcite in 1999 provided a definition of many - electron localization rather different from kohn s , and deeply rooted in the theory of polarization .",
    "their program was completed soon after by souza , wilkens and martin @xcite ( hereafter quoted as swm ) , thus providing the foundations of the modern theory of the insulating state .",
    "an early review paper appeared in 2002 @xcite .",
    "several advances occurred afterwards , and the present review illustrates most of them .",
    "but the major aim of this work is to provide a thorough formulation of the modern theory of the insulating state by means of geometrical concepts , which remained somewhat hidden and implicit in the original literature .",
    "while the theory of polarization is based on a berry phase , the theory of the insulating state as presented here is rooted in quantum distance and metric ; most of the results previous published in different form will be revisited emphasizing their geometrical content .",
    "let us assume that a generic time - independent quantum hamiltonian has a parametric dependence .",

    "we start discussing the most general case , and therefore for the time being we do not specify which quantum system is described by this hamiltonian , nor what the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath4 is . later on , @xmath6 will be identified with a many - electron wavefunction .",
    "the state vectors @xmath6 are all supposed to be normalized and to reside in the same hilbert space : this amounts to saying that the wavefunctions are supposed to obey @xmath4-independent boundary conditions .",
    "we focus on the ground state @xmath7 , and we assume it to be nondegenerate for @xmath4 in some domain of @xmath5 .    any quantum mechanical state vector is arbitrary by a constant phase factor . here",
    "we refer to choosing this phase as to the choice of the gauge .",
    "all measurable quantities ( e.g. expectation values ) are obviously gauge - invariant , but the reverse is also true : all gauge - invariant properties are  at least in principle  measurable .",
    "it is expedient to define the ground - state projector ( a.k.a .",
    "density matrix ) and its complement , i.e. @xmath8 both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are obviously gauge - invariant .",

    "( [ pancha1 ] ) and ( [ pancha2 ] ) provide a @xmath15 which is unique modulo @xmath16 , except in the very special case that the states are orthogonal .",
    "however , it is also clear that such @xmath15 is gauge - dependent and _ can not _ have , by itself , any physical meaning .",
    "the distance between quantum states has been defined by bures @xcite as : @xmath17 such distance fulfills the familiar axioms from calculus textbooks ; it vanishes when the two states physically coincide ( i.e. independently of the phase factor ) , and is maximum ( equal to one ) when the states are orthogonal . at variance with @xmath15 defined above , the bures distance is gauge - invariant , and can be explicitly expressed in terms of ground - state projectors @xmath18 where `` tr '' is the trace over the hilbert space .",
    "we have already observed that the phase difference @xmath15 between any two states is gauge - dependent and can not have any physical meaning .",

    "since the static longitudinal conductivity vanishes , the system is by definition insulating : this is why we speak of `` qh insulators '' .",
    "we are going to show that electron localization  as defined in the modern theory of the insulating state  is the common _ cause _ for both the vanishing of the dc longitudinal conductivity and the quantization of the transverse one . therefore to predict whether the dc transverse conductivity is quantized ,",
    "it is enough to inspect electron localization in the ground state .",
    "this outstanding result was proved in 2005 @xcite .",
    "our system is a square of size @xmath221 , where the presence of a macroscopic @xmath222 field _ forbids _ simple pbcs ; this , however , is no serious problem .",
    "we choose the landau gauge for the magnetic vector potential in eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) , and we impose the magnetic boundary conditions which are customary in the qh literature @xcite ; this requires the total flux @xmath223 to be an integer times @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the flux quantum .        when switching from 3d to 2d , many of the above formulae require obvious modifications . for an isotropic system , the 2d analogue of eqs .",
    "( [ swm1 ] ) and ( [ swm2 ] ) can be written as _ 0^ _ 11 ( ) & = & _ c , [ sum1 ] + _ 12(0 ) & = & _ c .",
    "[ sum2 ] a glance at the sum - over - states expression for @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ pertu4 ] ) , shows that whenever @xmath226 converges , then @xmath227 converges as well .",
    "however , we are going to show that the latter may only converge to quantized values in the present 2d case .",
    "by definition we have @xmath228 in the large-@xmath69 limit , we may write & & + & = & ( ) ^2 _ 0^ d _ 1 _ 0^ d _ 2 .",
    "the dimensionless integral is over a closed surface ( a torus ) , given the magnetic boundary conditions .",
    "it is therefore equal to @xmath229 , where @xmath42 is the chern number of the first class ( sect .",
    "[ sec : chern ] ) ; hence @xmath230 and the transverse conductivity , eq .",
    "( [ sum2 ] ) becomes @xmath231 we have thus arrived at the famous niu - thouless - wu formula @xcite which holds for both the integer and fractional qh effect .",
    "the original derivation was based on an analysis of the green function , under the hypothesis that the system has a fermi gap ; in the present derivation the presence of a fermi gap becomes apparently irrelevant , since the localization tensor is a pure _ ground - state _ property . underlying the modern theory of the insulating state , however , is a fluctuation - dissipation theorem , relating the ground state to the excitations of the system .",
    "the main message of ref . @xcite ( and of the present section ) can be summarized by saying that _ any _ 2d insulator displays a quantized transverse conductance ( nonvanishing only in absence of time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "an electron fluid is kept in the qh regime by disorder , and analytical implementations of the present formulae are obviously not possible .",
    "nonetheless , in order to illustrate how the theory works , it is expedient to consider the academic case of noninteracting electrons in a flat substrate potential .",
    "if the first landau level is fully occupied ( i.e. at filling @xmath232 ) the electron density is uniform and equal to @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the magnetic length ; the modulus of the density matrix has the simple expression ( for single occupancy ) @xmath235 and the cumulant second moment is clearly finite .",
    "the trace @xmath236 of the localization tensor is in fact equal to @xmath237 , the squared magnetic length .",
    "if the filling is fractional the density can not be uniform ( for noninteracting electrons ) , and , more important , the cumulant second moment diverges ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) : the system is not insulating , and its transverse conductivity is not quantized .",
    "the qh state of matter , discovered in 1980 and addressed in the previous section , provides the first example of a quantum state which is topologically distinct from all previously known states of matter .",
    "this is the reason why its macroscopic quantization properties are very robust ( `` topologically protected '' ) , and insensitive to small changes in material parameters .",
    "the debut of geometrical concepts in electronic structure theory dates from two milestone papers : tknn in 1982 @xcite and niu - thouless - wu in 1985 @xcite .",
    "these papers addressed a 2d electron fluid ( noninteracting and interacting , respectively ) in the presence of a macroscopic magnetic field : the hamiltonian , therefore , can not be lattice periodical .    a subsequent breakthrough on the theory side",
    "is the haldane model hamiltonian  @xcite : this can be considered as the precursor of modern topological insulators @xcite .",
    "its trademark is quantized hall conductance in absence of a macroscopic magnetic field .",
    "the model is comprised of a 2d honeycomb lattice with two tight - binding sites per primitive cell with site energies @xmath238 , real first - neighbor hopping @xmath239 , and complex second - neighbor hopping @xmath240 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : haldane ] . within this two - band model ,",
    "one deals with insulators by taking the lowest band as occupied .",
    "the appeal of the model is that the vector potential and the hamiltonian are lattice periodical and the single - particle orbitals always have the usual bloch form .",
    "essentially , the microscopic magnetic field can be thought as staggered ( i.e. up and down in different regions of the cell ) , but its cell average vanishes .",
    "for a 2d lattice - periodical hamiltonian the chern number @xmath42 has been defined before , eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) . as a function of the flux parameter @xmath241",
    ", this system undergoes a transition from a normal insulator ( @xmath242 ) to chern insulator ( @xmath243 ) .    like in the qh case discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : qh ] : ( i ) the imaginary part of the localization tensor is related to the chern number by eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) ; and ( ii ) the trace of the localization tensor is finite .",
    "this is confirmed by the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the actual value of @xmath185 , eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) , is computed .",
    "we remind that , despite @xmath185 being finite , localized wannier functions ( with finite quadratic spread ) do not exist in chern insulators .",
    "the haldane model insulator and the qh insulator both display quantized transverse conductivity , and both are localized in the sense of the modern theory of the insulating state .",
    "it is worth pointing out , though , that the decay of the density matrix is qualitatively different : exponential in the haldane case @xcite vs. gaussian in the ( noninteracting ) qh case , eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "( @xmath244 ) .",
    "solid lines connecting nearest neighbors indicate a real hopping amplitude @xmath239 ; dashed arrows pointing to a second - neighbor site indicates a complex hopping amplitude @xmath245 .",
    "arrows indicate sign of the phase @xmath241 for second - neighbor hopping .",
    ", width=264 ]    no microscopic realization of a chern insulator ( in absence of a macroscopic magnetic field ) is known to date .",
    "a _ mesoscopic _ chern insulator , in the same spirit as the haldane model , was synthesized in 2008 @xcite .",
    "chern insulators remained a curiosity of academic interest only for many years . in 2005",
    "it was realized that the haldane model is the forebear of a completely new class of insulators , called `` topological insulators '' @xcite .",
    "although chern insulators do not exist in nature , a different kind of topological insulators _ does exist _ in nature in both 2d and 3d @xcite ; their macroscopic quantization properties are topologically protected , and insensitive to small changes in material parameters , exactly like in the qh case .",
    "modern topological insulators are characterized by novel invariants called @xmath246  ( close relatives of the chern number in 2d and of the chern invariant in 3d ) .",
    "the paradigmatic @xmath246  topological insulator is the kane - mele model hamiltonian in 2d @xcite .",
    "most important , at variance with chern insulators , the modern topological insulators are time - reversal symmetric .",
    "since spin - orbit interaction plays a major role , the definition of localization tensor needs to be augmented to explicitly include the spin coordinates ; this seems to be rather straightforward , and is deferred to further publications .",
    "after this is done , the scope of the modern theory of the insulating state would include topological insulators .",
    "obviously , no investigation of this kind exists yet .",
    "nonetheless , a closely related investigation concerning the wannier functions in a @xmath246  insulator is appearing these days @xcite .",
    "the results confirm that the ground state of a topological insulator is localized in the sense of the modern theory of the insulating state : @xmath185 , eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) , is in fact finite . furthermore  at variance with the chern - insulator case",
    " localized wannier functions ( with finite quadratic spread ) do exist , although a generalization of the marzari - vanderbilt theory @xcite is needed .",
    "according to the milestone 1964 kohn s paper @xcite , the organization of the electrons in their _ ground state _ is qualitatively different in insulators and metals .",
    "this paper provided the foundations of the `` theory of the insulating state '' .",
    "the modern developments of the theory started many years later ( 1999 ) with the work of resta and sorella @xcite , and continue to these days .    here",
    "we provide a comprehensive presentation of the modern theory . in so doing , we emphasize the geometrical properties of the many - body wavefunction , which were somewhat hidden in most of the original literature .",
    "we focus on the linear response of the many - body wavefunction to an infinitesimal `` twist '' ( or `` flux '' ) in the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "this is the ground - state property which discriminates insulators from metals .",
    "the distance between the ( infinitesimally ) twisted and untwisted ground states , measured by the quantum metric tensor in the thermodynamic limit , is finite in insulators and divergent in metals .",
    "technically , in our formulation the twist has the dimensions of an inverse length ; the quantum metric tensor has therefore the dimensions of a squared length and is extensive .",
    "the key intensive quantity is the metric tensor _ per electron _ ; this is generally called `` localization tensor '' or `` second cumulant moment '' of the electron distribution .",
    "it is a global property of the electronic ground state , apparently unrelated to the system excitations . in some cases ( discussed above )",
    "the localization tensor is naturally endowed with an imaginary antisymmetric part , whose physical meaning is also outstanding .",
    "the modern theory of the insulating state encompasses all kinds of known insulators .",
    "here we discuss , using uniform concepts and notations , the most diverse cases : open and periodic boundary conditions ; interacting and noninteracting electrons , crystalline and disordered systems ; time - reversal symmetry present and absent .",
    "we even briefly comment on topological insulators ."
