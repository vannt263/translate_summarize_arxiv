    "checkerboard embeddings are exactly those embeddings whose first @xmath1-homology class is zero .    in @xcite the second named author ( v.o.m . ) gave a solution to the question of whether four - valent framed graphs are planar . in @xcite , he addressed the question of determining the genus of surfaces into which four - valent framed graphs can be embedded , in particular considering the special case of surfaces into which four - valent framed graphs may be checkerboard - embedded . in @xcite , the first named author ( t.f . )",

    "we continue the project of generalizing results about embeddability properties of framed four - valent graphs to @xmath0-graphs with each vertex of degree 4 or 6 , now considering checkerboard - embeddability into nonorientable surfaces . in theorem [ main ] we show that this is equivalent to a problem on matrices .",

    "we show that this is equivalent to a problem on matrices . to accomplish this",
    ", we fix a cycle @xmath6 in @xmath2 satisfying certain properties , called a rotating - splitting cycle .",

    "this embedding induces a @xmath0-structure on the skeleton .",
    "the @xmath0-structure at each vertex determines a set of @xmath8 angles among which we say that two angles are adjacent if they share a half - edge .",
