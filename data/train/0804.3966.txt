    "the detailed distribution of stars in galaxies gives vital information regarding their formation and subsequent evolution .",
    "of particular interest are the oldest stellar populations , which in the milky way are the thick disk and halo .",
    "these old components provide the best record of early galaxy assembly .",
    "originally detected in edge - on s0 galaxies @xcite , thick stellar disks have now been found in a wide variety of galaxies ",
    "s0 s @xcite , sb s @xcite , and later type galaxies @xcite .",
    "observations with hst have allowed thick disks in other galaxies to be studied as resolved population @xcite , while observations at high redshift show potential thick disks in the process of forming @xcite .",
    "the most detailed studies of thick disks come from observations within the milky way .",
    "since its discovery @xcite , the mw thick disk has been found to be structurally , chemically , and kinematically distinct from the thin disk .",
    "structurally , star counts with large surveys such as sdss and 2mass reveal the galaxy is best fit with two disk components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "chemically , thick disk stars are more metal - poor and older than stars in the thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are also significantly enhanced in @xmath0-elements , compared to thin disk stars of comparable iron abundance @xcite .",
    "kinematically , thick disk stars have both a larger velocity dispersion and slower net rotation than stars in the thin disk @xcite .",
    "all of these facts lead to the conclusion that the thick disk is a relic of the young galaxy . as such",
    ", it provides an excellent probe of models of disk galaxy formation ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "given these systematic differences between their properties , thick and thin disks are likely to have distinct formation mechanisms .",
    "the structure , dynamics , and chemical abundance of the thin disk strongly suggest that the majority of its stars formed gradually from a thin rotating disk of high angular momentum gas @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the formation of the thick disk is still poorly constrained and is likely to be more complex .",
    "thick disk formation models can be grouped into three broad categories . in the first ,",
    "a previously thin disk is kinematic heated . in this scenario ,",
    "stars form in a thin disk and increase their velocity dispersion with time .",
    "this vertical heating can be rapid , due to interactions and mergers @xcite or gradual , due to scattering off giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , and/or dark matter substructure @xcite . in the second formation scenario , stars `` form thick '' with star formation occurring above the midplane of the galaxy @xcite or form with large initial velocity dispersions in large stellar clusters @xcite . in the final class of models , thick disk stars",
    "are directly accreted from satellite galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that stars in disrupted satellite galaxies can be deposited onto thick disk like orbits @xcite , producing extended stellar debris such as seen around m31 @xcite .",
    "while these models were originally developed to explain the origin of the mw thick disk , they should work equally well for thick disks in other galaxies .",
    "measuring the kinematics of thick disk stars is one of the best discriminators between the formation models . if the thick disk forms from a heated thin disk , we expect the kinematics of the two components to be closely related . on the other hand ,",
    "if the thick disk stars form outside the galaxy and are later accreted , we could find systems where the thick disk kinematics are completely decoupled from the thin disk .    in this paper ,",
    "we present observations of stellar and gas kinematics in nine edge - on systems as part of our continuing analysis of thick disks in a large sample of edge - on galaxies @xcite . compared to @xcite , which presented the first two galaxies in this study ,",
    "we have improved the analysis techniques and significantly expanded our sample size .",
    "we have carried out long - slit spectroscopic observations using the gemini north and south telescopes of nine galaxies drawn from the @xcite sample of edge - on late - type galaxies .",
    "the original sample of 49 galaxies was selected from the flat galaxy catalog @xcite and imaged in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this sample was selected to contain undisturbed pure disk systems spanning a large range of mass . @xcite",
    "used this imaging to demonstrate the ubiquity of thick disks around late - type galaxies , while @xcite used two - dimensional photometric decompositions to measure the structural parameters for the thick and thin disks .",
    "all the galaxies in the sample presented here have prominent thin star forming disks .",
    "our spectroscopic program targeted galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the sample targets were limited to those that had thick disks that we believed we could isolate adequately  i.e . ,",
    "those that had significantly larger scale heights from the thin disk and that were bright enough that we could acquire spectra in reasonable observing times .",
    "this constraint caused several of the higher mass galaxies to be rejected from the kinematic sample , as the regions where the thick disk could be expected to dominate were simply too faint .",
    "this bias is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite that the thick disk is more prevalent in lower mass galaxies .",
    "our selection criterion limited the sample to @xmath620 galaxies of the original 49 .",
    "we also selected galaxies to be at redshifts such that the ca features did not land on night sky emission lines . in our initial observations",
    ", we submitted more galaxies than we could observe and let the gemini observing specialists select which galaxies would best fit with the queue scheduling .",
    "for the final observing runs we explicitly selected galaxies to ensure that a reasonable mass range was observed in the final sample .",
    "the properties of the final sample are listed in table  [ gal_list ] .",
    "based on the thin and thick disk decompositions in @xcite , we targeted regions of the galaxies where the flux is dominated by either the thin or thick disk stars .",
    "the two highest mass galaxies in our sample have notable dustlanes @xcite , and for these we offset the spectra slit to observe regions of the galaxy which should be optically transparent .",
    "we discuss possible residual dust effects in detail in   [ sdust ] .",
    "when selecting slit placement for the offplane , the direction of offset was based primarily on avoiding foreground objects and the ability to use a single guide star for all dither positions .    for our instrumental setup , we used gmos on gemini north in longslit mode with a 0.5  slit and the r400_g5305 grating set to a central wavelength of @xmath7   along with the og515_g0306 filter .",
    "similarly for observations from gemini south , we used a 0.5  slit the r400+_g5325 grating and og515_g0330 filter .",
    "for both gmos setups , we binned the ccds by 2 in the spatial direction during readout giving a pixel scale of 0.145/pix in the spatial direction and 0.69  / pixel in the spectral direction .",
    "the resulting spectra cover the wavelength range of @xmath8  , although there is heavy residual fringing redward of 9300  .",
    "exposure times for individual frames were 900 , 1200 , or 1800 seconds .",
    "the midplanes were observed 3 - 5 times while offplane positions were observed 18 - 51 times depending on the galaxy .",
    "exposures were spatially dithered @xmath630  along the slit .",
    "these configurations allow us to simultaneously observe the h@xmath0 emission and ca ii triplet absorption features out to large radii .",
    "all of the observations were executed in queue mode over five semesters .",

    "we bias corrected the images using a fit determined from the overscan region followed by subtracting residual structure measured from a bias frame . because both gmos north and south are extremely stable , we were able to create average bias images by combining @xmath660 bias frames per observing semester .",
    "we interpolated the three gmos chips into a single image using the gemini iraf tasks , after which the standard iraf reduction tools were used . for gemini - south observations",

    "gemini - north images showed no detectable dark current .",
    "images were flat - fielded using gcal lamp flats that were taken every hour interspersed with the science observations , minimizing the amount of fringing present in the final frames .",
    "we applied a slit illumination correction using twilight sky observations .    for wavelength calibration",
    ", we used the night - sky atlases of @xcite and @xcite to create a sky line list containing only lines ( or stable unresolved doublets ) that could be centroided with our instrumental set - up .",
    "for each science exposure , we identified 100 - 110 sky lines to use for rectification .",
    "we then used these lines for a 5th order legendre polynomial fit for wavelength calibration , and rebinned our spectra to a common dispersion .",
    "typical dispersions were 0.69   pixel@xmath5 with calibration arc lamps showing a fwhm of 3.8  .",
    "the wavelength solutions were stable over each observing night .",
    "sky subtraction proved difficult because of the large number of strong sky emission lines .",
    "if we use standard sky subtraction techniques , we find that there are large systematic residuals left on our frames due to variation in the width of the slit along its length .",
    "the rms deviation in the centroid position of a single sky line is @xmath60.07   while the rms of its gaussian fwhm is 0.11  .",
    "this is a surprisingly high variation for the width of the slit .",
    "we have tried the sky - subtraction techniques described in @xcite and find that the systematic residuals remain , although the @xcite sky - subtraction technique does eliminate problems associated with wavelength rectification and interpolation .",
    "having eliminated our data - reduction procedure as the cause , we conclude the high dispersion in sky line fwhm is indicative of a systematically varying slit width . in many cases ,",
    "such residuals can be removed using the nod - and - shuffle technique @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our galaxies are too large ( @xmath61 arc minute , or 1/3 of the total slit width ) to make effective use of traditional nod - and - shuffle .    to remove the systematic residuals present in the bright sky lines , we employ a nod - and - shuffle like template subtraction .",
    "because we placed different galaxies on different spatial sections of the chips , all of the slit was illuminated by sky for at least some observations .",
    "we therefore could construct high s / n sky frames by masking objects in our 2-d spectra and combining the wavelength rectified frames . by doing this , we create a deep sky frame for each observing quarter .",
    "we then remove the sky background by selecting a sky - dominated region in a science frame and scaling the sky image column - by - column to match the science frame sky region , then subtract the rescaled sky frame from the science image . in most cases ,",
    "we were forced to apply sky frames generated from different observing semesters to the science frames .",
    "luckily , our instrument setup quarter - to - quarter was identical , and the gmos instruments are stable enough that this technique works well at removing systematics caused by the variable slit width .",
    "this sky subtraction technique appears to give results comparable to nod - and - shuffle technique for individual frames .",
    "our sky subtraction procedure incurs a small signal - to - noise penalty , but is effective at removing the systematic residuals from moderate sky lines ( figure  [ sky_sub ] ) .",
    "this excessive agonizing over sky subtraction is demanded by the very low surface brightness levels of our targets .",
    "for an individual midplane image , the brightest part of the galaxy is @xmath11 brighter than the sky level , and for individual offplane images the signal is only @xmath12 the sky background .",
    "examples of the spectra extracted over the central 14  spatial extent of the galaxy before and after sky subtraction are shown in figure  [ sky_level ] .",
    "when we combine several hours of observations we are more sensitive to low surface brightness features , and find some wavelengths are still dominated by systematic noise .",
    "even with our sky template correction , some sky lines are so bright that some systematic residuals remain .",
    "when we use conventional sky - subtraction techniques , residual errors have maximum deviations of @xmath1355% while the template subtraction gives deviations of @xmath1338% .",
    "while deviations of 38% swamp out the signal from any stellar absorption lines near bright sky lines , the residual deviations for smaller sky lines are decreased to a level where the stellar absorption lines can be accurately measured . in figure",
    "[ sky_sub ] , we compare the two sky subtraction routines . the extracted spectra look similar , with both being dominated by the sky line residuals redward of 8750  .",
    "the template subtraction is able to eliminate the residuals left from the sky line at 8555  , just to the right of the weakest ca ii triplet line , and reduces the large residuals at the reddest wavelengths plotted .",
    "after the sky had been removed , the images were doppler - corrected for motion relative to the local standard of rest and combined . before cross - correlation",
    "was performed , the spectra were rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins .",
    "both our midplane and offplane observations show strong h@xmath0 emission . for each galaxy , we extracted a series of 1-d spectra by summing 28 pixels ( @xmath14 ) along the spatial dimension .",
    "the ionized gas rotation curve was fit with a gaussian peak to the h@xmath0 line . in principle",
    ", an envelope - tracing method would produce a more robust measure of the rotation curve .",
    "however , we find that the width of the h@xmath0 lines ( fwhm@xmath63.8  ) are identical to the instrumental dispersion as measured from the arc lamps ( fwhm@xmath63.8  ) , and we would thus not gain much accuracy from a more detailed rotation curve extraction .",
    "the [ nii ] and [ sii ] lines are present as well , but the h@xmath0 line is so strong that we found no additional advantage in fitting all the emission lines simultaneously .",
    "we find typical uncertainties in the central wavelength of the h@xmath0 gaussian peak of 1 - 2 km s@xmath5  for midplane observations and 4 - 7",
    "km s@xmath5  for offplane observations .    to double check the accuracy of our extracted rotation curve , we fit rotation curves to night sky lines before the background is subtracted off",
    ". perfect calibration would result in sky line rotation curves with zero rotation .",
    "the central wavelengths of the sky lines vary with an rms error of 2.4 - 3.5 km s@xmath5 , with the higher value resulting from larger spatial extraction windows .",
    "most of this scatter can be attributed to uncertainties in the wavelength rectification solution . with fewer sky lines around h@xmath0 compared to the redder regions of our spectra , the rectification is not as well constrained .",
    "overall , these tests suggest that we are able to extract the ionized gas rotation curve with an error of a few km s@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting h@xmath0 rotation curves are plotted as solid lines in figure  [ all_rc ] .",
    "our data show a tight agreement between the midplane and offplane h@xmath0 curves , which is a good sign that dust is not obscuring the midplane rotation curves .",
    "if we were observing along major dustlanes , we could expect to see the offplane observations rotating faster than the midplane , especially at small galactic radii ( see   [ sdust ] ) .",
    "we leave a detailed analysis of the gas kinematics for a later paper . at this time",
    ", we simply note that the midplane and offplane h@xmath0 rotation curves are surprisingly well matched .",
    "this is slightly unexpected , as several recent studies have found extended gaseous halos of edge - on galaxies to be lagging in rotational speed when compared to the midplane gas @xcite .",
    "these offplane lags have been detected in both the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) and hi .",
    "there is some difficulty in comparing our measurements of longslit rotation curves to other detailed measurements of offplane gas which typically utilize 2-d information from radio @xcite , integral field units @xcite , and fabry - perot spectra @xcite all of which detect gas at larger scale - heights than those probed with our offplane measurements .",
    "the other major difference between these previous studies and our offplane rotation curves is that we have targeted lower mass galaxies .",
    "the studies cited above target galaxies with @xmath15 km s@xmath5  while the sample studied here extends to galaxies with rotation speeds of less than 60 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the gaseous lags observed in other systems are usually modeled with either a galactic fountain that ejects gas to large scale - heights or with a gas infall model where galaxies slowly accrete rotating gas .",
    "the lack of significant lags in our h@xmath0 rotation curves could simply be a sign that these galaxies are not as active in forming galactic fountains or accreting gas as the more massive galaxies .      to derive absorption line rotation curves , we require higher signal - to - noise than for the @xmath16  rotation curve .",
    "we therefore sum the 2d spectra in the spatial direction until the 1d spectra reaches an adequate s / n ( @xmath17 per spectral pixel ) .",
    "the resulting bins have variable widths across the face of the galaxy , but roughly comparable s / n per bin . for the central regions of the galaxies",
    "the bin size is around 10  while the outer regions and offplane components have bin sizes @xmath18 .",
    "these bins correspond to @xmath63 - 6 kpc at the typical distances of the galaxies . for reference ,",
    "the typical exponential disk radial scale lengths are @xmath19 .    extracting kinematic information from this data required developing a new procedure . in @xcite",
    ", we tried both direct @xmath20-fitting of a template spectrum as well as cross - correlation of the galaxy with a stellar template to measure the stellar rotation and line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( losvd ) .",
    "we have since concluded that these traditional methods are not optimal for our data .",
    "direct fitting of a template star results in the template being over - broadened ( i.e. , the fitted losvd diverges to large values ) .",
    "this can be understood as the template star fitting the continuum region of the galaxy spectrum at the expense of a small portion of the absorption line . because the normalized continuum is very low s / n , it is best fit by a straight line , which is equivalent to a stellar spectrum which has been smoothed by a very broad filter . in @xcite",
    "we were forced to hold the velocity dispersion fixed during the @xmath20 minimization to prevent this problem .",
    "cross - correlation is also problematic , as the bright sky lines leave regions of very low s / n and systematic residuals caused by variations in the slit - width ( figure  [ sky_sub ] ) . without a constant s / n throughout the spectra , the cross - correlation peak can become skewed by noisy regions .    to extract both velocity and velocity dispersion information from our spectra we developed a modified cross - correlation technique that allows regions of very low signal - to - noise to be masked .",
    "this modification prevents us from using the usual mathematical techniques involving fourier transforms and instead utilizes a brute - force methodology .",
    "what it lacks in mathematical elegance , our procedure makes up for in functionality by being the only procedure we know of that works on spectra that are both low s / n and contaminated with systematic residuals .",
    "we describe our modified cross - correlation in detail in appendix  [ ap1 ] and compare its results to more traditional analysis methods in figure  [ cc_example ]",
    ". it may also be possible to use a penalized pixel - fitting technique to measure the kinematics from our spectra , but simulations show that the fitted parameters can become biased when the s / n is low ( 60 ) , or the losvd is poorly sampled @xcite .    for the stellar template , we used a kiii spectrum of star hd4388 downloaded from the gemini archive along with accompanying calibration frames of program gn-2002b - q-61 .",
    "the stellar spectrum was reduced and extracted using the gemini iraf routines .",
    "once extracted , the 1d stellar spectrum was broadened with a gaussian kernel to match the instrumental resolution of our observations .",
    "we found no significant changes when trying different template stars and find our uncertainties are never dominated by template mismatch .    because we have modified the traditional cross - correlation technique , we have no formal means of calculating uncertainties in our fitted velocity and losvd .",
    "we therefore run a series of monte carlo realizations to quantify the errors in our fitting procedure . for each galaxy ,",
    "we create 100 artificial 2d spectra .",
    "a template stellar spectrum is shifted to match a realistic rotation curve , and broadened to simulate both stellar velocity dispersion and instrumental resolution .",
    "we vary the detailed shape of the rotation curve and velocity dispersion for each realization by @xmath18% .",
    "the fake spectra have radial exponential flux profiles similar to the real galaxies .",
    "we add poisson noise to the artificial spectra , as well as systematic residuals by adding regions of sky from our science frames that do not have any detectable objects .",
    "thus , our artificial spectra have both the same gaussian sky background and similar systematic residuals as the real data .",
    "once the artificial spectra are made , we extract and analyze 1d spectra identically to the real data ( i.e. , we use the same extraction windows and the cross - correlation with masking procedure ) . in many instances",
    ", we found that our measured losvd poorly matched the input .",
    "the loss of reasonable losvd measurements is dominated by how many of the caii lines are masked due to sky line contamination .",
    "we therefore clip points where the monte carlo error analysis suggests we can not reliably recover the input parameters ( i.e. the rms error between input and output is @xmath21 km s@xmath5  or the output has a systematic error of @xmath22 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "these clipped regions typically correspond to regions of the rotation curve where the ca triplet line passes through a large sky residual .    our final extracted rotation curves , losvds , and monte carlo",
    "derived uncertainties are plotted in figure  [ all_rc ] along with @xmath2-band images of the galaxies showing the gemini longslit placements .",
    "although we attempted to place our slits in regions of the galaxies where the thin and thick disk light makes up the majority of the flux , it is nearly impossible to target regions where one stellar component completely dominates the flux . in the lower - mass galaxies",
    ", we found that the thick disk is a major stellar component and we should expect spectra taken along the midplane to include a large amount of thick disk light . in the higher mass galaxies ,",
    "the thin disk is the dominant component , and we are forced to observe off - plane regions that still contain a large fraction of thin disk light . using the photometric fits of @xcite , we can estimate the fractional flux levels of the thin and thick disk at each slit position . because each slit position should include both thin and thick disk stars",
    ", we make an attempt to model the true underlying rotation curves for each population . for simplicity , we assume that the thin and thick disk stars are each rotating cylindrically and therefore have the same rotation curve for both the on and off - plane observations .",
    "we discuss this choice in more detail in  [ ex_lags ] .",
    "the details of the vertical profiles of the stellar disks ( exponential vs sech@xmath23 ) can dramatically influence what fraction of the midplane light belongs to thin disk stars versus thin disk stars . as in @xcite , we adopt a series of photometric decomposition models that should cover the full range of possible thin and thick disk fractions . at one extreme , we use a simple model where we assume the midplane is composed of only thin disk light and the offplane observations purely thick disk stars . as a more accurate model , we use the thin / thick fractions from the best fitting models of @xcite as well as models where we vary the parameters by their 1-@xmath24 values to create a `` bright - thick and faint - thin '' model along with a `` faint - thick and bright - thin '' model .",
    "the differences between the thin and thick disk scale lengths are small enough that we do not expect much radial variation in the fraction of thin and thick disk light .    in @xcite , we fit analytic functions to the stellar rotation curves to decompose the thin and thick disk components .",
    "this worked well for the initial two galaxies we observed , but our expanded sample now includes galaxies with slightly irregular kinematics that are not well described by common parameterizations of rotation curves . instead of using an analytic function , we use the midplane h@xmath0 rotation curve as a basis function for the overall shape of the rotation curve . because we are most interested in finding the velocity of the thin and thick disk stars relative to each other , we compare them both to the well resolved and high signal - to - noise midplane h@xmath0 rotation curve . using the @xmath16  rotation curve",
    "reduces the number of parameters that need to be fit to characterize the stellar rotation curves .",
    "we model the stellar rotation curves as @xmath25 .",
    "we constrain @xmath26 to be in the range @xmath27 ( to account for any small error in wavelength calibration between frames or regions on the chip ) and @xmath28 is limited to @xmath29 , allowing for stars to be rotating faster than the gas by up to 40% ( @xmath28=1.4 ) , not rotating ( @xmath28=0 ) , or counter - rotating with the opposite velocity of the h@xmath0 ( @xmath28=-1 ) .",
    "the decomposed rotation curves are plotted in figure  [ decomp_rc ] .",
    "the left hand panels show the best fit stellar rotation curve scaled from the @xmath16  at each slit position .",
    "if there were no cross - contamination of thin and thick disk stars , then the offplane and midplane rotation curves would show the true thick and thin disk kinematics .",
    "the right hand panels show the more realistic case where we have adopted likely amounts of thin and thick disk contamination at each slit position before inferring the underlying kinematics of each population .    for the higher mass galaxies , we find no substantial difference between the thin and thick disk rotation curves , even when we correct for the expected cross contamination .",
    "there is a slight tendency for the thick component to be lagging , but never by more than 5 km s@xmath5 . in the higher mass galaxies",
    ", we have therefore either failed to observe an offplane region with a high enough thick disk flux fraction , or the thick disks are not lagging significantly compared to the thin disk in these systems .    for the low - mass galaxies , we find a wide range of behavior .",

    "most of the other galaxies in our sample have losvds across the disk of @xmath33 km s@xmath5 , essentially the same as our instrumental resolution at the ca ii triplet .",
    "the stellar rotation curve for fgc 1948 also shows large deviation from the h@xmath0 rc , suggesting that the stars in this galaxy might not be fully rotationally supported and/or fully dynamically relaxed .",
    "fgc 227 s losvd also deviates from the simple interpretation of a dynamically cold rotating disk . in the midplane observations ,",
    "the central regions of fgc 227 appear cold ( @xmath34 km s@xmath5 ) , but the outer disk reaches losvd values of 100 - 150 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this makes little sense for a galaxy with a well defined rotation curve as the intrinsic stellar velocity dispersions should be decreasing with radius .",
    "in contrast , the losvd can be well explained by a rotationally supported galaxy if there are two stellar populations moving in opposite rotational directions .",
    "as our rotation curve decomposition showed , fgc 227 is best fit by a model where the thick disk is counter - rotating relative to the thin disk . as we showed in @xcite",
    ", this would cause an increase in the observed velocity dispersion of order 50 km s@xmath5 .",
    "similar projection effects are found in elliptical galaxies with counter - rotating cores as they also show radially increasing losvds @xcite .",
    "inspired by the best - fit rotation curve for fgc 227 , we investigate the possibility that all thick disks contain some fraction of counter - rotating stars .",
    "our data is able to place tight constraints on the amount of counter - rotating material since both the offplane rotation curves and the midplane losvd will be strongly affected by any counter - rotating stars .    in section  [ sstell_kin ] , we imposed thin and thick disk flux fractions based on previous photometric decompositions .",
    "we now leave the flux fractions as free parameters and instead hold the rotation curve shapes fixed .",
    "we fit two simple models , each with two kinematically independent stellar components . in the first model , we assume there are two stellar components , one rotating identically as the gas and one with zero net rotation , as one might expect for a stellar halo . the final observed rotation curve is a flux weighted average of these two curves and we fit for the best fitting flux ratio .",
    "we restricted the explored parameter space such that the rotation curves had to be some positive linear combination of the midplane h@xmath0 and a non - rotating or counter - rotating rotation curve .",
    "in the second model , we assume the second component is counter - rotating with a velocity one - half the magnitude of the h@xmath0 rotation curve .",
    "for both models , we calculate uncertainties from the covariance matrix and scale them upwards such that the reduced-@xmath20 equals unity ( i.e. , we assume our model should be a good fit ) .",
    "we do not calculate uncertainties when the fit converges to a boundary condition .",
    "we also do not construct detailed models for cases like fgc 1415 where the stars could be better fit with a faster rotation curve than the gas ; these galaxies naturally converge on the boundary condition of having no second component .",
    "it should be emphasized that these are simple toy models , and we have no direct evidence of counter rotating thick disk stars beyond the strange rotation curve of fgc 270 .",
    "for example , if we observed a mw like ( v@xmath35 km s@xmath5 ) galaxy that had a 10% ( by flux ) thick disk lagging at 40 km s@xmath5 , we would compute a maximum counter - rotating fraction of 1% and a non - rotating fraction of 2% , despite all the stars being co - rotators .",

    "unlike the rotational velocity measurement , which is mostly unaffected by flux contributions from different radii , we expect the losvd to be significantly broadened by projection effects .",
    "we also find that in most of our galaxies the losvd is very close to the instrumental resolution , making any interpretation of the velocity dispersion suspect . because of these challenges , we limit our analysis of the losvd to only those cases where we believe our measurements are of high quality and not dominated by the instrumental dispersion .",
    "the results of sections  [ srcs ] and [ sstell_kin ] show that stellar kinematics above the midplane display a wide range of behaviors . in higher mass systems ( fgce 1371 , fgce 1498 , fgc 1440 ) ,",

    "however , @xcite found that the stellar flux in higher mass galaxies are dominated by the thin disk component .",
    "therefore , the lack of a significant lag in these systems is likely a result of the kinematically cold thin disk dominating the stellar flux to scale heights of 1 kpc .",
    "this result is not completely unexpected , as the mw thin and thick disks should have similar luminosities 1 kpc off the midplane @xcite .",
    "we note that there is still ample photometric evidence that these higher mass galaxies contain thick disks , but they are simply too faint relative to the thin disk for modest kinematic lags to be detected spectroscopically",
    ".    the low mass galaxies in our sample do show measurable differences between the midplane and offplane observations . at large radii",
    ", we find several galaxies where the offplane component is lagging compared to the midplane ( figure  [ gmod_fig ] ) . in three of the low mass systems ( fgc 1415 , fgc 1642 , and fgc 780 ) ,",
    "the lags in the offplane observations become more pronounced when we correct for the expected thin disk contamination .",

    "thus , the lags in these systems do not necessarily require the presence of any counter - rotating material , although a small amount of such material could be present .",
    "fgc 2558 may also fall into this category ; however the offplane rc is very similar to the midplane , implying this could be another galaxy where we have not successfully isolated the thick disk .",

    "the final two low mass galaxies in our sample , fgc 227 and fgc 1948 , have remarkably different rotation curves between the midplane and offplane .",
    "fgc 1948 does not display coherent stellar rotation in either the midplane or the offplane , and therefore our subsequent fits converge to extreme , and probably incorrect , models .",
    "fgc 227 does show rotation on the midplane , and a very low level of net rotation on the offplane .",
    "our best fitting model for this galaxy has the thick disk counter - rotating relative to the thin disk , consistent with the radially increasing losvd which is a signature of unresolved counter rotating stellar components .",
    "our measurements of the losvd are less than enlightening . with the exception of the radial increase in the losvd in fgc 227 and the high losvd in fgc 1948 ,",
    "the rest of our losvd measurements show no significant trends with radius and are close to the instrumental resolution limit , suggesting that the radial velocity dispersions of both the thin and thick disks are cold enough that we can not reliably measure their velocity dispersions at our spectral resolution .",
    "given the above results , our galaxies can be described as falling into three categories : the high mass systems which have little to no thick disk lag ( or , more likely , thick disks which are so faint that we have failed to measure their kinematics ) ; the moderately lagging systems ; and the counter rotating system .",
    "we can now compare these results to the predictions of popular formation models for the thick disk .",
    "if thick disks are the result of gradual stochastic heating , we would expect to always find thick disks co - rotating with the embedded thin disks .",
    "moreover , with stronger spiral arms , larger molecular clouds , and more massive dark matter substructure , the high mass systems should be able to efficiently heat their thin disk stars into a thicker disk . instead",
    ", we have found the opposite , with more prominent thick disks and larger lags in the lower mass systems , as well as evidence for counter - rotating stars .",
    "this seems to rule out gradual heating as the dominant method of thick disk formation , particularly for low mass galaxies .",
    "forming thick disks in major mergers also does a poor job explaining our observations .",
    "if thick disks were predominantly formed in major mergers that disrupt and heat previously thin disks , we should expect to find galaxies that never formed a thick disk , or that have failed to accrete and cool enough gas to rebuild their thin disk components .",
    "major mergers also typically result in the formation of centrally concentrated spheroidal components , making them a poor mechanism for forming thick disks in the bulgeless galaxies observed here .",
    "unlike the two heating models , the variety of thick disk kinematics is compatible with minor mergers and/or accretion . presumably , the thick disk kinematics we observe are simply the kinematics left over from the accretion event which deposited the majority of thick disk stars or which triggered the formation of stars from gas accreted at large scale heights",
    ". the wide variety of possible accretion events ( co - rotating vs counter rotating , early disruption vs late disruption , high eccentricity vs circular initial orbit ) can evolve into virialized thick disks with kinematics that are sometimes decoupled from the thin disks and that show large variation from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the ubiquity of thick disks is also well explained by the merger / accretion scenario , given that galaxy formation in a @xmath56cdm cosmology is dominated by hierarchical merging , and predicts that every galaxy has a rich merger history .",
    "although the available data all points to a merger / accretion origin for the thick disk , it is difficult to disentangle models where thick disk stars are directly accreted from those where the stars form _ in situ _ further off the midplane during gas rich mergers @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity results from two sources .",
    "first , there is no clear dividing line between what one calls a star - forming region off the midplane and a merging star - forming satellite galaxy .",
    "second , we know from @xcite that at least 75 - 90% of the baryonic accretion onto the galaxies was gaseous , and some fraction of this was certainly accreted in bound subhalos",
    ". stars that formed initially in subhalos before being accreted are likely to have kinematics similar to those that formed from accreted gas during those same merging events .",
    "presumably , one could use detailed stellar age and abundance information to help , but unfortunately this is only possible for the closest galaxies .",
    "there is evidence that much of the brighter inner halo and outer disk substructure of m31 was formed through accretion @xcite .",
    "these features would probably resemble a thick disk if m31 were more distant and the features were unresolved . taking this lesson from nearby galaxies , it is clear we are using smooth functions to describe thick disk that may actually be highly structured systems .",
    "however , the smooth descriptions of thick disks still provide a reasonable statistical description of the ensemble of accreted stars .    in this study",
    ", we have measured thick disk kinematics in only very late - type disk systems . however",

    "although direct chi - squared fitting works well in some situations , at low s / n(@xmath5920 ) , any direct chi - squared fitting routine will over - smooth the data because the low s / n continuum is best fit by a strait line ( i.e. , an over - broadened template star ) . in previous studies that have used direct fitting",
