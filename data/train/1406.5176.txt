    "nanoparticles play a vital role in many industrial processes and natural phenomena , including areas such as chemical engineering , biomedical technology , material science , physics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "nanoparticles are often suspended in fluids during production , handling , and processing , but also after unintentional or undesired release to the environment . in many cases",
    "the suspending fluid is a gas , as in the case of large scale commercial production of nanoparticles , air pollution or clean room technology .",
    "these applications have increased the interest in micro- and nanofluidics and have triggered the development of simulation methods and numerical schemes .",
    "for example , direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) methods have been used in the modeling of small - scale devices with characteristic dimensions of microns down to nanometers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dsmc is an ideal particle based scheme for the study of hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite . moving boundary problems for kinetic equations have been recently investigated extensively in connection with mems , see @xcite for an overview . to simulate such problems , dsmc as well as deterministic methods",
    "have been applied . in recent years",
    "several works have been reported for moving boundary problems in a rarefied gas , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to simulate moving rigid bodies in a rarefied gas , not only the influence of the moving boundary on the gas has to be included in the simulation , but also the forces exerted by the gas accelerating the rigid body .",
    "see , for example @xcite for one - dimensional situations with such a two - way coupling .",
    "we remark that , on the one hand , using dsmc based approaches for the above time - dependent problems with slow fluid flows requires some control over the large fluctuations inherent in these methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the deterministic approaches are complicated to extend and computationally costly for higher dimensions .",
    "finally , we note that dsmc methods are especially suited to couple moving rigid objects due to the lagrangian nature of the gas molecules .",
    "in this paper we present a simulation scheme for moving rigid bodies of arbitrary shape suspended in a rarefied gas suited for three dimensions . as an implementation of the scheme we consider a rigid spherical body contained inside a cube of micron size .",
    "the rarefied gas flow is simulated by solving the boltzmann equation in a time dependent domain of computation using a dsmc particle method",
    ". the rigid body motion is given by the newton - euler equations , where the forces on the rigid body are calculated from the momentum transfer due to gas molecules impinging on the surface of the rigid body .",
    "the resulting motion of the rigid body affects in turn again the gas flow in the surroundings .",
    "this means that a two - way coupling has to be modeled . to validate our numerical scheme , we investigate 3d brownian motion of a spherical rigid body suspended in a gas and compare the numerical results with the einstein relation . both the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom of the particle",
    "are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we perform a convergence study comparing the numerically computed translational and rotational diffusion coefficients to existing theoretical values for an increasing number of simulated gas molecules .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly present the boltzmann equation and a numerical method for solving it . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the force and the torque exerted on the rigid body due to the surrounding gas medium and also present a scheme based on the interaction of gas molecules and the rigid body and its implementation to estimate the force and the torque on the rigid body in a dsmc framework . in section 4 ,",
    "we describe the translational and rotational brownian motions of a rigid spherical particle suspended in a gas based on langevin s equations and also present the derivation of the corresponding diffusion coefficients .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section 5 , and some concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "the boltzmann equation describes the time evolution of a distribution function @xmath0 for particles with velocity @xmath1 and position @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .",
    "it is given in nondimensional form as * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath4 with the initial condition @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the knudsen number , the ratio of mean free path and characteristic length , @xmath7 is the collision operator which is given for hard - sphere molecules by @xmath8 d\\omega({\\bf n})d{\\bf w},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the unit sphere in @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the unit vector in the impact direction , @xmath12 is the collision cross section , @xmath13 , and analogously for @xmath14 etc .",
    "the pair @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pre- and post- collisional velocities of two colliding gas molecules , given by @xmath17 } , { \\bf w } ' = { \\bf w + n[n\\cdot(v - w)]}.\\ ] ] for more details we refer to @xcite .",
    "we note that in this paper the characteristic length is the diameter of the rigid body",
    ". for the investigations in the present paper one has to solve ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) in a time dependent domain given by the moving nanoparticle and predefined outer boundaries .",
    "we consider diffuse reflection boundary conditions at the outer boundaries of the domain of computation and at the surface of the rigid body .",
    "it is worth noting that the diffuse reflection boundary condition at the rigid body has to be evaluated in the co - moving frame of reference .",
    "we solve the boltzmann equation using a variant of the dsmc method @xcite , developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the time splitting of the boltzmann equation . introducing fractional steps",
    "one first solves the free transport equation ( the collisionless boltzmann equation ) for one time step . during the free flow ,",
    "boundary conditions are taken into account . in this paper",
    "we consider a closed cube containing a rigid spherical body .",
    "as already mentioned , diffuse reflection boundary conditions apply at all boundaries . in a second step ( the collision step ) , the spatially homogenous boltzmann equation without the transport term is solved . to solve the homogeneous boltzmann equation ,",
    "the key point is to find an efficient particle approximation of the product distribution functions in the boltzmann collision operator given only an approximation of the distribution function itself . to simulate this equation by a particle method",
    "an explicit euler step is performed . to guarantee positivity of the distribution function during the collision step ,",
    "a restriction of the time step proportional to the knudsen number is needed .",
    "that means that the method becomes exceedingly expensive for small knudsen numbers . in such regimes",
    ", a special algorithm adapted to the small knudsen number limit has to be used , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since here we aim at the large knudsen number regime , we will not go into details concerning this issue .",
    "the cube is discretized using a uniform grid size along all axes , resulting in a cubic grid .",
    "the initial phase space distribution of the gas is a maxwellian distribution with the initial temperature , density and mean velocity as its parameters .",
    "the temperature is kept at the initial temperature throughout the simulations .",
    "the initial mean velocity and the initial velocity of the rigid body is zero .",
    "the computational grid is divided into three sets .",
    "gas cells completely filled by gas molecules , rigid body cells completely covered by the rigid body and boundary cells which are partially filled by gas molecules and partially by the rigid body .",
    "we note that due to the motion of the body we have to update the volume of the cells occupied by the gas at every time step .",
    "this update can be done efficiently by marking the boundary cells and its neighboring cells near the surface of the rigid body . only the boundary cells and its neighbor cells are the candidate of the boundary cells in the next time step",
    ". some computational efforts are necessary to update the volume of boundary cells occupied by the gas .",
    "this is obtained by a monte carlo method using particles .",
    "let @xmath18 be the initial number of gas molecules per cell .",
    "we distribute randomly @xmath18 molecules in boundary cells and we set a counter how many molecules are lying outside the rigid body .",
    "we repeat this process for @xmath19 times and then take the average of the counter . the gas volume fraction and the direction of the surface normal of the rigid body in the boundary cells are sufficient for the dsmc simulation near the boundary .",
    "generally , a rigid body suspended in a gas ( representing , for example , a nanoparticle ) moves under the influence of surface and volume forces .",
    "the surface forces are due to collisions of gas molecules with the body .",
    "in addition , different types of volume forces could be present , such as electrostatic and gravitational forces . in this work ,",
    "we only consider the effect of the surface forces onto the rigid body .",
    "it should be noted , that via the solution of the newton - euler equations , inertial forces are taken care of automatically .      to compute the surface force exerted on the rigid body by the surrounding gas we proceed as follows .",
    "we note that the following process can be applied to an arbitrarily shaped rigid body with obvious modifications . in this paper we consider a rigid spherical particle .",
    "let @xmath20 be the rigid spherical particle with boundary @xmath21 and center of mass @xmath22 at any moment in time @xmath23 .",
    "the force @xmath24 and the torque @xmath25 exerted on the rigid sphere from the surrounding fluid is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total stress tensor in the fluid and @xmath28 is the outward normal to the boundary @xmath29 of the body . using equations ( [ eq : hydrodynamicforceonsphere ] ) and ( [ eq : hydrodynamictorqueonsphere ] ) , the translational and rotational motion of the rigid body is described by the newton - euler equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass and moment of inertia of the spherical particle , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the translational and rotational velocities of the spherical particle , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ eq : translationalvelocityofsphere ] ) and ( [ eq : rotationalvelocityofsphere ] ) can be solved for @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "the total velocity @xmath36 that combines both the translational and rotational motion of the rigid body is given by @xmath37 .",
    "correspondingly , the equation of motion for points on the surface is @xmath38      to compute the force @xmath39 and the torque @xmath25 on the spherical particle , at first we have to compute the stress tensor @xmath27 in the fluid domain and finally insert the value of @xmath27 in the equations ( [ eq : hydrodynamicforceonsphere ] ) and ( [ eq : hydrodynamictorqueonsphere ] ) . for a dilute gas ,",
    "the flow is modeled by kinetic theory and given by the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath27 can be computed as a moment of the phase - space distribution function . however , for moving boundary problems the correct numerical approximation of the stress tensor in the dsmc cells which are partially covered by the rigid body is not very accurate , because of the small number of simulated molecules in that cell .",
    "thus , we compute the force and the torque from the interaction of the fluid molecules and the rigid particle .",
    "this is similar to a microscopic approach where the force and the torque would be computed by the collision of the spherical particle with the simulated gas molecules .",
    "when the gas molecules collide with the spherical particle , they transfer momentum and energy .",
    "therefore , the total force and the total torque exerted on the spherical particle are computed by accumulating the increments of the linear and angular momentum imparted by all the colliding molecules to the rigid body .",
    "this leads to the following procedure to approximate numerically the force and the torque exerted on the spherical particle .",
    "+ let us discretize the boundary @xmath40 of the spherical particle by a uniformly distributed pointset @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider a gas molecule hitting the particle surface at a point @xmath42 with momentum @xmath43 , being reflected with momentum @xmath44 . in the following we assume that gas molecule is reflected diffusively from the boundary of the moving spherical particle .",
    "then we find the closest neighbor @xmath45 of @xmath46 in the pointset @xmath47 to store pre- and post- collision momenta of that molecule . during the time interval @xmath48 , there could be a number of such gas molecules impinging at a position whose closest neighbor is @xmath45 .",
    "the total pre- and post- collision momenta at @xmath45 are calculated by taking the sum of pre - collision momenta @xmath43 and post - collision momenta @xmath44 of those molecules which impinge in the neighborhood of @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath50 be the total pre- and post - collision momenta at the point @xmath45 .",
    "then , the force @xmath51 and the torque @xmath52 exerted on the spherical particle at @xmath45 during the time interval @xmath48 are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the center of mass of the spherical particle .",
    "hence , the total force @xmath24 and the total torque @xmath25 on the spherical particle are given by @xmath55 each dsmc molecule represents a large number of physical gas molecules .",
    "therefore , we need to determine the mass of each dsmc simulated molecule to be used in the momentum transfer calculation .",
    "we employ the ideal gas law @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of moles and @xmath58 is the system volume . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the universal and specific gas constants , respectively . from ( [ eq : ideagaseqn1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ideagaseqn2 ] ) , we can write @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the avogadro number .",
    "the total number of physical gas molecules in the system is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass of a physical gas molecule .",
    "+ define @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the total number of dsmc simulated molecules , hence @xmath67 is the number of physical gas molecules representing a single dsmc simulated molecule .",
    "this is also known as the statistical weight of the simulated dsmc molecule .",
    "thus , the mass of a dsmc molecule is given by @xmath68 equations ( [ eq : numnerofmolecules ] ) , ( [ eq : weightsimulatedmolecule ] ) and ( [ eq : masssimulatedmolecule ] ) finally yield @xmath69 thus , the force and the torque ( [ eq : forceonsphere1 ] ) and ( [ eq : torqueonsphere1 ] ) are rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the pre- and post- collisional velocities . with these expressions",
    "we can determine the translational and rotational motion of the spherical particle , solving ( [ eq : translationalvelocityofsphere ] ) , ( [ eq : rotationalvelocityofsphere ] ) and ( [ eq : sphericalbodyposition ] ) .",
    "for the time integration we use an explicit euler scheme with given initial velocities @xmath73 and initial configuration @xmath74 of the spherical particle .",
    "we have considered the same time step @xmath48 for both newton - euler equations as well as the dsmc method .",
    "the theory of translational brownian motion is concerned with the calculation of the probability density for the position of a rigid particle in a fluid .",
    "it is usually based on langevin s equation , which is newton s second law with the assumption that the force acting on the rigid particle is the sum of a viscous retarding force proportional to the velocity of the rigid particle and a rapidly fluctuating force whose statistical properties are such that the the velocity distribution approaches a maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "analogously , rotational brownian motion is concerned with the calculation of the probability density of the orientation of a body in a fluid .",
    "the specification of the orientation of a body requires three coordinates , such as euler s angles . here , we consider the simple case where the rigid particle rotates about a fixed axis through its center of mass .",
    "the theory of rotational brownian motion is again based on a langevin equation .",
    "consider a system composed of @xmath75 monoatomic gas molecules occupying a volume @xmath58 and having an absolute temperature @xmath76 .",
    "let us consider a rigid particle suspended in a rarefied gas .",
    "the particle undergoes a random motion due to the impacting gas molecules .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the velocity of the particle relative to the gas .",
    "the theory of brownian motion states that the velocity of the particle follows the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution which is given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass of the particle and @xmath80 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the mean square velocity can be calculated by taking the second moment of the velocity distribution ( [ eq : maxwellveldisparticle ] ) and is given by @xmath81 hence , the mean translational kinetic energy of the particle is given by @xmath82 the random impact of the surrounding gas molecules generally causes two kinds of effects : firstly , they act as a random driving force on the brownian particle to maintain its irregular motion , and , secondly , they give rise to a friction force .",
    "a simple model for the brownian motion of a particle with mass @xmath31 and center of mass @xmath83 is the phenomenological stochastic equation @xcite @xmath84 denoted as langevin equation .",
    "the frictional force exerted by the medium is represented by the first term on the right - hand side , where @xmath85 is the translational friction coefficient , assumed to be independent of the particle velocity .",
    "the second term , @xmath86 , is the random force due to collisions with the surrounding gas molecules .",
    "+ for the sake of simplicity and idealization , the random force is usually assumed to be a white noise process @xcite with autocorrelation function @xmath87    at long times , the explicit solution of equation ( [ eq : langevin1 ] ) yields a variance for the velocity @xmath77 given by @xmath88    assuming that the distribution of velocites follows a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , we obtain ( see nelson @xcite ) @xmath89 for long times , the corresponding variance of @xmath22 is given by @xmath90 , with the translational diffusion coefficient @xmath91 resulting in @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the initial position of the particle .",
    "this is the same variance as for a classical diffusion process with diffusion constant @xmath94 .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a numerical scheme to simulate a moving rigid body with arbitrary shape suspended in a rarefied gas . </S>",
    "<S> the rarefied gas is simulated by solving the boltzmann equation using a dsmc particle method . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the rigid body is governed by the newton - euler equations , where the force and the torque on the rigid body is computed from the momentum transfer of the gas molecules colliding with the body . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the motion of the rigid body influences the gas flow in its surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> we validate the numerical results by testing the einstein relation for brownian motion of the suspended particle . </S>",
    "<S> the translational as well as the rotational degrees of freedom are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the numerically computed translational and rotational diffusion coefficients converge to the theoretical values .    </S>",
