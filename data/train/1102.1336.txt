    "the recently discovered 18 ( van der horst et al . 2010 ) has a period @xmath9 s ( g , woods & kouveliotou 2009 ) in the narrow range of axp and sgr periods ( mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the spin - down rate has not been measured yet ( kuiper & hermsen 2009 , woods , g & kouveliotou 2009 , esposito et al . 2010 ,",

    "@xmath10 s s@xmath11 ( rea et al . 2010 ) , evaluated as dipole spin - down of an isolated star , gives a surface dipole magnetic field @xmath12 g at the poles , much lower than fields previously deduced from spin - down rates of magnetars .",
    "the characteristic age @xmath13 yrs , while axps and sgrs , some of which are associated with snr ( esposito et al .",
    "2009 , mereghetti 2008 and references therein ) are believed to be young neutron stars with ages @xmath8 yr .",
    "18 is similar to other axps and sgrs in all observed properties except for @xmath14 .",
    "the energy in its soft gamma - ray bursts requires a total magnetic field @xmath15 g on the neutron star surface , but if all sgrs have super - outbursts occasionally , so far observed from sgr 1806 - 20 , sgr 0526 - 66 and sgr 1900 + 14 , the total surface magnetic field @xmath16 g according to the magnetar model ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) . if 18 is a standard magnetar , it provides a clear counterexample to the proposition that for magnetars the dipole component of the magnetic field is of the same order as the total field .",
    "if the spindown to the present period was achieved by magnetic dipole radiation 18 would be an exceptional object , mimicking all sgr and axp properties while not belonging to the class .",
    "its position in the @xmath0 diagram , beyond the so called death - valley , makes it exceptional also among the rotation powered isolated pulsars : the only other source located similarly in @xmath0 is the radio pulsar 144 .",
    "furthermore , if 18 is older than @xmath17 yrs as its characteristic age @xmath18 suggests , its quiescent x - ray luminosity can not be explained by cooling , reheating or magnetic field decay , let alone explaining soft gamma - ray outbursts occurring at such old age . if 18 is much younger than its characteristic age with dipole spin - down , its initial rotation period would have to be close to the present 9.1 s period , again making this source unique , standing far out from the initial period distribution inferred from population synthesis ( faucher - gigure & kaspi 2006 ) .",
    "the dipole component of the field @xmath19 determines torques due to electromagnetic radiation and interactions with the environment .",
    "estimates of @xmath19 from spin - down rates depend on the torque mechanism .",
    "the total surface magnetic field is derived from measurements of cyclotron lines ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2002 ) and the spectral continuum ( gver et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) .",
    "historically , the dipole field measurements came first ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "the field inferred with the dipole spin - down torque was in the magnetar range , supporting the magnetar model which had been proposed to explain the sgr bursts and other sgr and axp properties including spindown to long periods at a young age ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "the identification of the dipole component with the total field has been taken for granted .",
    "we proceed , by occam s razor , to posit that 18 is a member of the same class of young neutron stars as the other sgrs and axps , but its spin down is not due to magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "so there must be matter around the star , in a bound state , therefore carrying angular momentum . for _ isolated _ neutron stars a fallback disk , which can be formed in some supernovae ( michel 1988 , chevalier 1989 , lin et al .",
    "1991 ) will provide this .",
    "the fallback disk model was proposed by chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for axps , and independently by alpar ( 2001 ) as a possible way of explaining the different classes of young neutron stars , including the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) and compact central objects ( ccos ) as well as axps and sgrs .",
    "the prime motivation was to address the period clustering which strongly suggests a regulating store of angular momentum . for a given value of @xmath20",
    "the dipole moment inferred with fallback disk model is generally less than that derived assuming isolated dipole spin - down .",
    "the differences in @xmath20 between sources of similar period are not primarily due to differences in magnetic dipole moment , with the fallback disk also playing a critical role in evolution .",
    "the model indicates surface dipole fields @xmath21 g. the bursts may be powered by strong total magnetic fields @xmath16 g as in the magnetar model- implying that the dipole field is smaller than the total field . the discovery of a disk around 42 ( wang , chakrabarty & kaplan 2006 ) gave strong support to the fallback disk model .",
    "ertan et al ( 2007 ) showed that the entire non - pulsed optical to mid - ir spectrum can be understood as emission from a gaseous disk , while the pulsed optical signal is produced in the magnetosphere ( ertan & cheng 2004 , cheng & ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "this letter investigates evolutionary scenarios for 18 employing a fallback disk .",
    "we show that the period derivative as well as the period and x - ray luminosity in quiescence are explained quite naturally , and a fallback disk can spin down the neutron star to a period of 9.1 s in a few 10@xmath22 to @xmath8 years .",
    "the mass and mass inflow rate of the fallback disk decay through viscous dynamics , modified by irradiation from the neutron star .",
    "the fallback disk , though truncated at the inner radius , follows the self - similar solutions with power law decay in time ( pringle 1974 ) quite closely as long as the entire disk is viscous ( ertan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "viscous activity stops when the local temperature falls below a critical temperature @xmath23 @xmath24 k , becoming too cold for sufficient ionization for the magneto - rotational instability to generate viscosity and sustain mass inflow ( inutsuka & sano 2005 ) .",
    "such passive regions grow starting from the outer disk .",
    "irradiation by the star can keep the outer disk at temperatures higher than @xmath25 for a while , delaying the passive phase , keeping a larger part of the disk active .",
    "this interaction between the gradual transition to a final passive phase , and the effect of irradiation to prolong the active phase determines the evolution in a complicated way . to calculate the irradiation flux impinging on the disk we employ the same irradiation efficiency as in our best fits for the disk observed around 42 ( ertan et al .",
    "2007 , see ertan & alikan 2006 for the other axps ) .    at each step in the evolution",
    "a solution for the entire disk is constructed taking all these effects into account .",
    "the mass inflow rate @xmath26 arriving at the inner disk is obtained and the inner disk radius @xmath27 is determined as the   radius @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the solar mass , @xmath30 the mass inflow rate in 10@xmath31 gm s@xmath11 , and @xmath32 the dipole magnetic moment in @xmath33 g @xmath34 .",
    "the important distance scales are the light cylinder radius @xmath35 , the co - rotation radius @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the fallback disk will effect the evolution when the disk s inner radius is within the neutron star s light cylinder .",
    "the effect of the disk will decrease drastically when the disk moves outside the light cylinder .    throughout the evolution @xmath38 , so the neutron star is a fast rotator , and the torque applied by the disk is always a spin - down torque .",
    "the neutron star is in the propeller regime ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "in contrast to the original propeller picture the fallback disk model takes some portion @xmath39 of the mass inflow @xmath26 to be accreting onto the neutron star during spin - down ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 , alpar 2001 ) .",
    "rappaport , fregeau & spruit ( 2004 ) have shown from general considerations of accreting neutron stars that partial accretion must be taking place .",
    "this provides the x - ray luminosity in the fallback disk model throughout most of the evolution , when @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosity evolution is determined by the unknown fraction @xmath41 and the initial fallback disk mass @xmath42 which effects the evolution of @xmath26 .",
    "the spin - down rate of a neutron star under disk torques is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the moment of inertia , @xmath45 the spin - down rate , @xmath46 the rotation rate , @xmath26 the mass inflow rate arriving from the disk at its inner boundary , and @xmath47 is the star s mass .",
    "@xmath48 is the dimensionless torque which depends on the fastness parameter @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the keplerian rotation rate at @xmath37 .",
    "a dimensionless disk torque @xmath51 is indicated by our earlier results ( ertan et al .",
    "2009 , ertan & erkut 2008 ) .",
    "this torque is due to the azimuthal bending of magnetic field lines from the co - rotating magnetosphere at @xmath52 to the slower rotating inner disk at @xmath38 .",
    "equations ( 1)-(3 ) show that the torque is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "( @xmath53 gives a weak dependence @xmath54 ) .",
    "we integrate @xmath45 to get @xmath46 , reconstruct the disk , with current @xmath37 and @xmath55 , irradiated by the current luminosity , and proceed by iteration .",
    "as @xmath26 decreases and the star spins down , @xmath37 increases with time faster than @xmath55 does .",
    "near and beyond the light cylinder @xmath55 the electromagnetic field gradually changes from the dipole magnetic field to wave fields . the inner disk radius is somewhat larger than @xmath37 in this region .",
    "eki & alpar ( 2005 ) have studied the transition towards the wave zone .",
    "they show that the disk is stable beyond the light cylinder as long as the inner disk radius @xmath56 remains within a critical distance which depends on the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the star , ranging from 2.5 @xmath55 for a perpendicular rotator to many @xmath55 for an almost aligned rotator .",
    "the torque and luminosity should drop within a narrow range of @xmath57  the disk can be stable far beyond @xmath55 , but is causally disconnected from the star and magnetosphere . cooling or energy dissipation in the neutron star account for a much reduced x - ray luminosity . for the torque we consider two distinct models : ( i ) we assume that the disk remains undetached from the light cylinder and set @xmath58 .",
    "this can be qualitatively justified as mass lost by the disk can not penetrate into the magnetosphere , but will tend to pile up around the light cylinder . as the disk inner radius reaches @xmath55 from inside the mass pile - up is likely to keep @xmath56 from detaching from @xmath55 .",
    "( ii ) the minimal torque is the dipole radiation torque taking over immediately when @xmath59 .",
    "the actual torque should show a transition from disk torque to dipole radiation torque .",
    "we have carried out a detailed investigation of 18 using the code developed earlier ( ertan & erkut 2008 ; ertan et al .",
    "2009 ) which successfully generated axp and sgr properties at their likely ages by luminosity and spindown evolution driven by a fallback disk . many combinations of initial conditions were tried in search for a scenario to produce the present day 18 .",
    "each calculation starts with a choice of dipole moment and initial rotation period for the neutron star , and an initial disk mass .",
    "the disk around 18 can not still be inside the light cylinder at present : if it were , @xmath20 would be approximately ( or exactly , in our torque model ) independent of @xmath26 in this epoch , so that the age estimate would be given by @xmath60 y , an untenably old age .",
    "we find that 18 was spun - down to its period with efficient disk torques in a past epoch when the inner disk was within the light cylinder , @xmath20 having subsequently decreased to its present value in the present epoch when the disk is at or beyond @xmath55 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show evolutionary tracks for luminosity , period and period derivative , producing the present properties of 18 for numerous combinations of the initial conditions .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolutionary models with @xmath61 ms for @xmath62 g , with initial disk masses @xmath63 respectively . in figure 2",
    ", we show evolutionary tracks with @xmath64 g and @xmath65 ms , with @xmath66 .",
    "a reference luminosity @xmath67 is plotted throughout the past epoch when the inner disk was inside the light cylinder .",
    "the true luminosity was less by the unknown fraction @xmath41 .",
    "this uncertainty does not influence the evolutionary models because its effect on the disk is folded into the irradiation efficiency .",
    "we took @xmath19 in the @xmath68 g range of dipole fields for most young pulsars , which worked in earlier applications ( ertan et al .",
    "all axps and sgrs have @xmath69 erg / s , giving an upper limit for @xmath70 in our searches .",
    "@xmath42 is calculated for disk models extending to an outer radius @xmath71 cm at the start . for given @xmath19 ,",
    "disks lighter than a certain @xmath70 can never penetrate the light cylinder , and so can not produce an axp / sgr . for each @xmath19 - @xmath70 choice , there is a minimum @xmath72 for the inner disk to ever lie within @xmath55 .",
    "the degeneracy of initial conditions producing 18 shows that these correlations between workable initial conditions are not very strict constraints . for most @xmath19 and @xmath70 , models start off with the inner disk within the light cylinder .",
    "( models with stronger @xmath19 and lower @xmath70 show different early evolution , with @xmath73 initially . starting off under the dipole spin - down torque , the low luminosity @xmath74 erg s@xmath11 in the initial phases is due to cooling ( page 2009 ) and dissipative dynamics inside the neutron star ( alpar 2007 ) .",
    "these models show sudden luminosity and torque increase at @xmath75 yrs when the inner disk enters the light cylinder . )    between @xmath7 and @xmath76 y , there is a turnover to fast luminosity decay with rapid spin - down until the period settles to its present value of 9.1 s. the fall - back disk is evolving towards its final passive phase .",
    "as @xmath26 drops , so does the rate of viscous heating .",
    "effects of irradiation also start to drop as the accretion luminosity decreases with mass inflow rate .",
    "starting from the outermost parts , more and more sections of the disk are cooling below the critical temperature @xmath77 . as this continues , @xmath26 arriving at the inner disk to provide for accretion decreases even more rapidly .",
    "the positive feedback leads to a luminosity turnover and eventual cutoff . throughout this phase",
    ", @xmath37 is inside the light cylinder and the disk torque remains in effect .",
    "the light cylinder recedes as the star spins down , but the inner disk recedes more rapidly with the accelerated decay of @xmath26 , and finally reaches @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath20 now starts dropping very rapidly and the period remains almost constant from this point on .",
    "the luminosity is down to the cutoff luminosity , which we take to be @xmath78 erg s@xmath11 , three times less than the slowly decaying present luminosity quoted by rea et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a distance of 2 kpc , and consistent with the standard cooling luminosity range of neutron stars at ages of @xmath79 y. the choice of luminosity cutoff does not effect the evolution .",
    "the optical and infrared emission of the disk around 18 at present is much weaker than for other axps and sgrs .",
    "we expect luminosities in @xmath80 and 4.5 @xmath81 bands about @xmath82 and @xmath76 times less than the corresponding luminosities of 42 .",
    "the disk luminosity is even lower in the r band , since the magnetosphere truncates the inner disk of 18 .",
    "18 was spun down to its present period in an earlier epoch when the inner disk was within the light cylinder .",
    "the present state of exceedingly low spindown rate was reached when the disk retreated to or beyond the light cylinder .",
    "initial parameters @xmath83 g , @xmath84 to @xmath85 and @xmath86 ms work well , giving the period @xmath87 of 18 , consistently with the upper limit @xmath10 s s@xmath11 at ages greater than about @xmath88 years . for the present epoch with the disk inner edge at or beyond the light cylinder tracks with a sustained disk torque",
    "are shown , as well as evolution reduced to dipole spin - down .",
    "the luminosity is due to partial accretion until @xmath89 y. for simplicity we show only a reference luminosity calculated for full accretion ; the actual luminosity in this past epoch was smaller by an unknown fraction @xmath41 .",
    "the period @xmath90 = 9.1 s is reached as an eventual constant period , already at @xmath91 y , together with a drop in period derivative .    figures 1 and 2 show that the present @xmath20 upper limit gives a lower limit of @xmath92 y if the disk torque is still operating .",
    "if the disk is already out of contact with the star , the dipole spin - down track gives a lower limit of @xmath93 y. a future measurement of @xmath20 will give a rough estimate of the age , between this lower bound and the age at which the disk torque models give the observed @xmath20 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath94 s s@xmath11 will establish dipole spin - down prevails at present .",
    "an even lower @xmath20 measurement would signal dipole spin - down driven by @xmath95 g.    we conclude that the very low period derivative upper limit for 18 can be naturally explained in terms of spindown by a fallback disk .",
    "the neutron star has initial rotation period in the range expected for young neutron stars ( faucher - gigure & kaspi 2006 ) .",

    "indeed , the x - ray spectrum of 18 indicates a total surface field of 1.1 @xmath2 10@xmath96 g ( gver , g & zel 2011 ) . comparative investigation of total and surface dipole magnetic fields by different methods is likely to provide important clues to properties and evolution of magnetars , pulsars and young neutron stars .",
