    "the problem of accelerated expansion of the current universe seems to be one of the most fundamental problems of theoretical physics of the xxi century ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are several propositions of explanation of the observational fact that the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down .",
    "they involve the cosmological constant , time dependent vacuum energy , dynamical scalar field ( quintessence ) or modified friedmann equations @xcite .",
    "however , in all truth , we do not know what is causing the effect . while the proposition of the cosmological constant is an attractive idea from both the theoretical and observational point of view",
    ", it entails a crucial problem .",
    "why is its value , as measured by distant snia observations , so small when compared to the value obtained from the quantum field theory considerations ? neither",
    "do we understand why the dark energy density is of the same order of magnitude as the matter density during the present epoch .",
    "recently some new developments in dark energy studies were proposed .",
    "for example non - abelian einstein - born - infeld dilaton theory was explored @xcite , as well as cosmology based on its generalization @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we start form general relativity cosmological models with robertson  walker symmetry rather than euler s and poison s equations .",
    "we adopt the particle  like description of frw cosmologies @xcite which we extend to a general class of frw cosmologies with dark energy component parameterized by the scale factor ( or redshift ) .",
    "the main advantage of such formulation is that the one dimensional potential function contains the complete information about the dynamics .",
    "finally , we obtain a unified description of a large class of cosmological models in the notion of a particle moving in a one - dimensional potential well .",
    "hence , the evolution of the system can be naturally reduced to a simple @xmath0-dimensional dynamical system of the newtonian type .",
    "the problem of structural stability was studied by lazkoz in the context of cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "the ideas of rigidity and fragility of solutions are translated from the language of structural stability which was introduced by andronov and pontryagin @xcite .",
    "following lidsey @xcite the concepts of rigidity and fragility should be described through a condition on the functional form of the hubble function . in this paper",
    "we formulate the condition for structural stability in terms of the potential function rather than the hubble function .",
    "however , the simple relation between them makes the equivalence of this approaches .",
    "all attempts at cosmological modelling involve at the very beginning a large number of simplification and theoretical assumption regarding the parameters of the dark energy of unknown form .",
    "the question then arises whether such simple models are representing properties of real systems . usually , for dynamical systems to be viable as models they need to be structurally stable , i.e. their dynamics must preserve its qualitative characteristics under small perturbation @xcite .",
    "such a point of view resolves the `` approximation problem '' because our models of reality are , by definition , not precise , but might be very close to it",
    ". moreover , the structural stability framework can be useful from the methodological point of view because _ apriori _ we do not know the functional forms of dynamical systems . of course there is no objective reason to believe that all dynamical systems should be structurally stable . from the philosophical view of point , it is a presumption of convenience ( or economy ) .",
    "according to occam s razor , simple theories are more economical and mostly cases a little improvement of prediction is paid a very large increase in complexity of a model .",
    "to discriminate between different dark energy models , we postulate a simplicity principle that among all dynamical laws describing the cosmological evolution , the laws with the smallest complexity are chosen .",
    "it is interesting that occam s razor became a cornerstone of modern theory of induction @xcite .",
    "the notion of structural stability was discussed in the context of kaluza - klein theories @xcite . in this class of models",
    "it is required the existence of the mechanism of dynamical reduction of extra - dimensions , i.e. the configuration of frw @xmath2 \\{static internal space } should be an attractor .    in this paper",
    "we apply the structural stability notion as the discriminatory among the cosmological models with acceleration phase of expansion . in other words structural stability acting as occam s razor allows us to choose the simplest ( the @xmath1cdm or phantom cdm ) cosmological models with acceleration . from a physical view of point",
    "these two are two - phased models with decelerating matter - dominated phase and accelerating dark energy dominated phase .",
    "it is interesting that the strong energy condition @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( sec ) which determines qualitative dynamics of the frw cosmological models can be translated into the constraint on the potential function @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an elasticity coefficient which measures the logarithmic slope of the potential function with respect to the scale factor @xmath7 .",
    "the famous hawking - penrose singularity theorems invoke this condition @xcite .",
    "note that the null energy condition ( nec ) @xmath8 involving a derivative of the potential function can be formulated in an exact form @xmath9 the violation of the sec means that @xmath10 is a decreasing function of the scale factor .",
    "the violation of the nec denotes that in some region the diagram of the potential function is over the diagram of a parabola @xmath11 .",
    "the idea of obtaining a newtonian analogy to the frw cosmology within the framework of classical mechanics has been considered since the classical papers of milne and mccrea @xcite . in their formulation of the cosmological problem",
    "the fluid dynamics for a dust filled universe is applied but there arises a crucial difficulty because pressure @xmath12 does not play a dynamical role like in general relativity theory . as a consequence , there is no classical analogy of a radiation filled universe .",
    "if we assume the validity of the robertson - walker symmetry for our universe which is filled with perfect fluid satisfying the general form of the equation of state @xmath13 , then @xmath14 i.e. both the effective energy density @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 are parameterized by the scale factor as a consequence of the conservation condition @xmath17 where dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmological time @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the hubble function .    to unify two main approaches to explaining snia data , i.e. 1 ) dark energy , and 2 ) modification of frw equations , we generalize the acceleration equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants , rather than doing so for the first friedmann equation like in freese and lewis s approach .",
    "we assume that the universe is filled with standard dust matter ( together with dark matter ) and dark energy @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coefficient of the equation of state for dark energy parameterized by the scale factor or redshift @xmath26 .",
    "one can check that the raychaudhuri equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) can be rewritten to the form analogous to the newtonian equation @xmath27 if we choose the following form of the potential function @xmath10 @xmath28 where @xmath15 satisfies the conservation condition ( [ eq:1 ] ) . as the alternative method to obtain ( [ eq:5 ] )",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) with the help of conservation condition ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "if we put @xmath29 in formula ( [ eq:5 ] ) then we obtain the standard cosmology with dark energy .",
    "if we consider @xmath30 , @xmath31 , then the cardassian cosmology can be recovered provided that @xmath32 is assumed .",
    "the case of @xmath33 and @xmath34 represents a new exceptional case which appears as a consequence of the generalized raychaudhuri equation instead of the friedmann first integral which assumes the following form @xmath35 or @xmath36 where @xmath37 equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) is the form of the first integral of the einstein equation with robertson - walker symmetry called the friedmann energy first integral .",
    "formally , curvature effects as well as the cardassian term can be incorporated into the effective energy density @xmath38 .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) suggests a possible interpretation of the evolutional paths of cosmological models as the motion of a fictitious particle of unit mass in a one dimensional potential parameterized by the scale factor .",
    "following this interpretation the universe is accelerating in the domain of configuration space @xmath39 in which the potential is a decreasing function of the scale factor . in the opposite case ,",
    "if the potential is an increasing function of @xmath7 , the universe is decelerating .",
    "the limit case of zero acceleration corresponds to an extremum of the potential function .",
    "the energy conditions were also confronted with snia observations @xcite .",
    "it is shown that all energy conditions seem to have been violated in a recent past of evolution of the universe .",
    "it is useful to represent the evolution of the system in terms of dimensionless density parameters @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the present value of the hubble function .",
    "for this aims it is sufficient to introduce the dimensionless scale factor @xmath42 which measures the value of @xmath7 in the units of the present value @xmath43 , and parameterize the cosmological time following the rule @xmath44 .",
    "hence we obtain a @xmath0-dimensional dynamical system describing the evolution of cosmological models    [ eq:9 ] @xmath45    and @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "where @xmath48 @xmath49 for dust matter and quintessence matter satisfying the equation of state @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the form ( [ eq:9 ] ) of a dynamical system opens the possibility of adopting the dynamical systems methods in investigations of all possible evolutional scenarios for all possible initial conditions .",
    "theoretical research in this area has obviously shifted from finding and analyzing particular cosmological solution to investigating a space of all admissible solutions and discovering how certain properties ( like , for example , acceleration , existence of singularities ) are `` distributed '' in this space .",
    "the system ( [ eq:9 ] ) is a hamiltonian one and adopting the hamiltonian formalism to the admissible motion analysis seems to be natural .",
    "the analysis can then be performed in a manner similar to that of classical mechanics .",
    "the cosmology determines uniquely the form of the potential function @xmath52 , which is the central point of the investigations .",
    "different potential functions for different propositions of solving the acceleration problem are presented in table [ tab:1 ] and table [ tab:2 ] .",
    ".the potential functions for different dark energy models . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]    the key problem of this paper is to investigate the geometrical and topological properties of the multiverse of models of accelerating universes which we define in the following way    by multiverse of models of accelerating universes we understand the space of all @xmath0-dimensional systems of the newtonian type @xmath53 , @xmath54 with suitably defined potential function of the scale factor , which characterize the physical model of the dark energy or modification of the frw equation .",
    "the organization of the text is the following . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we investigate the property of structural stability of different subsets of multiverse .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to investigation of the inverse problem of accelerating cosmology  reconstruction of potential function from snia data and estimation of the value of transition redshift and hubble function at the moment of changing decelerating phase into accelerating one . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we distinguish generic accelerating models of the multiverse with the help of peixoto s theorem which characterize the structurally table systems on the compact two - dimensional phase plane defined on a two - dimensional poincar sphere . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we formulate the conclusions and examine the significance of the obtained results for the philosophical discussion over mcmullin s indifference principle , and the fine - tuning principle in the modern cosmological context .",
    "einstein s field equations constitute , in general , a very complicated system of nonlinear , partial differential equations , but what is made use of in cosmology are the solutions with prior symmetry assumptions postulated at the very beginning . in this case",
    ", the einstein field equations can be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equation , i.e. a dynamical system .",
    "hence , in cosmology the dynamical systems methods can be applied in a natural way .",
    "the applications of these methods allow to reveal some stability properties of particular solutions , visualized geometrically as trajectories in the phase space .",
    "hence , one can see how large the class of the solutions leading to the desired property is , by means of attractors and the inset of limit set ( an attractor is a limit set with an open inset  all the initial conditions that end up in some equilibrium state ) .",
    "the attractors are the most prominent experimentally , because of the probability for an initial state of the experiment to evolve asymptotically to the limit set being proportional to the volume of the inset .    the idea , now called structural stability , emerged in the history of dynamical investigations in the 1930 s with the writings of andronov , leontovich and pontryagin in russia ( the authors do not use the name structural stability but rather the name `` roughly systems '' )",
    "this idea is based on the observation that actual state of the system can never be specified exactly and application of dynamical systems might be useful anyway if it can describe features of the phase portrait that persist when state of the system is allowed to move around ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more comments ) .    among all dynamicists there is a shared prejudice that    1 .",
    "there is a class of phase portraits that are far simpler than arbitrary ones which can explain why a considerable portion of the mathematical physics has been dominated by the search for the generic properties .",
    "the exceptional cases should not arise very often in application and they de facto interrupt discussion ( classification ) @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the physically realistic models of the world should posses some kind of structural stability because to have many dramatically different models all agreeing with observations would be fatal for the empirical methods of science @xcite .    in cosmology a property ( for example acceleration ) is believed to be physically realistic if it can be attributed to generic subset of the models within a space of all admissible solutions or if it possesses a certain stability , i.e. if it is shared by a `` epsilon perturbed model '' .",
    "for example g.  f.  r. ellis formulates the so called probability principle `` the universe model should be the one that is a probable model '' within the set of all universe models and a stability assumption which states that `` the universe should be stable to perturbations '' @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to define    1 .   a space of states and their equivalence , 2 .   a perturbation of the system .",
    "the dynamical system is called structurally stable if all its @xmath55-perturbations ( sufficiently small ) have an epsilon equivalent phase portrait .",
    "therefore for the conception of structural stability we consider a @xmath55 perturbation of the vector field determined by right hand sides of the system which is small ( measured by delta ) .",
    "we also need a conception of epsilon equivalence .",
    "this has the form of topological equivalence  a homeomorphism of the state space preserving the arrow of time on each trajectory . in the definition of structural stability",
    "consider only deformation of the `` rubber sheet '' type stretches or slides of the phase space by a small amount measured by epsilon .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates the property of structural stability of a single spiral attractor ( focus ) and saddle point , and the structural instability of center .",
    "the addition of a delta perturbation pointing outward ( no matter how week ) results in a point repellor .",
    "we call such a system structurally unstable because phase portrait of the center and focus are not topologically equivalent ( note that all phase curves around the center are closed in contrast to the focus ) .",
    "hence one can claim that the pendulum system ( without friction ) is structurally unstable .",

    "peixoto s theorem @xcite states that structurally stable dynamical systems form open and dense subsets in the space of all dynamical systems defined on the compact manifold .",
    "this theorem is a basic characterization of the structurally stable dynamical systems on the plane which offers the possibility of an exact definition of generic ( typical ) and non - generic ( exceptional ) cases ( properties ) employing the notion of structural stability .",
    "unfortunately , there are no counterparts of this theorem in more dimensional cases when structurally unstable systems can also form open and dense subsets . for our aims",
    "it is important that peixoto s theorem can characterize generic cosmological models in terms of the potential function .    while there is no counterpart of peixoto s theorem in higher dimensions , it is easy to test whether a planar polynomial system has a structurally stable global phase portrait .",
    "in particular , a vector field on the poincar sphere will be structurally unstable if there is a non - hyperbolic critical point at infinity or if there is a trajectory connecting saddles on the equator of the poincar sphere @xmath57 .",
    "in opposite case if additionally the number of critical points and limit cycles is finite , @xmath58 is structurally stable on @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "let us introduce the following definition    if the set of all vector fields @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) having a certain property contains an open dense subset of @xmath63 , then the property is called generic .    from the physical point of view",
    "it is interesting to known whether a certain subset @xmath64 of @xmath63 ( representing the class of cosmological accelerating models in our case ) contains a dense subset because it means that this property ( acceleration ) is typical in @xmath64 ( see fig .",

    "it is not difficult to establish some simple relation between the geometry of the potential function and localization of the critical points and its character for the case of dynamical systems of the newtonian type :    1 .",
    "the critical points of the systems under consideration @xmath53 , @xmath65 lie always on the @xmath66 axis , i.e. they represent static universes @xmath67 , @xmath68 ; 2 .   the point @xmath69 is a critical point of the newtonian system iff it is a critical point of the potential function @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the total energy of the system @xmath72 ; @xmath73 for the case of flat models and @xmath74 in general ) ; 3 .",

    "if @xmath69 is a horizontal inflection point of the @xmath52 , it is a cusp ; 6 .",
    "the phase portraits of the newtonian type systems have reflectional symmetry with respect to the @xmath75 axis , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "all these properties are simple consequences of the hartman - grobman theorem which states that near the non - degenerate critical points ( hyperbolic ) the original dynamical system is equivalent to its linear part .",
    "therefore the character of a critical point is determined by the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix given by a simple equation @xmath78 , where @xmath79_{(x_{0},0)}\\ ] ] is the linearization matrix .",
    "hence , in the case of a maximum we obtain a saddle with @xmath80 , @xmath81 real of opposite signs , and if the potential function assumes a minimum at the critical point we have a center with @xmath82 purely imaginary of mutually conjugate .",
    "therefore , among all distinguished cases , only if the potential function admits a local maximum at the critical point we have a structurally stable global phase portrait . because @xmath83 and @xmath84 the universe is decelerating if the strong energy condition is satisfied and accelerating if the strong energy condition is violated",

    "we find a single critical point of the center type . because the presence of a critical point of non - hyperbolic type , the system is structurally unstable .",
    "the motion of the system is determined in the domain of the configuration space @xmath87 , i.e. for @xmath88 in the case presented on the figure .",
