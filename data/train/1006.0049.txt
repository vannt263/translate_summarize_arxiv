    "in this work we study global dynamical properties of reeb flows associated to tight contact forms on @xmath1 . recall that a @xmath2-form @xmath3 on a @xmath0-manifold is a contact form if @xmath4 never vanishes .",
    "the reeb vector field @xmath5 is uniquely determined by the equations @xmath6 and its flow @xmath7 is called the reeb flow .",
    "the associated contact structure is the @xmath8-plane distribution @xmath9 an overtwisted disk is an embedded disk @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the contact structure is called tight if there are no overtwisted disks .",
    "we abuse the terminology and say that @xmath3 is tight in this case . as an example , the form @xmath13 on @xmath14 with coordinates @xmath15 restricts to a contact form on @xmath1 , and a result of bennequin states that @xmath16 is tight . if @xmath17 is smooth then the same is obviously true for @xmath18 and , by a deep theorem of eliashberg , these are precisely the tight contact forms on @xmath1 , up to diffeomorphism .",
    "the reeb flow associated to @xmath18 is equivalent to the hamiltonian flow on a star - shaped energy level inside @xmath14 equipped with its canonical symplectic structure @xmath19 .",
    "we look for disks that are global sections in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath3 be a contact form on @xmath20 . a disk - like global surface of section for the reeb dynamics associated to @xmath3 is an embedded disk @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is a closed reeb orbit , @xmath23 is transversal to the reeb vector field and all reeb trajectories in @xmath24 hit @xmath23 infinitely often forward and backward in time .",
    "it is our purpose to investigate the following + * question : * given a tight contact form on @xmath1 , which closed reeb orbits are the boundary of some disk - like global surface of section for the associated reeb flow ? + if a reeb orbit is the boundary of a disk which is a global section then it must be unknotted and linked to all other closed orbits . also , it must satisfy certain contact - topological restrictions since it bounds a disk transversal to the reeb vector field .",
    "this last piece of information is encoded in the self - linking number . moreover , in the non - degenerate case , the flow must `` twist '' enough with respect to the disk , forcing certain restrictions on the linearized dynamics along the reeb orbit , which are encoded in its conley - zehnder index . for the precise statement of these necessary conditions",
    "see theorem  [ main1 ] below .",
    "we need to consider systems of disk - like global sections as follows .",
    "an open book decomposition - manifold @xmath25 is a pair @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a link , and @xmath28 is a fibration such that each fiber @xmath29 is the interior of a compact embedded surface @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 .",

    "then @xmath34 bounds a disk - like global section for the reeb flow if , and only if , @xmath34 is unknotted , its conley - zehnder index @xmath35 is greater than or equal to @xmath0 , @xmath34 has self - linking number @xmath36 and all periodic orbits @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 are linked to  @xmath34 . in this case , there exists an open book decomposition with disk - like pages of @xmath1 adapted to @xmath3 with binding @xmath39 .    in the statement above a reeb orbit",

    "the proof of sufficiency of the above conditions on @xmath34 is based on the theory of pseudo - holomorphic curves in symplectizations , as introduced by hofer in his ground - breaking work  @xcite .",
    "there are two main steps .",
    "first , we use disk - filling methods as in  @xcite to obtain finite - energy planes asymptotic to @xmath34 from a bishop family of disks with boundary on a suitable disk @xmath48 spanning @xmath34 .",
    "the necessary compactness for this analysis comes from the linking assumptions between @xmath34 and the orbits with index @xmath8 , we explain .",
    "if the bishop family breaks before producing a plane we get a punctured pseudo - holomorphic disk with boundary on @xmath48 , all its punctures are negative and asymptotic to reeb orbits with conley - zehnder index @xmath49 .",
    "if one orbit has index @xmath50 then the fredholm index at the punctured disk becomes negative and , consequently , all asymptotic orbits have index @xmath8 when the almost complex structure is generic . by",
    "standard intersection arguments the obtained orbits can not be linked to @xmath34 .",
    "this shows that the bishop family does not brake before it approaches @xmath51 . in a second step",
    "we prove that the bishop family can be forced to produce planes with very `` fast '' exponential decay .",
    "this decay implies good embeddedness and regularity properties , see  @xcite .",
