    "our interpretation of the iso spectra of orion irc2 suggests that the 2545 @xmath0 m h@xmath2o spectrum originates in a region where the intrinsically strong lines couple efficiently to an intense continuum . in principle",

    "a complete grating scan from 2.445.3 @xmath0 m using the maximum spectral resolution sws06 observing mode was made on september 6 1997 ( revolution 660 ) centered at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , which is about 3@xmath13 w and 1@xmath13 s of the irc2 position quoted by downes et al .",

    "a further sws06 scan was made from 26.3 to 45.2 @xmath0 m in revolution 826 ( february 19 1998 ) with the long axis oriented at 165.79@xmath14 e of n. the sws beam includes both irc2 and bn , but not `` peak 1 '' or `` peak 2 '' of shocked h@xmath2 ( beckwith et al .  1978 ) .",
    "the resolving power of the iso  sws grating , @xmath19 , varies from about 10002500 , implying that the observed line profiles are not resolved and that little velocity information can be obtained to help disentangle the various components which are known to exist toward irc2 . for this reason , follow - up observations of a selection of h@xmath1o lines",
    "were obtained using the fabry - perot sws07 observing mode in revolutions 823 and 831 ( february 16 and 24 1998 ) .",
    "five 250 km s@xmath3 scans were made across each line .",
    "the resolving power is of order 30000 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath3 , and the aperture long axis was oriented at 164.14@xmath14 and 168.46@xmath14 e of n on the two dates .",
    "the aperture size is @xmath20 and @xmath21 for wavelengths below and above 26 @xmath0 m respectively . during the revolution",
    "831 observation the wavelength interval between 5.3 and 7.0 @xmath0 m was simultaneously scanned by the sws grating . within this region",
    "are several h@xmath2 lines ( 00 s(7 ) , s(6 ) and s(5 ) ) , and h@xmath2o solid state ice and h@xmath2o gas phase @xmath8=10 features .",
    "data reduction was carried out on the standard processed data file from the off line processing system ( olpv6.1.1 for revolution 660 and olpv6.3.2 for revolutions 823 , 826 and 831 ) , using standard routines within the sws interactive analysis package up to the auto analysis result ( aar ) stage .",
    "the dark current subtraction was performed interactively for the grating data , but not for the fp data .",
    "the most up - to - date calibration files available for wavelength , flux and relative spectral responsivity were used .",
    "even so , there is at least one instrumental artefact in our grating spectra , at 33 @xmath0 m , due to structure in the relative spectral response calibration file ( rsrf ) .    the high continuum flux encountered in band 4 of the sws grating ( 2945 @xmath0 m ) , and the finite response time of the detectors , led to significant memory and response effects near the band edges , at positions of important water and oh lines , and so necessitated a non - standard up - down scan correction .",
    "for the sws an `` up '' ( `` down '' ) scan proceeds toward increasing ( decreasing ) grating positions but decreasing ( increasing ) wavelengths . since the up scan precedes the down scan , in high flux cases it is usually the down scan which is deemed to have the more reliable spectral shape , since by that time the instrument has settled down .",
    "indeed , this was the case in the long - wavelength portion ( 4145 @xmath0 m ) of our spectra , so that the up scan was corrected to approximately the same shape as the down scan . on the other hand , the short - wavelength portion ( 2933 @xmath0 m ) of the down scan of our spectra had a peculiar concave shape , which did not match cleanly ( in terms of _ shape _ ) to band 3e , which in turn matched cleanly with band 3d .",
    "this was true for both the revolution 660 and 826 data sets . in this case therefore the down scan was corrected to have a similar shape to the up scan .",
    "the up - down correction obviously entailed splitting the band 4 data into two segments ( 2937 @xmath0 m and 3745 @xmath0 m ) , but this produced a more reliable spectral shape at both ends , e.g. allowing the continuum on either side of the 45.1 @xmath0 m water line to be determined , and the 28.940 and 28.914 @xmath0 m oh and h@xmath2o @xmath22 lines to be partially resolved .",
    "following the aar stage , further data processing , such as flatfielding , sigma clipping and rebinning , was performed using software in the sws ia package .",
    "for instance , for both the grating and fp cases the individual detector scans have been brought to a common flux level using an @xmath23 degree polynomial ( @xmath24 = 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 ) fit to a reference spectrum which may either be the median of the down scans ( e.g. grating band 3 ) , the median of both the up and down scans ( e.g. the up - down corrected grating band 4 ) , or the mean of all scans ( e.g. the fabry - perot data ) .",
    "the data have subsequently been sigma clipped such that any points lying more than 3 sigma outside of the average of all data within a bin of width equal to the theoretical spectral resolution have been discarded .",
    "the final step in producing a spectrum involves rebinning the much over - sampled data using the mean within a bin which is again equal to the theoretical resolution .    in the case of the 25.94 @xmath0 m fp scans",
    "it was observed that glitches and their associated tails , which had not been flagged as bad data by the pipeline , contributed significant noise to the final spectrum . in this instance",
    "an interactive glitch and tail correction was performed before flatfielding , sigma clipping and rebinning . as noted by schaeidt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and heras ( 1997 ) the photometric accuracies of the sws grating band 4 ( where most of our water detections occur ) and fabry - perot are 30% and 40% respectively .",
    "however , our observed line equivalent widths , being ratios of the line area over adjacent continuum , will be more accurate than this .",
    "the accuracy of the grating wavelength calibration is 1/101/5 of a resolution element , whilst that of the fabry - perot is of order 10@xmath25 @xmath0 m , or about 1 km s@xmath3 ( valentijn et al .",

    "in fig . 1 the sws grating spectrum in the 2545 @xmath0 m range is presented for the revolution 660 data , with the position and identification of features marked .",
    "the data consist of spectral segments from bands 3d , 3e and 4 , for which `` jumps '' in the flux were observed due to the different aperture sizes . however , for display purposes small shifts , of order a few thousand jy ( i.e. a few percent ) , have been applied to produce a continuous spectrum .",
    "clearly marked in fig .",
    "1 are 19 absorption lines arising from pure rotational levels in both the ortho- ( o ) and para- ( p ) species of h@xmath1o .",
    "in the few cases where the plot scale makes the line difficult to see in fig . 1 , we present close - ups in fig .",
    "the lines in this wavelength region originate from highly - excited states , with excitation energies of the lower levels @xmath26 k , and the upper levels up to 1200  k. the strongest absorptions come from levels belonging to the backbone of the energy ladder . among the highest levels seen",
    "is the upper state of the @xmath27 transition at 29.8367 @xmath0 m , involving the upper level ( @xmath28 ) of the well - known 22 ghz h@xmath2o maser line ( cheung et al .",
    "indeed , many of the levels from which absorption is seen are also upper levels of either known or suspected maser transitions ( neufeld & melnick 1991 ) .",
    "it is shown below based on velocity considerations that our lines probably arise in the same region where the masers are situated , indicating that our observations may form a useful data set for studying the maser pump mechanism .",
    "a sub - set of 5 of the 19 lines was chosen to be observed with the fabry - perot .",

    "( @xmath29 40.69 @xmath0 m ) and possibly a second ( @xmath30 43.89 @xmath0 m ) , two velocity components are detected , one in absorption and the other in emission .",
    "a modulation in the baselines , due to the tracking of the fabry - perot transmission function across the region of the peak of the grating instrumental profile , has been modelled in terms of two parameters , the grating spectral resolution and the shift between the two response functions .",

    "table 1 presents an overview of our observations for the revolution 660 data , including the rest wavelength , upper and lower levels , and equivalent widths @xmath31 in units of doppler velocity ( km s@xmath3 ) , where @xmath32 is the line equivalent width in wavelength units .",
    "the superscripts on @xmath33 refer to the observed and calculated equivalent widths , the latter derived from a generalised curve - of - growth analysis to be described in sect .",
    "table  1 also contains the results for three pure rotational oh lines detected in absorption in our spectra .",
    "all derived quantities were calculated from unshifted spectral segments .",
    "figure 4(a ) presents our results graphically , in the form of a standard population diagram ( goldsmith & langer 1999 ) , where the column density in the lower level has been determined using the formula @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the lower and upper levels , @xmath37 is the einstein @xmath38-coefficient in s@xmath3 and @xmath32 is the equivalent width .",
    "this formula is only strictly valid for optically thin lines , and under the assumption that the upper levels are not significantly populated .",
    "the error bars represent a 30% uncertainty , so that the scatter in the data is clearly larger than any systematic or statistical uncertainties .",
    "although there is a clear trend in the data , this scatter already hints that a more detailed analysis is required to obtain a reliable total h@xmath2o column density .",
    "such an analysis , in the form of a generalised curve - of - growth , is presented in sect .",
    "almost all lines listed in table 1 at 27.545.2 @xmath0 m are visible in both the revolution 660 and 826 spectra , and their measured equivalent widths agree within 30% in the majority of cases .",
    "4(a ) , where both data sets are presented graphically .",
    "we present only the revolution 660 data in table 1 because the data from that revolution are of a better quality , and also only 15 of the 19 lines were observed in revolution 826 due to the shorter wavelength scan range . the fact that the pure rotational h@xmath2o and oh lines observed with the sws occur in absorption is in strong contrast with the lines seen with the lws , which are mostly in emission ( e.g. , harwit et al .  1998 ) . since the lws lines arise in levels with similar excitation energies at wavelengths where the continuum flux is comparable to that in the sws range , this suggests that most of the mid - infrared continuum and h@xmath2o absorption originate in a small region of size comparable to the sws beam . in the almost order - of - magnitude larger area of the lws beam , even more of the absorption",
    "is probably filled in by large - scale emission from more extended , lower excitation shocked gas .",
    "the qualitative change in the character of the water spectrum is thus probably a result of effects of both geometry ( beam - filling ) and radiative transfer .",
    "the small differences in equivalent widths found from the grating and fabry - perot spectra are due to uncertainties in the calibration and varying beam shapes , which may couple differently to the complex source structure . the continuum radiation at 2545 @xmath0 m is produced by extended dust emission over a @xmath10 30@xmath13 region centered near irc2 , in contrast with the situation at @xmath39 @xmath0 m where bn dominates ( wynn - williams et al .  1984",
    ") . since h@xmath2o emission is observed on an arcmin scale with the lws ( e.g. cernicharo et al .",
    "1999a ) , it is likely that the h@xmath2o covers all of the continuum , at least for the lower - excitation lines .",
    "however , the absorption of the lower - lying lines may be partially filled in by emission within the sws beam . as discussed below",
    ", these effects must be taken into account explicitly in an analysis of the equivalent widths .",

    "subthermal excitation by collisions at densities below the critical densities of the observed levels ( @xmath144 @xmath145 ) can also result in excitation temperatures of order 50100  k , but this merely re - affirms that radiative processes probably dominate the excitation .",

    "this need not be true , and the analysis can include an additional correction factor for the coupling to the continuum .",
    "tests show that if the continuum intensity is thus changed by a factor of two in either direction , the derived total column density and mean excitation temperature change by less than 20% , which we take as our maximum uncertainty .",
    "we have also compared our observed line equivalent widths with those computed for the kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) c - shock in orion with a pre - shock density of 10@xmath149 @xmath145 and shock velocity of 37 km s@xmath3 ( kaufman & neufeld , private communication ) ( see table 1 ) . the water abundance ( with respect to h@xmath1 ) used in this shock calculation was 3.5@xmath7810@xmath25 , based on the o and c abundances of cardelli et al .",

    "the sws results may therefore be more sensitive to the low - velocity plateau gas identified by several authors ( e.g. genzel & stutzki 1989 ) , whereas the larger lws beam will include a significant contribution from the high - velocity gas .",
    "we also note that water line emission in the kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) shock models is for many lines insensitive to the shock velocity , especially when the velocity is @xmath152 1520 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is presumably because in such cases the water abundance has reached its maximum value and that the gas temperature is well above the upper levels involved .",
    "therefore , the emission depends more on density and not temperature ( which in turn is highly sensitive to the shock velocity ) .",
    "even so , future attempts to match both the harwit et al . lines and our detections with a slower shock , but including radiative excitation , will be worthwhile .",
    "a long standing problem in shock research is the contribution of water to the total gas cooling behind the shock , and it is pertinent to mention it here .",
    "unfortunately , the situation in orion irc2 , i.e. a high water abundance ( see sect .",
    "4.3 ) coupled with an intense mid- and far - infrared radiation field , has not previously been considered in shock models .",
    "however , the detection of all our transitions in absorption raises the interesting possibility that at least these transitions are not cooling the gas , but rather heating it .",
    "such heating results from the water molecules absorbing the radiation and thereby being raised to excited states .",
    "the excess energy may then be imparted to the gas through collisional de - excitation with other molecules , e.g. h@xmath2 , as in the scenario proposed by takahashi et al .",
    ". this would of course be in competition with radiative de - excitation ( i.e. cooling ) , and is therefore density dependent .",
    "further , takahashi et al . ( 1983 ) and neufeld et al . (",
    "1995 ) state that a necessary condition for h@xmath2o heating is that the dust temperature is greater than the gas temperature .",
    "a full scale shock model , taking into account all transitions , would be required to determine if there was net heating or cooling .",
    "we merely mention it here as an interesting aside , and direct the reader to the paper by harwit et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a full discussion of the water cooling contribution in orion .",
    "briefly though , from their larger beam lws observations they find that h@xmath2o and co contribute similar amounts to the overall cooling , but both are only about a tenth of the total h@xmath2 cooling . on the other hand , saraceno et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , in a study of a sample of shock sources , find that co cooling typically dominates over h@xmath2o by a factor of several .      in order to determine an h@xmath2o abundance directly from our data , information on the h@xmath2 column density",
    "is needed . as noted above , from the h@xmath2 lines detected elsewhere in our spectra ( van dishoeck et al .",

    "this temperature of @xmath10150 k is likely to be indicative of the kinetic temperature , @xmath160 , at this position , since the density of @xmath15210@xmath149 @xmath145 ( e.g. genzel & stutzki 1989 ) is above the critical density of the h@xmath2 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) transitions ( e.g. le bourlot et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although this estimate of @xmath160 is at a different position than where the water absorption line detections were made , wright ( 1999 ) shows that in at least 3 shock sources , including orion , the excitation temperature determined from pure rotational h@xmath2 lines ( @xmath161=37 ) is quite invariant across the sources , as is the column density .",

    "<S> because the continuum is intense and likely formed in or near the water - containing gas , the excitation of the observed transitions is dominated by radiative processes . a simple , generalised curve - of - growth method is presented and used to analyze the data . </S>",
    "<S> a mean excitation temperature of 72 k and a total h@xmath2o column density of @xmath4 @xmath5 are inferred , each with an estimated maximum uncertainty of 20% . combined with the h@xmath2 column density derived from iso observations of the pure rotational h@xmath2 lines , and an assumed temperature of 200350 k , </S>",
