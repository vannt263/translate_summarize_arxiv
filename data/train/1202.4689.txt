    "it is very timely to continue to explore the acceleration of the universe @xcite , as its discovery has very recently finally gathered the top recognition of the community .",
    "the question of whether such evolution is produced by a dark energy component or rather a manifestation of bold unknown physics remains one of the most puzzling topics in cosmology @xcite .",
    "assuming the dark energy scenario , and beyond theoretical questioning about its physical nature , it is most vital to learn to extract the best and most relevant information from current astronomical data .",
    "many methods are strongly tied to the assumption of a background cosmological model or , equivalently , of an analytical dark energy equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "such is precisely the case of the reconstruction of the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , which provided the first evidence for the acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "the diagram presents the corresponding distance modulus at different redhsifts and is computed from the eos itself after a convenient integration in redshift .",
    "variations of this procedure apply as well when considering other observational tests such as gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "but even though biases on final results may depend on the previously described assumptions , that route , and in particular giving a specific prescription of the eos is still the most popular data analysis method , as opposed to model independent methods ( eos free prescriptions ) for the reconstruction of dark energy .",
    "fortunately , literature sources about this alternative way to explore the accelerated universe have mounted considerably , and thus the state of the art has turned promising @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors present a different approach to this model independent reconstruction : the dimensionless coordinate distance and its first and second order derivatives with respect to redshift are reconstructed using a polynomial fit inside an appositely designed redshift window .",
    "the only underlying assumption is a description of the universe by a generic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "moreover , the method does not depend on the physical properties of the components of the universe or on the underlying gravity theory .",
    "the latter is an aspect to be considered only at a second stage , when one attempts at the derivation of the behavior of more interesting and observable cosmological quantities : the dimensionless expansion rate @xmath0 , the universe acceleration ( through the well known deceleration parameter @xmath1 ) , or finally the dark energy eos parameter @xmath2 . as usual , here @xmath3 is the scale factor , the dots denote derivatives with respect to cosmological time , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the dark energy pressure and density .    in this work we aim at a thorough and novel study of a number of main aspects of this problem .",
    "firstly , observational samples are updated , and results with @xcite are compared , as far as possible .",
    "this lets us verify that , opposite to what one could expect _ in principle _ , conclusions in general are strongly related to the way observational samples have been built on .",
    "this is not , thus , a caveat of the reconstruction method , and could rather be useful at a first observational level so as to discern the requirements a sample needs to be useful for the inference of information about dark energy .",
    "secondly , the validity of grbs in the context of this method is checked .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that these data can be a promising tool to study cosmology at high redshifts . in this",
    "regard , our results seem to hint that grbs are not as compelling as desirable , and probably the reasons for this are intrinsic to the nature of actual grbs observables .",
    "this is in agreement with the critical view in @xcite .",
    "after this , it is argued that the analysis in the model independent spirit of @xcite requires adjusting some parameters .",
    "but typically , this causes noise and large errors in some regimes ( this seems to be intrinsically related to the procedure itself ) .",
    "thus , the following questions arise quite naturally : how can the real cosmological information be _ read off _ from these noisy patterns ? and how and when can the goodness and closeness to reality of the reconstructed profiles be ascertained ?    at the next stage , we move on to explore the range of application of the method and compare it with the results obtained using a specific dark energy eos . at the same time , we investigate how physically relevant parameters depend on the errors and noise of data .",
    "finally , we conclude that this method just provides an idea of the global trend of the parameters .",
    "the large correlation among them does not allow to obtain independent measures .",
    "but , on the other hand , it is admissible to report values associated with independent redshift bins .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we revise the method in its main aspects ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we briefly describe the observational tools chosen for the analysis , namely the sneia and grbs samples with their properties ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the main results both for real and mock data ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : binning ] we present results from the binning approach ; and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the most important results .",
    "the use of sneia and grbs makes us focus mainly on the distance modulus @xmath6 , which is an observable quantity defined as @xmath7 + \\mu_0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the luminosity distance ( see below ) , the nuisance parameter @xmath9 encodes the absolute magnitude @xmath10 of any sneia and the hubble constant @xmath11 ( the current value of the expansion rate ) . for convenience , the speed of light has been set to one , and this choice will apply to the whole paper .    in full rigour ,",
    "though , a proper model - independent analysis of the grbs data can not be based on the grbs distance modulus , which is not directly observable and depends on the cosmology assumed @xcite . as we will discuss in [ sec : grbsdata ] , we have used a grbs sample whose calibration is independent of the cosmological model and is based on the use of sneia as calibration tools .",
    "the luminosity distance can be written as @xmath12 where the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath13 reads explicitly @xmath14 the determination of the coordinate distances from the underlying observational data typically proceeds under the assumption of a cosmological model , which reflects in the analytical expression of @xmath15 , the dimensionless expansion rate .",
    "the method developed in @xcite does not require any assumption on the cosmological model , or on the expression of the dark energy functional .",
    "it is possible though to determine @xmath13 in a model independent way .",
    "then , as determining the hubble function @xmath16 , and deceleration parameter @xmath17 only involves the computation of the derivatives of @xmath13 , those two quantities of interest inherit the model independence .",
    "the method was developed by @xcite and follows a series of steps which we describe in the next subsection .      * _ step 1 .",
    "_ * the input data needed are the collection of @xmath18 , quantities , where the index @xmath19 ranges from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( the number of objects in the chosen dataset ) .",
    "let us describe those quantities one by one .",
    "clearly , the @xmath22 are the redshifts for the dataset objects . then , the @xmath23 denote the coordinate distance data values obtained from the observational quantities ( as the observed variable is @xmath24 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : modulus ] )  -  ( [ eq : l_distance ] ) have to be combined to give the @xmath25 ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath26 represent the coordinate distance errors .",
    "contributions to this last quantities will come both from errors on @xmath27 and from errors on the redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "the sample we have used was not presented with errors on the redshifts , but using old dataset values , we have verified that the redshift contribution from those errors is always negligible when compared to the contribution from the errors in the @xmath27 .    *",
    "_ * we define a redshift grid with the values @xmath28 , and at each of them we evaluate the coordinate distances , their derivatives and the related cosmological quantities .",
    "the properties of this grid are completely arbitrary , but we have checked this does not affect final results ; in our case the grid will range from @xmath29 until the maximum redshift @xmath30 reached by the chosen dataset , with an homogeneous spacing of @xmath31 .    * _ step 3 .",
    "_ * finally , we have to perform a weighted polynomial fit of @xmath32 , with the inverse errors @xmath33 as statistical weights .",
    "the fit is not , though , a global one .",
    "we rather do a number of individual fits in separate redshift windows defined by a length @xmath34 and a center @xmath35 . for each fit",
    "just those data points falling in each window are taken , and the central redshift moves iteratively along the grid values @xmath28 .",
    "at both ends of each window , we apply in addition a gaussian tapered region with dispersion @xmath36 and extending out to @xmath37 .",
    "this makes all the points in this region have their weights reduced by the value of the gaussian wing at that point . this way , fluctuations and discontinuities are controlled when moving from one window to another .",
    "then the fit is performed after changing the variables from @xmath22 to @xmath38 , so that the coordinate distance values and its derivatives at @xmath39 are simply the values of the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated in @xmath40 .",
    "for example , when using a second order polynomial : @xmath41 we will have @xmath42 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath43 ( or , equivalently , to redshift , in this case ) .",
    "all the cosmological quantities depend on combinations of the respective @xmath44 , and the errors can be easily evaluated by straightforward application of error propagation theory .",
    "the method described in the previous subsection produces a set of @xmath45 polynomial - reconstructed dimensionless coordinate distance values with their first and second order derivatives values ( here @xmath45 is an integer depending on the redshift grid range and spacing ) .",
    "this allows giving the next step in the reconstruction .    assuming an frw metric and no contribution from spatial curvature , one can easily obtain estimations for more cosmologically interesting quantities .",
    "one of them is the expansion rate , which from eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordinate_distance ] ) is easily derivable to be @xmath46 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to redshift .",
    "likewise , the deceleration is given by @xmath47 this expression is obviously valid for any cosmological scenario based on an homogeneous and isotropic expansion .",
    "if we now also assume a theory of gravity ( in this case general relativity ) , we can use the friedmann equations : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass - energy density of non - relativistic matter , @xmath51 is the mass - energy density of the dark energy , and @xmath52 is the pressure of dark energy .",
    "it is straightforward to derive from them the expression of the dark energy equation of state @xmath53 . using the standard definition of the critical density at the present epoch , @xmath54",
    ", the dark energy pressure can be shown to be @xmath55\\\\ & = & \\rho_{0,c } \\left [ - ( y')^{-2 } \\left ( 1 + \\frac{2}{3 } ( 1+z ) \\frac{y''}{y ' } \\right ) \\right]\\ ; ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the dark energy density is @xmath56 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the fractional contribution of non - relativistic matter to the critical density at zero redshift , and the term @xmath58 defines its time evolution . then",
    ", as the dark energy eos parameter @xmath59 is defined as the ratio of the dark energy pressure to density , @xmath60 , it finally results in the expression @xmath61}{1-\\omega_m(1+z)^{3}(y')^{2 } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] note that @xmath62 is clearly involved in the determination of the @xmath59 parameter and of its related error ; here we use the value corresponding to the wcdm+sz+lens case from wmap7-year @xcite , which has @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , this particular choice does not have a strong impact in the conclusions to be reached .    to close this section",
    "let us mention that errors on all the previous quantities are of course derived from errors from @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 applying the usual error propagation rules .",
    "our main reconstruction tool is one of the most recent type ia supernovae sample available , the union2 sample described in @xcite .",
    "this compilation is the result of a new dataset of low - redshift nearby - hubble - flow sneia and is built with new analysis procedures suitable for working with several heterogeneous sneia compilations .",
    "it includes the union data set from @xcite with six added sneia first presented in @xcite , along with sneia from @xcite , the low - z and the intermediate - z data from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "after the application of various selection cuts to create a homogeneous and high signal - to - noise data set , @xmath67 sneia events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath68 were obtained .",
    "the use of the union2 sneia data rests on the definition of the distance modulus as given above .",
    "given the heterogeneous origin of this dataset , and the procedures described in @xcite for reducing data , it turns out we need to fix the value of @xmath69 for converting the modulus distance @xmath70 to the coordinate distance @xmath13 .",
    "one way would be using just low redshift sneia to find the best fit value for @xmath11 starting from the approximate expression valid for this range , @xmath71 ; alternatively , one could assume an independent measurement of the same quantity , as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have chosen a different way to proceed : as we will try to compare results from sneia with results from grbs , choosing the same unique value for @xmath11 makes sense , even though it is not fundamental for the final results .",
    "for this reason , as the grbs calibration has been done assuming a well fixed value of @xmath72 ( km / s)/mpc @xcite , we have decided to use the same value of @xmath11 for the sneia ( which at the same time we have tested to give a very good fit to the hubble diagram of sneia at low redshifts ) .",
    "working out and interpreting results from a grbs analysis is not an easy task , as the errors on their observable quantities are much larger than those for sneia , besides the fact their source mechanism is still not well understood .",
    "for this reason , choosing a good grbs sample is crucial ; we have chosen to work with the sample described in @xcite . there",
    "the authors performed a new calibration procedure on the widely used grbs sample from @xcite , which matches perfectly some of the requirements in this paper .",
    "the possibility of a comparison between sneia and grbs is strictly related to the building of a hubble diagram for grbs too , which is an extremely difficult task because grbs are not standard candles , unlike sneia . to create an hubble diagram for grbs",
    ", one has to look for a correlation between a distance dependent quantity and a directly observable property .",
    "starting from some of the many correlations that have been suggested not long ago , in @xcite the authors created a sample of 69 grbs in the redshift range @xmath73 for which the hubble diagram is well settled .",
    "then , in @xcite that sample was updated in many aspects , the main one being the test of a new method for the calibration of grbs based on the non assumption of a priori cosmological model",
    ". such a model independent calibration is built on the idea that sneia and grbs at the same redshift should exhibit the same distance modulus . in this way",
    ", interpolating the sneia hubble diagram gives the value of @xmath24 for a sub - sample of grbs which lies in the same redshift range .",
    "this sub - sample can be finally used to calibrate the well known grbs correlations and , assuming that this calibration is redshift independent , it can be extended to high redshift grbs . with this procedure ,",
    "in @xcite the authors were able to convert the @xcite sample to a new one , with the same number of objects but with sneia - calibrated grbs distance moduluss .",
    "we remind that the main objective of this kind of approach is not to obtain independent measurements of coordinate distances and their related quantities , but rather to find out the global trends underlying the data .",
    "more exactly , we aim to specify a possible way of proceeding for optimizing the use of this approach .",
    "in particular , we will examine the effects produced by changes in the fitting windows which should enable to detect and distinguish _ global _ and _ local _ trends .    on the one hand ,",
    "as it is well known , using larger fitting windows leads to more robust fits , as more points are included in the analysis ; but , at the same time , a strong correlation arises among the various values one obtains , as the fitting windows clearly overlap .    on the other hand ,",
    "using narrower fitting windows , makes it possible to find local ( in a redshift sense ) properties of the global trend , and with more redshift resolution .",
    "the negative counterpart is that smaller windows also imply working with fewer data points , and this accentuates noisy features in the estimated parameters .",
    "if one assumes implicitly the physically reasonable hypothesis that the coordinate distance @xmath13 is a smooth function of redshift ( as one does in this kind of approach ) , then one can compare large ( global ) and small ( local ) fitting windows results .",
    "in that way , one can explore the global trend and the characteristics that depend on local irregularities coming from , for example , mixing heterogeneous sub - samples , even if they are treated appropriately , as is the case of the union2 sample , or containing intrinsic and physically important information about the universe dynamics . by comparing results from large and small fitting windows",
    ", one can detect more clearly reconstruction features due to the limitations of the method rather than to an intrinsical relation to the physics dynamics . in this work we study which is the best range to obtain this information , and we also gather some further understanding about the limits of the method presented : we basically conclude the limits depend on the characteristics of the datasets and the specifications of the fitting windows . we have also performed an independent binning sketch , which has consisted in dividing the data points into a number of bins which do not overlap , and obtaining independent estimations of the required parameters afterwards .      to avoid misunderstandings , let it be clear that there are a number of facts that preclude a very close comparison of our results with those in @xcite . to begin with , our sneia sample has two main differences with respect to the samples used in @xcite .",
    "first of all , the sample we consider is made up of @xmath74 objects as opposed to the @xmath75 in davis dataset .",
    "this mainly implies a higher mean number density for the data points which should translate into a better knowledge of the global tendency of the parameters under study .",
    "this newer sample displays a quite larger number density for @xmath76 , but no considerable changes occur for higher redshifts values , so one still has to be careful about conclusions based on the results in this range .",
    "second , the sample we use is made of different heterogeneous sneia sub - samples and , even though data reduction has reduced differences considerably , it is possible that those disparities influence the local properties of our derived quantities .",
    "a quite important new point in our analysis is that we have noticed that some remarkable oscillations that arise at some levels of the reconstruction are not directly due to the fitting algorithm , but mainly related to the presence of sneia with a high relative error .",
    "to back up this view , we produced a cut version of the total union2 data sample by deleting all the data points whose error was larger than @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the mean of the data error distribution and @xmath79 is its standard deviation . with this procedure we cut @xmath80 points ( all having in common a high relative error ) and the oscillatory ( noisy ) features disappeared .",
    "we performed different runs changing both the length of the fitting windows , @xmath34 , and the dispersion @xmath36 of the gaussian tapered region needed for calculating the fit weights .",
    "we regarded as good results just those obtained when the number of data - points inside any fitting window and out of the gaussian tapered region ( i.e. with unchanged error weight ) was @xmath81 , so to assure a minimal sufficient number of data points as compared to the number of fitting parameters .",
    "our choice is slightly stricter than the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "c , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 from a polynomial analysis with a wmap7 @xmath86cdm ( @xmath87 , solid line ) and with a wmap7 ( @xmath88 wmap7.2 ) quiessence model ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , dashed line).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    ( ) +   +    , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 from a polynomial analysis with a wmap7 @xmath86cdm ( @xmath87 , solid line ) and with a wmap7 ( @xmath88 wmap7.2 ) quiessence model ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , dashed line).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    ( ) +   +    , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 from a polynomial analysis with a wmap7 @xmath86cdm ( @xmath87 , solid line ) and with a wmap7 ( @xmath88 wmap7.2 ) quiessence model ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , dashed line).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    ( ) +   +    fig .",
    "[ fig : ddcomparison](a ) shows a reconstruction of @xmath64 derived from a fit with @xmath91 and a dispersion @xmath92 of the gaussian tapered region ( i.e. the same values used in @xcite and regarded there as the _ best _ ones ) .",
    "the trend is clearly very smooth and quite similar to the one in @xcite ; all in all , it can be considered as an admirably good reconstruction .",
    "we detect , though , that for redshifts @xmath93 there is a slight difference between the reconstructed dimensionless coordinate distance and the theoretically expected one ( derived using some updated cosmological models from @xcite with respect to the one used in @xcite ) , with a systematic lower trend at high redshifts . given the location ( redshift range ) of the deviation , we believe it can put be down to the low number density of sneia points in this region .",
    "the reconstruction of the first order derivative of dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath65 is clearly less satisfactory .",
    "we plot it in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddcomparison](b ) using the same redshift range as for the corresponding figure in @xcite .",
    "both studies display in a broad sense similar irregularities for @xmath94 , but a rise at high redshifts occurs in our case ; it is either a hint of a possible systematics in the way high redshift data have been obtained , or it is rather a natural consequence of the low number of data points per bin used in the interpolation , or just a mixture of those such problems .",
    "no way of disentangle the two effects is possible at this level .",
    "if we compare this trend in @xmath65 with the results about @xmath64 , it follows immediately that the redshift range where @xmath65 rises is the same where @xmath64 deviates more from the theoretical expectations .",
    "we underline that the theoretical expectations ( plotted in the same figures ) are only considered as a possible comparison term and a tool for detecting possible local or global properties of the underlying trend .",
    "their use does not mean they are considered important as a fiducial cosmological model .    for what concerns the second order derivative , @xmath66 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ddcomparison](c ) , we clearly observe a very noisy behavior at redshift @xmath95 .",
    "this quantity seems more sensitive to oscillations in the number density in sneia sample .",
    "we reach this conclusion because while @xcite this trend looks quite homogeneous , in our reconstruction it is more accentuated so we are tempted to put it down to the heterogeneous nature of the union2 sample .",
    "thus , even though we are working with a larger sneia sample , error bars are quite comparable and , in our case , even larger at high redshift .",
    "so , the first lesson one can derive is that denser and larger ( in a number data point sense ) samples might not improve the use of the model independent reconstruction method we are analyzing .",
    "this can be seen as a limitation of the method itself , and in [ sec : mock ] we look deeper into this problem .",
    "continuing with our analysis , we have also considered differences arising from the use of different window width values .",
    "after several preliminary tests , we have eventually considered as representative results from @xmath91 ( which is the width used in @xcite ) , and from another two widths : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .      as we are working with a data set that contains a statistically significant number of objects , one may be tempted to try and improve the analysis by using smaller redshift windows for the fit , as , _ in principle _ , one would still have a sufficient number of points .",
    "this is , however , not true mainly due to the non uniformity of redshift distribution of our sneia sample .",
    "we have a large number of objects at small redshifts but too few points are at high redshifts , and this makes the noisy trends and the errors grow in this range .",
    "it is thus not surprising that more stringent constraints on our derived quantities at large redshifts can not be obtained .",
    "moreover , when the fitting window width becomes smaller , the _ extremal _ intervals ( i.e. intervals at very low and high redshift ) become precisely the most problematic cases .",
    "we can see this in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters2p](e ) by paying attention to the case of the reconstructed @xmath66 .",
    "note that the errors get minimal in the mid redshift range , but then grow again for low ( large number of data points ) and high ( small number of data points ) redshifts . on broad terms , at low redshifts the number of datapoints in typical windows is high , and so we have small noisy oscillations and biased estimations of the reconstructed parameters , but estimations also depend on the gaussian tapered region dispersion , @xmath98 .",
    "in contrast at high redshifts , few points will be found in our window , and constraints are poor : many oscillations and large error bars occur .",
    "on the other hand , taking into account that our main goal is to guess the global trend of our parameters , we considered a somehow completely opposite approach .",
    "specifically , we studied the effect of enlarging the fitting window as much as possible so as to detect a global and unified trend of the data ( even though this would cause overlaps in the fitting windows and a related growth in the correlation ) .",
    "we detected that large fitting windows give very smooth trends , mainly because the data are , in some measure _ averaged_. but at the same time these results are strongly biased ( as already reported by @xcite ) , because the polynomial fit describes very poorly the general trend of our quantities . more specifically , a second or third order polynomial can fit _ very well _ the dimensionless coordinate distance in the redshift range depicted by data , but it would give strongly unphysical trends when extended to higher ( out of sample ) redshifts as , for example , a negative coordinate distance .",
    "for this reason , we do not present here cases with widths wider that @xmath97 , because this is the largest amplitude for which such a bias has a negligible effect on our reconstructed quantities .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tabresult ]    results obtained with this approach are presented in figs .  [ fig : hbin ]  -  [ fig : wbin ] and in table  [ tabresult ] . for @xmath16 the binned approach",
    "is well behaved , and the results agree with those presented in @xcite . however , for the dark energy eos parameter @xmath59 and acceleration parameter @xmath17 , we obtain large uncertainties when the number of bins is large .",
    "nevertheless , these uncertainties get smaller as we decrease the number of independent bins and thus increase the amount data within a redshift bin .",
    "the abundant literature sources on model independent reconstructions of dark energy makes one believe this has become a worthy line of investigation .",
    "the approach we have been concerned with in this paper has been amply covered in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to take the dimensionless coordinate distance and try to reconstruct it with minimal assumptions , and then push the reconstruction two levels deeper and consider as well the first and second derivatives with respect to redshift . the way to do",
    "this is to carry out polynomial fits in different redshift windows ( with carefully chosen characteristics ) .",
    "we have described the method following the original prescriptions , including throughout additional remarks to facilitate comprehension of the various steps involved .",
    "our main work tool has also been sneia luminosity measurements , but we have been benefited by the availability of a sample which offers more than twice the number of sources : the very recent union2 sample .",
    "this clearly allows for some improvement , as increased density of the datasets induces in general tighter constraints .",
    "nevertheless , it must be stressed that the sample considered in our paper is rather heterogeneous .",
    "a fact that seems to have been overlooked in previous references is that the quite noticeable oscillations arising at some levels of the reconstruction are mainly a consequence of data with large error bars in the samples .",
    "the fitting algorithm does not seem to be the culprit for these effects .",
    "we have been able to reach these conclusions by considering conveniently cut versions of the union2 sample .",
    "the cut produces a spectacular reduction of the noisy features .",
    "this suggests it could be worth revisiting this technique when significant advances occur in the compiled datasets . for completeness and comparison",
    "we have also performed a similar analysis with grbs , but the reconstruction turn out to be rather poor ( as otherwise expected ) .    on general grounds we can say the reconstruction from sneia is very satisfactory for the dimensionless coordinate ,",
    "but it degrades considerably as subsequent derivatives of it are considered .",
    "estimates of global features agree very well with state of the art guesses from other sources , and no strong dependence on the size of the window is appreciated at lowest levels .",
    "we find a hubble constant of a bit more than @xmath99 ( km / s)/mpc , a deceleration factor in the vicinity of @xmath100 , and a current value of the dark energy parameter in the vicinity of @xmath101 .    for further insight into the problem we have also performed reconstructions using a mock sneia sample depicting a future optimistic observational situation .",
    "the results support broadly what real data tell us , and in particular we find that dispersion in the data influences the reconstruction process a great deal .    and finally , using the binning method , we have obtained independent values of several quantities of interest .",
    "these may be useful for a quick / preliminary estimate of cosmological constraints without having to resort to a full dataset .",

    "<S> in contrast to original works , we conclude they can not be used for cosmological purposes , and the state of the art does not allow to regard them on the same quality basis as sneia . the next direction we contribute to is the question of how the adjusting of some parameters ( window width , overlap , selection criteria ) affect the results . </S>",

    "<S> then , we try to establish what is the current redshift range for which one can make solid predictions on dark energy evolution . </S>",
