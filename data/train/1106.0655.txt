    "in this paper , we obtain a one - dimensional model for the resonances of a tube with a small hole pierced on its side .",

    "we show that this kind of techniques applies to the mathematical modelling of music instruments .    * basic facts on wind instruments . *",
    "+ the acoustic of flutes is a large subject of research for acousticians . basically , a flute is the combination of an exciter which creates a periodic motion ( a fipple , a reed etc . ) and a tube , whose first mode of resonance selects the note produced . studying the acoustic of a flute combines a lot of problems as the influence of the shape of the tube , the study of the creation of oscillations by blowing in the fipple ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for nice introductions . in this paper",
    ", we will not consider the creation of the periodic excitation , we rather want to study mathematically the resonances of the tube of the flute and how an open hole affects it .",
    "therefore , we simplify the problem by making the following usual assumptions : + - the pressure of the air in the tube follows the wave equation and therefore the resonances of the tube are the squareroots of the eigenvalues of the corresponding laplacian operator .",
    "+ - on the inner surface of the tube , the pressure satisfies homogeneous neumann boundary condition .",
    "+ - where the tube is open to the exterior , we assume that the pressure is equal to the exterior pressure which may be assumed to be zero without loss of generality . + we can roughly classify the tube of the wind instruments in three different categories , depending on which end of the tube is open .",

    "notice that this rough approximation can explain simple facts : a tube with a closed end sounds an octave lower than an open tube of the same length ( enabling for example to make shorter organ pipes for low notes ) and moreover it produces only the odd harmonics ( explaining the particular sounds of reed instruments ) .",
    "in this article , we study how the one - dimensional limit is affected by opening one of the holes of the flute , say a hole at position @xmath11 . at first sight",
    ", one may think that it is equivalent to cutting the tube at the place of the open hole .",
    "in other words , the note is the same as the one produced by a tube of length @xmath12 .",
    "this is roughly true for flutes with large holes as the modern transverse flute , except that one must add a small correction and the length @xmath13 of the equivalent tube is slightly larger than @xmath12 .",
    "this length @xmath13 is called the effective length .",
    "this kind of approximation seems to be the most used one by acousticians .",
    "it states that the resonances of the tube with an open hole are : a fundamental frequency ] @xmath14 and harmonics @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "however , the approximation of the resonances by the ones of a tube of length @xmath13 is too rough for flutes with small holes as the baroque flute or the recorder . in particular , the approximation by effective length fails to explain the following observations , for which we refer e.g. to @xcite and @xcite : + - the effective length depends on the frequency of the waves in the tube .",
    "in other words , the harmonics are not exact multiples of the fundamental frequency .",
    "+ - closing or opening one of the holes placed after the first open hole of the tube changes the note of the flute .",
    "this enables to obtain some notes by fork fingering , as it is common in baroque flute or recorder .",
    "we also enhance that some effects of the baroque flute or of the recorder are produced by half - holing ,",
    "that is that by half opening a hole ( some flutes have even holes consisting in two small close holes to make half - holing easier ) . in these cases ,",
    "the effective length @xmath13 is not only related to the position @xmath12 of the first open hole , which makes the method of approximation by effective length less relevant .",
    "+ the purpose of this article is to obtain an explicit one - dimensional mathematical model for the flute with a open hole , which could be more relevant in the case of small holes than the approximation by effective length .",
    "the models used by the acousticians are based on the notion of impedance .",
    "the model introduced here rather uses the framework of differential operators .    * the thin domains techniques .",
    "* + the fact that the behaviour of thin three dimensional objects as a rope or a plate can be approximated by one- or two - dimensional equations has been known since a long time , see @xcite and @xcite for example . in general , a thin domain problem consists in a partial differential equation @xmath17 defined in a domain @xmath18 of dimension @xmath19 , which has @xmath20 dimensions of negligible size with respect to the other @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "the aim is then to obtain an approximation of the problem by an equation @xmath22 defined in a domain @xmath23 of dimension @xmath21 .",
    "it seems that the first modern rigorous studies of such approximations mostly date back to the late 80 s : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ... there exists an enormous quantity of papers dealing with thin domain problems of many different types .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a presentation of the subject and some references .    in this paper ,",
    "the domain @xmath18 is the thin tube of the flute and we hope to model the behaviour of the internal air pressure by a one - dimensional equation .",
    "it is well known that the wave equation in a simple tube can be approximated by the one - dimensional wave equation .",
    "even the case of a far more complicated domain squeezed along some dimension is well understood , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we will assume in this paper that the open parts of the tube yield a dirichlet boundary condition for the pressure in the tube .",
    "in fact , we could study the whole system of a thin tube connected to a large room and show that , at a first order of approximation , the effect of the connection with a large domain is the same as a the one of a dirichlet boundary condition , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the other works related to the `` dumbbell shape '' model .",
    "the main difficulty of our problem comes from the different scales : the open hole on the side of the tube is of size @xmath24 , whereas the diameter of the tube is of size @xmath25 .",
    "thin domains involving different order of thickness have been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the related works .",

    "first , let us compute the frequencies of the flute with an open hole , following the model yielded by theorem [ th ] .",
    "theorem [ th ] deals with the spectrum of @xmath32 , whereas the resonances of the pressure in a flute follow the wave equation @xmath47 ( remind that @xmath32 denotes the positive laplacian operator ) .",
    "therefore , the relevant eigenvalues are in fact the ones of the operator @xmath48 which are @xmath49 .",
    "theorem [ th ] shows that the frequencies @xmath50 are asymptotically equal to the frequencies @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is an eigenvalue of @xmath35 .",

    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath35 corresponds to the expected profile of the pressure in the flute with an open hole , see figure [ fct ] and the ones of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* the note of the flute corresponds to the fundamental frequency @xmath57 . to obtain a given note",
    ", one can adjust both @xmath58 ( the size of the hole ) and @xmath12 ( the place of the hole ) .",
    "this enables to place smartly the different holes to obtain some notes by combining the opening of several holes ( fork fingering ) .",
    "we can also compute the change of frequency produced by only half opening the hole ( half - holing ) . notice that changing the shape of the hole affects the coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "* the overtones of the flute correspond to the other frequencies @xmath59 with @xmath16 .",
    "we can see in figure [ fct ] that they are not exactly harmonic , i.e. they are not multiples of the fundamental frequency .",
    "this explains why the sound of flutes , which have only a small hole opened , is uneven and not as pure as the sound produced by a simple tube .",
    "in other words , our model directly explains the observation that the effective length approximation depends on the considered frequency .",
    "moreover , when @xmath60 increases , the slope of @xmath61 becomes steeper due to the factor @xmath60 in and the solutions of are closer to @xmath62 .",
    "this is consistant with the observation that high frequencies are less affected by the presence of the hole than low frequencies , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , notice that this is only roughly true since for example one can see on figure [ fct ] that the second overtone is almost equal to @xmath63 , whereas the fourth one is less close to @xmath64 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath65 is almost a node of the mode @xmath66 .",
    "* of course , when @xmath67 , we recover the equation @xmath68 corresponding to the eigenvalue of the open tube without hole . when @xmath69 , i.e. when the hole is very large , we recover the equations @xmath70 or @xmath71 , which correspond to two separated tubes of lengths @xmath12 and @xmath72 ( in fact the part @xmath73 is not important because this is not the part of the tube which is excited by the fipple )",
    ". when the hole is of intermediate size , the fundamental frequency corresponds to a tube of intermediate length @xmath74 , but the overtones are not the same as the ones of the tube of length @xmath13 . * the thin domain techniques used here are general and do not depend on the fact that the section of the tube @xmath18 is a square and not a disk .",
    "if the surface @xmath75 of the section of the tube is not constant ( think at the end of a clarinet ) , then the operator @xmath76 in the definition of @xmath35 must be replaced by @xmath77 , see @xcite .",
    "of course , if there are several open holes , then other terms of the type @xmath78 appear in .    to conclude , we obtain in this article a mathematical model for the flute with a small open hole , which consists in a one - dimensional operator different from a simple laplacian operator .",
    "it yields simple explanation of some observations as the fact that the overtones are not harmonic .",
    "when @xmath25 goes to zero , if one rescales the domain @xmath18 with a ratio @xmath79 to focus on the hole , then one sees the rescaling domain @xmath18 converging to the half - space @xmath80 ( see figure  [ k ] ) .",
