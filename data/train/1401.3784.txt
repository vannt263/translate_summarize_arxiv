    "proper - motion and/or parallax measurements will test this hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , future studies may reveal additional stars in m62 with a range of neutron - capture element abundances .",
    "if m62 really hosts two populations of stars , of equal size , with distinct neutron - capture element abundances , then the probability of observing six out of seven program stars from a single population is 6% .",
    "in this paper we present a chemical abundance analysis of seven bright giants in m62 , a luminous globular cluster with an extended horizontal branch .",
    "we find no evidence for a metallicity dispersion , as seen in other luminous globular clusters with similar horizontal branch morphology .",
    "we find star - to - star abundance variations and correlations for o , na and al and the amplitudes of those variations are comparable to those found in the most massive globular clusters .",
    "the elements zr , ba and la exhibit enhancements , [ x / fe ] @xmath12 + 0.4 , compared to field stars at the same metallicity .",
    "the lack of a significant correlation between the abundances of na and the neutron - capture elements would suggest that the light element variations and enhancement in y , zr and ba are produced in different processes and/or sites .    for the elements heavier than la , the abundances are consistent with the scaled - solar @xmath4-process distribution .",
    "on the other hand , y , zr and ba are clearly enhanced when compared to the scaled - solar @xmath4-process distribution .",
    "the abundance pattern for these elements is incompatible with the s - process in agb stars or in non - rotating massive stars . on the other hand , while the abundance distribution for these elements could be produced by fast - rotating massive stars , the high [ rb / y ] ratios that we measure do not match existing frms model predictions .",
    "one star has neutron - capture element abundance ratios that are distinct from the remaining stars .",
    "while this is likely a field halo star , the identification of additional stars in the vicinity of m62 with similar abundance patterns would be of great interest .",
    "studies of other luminous globular clusters are necessary to complete the census and characterisation of the most luminous clusters in the milky way .",
