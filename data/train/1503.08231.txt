    "in a recent paper , a novel type of spin calogero models and their associated spin chains of haldane  shastry type was introduced  @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these models is that they are constructed using a new representation of the weyl group of the @xmath3 root system , obtained by replacing the standard spin reversal operators by an arbitrarily polarized version thereof .",
    "as shown in the latter reference , these models are exactly solvable for all such representations and , in particular , the partition function of the spin chains can be exactly computed using polychronakos s freezing trick  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the above results to spin calogero models and their corresponding spin chains of haldane  shastry type based on the @xmath0 root system .    in order to present our work in an appropriate context ,",
    "let us briefly recall the origin and significance of the latter models .",
    "the haldane  shastry ( hs ) spin chain , introduced independently by these authors in the late eighties  @xcite , is perhaps the best known example of an exactly solvable one - dimensional lattice model with long - range interactions .",
    "more precisely , this model describes a circular array of equispaced spins with two - body interactions inversely proportional to the square of the ( chord ) distance between the spins .",
    "the motivation for introducing this chain was the construction of a simple model with an exact ground state given by the @xmath4 limit of gutzwiller s variational wavefunction for the ground state of the one - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite . over the years",
    ", the hs chain has appeared in many areas of interest both in physics and mathematics , such as fractional statistics and one - dimensional anyons  @xcite , quantum entanglement  @xcite , characterization of integrability vs.  quantum chaos  @xcite , quantum integrability via the asymptotic bethe ansatz  @xcite , yangian quantum groups  @xcite , and conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties of the hs chain already noted by haldane and shastry in their original papers is its intimate connection with the scalar ( trigonometric ) sutherland model  @xcite .",
    "this connection was subsequently elucidated by polychronakos in ref .",
    "@xcite , who showed how to derive the hs chain from the spin sutherland model  @xcite by a technique that he called the `` freezing trick '' . the main idea behind this technique",
    "is to note that when the coupling constant in the spin sutherland model goes to infinity the particles tend to concentrate on the coordinates of the ( essentially unique ) minimum of the scalar part of the interaction potential , which are precisely the sites of the hs chain .",
    "thus , in this limit the dynamical and the spin degrees of freedom decouple , and the latter are governed by the chain s hamiltonian .",
    "using this idea it is straightforward , for instance , to obtain the first integrals of the hs chain from their well - known counterparts for the spin sutherland model .",
    "in fact , polychronakos showed that applying the same procedure to the ( rational ) calogero model  @xcite and its spin version  @xcite one obtains an integrable chain with non - equispaced sites and long - range interactions inversely proportional to the distance between the spins  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this chain known in the literature as the polychronakos ",
    "frahm ( pf ) chain was first studied numerically by frahm  @xcite and then exactly computed by polychronakos  @xcite , who derived an exact formula for the partition function by means of the freezing trick . on the other hand , the partition function of the hs chain was only evaluated more than a decade later by some of the authors  @xcite .    both the sutherland and calogero models ( and their corresponding hs and pf spin chains ) are associated with the @xmath5 root system , where @xmath2 is the number of particles .",
    "indeed , in these models the interactions only depend on the difference between the coordinates , and the spin operators appearing in the hamiltonian are permutation operators , and thus generate a realization of the weyl group of @xmath5 type .",
    "in fact , there are versions of the sutherland and calogero models associated to any ( extended ) classical root system  @xcite . among these systems , those of @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 type are by far the most studied in the literature , since they make it possible to construct integrable models with an arbitrary number of particles . by applying the freezing trick to the spin version of these models one obtains the corresponding generalizations of the hs and pf chains , that we shall collectively refer to as spin chains of hs type  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental features of the @xmath3 root system and its @xmath6 and @xmath7 degenerations is the fact that its weyl algebra contains a family of reflection operators @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "( in the case of the @xmath0 root system , the weyl group only contains products @xmath11 with @xmath12 . ) in the spin chains studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , the operators @xmath8 are represented by spin reversal operators @xmath13 ( acting on the hilbert space of the @xmath14-th particle ) , but this is by no means the only possible choice . as a matter of fact , in the novel version of the spin calogero model of @xmath3 type and its corresponding ( pf ) chain introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the operators @xmath8 are represented instead by arbitrarily polarized spin reversal operators ( psro ) @xmath15 , which act as the identity on the first @xmath16 elements of the spin basis and as minus the identity on the rest . these operators are equivalent under a similarity transformation to the usual spin reversal operators @xmath13 only when @xmath17 or @xmath18 , i.e. , when there is minimal polarization . for the remaining values of the discrete parameters",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath19 , the systems constructed in the latter reference differ from the standard calogero and pf models of @xmath3-type . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath16 or @xmath19 are zero , the corresponding spin dynamical model reduces to the @xmath20-invariant extension of the calogero model studied by simons and altshuler  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the spin calogero model of @xmath0-type with psro and its corresponding spin chain of hs type , i.e. , the pf chain of @xmath0 type with psro . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , these models are singular limits of their corresponding @xmath3 counterparts , so that their spectrum can not be obtained by setting to zero the parameter @xmath21 in the latter models ( cf .  eqs .   and  ) .",
    "this is also apparent at the level of the hilbert space , which is the direct sum of the hilbert spaces of two @xmath3 models with opposite chiralities .",
    "thus , the models studied in this paper are not limiting cases of their @xmath3 versions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main result is the derivation of a closed - form expression for the partition function of the pf chain of @xmath0 type with psro in terms of products of partition functions of type-@xmath1 pf chains .",
    "our approach is based on the computation of the spectrum and partition function of the corresponding spin calogero model , from which the chain s partition function follows by a standard freezing trick argument .",
    "the structure of this partition function turns out to be more involved than that of its @xmath3 counterpart .",
    "in particular , it is not manifest that it is a polynomial in @xmath22 , as follows from the freezing trick . using the explicit expression for the partition function",
    ", we shall study several global properties of the chain s spectrum , such as the behavior of the level density and the average degeneracy when the number of spins tends to infinity .",
    "in particular , the fact that the number of distinct levels grows polynomially with the number of spins suggests that this model is isospectral to a yangian - invariant vertex model of the kind studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.consm ]",
    "we recall the definition and main properties of the polarized spin reversal operators @xmath15 , and construct the hamiltonians of the @xmath0-type spin calogero model with psro and its associated spin chain .",
    "section  [ sec.specpf ] is devoted to the derivation of the closed - form expression of the chain s partition function , as explained in the previous paragraph . using this expression , in section  [ sec.stat ] we analyze several global properties of the spectrum , providing strong numerical evidence of the gaussian character of the level density when the number of spins is large enough . in section  [ sec.ferro ]",
    "we extend the above results to the ferromagnetic version of the models under consideration .",
    "the paper ends with a brief section summarizing our main results and presenting our conclusions , and a short technical appendix establishing a useful recursion relation for the partition function of the pf chain of type @xmath5 .",
    "for the purpose of describing the @xmath0-type calogero model with polarized spin reversal operators , it is convenient to briefly summarize the construction of its @xmath3 counterpart @xcite . to this end , let @xmath23 denote the internal spin space for @xmath2 particles . as usual ,",

    "<S> we study the spin calogero model of @xmath0 type with polarized spin reversal operators , as well as its associated spin chain of haldane  shastry type , both in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the spectrum and the partition function of the former model in closed form , from which we derive an exact formula for the chain s partition function in terms of products of partition functions of polychronakos  </S>",
    "<S> frahm spin chains of type  @xmath1 . using a recursion relation for the latter partition functions that we derive in the paper , we are able to numerically evaluate the partition function , and thus the spectrum , of the @xmath0-type spin chain for relatively high values of the number of spins  @xmath2 . we analyze several global properties of the chain s spectrum , such as the asymptotic level density , the distribution of consecutive spacings of the unfolded spectrum , and the average degeneracy . in particular , our results suggest that this chain is invariant under a suitable yangian group , and that its spectrum coincides with that of a yangian - invariant vertex model with linear energy function and dispersion relation .    </S>",
