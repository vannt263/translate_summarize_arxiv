    "high - power accelerators simply can not operate without adequate systems to control unavoidable losses in standard beam operation . the operation and physics goals of recent superconducting , high - energy hadron colliders , such as the tevatron @xcite , the relativistic heavy - ion collider @xcite , and the lhc ,",

    ", the inner aperture of lhc magnets sits only a few centimetres apart from the circulating beams , which carry a total energy more than a billion times larger than that necessary to perturb the operation of superconductors .",

    "the general scope of a collimation system is to dispose , safely and in a controlled way , of beam losses that would otherwise occur at sensitive locations or on accelerator equipment that is not designed to withstand beam losses . in practice",
    ", this general definition finds its concrete implementations depending on the specific design goals required for a given accelerator .",
    "for example , collimation requirements are different for ` warm ' high - power machines , where loss localization is crucial , than for ` superconducting ' accelerators , where operation efficiency is ensured by keeping losses in cold magnets below quench limits .",
    "the roles of collimation systems in accelerators are discussed in section  [ roles ] . in section",
    "[ notation ] , some basic notation is introduced and the inputs to collimation design from machine aperture and beam loss mechanisms are discussed .",
    "the design of a multistage collimation system is outlined in section  [ stages ] .",
    "the second part of this document is focused on the presentation of the lhc collimation system as a case study . in section  [ lhc - coll ] , the system layout is reviewed and operational challenges for beam collimation are introduced , presenting the solutions deployed at the lhc . the lhc collimator design is discussed in section  [ design ] and the collimation performance achieved in lhc run  i @xcite , at energies of up to @xmath1 and stored beam energies of 150 , is reviewed in section  [ lhc - perf ] .",
    "the lecture is concluded with a brief review of advanced collimation concepts that are being considered for upgrading the present lhc collimation and for implementation in future accelerators under study .",
    "this is presented in section  [ advanced ] .",
    "typical roles of collimation systems are summarized in the following .    * * cleaning of betatron and off - momentum beam halos * : unavoidable beam losses of halo particles must be intercepted and safely disposed of before they reach sensitive equipment .",
    "the required cleaning performance depends on the design of the accelerator .",
    "the most challenging requirements arise for superconducting accelerators , where loads from beam losses must remain below the quench limits of superconducting magnets .",
    "for example , the lhc design beam stored energy of @xmath2 has to be compared with typical quench limits of a few tens of mw/@xmath3 @xcite . * * passive machine protection * : collimators are the closest elements to the circulating beam and represent the first line of defence in various normal and abnormal loss cases , as discussed in several companion lectures at this school .",
    "owing to the damage potential of hadron beams , this functionality has become one of the most critical aspects of the operation of accelerators @xcite , as well as a crucial input to the design of collimators that must withstand design failures . * * cleaning of collision products * : in colliders , this is achieved with dedicated movable collimators located in the outgoing beam paths of each high - luminosity experiment , to catch the products of collisions : direct collision debris and beam particles that emerge from the collision points with modified angles and energy . *",
    "* optimization of the experiment background * ( minimization of halo - induced noise in detector measurements ) : this is one of the classical roles of collimation systems in previous colliders .",
    "beam tail scraping or local shielding at the detector locations can reduce spurious signals in detectors ( see , for example , a recent report @xcite ) . * * concentration of radiation doses * : for high - power machines , it is becoming increasingly important to be able to localize beam losses in confined and optimized ` hot ' areas rather than having a distribution of many activated areas along the machine .",
    "this is an essential design requirement for collimation systems , to allow easy access for maintenance in the largest fraction of the machine . *",
    "* local protection of equipment for improved lifetime against radiation effects * : dedicated movable or fixed collimators are used to shield equipment locally .",
    "for example , passive absorbers are used in the lhc collimation inserts to reduce total doses , and to warm dipoles and quadrupoles that would otherwise have a short lifetime in the high - radiation environment foreseen during the nominal lhc operation .",
    "the exposure of radiation to equipment might not pose immediate limitations to operation of a machine but its optimization is crucial to ensure long - term reliability .",
    "* * beam halo scraping and halo diagnostics * : though rarely a driving design criterion , the possibility to scan the beam distribution actively can be a very useful functionality of a collimation system .",
    "collimator scanning in association with sensitive beam loss monitoring systems proved a powerful method of probing the population of beam tails @xcite , which are otherwise too small , compared with the beam core , to be measured by conventional emittance measurements .",
    "thanks to their robustness , the lhc primary collimators can be efficiently used to scrape and shape the beams , as in ref .",
    "full beam scraping also provides precise , though destructive , measurements of beam sizes .",
    "a collimation system might typically fulfil several roles .",
    "for example , the concentration of radiation losses or the reduction of experimental background are natural by - products of a very efficient beam collimation design .",
    "conversely , before designing a collimation system , it is important to identify the driving requirements for its design in a specific accelerator . for the lhc ,",
    "the driving design criterion is halo cleaning , which must be excellent to operate the machine below the quench limit of the superconducting magnets at maximum beam energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the present lhc beam collimation @xcite is quite special in that it fulfils all the roles listed , thanks to a careful design that has been extended beyond the cleaning functionality .",
    "the price to pay for this performance is the unprecedented complexity , which poses important operational challenges , as discussed in section [ lhc - perf ] .",
    "particles with transverse amplitudes or energy deviations significantly larger than those of the reference particle are referred to as _ beam halo particles_. one can distinguish between _ betatron _ and _ off - momentum _ halos , which are formed in the case of larger - than - nominal transverse emittance or energy error , respectively .",
    "the transverse amplitude of a particle @xmath4 around a closed orbit , @xmath5 , can be expressed as a function of the longitudinal curvilinear coordinate @xmath6 for the twiss parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 as @xmath10 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta p}{p}\\right)_id_z(s)~ , \\label{eqmot}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the single - particle emittance , @xmath12 is the energy error , and @xmath13 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "size of the beam at location @xmath6 is then given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the r.m.s .",
    "transverse emittance and energy spread of the beam .",
    "the notation to express the machine aperture and the collimator settings will use , unless specified otherwise , the _ betatron beam size _ , @xmath17 which takes into account only the contribution to the beam size from the betatron motion .",
    "collimator settings might then be given in normalized units as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance in millimetres between the collimator jaw and the circulating beam ( the half gap of a two - sided collimator centred around the beam , as shown in ) .",
    "the distinction between halo and core particles is , to a certain extent , arbitrary . for gaussian distributions ,",
    "one may define as halo particles those with amplitudes above three r.m.s .",
    "deviations of the gaussian ( see dashed lines in ) , with emittances larger than @xmath20 . for a beam with perfect two - dimensional gaussian distributions in the @xmath21 plane ,",
    "about 1.1% of the total beam particles have amplitudes above @xmath22 and 0.03% above @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "particles this far out from the beam core are rarely of any use for accelerators and are more likely to cause nuisances ( beam losses , irradiation of components , background in detectors , ) . for off - momentum halos , a similar definition could be adopted .",
    "for other purposes in circular accelerators , one might consider as halo the particles outside the rf bucket that are lost when beams are accelerated or in the presence of synchrotron radiation ( which is non - negligible at the lhc ) .",
    "beam collimation is achieved by placing blocks of material , the _ collimator jaws _",
    ", close to the circulating beams , to constrain the betatron amplitudes of stray particles outside the core .",
    "this is shown schematically by the black boxes in .",
    "collimation of off - momentum tails might be achieved in a similar way as for betatron tails , by placing collimators at locations of high dispersion , where the particle s energy shift results in a transverse offset , as in the second term on the right - hand side of .",
    "how close to the beam a collimator should be depends on various aspects that will be elaborated on in the rest of this paper .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the outer limit for a collimator setting depends on the available machine aperture that needs to be protected and on the cleaning performance that needs to be achieved .",
    "the inner limit depends essentially on how collimators perturb beam stability through an increase in the machine impedance .",
    "tighter settings also typically lead to higher beam losses and tighter positioning tolerances against orbit movements and optics errors .",
    "thus , collimators should not be set closer to the beams than is strictly necessary .",
    "the cleaning performance of a collimation system is measured by the _ collimation efficiency _",
    ", a figure of merit that expresses the fraction of halo particles ` caught ' by the system over the total lost from the beam .",
    "a perfect beam collimation provides 100% cleaning , there is no beam loss at sensitive equipment .",
    "alternatively , the _ cleaning inefficiency _ , @xmath24 , can be introduced as the relative fraction of beam that ` leaks ' to other accelerator components , @xmath25 , compared with what is intercepted and safely disposed of by the collimators , @xmath26 : @xmath27 the relevant measure of ` beam loss ' , indicated as @xmath28 in this equation , has to be identified for the specific design criteria that the collimation system addresses .",
    "the lhc beam collimation requirements are driven by the challenge to keep beam losses below the quench limits of the superconducting magnets . in this case , the inefficiency @xmath24 is defined as the number of protons lost as a fraction of the total number of particles absorbed by the collimation system .",
    "the _ local cleaning inefficiency _ , @xmath29 , is defined as a function of the longitudinal coordinate @xmath6 as the fractional loss per unit length , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of particles lost over the distance @xmath32 , in the longitudinal range @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the number of particles absorbed by the collimation system .",
    "this definition has the advantage that it can be directly compared with the quench limits of superconducting magnets if a proper _ dilution length _ is chosen .",
    "indeed , for the lhc it was estimated @xcite that the quench limits in units of proton lost per unit length , @xmath35 , are @xmath36 for beams at injection ( @xmath37 ) and top ( @xmath38 ) energies , respectively .",
    "these approximate figures were used early in the lhc design phase and in first collimation performance estimates @xcite . although nowadays detailed simulation tools and more adequate models are available to compare peaks of energy deposition in the magnet coils directly against quench limits of superconducting cables ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the formalism introduced here is very useful to introduce challenges for collimation design , as discussed next .",
    "there are various mechanisms that lead to losses in particle accelerators , as also discussed in companion lectures at this school @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish between _ regular _ and _ abnormal beam losses _ , referring to unavoidable losses that occur during standard operation , as opposed to losses caused by failures of accelerator systems or by wrong beam manipulations .",
    "for both categories , losses might occur over a broad range of time - scales , from a fraction of a single turn to tens of seconds .    in circular colliders ,",
    "a main source of loss comes from the collisions of the opposing beams that cause burn - off of beam particles .",
    "other sources of loss are interactions with residual gas , intrabeam scattering , beam instabilities of various types ( single - bunch , collective , beam  beam , ) , the noise of feedback systems used to stabilize beams , transverse and longitudinal resonances , include rf noise .",
    "other losses inherent to operation phases of the accelerator , such as capture losses at the beginning of the ramp , injection and dump losses , losses during dynamics changes of the operational cycle ( orbit drifts , optics changes , energy ramp , ) , are referred to as ` operational losses ' @xcite .",
    "ignoring , for the moment , very fast loss scenarios and their impact on collimator design @xcite , let us consider the requirements for beam collimation in the presence of _ diffusive losses_. in this case , the transverse increase of particle action per turn is much smaller than one sigma of the r.m.s .",
    "distribution . rather than treating each loss mechanism in detail",
    ", losses are modelled by considering the beam lifetime",
    ".    the time - dependent circulating beam intensity , @xmath39 , can , for most practical purposes , be modelled by an exponential decay function whose time constant , @xmath40 , defines the _ beam lifetime _ as @xmath41 for an initial beam current @xmath42 .",
    "after a time @xmath43 , the total beam current is reduced to about 37% .",
    "example profiles of relative beam intensity versus time , @xmath44 , are shown in for lifetime values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in a linear approximation , beam loss rates , @xmath47 ,",

    "an example of measured @xmath43 during lhc fills for physics is shown in . in 2012 , proton beams were accelerated to @xmath1 , whereas in 2011 the maximum energy was 3.5 . the machine configuration and tcp settings were different in these runs .",

    "courtesy of b.  salvachua.,width=453 ]    a collimation system must be designed to cope with the maximum expected rates of beam loss .",
    "this is determined by the _ minimum allowed beam lifetime _ , @xmath53 , throughout the operational cycle , most notably during phases at maximum energy ( flat - top , squeeze , collision preparation , and physics data recording ) when the beam stored energy is largest .",

    "the minimum lifetime measured during the squeeze process in 2012 is shown in  .",
    "values of @xmath43 below @xmath45 were recorded on a regular basis , with several cases even below @xmath56 .",
    "the same behaviour at higher beam intensity and energy , as expected in 2015 , will cause frequent beam dumps , with a severe impact on lhc operation .",
    "the lhc case of beam collimation in the presence of high - energy and high - intensity proton beams is considered here . for the collimation system to fulfil the required cleaning goals",
    ", it must be ensured that :    * the aperture bottlenecks of the accelerators are geometrically shielded such that , for all loss scenarios , primary beam losses hit first collimators ; * the total energy carried by the beam , out - scattered beam particles and the secondary products of beam particles interactions with the collimator matter , is absorbed within the collimation region , with tolerable leakage to sensitive equipment , notably to cold magnets , for any relevant loss scenarios ; * the collimators themselves and other equipment installed in the collimation regions must withstand , without damage , beam losses for different design scenarios ; * the contribution to machine impedance from the collimator materials approached to the beam must be tolerable and ensure that the high - intensity beams remain stable .",

    ", is also connected to this support , to record losses generated locally when the beam is intercepted by the collimator jaws .",
    "the collimator design has been recently improved by adding two beam position monitors on either extremity of each jaw @xcite .",
    "an example of a cfc jaw prototype with this new design is shown in .",
    "this feature allows faster collimator alignment as well as constant monitoring of the beam orbit at the collimator , as opposed to the beam - loss - monitor - based alignment that can currently only be performed during dedicated low - intensity commissioning fills .",

    "the cleaning performance of the lhc collimation system is measured by intentionally generating transverse and off - momentum beam losses while measuring losses around the ring .",
    "this is done with low intensities circulating in the machine .",
    "a few bunches are excited by driving the betatron tune close to resonance or by adding transverse noise with the transverse damper .",
    "the latter method is preferred , as it can act in a bunch - by - bunch mode so one fill can be used for several loss maps .",
    "large losses of the momentum cleaning can instead be generated by changing the radio frequency .",
    "these so - called _ loss maps _ are used to validate , empirically , the response of the collimation system in the presence of high loss rates .",
    "this is an essential part of the validation of the lhc machine protection functionality , as discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , loss maps are used to verify : ( 1 ) that the hierarchy is respected , by checking that the relative loss rates at the different collimators are in agreement with predictions or within tolerable levels ; ( 2 ) that the leakage of losses to the other machine equipment , in particular superconducting magnets , are as expected ; ( 3 ) that the system performance remain stable during long periods when beam - based alignment is not repeated .",
    "examples of betatron and off - momentum loss maps are shown in .",
    "these maps were recorded in 2012 at @xmath1 , with beams squeezed to @xmath96 in ir1 and ir5 . at the lhc ,",
    "beam losses are recorded by about 3600 beam loss monitors around the ring @xcite . to estimate the cleaning inefficiency , losses at each monitor are normalized to the highest measured signal , next to the primary collimators .",
    "this is shown in as a function of the longitudinal coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "it is seen that inefficiencies less than @xmath97 were achieved . in all irs ,",

    "note that , with the exception of a few isolated peaks in the dispersion suppressor , the rest of the cold machine experiences losses that are more than one order of magnitude smaller , close to the noise of the beam loss monitor system . in simulations , losses are sampled using @xmath98 bins , counting the number of beam particles hitting the aperture . in measurements ,",
    "losses are measured at the discrete locations of beam loss monitors that record the flux of ionizing particles in the beam loss monitor volume .",
    "clearly , these two quantities can not be directly compared without additional simulations of energy deposition , starting from the multiturn loss pattern .",

    "other advanced collimation concepts have been under study in the last year , as possible methods of improving the performance of the lhc multistage system . in this section ,",
    "the main topics presently under investigation are introduced .",
    "possible immediate applications of such advanced concepts are already under consideration for the high - luminosity upgrade of the lhc .      protons and ions interacting with the collimators in ir7 emerge from the ir with a changed magnetic rigidity .",
    "this represents a source of local heat deposition in the cold dispersion suppressor magnets downstream of ir7 , where the dispersion starts to increase : these losses are the limiting locations for collimation cleaning , they are the highest cold losses around the ring .",
    "this may pose a certain risk for inducing magnet quenches , in particular , in view of the higher intensities expected for hl - lhc .",
    "this problem arises for halo collimation of both proton and heavy - ion beams .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to add local collimators in the dispersion suppressors , which is only feasible with a major change of the cold layout at the locations where the dispersion starts to increase .",
    "indeed , the existing system s multistage cleaning is not efficient at catching these dispersive losses . clearly , the need for local collimation depends on the absolute level of losses achieved in operation and the quench limit of superconducting magnets . in view of the uncertainties in the scaling of the current system performance for operation at @xmath76 , it is important to take appropriate margins , to minimize the risk of limitation in the future .",
    "a solution with minimum impact on the cold section layout is to replace the existing @xmath99 long dipoles with two shorter , higher - field magnets , by freeing enough space to install a warm collimator .",
    "this solution is illustrated in .",
    "it requires an @xmath100 dipole field to free sufficient space for a warm collimator to be installed in a dedicated cryogenics by - pass system , as shown in . even in this tight space limitation , an adequate solution can be found .",
    "new dipoles and collimators are being prototyped at cern , providing a viable solution for ir7 cleaning upgrades that might already be available for a long lhc stop planned for 2019 .",
    "note that this solution is modular and was designed to be implemented easily in any existing dipole location .",
    "it can therefore also be used to improve cleaning around collision points , if necessary , as is foreseen for the alice ion experiment @xcite .",

    "courtesy of d.  ramos and l  gentini.,width=377 ]      the lhc impedance budget is largely dominated by the contribution of the lhc collimators .",
    "for this reason , the current collimation system was conceived in such a way that it can be easily upgraded to reduce the impedance @xcite : every secondary collimator slot in ir3 and ir7 features a companion slot for the future installation of a low - impedance secondary collimator .",
    "a total of 22 slots in ir7 and 8 slots in ir3 are already cabled for a quick installation of new collimators  referred to as tcspms  which can either replace or supplement the existing tcsg collimators .",
    "the tcspms will include pick - ups for orbit measurements ( ` p ' ) and will be based on metal composites ( ` m ' ) .",
    "in addition , limited robustness against beam losses of the present tungsten collimator has already limited the lhc performance of run  i in terms of @xmath95 reach , because adequate margins had to be taken in the collimation hierarchy to shield the existing tertiary collimators properly @xcite .",
    "a rich programme of research and development was initiated , to find novel material with optimum response to thermomechanical stress and with reduced impedance , to improve various limitations of current lhc collimator materials .",
    "more details are given in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "simulations predict that beam stability can be re - established for all hl - lhc scenarios if the cfc of the existing secondary collimators is replaced , at least in the betatron cleaning insertion ( ir7 ) , with a jaw material having an electrical conductivity a factor of 50 to 100 higher than cfc @xcite .",
    "this improvement could easily be achieved if the jaw material were made of highly conductive metals , such as copper or molybdenum . however",
    ", secondary collimators in ir7 also play a crucial role in lhc machine protection and might be exposed to large beam losses .",
    "therefore , collimator materials and designs must also be robust against beam failure .",
    "the driving requirements for the development of new materials are thus : ( i ) low resistive - wall impedance , to avoid beam instabilities ; ( ii ) high cleaning efficiency ; ( iii ) high geometrical stability , to maintain the precision of the collimator jaw during operation despite temperature changes ; and ( iv ) high structural robustness , in case of accidental events , such as single - turn losses .",
    "the current baseline for the upgraded secondary collimators relies on novel carbon - based materials , such as molybdenum carbide - graphite ( mogr ) , a ceramic composite jointly developed by cern and brevetti bizz , in which the presence of carbides and carbon fibres strongly catalyses the graphitic ordering of carbon during high - temperature processing , enhancing its thermal and electrical properties ( ) . to further improve their surface electrical conductivity , these materials could be coated with pure molybdenum or other lower-@xmath101 refractory coatings .",
    "replacing all existing cfc secondary collimators in both ir7 and ir3 with bulk mogr or mogr coated with @xmath84 thick pure molybdenum would reduce the total lhc impedance by 40% or 60% , respectively .    ) and jaw absorbing block ( @xmath102 ) are shown .",
    "a jaw assembly includes two jaw extremities ( taperings ) and eight blocks .",
    "right : detail of microstructure ; the graphite matrix is visible , together with molybdenum carbide grains of about @xmath84 . courtesy of a.  bertarelli.,width=491 ]    the new collimator design , along with novel materials and possible alternative coatings must be validated for operation in the lhc .",
    "for these purposes , a rich programme of validation is in progress , involving tests at the cern hiradmat facility @xcite , to address robustness against beam impact , mechanical engineering prototyping , beam tests at the lhc , and experimental verification of the material response under high radiation doses .",
    "it is anticipated that this test will be completed , and the production of new , low - impedance , highly robust collimators in the lhc started , by 2019 .",
    "the 2012 operation experience indicates that the lhc collimation would profit from halo control mechanisms .",
    "the idea is that , by controlling the diffusion speed of halo particles in an aperture range between the core and the tcp opening ( @xmath103@xmath104 ) , one can act on the time profile of the losses .",
    "the main goal is to reduce loss rates that would otherwise take place in a short time , or simply to control the static population of halo particles in a certain aperture range .",
    "for example , it is expected that losses caused by orbit drifts @xcite during the squeeze ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_lt_meas ] and [ fig_lt_sq ] ) can be strongly reduced by actively depleting the halo population .",
    "one of the best candidate techniques for achieving active halo control at the lhc is to use the hollow e - lens collimation concept @xcite .",
    "a hollow electron beam , running coaxially to the proton or ion beam , is used to generate an annular beam in the transverse @xmath105 plane .",
    "this hollow beam induces an electromagnetic field , which affects halo particles above a certain transverse amplitude and can change their transverse speed .",
    "the working principle is illustrated in .",
    "a solid experimental basis achieved at the tevatron indicates that this solution is very promising for the lhc .",
    "the design for an hollow e - lens for the lhc is ongoing ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "conversely , in the case of loss spike limitations at the lhc during run  ii , the hollow e - lens solution would not be viable because it could only be implemented over a time - scale of a few years @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , crucial to work on alternatives that , if necessary , might be implemented on an appropriate time - scale .",
    "two alternatives are currently being considered : tune modulation through noise in the current of lattice quadrupoles , as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and narrow - band excitation of halo particles , using the transverse damper system .",
    "though very different from the hardware point of view , both these techniques rely on exciting tail particles through resonances induced in the tune space .",
    "this method works on the assumption that there is a correlation between halo particles with large amplitudes and corresponding tune shifts in tune space ( de - tuning with amplitude ) .",
    "clearly , both methods require solid experimental verification in a very low noise machine , like the lhc , in particular , to demonstrate that these types of excitation do not perturb the beam core emittance . unlike hollow e - lenses , which act directly in the transverse plane by affecting particles at amplitudes above the inner radius of the hollow beam , resonance excitation methods require a good knowledge of the beam core and tail particle tunes , even in dynamic phases of the operational cycle .",
    "it is planned to test these techniques experimentally in lhc run  ii .",
    "highly pure bent crystals can be used to steer high - energy particles that become trapped between the potential of parallel lattice planes @xcite .",
    "equivalent bending fields of up to hundreds of teslas can be achieved in crystals with a length of only 3@xmath106 , enabling , in principle , halo particles to be steered to a well - defined point , with obvious potential applications to beam collimation . as opposed to standard primary collimators based on amorphous materials , which require several secondary collimators and absorbers to catch the products developed through the interaction with matter ( ) , one single absorber per collimation plane",
    "is , in theory , sufficient in a crystal - based collimation system .",
    "this is shown in .",
    "in addition to the reduction of secondary collimators , nuclear interactions with well - aligned crystals are much reduced compared with a primary collimator , provided that high channelling efficiencies of halo particles can be achieved ( particles impinging on the crystal are to be channelled within a few turns ) .",
    "this is expected to reduce dispersive beam losses in the dispersion suppressor of the betatron cleaning insertion significantly , compared with the existing system , which is limited by the leakage of particles from the primary collimators .",
    "simulations indicate a possible gain of between 5 and 10 @xcite , even for a layout without an optimized absorber design .",
    "the crystal collimation option is particularly interesting for collimation of heavy - ion beams , thanks to the reduced probability of ion dissociation and fragmentation compared with current primary collimators .",
    "another potential of crystal collimation is a strong reduction of the machine impedance , since ( 1 ) only a small number of collimator absorbers is required and ( 2 ) the absorbers can be spaced much farther apart , owing to the large bending angle from the crystal ( 40@xmath107 instead of a few microradians from multiple coulomb scattering in the primary collimator ) .",
    "conversely , an appropriate absorber design must be conceived to handle the design peak loss rates , of @xmath108 during @xmath55 , expected for the lhc upgrade @xcite .",
    "other potential issues concern the machine protection aspects of this scheme , which has not yet been studied in detail , and operational aspects for crystals that require mechanical angular stability in the submicroradian range through the operational cycle .",
    "note that the critical angle beyond which channelling is lost is @xmath109 at @xmath76 .",
    "promising results were achieved in dedicated crystal collimation tests at the sps , performed from 2009 within the ua9 experiment @xcite .",
    "however , some outstanding issues on the feasibility of the crystal collimation concept for the lhc can only be addressed by beam tests at high energy in the lhc . for this purpose ,",
    "a study at the lhc has been proposed , and will take place in the lhc run  ii @xcite .",
    "tests at the lhc will address the feasibility of the crystal collimation concept with lhc beam conditions , in particular , to demonstrate that such a system can provide better cleaning than the present high - performance system throughout the operational cycle .",
    "the material presented here is the result of the work of many people and was presented on behalf of the lhc collimation project team .",
