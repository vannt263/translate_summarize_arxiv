    "radiative decays of vector mesons have traditionally been a good laboratory for various tests of the quark model and su(3 ) symmetry @xcite . a recent discovery of the @xmath5 decay by the cmd-2 group @xcite has been the last link in the otherwise complete picture of radiative magnetic dipole transitions between light vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this observation was later confirmed by the snd group @xcite . both experiments suffered from a low number of observed events , resulting in large uncertainties in the determined branching ratio and making comparison to theory difficult .",
    "in this paper we report on the improved measurement of the rate of the @xmath5 decay based upon the total data sample accumulated with cmd-2 in the @xmath6-meson energy range .",
    "it includes 3.1 pb@xmath1 of data collected in 1992  1996 in our first measurement which used only photons observed in the csi barrel calorimeter , and about 11.4 pb@xmath1 collected in 1997  1998 .",
    "in addition , this analysis uses photons detected in either the csi barrel or the bgo endcap calorimeters for both data samples providing better detection efficiency than before .",
    "the general purpose detector cmd-2 operating at the high luminosity @xmath7 collider vepp-2 m in novosibirsk has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it consists of a drift chamber and proportional z - chamber used for trigger , both inside a thin ( 0.4 @xmath8 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t.    the barrel calorimeter placed outside the solenoid consists of 892 csi crystals of @xmath9 @xmath10 size and covers polar angles from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the energy resolution for photons is about 9% in the energy range from 50 to 600 mev .",
    "the end - cap calorimeter placed inside the solenoid consists of 680 bgo crystals of @xmath13 @xmath10 size and covers forward - backward polar angles from 16@xmath14 to 49@xmath14 and from 131@xmath14 to 164@xmath14 .",
    "the energy and angular resolution are equal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 radians respectively .",
    "the luminosity was determined from the detected @xmath17 events @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 is a two - body decay and @xmath18 is a narrow state , the momentum of the recoil photon is fixed and approximately equals 60 mev .    to study this decay we searched for the decay chain @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the photons are ordered by decreasing energy ( @xmath21 ) . in these events",
    "the softest photon must be a monochromatic recoil photon with the energy @xmath22 mev at the @xmath6 meson peak , while the energies of the harder ones range from 170 to 440 mev .",

    "the main source of background for this study is the decay mode @xmath24 giving the same final state with two charged pions and three photons via the decay chain @xmath25 , @xmath26 . here",
    "the hardest photon is monochromatic with @xmath27 mev and the invariant mass of two others is @xmath28 .",
    "this decay can be used as a monitoring process and the branching ratio @xmath29 will be calculated relative to @xmath30 . due to similar kinematics and detection efficiency dependence on detector parameters some systematic errors will cancel in such a ratio .",
    "events with two tracks and three photons were selected using the following criteria :    *   one vertex is found in the event *   two tracks with opposite charges are reconstructed from this vertex and there are no other tracks *   the angles of both tracks with respect to the beam are limited by @xmath31 to match the optimal drift chamber coverage *   the number of photons detected in the csi and bgo calorimeters is three . the cluster in the calorimeter is accepted as a photon when it does not match any charged track and its energy is more than 30 mev in the csi calorimeter or more than 40 mev in the bgo calorimeter . *   the distance from each track to the beam @xmath32 cm *   the distance from the vertex to the interaction point along the beam direction @xmath33 cm * the space angle between the tracks @xmath34 * the angle between the tracks in the r-@xmath35 plane @xmath36 *   the total energy of the charged particles ( assuming that both particles are charged pions ) @xmath37 mev .",
    "the events thus selected were subject to the kinematical reconstruction assuming energy - momentum conservation .",
    "events with good quality of the reconstruction were selected by the following criteria :    * @xmath38 * the ratio of the photon energy measured in the calorimeter @xmath39 to that from the constrained fit @xmath40 is @xmath41 * @xmath42 mev     vs hardest photon energy @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig : etpr]b .",
    "the result of the fit is @xmath72 .    using the number of events from the fit",
    ", one can calculate the relative branching ratio :    @xmath73 +    where the values of the branching ratios of @xmath74 and @xmath75 were taken from @xcite .    a separate analysis of the normalizing decay @xmath24",
    "has recently been published @xcite , with a branching ratio of @xmath76 consistent with previous measurements @xcite and thus giving confidence in the analysis presented here . in the above calculation of the relative branching ratio common systematic errors such as luminosity determination cancel exactly , while others such as detector inefficiency and evaluation of radiative corrections cancel approximately .",
    "finally , using the value of @xmath77 from @xcite , one obtains :    @xmath78 .",
    "the last error is our estimate of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the sources of systematic errors are the following :    * uncertainties in the ratio @xmath79 caused by different energy spectra for final photons and pions - 10% ; * uncertainties in the branching ratios @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 - 6.3% ; * determination of the background shape  5% ; * different resonance shape caused by different energy dependence of the phase space - 2% ;    the total systematic error obtained by adding separate contributions quadratically is 13% .",
    "the results of our analysis have higher statistical significance than before since they are based on a data sample of 21 selected events compared to 6 events in our previous work @xcite and 5 events observed by snd @xcite .",
    "the obtained value of the branching ratio @xmath84    @xmath85 . +    agrees with our previous result based on part of the whole data sample @xcite    @xmath86 +    as well as with the result of the snd group @xcite    @xmath87 +    and is more precise . within experimental accuracy",
    "it is also consistent with the preliminary result of cmd-2 based on other decay modes of the @xmath88 meson ( @xmath89 ) with four charged pions and two or more photons in the final state @xcite :    @xmath90 .",
    "analysis of the available data sample of the produced @xmath6 mesons by both cmd-2 and snd and full use of other decay modes of the @xmath18 and @xmath88 mesons will further improve the statistical error .",
    "much larger increase can be expected from the da@xmath91ne @xmath6-factory where one plans to accumulate the number of @xmath6 mesons by at least two orders of magnitude higher than ours .",
    "let us briefly discuss theoretical predictions for the decay under study .",
    "usual methods of the description of radiative decays are based on the nonrelativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "various ways of incorporating effects of su(3 ) breaking have been suggested leading to the values of @xmath29 in the range @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the value of the branching ratio studied in our work is also of interest for the problem of @xmath93 mixing which has been a subject of intense investigation for a long time @xcite .",
    "it is sensitive to the structure of the @xmath18 wave function or , in other words , to the contribution of various @xmath94 states as well as the possible admixture of glue in it @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "a branching ratio @xmath95 would indicate a substantial glue component in the @xmath18 , while the expected branching ratio is less than @xmath96 for a pure gluonium",
    ". even smaller values were obtained in @xcite assuming a specific model of qcd violation .    the revival of interest to the problem of the @xmath18 structure and possible contents of glue in it ( see @xcite and references therein ) was partially due to two recent observations by cleo involving the @xmath18 meson : in @xcite it was shown that the transition form factor of the @xmath18 studied in the two photon processes strongly differs from those for the @xmath75 and @xmath88 mesons and in @xcite the unexpectedly high magnitude of the rate of @xmath97 was observed .",
    "however , in a recent paper @xcite it is claimed that it is impossible to disentangle the effects of the nonet symmetry breaking and those of glue inside the @xmath18 .",
    "most of the models mentioned above are able to describe the data reasonably well in terms of some number of free parameters which , unfortunately , can not be determined from first principles .",
    "an attempt to overcome this drawback was made in @xcite where radiative decays of light vector mesons are considered in the approach based on qcd sum rules @xcite and the value @xmath98 is obtained for the branching ratio of @xmath5 decay .",
    "one can summarize that the variety of theoretical approaches to the problem of the description of the @xmath6 meson radiative decay to @xmath99 is rather broad and more theoretical insight into the problem is needed .",
    "using an almost five times bigger data sample than in the first measurement the cmd-2 group confirmed the observation of the rare radiative decay @xmath100 .",
    "the measured branching ratio is :    @xmath78 .",
    "+    its value is consistent with most of the theoretical predictions based on the quark model and assuming a standard quark structure of the @xmath18 .",
    "it rules out exotic models suggesting a high glue admixture @xcite or strong qcd violation @xcite .",
    "further progress in this field can be expected after the dramatic increase of the number of produced @xmath6 mesons expected at the da@xmath91ne @xmath6-factory and refinement of theoretical models of radiative decays .",
