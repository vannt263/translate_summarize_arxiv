    "quasi - one dimensional organic @xcite and inorganic @xcite materials have been the object of an important theoretical interest for the last three decades .",
    "the essential features of their phase diagram may be captured by the anisotropic hubbard model ( ahm ) ,    @xmath1    or a more general hubbard - like model including longer range coulomb interactions .",
    "the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 label the sites and the chains respectively . for these highly anisotropic materials , @xmath4 . over the years",
    ", the ahm has remained a formidable challenge to condensed - matter theorists .",
    "some important insights on this model or its low energy version , the g - ology model , have been obtained through the work of bourbonnais and caron @xcite and others .",
    "they used a perturbative renormalization group approach to analyze the crossover from 1d to 2d at low temperatures .",
    "more recently , biermann et al .",
    "@xcite applied the chain dynamical mean - field approach to study the crossover from luttinger liquid to fermi liquid in this model . despite this important progress ,",
    "crucial information such as the ground - state phase diagram , or most notably , whether the ahm displays superconductivity , are still unknown .",
    "so far it has remained beyond the reach of numerical methods such as the exact diagonalization ( ed ) or the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods .",
    "ed can not exceed lattices of about @xmath5 .",
    "it is likely to remain so for many years unless there is a breakthrough in quantum computations .",
    "the qmc method is plagued by the minus sign problem and will not be helpful at low temperatures .",
    "the small value of @xmath6 implies that , in order to see the 2d behavior , it will be necessary to reach lower temperatures than those usually studied for the isotropic 2d hubbard model .",
    "hence , even in the absence of the minus sign problem , in order to work in this low temperature regime , the qmc algorithm requires special stabilization schemes which lead to prohibitive cpu time .",
    "i have shown in ref .   that this class of anisotropic models may be studied using a two - step density - matrix renormalization group ( tsdmrg ) method .",
    "the tsdmrg method is a perturbative approach in which the standard 1d dmrg is applied twice . in the first step ,",
    "the usual 1d dmrg method @xcite is applied to find a set of low lying eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8 of a single chain . in the second step , the 2d hamiltonian",
    "is then projected onto the basis constructed from the tensor product of the @xmath8 s .",

    "they are given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 represents the total number of fermions from sites @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "for each chain , operators for all the sites are stored in a single matrix    @xmath19    since the in - chain degrees of freedom have been integrated out , the interchain couplings are between the block matrix operators in eq .",
    "(  [ bm1 ] ,  [ bm2 ] ) which depend only on the chain index @xmath3 . in this matrix notation ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is one - dimensional and it is also studied by the dmrg method .",
    "the only difference compared to a normal 1d situation is that the local operators are now @xmath20 matrices , where @xmath21 is the number of states kept during the second step .",
    "the two - step method has previously been applied to anisotropic two - dimensional heisenberg models.@xcite in ref .  , it was applied to the @xmath22 model but due to the absence of an exact result in certain limits , it was tested against ed results on small ladders only .",
    "a systematic analysis of its performance on a fermionic model on 2d lattices of various size has not been done . in this paper , as a prelude to the study of the ahm , i will apply the tsdmrg to the anisotropic tight - binding model on a 2d lattice , i.e. , model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "i perform a comparison with the exact result of the tight - binding model .",
    "i was able to obtain agreement for the ground - state energies on the order of @xmath24 for lattices of up to @xmath0 .",
    "i then discuss how these calculations may be extended to the interacting case , before presenting the @xmath25 results .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is diagonal in the momentum space , the single particle energies are ,    @xmath26    with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for open boundary conditions ( obc ) ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 are respectively the linear dimensions of the lattice in the parallel and transverse directions .",
    "the ground - state energy of an @xmath32 electron system is obtained by filling the lowest states up to the fermi level , @xmath33}(n)=\\sum_{k < k_f }   \\epsilon_k$ ] . however in real space , this problem is not trivial and it constitutes , for any real space method such as the tsdmrg , a test having the same level of difficulty as the case with @xmath34 .",
    "this is because the term involving @xmath35 is diagonal in real space and the challenge of diagonalizing the ahm arises from the hopping term .",
    "i will study the tight - binding model at quarter filling , @xmath36 , the nominal density of the organic conductors known as the bechgaard salts .",
    "systems of up to @xmath37 will be studied . during the first step ,",

    "]    [ density ]    for the tight - binding model , the chains remain disconnected if @xmath47 or @xmath48 , where @xmath43 is the number of electons on single chain . in order to observe transverse motion ,",

    "these two conditions are satisfied only if @xmath51 is appropietly chosen .",
    "the values listed in table ( [ param ] ) corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "this treshold varies with @xmath53 .",
    "i give in table ( [ param ] ) the values of @xmath6 chosen for different lattice sizes . in principle , for the tsdmrg to be accurate , it is necessary that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the cut - off , be such that @xmath56 .",
    "but in practice , i find that i can achieve accuracy up to the fourth digit even if @xmath57 using the finite system method .",
    "five sweeps were necessary to reach convergence . note that this conclusion is somewhat different from my earlier estimate of @xmath58 for spin systems .",
    "@xcite this is because in ref .  , i used the infinite system method during the second step .",
    "the ultimate success of the tsdmrg depends on the density of the low - lying states in the 1d model . for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath53",
    ", it is , for instance , easier to reach larger @xmath59 in the anisotropic spin one - half heisenberg model , studied in ref .  ,",

    "hence , the tsdmrg method will be more accurate for a spin model than for the tight - binding model . using the infinite system method during the second step on the anisotropic heisenberg model with @xmath64",
    ", i can now reach an agreement of about @xmath40 with the stochastic qmc method .    .transverse hopping and chemical potential used in the simulations for different lattice sizes [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to conclude this section , as a first step to the investigation of interacting electron models ,",
    "i have shown that the tsdmrg can successfuly be applied to the tight - binding model .",
    "the agreement with the exact result is very good and can be improved since the computational power involved in this study was modest .",
    "the extension to the ahm with @xmath25 is straightforward .",
    "there is no additional change in the algorithm since the term involving @xmath35 is local and thus treated during the 1d part of the tsdmrg .",

    ", @xmath65 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath35 . for @xmath61 and @xmath66",

    "]    [ rolu ]",
    "i now proceed to the study of @xmath25 .",
    "one of the main motivations for such a study is the possibility to gain insight into the mechanism of superconductivity in quasi 1d systems .",
    "the mechanism of superconductivity in the quasi 1d organic materials bechgaard and fabre salts , is still an open issue .",
    "@xcite since these materials are 1d above a crossover temperature @xmath69 , it is broadly accepted that the starting point for the the understanding of their low @xmath70 behavior should be pure 1d physics .",
    "the occurence of the low @xmath70 ordered phases is driven by the interchain hopping @xmath6 .",
    "two main hypotheses have been suggested concerning superconductivity . the first hypothesis ( see a recent review in ref .",
    ") relies on a more conventional physics : @xmath6 drives the system to a 2d electron gas which is an anisotropic fermi liquid which becomes superconductive through a conventional bcs mechanism .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that given the smallness of @xmath6 , the resulting electron - phonon coupling would not be enough to account for the observed @xmath71 .",
    "the second hypothesis , which has gained strength over the years given the absence of a clear phonon signature , is that the pairing mechanism originates from an exchange of spin fluctuation .",
    "@xcite    interest in this issue was recently revived by the nmr knight shift experimental finding that the symmetry of the cooper pairs is triplet @xcite in @xmath72 .",
    "no shift was found in the magnetic susceptibility at the transition for measurement made under a magnetic field of about 1.4 _",
    "tesla_. a triplet pairing scenario was subsequently supported by the persistence of superconductivity under fields far exceeding the pauli breaking - pair limit @xcite .",
    "however there is no simple explanation of this scenario .",
    "triplet pairing would be unfavorable in a bcs like scenario for which a singlet s - wave is most likely .",
    "triplet pairing is also less likely in the spin fluctuation mechanism for which a singlet d - wave is predicted by anlytical rg@xcite or by perturbative approaches @xcite .",
    "it has be argued that these difficulties in both mechanisms can be circumvented . in the bcs case , the association of afm fluctuations with an open fermi surface to the electron - phonon mechanism may lead to a triplet pairing @xcite . in the spin fluctuation case ,",
    "the addition of interchain coulomb interactions may favor a triplet f - wave in lieu of the singlet d - wave @xcite .",
    "the more exotic fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov phase can also been invoked to account for the large paramagnetic limit .",
    "however , the knight shift result which was thought to bring a conclusion to this long standing issue has only revived the old controversy .",
    "the conclusion of this experiment itself has been recently challenged . in ref .  , it was pointed out that the observation of triplet superconductivity claimed in ref .",
    "could be a spurious effect due to the lack of thermalization of the samples .",
    "a recent knight shift experimenent performed at lower fields reveals a decrease in the spin susceptibility .",
    "this is consistent with singlet pairing.@xcite     for @xmath73 ( circles ) , @xmath74 ( squares ) . ]",
    "[ green ]     for @xmath73 ( circles ) , @xmath74 ( squares ) . ]    [ magn ]    the 1d interacting electron gas is now fairly well understood .",
    "@xcite there is no phase with long range order .",
    "there are essentially four regions in the phase diagram , characterized by the dominant correlations i.e. , sdw , charge density wave ( cdw ) , singlet superconductivity ( ss ) and triplet superconductivity ( ts ) .",
    "the essential question is whether the interchain hopping will simply freeze the dominant 1d fluctuation into long - range order ( lro ) or create new 2d physics .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath35 and @xmath75 for the bechgaard salts suggest that they are in the sdw region in their 1d regime .",
    "this suggests that superconductivity in these materials is a 2d phenomenon .",
    "interchain pair tunneling was suggested soon after the discovery of superconductivity in an organic compound.@xcite emery argued instead that a mechanism similar to the kohn - luttinger mechanism might be responsible for superconductivity in the organic materials .",
    "when @xmath6 is turned on , pairing can arise from exchange of short - range sdw fluctuations .",
    "the reason is that the oscillating sdw susceptibility at @xmath76 would have an attractive region if @xmath77 . in particular if @xmath78 as i found , then the interaction would be attractive between particles in neighboring chains . in this study , i will restrain myself to the study of interchain pair tunneling .",
    "i was unable to compute correlation functions of pairs in which each electron belongs to a different chain .",
    "the reason is that in the dmrg method , for the correlation functions to be accurate , at least two different blocks should be involved .",
    "this means that for pair correlation for which each electron of the pair is on a different chain , at least four blocks are needed .",
    "however , the introduction of four blocks in the second step of the tsdmrg leads to a prohibitive cpu time .    with the hope of frustrating an sdw ordering which is usually expected",
    ", i will add an extra terms to model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "these are the diagonal interchain hopping ,    @xmath79    and the next - nearrest neighbor interchain hopping ,    @xmath80    i will also add the interchain coulomb interaction ,    @xmath81    i set @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath66 , and @xmath84 . a second set of calculations with @xmath85 , same values of @xmath38 and @xmath21 , and @xmath86 lead to the same conclusions .",
    "therefore , they will not be shown here . in order to analyze the physics induced by the transverse couplings , i compute the following interchain correlations : the transverse single - particle green s function , shown in fig.[green ] , @xmath87 the transverse spin - spin correlation function , shown in fig.[magn ] ,    @xmath88    the transverse local pairs singlet superconductive correlation , shown in fig.[sups ] ,    @xmath89     for @xmath73 ( circles ) , @xmath74 ( squares ) . ]",

    "these two - particle correlation functions are roughly given by the average values @xmath100 and @xmath101 for an on - site pair created at @xmath102 and then destroyed at @xmath103 .",
    "it is expected that the dominant two - particle correlation are sdw with @xmath78 .",
    "this is seen in fig.([magn]-[supd ] ) .",
    "the transverse pairing correlations are all found to be small with respect to @xmath104 . among the pairing correlations",
    ", @xmath105 decays faster then @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these results are consistent with the view that the role of @xmath6 is to freeze the dominant 1d correlations into lro .    when @xmath108 , it is expected that for a strong enough @xmath109 , the magnetic order will vanish because of the frustration induced by @xmath109 .",
    "a simple argument is that @xmath109 induces an afm exchange between next - nearest neigbhors on chains @xmath3 and @xmath110 which compete with the afm exchange between nearest neigbhors .",
    "the hope is that there could be a region of the phase diagram where superconductivity could ultimately win either by pair tunneling between the chains or by the emery s mechanism .",
    "however , in fig.([magn]-[supd ] ) it can be seen that , while @xmath109 slightly reduces @xmath104 , the dominant correlations are still sdw even for a strong @xmath111 . @xmath112 and",
    "@xmath107 are barely affected by @xmath109 .",
    "the fact that @xmath109 does not strongly affect the sdw order can be understood in the light of recent study of coupled @xmath22 chains @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the frustration strongly suppresses magnetic lro only close to half - filling . for large dopings ,",
    "two neighboring spins in a chain do not always points to opposite direction as the consequence , @xmath109 does not necessarily frustrate the magnetic order .",
    "this is illustrated in a simple sketch in fig.([frust ] ) .",
    "@xmath109 could even enhance it as seen in the study of @xmath22 chains . in fig.[green ]",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath109 enhances @xmath113 .",
    "this enhancement , together with the decrease of @xmath104 , suggests a possible widening of an eventual fermi liquid region at finite t above the ordered phase .",
    "when @xmath114 , i also found ( not shown ) that magnetic correlation are not effectively suppressed even when @xmath115 .",
    "for this value , it would be expected that the ratio of the effective exchange term generated by @xmath116 to that generated by @xmath6 is about one quarter . in the frustrated @xmath117 spin chain ,",
    "a spin gap opens around this ratio .",
    "this simple picture does not seem to work here .     for @xmath73 ( circles ) , @xmath74 ( squares ) .",

    "i set @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath82 , @xmath73 , and @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the interchain coulomb interaction between nearest neighbors .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[magn2 ] that @xmath104 is now strongly reduced with respect to its strong coupling values .",
    "it is already within our numerical error for the next - nearest neighbor in the transverse direction .",
    "this is an indication that the ground state is probably not an sdw .",
    "it is to be noted that this occurs even in the absence of @xmath109 or @xmath116 .",
    "this seems to be at variance with the rg analysis which requires @xmath116 to destroy the magnetic order .",
    "a possible explanation of this is that at half - filling the perfect nesting occurs at the wave vector @xmath124 for the spectrum of equation ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "away from half - filling the nesting is no longer perfect this leads to the reduction of magnetic correlations .",
    "the first correction to the nesting is an effective frustration term which is roughly @xmath125 .",
    "this expression is identical to a term that could be generated by an explicit frustration @xmath126 .",
    "the discrepancy between the tsdmrg and the rg results could be that this nesting deviation is underevaluated in the rg analysis .",
