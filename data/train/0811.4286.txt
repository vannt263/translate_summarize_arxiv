    "the goal of this paper is to collect some information about known maps between deligne - mostow ball quotients of various dimensions .",
    "only one map given here is new ( it gives a non - trivial map from a @xmath1-dimensional ball quotient to a compact riemann surface ) , but we also find it worthwhile to commit to print the fact that forgetful maps ( in the sense of the present paper , see section  [ sec : forgetful ] ) can not yield any other examples .",
    "the simplest examples of holomorphic maps between ball quotients are given by unbranched coverings , obtained simply by taking subgroups of finite index of the fundamental group of the relevant ball quotient .",
    "another class of examples is given by totally geodesic maps , which are also easily constructed between ball quotients of any dimension .",
    "in fact , it is well known that there are many holomorphic totally geodesic inclusions between deligne - mostow quotients , and we only briefly review how to describe those maps in proposition  [ prop : inclusions ] .    another way to obtain non - trivial holomorphic maps is to construct branched coverings .",
    "this can of course easily be done for riemann surfaces , which appear in the present paper in the form of surjective homomorphisms between various triangle groups . in higher dimensions",
    "however , simple branched coverings of ball quotients can not be ball quotients themselves ( see the computation of characteristic classes that comes up in the mostow - siu construction , see  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) , and it is not clear how to determine whether a given ball quotient admits branched coverings ( simple or not ) .",
    "note that the maps between complex hyperbolic surfaces constructed by mostow and toledo ( see  @xcite ) are certainly not simple branched coverings , in fact they branch around certain complex totally geodesic curves , but they also contract some such curves .",
    "finally , one might hope to get certain ball quotients to fiber over ball quotients , and this was first achieved by livn in his thesis , see  @xcite .",
    "his ball quotient are actually closely related to some of the deligne - mostow lattices , see  16 of  @xcite , and the corresponding fibrations can then be interpreted in terms of the forgetful map construction presented in this paper ; this remark was the basis for the construction of maps to riemann surfaces used in the author s thesis ( see  @xcite ) . as mentioned above , in this paper",
    ", we show that the forgetful map construction can be generalized to give a similar fibration of a @xmath1-dimensional compact ball quotient to a riemann surface , but we do not know of any method to obtain fibrations for higher - dimensional examples .    the main result of this paper can be thought as shedding some light on the general question of existence of surjective holomorphic map @xmath3 between compact ball quotients when @xmath4 ( see the question raised by siu in  @xcite , p.  182 ) .",
    "one might think of the statement of  theorem  [ thm : main ] as giving some evidence for the non - existence of such maps , but note that the ball quotients considered here are not particularly representative ( there are only finitely many deligne - mostow ball quotients in dimension @xmath5 ) , and we are only considering a very specific construction of maps between them .",
    "our results should also be put in perspective with a recent result of koziarz and mok , see  @xcite , that precludes the existence of _ submersive _ holomorphic maps between ball quotients .",
    "the maps obtained in this paper are indeed not submersive , and some explicit fibers are in fact singular divisors .",
    "it should be pointed out that the ball with its bergman metric is a _ rank one _ hermitian symmetric space , which makes it very different from irreducible higher rank hermitian symmetric spaces .",
    "indeed , if @xmath6 is a compact manifold modelled on a higher rank bounded symmetric domain @xmath7 , then there is no surjective holomorphic map from @xmath8 onto any nonpositively curved hermitian manifold apart from geodesic coverings ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting feature of some of the maps that appear in this paper is that they exhibit a retraction of the relevant ball quotient onto one of its totally geodesic submanifolds . in the context of _ real _ hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "such retractions have been obtained for certain arithmetic real hyperbolic manifolds ( see  @xcite ) , without any restriction on the dimension .",
    "this paper was written as an answer to various questions asked over the years by domingo toledo , sai - kee yeung and ngaiming mok , whom the author wishes to thank for their interest in this work .",
    "the existence of a map from a @xmath1-ball quotient to a compact hyperbolic riemann surface as in theorem  [ thm : main]([it:3dim ] ) was also known to sai - kee yeung .",
    "we start by collecting some facts from deligne - mostow theory ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , following the exposition in  @xcite .",
    "we state only what is needed for the purpose of this paper ( for a more thorough survey see  @xcite for instance ) .    given an integer @xmath9 ,",
    "we would like to consider various structures on the moduli space of @xmath10 points on @xmath0 . in order to form a geometric invariant theory quotient of @xmath11",
    ", we need to pick a line bundle @xmath12 on @xmath11 and a lift of the @xmath13-action to @xmath12 ( we refer to this data as a polarization ) .",

    "the line bundle @xmath17 on @xmath11 associated to @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the common denominator of the @xmath21 ( see section  4.6 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding geometric invariant theory quotient has a simple description , as we now recall .",
    "we define @xmath22 to be the set of @xmath15-tuples of pairwise distinct points on @xmath0 , and the following chain of subsets @xmath23 of @xmath11 by allowing only certain coincidences of points .",
    "@xmath24 denotes the subset of @xmath15-tuples where we allow coincidence of points only when the sum of the corresponding weights is @xmath25 .",
    "the set @xmath26 is defined similarly , allowing coincidence of points whose weights add up to @xmath27 .    for each strictly semistable point @xmath28 , there is a unique partition @xmath29 such that for some @xmath30 or @xmath31 , the points @xmath32 with indices @xmath33 coincide .",

    "recall that the list of @xmath187-tuples satisfying condition @xmath97int is finite for @xmath235 ( it can be found in  @xcite , for instance ) , but there are infinitely many @xmath236-tuples that satisfy @xmath97int ( corresponding to the fact that there are inifinitely many hyperbolic triangle groups ) .    however , from the translation in terms of divisibility conditions of proposition  [ prop : lifttocovers ] ( see the end of section  [ sec : lifttocovers ] ) , one easily gets a bound on the least common denominator of the target weights , so in order to get maps to strictly smaller dimension , we need only consider finitely many @xmath2-dimensional moduli spaces as targets . specifically ,",
    "since all @xmath97int @xmath237-tuples with @xmath238 have least common denominator @xmath239 , in order to get maps from dimension @xmath186 to dimension @xmath187 with @xmath240 , we need only consider @xmath236-tuples with denominators @xmath241 .",
    "[ prop : divisibility ] suppose @xmath115 and @xmath176 satisfy the compatibility conditions of lemma  [ lem : compat ] and the divisibility conditions  . if @xmath58 is cocompact and @xmath242 , then up to obvious commensurabilities and symmetry , the pair @xmath243 is one of the following : @xmath244 @xmath245 @xmath246    note that the first two cases are essentially identical , since the groups for @xmath247 and @xmath248 are isomorphic because the sum of their respective weights is one ( see remark  [ rk : duality ] ) .    proposition  [ prop : divisibility ] is proved by direct case by case verification ( reduced to a finite problem because of the discussion of the beginning of this section ) .",
    "the author did this by writing a computer program that generates all deligne - mostow sets of weights , as well as their permutations ( or rather all essential permutations , meaning that we take the symmetry of the weights into account ) .",
    "for a given pair @xmath18 , @xmath249 , it is of course straightforward to check the compatibility and divisibility conditions proposition  [ prop : divisibility ] .",
    "computer code that produces this list is available on the author s webpage , see  @xcite .",
    "we now finish the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "first note that the forgetful map corresponding to @xmath250 , @xmath251 , with @xmath252 does not yield a map of orbifolds , because @xmath133 does not map to @xmath202 .",
    "more specifically , the fixed point sets in @xmath39 and @xmath229 of bitranspositions have codimension one in @xmath229 only , not in @xmath39 ( see lemma  8.3.2 of  @xcite , and also remark  [ rk : fixedpoints](1 ) ) . if the map were a map of orbifolds , the induced homomorphism between the orbifold fundamental groups would have to map the trivial element to a nontrivial one .",
    "finally we need to show that the map @xmath253 for @xmath197 , @xmath198 ( and @xmath254 ) does yield a map of orbifolds .",
    "in that case we clearly have a map @xmath211 , that lifts to monodromy covers because the divisibility condition is satisfied ( see proposition  [ prop : lifttocovers ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in  @xcite , this map has a holomorphic extension to the fox completions @xmath255 because of hartog s theorem , and this extension is still equivariant , so it induces a map of orbifolds @xmath253",
    ".    we shall give a more concrete description of the corresponding map @xmath253 in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "we now give some detail on the example that appears in theorem  [ thm : main ] , part  ( [ it:3dim ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath256 and @xmath257 we shall choose the symmetry groups @xmath114 , @xmath214 to be trivial ( there are several maps obtained for various non - trivial symmetry groups , but as mentioned above , the corresponding groups are commensurable , see the discussion in the end of section  [ sec : halfint ] ) . accordingly",
    ", we use the notation of section  [ sec : int ] rather than of section  [ sec : halfint ] .    note",
    "that @xmath258 is simply a copy of @xmath259 , with three orbifold points ( see  @xcite , p.  29 ) .",
    "the isomorphism is provided simply by the cross ratio @xmath260 which is well - defined as long as no triple of points in @xmath261 coincide ( this never happens in @xmath262 , since any three weights of @xmath249 add up to more that one ) .",
    "now the map that sends @xmath263 to the cross - ratio of @xmath264 , see equation  ( [ eq : crossratio ] ) , is well - defined on @xmath24 ( again because no triple of weights of @xmath18 add up to more that one ) , and clearly descends to @xmath43 .",
    "the following result is contained in theorem  4.1 of  @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is a @xmath0-bundle over @xmath265 , where @xmath265 denotes @xmath266 blown - up at a generic quadruple of points .",
    "consider the map forgetting @xmath267 from @xmath24 into @xmath268 . since the stability condition allows any pair among the first five points to coalesce , @xmath24 maps into @xmath269 , where @xmath270 .",
    "the corresponding quotient @xmath271 is known to be @xmath265 ( which is isomorphic to @xmath272 blown up in three distinct points of the diagonal ) , see  @xcite , example  1 , p.  33",
    "for instance .",
    "it is easy to check that the fibers of the corresponding map @xmath273 are all projective lines , and the stabilizer of a fiber ( for the diagonal action of @xmath13 ) is trivial , so the fibers of the induced map @xmath274 are also projective lines .",
    "@xmath265 is in fact homeomorphic to @xmath275 for various @xmath276-tuples @xmath277 , but the corresponding map @xmath278 is never a map of orbifolds ( see theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "now there is an obvious map @xmath279 , coming from the fibration of @xmath280 over the @xmath0 of lines through @xmath281 ( the former map contracts three of the exceptional divisors of @xmath265 , and maps onto the other exceptional divisor ) .",
    "we claim that the composition @xmath282 can be made into a map of orbifolds , where @xmath0 is the orbifold ball quotient @xmath283 .",
    "we denote by @xmath284 the corresponding holomorphic map .    the set of points of @xmath35 where @xmath285 is not surjective consists of three @xmath0 s , which are the fibers over three points of @xmath265 , represented by the solid dots on figure  [ fig : blowdown ] ( left ) .",
    "note also that the preimage of each of the three singular points on @xmath283 consists of two divisors , for instance @xmath286 and @xmath287 map to the same point in @xmath283 .",
    "we close this section by noting that the divisibility conditions   are trivially satisfied in this example ( recall that we take @xmath114 and @xmath214 to be trivial , so @xmath68 is the same as @xmath147 , etc ) .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath68 is the normal subgroup generated by the @xmath74 , where @xmath53 is either @xmath31 or @xmath236 .",
    "note that @xmath288 only when one of @xmath125 or @xmath106 is equal to @xmath289 , but then the loop @xmath70 has trivial image . since all the @xmath232 are @xmath290 , @xmath68 maps into @xmath291 .",
    "[ rk : singular ] note that the divisors @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , surject onto @xmath296 , whereas the other divisors get mapped to the three orbifold points .",
    "for instance , the fiber over @xmath297 , which corresponds to @xmath298 in @xmath299 , is given by the union of the divisors @xmath300 and @xmath301 in @xmath43 ( these are both projective planes and their intersection is a projective line ) .",
    "the same construction works for non compact moduli spaces , and one gets maps that have the same behavior as the ones between compact ones . here",
    "the divisibility condition is easily adapted to allow for infinite weights if some pairs of weights add up to exactly one .",
    "the list of pairs of weights with symmetry ( at least one of which is non - compact , with @xmath302 or @xmath303 ) that satisfy the compatibility and divisibility conditions is the following :      note that in particular one does not get more pairs @xmath188 of dimensions that are related by a surjective map of orbifolds coming from a forgetful map than in the compact case ; in other words part  ( i ) of the statement of theorem  [ thm : main ] remains true for non - compact examples .",
