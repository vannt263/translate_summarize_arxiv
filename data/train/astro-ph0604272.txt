    "there is a plethora of astrophysical evidence today , from supernovae measurements , the spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryon oscillations and other cosmological data , indicating that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating .",
    "the energy budget of the universe seems to be dominated at the present epoch by a mysterious dark energy component , but the precise nature of this energy is still unknown .",
    "many theoretical models provide possible explanations for the dark energy , ranging from a cosmological constant @xcite to super - horizon perturbations @xcite and time - varying quintessence scenarios @xcite , in which the dark energy is due to a smoothly varying ( scalar ) field which dominates cosmology in the present era , such as a time - dependent dilaton field @xcite .",
    "the current astrophysical data are capable of placing severe constraints on the nature of the dark energy , whose equation of state may be determined by means of an appropriate global fit . most of the analyses so far are based on effective four - dimensional robertson - walker universes , which satisfy on - shell dynamical equations of motion of the einstein - friedman form . even in modern approaches to brane cosmology , which are described by equations that deviate during early eras of the universe from the standard friedman equation ( which is linear in the energy density )",
    ", the underlying dynamics is assumed to be of classical equilibrium ( on - shell ) nature , in the sense that it satisfies a set of equations of motion derived from the appropriate minimization of an effective space - time lagrangian .",
    "however , cosmology may not be an entirely classical equilibrium situation @xcite .",
    "the initial big bang or other catastrophic cosmic event , which led to the initial rapid expansion of the universe , may have caused a significant departure from classical equilibrium dynamics in the early universe , whose signatures may still be present at later epochs including the present era .",
    "three of us ( je , nem , dvn ) have indeed proposed one specific model for the cosmological dark energy which is of this type , being associated with a rolling dilaton field that is a remnant of this non - equilibrium phase , described by a generic non - critical string theory @xcite .",
    "we call this scenario ` q - cosmology '",
    ".    the central purpose of this paper is to confront the present cosmological data on high - redshift supernovae with non - equilibrium cosmologies @xcite , in which the dark energy relaxes at different rates , and compare the results with the predictions of the conventional @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "we also comment on a model with super - horizon perturbations superposed on an underlying einstein - friedman - robertson - walker universe @xcite .",
    "as we explain in more detail below , care must be taken in interpreting the q - cosmology scenario proposed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "since such a non - equilibrium , non - classical theory _ is not described by the equations of motion derived by extremizing an effective space - time lagrangian _ , one must use a more general formalism to make predictions that can be confronted with the current data .",
    "the approach we favour is formulated in the context of string / brane theory @xcite , the best candidate theory of quantum gravity to date .",
    "our approach is based on non - critical ( liouville ) strings @xcite , which offer a mathematically consistent way of incorporating time - dependent backgrounds in string theory .",
    "the basic idea behind such non - critical liouville strings is the following .",
    "usually , in string perturbation theory , the target space dynamics is obtained from a stringy @xmath1-model  @xcite that describes the propagation of strings in classical target - space background fields , including the space - time metric itself .",
    "consistency of the theory requires conformal invariance on the world sheet , in which case the target - space physics is independent of the scale characterising the underlying two - dimensional dynamics .",
    "these conformal invariance conditions lead to a set of target - space equations for the various background fields , which correspond to the einstein / matter equations derived from an appropriate low - energy effective action that is invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "unfortunately , one can not incorporate in this way time - dependent cosmological backgrounds in string theory , since , to low orders in a perturbative expansion in the regge slope @xmath2 , the conformal invariance condition for the metric field would require a ricci - flat target - space manifold , whereas a cosmological background necessarily has a non - vanishing ricci tensor .    to remedy this defect , and thus be able to describe a time - dependent cosmological background in string theory , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that a non - trivial rle should be played by a time - dependent dilaton background .",
    "this approach leads to strings living in numbers of dimensions different from the customary critical number , and was in fact the first physical application of non - critical strings @xcite .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite was subsequently extended @xcite to incorporate off - shell quantum effects and non - conformal string backgrounds describing other non - equilibrium cosmological situations , including catastrophic cosmic events such as the collision of two brane worlds , _",
    "etc_.    in our discussion of such models in this paper , we first review briefly their main predictions .",
    "we then demonstrate the importance of off - shell corrections to the naive equations of motion of non - critical liouville string cosmology , which cause us to modify the naive equations of motion of q - cosmology .",
    "we then demonstrate that the available supernova data are compatible with such non - critical - string - based cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section  [ sec : pheno ] we summarise the basic equations of the first set of models we study , namely @xmath0cdm and the super - horizon model .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : qcosmo ] we discuss the liouville q - cosmology model of refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we discuss technical aspects of q - cosmology , placing the emphasis on the off - shell corrections and deriving the fitting formulae to be used in our analysis .",
    "this part may be omitted by the reader who is more interested in the confrontation of this and other models with the available high - redshift supernova data that we present in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we find that the @xmath0cdm model fits the data very well , as does the super - horizon model .",
    "we also show that the off - shell corrections to the q - cosmology enable this model to be reconciled with the supernova data on equal footing with @xmath0cdm .",
    "our results and the possible outlook are summarised in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we review the basic formulae needed in the phenomenological analysis of observational constraints on the cosmological parameters derived from supernova data and ( in the case of the @xmath0cdm ) also baryon acoustic oscillations , in the context of on - shell models ( i.e. , excluding the q - cosmology model to be discussed later ) .",

    "in such a model with @xmath40 , the rolling dilaton dark energy would resemble a spatial curvature contribution , and such naive on - shell models are easily excluded on the same observational grounds that support experimentally the spatial flatness of the universe .",

    "indeed , the combined data prefer @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , i.e. , a ( nearly ) constant vacuum energy , as in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in this section we explore in more detail q - cosmologies with relaxing vacuum energy in the context of liouville strings , which provide a consistent treatment of off - shell , out - of - equilibrium effects . for the benefit of the reader , we review here the basic formalism and summarize the results , giving details of their derivation in the next two subsections , that may be skipped by a reader not interested in technical aspects .",
    "there are many specific cosmological models that may be formulated within the general framework of liouville strings : see  @xcite for an extended discussion and references . here",
    "we limit ourselves to the main features of this cosmological framework , which do not depend on the details of the underlying microscopic string / brane models or compactification .",
    "we simply assume the theory to have been compactified ( somehow ) to a four - dimensional robertson - walker space - time , with a scale factor @xmath49 in the so - called einstein cosmic frame @xcite .      in the absence of matter , the liouville - dressing approach of ref .",

    "in contrast , the exotic scaling terms appear positive .    when fitting the data , in order to distinguish ordinary matter from dilaton dark energy effects that scale similarly with the redshift , one would have to perform also measurements of the equation of state of each component , which we do not attempt in this work . in the specific model @xcite",
    "considered here as our pilot study , the values of the various @xmath137 appearing in the expression for @xmath3 are in principle predicted by the underlying microscopic dynamics of the model , as we have seen above , but we leave this exercise for future work .    however ,",
    "since some of the @xmath137 involve highly model - dependent coefficients of string loop corrections and other , currently unknown , details of microscopic models , and , moreover , in the above derivation several assumptions have been made , e.g. , about the form of the potential for the dilaton , the form of the dilaton and the scale factor at late epochs , _ etc .",
    "_ , which may not always be valid @xcite , we consider at present the various parameters appearing in the expression for @xmath3 as arbitrary parameters to be fixed by the data . to be even more general , we keep the exponent of the exotic scaling as a free fitting parameter as well . from the above considerations , in particular , , it is also clear that in general @xmath138 may be negative , as its sign depends on the sign of the corrections to the dilaton potential .    the final result of our parametrisation for @xmath3 in the q - cosmology framework , which will be compared with the astrophysical data in the next section , in order to obtain information on the basic cosmological parameters of the model , is therefore : @xmath139 with the densities @xmath140 corresponding to present - day values ( @xmath141 ) and @xmath142 the reader should recall that in the model described in this section @xmath143",
    ". however , in view of the various approximations employed in our analytic treatment of @xmath55-cosmology above , which , as already mentioned , may not be valid in the present era , when matter contributions are important , the exponent @xmath144 is treated from now on as a fitting parameter .",

    "as explained previously , @xmath146 does not merely represent ordinary matter effects , but also receives contributions from the dilaton dark energy .",
    "in fact , the sign of @xmath146 depends on details of the underlying theory , and it could even be _",
    "negative_. for instance , kaluza - klein graviton modes in certain brane - inspired models @xcite yield negative dust contributions . in a similar vein",
    ", the exotic contributions scaling as @xmath147 are affected by the off - shell liouville terms of q - cosmology .",
    "it is because of the similar scaling behaviours of dark matter and dilaton dark energy that we reverted to the notation @xmath137 , @xmath148 in . to disentangle the ordinary matter and dilaton contributions",
    "one may have to resort to further studies on the equation of state of the various components , which we do not study in this article .",
    "more generally , one could have included a cosmological constant @xmath149 contribution in , which may be induced in certain brane - world inspired models .",
    "we do not do so in this work , as our primary interest is to fit q - cosmology models @xcite , which are characterised by dark energy densities that relax to zero .",
    "we now discuss the observables available to test the above models using mainly data on high - redshift supernovae and ( to a limited extent ) baryon acoustic oscillations .",

    "we note that this observable depends on the expansion history of the universe from @xmath27 to the present epoch , and recall that most of the available supernovae have @xmath154 , though there is a handful with larger values of @xmath27 .    for standard on - shell cosmologies ,",
    "complementary information is provided by the data on baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , which show up in the galaxy - galaxy correlation function at @xmath155 . however , for reasons to be discussed later on in the article , the application of such an analysis to the off - shell q - cosmology model is an open issue , since the underlying theoretical framework needs to be re - evaluated .",
    "the formulae for @xmath3 in the various models discussed above , namely , and , serve as the basis for our analysis below .",
    "we now present our fits of the above models to the presently available astrophysical data on high - redshift supernovae @xcite , and ( in the case of @xmath0cdm ) also baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion with the @xmath0cdm and super - hubble - horizon models , and then proceed to the case of off - shell liouville q - cosmology models @xcite .",

    "however , this was based on a very simple ( linear ) assumed form for the deceleration @xmath178 , which is not the case of our model , as also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deceler ] .",
    "it should be possible in the future to explore observationally nonlinear forms of @xmath179 , with the aim of improving the fit and reducing the uncertainty in the value of the critical @xmath180 for the transition from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the two main data sets for high - redshift supernovae are compatible , at least as far as their constraints on the cosmological models studied in this paper are concerned .",
    "the standard @xmath0cdm model fits the supernova data _ very well _ , and the super - horizon dark matter model also fits the supernova data _ quite well_. both of these models are on - shell , i.e. , they satisfy the pertinent einstein s equations . however , off - shell cosmology models can still be compatible with the data .",
    "as we discussed above , off - shell effects are important in our q - cosmology model .",

    "just as this analysis was being completed , the three - year wmap data ( wmap3 ) were released @xcite . assuming a flat universe , the wmap3 data by themselves yield within the @xmath0cdm model the result @xmath194 .",
    "this central value is slightly lower than our result , but the error is larger , and the two results are compatible within their errors . the wmap collaboration has combined their data with other cmb data , and the most precise result , obtained by combining wmap3 with the 2df galaxy redshift survey , is @xmath195 , which differs from our combined result by about @xmath196 .",
    "on the other hand , combining wmap3 with large - scale structure data gives larger central values of @xmath197 .",
    "the smallest errors are those obtained by combining wmap3 with the sloan digital sky survey lrg data set : @xmath198 and with the cfhtls lensing data : @xmath199 .",
    "these results straddle our combined fit to the supernova data .",
    "the data on baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) provide complementary information @xcite . within the @xmath0cdm model and assuming a flat universe , the bao yield an independent estimate  @xcite @xmath200 , which is completely compatible with the value we obtained from the supernova data . combining the two results , we find @xmath201 .",
    "we leave for a future occasion the exploration of the constraints imposed by the bao data on the q - cosmology models .",
    "when confronting the bao data with the q - cosmology model , it will be desirable also to formulate more precisely the predictions of this model , which is also an important subject for future work .",
    "there is one important issue which should be stressed at this point .",
    "the exotic matter scaling : @xmath202 with @xmath203 of the q - cosmology model at late eras , if valid at earlier times , would have dominated the epochs characterised by redshifts @xmath204 . as a result ,",
    "the positions of the peaks of the baryon acoustic oscillations would have been modified , leading to stringent constraints on the models . however , in such a scenario the phenomenological observables currently used in analyses of the bao  @xcite would be inapplicable to q - cosmology models .",
