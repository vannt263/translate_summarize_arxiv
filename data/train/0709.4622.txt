    "experimental data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) during the past few years have shown convincing evidence for a state of matter with energy densities , @xmath3 , in substantial excess of the expected critical one , i.e. , @xmath4-@xmath5 with @xmath6  gev/@xmath7 . in the standard picture before 2003 the main concern in the study of produced hadrons at high transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) was the underlying modification of partonic spectra due to interactions in such a hot and dense medium , that would reflect in a similar pattern for all hadrons through independent fragmentation .",
    "indeed , one of the most exciting observations at rhic has been the suppression of high-@xmath8  particles in agreement with the non - abelian radiative energy - loss theory within perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite . however , for light hadrons the observations of an anomalous baryon - to - meson production ratio at intermediate @xmath8  up to @xmath9  gev and a scaling of the elliptic flow with the number of quark constituents , has enforced revisions of an independent fragmentation model for hadronization .",
    "instead coalescence processes among massive quarks appear to be a convenient picture that can naturally and quantitatively account for the main features of light hadron production at intermediate @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "for heavy quarks ( charm ( @xmath10 ) and bottom ( @xmath11 ) ) , the energy loss predicted by pqcd  @xcite turned out to be insufficient ( at variance with the light quark case ) to account for the observed large nuclear suppression ( small @xmath12 ) and collectivity ( large @xmath2 ) in non - photonic single - electron spectra  @xcite . here",
    "the challenge is mainly in the understanding of the in - medium quark interactions , even if the acquired knowledge on the hadronization mechanism from light quarks plays a significant role as well .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results suggest that resonance structures survive in meson - correlation functions at moderate temperatures  @xcite above @xmath13 .",
    "two of us have therefore suggested an effective model for heavy - light quark scattering via @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances  @xcite . to study the consequences of such interactions for the modification of the heavy - quark ( hq ) distributions ,",
    "a langevin simulation has been performed to trace the evolution of hq distributions through the fireball in heavy - ion collisions ( hics )  @xcite ; hadronization has been modeled by a coalescence model similar to the one applied to light quarks  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the effect of resonant heavy - light scattering is crucial  @xcite and also provides a reasonable agreement with semileptonic @xmath16 spectra at rhic data  @xcite .",
    "we note that for heavy quarks ( heavy - light ) quark - antiquark resonances provide the dominant medium effects on their distributions close to @xmath13 , which then naturally merges into a coalescence - type description for hadronization processes  @xcite .",
    "hadronization at asymptotically large momentum can be described by a set of fragmentation functions @xmath17 that parametrize , in a universal way , the probability that a hadron @xmath18 with momentum @xmath19 is created from a parton @xmath20 with momentum @xmath21 in the vacuum .",
    "fragmentation functions have been measured in @xmath22 collisions and work well for hadron production at @xmath8 > 2 gev also in @xmath23 collisions at rhic energies .",
    "therefore it was expected that in this @xmath8  regime the qgp could be probed by focusing on modifications of the spectra , @xmath24 , at the parton level ; but from au+au collisions it became clear that this is not the case at least up to @xmath25  gev .",
    "two puzzling observations lead to this conclusion : ( a ) baryons are much more abundant than predicted by fragmentation .",
    "a ratio @xmath26 1 between 2 and 4 gev / c has been measured , see fig .",
    "[ bm ] , much larger than the value of @xmath27  0.2 predicted by leading - twist pqcd .",
    "a similar trend is observed for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 s do not seem to suffer jet quenching .",
    "the pertinent nuclear modification factors , @xmath12 , are close to 1 , unlike those of light mesons for which @xmath32 in central collisions ; ( b ) the elliptic flow of all identified hadrons is found to scale according to a quark - number scaling as reflected in a universal behavior of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of constituent quarks in hadron @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , recent data for the @xmath35 also follow the scaling , suggesting the dominance of the quark content rather than the mass effect , in agreement with the coalescence prescription  @xcite .",
    "[ bm ]   and @xmath36 transverse - momentum spectra in @xmath37=200  agev au+au collisions .",
    "rhic data  @xcite are shown by circles ( @xmath38 ) and squares ( @xmath30 ) , lines are results from coalescence .",
    "right : experiment vs. coalescence results for baryon - to - meson ratios for @xmath28 ( lower part ) and @xmath29 ( upper part).,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath36 transverse - momentum spectra in @xmath37=200  agev au+au collisions .",

    "right : experiment vs. coalescence results for baryon - to - meson ratios for @xmath28 ( lower part ) and @xmath29 ( upper part).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the main reason for the inadequacy of a pure fragmentation picture is the high density of the matter created in hics . in such an environment",
    "one may expect that quarks could just coalesce into hadrons : three quarks into a baryon , a quark - antiquark pair into a meson .",
    "in such a picture baryons with momentum @xmath8  are mainly produced from quarks with momenta @xmath39@xmath8/3 , while mesons with the same momentum mainly arise from quarks with momenta @xmath39@xmath8/2 .",
    "this is contrary to the fragmentation process where baryon production is suppressed with respect to mesons as more quarks are needed from the vacuum . a coalescence model that is based on the simple overlap of the quark - distribution function with a hadron - wave function has been developed to implement the physical ideas sketched above  @xcite .",
    "in such a model the transverse - momentum spectrum of hadrons that consists of @xmath34 ( anti- ) quarks is given by the overlap between the hadron - wave function and @xmath34 quark phase - space distribution functions , @xmath40 : @xmath41 @xmath42 denotes an element of a space - like hadronization hypersurface , @xmath43 is the wigner distribution function of the hadron and @xmath44 the probability of forming a color - neutral object with the spin of the hadron from @xmath34 colored quarks",
    ". therefore it is assumed that the probability of coalescence is simply given by the phase - space distance weighted by the wave function of the produced particle eq .",
    "( [ coal1 ] ) .",
    "in such an approach constituent - quark masses are included representative for non - perturbative effects .",
    "this is a further assumption that can be relaxed for heavy quarks owing to the smaller effect of the qcd vacuum on their masses .",
    "the distributions @xmath45 are fixed as homogeneous boltzmann distributions with an average radial flow @xmath460.35 for @xmath47 gev , and quenched minijets for @xmath48 gev .",
    "the volume is fixed to reproduce the measured transverse energy at given centrality . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ bm ] , the @xmath21 and @xmath49 spectra obtained from the quark - coalescence model are shown together with the experimental data from phenix  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath28 ratio is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ bm ] by lower lines @xcite , a similar effect is seen also for the @xmath29 ratio ( upper lines ) @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions are reached in other studies based on quark coalescence @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks ( @xmath50 ) are produced out of thermal equilibrium in the very early stage of the reaction ; due to their large mass a perturbative evaluation of their in - medium interactions was expected to be reliable also at relatively small @xmath8 . however ,",
    "a small nuclear modification factor , @xmath51 , has been deduced from semileptonic electron spectra associated with decays of @xmath14- and @xmath15-mesons  @xcite , comparable to the pion one .",
    "such a value is incompatible with pqcd jet - quenching mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "this statement is strengthened by the observed @xmath2 of up to 10@xmath52  @xcite , indicating substantial collective behavior of charm ( @xmath10 ) quarks  @xcite . moreover",
    ", a consistent description of @xmath12 and @xmath2 can not be achieved even if one artificially upscales the transport coefficients within pqcd energy - loss calculations  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the physics underlying the heavy quark observables is not only a matter of a global evaluation of the interaction strength , but there is an opportunity for a more detailed understanding of the microscopic nature of the interaction ( most likely of non - perturbative origin ) and of the hadronization mechanism , as we briefly review in the following .    a hint on non - perturbative interactions of heavy quarks in the medium is provided by lqcd computations which exhibit resonance structures in meson correlation functions at moderate temperatures  @xcite .",
    "along this line two of us have suggested that @xmath14- and @xmath15-resonance exchange in the @xmath53 channel may be the dominant scattering process that drives the hq dynamics  @xcite . to evaluate the consequences of such a picture",
    "we have built a model based on an effective lagrangian : @xmath54 where @xmath55=@xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we have calculated elastic @xmath56 scattering amplitudes via @xmath55 exchange in the @xmath57- and @xmath58-channel .",
    "the existence of one @xmath55 state ( e.g. , a pseudoscalar @xmath59=@xmath60 ) , is assumed together with a minimal degeneracy following from chiral and hq symmetries , represented by dirac matrices @xmath61=1 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .    the application to hics",
    "is realized by treating hq kinetics in the qgp as a relativistic langevin process  @xcite : @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 are drag and ( momentum ) diffusion coefficients which determine the approach to equilibrium and satisfy the einstein relation , @xmath68 .",
    "the bulk medium is modeled by a spatially homogeneous elliptic thermal fireball which expands isentropically .",
    "finally , hadronization is treated via coalescence at @xmath13=180  mev , see eq .",
    "( [ coal1 ] ) , plus fragmentation processes evaluated as @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 is the probability for a heavy quark to coalesce .    for 200",
    "agev au+au collisions results from the langevin simulation including hadronization by coalescence+fragmentation ( left ) and fragmentation only ( right ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ raa ] together with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that elastic scattering in a pqcd scheme is insufficient to account for the small @xmath12 , independent of the hadronization scheme applied .",
    "the red band shows the full calculation with @xmath71 quarks that scatter in the presence of hadron - like resonances with a width @xmath72-@xmath73  gev ( representing the interaction strength ) , supplemented by the pqcd elastic scattering in color non - singlet channels ( dominated by gluons ) .",
    "we note that the contamination of single electrons from @xmath15 decays is significant already at @xmath74 gev ( corresponding to a crossing of @xmath10 and @xmath11 spectra at around @xmath8@xmath754 - 5  gev ) .",
    "thus the inclusion of @xmath15 mesons ( despite the inherent uncertainties in the @xmath11/@xmath10 ratio ) is mandatory to draw reliable conclusions on the interaction processes underlying the experimental results .",
    "when comparing the band in the left and right panel of fig .  [ raa ] we can see a clear coalescence effect of hadronization in terms of an increase in the @xmath12 at @xmath76-@xmath77 gev .",
    "this effect becomes more significant via a simultaneous enhancement of the elliptic flow @xmath2 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ figv2 ] this behavior is typical of a coalescence mechanism , reversing the usual correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath2 , and allows for a reasonable description of the experimental data on both @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "very recently , a brueckner many - body scheme for in - medium t - matrices for hq scattering off light quarks @xcite has been evaluated starting from lqcd potentials .",
    "the existence of @xmath14 and @xmath15-like resonances has been confirmed ; furthermore , when embedding the pertinent drag and diffusion coefficients in the model described above , a comparable ( or even better ) agreement with the data is found  @xcite .",
    "the first stage of rhic program has shown clear signs of modifications of the hadronization mechanism in the light - quark sector relative to @xmath23 collisions .",
    "there are several evidences that hadronization proceeds through the coalescence of ( massive ) anti-/quarks which are close in phase space .",
    "the modification of hadronization for light quarks also seems to play a role in the new challenge posed by heavy - quark probes . here",
    ", the main issue is the dominant interaction mechanism ( hq diffusion ) and its relation to the microscopic structure of the qgp .",
    "we have presented a scenario based on the existence of @xmath15- and @xmath14-like resonances in the qgp up to @xmath78 .",
    "reasonable agreement with experimental data is achieved owing to a positive interplay between the resonance scattering mechanism and the hadronization by coalescence .",
    "we note that such an approach provides an inherent consistency between the in - medium interactions of hqs and the subsequent hadronization by coalescence : a pole in the quark - antiquark propagator above @xmath13 can be viewed as a precursor of recombination .    finally , it is important to keep in mind the interrelations of open and hidden charm , if regeneration makes up a good fraction of the charmonium yield as expected at rhic and lhc . in this case",
    ", the study of @xmath15 and @xmath14 distributions can be related to that of @xmath79 and @xmath80 due to the underlying common @xmath10 , @xmath11 distributions ; the consistency of such a picture should be checked in the near future ."
