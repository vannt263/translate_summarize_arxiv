    "evaporation of water is an important phase transformation appearing in many guises throughout everyday life .",
    "its effects range from processes intrinsically linked to the earth s hydrologic cycle , to the regulation of body temperature in hot environments , to the production of coffee  ring stains beneath a spilt coffee droplet and to important processes underlying microfluidics .",
    "while the evaporation of bulk pure materials provides a wide variety of thin film instabilities @xcite , the simple act of introducing solutes , with their myriad of interfacial effects , leads to a spate of new behaviors whose exploration is in its infancy .",
    "examples include the investigation of coffee  ring formation by a sessile , particle  laden droplet @xcite , the observation of finite contact angles in evaporating , wetting films @xcite , and of particular interest here , the observations of du & stone on evaporatively grown salt trees @xcite . understanding the underlying mechanisms that control the patterns that emerge during evaporation and solidification of solutions influences a wide range of fields , from the interpretation of _ evaporite deposits _ for clues about environmental conditions in the geologic past @xcite , to the _ scaling _ deposits in tea kettles when used with hard water @xcite .",
    "du & stone @xcite observed the evolution of ramified crystal structures during the evaporation of water from an ammonium chloride solution under varying ( but not quantitatively controlled ) external conditions .",
    "initially these crystals were confined within the bulk liquid , but eventually they protruded above the liquid surface , forming _ salt trees _ , the growth in this latter stage being caused by evaporation of a film maintained at the surface of the solid salt by capillarity . in consequence du & stone @xcite postulated the existence of two distinct instabilities giving rise to two different characteristic lengthscales of the system ( figure  [ amchlo ] ) .",
    "although their observations did not quantify the conditions for onset of either instability they were led to make the following general distinctions . the smaller scale instability ( with a characteristic length scale estimated to be @xmath0 10@xmath1 m )",
    "was suggested to arise from evaporatively driven supersaturation that allows fluctuations of the salt ",
    "liquid interface to grow in a manner qualitatively similar to the growth of a solid into a supercooled melt .",
    "the second instability ( with a characteristic length scale estimated to be @xmath0 100@xmath1 m ) was proposed as being due to a spatial variation in evaporative flux across the surface ; the film at the surface of a crystal protruding further into the dry atmosphere will cause faster evaporation of the film and hence further growth relative to adjacent regions .    [ [ !",
    "h ] [ amchlo ]     while these rough estimates neither constrain the nature of either instability , nor quantify the thermodynamic ranges of their existence , the du & stone @xcite observations motivate a simple theoretical analysis that we hope will focus the future experimental search . indeed , more sophisticated treatments are not warranted by the present experimental evidence . hence , in this paper we focus on the first of these instabilities and demonstrate the existence of an observable length - scale during the evaporative growth of salt crystals .",
    "we study the mechanism of the first , salt - diffusion - driven , instability and simplify the system as follows .",
    "firstly , although latent heat is produced at two phase boundaries , because the diffusivity of heat in the liquid phase @xmath2 is much greater than the diffusivity of salt @xmath3 , we are justified in treating the system as isothermal .",
    "secondly , the vapor pressure of salt in air is exceedingly small relative to that of water vapor and hence there is no salt transport in the air .",
    "additionally , apart from the consequences of the instability we discuss , there are no liquid inclusions in the salt phase .",
    "thirdly , we treat the system as planar with shallow perturbations to the two interfaces .",
    "this allows us to use the typical approximations to the curvature and normal derivatives that we check _",
    "post  hoc_. finally , we assume that the liquid  vapor interface is maintained flat by flow in the liquid phase due to the influence of surface tension . from lubrication theory",
    ", we find that the time scale for the relaxation of a film of thickness @xmath4 to a planar state is given by @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the dynamic viscosity of water , @xmath6 is the wavenumber of the perturbation , and @xmath7 is the surface tension of the liquid  air interface . the diffusive time scale for the system is given by @xmath8 where @xmath3 is the diffusivity of salt in the liquid .",
    "thus the hydrodynamic relaxation to a planar interface will occur on a much shorter timescale than that on which instability occurs as long as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the maximum growth rate of the instability as given later . hence , because @xmath11 m ( as we show later ) , we can ignore the motion of the liquid ",
    "vapor interface when @xmath12 m .",
    "this is a good assumption in the relevant parameter space .",
    "we will also show that the advection of solute in the film is negligible relative to diffusive transport , and so the precise details of the flow can be ignored .",
    "these are either common approximations that are borne out experimentally or are confirmed to hold within the regimes of validity of the theory .",
    "finally , although we have analysed the effect of marangoni stresses in transporting liquid to the edges of evaporating droplets @xcite previously , the salt concentration at the liquid ",
    "vapor interface was taken as fixed , giving rise to large salinity differences across the liquid film . here",
    ", we relax this assumption and consider instead the evaporatively controlled salinity at the liquid  vapor interface . motivated by the observations of du & stone @xcite , we shall treat the ammonium chloride ",
    "water system at room temperature and typical humidities throughout this paper .",
    "however , we note that the analysis is applicable to many other systems of the same general class .    consider a planar salt crystal covered by a film of salt solution that has an initial thickness @xmath4 as shown in figure ( [ wett ] ) .",
    "we expose the film to an undersaturated vapor which drives evaporation at the liquid  vapor interface .",
    "in general , within the film the solute density then satisfies the advection ",
    "diffusion equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of solute in the liquid , @xmath15 is the velocity of the liquid and @xmath16 are horizontal , vertical and time coordinates .     and",
    "@xmath17 are the densities of salt in the solution at the salt  liquid interface and the liquid ",
    "vapour interface respectively , @xmath18 is the evaporation rate of the film , and @xmath19 is the growth rate of the salt crystal .",
    "initially the interfacial positions are given by @xmath20 for the salt ",
    "liquid interface and @xmath21 for the liquid  vapour interface.,height=302 ]    two - phase , two - component equilibrium at the two phase boundaries , requires the satisfaction of two boundary conditions for the system .",
    "firstly , the liquidus relationship , which defines bulk equilibrium between the salt in the film and that in the underlying planar crystal , is modified for the shift in equilibrium associated with the curvature of the solid  liquid interface @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the melting temperature of a pure liquid salt , @xmath25 is the slope of the liquidus , @xmath26 is the surface energy of the salt ",
    "liquid interface and @xmath27 is the heat of solution of the salt .",
    "this describes equilibrium as a linear combination of the colligative and gibbs - thomson effects .",
    "we note that we have assumed that the curvature term is independent of solute density , so the resulting expression will not be exact .",
    "rearranging , we obtain @xmath28 which gives us the equilibrium boundary condition at the salt  liquid interface : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the vertical position of the solid  liquid interface relative to the position of the planar growth interface position as derived below , @xmath31 is the equilibrium value of the solute density at a planar interface , and @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , the dynamically maintained planarity of the liquid ",
    "vapor interface allows us to treat the evaporation rate there as a constant .",
    "although the evaporation rate may be influenced by gradients in salinity along the surface , these are shown below to be small because @xmath33 .",
    "thus we take @xmath34    the two boundary conditions needed to close the system of equations express conservation of salt across the solid  liquid interface , @xmath35 and conservation of water across the liquid  vapor interface , @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the density of salt in the solid phase and @xmath19 is the planar growth rate of the solid  liquid interface before the introduction of any perturbation .",
    "the natural length , velocity and time scales imposed on the system are given by @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath38 respectively and so we scale variables accordingly so that @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . thus , equation ( [ diffadv ] ) becomes @xmath42 where the peclet number pe is defined as @xmath43 and corresponds to the relative importance of advective ( due to evaporation of the interface ) and diffusive transport processes . for a typical aqueous ammonium chloride solution at @xmath44c , @xmath45m@xmath46 and @xmath47 so that pe@xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the peclet number will be small for all films under consideration and we can approximate equation ( [ diffadv ] ) by laplace s equation @xmath49 hence , during planar growth of the salt crystal information is diffused sufficiently rapidly across the film that the solutal profile is linear and given by @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the solute density at the liquid  vapor interface in this basic state , determined from the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) upon application",
    "of which we find @xmath52 and @xmath53 we note that this last equation agrees with our intuition expressing as it does the fact that as water is evaporated at the surface , the amount of salt that was dissolved in the evaporated water is instantaneously deposited onto the salt crystal at the base of the film . also , from equation [ a ] the gradient in salt density across the film is given by @xmath54 the last approximation also stems from the fact that the peclet number is small .",
    "this shows that the salt density gradient across the film is roughly independent of film thickness , and thus any perturbation at the salt  liquid interface will encounter similar salt field conditions independent of film thickness .",
    "thus , in this limit , it can be anticipated that the growth rate of the perturbation will not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "we are now in a position to conduct a linear stability analysis of this quasi  stationary planar state , noting first that for this quasi  stationary linear stability analysis to be relevant , the perturbation must grow much faster than the rate of change of the underlying base state , so we must check _ a posteriori _ that the growth rate of the most unstable wavelength satisfies @xmath55 . from consideration of the basic state , we choose to nondimensionalise the solute density by setting @xmath56 .",
    "the governing equations ( [ diffadv],[bc3],[bc1],[bc2 ] ) then become @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the nondimensional solutal gibbs  thomson coefficient , and we recall that the interface position @xmath62 .",
    "we now impose a small perturbation upon the interface so that @xmath63    the perturbation to the solutal field that satisfies laplace s equation is given by @xmath64 and after applying boundary conditions ( [ 1]-[3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 from which we obtain the dispersion relation governing the instability : @xmath68 this relation provides the most unstable wavenumber or cutoff wavelength as @xmath69 which for a film thickness of @xmath70 m takes a value of @xmath71 . due to the fact that this is much greater than 1 , we suggest that a reasonable approximation to the dispersion relation is to take the limit for large @xmath6 , in which case it reduces to the same form as that of the mullins  sekerka instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , namely , @xmath72 figure ( [ wett1 ] ) shows a plot of the dispersion relation for @xmath70 m and also the asymptotic approximation given by the equation above .",
    "it can be seen that the asymptotic approximation gives excellent agreement with the full expression .",
    "indeed for film thicknesses greater than a micron , the asymptotic expression can be substituted for the full expression without appreciable loss of accuracy .",
    "m. insert shows the behaviour close to the origin .",
    "continuous line gives full dispersion , dashed line shows large @xmath6 asymptotic relation.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ] [ wett1 ]    .table of typical values for the ammonium chloride / water system [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     from equation ( [ asymp ] ) , the most unstable wavenumber is given by @xmath73 and thus we find the growth rate of the instability , @xmath74 to be @xmath75 thus for a typical film of thickness @xmath70 m , the wavelength of the instability will be @xmath76 m with a growth rate of around 16 times the speed of growth of the crystal .",
    "the most unstable wavenumber corresponds to a wavelength @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the capillary length corresponding the supersaturation across the film .",
    "this expresses the rule of thumb that the length scale characteristic of morphological instabilities is the geometric mean of the diffusion length and the capillary length ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also informative to note the dependence of @xmath79 and @xmath80 upon @xmath4 .    in the small peclet number limit ,",
    "equation ( [ a ] ) becomes @xmath81 so that the most unstable wavenumber is ( dimensionally ) @xmath82 and the dimensional growth rate of the instability is @xmath83 therefore , as was suggested by the fact that the salt gradient in the film is independent of film thickness , _ both _ of these results are _ independent _ of @xmath4 and their sole dependence on the diffusive driving force , the evaporation rate @xmath18 , is simply exhibited .",
    "although du and stone @xcite did not measure the evaporation rate , here we estimate a value of @xmath84 , from the typical room temperature situation in which they made their observations , and hence we find a wavelength of @xmath85 m .",
    "we have illustrated the existence of a new instability in the evaporation of impure ( salty ) films .",
    "supersaturation of the film caused by evaporation at the liquid ",
    "vapor interface leads to enhanced growth of perturbations to the salt ",
    "liquid interface underlying the film .",
    "the instability is similar to instabilities arising during the solidification of a binary alloy into a melt @xcite , however the chief difference is that supersaturation is created at some distance from the advancing salt front , whereas with the classical morphological instability of directionally solidified alloys , the supersaturation is caused by rejection of solvent immediately adjacent to the salt front . as suggested by du and stone @xcite based on qualitative observations ,",
    "this is a likely mechanism for the growth of the microscopic perturbations to the surface of growing ammonium chloride trees .",
    "the analysis is appropriate for small peclet number which , given typical expected room temperature evaporation rates , requires films less than o(1 mm ) in initial thickness .",
    "it should also be noted that solutal convection would be expected to set in for films on the order of 1 mm in thickness .",
    "however we expect films present in ammonium chloride trees to be sufficiently thin to avoid these complications .",
    "although du and stone @xcite observed structures on the order of @xmath86 m , our analysis is principally intended to point out the nature of this evaporative instability and the experimental parameters of note , namely , @xmath87 and @xmath18 .",
    "the wide variability in the observed scales across the surface of the film is likely to be due to gradients in evaporation rate at the interface due to local conditions and/or an underlying nonlinear bifurcation ( common in diffusive type solidification problems ) but the present state of the experimental evidence does not warrant a more thorough theoretical treatment .",
    "thus , while this mechanism provides the likely cause of the growth of microscopic perturbations as observed by du and stone @xcite , it clearly coexists with the other phenomena that they have pointed out and we have discussed further here .",
    "it is hoped that by focusing on a well defined situation , this analysis will provide a framework for refined experimental searches .",
