    "neutrino mass related questions are of great interest for particle physics as well as for cosmology ( for reviews see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "current upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological observations are of the order of 1 ev @xcite , while neutrino oscillations give a lower bound of roughly 0.01 ev @xcite , making neutrino mass an established element of particle physics .",
    "furthermore , understanding the origin of neutrino mass opens a window into understanding physical processes beyond the standard model of particle physics @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that about seventy four percent of the universe is comprised of dark energy ( de ) ( for reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite and citation therein ) .",
    "the present stage of evolution of the universe is governed by this dominant de contribution , and the universe experiences an accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "the nature of de is still unknown , and it is one of the major questions of modern cosmology .",
    "there are , broadly speaking , three major possibilities proposed to explain the de @xcite .",
    "most straightforwardly , and in good agreement with the current observational data , it can be present just as the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "secondly , the de can be accommodated in some framework of the modified non - einsteinian gravity theories ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "and lastly , following the original proposals @xcite on the de originating from a scalar field action similar to the inflaton field , there has been a lot of activity in constructing and analyzing various trial scalar field lagrangians to model the de @xcite .",
    "note , that it is even unclear what kind of scalar field potential governs the inflationary expansion of the universe @xcite , and as the result , the effective quantum field that adequately describes inflation is still under debate @xcite . a similar observation can be drawn from analyzing many potentials proposed for the de action @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , several cosmological and astrophysical observations imply that about twenty two percent of the universe consists of dark matter ( dm ) @xcite , if we admit the general relativity theory of gravity .",
    "most probably dm is formed through massive weakly interacting particles ( wimps ) , and the nature of these particles is also still unknown .",
    "there are several recent observations performed by pamela @xcite and glast missions which indicate dm particle annihilations @xcite .",
    "recently it was proposed that both these observations could be used to test baryogenesis @xcite which is one of the important problems of the standard particle physics model .",
    "another puzzling question in modern cosmology is the coincidence problem - the density of de is comparable to the present energy density of dm . in turn , the latter is comparable ( within the order of magnitude ) , to the energy density of cosmological neutrinos @xcite ) .",
    "is there a mechanism explaining this coincidence ?",
    "a very convincing answer to this question is given by the mechanism of dm mass generation via various types of dm - de couplings , ranging from yukawa to more exotic ones .",
    "@xcite the mass of the dm particle in this approach is naturally time - dependent , and they were coined varying mass particles ( vamps ) .",
    "various de ",
    "dm interaction models have been constrained by observations of supernovae type ia @xcite , the age of the universe @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite , and large scale structure ( lss ) formation @xcite .",
    "fardon , nelson and weiner elaborated on the vamp mechanism in the context of neutrinos .",
    "@xcite . in their model",
    "the relic neutrinos , i.e. , fermionic field(s ) , interact with a scalar field via the yukawa coupling .",
    "if the decoupled neutrino field is initially massless , then the coupling generates a ( varying ) mass of neutrinos in this de - neutrinos model .",
    "this mass varying neutrino ( mavan ) scenario is quite compelling , since it connects the origin of neutrino mass to the de , and solves the additional coincidence problem of why the neutrino mass and de are of comparable scales @xcite .",
    "( for more on the coincidence , see , e.g. @xcite ) . to consider neutrinos as particles which get their mass through the coupling is attractive for particle physics , as well as for its cosmological consequences",
    ". however there are significant issues that have to be resolved for the sake of viability of the mavan scenario .",
    "most notably , it has been shown @xcite that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite suffers from a strong instability due to the negative sound speed squared of the de - neutrino fluid ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "any dm - de coupling induces observable changes in large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is due to the presence of additional dm contributions ( perturbations ) in the equation of motion which determines the dynamics of the scalar field .",
    "the changes in the dynamics are drastic when massive neutrinos are coupled to de @xcite . in this case the squared sound speed of the de - neutrino fluid defined as @xmath4 , ( where @xmath5 represents the variation , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are pressure and energy density of the de - neutrino fluid ) is negative .",
    "the negative squared sound speed results in an exponential growth of scalar perturbations .",
    "@xcite    after the critique in ref .",
    "@xcite , the issue of stability of the de - neutrinos fluid has been addressed by many authors @xcite .",
    "various physical assumptions were made in those references in order to avoid the exponential clustering of neutrinos .",
    "in particular , to achieve stability , proposals were put forward to make the de - dm model more complicated , e.g. , by extending it to a multi - component scalar field , or by promoting its supersymmetry .",
    "@xcite we however are not inclined to pursue this line of thought and will explore the simplest possible `` minimal '' model . as we will demonstrate , the occurrence of the instability in the coupled de - neutrinos model is meaningful , and we will explore the physical implications of this phenomenon .",
    "note that wetterich and co - workers @xcite have already analyzed various implications of the instability in the mavan model on the dynamics of neutrino clustering .",
    "in this paper we re - address the analysis of the de - neutrinos coupled model .",
    "what is really new in our results , to the best of our knowledge , apart from a consistent equation for the equilibrium condition , is the analysis of the thermal ( i.e. temporal ) evolution of the mavan model and prediction of its stable , metastable and unstable phases .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics in the unstable phase results in , for the first time in the framework of the mavan scenario , a picture of the present - time universe totally consistent with observations .",
    "our findings are in line with the original proposal @xcite of the de potential ( quintessence ) to model the universe slowly rolling towards its true vacuum ( @xmath8 ) . as it turns out , the present universe , seen as a system of the coupled de ( quintessence ) field and fermions ( neutrinos ) is below its critical temperature .",
    "it is similar to a supercooled liquid which has not crystallized yet : its high temperature ( meta)stable phase became unstable , but the new low - temperature stable phase ( @xmath8 ) is still to be reached .",
    "the afshordi - zaldarriaga - kohri instability corresponding to @xmath9 is just telling us this .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ m&f ] we give the outlook of the model and formalism applied and derive the basic equations for the coupled model . in section  [ maseq ]",
    "we present the qualitative analysis of the equation which yields the fermionic ( neutrino ) mass .",
    "section  [ prpot ] contains analysis of the coupled model with the ratra - peebles de potential at equilibrium .",
    "the dynamics of the model applied to the whole universe is studied in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "the results are summarized in the concluding section  [ concl ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on the case when the scalar field potential @xmath10 does not have a non - trivial minimum , and the generation of the fermion mass is due to the breaking of chiral symmetry in the dirac sector of the lagrangian .",
    "a non - trivial solution of the fermionic mass equation is a result of the interplay between the scalar and fermionic contributions .",
    "we consider the most natural and intuitively plausible yukawa coupling between the dirac and the scalar fields .",
    "the key assumption is that the fermionic mass generation can be obtained from minimization of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "that is , the coupled system of the scalar bosonic and fermionic fields is at equilibrium , at least at some temperatures .",
    "this will be analyzed below more specifically .",
    "we assume the cosmological evolution , governed by the scale factor @xmath11 to be slow enough that the coupled system is at equilibrium at a given temperature @xmath12",
    ". then the methods of thermal quantum field theory @xcite can be applied .",
    "this problem is rather well studied with quantum field theory and statistical physics in different contexts @xcite .",
    "the major conceptual difficulty in applying quantum field - theoretical methods for the dark - energy scalar field is the lack of  well - behaved \" potentials interesting for cosmological applications .",
    "for instance , a class of the very popular inverse power law slow - rolling quintessence potentials @xcite are singular at the origin .",
    "consequently , the field theory should be understood as a sort of effective theory , and we plan to address this issue more deeply in our future work .    as far as the fermionic sector of the theory is concerned , one needs to distinguish two different cases pertinent for neutrino applications : +",
    "( i ) an equal number of fermions and antifermions , i.e. , zero chemical potential @xmath13 ; + ( ii ) a surplus of particles over antiparticles , and small non - zero chemical potential .    for the bounds on the neutrino chemical potential , see refs . @xcite .",
    "if experiments confirm neutrinoless double beta decay , i.e. , that neutrinos are majorana fermions , then the lepton number is not conserved @xcite , and one can not introduce a ( non - zero ) chemical potential . then case ( i ) above is applicable , proviso that the majorana fields are utilized instead of the dirac ones . for the case ( i ) with dirac fermions the ground state corresponds to a complete annihilation of fermion - antifermion pairs , i.e. the fermions completely vanish in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "assumption of the fermion - antifermion asymmetry and ( conserving ) particle surplus , i.e. , of a non - zero chemical potential , results in the fermionic contributions which survive the zero - temperature limit .",
    "however the smallness of the zero - temperature contribution renders this issue rather academic .",
    "indeed , for the neutrinos we are interested in this study , by assuming the _ maximal _ particle surplus @xmath14 , one gets the fermi momentum @xmath15ev . for @xmath16ev ,",
    "one obtains @xmath17 .",
    "this results in a non - trivial vacuum with the particle surplus frozen within an extremely narrow fermi shell @xmath18 .",
    "thus , trying to grasp the essential physics in this study from possibly the simplest  minimal model \" , we assume the fermions to be described by a dirac spinor field with zero chemical potential .    in this work we will use the standard methods of general relativity and finite - temperature quantum field theory extended for fields living in a spatially flat universe with the friedmann - lematre - robertson  walker ( flrw ) metric where the line element is @xmath19 . here",

    ", as e.g. @xmath187 taken for the plots , are virtually indistinguishable for the cases of the ratra - peebles ( [ rp ] ) or logarithmic ( [ logu ] ) potentials .",
    "however the ratra - peebles potential at more `` natural '' @xmath190 allows to probe the coupled fermionic - quintessence models in the search of heavy dm particle candidates . ]",
    "in this paper we analyzed the mavan scenario in a framework of a simple `` minimal '' model with only one species of the ( initially ) massless dirac fermions coupled to the scalar quintessence field . by using the methods of thermal quantum field theory we derived for the first time ( in the context of the mavan or , even more broadly , the vamp models ) a consistent equation for fermionic mass generation in the coupled model .",
    "we demonstrated that the mass equation has non - trivial solutions only for special classes of potentials and only within certain temperature intervals .",
    "it appears that these results have not been reported in the literature on vamps before now .",
    "we gave most of the results for the particular choice of a trial de potential ",
    "the ratra - peebles quintessence potential .",
    "this potential has all the necessary properties we needed for our task : it is simple , it satisfies the criteria we found for non - trivial solutions of the mass equation to exist , and it has only one dimensionfull parameter- the energy scale @xmath1 to tune .",
    "also , at small values of the exponent @xmath143 it effectively crosses over to the case of a logarithmic potential .",
    "we have checked that other potentials , e.g. , exponential , lead to a qualitatively similar picture , but they have at least one more energy scale to handle , which we consider as an unnecessary complication at this point .",
    "we analyzed the thermal ( i.e. temporal ) evolution of the model , following the time arrow .",
    "contrary to what one might expect from analogies with other contexts , like , e.g. , condensed matter , the model does not generate the mass via a conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking below a certain temperature .",
    "instead it has a non - trivial solution for the fermionic mass evolving `` smoothly '' from zero at the `` point '' @xmath191 .",
    "the scalar field is infinitely heavy at the same point .",
    "more realistically , we assumed the model is applicable starting at the temperatures somewhere in the beginning of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "we found that the de contribution in this regime is subleading , and the model behaves as an ultra - relativistic fermi gas at those temperatures .",
    "this regime corresponds to a stable phase of the model given by a global minimum of the thermodynamic potential @xmath192 .",
    "the temperature / time dependent minimum @xmath193 generates the varying fermionic mass @xmath194 .",
    "with increase in time , as the temperature decreases , the model reaches the point of metastability where its pressure ( @xmath6 ) vanishes . from our estimates of the model",
    "s scales , we showed that this happens during the matter - dominated era of the universe . at this point",
    "the system s ground state becomes doubly degenerate , and the potential @xmath158 at the non - trivial ( finite ) minimum @xmath193 as well as at the trivial vacuum @xmath195 .",
    "further on , at lower temperatures the system stays in the metastable ( supercooled ) state until it reaches the critical point where the local minimum of the thermodynamic potential disappears and it becomes an inflexion point . at this critical temperature",
    "the model undergoes a first - order ( discontinuous ) phase transition . at the critical point _",
    "the equilibrium values _ of the fermionic and the scalar field masses discontinuously jump to the ` doomsday' vacuum state values @xmath149 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "the square of the sound velocity and equation of state parameter @xmath197 have _ the equilibrium values _ corresponding to the de sitter universe with a cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath198 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath199 in both the stable and metastable phases , and the sound velocity vanishes reaching the critical temperature from above .    since the equilibrium approach is not applicable below the critical temperature , we find parameters of the model from direct numerical solution of the equation of motion and the friedmann equations .",
    "the single scale @xmath1 of the quintessence potential is chosen to match the present de density , then other parameters of the universe are determined .",
    "we obtain a consistent picture : the phase transition has occurred rather recently at @xmath200 during the matter - dominated era , and the universe is now being driven towards the stable vacuum with zero @xmath0-term .",
    "the expansion of the universe accelerates starting from @xmath201 . setting @xmath187 for @xmath202",
    ", we end up with the neutrino mass @xmath203 .",
    "the present results allow us to propose a completely new viewpoint not only on the mavan , but on the quintessence scenario for the universe as well .",
    "the common concerns about the slow - rolling mechanism for the de relaxation toward the @xmath8 vacuum are related to the question of what is the mechanism to set the initial value of the scalar field @xmath204 where it evolves ( rolls down ) from .",
    "our results demonstrate that up to recent times ( i.e. above the critical temperature ) the quintessence field was locked around its average ( classical ) value @xmath193 .",
    "its value is determined by the scale @xmath1 and the temperature .",
    "the average @xmath193 gives the fermionic mass at the same time .",
    "the scalar field is rigid ( i.e. massive ) , although it softens ( i.e. , its mass decreases ) as the system approaches the critical temperature . above the critical temperature the scalar field can only oscillate around its equilibrium value @xmath205 . at the critical point",
    "the minimum of the thermodynamic potential becomes the inflexion point , the scalar field looses its rigidity ( mass ) .",
    "then the field can only roll down towards the new stable ground state @xmath158 at @xmath206 .",
    "so physically , the critical point corresponds to the transition of the universe from the stable oscillatory to the unstable rolling regime .",
    "a more sophisticated numerical study of the kinetics after the critical point is warranted in order to address such issues as the detailed description of the crossover between different regimes , and the clustering of neutrinos .",
