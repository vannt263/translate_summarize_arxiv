    "during the last years , the field of ultracold few - body confined systems has progressed remarkably . by employing optical dipole traps @xcite and atom chips @xcite it is possible to fabricate mesoscopic structures in which the atoms are freezed to occupy a single or a few lowest quantum states of a confining potential such that in one or more dimensions the characteristic length possesses the order of the atomic debroglie wavelength .",
    "these configurations can be well described by effective one - dimensional systems .",
    "well - known examples are quantum wires and atom waveguides or quasi two - dimensional systems such as 2d electronic gases .",
    "the quantum dynamics of such systems is strongly influenced by the geometry of the confinement .    to control the coherent propagation of particle beams through 1d or 2d traps it is crucial to very well understand the impact of the confinement on the collisional properties ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and refs.therein ) .",
    "free - space scattering theory is no longer valid in such systems and a new theory is needed .",
    "this stimulated the development of quantum scattering theory in low dimensions .",
    "for a sufficiently dilute gas under a strong transverse confinement , one may expect both the chemical potential and the thermal energy @xmath1 being less than the transverse level spacing . with this assumption",
    ", the dynamics of ultracold atoms in low dimensional structures e.g. tight wave guides has been studied using the simplification that the atoms occupy only the ground state of the transverse confining potential . nevertheless , the virtual transverse excitations in the course of the collision process can play a crucial role in the scattering leading to the so - called confinement - induced resonances ( cirs ) , predicted by olshanii @xcite .",
    "s - wave zero - energy scattering of bosons is mapped to an effective longitudinal zero - range pseudopotential @xmath2 approximating the 1d atom - atom interaction in a transverse harmonic confinement .",
    "it was shown@xcite that cirs appear if the binding energy of the pseudopotential , approximating the two - atom molecular state in the presence of the confinement , coincides with the energy spacing between the levels of the transverse harmonic potential . in the vicinity of the cir",
    "the coupling constant @xmath3 can be tuned from @xmath4 to @xmath5 by varying the strength of the confining potential over a small range .",
    "this can result in a total atom - atom reflection , thereby creating a gas of impenetrable bosons .",
    "cirs have also been studied for the three - body @xcite and the four - body @xcite scattering under confining potential , as well as for a pure p - wave scattering of fermions @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for the cirs for bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite has recently been reported .",
    "a general analytical treatment of low - energy scattering under action of a general cylindrical confinement involving all partial waves and their coupling , was first provided in ref.@xcite for a spherically symmetric short - range potential .",
    "the effect of the c.m .",
    "motion on the s - wave collision of two distinguishable atoms ( i.e. a two - species mixture ) in a harmonic confinement as well as for two identical atoms in a non - parabolic confining potential has been investigated in ref.@xcite in the zero - energy limit neglecting the s and p wave mixing .",
    "a detailed study including the effect of the c.m . nonseparability and taking into account the s and p wave mixing for harmonic confinement was performed in the single - mode regime in ref .",
    "recently a so - called dual - cir was discovered @xcite , which is characterized by a complete transmission ( suppression of quantum scattering ) in the waveguide due to destructive interference of s and p waves although the corresponding collisions in free space involve strong interactions .",
    "the problem of atomic pair collisions under the action of a harmonic trap in the multi - mode regime when the energy of the atoms exceeds the level spacing of the transverse trapping potential is much more intricate than the single - mode regime due to several open transverse channels .",
    "it demands the development of a multi - channel scattering theory accounting for the possible transitions between the levels of the confining potential . using as a starting point the formalism for scattering in restricted geometries suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , the multi - channel scattering problem for bosons in a harmonic confining potential has been analyzed analytically by olshanii el al .",
    "@xcite in the s - wave pseudopotential approximation and the zero - energy limit . without detailization of the interatomic interaction but",
    "using only two input parameters - the s - wave two - body scattering length in free space and the trap frequency - they have derived an approximate formula for the scattering amplitude describing two boson collisions confined by transverse harmonic trap in the multi - mode regime .    in the present work",
    "we develop a general grid method for multi - channel scattering of identical as well as distinguishable atoms confined by a transverse harmonic trap .",
    "the method applies to arbitrary atomic interactions , permitting a rich spectral structure where several different partial waves are participating in the scattering process or even the case of an anisotropy of the interaction .",
    "the only limitation is that we consider harmonic traps with a single frequency for every atom causing a separation of the c.m . and relative motion . with our approach",
    "we analyze transverse excitations / deexcitations in the course of the collisional process ( distinguishable or identical atoms ) including all important partial waves and their couplings due to the broken spherical symmetry .",
    "special attention is paid to the analysis of the cirs in the multi - mode regimes for non - zero collision energies , i.e. , to suggest a non - trivial extension of the cirs theory developed so far only for the single - mode regime and zero - energy limit .    in detail",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "section ii contains the derivation of the hamiltonian , definitions of the interatomic interaction and the scattering asymptotics in the confined geometry , and a discussion of the scattering parameters and the transition probabilities characterizing the two - body collisions in the trap .",
    "our computational method is outlined in sec .",
    "iii , important technical details are given in the appendix .",

    "also fermionic as well as mixed collisions in a trap and including the case of higher energies .",
    "this will , as we shall see below , permit us to investigate new regimes and effects of multi - channel confined scattering .",

    "the radial and azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath50 and @xmath46 of the 2d harmonic oscillator independently take the values @xmath51 . due to the axial symmetry of the transverse confinement and the spherical symmetry of the interatomic interaction ( [ potential ] )",
    "the angular momentum component along the @xmath47-axis is conserved .",
    "therefore , the problem ( [ rescaled scheroedinger equation ] ) is reducible to a 2d one by separating the @xmath52-variable and can be solved for every @xmath46 independently .",

    "<S> series of feshbach resonances in the transmission behaviour are identified and analyzed . </S>",

    "<S> the dual cir leading to a complete quantum suppression of atomic scattering is revealed in multi - channel scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications include , e.g. , cold and ultracold atom - atom collisions in atomic waveguides and electron - impurity scattering in quantum wires . </S>"
