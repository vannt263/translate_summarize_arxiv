    "the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) represent a long standing , spectroscopic mystery : hundreds of weak absorption features detected in the optical wavelength range remain unidentified ( see herbig 1995 ; snow 1995 , 2001 for summaries ) . while they were noted in stellar spectra as early as 1919 ( heger 1922 ) , the dibs had their suspected interstellar nature demonstrated more than a decade later ( merrill 1936 ) .",
    "+ most of the early hypotheses regarding the progenitors ( carriers ) of dibs centered on molecules , but by the early 1970s solid - state ( i.e. , grain ) carriers were thought to be more likely ( herbig 1975 ) .",
    "molecules were re - introduced in the mid-1970s ( danks and lambert 1976 ; douglas 1977 ; smith , snow , and york 1977 ) , and now most researchers have adopted large molecules or their ions as the most likely candidates ( see herbig 1995 for a review ) .",

    "( 1998 ) reported a match between the laboratory spectrum of c@xmath7 and five narrow dibs , but with improved laboratory and astronomical data this was subsequently shown to be incorrect ( mccall et al . 2001 ) .",

    "( paper iv ) revisited the @xmath11 correlation .",
    "the unprecedented data quality and statistics of our survey ( see  2 ) show that this pair has the highest correlation of any known pair and the data would be consistent with a perfect correlation if the errors were underestimated by only a modest amount . in the present paper , we extend our investigation to more fully study the eight strong dibs @xmath1 5780.5 , 6204.5 , 6283.8 , 6196.0 , 6613.6 , 5705.1 , 5797.1 , and 5487.7 , in order of decreasing pearson s correlation coefficient with @xmath2(h)(h ) .",
    "this is often mistakenly denoted @xmath12 .",
    "however , h@xmath13i  actually denotes the spectral line of atomic hydrogen . ] .",
    "we also examine the dib - dib correlations as well as the correlation of the dibs with the column density of molecular hydrogen and with color excess . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe how the survey data were obtained and reduced , and we present an extensive list of the line of sight parameters and dib equivalent widths ( ews ) toward the 133 stars reported here . in  3 we present a large variety of correlation coefficients and plots , and the slopes and intercepts of correlation plots between @xmath14 with the other dibs and with @xmath2(h ) , @xmath2(h@xmath4 ) , and @xmath0 . in ",
    "4 we discuss these results , including the importance of systematic errors which arise among measurements of dib equivalent widths . in  5 we summarize the results of this study .",
    "from 1999 to 2002 we obtained a high signal - to - noise data set on dibs in the spectra of about 200 stars spanning a large range of reddening , @xmath0  @xmath15 0.01 to 3.31 magnitudes ( papers i , ii , and iii ) and their associated diatomic or triatomic molecules ( oka et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the reader is referred to those papers for details , and we give only a brief description of the data analysis here . the echelle spectrograph ( wang et al . 2003 ) was used on the apache point observatory 3.5-meter telescope to obtain spectra at a resolving power @xmath3/@xmath16 from 3600  to 9000  at a nominal signal to noise ratio of roughly 1000 at 5780   for each sight line ( see paper i ) .",
    "stellar lines are distinguished from dibs in reddened stars by comparison with stars of the same spectral type but with low reddening .",
    "telluric lines are removed by use of a complex scheme that measures patterns of behavior in key telluric absorption lines and makes a blanket correction for each observation , depending on air mass and humidity .",
    "dibs that were generally uncontaminated by stellar and telluric blends were measured as described extensively in papers i and ii .",
    "dib absorption features pose special challenges for any study , such as this one , seeking to quantify equivalent widths .",
    "ultimately , the goal of dib equivalent width measurements must be to include all blended absorption from the same chemical species without including blended absorption from other chemical species .",
    "however , correctly distinguishing contaminating features from those belonging to the same compound itself presupposes knowledge of those chemical species and their spectra .",
    "as long as the dibs carriers remain unidentified , the shape and width of the spectral profiles will remain uncertain .",
    "the band structure could be due either to blending with features from other carriers or to blending with features from higher rotational levels of the same species , or could be due to both types of blends .    for this study , and for the previous papers in this",
    "series , continuum normalization was accomplished by use of eighth - order legendre polynomials . for the broadest",
    "dibs , absorption spanned multiple spectral orders . in these cases",
    "continuum profiles were estimated by interpolation across multiple orders .",
    "equivalent widths were hand - measured by one of us ( jd ) , along with inspection of each dib in comparison with nearly unreddened standard stars in order to identify stellar lines .",
    "limits of integration were set by where the dib absorption recovered to the continuum . where the profile did not fully recover to the continuum , we set the limits at inflection points in the profile , which often indicate an appropriate endpoint ( krelowski & sneden , 1993 ) .",
    "we made no assumption that the line shapes have gaussian profiles .",
    "equivalent widths were computed with direct integration .",
    "we do not presume that the present choices of integration endpoints are in any way definitive , nor do we suppose that any prior work has made similar choices with any more assurance of correctness or fewer reasonable arguments in favor of their choices .",
    "integration endpoints chosen in the present study reflect a primary interest in _ repeatable _ measurements and minimal sensitivity to continuum location error , both of which are essential to reducing the scatter in correlations from measurement error but do not prevent scatter from other , less easily avoided causes .",
    "we do not recommend that the present equivalent widths be combined from those reported in studies by other investigators without carefully considering the specific definitions of what constitutes the measurement criteria for each diffuse band .",
    "the quantity used to investigate correlations differs from study to study , even among the same investigators .",
    "for example , moutou et al . ( 1999 ) used central depths , stating that they are less sensitive to contamination than are ews , although they point out that depths reflect well the correlation in ew .",
    "weselak et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find in their study that central depths correlate better than ews . on the other hand , in a study at very high spectral resolution ( 220,000 ) of the profiles of @xmath3@xmath36196 , 6614 , galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) found a correlation in the equivalent widths of the dibs but not in the fwhms .",
    "the fwhm of @xmath36196 varies by 50% over the 7 sight lines sampled , whereas for @xmath36614 it is nearly constant within observational errors .",
    "the substructure of both profiles varies among the sight lines but in an unrelated way for the two dibs .",
    "interstellar atomic lines do not reveal doppler broadening , so the authors believe the absorption arises in a single cloud .    until the identification of dibs is secure , by definitive matches with laboratory spectra , no single method can be deemed superior .",
    "we have elected to base our correlation studies on measurements of equivalent widths rather than fwhm or the central depths of profiles .",
    "while the latter two measures are less likely to suffer from contamination by nearby , unrelated species , they will fail to account for broad absorption due to r or p branch transitions , for example .",
    "the strength of these branches depends on the unknown rotation temperature of the molecules along the line of sight , which can vary from cloud to cloud , and even within a cloud . as shown in figure 1 of oka at al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the absorption can occur over a rather large wavelength interval .",
    "another reason to use ews rather than central depth is that most of these sight lines intersect multiple clouds , so our results represent averages over the intervening clouds .",
    "doppler splitting could affect measures of central depth , especially for narrow dibs . as long as there is not saturated component structure",
    ", ews will not suffer from this error .",
    "finally , measures of equivalent widths are independent of the resolution of the instrument used , which is not true of fwhm or central depth .",
    "standard techniques were used for cosmic ray removal , flat fielding , background and bias subtraction , and extraction to one dimensional spectra .",
    "the spectra from adjacent orders were coadded to give a blazeless spectrum .",
    "a set of 35 lines that were most free of stellar blending or telluric line contamination were initially measured .",
    "the estimates of correlations among dibs and between dibs and other interstellar quantities are based on dib measurements presented by paper i for an expanded set of stars , on the h and h@xmath4  column densities of rachford et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2009 ) , and on color excess values collected from the literature by one of us ( lmh ) based on the color scale of johnson ( 1963 ) .",
    "errors on each data point were estimated by measurements in adjacent parts of the continuum , free of other dibs and of stellar or telluric lines , and then were propagated through the analysis .",
    "one sigma errors are used throughout .",
    "mccall et al . ( paper iv ) give an extensive discussion of additional errors that may affect the data .",
    "they suggest that our errors may be underestimated by about a factor of 2 due to systematic effects , the three most likely of which are continuum placement errors , the possible presence of unidentified weak dibs close to the dibs being measured , and the residual errors arising from imperfect removal of telluric water vapor lines . in the present study",
    ", however , we use the formally propagated errors described in paper i.    table 1 includes a list of all 133 stars in this study , their spectral types and luminosity class , @xmath2(h ) , @xmath2(h@xmath4 ) , @xmath0 , and the equivalent widths of the eight dibs we focus on here .",
    "this analysis excludes the 17 lines noted as being correlated with c@xmath4  ( paper i ) and c@xmath17  ( oka et al , 2003 ) , whose relationships with , co , ch , and other molecular species will be the subject of a future study by our group .",
    "rachford et al . (",
    "2009 ) did a reanalysis of @xmath2(h )  and @xmath2(h@xmath4 )  along some of the sight lines included in the current study .",
    "the values that they found of these quantities differ from those derived in the original analysis by less than @xmath18 in all cases , much less than the cosmic dispersion of these quantities .",
    "we therefore use the results of our original , homogeneous data analysis , as presented by rachford et al . (",
    "the dibs chosen for this study were meant to avoid the broadest dibs , for which our echelle measurements can underestimate the line strengths ( hobbs et al .",
    "2009 ) due to continuum placement difficulties .",
    "they were also meant to focus on the classic strong dibs , which do not include the c@xmath4 dibs found by thorburn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( paper i ) .",
    "the strongest dibs with fwhm less than that of @xmath35780.5 are included ( @xmath3@xmath35797.1 , 6613.6 ) .",
    "the dib at @xmath36283.8 is the second strongest dib after @xmath34428.1 , so it was included to test for any evidence of saturation in the range of @xmath0  for our stars , even though it has fwhm = 4.77  ( table 2 ) .",
    "another much weaker dib , @xmath35487.7 , was included as a comparison .",
    "two lines were included because of their previously known correlations with other dibs : @xmath35705.1 ( used in paper i to test for saturation in @xmath35780.5 ) and @xmath36196.0 , previously noted for its close correlation with @xmath36613.6 . an eighth line ( @xmath36204.5 )",
    "was included since it has two narrow components that are blended and it is not clear if they should be measured together or separately .",
    "this characteristic is shared by other dibs , such as @xmath35849.8 and @xmath36660.7 , but we selected @xmath36204.5 because it is among the strongest dibs .",
    "the dibs in paper i were analyzed with respect to their correlation with each other .",
    "the dibs chosen for this paper are at the high end of correlation coefficients and include all the moderately well correlated dibs .",
    "all other dibs from paper i are less well correlated with each other than those in this paper .",
    "spectral profiles of these eight dibs toward hd 183143 and hd 204827 are shown in figure  [ dib8panel ] .",
    "hd 183143 has been observed by many dib investigators ( e.g. , herbig 1975 ; jenniskens & desert 1994 ; tuairisg et al .",
    "2000 ) and is the basis for the atlas discussed in paper iii .",
    "hd 204827 , discussed in paper ii , reveals several narrow , weak dibs which are not evident in hd 183143 , and vice versa .",
    "some broad dibs are not seen in common in the two stars , as well .",
    "we note that the central wavelength for each band in fig .",
    "[ dib8panel ] is slightly longer for hd 183143 than for hd 204827 , a systematic difference anticipated and discussed in some detail in papers ii and iii .",
    "the unavoidable uncertainty in the precise zero - point for dib wavelengths arises primarily from the combination of the multiple interstellar clouds present along both stellar lines of sight and the unknown identities and laboratory spectra of the molecules presumed to cause the dibs .",
    "the median offset for the eight bands in fig .",
    "[ dib8panel ] corresponds to about 7 km / s .",
    "had we arbitrarily chosen to assign the laboratory k@xmath13i  wavelength to the mid - point between the two main components of the interstellar k@xmath13i  line toward hd 183143 ( paper iii , fig .",
    "2 ) , for example , this systematic median offset would effectively be removed .",
    "this result implies that the dibs show component structure .",
    "indeed , doppler splitting in the narrow dib @xmath36196.0 , matching the splitting of interstellar k@xmath13i , about 15 km  s@xmath19 , was observed in high - resolution spectra of hd 183143 by herbig & soderblom ( 1982 ) .",
    "however , in our observations the scatter in the mean is such that some dibs may be dominant in one component and some in others .",
    "the offsets for the narrowest dibs are clear .",
    "we will address this issue in a future paper ( york et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "figure  [ dib8panel ] also illustrates our choice of integration limits for the dibs along these two sight lines , and the ambiguities this involves .",
    "for example , @xmath35780.5 is either at the bottom of a broad feature or else is flanked by a series of narrow , possibly related , features .",
    "not knowing the origin of each feature , we assumed the former interpretation as did , for example , galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for @xmath36204.5",
    "we include the extended red wing .",
    "porceddu , benvenuti , & krelowski ( 1991 ) conclude that @xmath36205 is a separate dib on the basis of a varying central depth ratio of the two features .",
    "they further conclude that these differences are due to differences in the physical parameters within a single interstellar cloud , based on the lack of observed doppler splitting in the narrow @xmath36196.0 dib , at their moderate resolving power ( 30,000 ) and snr ( 200300 ) .",
    "for @xmath35797.1 we include the blue wing , in contrast to galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who believe it is blended with a much broader feature at @xmath35795 .",
    "as shown in  3.2 , we find very good correlations associated with @xmath36204.5 and the lower ones for @xmath35797.1 . determining which features correlate best may prove to be a useful tool for guiding the placement of integration limits .",
    "however , it is impossible to know the correct approach in advance , so we favor systematic repeatability until the true profile can be established by species identification in the laboratory .",
    "also shown in figure  [ dib8panel ] are the dibs identified in atlas papers ii and iii ( black and red tick marks ) , the stellar lines ( black and red arrows ) , and a few additional stellar lines ( green arrows ) observed in the spectra of the lightly reddened comparison stars .",
    "broad dibs , like @xmath36283.8 , may include multiple weak dibs identified in the atlases .",
    "the criteria for selecting the dibs is clearly described in these papers , but no claim is made regarding whether these separate dibs really arise from the same carrier molecule .",
    "thus , including or excluding them are equally justifiable approaches .",
    "note that our choice to include them does not significantly affect our results .",
    "for example , the 3 dibs in the wings of the hd 183143 profile have equivalent widths of 28 , 22 , and 19 m  ( paper iii ) which , even in total comprise only a few percent of the 1910 m  equivalent width of the main dib .",
    "similarly , for hd 204827 the ews of the 2 flanking dibs are 3 and 14 m  ( paper ii ) , compared to 518 m  for the main dib . for @xmath35797.1 and @xmath36204.5 , flanking dibs were formally identified in the atlas papers but , as noted above , we elected to include the wings in our ew measurements of the main dibs until identifications are secure .",
    "there are very few stellar lines blended with the dibs considered here .",
    "those present are generally weak .",
    "their treatment with respect to measuring equivalent widths is described in papers ii and iii .",
    "herbig ( 1993 ) noted the strong correlation between @xmath2(h )  and w@xmath21 .",
    "this relationship is shown in figure  [ nh_5780 ] for our sight lines .",
    "the correlation coefficient for this relationship is @xmath22 , when 3 stars are excluded from the sample : @xmath23 oph a , @xmath24 ori c , and hd 37061 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "these outliers were also rejected by herbig ( 1993 ) , who noted the remarkably high radiation field of the trapezium stars , and that both @xmath2(na )  and the dibs @xmath35780.5 and @xmath35797.1 are low with respect to @xmath2(h ) .",
    "these three stars are very weak in ( welty & hobbs 2001 ) .",

    "however , no saturation is indicated at similar line strengths in the correlations with other dibs , so it is unlikely that this is the cause of this distribution of points .",
    "if this is correct , it implies that @xmath35487.7 is getting stronger per h atom for high levels of @xmath35780.5 .",
    "most interstellar quantities will show a positive correlation with each other simply due to the increase of interstellar material with distance .",
    "this is most clearly reflected in the correlation of dibs with extinction .",
    "for the eight dibs considered here the correlation coefficients with @xmath0  range from @xmath69 ( table 4 ) , with an average of 0.82 .",
    "thus , we may regard r @xmath70 as the minimum required to indicate that two quantities are physically correlated at a significant level .    by this measure",
    "@xmath14 is the only dib in our study that is unambiguously well - correlated with @xmath2(h ) , and even in this case the outlier points ( figure  [ nh_5780 ] ) are prominent exceptions .",
    "these three stars have in common the presence of strong local radiation fields . noticing that the outliers have particularly low abundances of @xmath35780.5 relative to their h column densities compared to the general correlation",
    ", a possible explanation is that the radiation fields in these regions are hard enough to destroy the carrier of @xmath35780.5 , and that local radiation generally regulates dib abundances , which are likely characterized by distinct critical wavelengths of ionizing radiation .",
    "because all of the dibs are well correlated with @xmath35780.5 , with correlation coefficients @xmath71 ( table 5 ) , but only @xmath35780.5 is very well correlated with @xmath2(h )  ( table 2 ) , we infer that the critical energy for regulating @xmath35780.5 is similar to the energy that regulates the h abundance , and greater than that of the other dibs .",
    "we note that the destruction mechanism may be simple ionization , but it could also be dissociation .",
    "however , the apparent destruction effect in the presence of significant photon fluxes indicates that the @xmath35780.5 carrier might be an ion .",
    "these conclusions are supported by sonnentrucker at al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who examined the ionization properties of the dibs @xmath15780.5 , 5797.1 , 6379.3 , and 6613.6 .",
    "they conclude that the carriers of these dibs are separate gas - phase molecules . by comparing w@xmath72/@xmath0  as a function of @xmath0  for each dib , they find that @xmath14 reaches its maximum at the lowest value of @xmath0 , indicating that the carrier of this dib is the most resistant of the four dib carriers to strong uv fields .    while the main interstellar clouds in the three outlier sight lines are subject to higher than average radiation fields , they are not the only stars in our sample with this property . the na@xmath13i  and k@xmath13i  lines in the two trapezium sight lines , @xmath24 ori c and hd 37061 , are exceptionally weak , relative to @xmath2(h ) .",
    "@xmath23 oph a , however , is a bit puzzling .",
    "various sco - oph sight lines ( and some others in other regions ) exhibit relatively weak na@xmath13i  and k@xmath13i  ( welty & hobbs 2001 ) . for these targets",
    "only @xmath23 oph a is among the most discrepant in @xmath35780.5 @xmath26 @xmath2(h ) , but most other sco - oph sight lines tend to be deficient in @xmath35780.5 , as well .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a good quantitative measure of radiation field strength in many cases .",
    "one can use the higher h@xmath4  rotational level populations ( j=4,5 ) to estimate this , but the column densities of those levels are often very hard to determine accurately because the lines are generally on the flat part of curve of growth for most sight lines of interest here .",
    "we have no measure of h@xmath4toward hd 37061 and the higher j lines have not been reported toward @xmath23 oph a. the error on @xmath2(h@xmath4 )  toward @xmath24 ori c is among the largest in our sample . obtaining more extensive data on the strength of the radiation fields along a large number of sight lines would be a very interesting study .    if two dibs are formed from transitions between a single ground state and two different vibronic levels , their measured strengths should be perfectly correlated , with a correlation coefficient of unity .",
    "this is not quite true even for the best observed dib@xmath57dib correlation , @xmath73 @xmath26 @xmath74 mccall et al .",
    "( paper iv ) explore this particular pair and discuss the possibility that the true errors are underestimated .",
    "the most likely causes of such a situation are : 1 ) there are errors in continuum placement ; 2 ) there are blends of dibs that are not physically related ; and 3 ) there is uncorrected contamination from telluric water vapor lines .",
    "the first of these could be especially true for @xmath14 , which is superimposed on a much wider feature centered at 5778    ( herbig 1975 ; see also the combined spectral plots shown in figure 11 of papers ii and iii ) . without knowing the origin of the features that make up this blend ( krelowski , schmidt , & snow 1997 ) , it is hard to evaluate this effect . for the much narrower",
    "@xmath75 dib the second effect may be operative .",
    "the feature is multiple and the line shapes differ from star to star in our data ( see figure  [ dib8panel ] ) .",
    "we suspect the short wavelength contribution to this dib is a c@xmath4dib ( paper i ) , while the long wavelength component is more closely related to @xmath35780.5 .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the well - known @xmath76 effect of 5780.5 and 5797.1 : in the prototype `` @xmath46 '' sight line , @xmath46 sco , @xmath35780.5 is much deeper than @xmath35797.1 , while in the prototype `` @xmath65 '' sight line , @xmath65 oph , the depths of the two lines are comparable ( krelowski & sneden 1995 ) . the stars with high @xmath2(h@xmath4 )  and low @xmath39(5780 )",
    "are all @xmath77type stars , including strong c@xmath4  dibs , and produce a deep blueward component of the proposed c@xmath4  dib at 5797.1",
    ".    the @xmath76 effect might be more of a geometrical effect than an ionization effect .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath35780.5 is poorly correlated with trace neutral species , such as k@xmath13i  and na@xmath13i  ( welty et al .",
    "this is also true of other @xmath78 type dibs that are best correlated with @xmath2(h ) , such as @xmath3@xmath36283.8 , 6204.5 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath77type dib @xmath35797.1 is better correlated with the trace neutrals ( galazutdinov et al .",
    "these neutrals predominantly exist in the cores of clouds , which provide adequate shielding of the uv field , and where high molecular fractions of h@xmath4  exist due to self - shielding .",
    "these results are consistent with the @xmath78type dibs existing in the outer regions of clouds and the @xmath77type dibs existing deep in the interior of the clouds .",
    "the variable strength ratio of @xmath3@xmath35780.5 , 5797.1 has been discussed by several authors , such as krelowski , schmidt , & snow ( 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath35797.1 has the lowest correlation coefficient ( @xmath79 ) with @xmath35780.5 of any of the dibs in our study ( table 6 ) , even though it still exceeds the value expected from the general growth of interstellar material , as noted above .",
    "most of our sight lines penetrate multiple clouds and therefore average out these effects .",
    "cami et al . ( 1997 ) studied 13 stars with only single clouds along the lines of sight .",
    "they confirm the classification of dibs into four different families , including @xmath46 and @xmath80 however , the most convincing evidence of this hypothesis will come from mapping several clouds spatially by observing multiple stars at various locations behind the clouds .",
    "correlations among dibs and with neutral atoms and with molecules , such as h@xmath4 , c@xmath4 , cn , and ch will indicate whether the geometrical interpretation is correct .",
    "this is the subject of a future study by our group .",
    "examination of dibs that fall in the clean parts of the spectra of a number of stars indicate the presence of a number of interstellar absorption components .",
    "galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2002a , 2005 ) argue that most strong dibs have structure .",
    "while these authors conclude the structures are evidence of the r , p , q rotational structure of molecules of modest size , our study suggests that blends of unrelated dibs may be the origin of structure in some cases .",
    "the question of what features in the neighborhood of the main dib to include in the measurements of equivalent width is difficult .",
    "we do not have the fine spectral resolution of galazutdinov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and can not separate the blended features in two of our dibs , @xmath35797.1 and @xmath36204.5 , but we have a larger dataset at very high s / n .",
    "it is difficult even at high resolution to conclude whether lines have structure due to multiple components along a line of sight , blends of unrelated species , or structure from energy levels in a common carrier .",
    "even if we know in advance that dibs from two different carriers are involved , we still do not know what profiles to use in the deconvolution fitting process .",
    "we therefore measure the full ew of the blends .",
    "figure  [ dib8panel ] shows that the two features in the profile of @xmath36204.5 approximately scale with each other , and this dib has among the highest correlation coefficients with the other dibs ( table 5 ) and with @xmath2(h )  ( table 2 ) , and the correlation with @xmath35780.5 has low @xmath25 ( table 6 ) .",
    "in contrast , the features of @xmath35797.1 do not scale with each other , this dib has low correlation coefficients with the other dibs and @xmath2(h ) , and the correlation with @xmath35780.5 has very high @xmath25 .",
    "it would appear that the two features blended in the @xmath36204.5 feature we measure as one feature are either from the same carrier or from two separate carriers that are almost perfectly correlated .",
    "as previously noted , such considerations may help guide the correct placement of limits in future studies .",
    "examination of table 6 shows that the intercepts of the best fit lines pass through the origin for the correlation of @xmath14 with dibs @xmath15705.1 , 6204.5 , 5487.7 , and possibly @xmath15797.1 and 6196.0 .",
    "however , our data show that this is not true for @xmath36283.8 , and especially @xmath36613.6 .",
    "this may be evidence of a threshold effect , such that a substantial amount of 5780.5 must be produced before 6613.6 can begin to form .",
    "since @xmath2(h )  is very well correlated with @xmath14 , this implies that some minimum column density of h is required before the appearance of some dibs becomes evident .",
    "figure  [ 6283_5780 ] shows a possible threshold in the opposite sense .",
    "this is the only case in which the linear fit has a statistically significant positive intercept , indicating that 6283.8 appears before 5780.5 .",
    "in addition , below @xmath81m  there are significantly more points above the best fit line than below .",
    "below @xmath82m  the distribution flattens , with @xmath83 remaining approximately constant as @xmath28 decreases .",
    "this may be caused by two effects : 1 ) 6283.8 is among the broadest dibs in this study ( fwhm = 4.77 , table 2 ) , making continuum fitting somewhat less reliable than for narrower dibs .",
    "2 ) there is considerable telluric contamination in such a wide dib and our nightly blanket correction for telluric lines (  2 ) may introduce unrecognized errors .",
    "indeed , we estimate our minimum detectable dib equivalent width to be approximately 150m , about the same as the plateau in fig .",
    "[ 6283_5780 ] .",
    "this line is asymmetric and far from gaussian in shape , so it would not be evident from an inspection of the line profile if one or more interfering lines are present .",
    "one of the most useful results of this work is the ability to estimate the total column density of atomic hydrogen along a galactic sight line based on a measurement of the equivalent width of a single dib .",
    "the tight correlation between @xmath2(h )  and @xmath39(5780.5 ) shown in figure  [ nh_5780 ] demonstrates that this technique can be used in most cases , and in fact this has a higher correlation coefficient and lower @xmath25 than @xmath0@xmath84 @xmath2(h ) .",
    "however , the relationship fails to hold for the outlier stars , so care must be taken if the sight line passes through a region of high uv - radiation , assuming this influences the abundance of the dib carriers , as discussed above .",
    "a second empirical application is to compare the correlations presented here with correlations among the same features in other galaxies , in hopes that differences can be related to different physical properties of the galaxies and lead to an explantion of the dibs .",
    "for example , note that since @xmath2(ch )  and @xmath2(h@xmath4 )  are moderately well correlated ( welty et al . 2006 ) , the total h ( atomic plus molecular ) column density can be estimated for stars too faint to have measured far uv extinction curves .",
    "welty et al . ( 2006 ) examined the strengths of the @xmath15780.5 , 5797.1 , and 6283.8 dibs toward a relatively small number of stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "they found that the correlations of these with @xmath2(h)were lower than with @xmath0 , which is not true for most of the dibs in the current study .",
    "they also found that these dibs are systematically weaker relative to @xmath2(h )  than they are in the milky way by factors of @xmath85 ( in the lmc ) and @xmath86 ( in the smc ) , and weaker by about a factor of 2 relative to @xmath0 . in a slightly larger sample of stars with improved @xmath2(h )  for some sight lines , welty et al .",
    "( in preparation ) find that the correlations are slightly better than those reported in the earlier study but still not as good as ours for galactic sight lines .",
    "these differences may be due to lower metallicities or stronger radiation fields found in the clouds ; see welty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for additional discussion of these points .",
    "we have used a large database of high signal to noise ratio spectra of 133 stars to perform one of the most extensive comparisons to date between strengths of dib pairs and between dibs and @xmath2(h ) , @xmath2(h@xmath4 ) , and @xmath0 .",
    "we have presented linear fit parameters and correlation coefficients for these relationships .",
    "we reach the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "only one dib in our study , @xmath35780.5 , is unambiguously well - correlated with @xmath2(h ) , in the sense that the correlation coefficient exceeds what one would expect from the growth of interstellar material with distance .",
    "2 .   none of the dib ",
    "dib correlation coefficients considered here are high enough to conclude that any pair arises from the same carrier . however , as described in paper iv , the @xmath3@xmath36196.0@xmath576613.6 pair may be perfectly correlated if the errors were underestimated by a small amount .",
    "the correlation of the @xmath3@xmath35780.5@xmath575705.1 dibs is also very high and further study is warranted .",
    "seven of the eight dibs , excepting @xmath35487.7 , are better correlated with @xmath2(h )  than with @xmath0 .",
    "all eight dibs are very poorly correlated with @xmath2(h@xmath4 ) .",
    "even when we restrict the sight lines to those with log[@xmath2(h@xmath4 ) ] @xmath87 18 , the correlations are poor . at a single value of @xmath39(5780.5 )",
    "the column density of h@xmath4  can vary by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "this occurs just at the level of reddening corresponding to the formation of enough h@xmath4  to permit self - shielding .",
    "the excellent correlation of @xmath35780.5 @xmath26 @xmath2(h )  may be understood if the critical energy of radiation needed to ionize the two species is similar . the greater the flux of h ionizing radiation , the higher the degree of ionization of the @xmath35780.5 dib carrier .",
    "most of the linear fits to the dib ",
    "dib correlations pass through the origin .",
    "this is not true for @xmath3@xmath36283.8 and 6613.6",
    ". this may be due to continuum placement errors , the presence of interfering dibs , improperly corrected telluric contamination , or a threshold effect , in which one dib can not form until a significant amount of another dib is present .",
    "one of the most practical uses of the results presented here is the ability to estimate @xmath2(h )  in galactic sight lines based on a measurement of the equivalent width of @xmath3(5780.5 )",
    ". one must be careful to exclude sight lines in high radiation environments since these maybe responsible for the outliers in this otherwise tight relationship .",
    "in addition , the correlations presented here may be compared to correlations found in other galaxies , and this may help identify the carriers of dibs .    this work is based on observations obtained with the apache point 3.5 m telescope , which is owned and operated by the astrophysical research consortium .",
