    "large - scale star formation rates in galaxies are observed to correlate with both the gaseous and stellar content , and with the galaxy s gravitational potential well ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "empirical fits in disks often adopt power - law ( `` kennicutt - schmidt '' ) forms for the relationship among the surface density of star formation @xmath6 , the surface density of gas @xmath7 , the surface density of the old stellar disk @xmath12 , and the orbital angular velocity @xmath13 .    from the `` supply side '' point of view , gas represents the fuel for star formation , and the stellar disk and dark matter halo help to define dynamical timescales within the interstellar medium ( ism ) that could affect how rapidly gas collects and collapses : the galactic orbital time , the vertical oscillation period and flow crossing time , and the gravitational free - fall time .",
    "power laws naturally arise if the star formation rate is proportional to the ratio of the gas content and one of these dynamical times .",
    "the observed timescale for gas to be converted to stars , @xmath14 is , however , generally quite long compared to these dynamical times . together",
    ", the empirical results present a picture of star formation that is sensitive to both fuel supply and ambient environmental conditions , and that has low apparent efficiency .    in recent work ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter oml10 ) and @xcite ( hereafter os11 ) have argued that star formation rates respond to demand , as well as supply .",
    "maintaining an equilibrium state in the ism requires constant inputs of energy and momentum , and contributions from star formation are critical .",
    "star formation can be self - regulated via feedback , in such a way that supply and demand match within the ism : heating balances cooling , pressure balances gravity , and turbulent driving balances dissipation .",
    "the theory of oml10 and os11 proposes that observed star formation rates can be understood as a response to the needs of the ism . because each massive star injects so much energy , only a relatively modest star formation rate ( implying a long @xmath15 ) is necessary . from the point of view of energy and momentum sources and sinks , star formation is in fact quite efficient .    to see why feedback is vital , it is key to consider the internal thermal and dynamical state of the ism , rather than just integrated properties .",
    "the internal vertical dynamical time @xmath16 , for @xmath17 the total ( gas + stellar ) density , depends on the thicknesses of the gaseous and stellar disks .",
    "in particular , the contribution from gas gravity alone gives @xmath18 .",
    "the gas disk thickness @xmath19 depends ( linearly or quadratically ) on the vertical velocity dispersion of the gas , which includes both thermal and turbulent terms . because thermal energy is radiated away , and turbulent energy is dissipated ( in shocks and shear layers ) on timescales @xmath20 , the internal energy must be continuously replenished .",
    "young , high - mass stars restore this energy and preserve the life of the ism . if star formation feedback were entirely absent and the only heating source were the cosmic background radiation , @xmath21 would drop by nearly two orders of magnitude , with a corresponding ( or greater ) increase in @xmath6 .",
    "oml10 and os11 , considering respectively mid - to - outer disks and central starburst regions , showed that observed star formation rates are quantitatively consistent with analytic predictions that follow from imposing thermal and dynamical equilibrium in the diffuse ism .",
    "os11 also presented initial results of numerical simulations that include turbulent driving associated with star formation , confirming the analytic theory for molecule - dominated regions .",
    "additional results from simulations in the starburst regime will be presented in shetty & ostriker ( 2011 , in preparation ) .    in this paper , we use time - dependent numerical simulations to test the oml10 theory ( and extensions based on os11 ) , for the outer - disk regime where the ism is dominated by diffuse atomic gas .",
    "a crucial aspect of our simulations is that we vertically resolve the disk ( our grid scale is @xmath22 ) .",
    "we shall show that , as assumed by oml10 , thermal and vertical dynamical equilibrium are both satisfied in our numerical models .",
    "we shall also show that feedback from star formation is largely responsible for sustaining both the thermal and turbulent pressure ( and energy ) in the atomic ism .",
    "we numerically calibrate the yield relation between @xmath6 and the thermal and turbulent pressures in the diffuse ism , demonstrating that near - linear relations hold for both @xmath23 and @xmath24 . by combining these feedback relations with dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "we show that @xmath6 depends nearly linearly on the weight of the diffuse ism ( i.e. the dynamical - equilibrium pressure @xmath25 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( or @xmath11 ) is stronger and more general than other star formation relations that are commonly cited .",
    "in addition to testing the thermal / dynamical equilibrium theory of star formation , our numerical models allow us to address a number of interesting issues related to observations of diffuse atomic gas in the milky way and external galaxies @xcite .",
    "these observations show that ( 1 ) turbulent velocity dispersions are typically @xmath26 , relatively independent of location or star formation rate ; ( 2 ) both cold and warm atomic gas are pervasive , in proportions that appear relatively independent of location ; ( 3 ) the thermal pressure is a small fraction of the total pressure .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with these observations , and can be understood based on the thermal / dynamical equilibrium model with energy and momentum feedback from star formation .",
    "our numerical models are idealized in that they represent a local patch of unmagnetized gas in a featureless disk where star formation is primarily responsible for the injection of thermal and kinetic energies .",
    "thus , in this paper we do not capture the potential consequences of galactic structural features and certain instabilities that may affect ism dynamics and star formation .",
    "the ism surface density averaged over @xmath27 kpc scales can be significantly affected by large - scale gravitational instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , spiral arm compression ( e.g. @xcite ) , and parker instability ( e.g. @xcite ) . since the timescales to collect gas over @xmath28 kpc scales from gravitational instabilities and spiral arms are longer than local dynamical times , our models may nevertheless provide a good first approximation to the effects of star formation feedback on local regions within larger gas accumulations .",
    "in addition , initial tests we have conducted which include magnetic fields ( permitting parker instability ) show similar behavior to our unmagnetized models .    as well as producing @xmath27 kpc - scale overdensities , both gravitational instabilities ( e.g. @xcite ) and spiral shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) , together with magnetorotational instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , drive turbulence in the ism .",
    "in particular , turbulence levels @xmath29 can be produced by large - scale gravitational instability , and may be important during the highly - transient early evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "several of the above numerical models have shown , however , that unless energy ( representing feedback ) is locally injected into massive , high - density clumps that form , the result is irreversible gravitational collapse and star formation far exceeding observed rates .",
    "stellar feedback therefore appears to be crucial for disrupting bound clouds ( thus limiting star formation ) and maintaining  over many galactic orbits ",
    "turbulent ism levels similar to those observed in nearby galaxies .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we begin by summarizing the theory developed in oml10 and os11 .",
    "section 3 describes the numerical methods and parameters used for our time - dependent simulations , and section 4 presents our model results .",
    "these include time averages of star formation rates , thermal and turbulent pressures , gas layer scale - heights , thermal and turbulent velocity dispersions , and mass fractions of gas components . in section 5",
    ", we use our numerical results to test the validity of the physical assumptions and adopted parameters in the oml10 theory . here",
    ", we also demonstrate the balance between turbulent driving and dissipation ( as in os11 ) , and quantify the feedback yield relations between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we compare our numerical results to several simple prescriptions for star formation in section 6 .",
    "section 7 summarizes and discusses our main results .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the oml10 thermal / dynamical equilibrium model , highlighting the fundamental assumptions and predictions that we shall test in this work .",
    "we then draw on os11 to outline additional predictions related to the dynamical state and star formation rate in disks dominated by turbulent , diffuse gas , and describe how these hypotheses will be tested .",
    "oml10 considered a multiphase , turbulent galactic ism disk with thermal properties mediated by stellar heating . the gaseous disk , with total surface density of neutral gas @xmath7 , is immersed within the stellar disk and dark matter halo , whose combined midplane density is given by @xmath30 .",
    "the neutral gas disk is composed of two components : diffuse gas , with surface density averaged over large scales @xmath31 ; and gravitationally bound clouds ( gbcs ) with surface density averaged over large scales ( i.e. many individual bound clouds ) @xmath32 .",
    "the diffuse component includes both warm , rarefied gas and cold , dense gas in cloudlets that are not massive enough to be gravitationally bound .",
    "star formation takes place within the gravitationally - bound component .",
    "the first key assumption of oml10 is that the volume - filling diffuse ism disk is in force balance in the vertical direction .",
    "the combined inward gravitational force of the stars , dark matter , and gas ( both diffuse and gbc components ) must be matched by the outward pressure forces within the diffuse gas .",
    "averaging the vertical component of the momentum equation over time and in the horizontal direction , oml10 showed that in a state of dynamical equilibrium , @xmath33 for @xmath34}^{1/2}}\\right\\}};\\ ] ] that is , the total effective midplane pressure is actually a pressure _ difference _ between the midplane and the top of the neutral layer .",
    "thus , if the cosmic - ray and magnetic scale heights far exceed that of the neutral gas , there is not a significant contribution to @xmath35 from magnetic or cosmic - ray terms ( even if their midplane pressures are large ) , and the weight of the diffuse neutral layer must be supported primarily by turbulent and thermal pressure . ]",
    "@xmath35 must support the weight of the overlying diffuse gas in the total gravitational field .",
    "although we use the symbol @xmath11 to denote the vertical weight , it is important to note that the weight and effective pressure balance only if equilibrium holds , and only in an averaged sense .    in equation ( [ eq : ptotde ] ) ,",
    "@xmath36 is the ratio of total ( effective ) pressure to thermal pressure in the diffuse medium , @xmath37 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the gas density profile ( @xmath38 for a gaussian profile ) , @xmath39 is the thermal speed of the warm gas , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 the mass - weighted thermal velocity dispersion in the diffuse gas .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is also equal to @xmath43 for @xmath44 the warm medium density and @xmath45 the volume - averaged density of the diffuse medium ( including cold cloudlets , assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with the warm medium ) at the disk midplane .",
    "the mass fraction of the warm medium in the diffuse gas is comparable to @xmath42 ( see oml10 ) . in a state of dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "the midplane diffuse - gas thermal pressure @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 ( see equation 11 of oml10 ) . if the dominant contributions to the total effective pressure are thermal and turbulent terms with @xmath48 , then @xmath49 for @xmath50 the turbulent vertical velocity dispersion and @xmath51 the total vertical velocity dispersion in the diffuse gas ( @xmath51 is a direct observable for a face - on disk ) .",
    "note that in equation ( [ eq : ptotde ] ) , the product @xmath52 , which is equal to @xmath53 if turbulent and thermal terms dominate the effective pressure , i.e. @xmath54 .    next , oml10 assumed that the diffuse ism is in a state of thermal equilibrium , in which cold and warm atomic phases coexist at a midplane thermal pressure @xmath55 . in order for the diffuse gas to be in the two - phase regime",
    ", @xmath55 must fall between the minimum pressure @xmath56 for the cold phase and the maximum pressure @xmath57 for the warm phase ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . both @xmath57 and @xmath56 depend linearly on the local radiative heating rate per particle , @xmath58 , which itself depends approximately linearly on the locally - averaged star formation rate surface density , @xmath6 , if young massive stars are responsible for most of the heating .",
    "motivated by detailed modeling of heating and cooling in the solar neighborhood @xcite and numerical simulations of turbulent multiphase gas @xcite , oml10 assumed that @xmath55 is comparable to the geometric - mean pressure @xmath59 .",
    "based on the results of @xcite , oml10 adopted a geometric mean `` two - phase '' pressure given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath62 is the mean fuv intensity relative to the solar neighborhood value @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the surface density of neutral gas at the solar circle @xcite , and @xmath65 is the dust abundance relative to solar neighborhood value . in the solar neighborhood , @xmath66 for the oml10 prescription .    in a state of simultaneous thermal and dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "heating and cooling are in balance so that @xmath67 , and vertical forces are in balance so that @xmath68 . with @xmath69 ,",
    "the surface density of star formation should be proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , equating ( [ eq : pde ] ) and ( [ eq : ptwo ] ) yields an expression for the star formation rate , with @xmath6 proportional to the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : ptotde ] )  i.e. to the weight of the diffuse gas layer in the total gravitational field . in low - density outer - disk regions where the diffuse gas dominates gbcs ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , an approximate form for @xmath6",

    "the numerical coefficient in equation ( [ eq : sfrlow ] ) is calibrated based on the local milky way value @xmath74 @xcite .    in the case",
    "when @xmath75 is non - negligible , in order to obtain a closed set of equations , oml10 made the additional assumption that star formation within gbcs has a gas consumption timescale @xmath76 so that @xmath77 if gbcs have relatively uniform properties , then @xmath76 will be relatively constant . by equating ( [ eq : pde ] ) and ( [ eq : ptwo ] ) , and combining with equation ( [ eq : tsf ] ) , oml10 obtained a cubic equation that can be solved for @xmath6 as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath78 in the general case ; an approximate form is given by @xmath79}^{-1}\\ ] ] ( see eqs . 23 and a14 in oml10 ) .",
    "note that for low surface density outer disks , equation ( [ eq : sfrlow ] ) is recovered and @xmath6 is independent of @xmath76  i.e. the star formation rate becomes independent of the rate at which gas in gbcs collapses to make stars .    oml10 took @xmath80 based on the empirical linear correlation @xcite between the molecular mass in co and the sfr at 750 pc scale for a set of disk galaxies ( at moderate @xmath81 ) , and adopted @xmath82 and @xmath83 as typical values based on observations of the milky way and other well - studied disk galaxies .",
    "if the same set of parameters is adopted for all galaxies ( note that the dependence on @xmath84 in equation [ eq : sfrlow ] is weak : @xmath85 ) , @xmath6 is a function of just @xmath7 and @xmath78 .",
    "oml10 applied this formulation to azimuthally - averaged data for a sample of spiral galaxies to predict @xmath6 as a function of galactocentric radius @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting predicted profiles of @xmath6 are overall in remarkably good agreement with the observations .",
    "for a few galaxies , however , observed values of @xmath6 are offset from the prediction .",
    "the difference may owe to different values of @xmath36 , @xmath87 , and/or @xmath76 from the adopted values , or to effects associated with azimuthal averaging when there is strong spiral structure .",
    "it should also be noted that there are still significant uncertainties in the observations , which might lead to offsets with respect to the theory .",
    "empirical determinations of @xmath7 and @xmath76 are uncertain since some gas may be undetected in both 21 cm and co lines , and since the conversion factor @xmath88 from co to h@xmath89 can vary by a factor @xmath90 ( @xmath88 varies even more at low metallicity , and where @xmath91 ) .",
    "the age of the young - star population , as well as the treatment of extended vs. concentrated tracers of star formation , can also affect the empirical estimates of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , as discussed by oml10 , values of @xmath78 are uncertain as stellar disk thickness estimates for face - on galaxies are obtained via scaling relations rather than being directly measured .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the low-@xmath7 case , corresponding to outer disks where the gas is primarily diffuse and atomic . in this regime , @xmath6 is predicted to depend on @xmath36 and @xmath87 but not on @xmath76 , according to equation ( [ eq : sfrlow ] ) . using our numerical simulations , in which @xmath7 and @xmath78 are independent variables",
    ", we can directly test the primary assumptions of the oml10 theory . since we can measure @xmath36 , @xmath87 , @xmath31 ( and @xmath32 ) together with @xmath23 from the simulation outputs for any model",
    ", we can test whether the measured midplane thermal pressure in fact agrees with the dynamical equilibrium value @xmath92 predicted by equation ( [ eq : pde ] ) .",
    "we can also investigate whether the measured midplane @xmath23 is close to @xmath93 , following the hypothesis of oml10 that the system evolves to a state of thermal equilibrium having both a warm and cold atomic phase .",
    "similarly , we can test whether the sum of the measured thermal and turbulent pressures @xmath94 is consistent with the dynamical equilibrium prediction of equation ( [ eq : ptotde ] ) ( since the present simulations do not include magnetic fields , cosmic rays , or radiation pressure , these terms do not enter @xmath35 ) .",
    "further , we can check whether our numerical results for @xmath36 and @xmath87 agree with empirically - estimated values , and explore how much variation in @xmath36 and @xmath42 there is among models with different @xmath7 and @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we can compare the value of @xmath6 from the simulations with the theoretical prediction based on simultaneous thermal and dynamical equilibrium ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq : sfrlow ] ) .",
    "in addition to testing the theory of oml10 , we can use our numerical simulations to test more general ideas related to the self - regulation of star formation , as introduced by os11 .",
    "we consider the situation in which the ism is dominated by diffuse gas , so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we also assume the effective pressure is dominated by thermal and turbulent terms , and take @xmath97 and @xmath98 so that equation ( [ eq : ptotde ] ) for the weight becomes @xmath99}^{1/2}}\\right\\}}.\\ ] ] a simplified expression for @xmath11 , within 20% of equation ( [ eq : ptotdediff ] ) , is @xmath100 \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the vertical dynamical equilibrium equation is @xmath101    as noted above , it is expected that @xmath102 in a state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "in addition , os11 argued that if mechanical feedback from star formation provides the dominant contribution to the vertical turbulent motions , then the turbulent pressure @xmath24 should also scale roughly linearly with @xmath6 , as @xmath103 here , @xmath104 is the mean radial momentum injected by each massive star , @xmath105 is the total mass in stars formed per massive star , and the order - unity coefficient @xmath106 parameterizes the details of turbulent momentum injection and dissipation .",
    "when turbulence dominates the pressure and self - gravity dominates the vertical weight , equations ( [ eq : ptotdediff ] ) , ( [ eq : dyneq ] ) and ( [ eq : pturbsf ] ) with @xmath107 combine to yield a prediction that @xmath108 .",
    "os11 found that this prediction is in good agreement with both numerical simulations ( for a cold - gas dominated ism ) and with observations of molecule - dominated starburst regions with @xmath109 .",
    "more generally , if star formation is responsible for both heating and driving vertical motions in the diffuse ism , we expect the thermal and turbulent pressure contributions to scale roughly linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "normalizing relative to convenient dimensional units for observational comparison , we can define @xmath110 the parameters @xmath111 and @xmath112 are yield coefficients that measure the efficacy of feedback . for the fiducial parameters adopted in oml10 , @xmath113^{-1}$ ] , where the factor in square brackets is unity in the solar neighborhood . for the fiducial value @xmath114 adopted in os11 ( assuming supernovae are the most important sources of momentum ) , @xmath115 .",
    "note that with the heating and turbulent driving yield coefficients as defined in equations ( [ eq : etath ] ) and ( [ eq : etaturb ] ) , @xmath116 if only thermal and turbulent stresses contribute to the effective midplane pressure .",
    "we thus expect @xmath117 and @xmath118 under conditions similar to the solar neighborhood .",
    "the latter is comparable to the value @xmath119 adopted in oml10 for comparisons of equation ( [ eq : sfrboth ] ) with observations of @xmath6 . by exploring the relations between the measured values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath6 in our simulations",
    ", we can numerically evaluate @xmath120 and @xmath121 , testing whether these quantities ( and therefore @xmath36 ) are indeed near - constant .",
    "combining equations ( [ eq : dyneq ] ) , ( [ eq : etath ] ) and ( [ eq : etaturb ] ) , the self - regulated star formation rate in a diffuse - gas - dominated region where the pressure is controlled by energy and momentum feedback from massive stars has the form @xmath122 for outer - disk regions , equation ( [ eq : ptotdediff ] ) or ( [ eq : ptotdeap ] ) may be used for the ism weight @xmath11 . in galactic - center regions where the bulge potential exceeds that of the disk , @xmath123 for @xmath124 the bulge stellar density ( see os11 ) .    for very dust - poor systems , fuv radiation escapes more easily from star - forming regions and",
    "penetrates further in the diffuse ism , which may make the heating yield @xmath120 comparable to or even larger than @xmath121 ( see oml10 and @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in regions where @xmath7 is extremely high and reprocessed ir radiation is trapped , radiation pressure becomes important and a term @xmath125 would be included in equation ( [ eq : sfrfb ] ) .",
    "since the cosmic ray and magnetic pressures presumably increase with higher @xmath6 in analogy with equations ( [ eq : etath ] ) and ( [ eq : etaturb ] ) , corresponding feedback terms could be included in equation ( [ eq : sfrfb ] ) , with the values of @xmath126 and @xmath127 appropriately taking account of differing vertical scale heights compared to the neutral , star - forming gas ( see os11 ) .",
    "using our present simulations , we can test whether the generalized feedback - regulated star formation prediction @xmath128 is satisfied .",
    "we will also compare our results to the power - law form @xmath129 traditionally used in fitting observations , and to the form @xmath130 that is frequently adopted in numerical simulations of galaxy formation / evolution in the cosmological context .",
    "the numerical models of this paper investigate thermal and dynamical evolution of gas in a vertically stratified , differentially rotating , self - gravitating galactic disk under the influence of interstellar cooling , heating , and radiative and mechanical feedback from star formation .",

    "thus , we do not introduce a time delay prior to the momentum injection , or separately model effects of expanding regions or winds ( the former was previously considered in @xcite , which found that only relatively low levels of turbulence were induced in the diffuse ism ) . in this first study , our goal is primarily to incorporate turbulent driving in the diffuse ism at a realistic level for a given star formation rate , which is accomplished by simply injecting momentum impulsively .",
    "future work should improve this treatment , but experience with numerical models of turbulent giant molecular clouds has shown that much astronomical insight can be gained even when idealized treatments of turbulent driving are adopted @xcite .",
    "second , although our feedback treatment aims to model turbulent driving in the neutral warm / cold ism that is induced by sne , our approach does not attempt to model the high - temperature interiors of sn remnants themselves .",
    "previous work has shown that it is difficult to model sn explosions by injecting thermal energy in large scale simulations because of _ overcooling _ : radiative energy losses are too rapid due to lack of spatial resolution @xcite . at resolution levels that are affordable , far too little thermal energy ends up being converted to kinetic energy ; instead it is radiated away . in order to avoid overcooling , in some simulations radiative",
    "cooling is artificially turned off until blast waves have developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the initial sizes of regions where sn energy is injected are set such that the gas temperature @xmath242 , where a dip is present in the cooling function @xcite . for simulations such as ours which include self - gravity ,",
    "sn events occur within very dense regions . since the cooling rate is proportional to the square of the gas density , experiments we conducted with thermal energy injection and a coronal - gas cooling function showed that the cooling time was still unrealistically short at the resolution of our simulations , even if we adjusted the gas temperature to the dip of cooling function . thus , although hot gas created in sne may be quite important in many ways ( including driving galactic winds ) , the present models focus just on the warm / cold ism and star formation , and leave the interesting issues of the hot ism for future work .      since the photoelectric heating rate is proportional to the intensity of the fuv radiation field , we simply take @xmath243 , with a proportionality constant depending on the heating efficiency of small grains and pahs ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two sources of the fuv radiation field in outer disk : @xmath244 , the fuv radiation emitted by recently - formed ob stars locally in the disk , and @xmath245 , the metagalactic fuv radiation field .",
    "radiation originating in the inner regions of the galaxy could also reach the outer galaxy , but this contribution is smaller than the local radiation unless the optical depth is very low .    if fuv escapes into the diffuse ism from star - forming regions at the midplane at rate per unit area @xmath246 , then @xmath247/(4\\pi \\tau_\\perp)$ ] for @xmath248 the optical depth through the diffuse neutral ism , and @xmath249 the second exponential integral . as the radiative transfer factor depends only logarithmically on @xmath250 at low optical depth ,",

    "we do this by counting the number of the recent sn events , so that the sfr surface density is calculated by @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the time bin over which the sfr is averaged , and @xmath271 denotes the total number of sn events that occurred during the time span ( @xmath272 , @xmath273 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath6 corresponds to a space and time average of @xmath274 divided by the surface area . since only recent star formation contributes to gas heating via fuv radiation ,",

    "we also compare to the relation @xmath654 for @xmath644 the vertical crossing time , which limits how rapidly cold clouds can collect at the midplane .",
    "the fitted efficiencies are @xmath558 and @xmath573 , with a stronger correlation to the vertical crossing - time than free - fall - time prescription .",
    "the best star formation correlation we find is with the total midplane pressure  either as measured in the simulations ( @xmath9 ) , or as estimated from vertical dynamical equilibrium ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : numsfr ] ) fits @xmath6 within 16% for all models",
    "( excluding series r ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_p ] .",
    "series r shows that @xmath6 drops if the shielding is reduced ( higher @xmath258 ) .",
    "our numerical result that @xmath6 has a near - linear correlation with @xmath11 is consistent with the analytic models of oml10 and os11 for star formation in diffuse - gas dominated regions  either outer disks or starbursts .",
    "the near - linear relation between @xmath6 and @xmath11 is also consistent with a similar empirical result found by @xcite , and with the previous empirical findings that molecular gas ( the immediate precursor of star formation ) increases nearly linearly with the ism pressure @xcite .",
    "a relationship of the form @xmath655 ( see equation [ eq : ptotsfr ] ) implies that star formation responds to demand : the star formation rate increases until the midplane pressure ( controlled by thermal and turbulent feedback ) balances the vertical weight of the diffuse ism .",
    "that energy input from massive stars determines the midplane pressure and thus self - regulates the star formation rate suggests it is crucial to include stellar feedback , when simulating galactic star formation numerically .",
    "indeed , work by @xcite contemporary with the present study used sph simulations to show that @xmath6 is consistent with the observed kennicutt - schmidt relations only when feedback is included ( see also @xcite ) . without feedback ,",
    "dense clouds collapse in a runaway fashion , increasing the star formation rate by @xmath656 orders of magnitude . using grid - based simulations of milky - way - type galaxies , @xcite",
    "similarly found that star formation rates are at least an order of magnitude higher than observations if feedback is not included to drive turbulence and unbind dense clouds that form . including feedback is known to strongly affect the star formation history in long - term simulations of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stellar feedback also appears essential for driving and maintaining turbulence in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane over many galactic orbits .",
    "other proposed mechanisms for generating ism turbulence include large - scale gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , magnetorotational instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and non - steady motions generated in spiral shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) . turbulence driven by these processes has lower vertical than horizontal velocity dispersions , because they all tap galactic rotation .",
    "rotational - gravitational instabilities are able to produce turbulence levels comparable to observed values , although vertical dispersions drop to @xmath657 after several galactic orbits @xcite . in addition , gravitationally - driven turbulence is dominated by large scales ( i.e. , clump - to - clump motions ) that do not prevent collapse within clumps . without stellar feedback to unbind dense clouds that form ,",
    "the resulting star formation rates are too high .",
    "gravitationally - driven turbulence is likely to be most important during the transient , gas - rich early stages of galaxy formation at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "characterizing turbulence in galaxies requires subtraction of a `` background state , '' and this becomes more difficult to define when there are large secular motions including prominent radial flows and collapsing clumps .",
    "even steady spiral shocks create a ( steady ) azimuthal velocity profile that can differ by tens of @xmath396 from the background rotation curve .",
    "it will be interesting to analyze in detail how non - stellar processes combine with stellar feedback to power turbulence over both large and small scales in disk galaxies , providing a more complete understanding of galactic star formation over all redshifts .",
    "as noted above , the present numerical models involve radical simplifications compared to the real star - forming ism . given the success of these simple models , it is clearly worthwhile to pursue further computational modeling along similar lines , improving on the numerical idealizations we have made .",
    "one of the advantages of local numerical models that resolve @xmath658 is that the scales involved directly correspond to those accessible in high - resolution observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "results from successive model refinements can be compared to observations to identify a `` minimal physics '' set , incorporating only the most important effects to minimize computational cost .    by employing high - resolution ism simulations to identify the key processes controlling star formation",
    ", it will be possible to enhance subgrid models for computational galaxy formation studies in the cosmological context .",
    "while feedback to drive turbulent pressure plays a dominant role in the ism of the milky way and similar galaxies , feedback to drive thermal pressure is likely to be increasingly important where there is minimal dust shielding , potentially leading to large @xmath258 and @xmath659 .",
    "some current simulations of dust - poor galaxies at high redshift use subgrid shielding models to estimate the abundance of cold , star - forming gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . a subgrid model that incorporates both shielding and turbulence could potentially bridge over a wide range of redshifts .",
