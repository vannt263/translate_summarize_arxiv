    "in numerical modelling of physical phenomena two approaches are feasible . on the one hand",
    ", one can develop a model as detailed , as possible .",
    "then an obvious difficulty is encountered : usually simplifications are necessary , owing to complexity of natural phenomena and/or lack of precise data .",
    "nevertheless , if the model is accurate enough , it displays behaviour similar to that of the underlying physical system , when fixed parameter values equal or close to those in the original system are employed . on the other hand , one can consider a class of approximate models , reflecting only global features of the underlying physical system .",
    "parameter values are varied in order to study how this affects the overall behaviour of the system .",
    "the second approach is advantageous in that properties characterising the class of systems are revealed ; computationally it is usually less demanding , than the first one .",
    "we follow the second approach to examine a succession of temporal regimes which can occur in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) systems , when reynolds numbers are increased .",
    "in particular , we are concerned with two questions : which features of mhd systems are responsible for magnetic field reversals  an attribute of the earth s magnetic field ? which sequences of bifurcations can bring an mhd system to such a regime ?    a comprehensive review of low - dimensional ode dynamo models of magnetic field reversals of the earth , discussed in literature prior to 1994 , can be found in jacobs ( 1994 ) , chapter 5 .",
    "the models were categorised into two distinct classes . in the models of the first class",
    "it was assumed that reversals were related to mhd instabilities , triggered by finite - amplitude perturbations of otherwise stable nonlinear dynamos .",
    "the perturbations were supposed to be controlled by random processes , and various physical mechanisms of non - mhd nature were proposed as their possible sources . in models of the second class the reversals were a feature of the system , with no external perturbations required to initiate a reversal .",
    "the model of solar magnetic field reversals by zeldovich _",
    "et al . _ ( 1983 ) also falls within this class .",
    "( 1996 ) and moroz _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) generalised the rikitake s disk model .",
    "armbruster _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) proposed a 7-dimensional ode dynamo model obtained by center manifold reduction with the use of symmetry considerations .",
    "they considered convection in a spherical shell without rotation for such parameter values , that mode interaction took place and heteroclinic cycles emerged in the phase space , connecting the 7 equilibria present in their system .",
    "the heteroclinic cycles were stable due to the symmetries of the system .",
    "introduction of magnetic field could transform the hydrodynamic equilibria into mhd ones , with a non - vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the resultant heteroclinic cycles involved changes of orientation of the magnetic field , i.e. , reversals of the magnetic dipole ( non - dipole magnetic components were ignored in their truncated system ) .    in the model of melbourne _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) reversals were also linked with an underlying heteroclinic cycle . to obtain the cycle , they considered convection in a spherical shell with rotation and derived a normal form near a codimension-3 bifurcation , assuming that the flow sustaining the dynamo possessed a certain group of symmetries . the normal form , truncated up to terms of the third order , involved 9 parameters .",
    "when several higher - order small symmetry - breaking terms were added in the normal form , for some parameter values the behaviour of the system resembled the earth s magnetic field reversals .",
    "reversals were observed in simulations of mhd systems with the geometry and boundary conditions corresponding to those of the earth in the model ( glatzmaier and roberts , 1995 , 1996 ; roberts and glatzmaier , 2001 ) , involving the navier - stokes equation with the coriolis , buoyancy and lorentz forces , the magnetic induction and the temperature equations .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional model with a limited resolution in the azimuthal direction , derived from these pde s , also featured magnetic reversals ( sarson and jones , 1999 ; sarson , 2000 ) .",
    "magnetic field generated in these models was predominantly dipolar ; the lengths of time intervals of constant polarity and a short duration of each reversal were consistent with those of the earth . however , the computations were very demanding in cpu time , prohibiting numerical identification of complex bifurcations in such systems .    in simulations of glatzmaier and roberts reversals were robust .",
    "glatzmaier and roberts ( 1996 ) used a modified set of equations ( compared to the one studied by glatzmaier and roberts , 1995 : compositional buoyancy was added and the anelastic approximation was used instead of the boussinesq approximation ) , but this did not result in significant changes of the temporal behaviour of magnetic field . despite the model",
    "was run very far from the regime of the geophysical parameter values ( jones , 2000 ) , there was a strong similarity between the model output and the geodynamo .",
    "this is another indication that their mhd attractor is structurally stable ( i.e. , persists when equations , geometry , or parameter values are considerably varied ) .",
    "roberts and glatzmaier ( 2001 ) considered three different radii of the inner core , corresponding to its present size and some values in the past and in the future ( geodynamo was driven by the energy influx due to the latent heat release at the freezing surface of the inner core , slowly growing in time ) .",
    "again , in all the three cases magnetic field of comparable strength was generated , and the magnetic field exhibited a quantitatively similar temporal behaviour , the system in the future displaying a stronger temporal variability .",
    "equations of magnetohydrodynamics are invariant under the symmetry , which preserves flows @xmath1 and changes orientation of magnetic fields @xmath2 : @xmath3 one can anticipate the following scenario of development of a temporal regime involving magnetic field reversals .",
    "suppose for certain values of a control parameter the system possesses a stable steady state , in which magnetic field vanishes .",
    "when the parameter is varied beyond the critical value , two steady states with a non - vanishing magnetic field emerge in a pitchfork bifurcation ( generic to systems with the symmetry ( 1 )  ) . in subsequent bifurcations the steady states bifurcate into more complex attractors , related by ( 1 ) and remaining so far distinct .",
    "as the parameter is further varied , the attractors of the system join ( e.g. , due to collision of attractors , or via heteroclinic connection ) and a unique attractor emerges . a sample trajectory on the attractor jumps between former attractors ( which degenerate into unstable invariant sets ) .",
    "since the jumps involve changes in the magnetic field orientation , the resulting intermittency can thus be linked with the reversals .",
    "the goal of the present study is to check whether this scenario is feasible . as a test case",
    "we consider the navier - stokes equation @xmath4 and the magnetic induction equation @xmath5 under the solenoidality conditions @xmath6 here @xmath1 is velocity of the flow , @xmath2  magnetic field , @xmath7  pressure , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are kinematic and magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "( since in the problem under consideration characteristic length and velocity magnitudes are of order one , the reynolds numbers are defined as inverse viscosity and inverse magnetic diffusivity , respectively . )",
    "the fields are supposed to be @xmath10-periodic in space .",
    "the force @xmath11 is assumed , where @xmath12 is an abc flow @xmath13 for this force , @xmath14 is a steady solution to ( 2)-(4 ) for all reynolds numbers .",
    "this particular system is considered for the following reasons : first , space periodicity enables one to use pseudo - spectral methods ( see canuto _",
    "_ , 1989 ; boyd , 1989 ) , which are computationally efficient .",
    "second , linear stability of the system ( 2)-(5 ) to hydrodynamic ( galloway and frisch , 1987 ; podvigina and pouquet , 1994 ; podvigina , 1999 ) and magnetic ( arnold and korkina , 1983 ; galloway and frisch , 1986 ; galanti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ; childress and gilbert , 1995 ) perturbations has been investigated both numerically and analytically ( nonlinear regimes for some parameter values were also explored by podvigina and pouquet , 1994 ; podvigina , 1999 ; galanti _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ; feudel _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; brummell _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "these studies provide guidance , in what parameter ranges the targeted type of behaviour may be observed . in particular , growing magnetic modes exist for the flow ( 3 ) in broad intervals of constants @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "third , since the critical magnetic reynolds number is typically of the order of 10 , only moderate @xmath9 need to be considered , and a relatively low resolution ( @xmath18 fourier harmonics ) suffices .",
    "magnetic field growth rates were calculated by galanti _",
    "( 1992 ) for the flow ( 4 ) with the coefficients satisfying @xmath19 for various values of @xmath9 . for @xmath20",
    "there are three windows in @xmath21 of positive growth rates ( see fig .  2 ibid . ) .",
    "we have checked that in the window @xmath22 the dominant eigenvalue is real , and in the other two windows it is complex .",
    "distinct steady states with a non - zero magnetic field appear in a bifurcation of the trivial steady state ( 5 ) , only if the magnetic induction operator has a zero ( hence real ) eigenvalue at the bifurcation point .",
    "this has suggested to set @xmath23 these values of constants in ( 4 ) are assumed throughout .    with our goal in mind , in the present study we focus at non - hydrodynamic attractors .",
    "the hydrodynamic global stability of @xmath12 guarantees that magnetic field does not vanish in saturated regime , if @xmath24 is a kinematic dynamo .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath25 , @xmath24 is a unique attractor of the hydrodynamic system (  ( 2.a , c ) with @xmath26 ) , and most computations are made for this value of @xmath8 .",
    "several runs are also performed for higher @xmath8 .",
    "the group of symmetries without inversion of time of an abc flow with @xmath27 , which we denote by @xmath28 , is comprised of two independent symmetries @xmath29 @xmath30 their superpositions @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 and the identity transformation @xmath36 ( arnold , 1984 ; dombre _ et al . _ , 1986 ; podvigina and pouquet , 1994 ) .",
    "the group is isomorphic to the symmetry group of a square , @xmath37 .",
    "any symmetry of the force ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) which does not involve inversion of time is also a symmetry of the navier - stokes equation ( 2.a ) with @xmath26 .",
    "the group of symmetries of the mhd system ( 2)-(4 ) , ( 6 ) , which we denote by @xmath38 , is a direct product of @xmath28 and the 2-element group @xmath39 , generated by @xmath40 ( 1 ) .",
    "it has 16 elements , which are either @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "problems in hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics ( see e.g. the review by crawford and knobloch , 1991 ) often involve symmetries , induced by the geometry of the region where fluid is contained . in particular , if convection in a plane layer is restricted to space - periodic flows with equal periods along two cartesian axes parallel to boundaries , and conditions at the boundaries are different , the group of symmetries of the system is isomorphic to @xmath28 . if in addition magnetic field is present , the symmetry group is isomorphic to @xmath38 . thus , though the system under consideration ( 2)-(4 ) , ( 6 ) is highly symmetric ,",
    "it can not be regarded as an exotic one .",
    "symmetries are useful for categorisation of attractors .",
    "let @xmath43 be an attractor of a dynamical system , invariant under a symmetry @xmath44 : @xmath45 .",
    "two cases can be distinguished : either @xmath43 is pointwise invariant , i.e.  @xmath46 for all points @xmath47 , or it is invariant only as a set , with @xmath48 for some . in",
    "what follows , only the symmetries for which an attractor is pointwise invariant are regarded as symmetries of the attractor .",
    "attractors , detected for the mhd system with the forcing ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) for @xmath25 and @xmath49 .",
    "the third column shows the number of elements of the symmetry group for which an attractor is pointwise invariant , and the fourth column ",
    "generators of the group .",
    "indices in the labels of attractors ( second column ) have the following meaning . for periodic orbits emerging in the period doubling cascade",
    "the superscript @xmath50 refers to an @xmath51-period orbit , @xmath52 being the period of the foremost orbit .",
    "the first subscript labels different attractors of a given kind .",
    "the second subscript labels mutually symmetric attractors .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath53 @xmath54 for @xmath55 was traced back from @xmath56 ; it is not observed for @xmath57 .    for @xmath58",
    "the detected attractor is the torus @xmath59 ( which is an attractor for @xmath25 and @xmath60 ) . for @xmath57 reversals",
    "take place , similar to those observed for @xmath25 and @xmath61 , and the attractor is @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for @xmath8 close to 4 no new attractors are found .",
    "for @xmath55 a new attractor was found in the full mhd system  a periodic orbit @xmath63 with a symmetry group of 8 elements .",
    "comparison of tables 2 and 3 reveals no relation of attractors of the hydrodynamic and mhd systems for @xmath55 , 15 and 20 . for these reynolds numbers a small magnetic field ( magnetic energy @xmath64 is below 0.07 ; see table  2 ) drastically changes behaviour of the system  the hydrodynamic and mhd systems have attractors of different types , and the average kinetic energy @xmath65 decreases significantly , e.g. @xmath66 and @xmath65 decreases from 0.9 ( the hydrodynamic case ) to 0.7 ( the mhd case ) for @xmath67 .    for @xmath56 behaviour of the sample trajectory of the mhd system in saturated regime",
    "is chaotic .",
    "but before the saturated regime sets in , the trajectory is attracted by @xmath63 and for @xmath68 remains close to this periodic orbit ( see fig .",
    "13 ) , which is now weakly unstable .",
    "for @xmath67 the trajectory with the same initial condition is attracted to a new torus @xmath69 ; initially the temporal behaviour of the trajectory resembles the one observed for @xmath56 ( cf .",
    "figs .  14 and 14 ) .",
    "for @xmath70 the mhd system possesses new chaotic attractors @xmath71 with a trivial symmetry group .",
    "they resemble the chaotic attractor @xmath72 observed for @xmath56 ( cf .",
    "fig .  13 and fig .",
    "15 ) , but unlike @xmath71 , @xmath72 is unique and has a symmetry group of four elements .",
    "comparison of @xmath71 with the attractor of the non - magnetic navier - stokes equation , which also is chaotic , reveals that the influence of magnetic field is in some sense stabilising : fourier coefficients of the flow experience fewer jumps and the amplitude of their oscillations is much smaller ( compare fourier components of flows on figs .",
    "15b and 16b ) .",
    "an exponential growth of the initially small magnetic field in the sample evolution of the system begins only at @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "accordingly , until @xmath74 the flow evolution is similar to the one in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field starts growing , when the trajectory is attracted by a weakly unstable periodic orbit in the hydrodynamic subspace .",
    "departure from this orbit causes an initial decay of magnetic field before the onset of saturated behaviour .    for @xmath56 and 20 behaviour of fourier components of magnetic field",
    "is similar to the one shown on fig .",
    "it consists of chaotic irregular small - period oscillations about zero , different from the behaviour observed for @xmath25 .",
    "thus for @xmath75 , @xmath76 the considered system is not in a regime resembling reversals .",
    "the bifurcation scenario leading to emergence of reversals , which we put forward , proves feasible .",
    "reversals are found for small @xmath8 , for which the hydrodynamic system has a unique globally stable steady state .",
    "complexity of the sequence of bifurcations obtained in simulations is comparable to that of the hydrodynamic system examined by podvigina and pouquet ( 1994 ) and podvigina ( 1999 ) .",
    "numerous types of behaviour are identified , which involve a large variety of attractors and unstable invariant sets of various types affecting behaviour of evolutionary solutions .",
    "the regime of reversals arises as a result of merging of two distinct attractors , apparently via heteroclinic connection due to intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits ( in contrast to the system of armbruster _",
    "( 2001 ) , where a heteroclinic cycle emerged simultaneously with magnetic steady states ) .",
    "other regimes with a non - zero magnetic field are observed when any of the reynolds numbers is increased .",
    "thus in our computations reversals are not so robust , as in simulations of glatzmaier and roberts .",
    "the range of parameters considered here is rich in bifurcations : for @xmath25 we found 14 bifurcations in the interval @xmath77 ( counting the infinite number of period - doubling bifurcations as one ) , 7 distinct types of attractors involve magnetic field reversals . in another dissimilarity with the results of glatzmaier and roberts ( and with the earth s magnetic field ) in our simulations ( cf .",
    "@xmath78 for the geodynamo ) . in our computations reversals appear more regular than those in the earth , since much smaller values of reynolds numbers are considered .",
    "the dissimilarity with reversals in the earth also owes to the fact that we solve a simplified system of pde s ( neither an account of thermal or sedimentation - driven convection is taken , nor that of the coriolis force ) in an idealised space - periodic geometry",
    ". nevertheless , it appears possible to mimick the presence of two time scales ( average periods of constant polarity are much longer than the average time of a reversal itself ) ; instances of excursions of magnetic field ( i.e. , incomplete reversals ) can be observed as well ( see e.g. figs . 8a and 10 ) .",
    "our results show that magnetic field reversals are an inherent feature of a nonlinear dynamical system of the mhd type .",
    "the fundamental reason for their existence is the symmetry @xmath40 , changing polarity of the magnetic field .",
    "neither external triggering random processes , such as the ones postulated in earlier studies , nor symmetry breaking due to inhomogeneity of the outer core boundaries , nor rotation , nor a specific heteroclinic structure or symmetries of the flow sustaining a non - linear dynamo are required to give rise to a sequence of reversals .",
    "such physical processes , as heat transfer or sedimentation are also unnecessary _ per se _ ( as soon as the system is under the action of any body force providing input of energy ) .",
