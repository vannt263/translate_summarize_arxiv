    "the dielectric response of a collisionless plasma is an ubiquitous quantity in plasma physics and in the many - body theory of coulomb systems in general . for a fermionic system ,",
    "it was first derived by lindhard @xcite and is closely related to the dielectric function @xmath1 in random phase approximation @xcite . in this way ,",
    "the dielectric response is connected to collective effects such as screening , plasmons , and landau damping .",
    "its knowledge is also important for non - ideal plasmas , since the effects of non - ideality are typically parameterized by dynamic local field corrections with respect to the ideal response @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the ideal dielectric response for fermionic systems has been reported by arista and brandt @xcite . here",
    ", we retain this restriction to fermions , although a treatment for bosonic systems is possible in a similar manner .",

    "the dielectric response enters a number of important physical observables such as optical properties @xcite , the single - particle self - energy in @xmath20 approximation @xcite , and the dynamical collision frequency @xcite .",
    "a fast and reliable computation is therefore of crucial importance to obtain these quantities .",
    "however , a direct evaluation of the integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : gx ] ) is often too slow in many applications .",
    "thus , approximative analytical expressions for @xmath4 are desirable",
    ".    continued fractions appear in a variety of applications in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "also , they are of importance in approximation theory and are closely related to pad approximants which in turn enjoy a number of interesting applications in various fields @xcite . in particular , there is a close correspondence between t - fractions @xcite and two point pad approximations , see refs .",
    "since an expansion of @xmath4 at @xmath21 and at @xmath22 is known , the t - fractions representation suggests itself as a powerful approximation . also , due to the compact form of the continued fraction , only a few fitting parameters have to be given .",
    "following arista and brandt @xcite , we can consider the expansion of @xmath4 for small and large values of @xmath23 and obtain @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermi integral of order @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 being an integer , @xmath29 an odd number .",

    "we follow the notation introduced in ref .  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "once the expansions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 are known to be of the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 with expansion coefficient @xmath43 and a complex variable @xmath40 , the t - fraction representation can be generated by a q - d algorithm provided that all expansion coefficients are different from zero .",
    "a modified q - d algorithm has been developed by de andrade et al .",
