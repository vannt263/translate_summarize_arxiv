    "if @xmath2 is a cfc element , @xmath2 is logarithmic if and only if a ( equivalently , any ) reduced expression @xmath372 of @xmath2 has full support ( i.e all generators occur in @xmath372 ) . in particular",

    "let @xmath2 be in @xmath37 and let @xmath31 be one of its reduced expressions .",
    "assume that @xmath372 has not full support .",
    "in this case , @xmath2 belongs to a proper parabolic subgroup of @xmath0 , which is a finite coxeter group by a classical property of affine coxeter groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so @xmath2 is not logarithmic , and there is a finite number of such elements , which correspond to elements satisfying ( a ) in theorems  [ thmantilde ] , [ thmbtilde ] , [ thmctilde ] , [ thmdtilde ] and such that at least one generator does not occur in @xmath31 .",
    "+ conversely , assume that @xmath2 is a cfc element with full support . according to theorems  [ thmantilde ] , [ thmbtilde ] , [ thmctilde ] , [ thmdtilde ] , @xmath372 must satisfy ( b ) or ( c ) or has to be a coxeter element ( @xmath465 each generator occurs exactly once in * w * ) . if @xmath2 is a coxeter element , @xmath2 is logarithmic ( see @xcite ) .",

    "( c ) ) and is therefore reduced .",
    "it follows that @xmath2 is logarithmic .",
    "we can also notice that the powers of coxeter elements are always cfc in affine types @xmath5 and @xmath470 because they satisfy the alternating word condition , but are never cfc elements in types @xmath350 and @xmath8 ( because they satisfy neither the alternating word condition nor condition ( c ) ) .",
    "a natural question that arises in the study of fc elements is to compute the number of fc involutions in finite and affine coxeter groups ( as this number is , for some groups , the sum of the dimensions of irreducible representations of a natural quotient of the iwahori - hecke algebra associated to the group , see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , we now focus on cfc elements which are involutions .",
    "the main result is that there is always a finite number of such elements in all coxeter groups , and we are able to characterize them in terms of words .",
    "we also use the characterization of cfc elements to enumerate cfc involutions in finite and affine coxeter groups .",
    "[ finiteness ] let @xmath0 be a coxeter group and let i(@xmath0 ) be its subset of involutions .",
    "the set @xmath471i(@xmath0 ) is finite .",

    "let @xmath2 be a cfc involution , let s be a generator in @xmath461 and @xmath31 be a reduced expression of @xmath2 .",

    "consider a cyclic shift @xmath475 of @xmath31 which begins with s. as @xmath2 and s are involutions , @xmath175 is an expression of an involution .",
    "moreover as @xmath2 is cfc , @xmath175 corresponds to a fc element @xmath386 . according to @xcite , a fc element @xmath2 is an involution if and only if r(@xmath2 ) is palindromic , i.e r(@xmath2 ) includes the reverse of all of its members .",
    "applying this to @xmath175 allows us to say that @xmath175 is commutation equivalent to a word @xmath476 .",
    "so a cyclic shift of @xmath31 is commutation equivalent to @xmath477 , which is in contradiction with the cfc property of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath478 .",
    "we consider @xmath175 as before . as r(@xmath386 ) is palindromic , we can conclude that all generators in @xmath479=@xmath461 commute with s.    [ remarkinv ] the number of cfc involutions in a coxeter group @xmath0 depends only on the edges of the coxeter diagram , without taking into account the values @xmath18 .",
