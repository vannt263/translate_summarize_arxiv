    "the two - dimensional potts model pervades statistical physics and is a vivid illustration of the strong ties between conformal field theory ( cft ) , integrability , algebra , and probability theory . for @xmath3",
    "$ ] , and on the square lattice , it exhibits integrable points corresponding to second - order phase transitions , in both the ferromagnetic @xcite and the antiferromagnetic @xcite regimes .    while the integrable aspects emerge from transforming the potts model into a vertex model , the conformal properties are best investigated by transforming it into a loop model @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit of the ferromagnetic case is the well - studied compactified boson cft .",
    "the antiferromagnetic case hase only been understood very recently : it corresponds to a compact boson coupled to another non compact boson @xcite and provides a statistical physics realisation of the euclidean black hole sigma model @xcite which has been extensively studied in a string theory context @xcite .",
    "in the theory of disordered systems there is a strong motivation to study the potts model with quenched bond randomness . in a perturbative cft approach",
    "@xcite this corresponds to the replica limit ( @xmath4 ) of a system of @xmath5 potts models coupled by the term @xmath6 in the action , where @xmath7 denotes the local energy operator ( @xmath8 in kac notation ) of replica @xmath9 .",
    "this term is relevant in the renormalisation group ( rg ) sense for @xmath10  an observation which provides the basis for the perturbative expansion around @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , apart from the perturbative cft results , the progress on the random - bond potts model has mainly been numerical @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can study the coupled replicas for finite , integer @xmath12 .",
    "the perturbative cft predicts a non - trivial fixed point @xmath13 for @xmath14 for which a variety of critical exponents can be computed perturbatively , in agreement with numerical transfer matrix results and a duality analysis @xcite . the case @xmath15 is special , since all terms in the beta function , except the leading one , contain the factor @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly the perturbative expressions for the critical exponents are singular at @xmath15 .",
    "analytical progress has been limited , this far , to this case of @xmath15 coupled models . for @xmath11",
    "this is known as the ashkin - teller model @xcite , which can be solved through a mapping to the eight - vertex model @xcite .",
    "the coupling term is here exactly marginal and leads to a line of critical points along which the critical exponents vary continuously . for @xmath10 , and in the case where the potts spins",
    "interact ferromagnetically , a field theoretical analysis reveals that the perturbation makes the model massive @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the duality analysis and transfer matrix computations @xcite , as in this case the two models couple strongly to form a single @xmath17-state model which is non critical ( since @xmath18 ) .",
    "there however exists another , integrable case of two coupled potts models , which was found by au - yang and perk @xcite by direct solution of the star - triangle equation ; see eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) in that paper .",
    "this line of integrable points was further investigated by martins and nienhuis @xcite ( it is called solution 2 in their paper ) , who established the corresponding bethe ansatz equations .",
    "they also showed that there are two regimes within the range @xmath19 , each one corresponding to distinct critical behaviour .",
    "martins and nienhuis were mainly interested in the case @xmath20 which can be interpreted as a lorentz lattice gas .",
    "it belongs to the first regime , with @xmath21 , throughout which the potts interaction is ferromagnetic and the two models decouple in the continuum limit . the second regime , with @xmath1 ,",
    "was only treated briefly , and numerical evidence of an effective central charge @xmath22 was given .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we shall focus on this second regime , @xmath1 , for which the potts interaction is _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ and the energy - energy coupling between the two models is relevant by the perturbative cft analysis .",
    "fendley and jacobsen @xcite presented a detailed analysis of this case , based on the level - rank duality @xcite of the @xmath23 birman - wenzl - murakami ( bwm ) algebras @xcite .",
    "parameterising @xmath0 as @xmath24 they found that these theories correspond @xcite to the conformal coset @xmath25 with central charge @xmath26    the purpose of this paper is to study further this integrable case of two coupled antiferromagnetic potts models .",
    "we shall see that the integrable @xmath27 matrix is equivalent to that of @xmath28  also known as the @xmath2 model  in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "this allows us in particular to identify and study in details the corresponding bethe ansatz equations .. ]    on a more fundamental level , this equivalence places the two coupled potts models into the family of @xmath29 models whose first member we have recently investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "this @xmath30 model is related to the well - known o(@xmath31 ) model on the square lattice @xcite , and our study @xcite concentrated on the so - called regime iii , a model of dilute loops that contains a special point ( @xmath32 ) which is a candidate for describing the theta - point collapse of polymers @xcite .",
    "using both analytical arguments and extensive numerical analysis we established that the @xmath30 model in regime iii has a non compact continuum limit that turns out to be precisely the same as that of the antiferromagnetic potts model @xcite , namely that of the @xmath33 euclidean black hole cft @xcite .",
    "we show here that the @xmath2 model , relevant for describing two coupled potts models , also has a non compact continuum limit , albeit now involving three rather than two bosons [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) ] .",
    "the range @xmath1 in which the potts models couple non - trivially corresponds precisely to the interesting regime iii . just like in the @xmath30 counterpart ,",
    "the `` spectrum '' of critical exponents in the @xmath2 model contains both continuous and discrete states , with the discrete states emerging from  and redisappearing into  the continuum upon changing the twist .",
    "the twist is here controlled by two angles ( rather than one in the @xmath30 case ) that correspond to modifying the weights of the non contractible loops in each of the two potts models .",
    "we provide the critical exponents of the magnetic - type operators , as functions of the two twists , and infer from those the scaling dimensions @xmath34 of the so - called watermelon operators in the potts model , corresponding to the insertion of any given number @xmath35 of propagating `` through - lines '' in each of the two potts models .    to keep the presentation light , the analysis given here is mainly based on analogies with the @xmath30 case and on an extensive numerical analysis of the bethe ansatz equations . a more formal treatment , that corroborates the present analysis , will appear elsewhere in the general @xmath29 context @xcite .",
    "the fact that the continuum limit is non compact implies that the finite - size free energies , from which the critical exponents are extracted in the usual way , often contain strong logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "@xcite made an attempt of conjecturing the first few watermelon exponents based on direct diagonalisation of the transfer matrix for sizes up to @xmath36 loop strands .",
    "our present knowledge of the logarithmic corrections , combined with the ability to numerically solve the bethe ansatz equations for vastly larger sizes ( typically @xmath37 ) , obviously gives a much stronger handle on this problem .",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that a few of the conjectures presented in @xcite turn out to be wrong .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in section [ section : models ] we review the definition of the two coupled potts models and their equivalence with the two - colour dense loop model studied in @xcite .",
    "we then show how the latter can be reformulated in terms of a properly twisted @xmath38 model .",
    "the bethe ansatz study of the @xmath2 model is presented in section [ section : baea32 ] , allowing us to compute the conformal spectrum , which turns out to exhibit non compact features .",
    "these results are then applied to the calculation of the loop model s critical exponents in section [ section : confloop ] .",
    "we give general formulae for the watermelon exponents , some of which differ significantly from the numerical estimations of @xcite . our findings",
    "are summarised and discussed in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we wish to study a system of two coupled potts models described by the hamiltonian @xmath39 \\ , ,   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the set of nearest neighbour sites ( edges ) on the square lattice , and the kronecker symbol @xmath41 equals @xmath42 if @xmath43 , and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "the spins @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the first and second models take the values @xmath47 .",
    "[ the extension to two different models with @xmath48 and @xmath49 states is interesting , but does not to our knowledge sustain an integrable formulation . ]",

    "the proper values to give to the twist angles follows depend on @xmath181 . for each of @xmath182 we must choose them as follows :    * when @xmath183 there can exist non contractible loops of colour @xmath105 .",

    "even with the correct choice of twist angles , there is a subtle difference between the twisted vertex model and the periodic loop model .",
    "the reason for this is that the vertex model has a larger space of states .    to show this , we first focus on a single loop colour .",

    "there are obviously @xmath192 states .",
    "the difference is that the loop model gives the same weight @xmath31 to any loop , contractible or not , whereas the vertex model can control the weight of the non contractible loop independently by means of the twist angle . to endow the loop model with the capability of distinguishing between contractible and non contractible loops",

    "in fact , it is not difficult to establish a bijection between the state spaces . reading the states of the enlarged loop model from left to right ,",
    "replace each opening of an unmarked ( resp .",
    "a marked ) loop by an up - spin ( resp .",
    "a down - spin ) and each closing by a down - spin ( resp .",

    "the spin where the magnetisation becomes zero is linked by an arc to the initial spin .",
    "the corresponding spins are obviously opposite , and if the down - spin is to the left of the up - spin ( and only if we are in the @xmath199 sector ) the arc is marked . in the latter case , there is no corresponding spin and the initial spin is a through - line .",
    "it is an elementary exercise to show that in the original loop model the sector without through - lines has dimension @xmath200 in the enlarged loop model the sector with @xmath201 through - lines has dimension @xmath202 which is obvious because of the equivalence with the vertex model .",
    "the original loop model has the same dimensions in the sectors with through - lines , i.e. , @xmath203 for @xmath204 .",
    "the extension of these considerations to the two - colour loop model is obvious , since the two loop colours behave independently .",
    "in particular the total dimension in the sector with @xmath170 through - lines is the product of the dimensions for each of the colours : @xmath205",
    "having cleared up the relationship between the two - colour dense loop model of @xcite and the @xmath2 twisted vertex model , we now turn to the bethe ansatz study of the latter .",
    "the numerical study of the bethe ansatz equations allows us in particular to attain the eigenvalues in large finite size , and the close relationship with the @xmath30 model studied in @xcite will then permit us to infer the conformal spectrum in the continuum limit .",
    "our bethe ansatz study of the @xmath2 model is part of a broader study of the @xmath29 models , which we plan to develop in a future publication @xcite .",
    "each of these models comprises three regimes , denoted i , ii and iii , as already explained in the @xmath30 case in @xcite . in the @xmath2 case , and referring to the isotropic models @xmath206 given by ( [ lambdaisoriii])-([lambdaisori ] ) , these three regimes correspond to the following choice of the parameters :    * regime i corresponds to the isotropic point @xmath207 with @xmath208 $ ] .",

    "the first piece of evidence can be related to the two following observations :    * in the periodic ( untwisted ) case , the conformal exponents associated with each level show a very slow convergence with the size @xmath74 of the system . *",
    "turning on the twists @xmath176 and @xmath177 , we observe changes of regimes for these exponents , beyond which these are described by different analytical formulae and the convergence issues observed in the small - twist regime have disappeared .",

    "it is therefore very tempting to interpret the continuum limit of the @xmath2 model in regime iii as another non compact cft .",

    ", it is useful to recall some basic features of the black hole cft @xcite . it is written in terms of an action of two fluctuating fields @xmath212 and @xmath213 , on some target space with metric @xmath214 this target space is associated to a two - dimensional surface in three dimensions with the rough shape of a cigar , hence the familiar name ` cigar cft ' .",
    "more precisely , the target has rotational invariance around the @xmath146 axis , while the radius in the @xmath215 plane is given by @xmath216 , where @xmath217 denotes the geodesic distance from the origin .",

    "a consequence of these corrections was shown in @xcite to be that , on top of the continuum of normalisable states discussed above , the theory also admits _ discrete states _ which can be observed as an additional discrete set of conformal exponents popping out of the continuum beyond some particular value of the twist parameter , hence explaining the changes of regimes and the convergence improvements mentioned above .",
    "although the link between non compactness and discrete states was only worked out in details for the @xmath33 case , we wish to sketch here that it has a quite general origin related to the geometry of the target space , and hence could very probably generalise to other non compact cfts .",
    "this reproduces in a very evocative way the arguments of @xcite .",
    "the primary fields are labeled by three integers , namely the momentum @xmath31 and winding number @xmath230 around the compact direction of the cigar , as well as the momentum @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) in the non compact direction . although @xmath31 and @xmath230 are treated on the same footing by the cft , they lead to very different sigma model descriptions , as for instance non zero values of @xmath230 are not accounted for in the minisuperspace approach .",
    "to described non zero winding modes , one has to perform a duality transformation @xmath232 on the cigar target space , which is turned into a singular , trumpet - like geometry with metrics @xmath233 this singular new geometry allows for bound states , which are precisely the discrete states referred to above .    in conclusion ,",
    "the non compactness is closely linked to the existence of discrete states .",

    "the ground state in the loop model for large @xmath387 corresponds to a highly excited state in the vertex model .",
    "its analytic continuation to smaller @xmath80 undergoes a number of level crossings , and eventually becomes close to the ground state again for @xmath379 .",

    "a systematic comparison between the original and enlarged ( alias vertex ) models for small values of @xmath74 establishes the following relations :    * for @xmath130 large enough , the ground state of the loop model with @xmath390 legs coincides with the @xmath391 ground state of the vertex model with twist angles @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",
    "this observation brings along two remarks : 1 .",
    "the twist @xmath394 , instead of the expected @xmath395 , amounts to changing the sign of the weight @xmath396 of non contractible loops of colour 2 .",
    "suppose that the boundary conditions on the system are such that there is an even number @xmath397 of rows .",
    "then it can be shown @xcite that the number of non contractible loops in each potts model is even .",
    "it follows that the partition function ( or , more precisely , the modified partition function @xmath398 conditioned to supporting the given number of through - lines ) is invariant under the sign change .",
    "decomposing @xmath398 over the transfer matrix eigenvalues @xmath399 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) gives a ( weighted ) sum over terms of the type @xmath400 , implying that the change of @xmath177 only has the effect of changing the sign of a subset of the @xmath399 .",
    "this effect goes away upon changing to a formulation in which the transfer matrix adds two rows to the system , and hence does not alter the physics of the problem .",
    "we _ define _ the ground state of the twisted vertex model at a given twist to be the analytic continuation ( upon gradually increasing the twist ) of the state which has the lowest energy in the untwisted case .",
    "in other words , this is the state @xmath401 , with effective central charge @xmath402 , using the notation established above . because of the level crossings apparent in figure  [ fig : eigenvloopsl8s2460 ] , combined with the fact that the desired twist ( @xmath375 and @xmath393 ) depends on @xmath130 , it might very well be that for some values of @xmath130 the ground state of the twisted vertex model ( thus defined ) is not the lowest energy state .",
    "* for small @xmath130 , the ground state of the loop model corresponds to some excited state of the vertex model at twists @xmath392 , @xmath403 .",
    "since this excited state does not belong to the general set of excitations @xmath404 we studied so far , we choose to call it @xmath405 , and write the corresponding central charge @xmath406 .",
    "when @xmath407 is odd this state is actually a doublet of states , with respective momenta @xmath408 ( defined with respect to the one site translation operator in the untwisted case ) . from the point of view of bethe roots , the states in this doublet are anticonjugate to each other and we will need to consider only one of the two , say that of momentum @xmath409 , which we will still call @xmath405 .",
    "our work program is therefore the following : 1 ) understand the roots pattern corresponding to @xmath405 and find general conjectures for @xmath406 , and 2 ) then compare @xmath402 and @xmath410 , yielding the location of the crossover in the @xmath346 limit and the watermelons @xmath411 throughout the whole regime .",

    "what we did for all other states , namely determine the @xmath130 dependence of these central charges at zero twist angles , then turn to the @xmath414 dependence and possibly to different regimes .",

    "this implies that the states @xmath405 are part of a continuum for small values of the twist parameters , and therefore exhibit logarithmic terms ( shown by the @xmath318 notation in the first line ) of the same nature as those of ( [ eq : ciuntwisted ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to proceed to the last step of our program concerning the calculation of the exponents @xmath411 . a explained all through this section ,",

    "the same is true for the second line in ( [ eq : cgamma0 ] ) , for any value of @xmath130 in regime iii ( i.e. , @xmath428 ) .",
    "one easily sees that in the whole regime the former central charge is larger , as a matter of fact the two meet at @xmath429 .",

    "now for @xmath434 we can always use the first line in ( [ eq : cprimegamma0 ] ) , which is the one relevant for describing the twists @xmath435 .",
    "let us define a `` critical '' value of @xmath80 by @xmath436 there are then three regimes :    * @xmath437 : here @xmath438 is described by the first line of ( [ eq : cgamma0 ] ) , and is bigger than @xmath413 .",

    "our result for @xmath411 with @xmath445 can be compared with the numerical results given in table 1 of @xcite .",

    "going beyond this , we have exhibited an exact mapping of the lattice model to the @xmath2 vertex model @xcite in regime iii , which corresponds to the range @xmath446 in the parameterisation ( [ eq : loopweight ] ) .",
    "this mapping has allowed us in particular to extract the bethe ansatz equations ( see also @xcite ) . studying these numerically , and drawing on formal analogies with the @xmath30 model @xcite",

    "results on the coupled potts models  in their formulation as a dense two - colour loop model @xcite  then followed from identifying the twist angles that ensure the equivalence between the vertex model and the loop model in various sectors .",
    "for the ground state sector we recovered the central charge @xmath447 in agreement with @xcite . improving on this we have also given complete results for the magnetic exponents of the watermelon type , corresponding to imposing given numbers @xmath35 of propagating through - lines in each potts model .",
    "the watermelon exponents @xmath448 , in the case where both @xmath407 and @xmath449 are non zero , were found to be @xmath450 the exponents @xmath411 for @xmath451 ( or equivalently , @xmath452 with @xmath453 ) exhibit a delicate crossover when @xmath80 runs through the interval @xmath454 . aside from the particular case @xmath455 , we find for @xmath445 three different regimes : @xmath456 where @xmath457 is defined in ( [ defkc ] ) .",
    "the numerical study made in @xcite for the first few watermelon exponents was based on the numerical diagonalisation of the transfer matrix for sizes ranging up to @xmath36 .",
    "the strong logarithmic corrections , produced by the non compact nature of the continuum limit , were unfortunately unknown to the authors of @xcite and led them to numerical estimates ( and a couple of conjectures ) that  with the exception of @xmath299 and @xmath426 for which no logarithms are present  have been invalidated by the present work ( see section  [ fjcomp ] for a detailed comparison of the numerical analyses ) .    this might be a useful lesson for the future , since we now know at least three different loop models @xcite having a non compact continuum limit .    we should point out that it follows from an argument in @xcite that when @xmath458 ( i.e. , @xmath459 ) the two potts models decouple . more",
    "precisely , the free energies in the ground state sector for the dense two - colour loop model ( with @xmath460 ) and the decoupled models ( with @xmath461 ) are related by @xmath462 consequently the central charge ( [ c_again ] ) is @xmath463 .",
    "however , this does not imply that the spectrum of excitations at @xmath459 is also related to that of a single @xmath464-state potts model .",
    "in particular , the watermelon operators given above are manifestly completely different .",
    "moreover , we stress that the @xmath459 model will also have non compact excitations  a feature which is obviously absent in the @xmath464-state potts model .. however , the loop model underlying the @xmath11 state antiferromagnetic potts model @xcite has an excitation spectrum that is quite different from that of its ferromagnetic counterpart . ]",
    "we have left several directions for future work . for example",
    ", it would be interesting to compute also the energy - like critical exponents of the coupled potts models .",
    "another open issue is to study non - periodic boundary conditions , and to consider in particular boundary extensions of the underlying temperley - lieb algebra along the lines of @xcite . on the integrability side ,",
    "setting up the non - linear integral equations ( nlie ) might allow one to actually prove our formulae for the critical exponents and for the density of states .",
    "a field - theoretical formulation of the @xmath2 model will appear elsewhere in the more general @xmath29 setting @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that the dense two - colour loop model studied here has a dilute counterpart which is related to a truncated version of the plateau transition in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
