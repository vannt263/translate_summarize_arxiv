    "it is generally known that integer - order derivatives and integrals have clear physical and geometric interpretations , which significantly simplify their use for solving applied problems in various fields of science .    however , in case of fractional - order integration and differentiation , which represent a rapidly growing field both in theory and in applications to real - world problems , it is not so . since the appearance of the idea of differentiation and integration of arbitrary ( not necessary integer ) order there was not any acceptable geometric and physical interpretation of these operations for more than 300 years .",
    "the lack of these interpretations has been acknowledged at the first international conference on the fractional calculus in new haven ( usa ) in 1974 by including it in the list of open problems @xcite .",
    "the question was unanswered , and therefore repeated at the subsequent conferences at the university of strathclyde ( uk ) in 1984 @xcite and at the nihon university ( tokyo , japan ) in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the round - table discussion @xcite at the conference on transform methods and special functions in varna ( 1996 ) showed that the problem was still unsolved , and since that time the situation , in fact , still did not change .",
    "fractional integration and fractional differentiation are generalisations of notions of integer - order integration and differentiation , and include @xmath0-th derivatives and @xmath0-folded integrals ( @xmath0 denotes an integer number ) as particular cases .",
    "because of this , it would be ideal to have such physical and geometric interpretations of fractional - order operators , which will provide also a link to known classical interpretations of integer - order differentiation and integration .",
    "since the need for the aforementioned geometric and physical interpretations is generally recognised , several authors attempted to provide them .",
    "probably due mostly to linguistical reasons , much effort have been devoted to trying to relate _",
    "fractional _ integrals and derivatives , on one side , and _ fractal geometry _",
    ", on the other ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "however , it has been clearly shown by r.  rutman @xcite that this approach is inconsistent .",
    "besides those `` fractal - oriented '' attempts , some considerations regarding interpretation of fractional integration and fractional differentiation were presented in @xcite . however , those considerations are , in fact , only a small collection of selected examples of applications of fractional calculus , in which hereditary effects and self - similarity are typical for the objects modelled with the help of fractional calculus .",
    "although each particular problem , to which fractional derivatives or / and fractional integrals have been applied , can be considered as a certain illustration of their meaning , the paper @xcite can not be considered as a definite answer to the posed question .",
    "a different approach to geometric interpretation of fractional integration and fractional differentiation , based on the idea of the contact of @xmath1-th order , has been suggested by f.  ben adda @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to speak about an acceptable _ geometric interpretation _ if one can not see any picture there .    obviously , there is still a lack of geometric and physical interpretation of fractional integration and differentiation , which is comparable with the simple interpretations of their integer - order counterparts .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach to solution of this challenging old problem .",
    "we start with introducing a simple and really geometric interpretation of several types of fractional - order integration : the left - sided and the right - sided riemann  liouville fractional integration , the riesz potential , and the feller potential .    based on this , a physical interpretation of the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integration is proposed in terms of inhomogeneous and changing ( non - static , dynamic ) time scale . moreover , on this way we give a new physical interpretation of the stieltjes integral .",
    "we also try to persuade the readers that the suggested physical interpretation of fractional integration is in line with the current views on space  time in physics .",
    "we also suggest physical interpretation for the riemann - liouville fractional differentiation and for the caputo fractional differentiation .",
    "finally , we show that the suggested approach to geometric interpretation of fractional integration can be used for providing a new geometric and physical interpretation for convolution integrals of the volterra type .",
    "in this section we first give a geometric interpretation of left - sided and right - sided riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integrals , and then consider the riesz potential .",
    "let us consider the left - sided riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integral @xcite of order @xmath1 , @xmath2 and write it in the form @xmath3 @xmath4    the function @xmath5 has an interesting scaling property . indeed , if we take @xmath6 and @xmath7 , then @xmath8    now let us consider the integral ( [ fi - as - si ] ) for a fixed @xmath9 .",
    "then it becomes simply a stieltjes integral , and we can utilize g.  l.  bullock s idea @xcite .",
    "let us take the axes @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "in the plane @xmath13 we plot the function @xmath5 for @xmath14 . along the obtained curve",
    "we `` build a fence '' of the varying height @xmath15 , so the top edge of the `` fence '' is a three - dimensional line @xmath16 , @xmath14 .",

    "our `` fence '' throws two shadows on two walls .",
    "the first of them , that on the wall @xmath20 , is the well - known `` area under the curve @xmath15 '' , which is a standard geometric interpretation of the integral ( [ one - fold - integral ] ) .",

    "liouville fractional integration even from the geometric point of view .    what happens when @xmath9 is changing ( namely growing ) ?",
    "as @xmath9 changes , the `` fence '' changes simultaneously . its length and , in a certain sense , its shape changes . for illustration ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fencebas ] . if we follow the change of the `` shadow '' on the wall @xmath19 , which is changing simultaneously with the `` fence '' ( see fig.[fig : shadows ] ) , then we have a dynamical geometric interpretation of the fractional integral ( [ fi ] ) as a function of @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath24    then we can provide a geometric interpretation similar to the geometric interpretation of the left - sided riemann ",

    "liouville fractional integral ( [ right - fi ] ) and the classical integral with the moving lower limit : @xmath31        obviously , for @xmath21 both `` shadows '' are equal .",
    "therefore , we see that not only the left - sided , but also the right - sided riemann - liouville fractional integration includes the classical definite integration as a particular case even from the geometrical point of view .",
