    "in 1611 kepler conjectured that the most efficient packing of spheres is the face center cubic packing ( @xmath0 ) , with packing fraction @xmath1  @xcite . in 1831 , gauss provided a partial proof to this conjecture , and more recently hales presented a more complete proof  @xcite that is still being validated  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 packing is highly ordered , and in many cases random packings are of interest , as they are easy to create .",
    "for example , a large range of packing fractions have been found for granular particles with a minimum mechanically stable volume fraction @xmath2  @xcite , termed random loose packing .",
    "the maximum volume fraction for a randomly packed 3d system is @xmath3 , termed random close packing ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the earliest known experimental study on the density of @xmath4 was performed by bernal and mason  @xcite . in their experiment",
    "they repeatedly shook and compressed a rubber balloon full of spheres for sufficiently long enough time to reach a very dense state at @xmath5 .",
    "this result is sensitive to the preparation method , although the final volume fractions found are always close to 0.64 @xcite .",
    "computational studies are especially sensitive to protocol , with @xmath6 ranging between 0.64 and 0.68  @xcite",
    ". a broader range of mechanically stable packing fractions can be obtained by consider packings consisting of a polydisperse mixture of spheres or packings with non - spherical particles  @xcite . some theoretical progress explaining random close packing has occurred @xcite , although this is far from complete @xcite .",
    "all of these studies are relevant to a wide range of problems including the structure of living cells  @xcite , liquids  @xcite , granular media  @xcite , emulsions  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , and amorphous solids  @xcite .",
    "while all of the above studies focus on infinite systems , real systems have boundaries and often these boundaries are important . furthermore , in many cases samples are confined between closely spaced boundaries , with the confining size being only a few characteristic particle sizes across @xcite .",
    "for example , when a liquid is confined its structure is dramatically changed with particles forming layers near the wall , which ultimately affects the properties of the liquid  @xcite .",
    "the shearing of confined dense colloidal suspensions shows the emergence of new structures not seen before @xcite .",
    "the flow of granular media through hoppers  @xcite or suspensions through constricted micro- and nanofluidic devices  @xcite can jam and clog , costing time and money .",
    "some studies examined the packing of granular particles in narrow silos , focusing on stresses between particles and the walls @xcite .",
    "other studies noted that the particle packing in silos is layered near the walls @xcite .",
    "however , the influence of boundaries on @xmath6 has not been studied previously .",
    "we present computer simulated @xmath4 packings in confined geometries .",
    "in particular , we study binary mixtures to prevent wall - induced crystallization @xcite .",
    "we create two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) packings between two parallel walls , with periodic boundary conditions in the other directions .",
    "confinement significantly modifies the @xmath4 states , with lowered values for @xmath6 reflecting an inefficient packing near the walls .",
    "this inefficient packing persists several particle diameters away from the wall , although its dominant effects are only within 1 - 2 diameters",
    ".    these results will be useful for understanding many other confined systems .",
    "for example , many experiments study how confinement modifies the glass transition ; samples which have a well - characterized glass transition in large samples show markedly different properties when confined to small samples @xcite .",
    "however , it s not clear if these changes are due to boundaries or finite size effects @xcite .",
    "our results show that boundaries significantly modify the packing , which may in turn modify behavior of these confined molecular systems @xcite .",

    "section [ section : method ] outlines the algorithm we use to generate confined @xmath4 states .",

    "our aim is to quantify how a confining boundary alters the structure of randomly closed packed ( @xmath4 ) disks in 2d and spheres in 3d , and in particular to study how this depends on the narrowest dimension .",
    "this section presents our algorithm for 2d packings first , and then briefly discusses differences for the 3d algorithm .    in 2d , our system consists of a binary mixture of disks containing an equal number @xmath7 large disks of diameter @xmath8 and small disks of diameter @xmath9 with size ratio @xmath10 . for each configuration",

    "this method is briefly summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "infinitesimal particles are placed in the system , gradually expanded and moved at each step to prevent particles from overlapping .",
    "when a final state is found such that particles can no longer be expanded without necessitating overlap , the algorithm terminates . near the conclusion of the algorithm , we alternate between expansion and contraction steps to accurately determine the @xmath4 state .    in particular ,",
    "while the final state found is consistent with hard particles ( no overlaps allowed ) , the algorithm uses a soft potential at intermediate steps @xcite , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the center to center distance between two disk @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a characteristic energy scale ( @xmath20 for our simulations ) , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the heaviside function making @xmath23 nonzero for @xmath24 .",
    "simulations begin by randomly placing disks within a box of desired dimensions and boundary conditions with the initial diameters chosen such that @xmath25 . in the initial state particles do not overlap and the total energy @xmath26 .",
    "next all disk diameters are slowly expanded subject to the fixed size ratio @xmath27 and @xmath28 changing by @xmath29 per iteration ; we start with @xmath30 . after each expansion step , we check if any disks overlap , by checking the condition @xmath31 for each particle pair . below this limit , we assume the overlap is negligible .",
    "if any particles do overlap ( @xmath32 ) , we use the non - linear conjugate gradient method  @xcite to decrease the total energy by adjusting the position of disks so they no longer overlap ( @xmath26 ) . in practice ,",
    "one energy minimization step does not guarantee we have reached a minimum within the desired numerical precision .",
    "thus this step can be repeated to further reduce the energy if @xmath33 .",
    "we judge that we have reached a nonzero local minimum if the condition @xmath34 is found , where @xmath35 is the magnitude of the gradient of @xmath36 . physically speaking",
    "this is the average force per particle , and the threshold value ( @xmath37 ) leads to consistent results .",
    "if we have such a state with @xmath32 , this is not an @xmath4 state as particles overlap .",
    "thus we switch and now slowly contract the particles until we find a state where particles again no longer overlap ( within the allowed tolerance ) . at that point",
    ", we once again begin expansion .",
    "each time we switch between expansion and contraction , we decrease @xmath29 by a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , these alternating cycles allow us to find an @xmath4 state of non - overlapping particles ( within the specified tolerance ) and determine @xmath6 to high accuracy .",
    "we terminate our algorithm when @xmath38 . in practice",
    ", we have tested a variety of values for the thresholds @xmath39 and @xmath40 and find that our values guarantee reproducible results as well as reasonably fast computations .",
    "our algorithm gave an average packing fraction of @xmath41 for 40 simulated @xmath4 states containing 10,000 particles with periodic boundary conditions along both directions .",

    "additionally , we wish to generate packings with pre - specified values for the final confining height @xmath45 .",
    "( this allows us to create multiple @xmath4 configurations with the same @xmath46 . )",
    "we impose @xmath46 by affinely scaling the system after each step , so that the upper boundary is adjusted by @xmath47 and each disk s @xmath14-coordinate is multiplied by the ratio @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the confining widths between two consecutive iterations .",

    "overall , it is not known if this algorithm produces mathematically rigorously defined random close packed states @xcite . however , the goal of this article is to determine empirically the properties of close - packed states in confinement , and we are not attempting to extract mathematically rigorous results .",

    "this supports our interpretation , that confinement modifies the structure near the walls but not in the interior .",
    "furthermore , the rapidity of the decay to the plateau seen in fig .  [ fig:2dsinglehistplot ] suggests that confinement is only a slight perturbation to systems with overall size @xmath83 .",

    "likewise , the large particle density ( dashed line ) has its initial peak at @xmath86 , indicating that those particles are also in contact with the wall .",

    "given that the first layer of particles always packs against the wall , this imposes a further constraint on how particles pack in the nearby vicinity .",
    "the consistency in the location and width of the second layer for all @xmath46 demonstrates that the constraint of the first layer always produces a similar packing in the second layer , essentially independent of @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig:2dhistpic ] , the vertical dark lines show the layering of particles induced by the left boundary and the angled dark lines show the layering of particles induced by the right boundary .",
    "we see that for small @xmath46 these sets of lines overlap and intersect , meaning that there is a strong influence from one boundary on the packing within the layers produced by the other boundary .",
