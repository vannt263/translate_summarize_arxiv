    "<S> how is cp violation of low energy related to cp violation required from baryon number asymmetry ? </S>",
    "<S> we give an example which shows a direct link between cp violation of neutrino oscillation and baryogenesis through leptogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> when the sphaleron process is active , the sum of baryon number and lepton number is not a conserved quantity ; @xmath0 anomaly @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the evolution equation of baryon number and lepton number becomes a coupled equation . </S>",
    "<S> the present baryon number can be written in terms of the `` initial '' lepton number and baryon number as ; b_now=(b - l)_ini.+ ( b+l)_ini . </S>",
    "<S> ( b - l)_ini .. fukugita and yanagida proposed `` baryogenesis without grand unification '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath2 while the lepton number production is possible because their model includes the heavy majorana neutrinos and their decays lead to the lepton number asymmetry ; l_ini ~- . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of my talk is give a specific example which shows `` a direct link '' between the size and sign of baryon number and cp violation in neutrino oscillatio ; p ( _ _ e)-p(| _ |_e ) ~j = i m ( k_e1 k_e2^)(k_1 k_2^)^ , [ j ] where @xmath3 is mns matrix . </S>",
    "<S> |l_l _ k _ l. @xmath4 is related to mns matrix . by taking the basis in which the mass matrix for the heavy majorana neutrinos and charged leptons are real diagonal </S>",
    "<S> , the mns matrix can be obtained through the diagonalization of @xmath5 on the other hand the lepton number asymmetry in the same basis is given as ; _ 1 & = & = - , where @xmath6 ( tev ) and we take @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider `` the minimal seesaw '' which generates @xmath8 and @xmath9 simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal model is @xmath10 model @xmath11 3 light neutrinos @xmath12 and 2 heavy majorana neutrionos @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> the important properties of the model are one light neutrino is exactly massless : @xmath21=0 $ ] and there are three cp violating phases since there are @xmath22 imaginary elements in @xmath23 . by writing @xmath18 as follows ; v_r&= & (    cc c_r & s_r + -s_r & c_r    ) (    cc ( -i ) & 0 + 0 & ( i )    ) , we can show the leptogenesis is determined by a cp phase @xmath24 , _ 1 & & ~- im[(m_d^ m_d)_12 ^ 2 ] + & & ~-(m_3 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)^2 s_r^2 c_r^2 . on the other hand , cp violation in neutrino oscillation , @xmath25 in eq.([j ] ) , depends on all three cp violating phases because @xmath3 is determined by the diagonalization as @xmath26 and it is sensitive to all cp phases in @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we give an example for the model in which j is determined by leptogenesis phase @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath27 is a real orthogonal matrix @xcite as @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> mns matrix @xmath3 has the following form ; k= o_23 o_12 (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & & + 0 & & +    ) p , where @xmath29 is a diagonal phase matrix which is not relevant for @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 and @xmath31 are determined through the diagonalization of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath30 and @xmath31 do not depend on @xmath17 at all . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on @xmath33 besides @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> those four quantities can be determined from the heavy majorana decay width , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and two light neutrino masses scales @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath40 , @xmath41 , we have ; & & k= (    ccc & & + - & & + & - & +    ) p. it is easy to see @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we can show there is a correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath24 vanishes , @xmath43 becomes a real symmetric matrix . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath31 must vanish in the limit . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath24 does not vanish , the sign of @xmath24 determines the sign of lepton number asymmetry which in turn determines the excess of matter ( anti - matter ) . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath25 reflects the sign of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we found the following correlation holds . </S>",

    "<S> , we show the correlation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , by identifying the two light neutrino masses as @xmath47 ev and @xmath48(lma ) . </S>",

    "<S> however , if we measure @xmath25 only , we can not distinguish the phase for the leptogenesis ( @xmath31 ) from the other phases in @xmath17 because only a certain combination of them appear . </S>",
    "<S> the isolation must be done using some other quantities , double @xmath53 decay etc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> *   we show the correlation between cp violating phase for leptogenesis and cp violating phase for neutrino oscillation for a specific choice of @xmath17 . </S>"
