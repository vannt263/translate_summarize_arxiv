    "<S> we find that the statistics of levels undergoing metal - insulator transition in systems with multi - parametric gaussian disorders behaves in a way similar to that of the single parametric brownian ensembles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter appear during a poisson @xmath0 wigner - dyson transition , driven by a random perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy provides the analytical evidence for the single parameter scaling behaviour in disordered systems as well as a tool to obtain the level - correlations at the critical point for a wide range of disorders .    .    2    </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the eigenfunctions can significantly affect the statistical behaviour of energy levels of a disordered system and thereby related physical properties e.g transport . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of disorder may cause localized waves in the system , implying lack of interaction between certain parts . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the structure of the hamiltonian matrix which is sparse or banded in the site representation depending on the dimensionality of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the disorder - strength can lead to a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , with eigenfuctions changing from a fully extended state ( metal ) to a strongly localized one ( insulator ) with partial localization in the critical region . </S>",
    "<S> the associated hamiltonian also undergoes a transition from a full matrix to a sparse or banded form and finally to a diagonal matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical studies of levels for various types of disorders require , therefore , analysis of different ensembles . here </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the localization and its strength is reflected in the measure and the sparcity of the ensemble , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our objective in this paper is to obtain a mathematical formulation for the level - correlations , common to a large class of disorders ( gaussian type ) ; the information about the nature of disorder enters in the formulation through a parameter , basically a function of various parameters influencing the localization .    </S>",
    "<S> recently it was shown that the eigenvalue distributions of various ensembles , with a gaussian measure , appear as non - equilibrium stages of a brownian type diffusion process @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues evolve with respect to a parameter related to the complexity of the system represented by the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the diffusion equation for a given value of the parameter gives , therefore , the distribution of the eigenvalues , and thereby their correlations , for the corresponding system . </S>",
    "<S> the present study uses the technique to analyze the spectral properties of the levels undergoing mit in various disordered systems .    the anderson model for a disordered system </S>",
    "<S> is described by a d - dimensional disordered lattice , of size @xmath1 , with a hamiltonian @xmath2 in tight - binding approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the site energies @xmath3 , measured in units of the overlap integral between adjacent sites , correspond to the random potential . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping is assumed to connect only the @xmath4 nearest - neighbors ( referred by @xmath5 ) of each site . in the site representation </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 turns out to be a sparse matrix of size @xmath7 with diagonal matrix elements @xmath8 and off - diagonals @xmath9 describing the hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the level - statistics can therefore be studied by analyzing the properties of an ensemble of ( i ) sparse real symmetric matrices , in presence of a time - reversal symmetry and ( ii ) sparse complex hermitian matrices in absence of a time - reversal .    </S>",
    "<S> the mit can be brought about by a competitive variation of the disorder and hopping rate which can be mimicked by a change of the distribution parameters of the ensemble measure @xmath10 . in this paper , we consider the case in which the site - energies @xmath11 are independent gaussian distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping can be chosen to be non - random or random ( gaussian ) . </S>",

    "<S> the strongly insulated state corresponds to all @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( all @xmath27 ) , implying no overlap between site states . </S>",
    "<S> the metal , with almost similar overlap between various site states , can be modeled by eq.(1 ) with all @xmath28 , that is , a wigner dyson ( wd ) ensemble @xcite .    the eigenvalue distribution for a metal is given by the wd distribution , and , for an insulator by a poisson distribution @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath46 is an arbitray parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution reaches a steady state when @xmath47 ; @xmath48 in this limit is given by a wd distribution , @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral correlations for mit can now be obtained by using following analogy . </S>",
    "<S> the eq.(3 ) is same as the equation governing an evolution of the distribution @xmath43 of the eigenvalues , of a hamiltonian @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , from an initial state @xmath53 to wd ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the transition , referred as wdt later on , is caused by a random perturbation @xmath54 , taken from a wd ensemble ( of variance @xmath46 ) , and of strength @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; the elements @xmath9 are thus gaussian distributed with a variance @xmath56 , @xmath57 and same mean for all of them . the transition ( wdt ) to equilibrium , with @xmath58 as the evolution parameter , is rapid , discontinuous for infinite dimensions of matrices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but for small-@xmath35 and large @xmath59 , a smooth crossover can be seen in terms of a rescaled parameter @xmath60 , with @xmath61 as the mean - level spacing in the correlated region of the spectrum at @xmath58 , @xmath62 as the correlated `` volume '' and @xmath63 as the mean level spacing of the whole spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate states , corresponding to finite , non - zero @xmath64-values , during the crossover are known as brownian ensembles ( be ) @xcite or rosenzweig - porter ensembles ( rpe ) @xcite . the similar evolution equations of @xmath43 for mit and wdt , imply a similarity in their eigenvalues distributions for all @xmath35-values and thereby correlations for all @xmath64-values , under similar initial conditions ( that is , @xmath65 same for both the cases although @xmath66 may be different ) . in finite disordered systems , therefore , a continuous family of intermediate statistics exists between metal and insulator which can be described by the be for the corresponding @xmath64-value , occuring during poisson @xmath0 wd ensemble type wdt .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the mean level spacing @xmath67 and the correlation volume @xmath62 divide the level - statistics for the large be ( @xmath68 ) into three regions @xcite :    \\(i ) * @xmath69 * : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , giving @xmath72 and poisson statistics ,    \\(ii ) * @xmath73 * : @xmath74 and @xmath75 giving @xmath76 and wd statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> ( iii)*@xmath77 , with @xmath78 as an arbitrary constant with respect to @xmath59 * : although @xmath67 still behaves as @xmath79 , but now @xmath80 thus giving @xmath81 ( referred as @xmath82 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath83 therefore corresponds to a third statistics , intermediate between poisson and wd ensemble and is known as the critical brownian ensemble ( cbe ) . </S>",
    "<S> this being the case for arbitrary values of @xmath78 , an infinite family of cbe occur during wdt . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such a family can be seen from any of the fluctuation measures for wdt . </S>",
    "<S> one traditionaly used meausure in this regard is relative behaviour of the tail of nearest - neighbour spacing distribution @xmath84 , defined as @xmath85 with @xmath86 as any one of the crossing points of @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( here subscript @xmath89 and @xmath90 refer to the wd case and poisson case respectively ) . in the limit @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for wde and poisson </S>",
    "<S> limit respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fig.1 shows the numerically obtained behaviour of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 ( for @xmath96 ) , with @xmath97 corresponding to one of the cbes . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of all the points on two branches for different @xmath59-values confirms the existence of a cbe at @xmath97 with a critical exponent @xmath98 ( as @xmath99 near @xmath97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59-independence of @xmath100 also indicates the possibility of infinitely many @xmath97 ( and its arbitrarity ) and therefore an infinite family of cbes .    for disordered systems with infinite system size @xmath1 , the states are critical near a particular disorder @xmath101 ( or energy ) , termed as critical point , with a correlation length @xmath102 , @xmath103 as the critical exponent . at the critical point , @xmath104 and the critical value of the parameter @xmath64 ( referred as @xmath105 ) depends on the dimensionality ; @xmath106 , with both @xmath35 and @xmath107 dimensionality - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> a knowledge of @xmath105 can then be used to map the critical level statistics at mit for various dimensions @xmath108 to the infinite family of critical brownian ensembles ( cbe ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the appropriate cbe corresponding to the critical anderson hamiltonian ( cah ) requires @xmath109 , and , thus a prior knowledge of @xmath64-value associated with cah . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here one example ( this case is also used in our numerical analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider an anderson system with the gaussian disorder , same for each site , and random or non - random hopping between nearest neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ensemble measure can be described by eq.(1 ) with @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 pairs representing hopping , @xmath24 and @xmath115 for all @xmath114 values corresponding to dissconnected sites . </S>",
    "<S> this gives , by using eq.(2 ) , @xmath116 with @xmath117 as the number of the connected sites ( nearest - neighbours ) which depends on the topology and the dimensionality @xmath118 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> analogous to wdt , a rescaling of @xmath58 would give the parameter for smooth transition : @xmath119 with @xmath120 at @xmath121 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 behaves as @xmath122 ( as @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 with @xmath125 as the localization length which depends on disorder @xmath126 and can be determined by using wavefunction statistics ( e.g. inverse participation ratio ) . </S>",
    "<S> as disorder decreases , the @xmath127 increases resulting in a smooth increase in @xmath64 in finite systems , and , thereby the statistics intermediate between poisson and wde . </S>",
    "<S> however for infinite system sizes , @xmath72 and the statistics is poisson as long as @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> but at a certain disorder strength , @xmath129 , which makes @xmath64 size - independent thus giving its critical value @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> the level statistics of the system at this disorder strength is given by the cbe with the same @xmath64-value and is critical due to ( i ) being different from both poisson and wd behaviour , ( ii ) its invariance as @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> now for a further decrease in disorder , @xmath131 , as a result @xmath76 , and the system has a wd statistics . </S>",
    "<S> however , for an infinitely long one dimensional lattice with @xmath4 nearest neghbours , the statistics always remains poission irrespective of disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath132 giving @xmath133 for @xmath134 unless there is a very long range connectivity in the lattice ( i.e @xmath135 ) . however </S>",
    "<S> a crossover from poisson to wd ensemble can be seen for finite @xmath1 by varying the ratio @xmath136 .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 will be a function of coordination number , disorder strength , hopping rate and dimensionality of the lattice as well as the level - density of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions/ topologies , leading to different sparcity and coordination numbers , may therefore result in different critical level statistics even if degree of disorder , hopping rate and dimensionality is same ; this is in agreement with numerical observations @xcite and analytical study for 2d systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly different dimensions , can lead to diffenent local level - densities and thereby different critical points @xmath137 .    </S>",
    "<S> many results for the spectral fluctuations of the wdt with poisson ensemble as an initial state are already known @xcite and can directly be used for the corresponding measures for the mit in different disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider the 2-level density correlator @xmath138 ; @xmath139 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath140 is the density of eigenvalues and @xmath141 implying the ensemble average . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath142 for the anderson transition in presence of a magnetic field , can therefore be given by the @xmath142 for wdt between poisson @xmath0 gue ensemble @xcite ; @xmath143 where @xmath144 with @xmath145 , @xmath146 $ ] , @xmath147 $ ] , @xmath148 and @xmath149 as the @xmath150 bessel function . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath151 and @xmath152 corresponding to metal and insulator regime respectively . a substitution of @xmath153 in eq.(4 ) </S>",
    "<S> will thus give the @xmath142 for the cah . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution @xmath84 for the mit can be given by using the one for the be during poisson @xmath0 gue transition @xcite : @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> further the good agreement of the numerically obtained @xmath84 for the cah without time - reversal symmetry with that of a cbe ( with same @xmath64-value ) reconfirms our analytical result ; the fig.2(a , b ) show the behaviour of the cah in presence of a random hopping ( cah - i with @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and , thereby @xmath158 ) and a non - random hopping ( cah - ii with @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , thus @xmath162 ) , respectively along with their cbe analogs ( @xmath78 determined by the relation @xmath163 ) ; see @xcite for the details on the numerics .    </S>",
    "<S> an important characterstic of critical level statistics is the level compressibility @xmath164 , @xmath165 ; @xmath166 in the metallic and the insulator phase , respectively , and takes an intermediate value at the hybrid phase near the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the eq.(4 ) can be used to obtain @xmath167 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the critical region , with its finite @xmath64 value ( @xmath168 ) , will thus have a level compressibility different from both metal and insulator regimes ; a @xmath169 value is supposed to be an indicator of the multifractal nature of the eigenvectors .    the compressibility of the spectrum can also be seen from the `` number variance '' @xmath170 which describes the variance in the number of levels in an interval of @xmath171 mean level spacings . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath172 , basically a measure of the `` spectral rigidity '' is related to the compressibility : @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> the fig.3 shows the numerical behaviour for the @xmath174 for the cah - i and cah - ii along with their cbe analogs ; the good agreement in each case re - verifies our claim about the similarity between the mit and wdt . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore fig.3 . also shows the fractional behaviour of @xmath164 for cbe , which is in agreement with the @xmath164-form given in the preceeding paragraph .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical measures for the anderson transition in presence of a time - reversal symmetry can similarly be obtained by using their equivalence to wdt from poisson @xmath0 goe ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> however due to the technical difficulties @xcite ) , only some approximate results are known for the latter case . for example , the @xmath142 for small-@xmath171 can be given as @xmath175 with @xmath176 as the bessel function ( obtained by solving eq.(17 ) of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for large-@xmath171 behaviour , @xmath142 can be shown to satisfy the relation ( see eq.(21 ) of @xcite ) @xmath177 . by taking @xmath15 and @xmath178 ( goe limit ) </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath179 for the transition in presence of a trs can be obtained ; @xmath180 . the lack of the knowledge of @xmath179 for entire energy - range handicaps us in providing an exact form of @xmath164 . </S>",
    "<S> however the @xmath84 for this case can be given by using the one for a be ( rpe ) during poisson @xmath0goe transition @xcite : @xmath181 , with @xmath182 as the bessel function .    in the end </S>",
    "<S> , a comparison of our results with some of the past studies is crucial . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a fractional compressibility in an ensemble essentially same as cbe and its possibility as a model for cah was also suggested in @xcite which was later on contradicted in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the claim in @xcite is disproved by our numerical studies of both the transitions , showing similar behaviour for compressibility , besides other fluctuation measures at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical work therefore reaffirms our claim based on the exact analytical work : ( i ) the level - statistics for mit in disordered systems with a gaussian disorder can be described by the same for wdt with a poisson initial condition , ( ii ) the level - statistics in the disordered systems is indeed governed by a single scaling parameter .    </S>",
