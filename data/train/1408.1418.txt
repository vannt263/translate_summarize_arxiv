    "fe@xmath0te chalcogenides are the parent compounds of the simplest family of iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite both the electronic and magnetic properties of fe@xmath0te compounds show strong sensitivity to the amount of non - stoichiometric fe ions . for small values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the low - temperature crystal structure is monoclinic ( @xmath4 ) , and the magnetic order is described by the commensurate propagation vector @xmath5 , corresponding to a double - stripe pattern .",
    "this is remarkably different from feas - based parent compounds , which display an antiferromagnetic order described by @xmath6 or @xmath7 , corresponding to single - stripe patterns , and a crystal structure with orthorhombic symmetry ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that by increasing the amount of interstitial fe , the magnetic structure of fe@xmath0te becomes an incommensurate spiral .",
    "the incommensurate ordering manifests itself as a shift in the elastic neutron scattering peak with respect to the @xmath5 positions . according to neutron scattering experiments,@xcite in the range of @xmath9",
    "the shift is approximately along the diagonal directions @xmath10 or @xmath11 ; however , @xmath12 does not vary smoothly with @xmath3 .",
    "there have been several theoretical attempts to understand the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0te compounds within the localized spin scenario , @xcite since these materials are known to be more strongly correlated than their arsenide counterparts .",
    "@xcite although the magnetic order at both low and at high levels of fe excess can be successfully described by a @xmath13 super - exchange model , it is clear that the local picture alone can not describe the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0te , as it requires @xmath3-dependent exchange couplings .",
    "alternatively , this property indicates that itinerant electrons are also important to describe the magnetism of these materials , suggesting that hybrid models with coupled localized - itinerant moments are a suitable starting point .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we argue that the evolution of the magnetic interactions due to @xmath3-dependent charge doping is the key to understand the experimentally observed magnetic phase diagram of fe@xmath0te . our study is based on the assumption that , in these particular iron chalcogenides , some of the fe orbitals are almost localized while the other orbitals remain itinerant .",
    "this idea is supported by recent dynamical mean - field theory studies of fete systems  @xcite showing that the hund s coupling can promote an orbital - selective localization already in the paramagnetic phase.@xcite here , we demonstrate that the change in magnetic properties observed in the fe@xmath0te compounds can be reasonably well captured by an effective model in which localized spins acquire a long - range rkky - type interaction ,  @xcite in addition to the @xmath13 heisenberg super - exchange@xcite and biquadratic couplings .",
    "@xcite we note that in refs.@xcite the biquadratic term was calculated on a purely electronic basis , and obtained model gave a good agreement with experimentally measured spin - wave spectrum in several fe - based materials .",
    "another possible origin of the biquadratic terms is due to the magnetoelastic coupling.@xcite    the former , mediated by the multi - orbital spin susceptibility of the itinerant electrons , is sensitive to the addition of excess fe @xmath3 , rendering the magnetic ground state of the local spins change as a function of @xmath3 . in particular , we find that the shift in the chemical potential promoted by the excess electrons changes the fermi surface in a way that suppresses the @xmath2 peaks of the itinerant spin susceptibility of the parent compound , promoting at the same time peaks at small - momentum values . as a result ,",
    "the effective exchange interaction @xmath14 is suppressed , @xmath15 is enhanced , and @xmath16 changes sign , favoring a spiral incommensurate state , in contrast to the double - stripe state of the stoichiometric compound .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present an effective super - exchange model describing localized magnetic moments in the multi - band correlated electron sea and argue that this is a suitable minimal microscopic model to describe the magnetism of fe@xmath0te compounds . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the evolution of the fermi surface of fete@xmath0 with increasing level of the fe excess using the tight - binding model ( tbm ) originally proposed by ma _",
    "_ et al__@xcite , which had been later also used by wang _ _ et al__@xcite to explain further resutls in fete@xmath0 .",
    "we show that while the fermi surface at small @xmath3 has both small hole pockets at the @xmath17- and @xmath18-points and elliptical electron pockets at the @xmath19- and @xmath20-points , at large @xmath3 all pockets are electron - like . in sec .",
    "iv , we study spin fluctuations in the correlated multi - band electron system and compute the pauli susceptibility within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we find that at small @xmath3 the itinerant spin susceptibility peaks at @xmath21 and @xmath22 due to the weak nesting between the hole and the electron pockets connected by these momenta .",
    "the @xmath3-dependent charge doping suppresses the @xmath21 and @xmath22 peaks , but it leads to an increase of the spin fluctuation in the central part of the brillouin zone . in sec .",
    "v , we compute the rkky interactions . we first perform a qualitative computation of the rkky interactions using a simple phenomenological model , and then perform a quantitative analysis based on the realistic rpa susceptibility obtained in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "vi , the classical phase diagram of the effective spin model is presented . in agreement with experimental findings",
    ", the computed phase diagram displays a transition , above a certain level of fe excess , from a commensurate double - stripe phase , characterized by the wave - vectors @xmath23 or @xmath24 , to an incommensurate spiral ( ic ) phase characterized by the wave - vector @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude with a summary in sec .",
    "the paper has two appendices .",
    "appendix a contains the derivation of the biquadratic exchange couplings arising from the magneto - elastic coupling .",
    "appendix b provides the explicit expression of the classical energy of the effective super - exchange model describing fete@xmath0 .",
    "to capture the fact that in fe@xmath0te correlations lead to different levels of itineracy in distinct fe orbitals ,  @xcite we consider a semi - phenomenological `` hybrid '' model containing both localized and itinerant moments  similar in spirit to the models of refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , we assume that the electrons occupying the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals form local moments with @xmath28 due to the hund s coupling .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 electrons have itinerant character and can be controlled by the concentration of excess fe as @xmath3 increases .",
    "a full derivation of such an effective model from the microscopic hamiltonian is an intricate problem beyond the scope of this work .    in most of the paper ,",
    "we assume that each excess fe atom contributes eight electrons ,  @xcite but our main conclusions do not change if one considers that less electrons are introduced by each fe.@xcite to account for the changes in the fermi surface promoted by these excess fe atoms , we employ a rigid band approximation in which the doping of excess electrons shifts the chemical potential from @xmath30 to positive values .",
    "thus , the microscopic hamiltonian we use is an effective double - exchange model describing localized magnetic moments in the multi - band correlated electron sea , which can be written as @xmath31    the first term describes the interacting itinerant electrons : @xmath32    the non - interacting part @xmath33 is based on the five - orbital tbm @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the creation operator for an electron of momentum @xmath36 with spin @xmath37 in the orbital @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the tight - binding matrix elements . here",
    ", we are interested only in the contribution coming from the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 orbitals , as explained above . since the other orbitals do not contribute to the fermi surface , the static spin susceptibility , which will give rise to the rkky interactions , is very similar regardless of whether we consider a projected three - orbital model or the actual five - orbital tight - binding model .",
    "the interaction part consists of four terms:@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion , @xmath45 is the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion , @xmath46 is the hund s coupling , and @xmath47 is the pair - hopping term .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 to ensure the invariance of the hamiltonian under rotations in orbital space",
    ".    the second term in eq.([ham1 ] ) describes the interaction between the localized spins : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath15 are super - exchange couplings between first- , second- , and third - nearest neighbors . in this work ,",
    "we use the values of @xmath51 , and @xmath15 obtained from the first - principles electronic - structure calculations .",
    "@xcite @xmath52 denote generalized non - heisenberg exchange couplings between first and second neighbors and ring - exchange .",
    "these couplings are predominantly determined by the magneto - elastic coupling , and their derivations are shown in appendix a. in particular , here we consider the first- and second - neighbors biquadratic couplings @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as well as a `` diagonal '' ring - exchange @xmath55 .",
    "the third term @xmath56 describes the coupling between the localized spins , @xmath57 , and the itinerant electrons @xmath58 . here , @xmath57 are the localized spins of electrons on orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath59 are the spins of itinerant electrons on orbitals @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the pauli matrices and @xmath63 is the number of lattice sites . for our investigations ,",
    "the sign of @xmath46 is not important , as shown in the following . due to the interaction described by eq.([hamjh ] ) , the itinerant electrons mediate additional exchange couplings between the localized moments : @xmath64    the couplings @xmath65 between localized spins on lattice sites @xmath66 and @xmath67 , known as rkky interactions , can be obtained by integrating out the itinerant degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , @xmath65 are determined by the static spin susceptibility @xmath68 of the multi - band conduction electron sea : @xmath69    taking into account both heisenberg and rkky interactions , the effective low - energy hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath70 where , for convenience , we defined @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath219 interactions are small almost for almost all values of @xmath3 , except @xmath211 at interstitial concentrations @xmath220 . however , as fe@xmath0te crystals have not been yet grown with @xmath220 , we will not discuss the possible effects of this term .    for small but physical values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the largest interactions are @xmath203 and @xmath204 , whereas for intermediate and larger values of @xmath3 , @xmath218 dominates .",
    "because of this , and since in our bare local model ( [ hamloc ] ) only @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 have non - zero values , hereafter we neglect the rkky contributions beyond third - nearest neighbors .    much of the behavior of the rkky interactions for small values of @xmath3 can be understood within the toy model discussed in the previous section .",
    "as expected , we obtain large antiferromagnetic @xmath203 and ferromagnetic @xmath204 interactions in the regime where the susceptibility @xmath186 has strong peaks near the @xmath21 and @xmath22 points ( @xmath221 , see fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ) .",
    "as these peaks are suppressed , the absolute values of both interaction parameters are reduced , in agreement with decreasing @xmath197 in fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "at the same time , the small antiferromagnetic @xmath218 interaction remains nearly unchanged , reflecting the fact that it is unaffected by the fluctuations near @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , fluctuations in broader regions of the brillouin zone , such as in the vicinities of the @xmath18 and the @xmath17 points , yield the leading contributions to the @xmath218 interaction .    by increasing the concentration of interstitial fe atoms beyond @xmath222 ,",
    "the @xmath218 interaction becomes the dominant one , as the large peaks of the itinerant susceptibility @xmath186 near @xmath21 and @xmath22 quickly disappear , rendering @xmath203 and @xmath204 small .",
    "however , for @xmath223 , the antiferromagnetic @xmath218 interaction starts being suppressed , and eventually changes sign and becomes ferromagnetic for @xmath224 .",
    "comparison to the behavior of the rpa susceptibility in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) reveals that this change can be attributed to the reduction of the broad fluctuations present around the @xmath18 point , followed by the subsequent enhancement of fluctuations near the @xmath17 point .",
    "indeed , according to the form factor of @xmath218 in eq .",
    "( [ rkky_toy ] ) , fluctuations around @xmath225 yield an antiferromagnetic @xmath218 , whereas fluctuations around @xmath226 yield a ferromagnetic @xmath218 .      having calculated @xmath65 as function of the fe excess concentration , it is now straightforward to compute the @xmath3-dependent effective couplings @xmath213 between the localized moments in eq .",
    "( [ exchange - model ] ) , whose solution determines the magnetic ground state . to this end",
    ", we first need to establish the bare heisenberg exchange couplings @xmath227 , which do not change with increasing fe excess .",
    "the values of the effective couplings @xmath213 at @xmath228 were computed via first - principles electronic structure calculations by ma _",
    "et al_.@xcite up to the third neighbors , these values normalized on the value of spin @xmath229 are equal to @xmath2302.1 mev/@xmath217 , @xmath23115.8 mev/@xmath217 , @xmath23210.1 mev/@xmath217 . because even for @xmath228 , fe@xmath0te has both itinerant and localized electrons , these effective couplings contain both the @xmath65 interactions and the bare heisenberg exchange couplings @xmath227 .",
    "in order to decompose these contributions , we simply subtract the rkky interactions computed by us at @xmath145 from the values of the super - exchange interactions derived by ma _",
    "et al_.  @xcite this procedure yields the bare heisenberg exchange couplings @xmath233 mev/@xmath217 , @xmath234 mev/@xmath217 , and @xmath235 mev/@xmath217 .    in fig .",
    "6 ( b ) , we plot @xmath236 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the effective couplings @xmath237 and @xmath238 remain antiferromagnetic for all @xmath3 , while @xmath239 changes sign at @xmath240 . as we will show in the next section ,",
    "this change in @xmath239 is the driving force behind the change in the magnetic order that happens in fe@xmath0te above a critical concentration of fe excess .",
    "with the @xmath3-dependent exchange constants shown in fig . 6 ( b ) , we now proceed to the solution of the effective super - exchange model ( [ exchange - model ] ) . we compute the classical phase diagram by numerical minimization of its classical energy with the constraint that all spins have unit length .",
    "our findings are summarized in the classical phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "7 . to look for a wide variety of states ,",
    "we introduce four sublattices , labeled as 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ( see fig . 8) and perform full minimization of the classical energy .",
    "to each sublattice we associate a local frame given by angles @xmath241 .",
    "we define the global reference frame by setting @xmath242 .",
    "in addition , we consider only spin configurations which can be characterized by a single-@xmath243 spiral , such that after a translation from site to site in the same sublattice , the magnetic moment rotates by an angle @xmath244 , where @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 are integers , @xmath248 is the lattice vector .",
    "then , the general expression for the on - site magnetization is given by @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the sublattice index",
    ". substituting @xmath251 into eq.([exchange - model ] ) yields the classical energy @xmath252 .",
    "the explicit expression for the classical energy is rather cumbersome and , for convenience , is given in appendix b. we minimize @xmath253 numerically and for each set of parameters @xmath213 and @xmath52 we find the classical ground state characterized by @xmath254 , and @xmath255 . in our computation",
    "we fix the second - neighbor biquadratic exchange to be equal to @xmath256 mev/@xmath217 , but our results do not depend strongly on this value .",
    "we vary therefore two parameters of the model : the nearest - neighbor biquadratic exchange @xmath53 and the excess iron concentration @xmath3 , which affects indirectly the effective exchange couplings @xmath213 via the rkky interaction .    in figs .",
    "8 ( a)-(c ) , we draw the real - space spin configurations presented in the phase diagram of fig . 7 . among all possible states ,",
    "in the parameter space presented in the phase diagram , only three states are realized : the stripe phase characterized by @xmath257 shown in fig . 8 ( a ) , the double stripe phase characterized by @xmath258 shown in fig . 8 ( b ) and the incommensurate spiral ( labeled as ic )",
    "state shown in fig . 8 ( c ) characterized by @xmath259 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "8 ( c ) we show the ic state with an exaggerated canting angle . to clarify the structure of these different orderings",
    ", we also take the fourier transforms of the ground state spin configuration obtained by the minimization and then compute the corresponding spin structure factor .",
    "as expected , the structure factor exhibits peaks at the following ordering wave - vectors : @xmath7 for the stripe phase , @xmath260 for the bicollinear double - stripe phase , and @xmath10 for the ic phase .",
    "the structure of the phase diagram ( see fig . 7 ) can be summarized as follows . for small values of @xmath3 , there is a thin strip of the single - stripe phase .",
    "this phase is stabilized by a strong @xmath237 coupling ( see fig .",
    "6 ( b ) ) and quickly disappears because @xmath237 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "we believe that the stripe phase has not been observed in fe@xmath0te because all known compounds belonging to this family are , actually , nonstoichiometric and have a small amount of interstitial fe significantly larger than the boundary value of @xmath261 below which the stripe phase is stable .",
    "the central region in the phase diagram @xmath262 is occupied by the bicollinear double - stripe state .",
    "this is the state which is experimentally observed in the fe@xmath0te compound with a low level of excess fe . the stability of this phase over a wide range of parameters is explained by the smallness of the effective nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath239 and relatively strong strength of the third - neighbor coupling @xmath238 .",
    "the biquadratic couplings @xmath52 among which the dominating role is played by @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see appendix a ) , also play an important role in stabilizing this state : except in the region near @xmath240 , a finite value of the nearest - neighbor biquadratic coupling @xmath53 is necessary to stabilize the double stripe phase over the incommensurate spiral state .",
    "the region near @xmath240 is rather peculiar , as there the effective nearest neighbor coupling @xmath239 is equal to zero or is very small compared with the other interactions , making the bicollinear double stripe state the most stable one even in the absence of the biquadratic exchange .",
    "the rest of the phase diagram is occupied by an ic phase ( see , fig .",
    "8 ( c ) ) , which is the @xmath263 spiral state experimentally observed for sufficiently large @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) as a function of fe excess @xmath3 and the ratio between the first- and second - neighbor biquadratic exchanges , @xmath264 , computed with ( in mev/@xmath217 units ) @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 .",
    "the rkky interactions @xmath65 are shown in fig .",

    "@xcite , the phase transition from the bicollinear double stripe to the ic phase was observed approximately for @xmath269 .",
    "this is consistent with our phase diagram presented in fig . 7 if one takes @xmath270 , which seems to be a realistic ratio , since the magneto - elastic coupling favors the biquadratic exchange between second neighbors ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "we emphasize that , because our model contains assumptions about the bare values of @xmath227 and the amount of electrons introduced by each excess fe , the precise value of @xmath3 for which the transition takes place is beyond our scope . yet ,",
    "the general tendency of a double - stripe to ic transition for increasing charge doping encoded in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "7 is robust and consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "in summary , we have studied the evolution of the magnetic order in fe@xmath0te as function of @xmath3 . starting with a model containing both localized spins and itinerant electrons , we derived an effective superexchange hamiltonian to describe the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0te which contains both the long - range rkky - type spin - spin interaction mediated by the itinerant electrons and the biquadratic interactions due to magneto - elastic effects .",
    "thus , @xmath3-dependent exchange interactions naturally arise in our model due to changes in the low - energy itinerant electronic states promoted by charge doping .    after calculating the classical phase diagram of the @xmath3-dependent effective superexchange model",
    ", we showed that fe@xmath0te has a general tendency for a double - stripe to incommensurate - spiral transition with increasing excess iron concentration .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath3 , the magnetic order is a double - stripe state , arising due to the presence of a significant antiferromagnetic @xmath238 coupling , which has mostly localized origin . beyond a certain critical value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the incommensurate spiral state becomes the most stable .",
    "this transition is driven not only by the suppression of the antiferromagnetic exchanges @xmath238 and @xmath237 , but also by the enhancement ( in absolute value ) and sign change of the nearest - neighbor @xmath239 interaction , which changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "these changes are caused by the @xmath3-dependent rkky part of the interaction , and ultimately can be attributed to the suppression of the @xmath2 peaks in the itinerant spin - susceptibility and the transfer of magnetic spectral weight from the vicinities of @xmath271 to the vicinities of @xmath272 .",
    "these changes , in turn , are a direct consequence of the changes in the fermi surface of the itinerant electrons caused by the charge doping introduced by the excess fe . experimental data showing the sign of @xmath239 to be dependent on the interstitial fe concentration would be a strong validation of our model . the physics of fe@xmath0te discussed here bares many similarities with extensively studied double - exchange magnets , and in particular with manganites , whose effective coupling constants were shown to be significantly modified by charge doping .",
    "@xcite in both cases , the interplay between local moments and itinerant electrons leads to a rich behavior and to the appearance of new ground states in the classical phase diagram .",
