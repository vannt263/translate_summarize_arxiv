    "after the discovey of high temperature superconductors ( htss ) it was realized that the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) could be substantially enhanced by applying high pressures . this very interesting effect attracted a lot of attention as it is summarized by several review articles which have been written on the subject@xcite .",
    "the motivation for all this effort is not only the quest for higher temperatures but also to understand which are the parameters which optimise @xmath0 besides the possibility of follow the structural changes induced by pressure by means of x - rays and neutron difraction techniques .",
    "it is hoped that these investigations lead to the preparation of new materials by chemical substitution as well as some better insights on these highly complex systems .",
    "one of the effects of the pressure which is generally accepted and well documented in certain materials@xcite is an increase of the carrier concentration on the @xmath1 planes transferred from the reservoir layers .",
    "such pressure induced charge transfer ( pict ) has been confirmed by hall effect and thermoeletric power measurements in several compounds@xcite . therefore this effect combined with an assumption of an intrinsic variation of @xmath0 ( linear on the pressure ) independent of the charge transfer was largely explored to account for the quantitative relation between @xmath0 and the pressure p and gave origin to many models@xcite .",
    "some of these models also invoked that several htss have a @xmath2 versus carrier density @xmath3 ( per @xmath1 ) diagram which satisfies a phenomenological universal parabolic curve , i.e. , @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5 is the optimum @xmath3 .",
    "following along these lines we can write @xmath6 , @xmath7 and derive an expansion in powers of p , namely @xmath8 where the coefficients are ,    [ allequations ] @xmath9 and @xmath10    where the first term in @xmath11 is known as the intrinsic term and it was estimated to be constant@xcite .",
    "this approach was largely used in describing the data in the vicinity of @xmath5@xcite but fails to describe more recently measurements on different compounds with a large variation on the initial @xmath3 values from underdoped to overdoped regime@xcite .",
    "futhermore this phenomenological method does not provide any physical insight on the origin of the ( charge transfer independent ) intrinsic term .",
    "we propose in this work some new ideas which are general enough to be applied to any family of compounds and which provide some microscopic interpretation on the effects of pressure .",
    "we use as starting point a recently introduced approach@xcite based on a bcs type mean field analysis which uses the extended hubbard hamiltonian ( t - u - v ) on a square lattice ( of lattice parameter a )    @xmath12    for the sake of completeness we briefly outline the method .",
    "a gap equation at zero temperature is derived which has the same form as in the usual bcs theory , i.e. ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the potential of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which is approximately given by @xmath16    as in the bcs mean field method@xcite the gap has the same functional form of the potential , namely , @xmath17 , where the plus sign is for the s - wave and the minus sign is for d - wave channel .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath18 must be calculated self - consistently but as it concerns the superconducting phase boundary it suffices to approximate it by the value of the maximum energy ( concentration dependent ) in a tight - binding band .",
    "one then derives a finite temperature analog of eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) and in order to determine the phase boundary we take @xmath19 at the limit where @xmath20 is applied .",
    "the zero temperature and the finite temperature with @xmath19 gap equations are solved numerically and one matches @xmath0 with @xmath21 for a given carrier concentration @xmath3 .",
    "thus one obtains a phase diagram @xmath22 for a given @xmath21 which was found to reproduce well the experimental phase diagrams for the htss when the position of the attractive potential v was changed from the original nearest neighbor position and became an adjustable parameter@xcite .",
    "the ratio of u / v is not relevant to determine the phase diagram boundary as long as @xmath23 but , on the other hand , it determines the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the exact calculations of @xmath21 in terms of u and v are not easy to be performed in a many - body system and thus it becomes a second parameter to be determined by comparison with the experimental @xmath24 phase diagrams .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the chosen values for @xmath25 that reproduce the phase diagrams of the lanthanum and yttrium family of compounds are also in excelent agreement with the gap measurements taken from tunneling experiments and the specific heat .",
    "as concerns the ratio of the positions of v used for these families , it was also shown a posteriori that their values matches their ratio of the coherence length ( as discussed in ref.@xcite , these are strongly coupled systems and the bound states are confined which is not the case of weakly coupled systems ) thus providing a possible physical explanation for this quantity and why they are so different for the la and y families of compounds .    in connection with the above discussion",
    "we are led to propose that the effects of pressure are two - fold : ( i)- the well accepted pict ; ( ii)- the relation @xmath26 ( @xmath27 for weakly bcs and @xmath28 for the method mentioned above ) suggests that if @xmath29 is a linear function of the pressure p ( as assumed for the behavior of the intrinsic term@xcite ) than @xmath21 must also be a linear function of p. as concerns the hamiltonian of eq.(3 ) this is equivalent to say that the structural modifications due to the applied pressure induce a variation on the attractive potential v ( which is the most influencial parameter on the value of @xmath21 ) .",
    "in fact the real effect of the structural changes can only be estimate by electronic band calculations@xcite , but they are not adequate to be performed in the context of the strong correlations of the t - u - v hamiltonian .    thus the pict ( i ) implies that @xmath6 and the assumption of a pressure dependent gap ( ii ) implies @xmath30 which can be simple written as @xmath31 .",
    "on fig.1 we plot two curves calculated with two differents values of @xmath21 to study how @xmath32 change if the pressure induces a change in @xmath21 . therefore to estimate @xmath0 of a compound with an initial given value of @xmath3 and under a given pressure p , we perform an expansion of @xmath32 in terms of p. with the assumption of linear variation of @xmath3 and @xmath29 ( or @xmath21 ) on the pressure , we obtain only terms up to third order , that is ,    [ allequations ] @xmath33 with @xmath34    furthermore one can derive simple analytical expressions for each coefficient in an approximate way , using the universal parabolic fitting and with @xmath35 which explicits the @xmath0 dependency on p ( assumption ii ) .",
    "this procedure gives an intrinsic term which is radically different than that used before@xcite as well as a new third order term .",
    "to illustrate the entire method we will apply it to the mercury system .",
    "the mercury family of compounds represents a real challenge to any theory for the following reasons : ( a)- the highest transition temperatures obtained up to date have been measured on hg1223 at 25 - 30 gpa@xcite reaching values up to 164k .",
    "( b)-the various pressure data for the underdoped and overdoped compounds of @xmath36 ( hg1201 ) could not be interpreted@xcite by the models described in the introduction .",
    "( c)- the largest pressure effect on @xmath0 with a change of almost 50k over a span of 20 gpa has been recently measured by one of us@xcite in the hg2212 .    as a preeliminary step and also in order to determine the initial parameters , we need to study the @xmath37 phase diagram at zero pressure .",
    "thus we perform a calculation using the method of de mello@xcite to obtain a hg1201 phase diagram which is in agreement with the experimental results@xcite .",
    "as discussed above this method of calculation involves two parameters ; our best result is obtained with @xmath38 and the position of the attractive potential v at the @xmath39-neighbor .",
    "our results are plotted on fig.1 and , just for comparison and for future use , the phenomenological parabolic fitting with @xmath40 and @xmath41k as used by cao et al@xcite .",
    "thus the calculation for the hg family phase diagram is our first step and it is independent of the pressure studies which we will deal next .    to study the effects of the pressure we also plotted on fig.1 our calculation for the phase diagram with @xmath42 .",
    "we see that near @xmath43 the variations of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath21 are almost twice as those at the extremes ( low @xmath0 ) and since this is the origin of the intrinsic term , it also varies in the same way and this behavior will be discussed below .",
    "it is important to notice that the two partial derivatives that appear in eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) become two parameter to be determined by comparing with the @xmath44 measurements for two compounds with different charge density @xmath3 . at low pressures",
    "only the linear terms @xmath11 comes into play since the higher order coefficients are negligible .",
    "it is desirable ( but not crucial ) to start with @xmath45 to determine @xmath46 since at @xmath5 the charge transfer term vanishes . so with other set of @xmath47 data at another value of @xmath48 , we determine @xmath49 .",
    "after these two parameters being determined we can apply the expansion eq .",
    "( [ expp ] ) to any other compound with different value of @xmath3 .    to illustrate the above general procedure ,",
    "we will apply it to the low pressure results of cao et al@xcite for the hg1201 and those of higher pressures of gao et al@xcite .",
    "our purpose is to show that we can describe all their results with a single choise of parameters .",
    "thus to obtain the value of the two partial derivatives of eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) pertinent to their measurements we do the following ; we start with the set of data taken with the compound with @xmath43 , which has a @xmath47 curve at low pressures that is a straight line and from which we can infer that the linear term @xmath50k / gpa , which at @xmath5 , is equal to the intrinsic term and from this we determine @xmath46 . to determine the other partial derivative we study the @xmath47 plot made with the sample with @xmath51 .",
    "we see that the low pressure slope ( @xmath11 ) can be taken as @xmath52k / gpa . at @xmath51",
    "the intrinsic term is half of that at @xmath5 according the discussion on the above paragraph and therefore , the intrinsic term is @xmath53k / gpa and then the charge transfer must be equal to @xmath54k / gpa since the sum of both terms is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "using now the explicity expression for @xmath11 with the parabolic fitting with @xmath41k and @xmath55 we can derive that @xmath56holes / gpa .",
    "we notice that this value that we obtain for @xmath57 is very close to others estimations @xcite . thus with this procedure the two derivatives which comes in the calculations of the coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) are determined and we are set now to apply eq .",
    "( [ expp ] ) to any hg compound .",
    "far from @xmath5 the charge transfer term dominates over the intrinsic one and thus the linear term @xmath11 varies from the 2.6k / gpa chosen above at n=0.06 up to -1.0k / gpa ( at n=0.26 ) in the overdoped region .",
    "the results of our calculations for all other compounds with different densities @xmath3 are in excellent agreement with the low pressure experimental data in both the underdoped and overdoped regime and are plotted on figs.2a and 2b . in fig.3",
    "we show the results for the high pressures measurements for the three family of mercury@xcite at @xmath5",
    ". as one can see on fig.3 at the high pressures the quadratic and the cubic terms in the pressure expansion become important ( for @xmath58 gpa ) and the agreement with the data is also remarkable .",
    "it is very interesting that the parameters obtained above at the low pressures yielded results with the maxima around 30 gpa which is the value of highest @xmath0 for a htss@xcite .",
    "our results can also be applied to others measurements on differents families and compounds of hg which , at @xmath5 , also yielded the @xmath0 maxima around 30 gpa@xcite . for the first time a simple theory is capable to describe successfully all this ensemble of low and high pressure data and",
    "furthermore provides some insights on the microscopic effects of the pressure .",
    "thus , we conclude pointing out that our novel calculations ( based on a bcs type mean field with the extended hubbard hamiltonian ) demonstrate to be highly successful to describe the effects of the pressure with just two simple assumptions .",
    "the pict which is well accepted and that of the pressure induced variation of the superconductor gap which was introduced , to our knowledge , in this work .",
    "we hope that this assumption can be confirmed in the future by in situ experiments like specific heat and tunneling measurements . as this work came to completion",
    ", we learnt about the work of angilella et al@xcite which also uses the extended hubbard model within a bcs type approach .",
    "furthermore they estimate the effects of the pressure on the attractive potential v which goes along with the lines of our assumption over @xmath21 .",
    "they also obtained very good results for the effects of pressure in the bi2212 family , given more support to the bcs mean field calculations with the extended hubbard as a model for the the physics of the charge carriers in the htss .",
