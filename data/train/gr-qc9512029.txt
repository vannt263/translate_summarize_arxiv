    "although a large number of vacuum solutions of einstein s equations are known , the physical interpretation of many ( if not most ) of them remains unsettled ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "as stressed by bonnor  @xcite , the key to physical interpretation is to ascertain the nature of the sources which produce these vacuum space  times ; even in black - hole solutions , where no matter source is needed , an understanding of how a matter distribution gives rise to the black - hole space ",
    "time is necessary to judge the physical significance ( or lack of it ) of the complete analytic extensions of these solutions .    as to how we gain an understanding of the sources",
    ", there is really no substitute for constructing an interior solution for a matter distribution which matches to the vacuum space  time in question .",
    "the coordinate freedom of general relativity can make attempts to discover the nature of the source for a vacuum field a hazardous affair : in the vacuum space  time the source appears as a singularity in the curvature which may look quite different after a coordinate transformation  @xcite .",
    "if we have an interior solution however such coordinate transformations will invariably _ introduce _ a singularity in the interior and so must be rejected .",
    "although attempts are made to deduce properties of sources by analysis of the vacuum space ",
    "times which represent the exterior fields , this approach can never be conclusive ; only a complete interior and exterior solution will afford confidence in the analysis .    in this paper",
    "we construct sources for the vacuum space ",
    "time described by a diagonal metric depending on one spatial coordinate ; this vacuum solution , found by tullio levi  civita  @xcite , we shall write as @xmath5 where @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary constants .",
    "( in fact , by rescaling , ( [ levi ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath10 but the constant @xmath11 can not be removed if @xmath12 is to be a periodic coordinate with period @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "thus the levi  civita metric has two parameters when @xmath12 is periodic .",
    "the form ( [ levi ] ) is needed in matching to the interior solutions . )",
    "this space  time has in general a curvature singularity at @xmath14 and is flat in the limit @xmath15 ; the riemann tensor vanishes everywhere only for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    a test particle at rest in the coordinate system of the metric ( [ levi ] )",
    "will experience a proper acceleration @xmath18 for small @xmath1 this is approximately @xmath19 which is of the same form as the newtonian expression for the acceleration of a particle a distance @xmath20 from a line mass of mass per unit length @xmath1 .",
    "this well - defined newtonian limit is the reason why the levi - civita space ",
    "time is usually said to represent the field outside an infinitely long static cylinder  thus the @xmath12-coordinate is taken to be periodic  and cylinder sources have indeed been found for this space ",
    "time  @xcite .",
    "the sources found are of two types : static dust cylinders ( composed of equal amounts of dust rotating in opposite senses around the axis to produce zero net angular momentum ) which were shown to match to the levi ",
    "civita space ",
    "time for values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath21  @xcite , and perfect - fluid cylinders , one example of which could be matched to the levi ",
    "civita exterior for @xmath21  @xcite while the other example was valid for @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the interpretation of the levi - civita space  time as the relativistic field outside a line mass , at least for @xmath1 in the range @xmath4 .",
    "civita space  time does not contain timelike circular geodesics  @xcite ( when @xmath22 the circular geodesics are null , when @xmath23 they are spacelike ) . the explanation , suggested by the newtonian case , that this is due to the gravitational attraction becoming strong enough to prevent any particle ( including light ) orbiting circularly  @xcite has been contrasted with the fact that a study of the curvature invariants suggests that the field gets weaker as @xmath1 increases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( where the metric is flat but accelerated )  @xcite .",
    "however , although it sounds strange , what matters here is not the field ( i.e.  the curvature ) but the acceleration experienced by the test particle towards the source : this does not vanish at @xmath17 although the field does , and indeed the proper acceleration towards the origin experienced by a test particle at rest in the coordinate system of ( [ levi ] ) ( or of ( [ levigauss ] ) below ) _ increases _ as @xmath1 goes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . hence it is quite reasonable to conclude that the cylinder sources producing @xmath1 in the range @xmath26 have a gravitational attraction large enough to disallow circular orbits . ]    nevertheless , we can just as easily take all the coordinates in ( [ levi ] ) to be cartesian and the supposition then is that the levi  civita space ",
    "time represents the field outside an infinite static wall ; although this possibility has been noticed before  @xcite an example of such a wall source has not been constructed .",
    "indeed , the interpretation of @xmath12 as a cartesian coordinate appears more tenable for certain values of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , when @xmath17 the metric ( [ levi ] ) describes flat space  time in the local coordinate system of an observer undergoing constant acceleration in the @xmath27-direction  @xcite , and when @xmath28 the metric , in addition to the three killing vectors @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , admits a fourth killing vector @xmath32 which identifies it as taub s plane - symmetric metric  @xcite ( though in different coordinates ) ; these two metrics are the favourite proposals for the exterior field of a plane mass ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there is thus a rich structure to the vacuum metric ( [ levi ] ) ( for more detail , see  @xcite ) and we take the view that its physical significance can only be meaningfully explored by constructing sources which generate ( [ levi ] ) for a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "we shall construct both cylinder and wall sources for the levi ",
    " time ( [ levi ] ) , composed of perfect fluid .",
    "we work with the metric form @xmath33 the vacuum solution for which is given by ( [ levi ] ) .",
    "if @xmath12 is a periodic coordinate then this metric is cylindrically symmetric and static ; if all the coordinates are cartesian then the space ",
    "time is homogeneous on the spacelike @xmath34-planes but not ( in general ) isotropic on those planes ",
    "we therefore call this latter type _ plane - homogeneous",

    "plane - homogeneous solutions have been considered in the literature , though not by this name , the usual practice being simply to state that there is a @xmath35 on @xmath36 or that there are two spacelike killing vectors ( see  @xcite and references therein ) ; the similarity to plane symmetry and some resulting confusion has been noted  @xcite .",
    "li and liang  @xcite have introduced a title for this symmetry ; they found electrovac solutions where the metric is plane - symmetric but the electromagnetic field inherits only the two translational symmetries and not the rotational one and referred to these electromagnetic fields as having _ semi - plane symmetry_. we prefer the term `` plane - homogeneous '' because it gives a clearer idea of the symmetry involved than `` semi - plane - symmetric '' . ] in sec .  2 the field equations for ( [ synge ] ) with a perfect - fluid source",
    "are reduced to quadratures once the function @xmath37 is chosen ; the difference between cylindrically symmetric solutions and plane - homogeneous solutions emerges in the behaviour of the metric tensor at @xmath38 through the demand that the geometry be regular there . in sec  3",
    "we use this scheme to generate cylindrically symmetric and plane - homogeneous solutions with a boundary ( that is , solutions in which the pressure falls to zero at a finite value of @xmath27 ) which are then matched to the exterior ( levi  civita ) space  time ; a cylinder source can be matched for @xmath1 in the range @xmath0 , and a wall source for @xmath3 , where the positive ( negative ) values of @xmath1 correspond to a positive ( negative ) density for the fluid .",
    "these results are discussed in sec .",

    "in fact , lake and musgrave  @xcite have taken the set of fourteen independent second - order curvature invariants found by carminati and mclenaghan  @xcite and worked out the necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be finite at the origin of certain static space  times ; for the cylindrically symmetric case the conditions are , in our coordinate system , those deduced above , namely @xmath53 equations ( [ regcons ] ) are , then , the necessary and sufficient conditions for the metric ( [ synge ] ) to describe a cylindrically symmetric space  time which is regular on the axis . when the metric ( [ synge ] ) describes a plane - homogeneous space ",
    "time however , @xmath52 and the rest of the metric components must be non - zero constants at @xmath38 and with rescaling the metric can be written @xmath54 the coordinate @xmath12 now being a cartesian coordinate .",
    "it is this difference in the behaviour of the metric components at @xmath38 that distinguishes the cylindrically symmetric solutions from the plane - homogeneous ones .",
    "the content of the conservation equation @xmath55 comes from the component orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity , i.e.  @xmath56 , which yields @xmath57 and this relation can in fact be derived from the field equations ( [ fe1])([fe4 ] ) .",
    "thus we have four independent equations for the five unknown functions @xmath58 , @xmath52 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; therefore once one further relation is imposed  be it an equation of state for the fluid , an explicit form for one of the unknowns , or any other independent equation  everything is determined up to arbitrary constants .",
    "what we shall now show is that if this additional relation is an explicit form for the quantity @xmath37 , the metric components may be found by mere integration .    adding ( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) gives @xmath62 subtracting ( [ fe2 ] ) from ( [ fe3 ] ) gives @xmath63 which may be written @xmath64 multiplying across by @xmath37 and integrating gives @xmath65 for a cylindrically symmetric solution we must have , from ( [ beta2])([regcons ] ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,",
    "so that @xmath68 ; @xmath69 remains free if the solution is plane - homogeneous .",
    "we write the last formula as @xmath70 subtracting ( [ fe2 ] ) from ( [ fe1 ] ) we get @xmath71 and substituting for @xmath72 from ( [ al ] ) this becomes @xmath73 now @xmath74 so the previous equation becomes @xmath75 this is a quadratic for @xmath76 giving @xmath77 or @xmath78    the procedure for generating solutions is now clear : choose some function of @xmath27 as @xmath37 ; then @xmath59 is found by integrating ( [ ga ] ) , @xmath52 is given by @xmath79 , and @xmath58 is found by integrating ( [ al ] ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath37 determines the type of solution which will result : for a cylindrically symmetric solution the function @xmath37 must satisfy , from ( [ regcons ] ) , @xmath80 and , as explained above , in the previous equations we put @xmath68 ; for a plane - homogeneous solution we must have , from ( [ flatplane ] ) , @xmath81 , since the coordinates are now cartesian , and the constant @xmath69 remains arbitrary . by first substituting",
    "the chosen @xmath37 into ( [ pressure ] ) we can immediately obtain important physical information before deciding whether or not to proceed with generating the solution ; for since @xmath82 everywhere , ( [ pressure ] ) shows whether the pressure is positive or negative and whether it reaches zero at finite @xmath27 , thus allowing this value of @xmath27 to be taken as a boundary and a vacuum solution to be joined on",
    ". however the behaviour of the density @xmath61 can only be judged after @xmath83 , @xmath76 and @xmath72 have been derived and substituted into ( [ fe4 ] ) .",
    "finally we show that plane - symmetric solutions are also produced by this procedure .",
    "we have remarked that the plane - homogeneous metric obtaining when @xmath12 is cartesian in ( [ synge ] ) is distinguished from the plane - symmetric metric by lacking a third spacelike killing vector @xmath32 .",
    "suppose now that ( [ synge ] ) has this killing vector ; then the killing equation @xmath84 gives @xmath85 now this is implemented by putting @xmath86 in ( [ al ] ) ; hence , after generating a plane - homogeneous solution it is simply a matter of setting @xmath86 and a plane - symmetric solution results .",
    "prior to this the only schemes for generating perfect - fluid solutions of the form ( [ synge ] ) appear to be those of evans  @xcite and kramer  @xcite . starting with different coordinate systems from that used here",
    "these authors also reduced the problem to the choosing of a generating function , after which everything else is determined . in these formulations",
    "however one must either solve a second - order linear homogeneous differential equation  @xcite or a pair of coupled first - order equations  @xcite .",
    "our method has the advantage that the entire solution is reduced to quadratures once the generating function is chosen  there are no differential equations to solve ; in addition , our method allows the immediate assessment of important physical information ( the pressure ) , a feature lacking in the aforementioned schemes .",
    "these solutions are sources for the levi ",
    "civita space  time ( [ levi ] ) , the physical interpretation of which will be accordingly illuminated . in this",
    "regard we shall be considering , in addition to solutions which are physically acceptable , solutions with negative mass so as clarify when the levi  civita metric represents a negative - mass source .",
    "the only static perfect - fluid cylinders with boundary to be found in the literature are those of evans  @xcite and davidson  @xcite and we give for the first time a plane - homogeneous solution representing an infinite wall of perfect fluid with a boundary .",
    "the boundary occurs when the pressure of the fluid vanishes at some finite value of @xmath27 , @xmath87 say .",
    "the matching condition between interior and exterior is that the first and second fundamental forms of the boundary hypersurface @xmath87 shall be the same when calculated in both regions  @xcite ; this requires , in addition to continuity of the metric components at @xmath87 , continuity of the first derivatives of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "unlike the density @xmath61 , @xmath136 is well - behaved when @xmath86 ; as @xmath159 , @xmath136 , like @xmath1 , goes to  @xmath160 .",
    "in the previous section we constructed a perfect - fluid cylinder with positive density and pressure and found that matching to the levi ",
    "civita exterior was possible for @xmath4 ; this is the same range of @xmath1 as bonnor and davidson  @xcite found for their cylinder source .",
    "in addition , we matched a negative - density , perfect - fluid cylinder to the levi  civita metric for which @xmath1 could take values in the range @xmath161 .",
    "we also showed that the levi ",
    "civita space ",
    "time represents the exterior field of a plane mass : we constructed a perfect - fluid wall with positive density and pressure which matches to the levi  civita metric for @xmath162 , and also a negative - density , perfect - fluid wall for which this match gives @xmath163 .",
    "the previous work on static cylinder sources in conjunction with the results obtained here leads us to suspect that a perfect - fluid cylinder source for the levi ",
    "civita space  time does not exist outside the range @xmath0 .",
    "this exterior field provides a relativistic analogue of the newtonian line - mass field ; it has a clear newtonian limit , given by @xmath2 , wherein @xmath1 approaches the newtonian mass per unit length .",
    "there is however no justification for calling @xmath1 the mass per unit length far from this limit and hence concluding that there is an upper limit on the mass per unit length of a relativistic perfect - fluid cylinder ; such an idea has no well - defined meaning in general relativity as we have illustrated by using the tolman mass formula to calculate the quantity @xmath136 given by ( [ cyltolman ] ) , which has as much a claim to be the `` mass per unit length '' as @xmath1 in that it gives the correct newtonian limit , but which takes the range @xmath164 for our cylinder sources .    what about cylinder sources other than perfect - fluid ?",
    "if we allow arbitrary energy  momentum tensors then there _ do _ exist cylinder sources for the levi ",
    "civita space ",
    "time outside the range @xmath0 ; for example , the metric given by @xmath165 describes a static cylinder with energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath166 at @xmath87 , @xmath167 and a correct match may be made to the levi  civita metric ( [ levi ] ) , giving @xmath168 , @xmath169 . for positive @xmath104 and @xmath116",
    "the complete solution is well - behaved everywhere and the cylinder has positive density and positive radial and azimuthal pressures , with a longitudinal stress equal to the density .",
    "this last property , @xmath170 ( familiar from cosmic string theory ) , represents an exotic relativistic situation and so although for @xmath168 at least , one can find both a cylinder and a wall source , we are inclined to the view that any cylinder source valid for @xmath1 outside @xmath0 will be composed of rather bizarre relativistic material , at least in comparison to a perfect fluid .    what are we to conclude regarding the levi  civita space  time as the field outside a plane mass ?",
    "it is more difficult to find a firm basis for the analysis here because of the lack of a newtonian limit .",
    "such a limit could be identified by considering the proper acceleration of a test particle initially at rest with respect to the wall ; in the newtonian limit this acceleration would approach a constant value throughout the exterior and this constant is then @xmath171 times the newtonian mass per unit area .",
    "but the acceleration in question is given by ( [ accel ] ) and this is not a constant for any real value of @xmath1 .",
    "this result is not so surprising when we consider that in this putative newtonian limit test particles at rest anywhere in the coordinate system of metric ( [ levi ] ) , that is at rest relative to the wall , would have to experience the same acceleration away from the wall ( to counteract the uniform force directed towards the wall ) . but a coordinate frame in which all points experience the same proper acceleration can not remain rigid in the sense that the proper distances between spacelike - separated points must change with time ; hence the components of the metric tensor in this coordinate frame must depend on the time coordinate and therefore the levi  civita metric can not achieve this limit .",
    "nevertheless we have found that the levi ",
    "civita space ",
    "time can represent the exterior field of a wall of perfect fluid for @xmath3 . as remarked above",
    ", the usual suspects for the exterior field of a plane mass are the taub metric ( @xmath28 ) and the flat accelerated metric ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these two appear as the bounding values of the exterior fields of the perfect - fluid wall ( and cylinder ) sources we have constructed , in the cases of negative and positive mass density respectively .",
    "it therefore appears from this work that if perfect - fluid sources for these two metrics exist they are not continuously related to perfect - fluid sources for neighbouring values of @xmath1 . at any rate , the only perfect - fluid walls with boundary the author has found using the procedure of sec .  2 and which upon matching to the levi  civita metric produce a range of @xmath1 including @xmath172 are such that @xmath173 , that is the exterior space ",
    "time has a plane singularity .",
    "in fact these solutions are valid for _ all _ values of @xmath1 ( including @xmath16 , where however the source does not vanish ) .",
    "although an attempt has been made to give some meaning to this type of plane singularity  @xcite , in this case we regard only singularity - free solutions as being of physical interest .    if we again allow for more unorthodox energy ",
    "momentum tensors , wall sources for @xmath174 can certainly be found . a wall source for the taub metric ( @xmath28 )",
    "is given by @xmath175 t^r_{\\ r}=\\frac{a^2}{8\\pi{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{s}\\right ) \\qquad t^z_{\\ z}=t^\\phi_{\\ \\phi}=-\\frac{a}{16\\pi s{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2 }           \\left(1-\\frac{ar^2}{2s}\\right ) ,   \\qquad   t^t_{\\ t}=\\frac{a^2}{8\\pi{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which matches to the levi  civita metric at @xmath87 with @xmath28 , @xmath176 .",
    "if @xmath104 and @xmath116 are positive the solution is well - behaved everywhere and the wall has negative density ( which tallies with its repulsive exterior field ) ; the radial pressure is positive up to the boundary and @xmath177 may be negative in some regions and positive in others , depending on the value of @xmath104 . a wall source for the accelerated metric @xmath17 is @xmath178 t^r_{\\",
    "r}=\\frac{a}{8\\pi s^2{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2{\\ensuremath{\\gamma}}}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{s}\\right ) \\left(2s+as^2-ar^2\\right ) , \\qquad t^z_{\\ z}=t^\\phi_{\\ \\phi}=-\\frac{a}{8\\pi s{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2 } ,   \\\\[10pt ] t^t_{\\ t}=-\\frac{a}{8\\pi{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}^2 }    \\left[\\frac{2}{s}-a\\left(1-\\frac{r}{s}\\right)^2\\right].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this matches to the levi  civita metric at @xmath87 with @xmath17 , @xmath179 . the space ",
    "time is well - behaved everywhere if @xmath104 and @xmath116 are positive and moreover the density is positive throughout the interior if @xmath180 ; then @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "these two sources are physically unappealing and are presented here simply to show that wall sources for @xmath174 exist ; there is nothing in this work to support the interpretation of either of these metrics as the general - relativistic plane - mass field .",
    "there is a further oddity of the wall sources , to be seen in the variation of the proper acceleration of a test particle ( [ accel ] ) with @xmath1 .",
    "we first rewrite ( [ accel ] ) in gaussian normal coordinates @xmath183 , wherein @xmath184 ; the levi  civita metric in these coordinates is @xmath185 and ( [ accel ] ) becomes @xmath186 this form is preferable to ( [ accel ] ) because it isolates the @xmath1-dependence . as a result @xmath187 as a function of @xmath1 has the same form regardless of the value of @xmath188 ; this form is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the proper acceleration increases as @xmath1 goes from @xmath129 to @xmath25 ( @xmath129 to @xmath130 ) but falls to zero as @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) !",
    "although the lack of a newtonian limit means there is nothing we can term the mass per unit area for even a limited range of @xmath1 , zero acceleration would be expected to occur only when the source vanishes or when a combination of negative density and positive pressure ( or vice versa ) conspires to produce zero gravitational mass .",
    "this is certainly not the case for the wall with positive density and pressure for which the limit @xmath189 is produced by @xmath159 : the total gravitational mass can not be zero and in no way does the limit @xmath159 correspond to the wall vanishing  the position of the boundary is unaffected and the density becomes infinite .",
    "some insight into the nature of the system in this @xmath191 limit is afforded by the levi  civita line element in gaussian normal coordinates ( [ levigauss ] ) .",
    "this form has a well - defined @xmath191 limit which is @xmath192 this metric is _ flat _ , being transformable to a manifestly minkowskian form by @xmath193 metric ( [ hyper ] ) has the general _ appearance _ of flat space  time in cylindrical polar coordinates , with @xmath194 in the role of the angular coordinate , and ( [ flattrans ] ) that of the usual transformation from cylindrical polars to cartesian coordinates . but @xmath194 is _ not _ a periodic coordinate and if ( [ flattrans ] ) were enforced globally it would have the effect of changing the topology of the exterior : ( [ flattrans ] ) assumes that the points @xmath194 and @xmath195 are identified and consequently this transformation is only valid in a local region covered by a range of @xmath194 smaller than @xmath196 .",
    "( were we to take @xmath194 in the exterior as periodic we would have to do so in the interior also , thus producing a singularity in the source . ) the geometry of the space part of ( [ hyper ] ) is flat but rather bizarre : if we take two points on the boundary of the wall with different @xmath194-coordinate values and extend a straight ( we are in flat space ) line perpendicular to the boundary from each point , then the @xmath194-separation of these two straight lines is proportional to the distance from the wall , whereas the @xmath12-separation remains constant .",
    "although the @xmath191 limit is not physically realizable , corresponding to a diverging density , and although we have nothing to call the mass per unit area , it is still curious that the acceleration in figure  1 due to the wall should approach zero as the density diverges .",
    "but , as discussed above , we are dealing here with a completely relativistic system ; wall sources for the levi ",
    "civita space ",
    "time have no newtonian limit to accommodate along with our newtonian - based intuition about how a plane mass affects matter .",
    "an interesting question is : can a wall source be found in general relativity which _ does _ possess the newtonian plane - mass limit ? as remarked above , the exterior line element , in which the source is at rest , must depend on the time coordinate , so evidently this source will not be static .",
