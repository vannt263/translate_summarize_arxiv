    "magnetic activity is a common feature of late - type stars .",
    "the general hypothesis assumes that some magnetic dynamo mechanism ( @xmath6 dynamo ) occurs at the interface between the radiative core of the star and its outer convective zone .",
    "however , objects with masses below 0.3  @xmath7 ( spectral type later than m3 ) are generally believed to be fully convective , and thus can not support the @xmath6 dynamo .",
    "nevertheless , magnetic activity is commonly seen , even in very late m - type objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an alternative dynamo mechanism ( @xmath8 dynamo ) , involving turbulent magnetic fields , has been proposed to take place in fully convective objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the h@xmath9 emission ( a common tracer of chromospheric activity ) in late - type stars have shown a steep decrease for spectral types later than m7 despite their fast rotation @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission also appears to decrease , although the sample of studied stars is limited ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was thus a surprise when @xcite found no decline in radio activity between spectral types m3 and l3.5 , and even suggested a possible increase in radio luminosity with cooler effective temperature .",
    "recent results seem to support such a trend in late - m / early - l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "old t - type brown dwarfs are , therefore , attractive objects to observe , in order to understand magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs . however , observations of t dwarfs are scarce in the radio and were nonexistent in x - rays .",
    "this paper extends the previous investigations into the t dwarf domain .",
    "we present the first observation of a t dwarf in x - rays with the _ chandra _   x - ray observatory along with a deep observation in the radio regime with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "our target , @xmath10 ind bab , is the closest known brown dwarf and is composed of two objects with spectral types t1 and",
    "t6 separated by @xmath11 ( @xmath12  au at a distance of @xmath13  pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we list the binary s main characteristics in table  [ tab : epsind ] .",
    "@xcite failed to detect @xmath10 ind bab with atca , but our radio observation goes deeper .",
    "despite our best effort to coordinate the _",
    "chandra _   and",
    "atca observations of the @xmath10 ind bab binary , the x - ray observations were delayed by a few days due to satellite safety reasons .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the atca was in a long - baseline configuration ( 6d ) ; we used 4.8  ghz and 8.64  ghz receivers with bandwidths of 128  mhz . observing scans ranged from 10  min to 20  min on source , depending on the weather conditions , whereas we used 3  min scans for the phase calibrator .",
    "about 5 minutes at the start of each observing round were spent on the flux calibrator .",
    "the observing conditions on the first day were average with cloud coverage ; however , the last three hours of the first day of observation were essentially useless due to strong winds and a thunderstorm .",
    "in contrast , the weather conditions were much better during the second day with generally a cloud - free sky .",
    "we combined both observing rounds and reduced the atca data using the miriad software @xcite .",
    "we detected 9 sources in the 4.8  ghz map ; we used boxes of about 20   width centered on these sources and applied a clean algorithm using uniform weighting . about @xmath14",
    "mjy were thus removed in 202 iterations ( we stopped when a negative value was encountered ) .",
    "although no sources were visible in the dirty map at 8.64  ghz , we used the boxes around the first five brightest sources detected at longer wavelengths and performed a clean algorithm . about @xmath15",
    "mjy were removed after 38 iterations .",
    "the rms noise level in the cleaned maps reached @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xmath18jy   at 4.8 and 8.64  ghz , respectively .",
    "the values are close to the theoretical values ( @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xmath18jy ) .",
    "no source was detected at the expected position of the t - type brown dwarf binary ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : log ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : atcamaps ] ) . since short duration flares could be missed in the 2-day images , we have generated maps down to 1-hour duration but still detected no source ( typical rms noise levels of @xmath21  @xmath18jy   and @xmath22  @xmath18jy   at 4.8 and 8.64  ghz , respectively ) .",
    "our non - detection limits are consistent with those of @xcite but we went deeper since we observed @xmath10 ind bab about twice as long . at the distance of the binary ( @xmath13  pc ) , the @xmath0 upper limits correspond to radio luminosities , @xmath23 , of @xmath1 and @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3  hz@xmath3   at 4.8 and 8.64  ghz , respectively .",
    "_ chandra _   observed @xmath10 ind bab at two different times .",
    "we reduced both data sets with the ciao  3.1 software in combination with caldb 2.29 .",
    "the data were taken in very faint mode which allowed us to further reduce the background level .",
    "we later merged both event files into one single event file ( total exposure of @xmath24  ksec ) .",
    "no signal was detected at the expected position of @xmath10 ind bab ( tab .",
    "[ tab : log ] ) ; this was confirmed with several source detection algorithms .",
    "figure  [ fig : chandraim ] shows an extract of the _ chandra _   acis - s image ( @xmath25  kev ) .",
    "@xcite tentatively associated the _ rosat _",
    "source 1wga j220 - 5647 with @xmath10",
    "however , thanks the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , we assign the _ rosat _ source to a nearby bright x - ray source instead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chandraim ] ) .",
    "no optical or near - infrared counterpart to this source could be found in digitized sky survey and two micron all sky survey images .",
    "no events were detected within @xmath26 ( 95% of the encircled energy at 0.3  kev ) of the expected position of @xmath10 ind bab in the @xmath25  kev range .",
    "note that , without the energy filtering , 4 events were detected but all had energies above 10  kev casting severe doubt that they were due to the source rather than the background . furthermore , increasing the extraction radius to 3   only allows the detection of a single event . to estimate the background contribution",
    ", we used a concentric annulus with an inner radius of @xmath27   and an outer radius calculated such that the annulus area was 100 times larger than the area of the circle around the binary ( i.e , @xmath28 ) .",
    "a total of 77 events were detected ; consequently , the scaled estimated background contribution is @xmath29 events , i.e. , a mean background rate of @xmath30  ct  ks@xmath3 .",
    "we then followed the approach of @xcite to determine the upper confidence limit using a bayesian confidence level of 95% which corresponded to @xmath31 counts .",
    "to convert this count rate of @xmath32  ct  ks@xmath3   into an x - ray luminosity , we used one plasma component with solar photospheric abundances @xcite using the apec 1.3.1 code @xcite in the xspec software @xcite .",
    "we obtained count rates in the @xmath25  kev band and x - ray fluxes in the @xmath4  kev band .",
    "the latter fluxes were converted into x - ray luminosities , @xmath33 , using the distance of @xmath10 ind bab . for plasma temperatures of @xmath34 to @xmath35",
    "kev , the conversion factor is constant , i.e. , @xmath36  erg  s@xmath3   per ct  ks@xmath3 . for cooler plasma temperatures ,",
    "the conversion factor increases by factors of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40  kev , respectively .",
    "similarly , the factor increases by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44  kev , respectively .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath45  kev , we obtain @xmath46  erg  s@xmath3 . in the worst case ( @xmath47  kev ) , our upper limit increases to @xmath48  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "since the atca could not separate the binary and _ chandra _   would have barely done so , our upper limits ( @xmath23 and @xmath33 ) can either be attributed to one binary component or the other .",
    "table  [ tab : lum ] gives the upper limits of the luminosity ratios to the bolometric luminosity for each component .",
    "our radio upper limits , @xmath49  hz@xmath3 , do not go as deep as for dme stars , which are typically detected with ratios of the order of @xmath50  hz@xmath3 .",
    "however , the limit at 8.64  ghz is deeper for @xmath10 ind ba than the upper limit obtained at 8.46  ghz with the vla by @xcite for a t6 brown dwarf ( our limit at 8.64  ghz for @xmath10 ind bb is , however , equivalent ) .",
    "berger hypothesized that the radio luminosity relative to the bolometric luminosity would increase with later spectral type , and their strong detection of an l dwarf in radio appears to support this @xcite . similarly , despite the lack of sensitivity of current radio instruments , such a trend is also suggested in a small survey of southern late - m and l dwarfs @xcite . on the other hand , our upper limits for",
    "t dwarfs do not indicate that this trend continues into the t dwarf domain .",
    "deep observations of t dwarfs can , in principle , be very useful since they provide data points at low @xmath51 ; however , the exposure required to achieve the necessary sensitivity for comparison with dme dwarfs ( i.e. , @xmath52  hz@xmath3 ) must await the advent of the next generation of radio telescopes .",
    "in contrast , the sensitivity of _ chandra _   allows us to obtain a low @xmath53 ratio .",
    "we reach an upper limit about @xmath54 times lower than the @xmath53 ratios observed in active dme stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , our limit is close to the ratio observed in the sun ( as a star ) at its activity maximum and to the ratio observed in early - dm stars that do not show h@xmath9 in emission @xcite .",
    "although x - ray observations of ultracool dwarfs are rare ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray emission in such dwarfs appears to decline like the h@xmath9 emission .",
    "most x - ray detections were actually obtained during flares , with only a few objects detected in quiescence .",
    "our non - detection of the t - type @xmath10 ind bab with _",
    "chandra _",
    "reinforces the view that the x - ray emission in ultracool dwarfs declines significantly with later spectral type .",
    "@xcite suggested that magnetic activity is strong in ultracool dwarfs , in fact much stronger than in dme stars , but that it manifests itself mostly in the radio , as atmospheric conditions in such dwarfs become unfavorable for h@xmath9 and x - ray emission due to the decoupling of the magnetic field from the neutral photospheric gas @xcite .",
    "taken alone , the lack of x - rays from @xmath10 ind bab could , in principle , support this view .",
    "however , @xcite noted that fast rotators ( @xmath55  km  s@xmath3 ) have high @xmath56 ratios . but @xmath10 ind bab does not follow this trend : @xcite found that the t1 component is a fast rotator ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "note that the stellar radius and period are similar to those of the l3.5 dwarf detected in radio ( but not in x - rays or h@xmath9 ) by @xcite .",
    "possibly , the suggested trend observed in late - m / early - l dwarfs does not hold in the old , cool t dwarfs ( @xmath58  k ) .",
    "our observation thus suggests a physical change in magnetic behavior somewhere in the range of t dwarfs .",
    "alternatively , the observed sample of l and t dwarfs is too limited and sensitivity is lacking .",
    "magnetically active stars often show a relation between the quiescent x - ray and radio luminosities @xcite .",
    "the gdel - benz relation points toward a close connection between non - thermal electrons observed as gyrosynchrotron emission and the thermal plasma radiating in x - rays .",
    "the origin of this connection remains unclear ; however , there is increasing evidence that the x - ray emission in magnetically active stars is due to the statistical superposition of flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the radio and x - ray light curves of flares are often correlated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , coronal heating by flares provides an elegant explanation for the time - average @xmath59 relation observed in active stars . however , ultracool dwarfs seem not to follow this relation since they show stronger radio emission with respect to the x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates either that magnetic activity in such dwarfs is different @xcite , or possibly that the radio emission mechanism differs significantly from gyrosynchrotron .",
    "indeed , the emission of many flares in m dwarfs can be ascribed to a coherent mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of @xmath10 ind bab , we obtained only upper limits for both radio and x - ray regimes ; thus it is unclear whether the t brown dwarfs follow the gdel - benz relation or not .",
    "we have presented deep observations of @xmath10 ind bab , a t1+t6 brown dwarf binary at 3.626  pc , in x - rays with _",
    "chandra _   and in the radio with atca .",
    "the binary remained undetected , with upper limits of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63  hz@xmath3 ( at 4.8  ghz ) for @xmath10 ind ba and bb , respectively .",
    "the non - detection in the radio is in contrast with the trend of increasing @xmath56 with later spectral type suggested by @xcite and @xcite in late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "@xcite argued that the neutral atmospheres in ultracool dwarfs lead to unfavorable conditions for the x - ray and h@xmath9 emissions @xcite , but not for the radio emission of fast rotators .",
    "however , the t1 component in @xmath10 ind bab is a rapid rotator with similar period and radius as the l dwarf detected strongly in the radio ( but undetected in x - rays and h@xmath9 ) by @xcite .",
    "therefore , our @xmath10 ind bab observations indicate that cool t dwarfs may not follow the trend suggested by @xcite and colleagues . however , a definitive conclusion is difficult to reach in view of the limited sample of ultracool dwarfs observed in the radio and in x - rays and of the lack of sensitivity of present radio ( and x - ray ) instruments .",
