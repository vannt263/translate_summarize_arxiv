    "the next future large experiment in high energy physics will most probably be a future linear collider ( lc ) in the energy range between lep and o(1  tev ) .",
    "the existing world ",
    "wide proposals are designed with high luminosity of about @xmath4@xmath5s@xmath6 at @xmath7  gev and @xmath8@xmath5s@xmath6 at @xmath9  gev , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a lc will not only be well suited to complement @xcite but also to extend the physics program of the hadron colliders , the tevatron and the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "a lc has a large potential for the discovery of new particles and is  due to its clear signatures  very well suited for the precise analysis of new physics ( np ) as well as of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "providing precision studies in this energy range , in particular in the electro ",
    "weak sector , even small traces of physics beyond the sm might be found , even if high scale particles of a np might not be directly produced at the lhc or the first phase of a lc .",
    "for these studies the gigaz option of the lc , i.e. running with very high luminosity at the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 threshold , is decisive .",
    "an important tool of a lc is the use of polarised beams . in the following",
    "we will summarise some highlights of searches and analyses of new physics with the help of polarised beams @xcite .",
    "already in the base line design it is foreseen to use electron beams polarised to around @xmath12 via a strained photocathode technology @xcite similar to those at the slc where in the last year of running 1994/95 @xmath13 ( @xcite and references therein ) was reached . in order to generate also polarised positrons the use of a helical undulator is favoured producing polarised photons which generate via pair production positrons with a designed polarisation degree of about 40% ( with full intensity of the @xmath3 beam ) up to 60% ( with probably about 55% intensity ) @xcite .",
    "there already exists a world  wide collaboration supporting the activities to get a prototype for a polarised positron source at the 50 gev final focus test beam at slac @xcite .",
    "it is foreseen to measure the polarisation with compton polarimetry and it is assumed that one could reach even an accuracy better than @xmath14 @xcite . the simultaneous use of m@xmath15ller polarimetry will also be studied at the lc @xcite",
    ". however , the reachable accuracy with compton and m@xmath15ller polarimetry will not be sufficient for the high precision tests at gigaz .",
    "for this purpose one uses an alternative blondel scheme @xcite , see next section , where one expresses the polarisation via polarised cross sections",
    ". therefore one can avoid absolute measurements of polarisation and uses polarimetry only for relative measurements .",
    "after a short introduction into the physics of beam polarisation we begin our summary with high precision studies of the sm as a motivation for new physics searches .      within the standard model ( sm )",
    "only @xmath16 couplings happen in the s  channel and therefore the configurations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are possible for the @xmath19 helicities .",
    "that means that once the @xmath2 polarisation is chosen also the @xmath3 polarisation is fixed . for these processes",
    "an additional simultaneous positron polarisation leads to an enhancement ( or suppression ) of the fraction of the colliding particles , which is expressed by the effective luminosity @xmath20 and of the effective polarisation @xmath21 in table  [ tab_desch ] we list @xmath22 and @xmath23 for some characteristic values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "one can see that even with a completely polarised @xmath2 beam the fraction of colliding particles is not enhanced , however , with simultaneously polarised positrons this fraction will be enhanced .",
    "it is well  known that with suitably polarised beams one can suppress background processes , e.g. the dominating sm backgrounds @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "some scaling factors @xmath28 for these processes are given in table  [ tab_back ] .",
    "moreover , beyond the sm there are also coupling structures in the s - channel possible where also the configurations @xmath29 and @xmath30 could lead to strong signals .",
    "simultaneous polarisation of both beams would lead therefore to fast and easy diagnostics and we will give one example .    .",
    "fraction of colliding particles ( @xmath31 ) and the effective polarisation ( @xmath23 ) for different beam polarisation configurations , which are characteristic for ( v - a ) processes in the s  channel @xcite .",
    "[ tab_desch ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one could also extend the mssm without changing the gauge group , by introducing an additional higgs singlet : it leads to the ( m+1)ssm with one additional neutralino . since the mass spectra of the four light neutralinos could be similar to those in the mssm in some parts of the ( m+1)ssm / mssm parameter space , a distinction between these models might be difficult via spectra and rates alone .",
    "however , polarisation effects might then indicate the different coupling structure in the ( m+1)ssm @xcite and help disentangling the models , fig .",

    "the use of polarised beams in this context enlarges on one hand the sensitivity to the new scale @xmath38 and suppresses on the other hand the main background @xmath39 significantly .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 is enhanced by a factor of about 2.1 ( 4.4 ) if @xmath41 ( and @xmath42 ) is used .",
    "a linear collider in the tev range with its clean initial state of @xmath43 collisions is ideally suited for the search for new physics , for the determination of both standard model and non - standard couplings with high precision and for revealing the structure of the underlying model .",
