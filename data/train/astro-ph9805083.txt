    "a number of authors have proposed that the galaxy could contain a hitherto - unrecognized population of small , cold , dense self - gravitating gas clouds , in numbers sufficient to contribute an appreciable fraction of the gravitational mass of the galaxy ( pfenniger , combes , & martinet 1994 ; gerhardt & silk 1996 ; combes & pfenniger 1997 ) .",
    "walker & wardle ( 1998 ; hereafter ww98 ) pointed out that if such clouds existed in the galactic halo , each would have an ionized envelope which could explain the `` extreme scattering events '' , or `` eses '' , ( fiedler et al . 1987 ) during which extragalactic point radio sources occasionally undergo substantial frequency - dependent amplification and deamplification , apparently due to refraction by a plasma `` lens '' moving across the line - of - sight .",
    "ww98 proposed that the observed frequency of such eses could be explained if there was a population of @xmath3 cold self - gravitating gas clouds , with mass @xmath4 , and radius @xmath5 .",
    "gerhardt & silk ( 1996 ) and ww98 noted that if the clouds were opaque , their presence would have been revealed by existing stellar monitoring programs studying gravitational `` microlensing '' ( paczynski 1986 ; see the review by paczynski 1996 , and references therein ) , as these experiments would have detected occultation events of duration @xmath6 .",
    "such occultation events have not been reported .",
    "however , the hypothesized clouds could be essentially transparent at optical wavelengths : they could have formed from primordial gas , or , if formed from gas containing metals , the grains could have sedimented to form a small core .    in this _",
    "letter _ we point out that even transparent clouds would have lensing effects which would be detectable by the stellar monitoring studies currently underway to study gravitational lensing by compact objects in our galaxy .",
    "existing data can thus test the hypothesis that cold gas clouds contribute an appreciable fraction of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "we consider nonrotating polytropic models for self - gravitating h@xmath7-he gas clouds of radius @xmath8 . the polytropic index @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is assumed to be in the range @xmath11 ; for @xmath12 the cloud would be convectively unstable , while for @xmath13 the central density is infinite .",
    "we do not expect @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be accurately described by a polytropic model , but a slight rise in temperature toward the interior may be reasonable since the interior will be heated by high energy cosmic rays , with the few cooling lines [ e.g. , h@xmath70 - 0s(0 ) 28.28@xmath16 , or hd 0 - 0r(1 ) 112@xmath16 ] very optically thick . furthermore , these polytropes have @xmath18 , so the density structure near the surface is unphysical .",
    "table [ tab : polytropes ] gives various properties for h@xmath7-he polytropes , including the half - mass radius @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 relative to the mean density @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 , the refractive index @xmath26 is m ( ) = 1 + ( )  ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 for h@xmath7/he gas with 24% he by mass ( aip handbook 1972 ) .    for small deflections , a light ray with impact parameter @xmath29 will be deflected through an angle ( b ) = -2b _ b^  .",
    "[ eq : phi ] there is a small additional gravitational deflection ( henriksen & widrow 1995 ) , but this is negligible compared to gaseous refraction .",
    "let @xmath30 and and @xmath31 be the distance from source to lens , and from lens to observer . if @xmath32 is the distance of the lens center from the straight line from source to observer ( see fig .  [",

    "we define a `` strength '' parameter s = 3.55(m10 ^ -3)(r)^4 ( d10 )  .",
    "[ eq : sdef ] when @xmath42 is of order unity , large amplifications ( and deamplifications ) are possible even for @xmath43 of order unity , whereas if @xmath44 , appreciable amplification only occurs for @xmath45 .",
    "for each polytropic index we define the critical strength @xmath46 to be the value of @xmath42 such that for @xmath47 there are 3 images for @xmath48 and one image for @xmath49 .",
    "values of @xmath50 are given in table [ tab : polytropes ] .",
    "for each case with @xmath48 we define the critical source impact parameter @xmath51 such that there is one image for @xmath52 , and 3 images for @xmath53 . for @xmath48 a light curve for which @xmath54 will have `` cusps '' at the points where @xmath55 , as two images either appear ( for @xmath56 decreasing ) or merge and disappear ( for @xmath56 increasing ) .    figures [ fig : n=2][fig : n=4 ] show light curves for lenses with polytropic indices @xmath57 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the following general behavior is found : ( 1 ) for @xmath58 the lensing is weak , with peak amplification @xmath59 ; ( 2 ) for @xmath60 the peak amplification can be very large , even though only one image is formed ; ( 3 ) for @xmath61 the peak amplification is very large , and light curves with @xmath54 have conspicuous cusps where the amplification for a point source is infinite ; ( 4 ) for @xmath62 , the cusps become weak because image merging only occurs for @xmath63 , and the two merging images are faint .    in each figure",
    "we also show , for comparison , an ideal `` gravitational lensing '' light curve fitted and to have the same width at @xmath64 . ] to the light curve for @xmath65 .",
    "note that for @xmath49 ( no cusps present ) or @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , so that the cusps are weak ) there is considerable similarity between the gravitational lensing and gaseous lensing light curves .",
    "for purposes of discussion , we adopt the @xmath68 polytropic model ( with @xmath69 ) as a guide . for @xmath70",
    "we obtain amplifications @xmath71 for @xmath72 ( see fig .  [",

    "fiedler et al . ( 1994 ) report 9 eses in 594 source - years of monitoring .",
    "two events ( 0954 + 658 and 1749 + 096 , with durations @xmath73 ) have radio light curves suggestive of lensing by the ionized atmosphere of a spherical cloud , implying a rate @xmath74 per source , and a `` covering factor '' @xmath75 . if the plasma envelope extends to @xmath76 , then from the 0.35yr duration of the radio events we estimate @xmath77 .",
    "the neutral cloud covering factor would then be @xmath78 , and the rate per source of optical lensing events with @xmath79 is _ ol ( 0.1r / 1.5r ) _",
    "ese210 ^ -4 ^-1  .",
    "[ eq : pdot_ol ] the optical light curve would have a characteristic time scale @xmath80 days , short compared to the observed lensing events toward the lmc ( alcock et al . 1997 ) , but within the detectable range : with an effective exposure of @xmath81 source - years the absence of @xmath82 day events exceeding the @xmath83 macho threshold implies an upper limit of @xmath84 , 100 times smaller than @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdot_ol ] ) ! we can therefore exclude the possibility that the typical cloud can produce amplifications @xmath86 : the gas clouds associated with eses must have @xmath58 for @xmath87 .",

    "[ eq : limscrit ]      if the clouds are at a typical distance of @xmath88 and contribute a covering fraction @xmath89 ( see above ) , the total mass in clouds should not exceed @xmath0 : m 110 ^ -5(r/)^2  .",
    "[ eq : limmtot ] a third requirement is that the gravitational binding energy of gas particles near the surface exceed the thermal kinetic energy per particle for plausible surface temperature @xmath90 : m 610 ^ -5(r/ )  .",
    "[ eq : limtx ] these 3 conditions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : forbid ] .",
    "we see that the parameters favored by ww98 ",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92  are ruled out by both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : limscrit ] ) and ( [ eq : limmtot ] ) .",
    "however , an allowed region does remain , including @xmath93 , @xmath94 .      for @xmath95 ( _ i.e. _ , no cusps )",
    ", light curves for spherical gaseous lenses bear considerable similarity to light curves for gravitational lensing . as a consequence , it would not be trivial to distinguish gravitational lensing from gaseous lensing purely on the basis of optical light curves , particularly since departures from ideal gravitational lensing of point sources by point masses are anticipated due to blending with other stars , lensing by stars with planetary or stellar companions , and sources of finite angular extent .",
    "the most conspicuous difference in the light curves is the fact that gaseous lensing always has a range of @xmath32 values for which @xmath96 , unlike gravitational lensing .",
    "accurate photometry could either detect such deamplification , or place a limit on it .",
    "note that for lenses with @xmath97 the deamplification is very slight : for example , for @xmath68 and @xmath49 , @xmath98 .",
    "thus accurate photometry would be required to either detect such deamplification or obtain a useful limit .",
    "the cold molecular gas will be nearly transparent at infrared and optical frequencies , but could be detected through h@xmath7 absorption lines .",
    "the characteristic h@xmath7 column density is n()210 ^ 25 ( ) ( ) ^2 ^ -2 .",
    "[ eq : nh2typ ] the @xmath2 will be mainly in the @xmath99 and @xmath100 levels .",
    "quadrupole vibrational absorption lines out of these two levels are listed in table [ tab : h2lines ] , with line - center absorption cross sections @xmath101 computed neglecting pressure broadening and assuming only thermal broadening at @xmath102 . for the estimated column densities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nh2typ ] ) we see that the 1 - 0 transitions would have central optical depths @xmath103 .",
    "while the overtone transitions are weaker , the increased stellar brightness near @xmath104 plus sensitive ccd detectors may make the 3 - 0 transitions best to use .",
    "detection of these absorption features would both confirm the gaseous nature of the lens and determine its radial velocity , expected to be @xmath105 if the lens belongs to the halo as proposed by ww98 .",
    "the optical dispersion results in a slightly larger value of @xmath42 in the blue .",
    "however , noting the similarity in light curves for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath68 , it is clear that changing @xmath42 by 0.8% will be expected to produce only a very slight increase in amplification ( `` blueing '' ) .",
    "if , however , caustics are present in the light curve , the caustics will occur at different times for different colors , which would be detectable with multicolor photometry with good time resolution .",
    "the increased amplification at shorter wavelengths is counteracted by rayleigh scattering , which will redden light passing through the cloud ( ww98 ) .",
    "the rayleigh scattering cross section is @xmath108 , resulting in reddening of a magnified star by @xmath109 , giving @xmath110 for @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nh2typ ] ) .",
    "if the lensed star happened to be bright in the ultraviolet , the gaseous lens would completely block the ultraviolet radiation shortward of @xmath112 through the damping wings of the lyman and werner band transition of @xmath2 , which overlap to form an opaque continuum shortward of @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "since most target stars are far too faint to be detected in the vacuum ultraviolet , however , it seems unlikely that this absorption could be observed .",
    "it is not obvious how cold self - gravitating gas clouds with the properties suggested by ww98 might have formed , or whether such clouds would be stable for @xmath115 .",
    "however , if they do exist , ww98 show that they could solve two longstanding problems : ( 1 ) their ionized envelopes could account for some of the `` extreme scattering events '' ; and ( 2 ) they could contain the `` missing '' baryons in the galaxy .",
    "it is notable that these same clouds could ameliorate a third problem : the fact that microlensing searches detect a larger number of amplification events toward the lmc than expected for lensing by stars and stellar remnants .",
    "some of these events could be due to gaseous lensing .",
    "indeed , lensing by the hypothesized clouds would be so frequent that existing programs to observe gravitational microlensing can already place strong limits on the cloud parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : forbid ] ) , but clouds with @xmath93 and @xmath94 are still allowed .    with a predicted lensing rate @xmath116 , the typical lens must be weak , with @xmath58 .",
    "the distribution of cloud properties and distances could produce occasional strong gaseous lensing events with @xmath117 , perhaps accounting for some of the events attributed to gravitational microlensing .    for non - caustic lensing",
    ", the dispersive effects of the gas would produce slightly larger amplification in the blue , but this is counteracted by rayleigh scattering by the @xmath2 .",
    "a number of quadrupole lines of @xmath2 would be detectable in absorption during the lensing event ; this would be the most unambiguous signature of `` gaseous lensing '' .",
    "existing programs to observe gravitational lensing , supplemented by spectroscopy during lensing events , can therefore be used to either detect gaseous lensing events or place limits on the number of @xmath118 @xmath2 clouds in the galaxy .",
