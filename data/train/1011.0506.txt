    "we let @xmath0 denote @xmath1 observed @xmath2-dimensional observations , where the number of variables @xmath2 is very large relative to @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in the analysis of microarray gene - expression data , @xmath1 ( the number of tissues ) might be only 50 , whereas @xmath2 ( the number of genes ) might be in the tens of thousands .",
    "we follow the traditional biologists practice of letting @xmath3 be the @xmath4 data matrix .",
    "the usual statistical practice is to take the transpose of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as the data matrix . without loss of generality , we assume that the overall mean of @xmath5 is zero .    in most statistical analyses of the data matrix @xmath5 , some form of dimension reduction is required , typically before the primary analysis is performed , or with some approaches it might be done in conjunction with the main analysis . in recent times , much attention has been given to matrix factorizations of the form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a @xmath9 matrix and @xmath10 is a @xmath11 matrix and where @xmath12 is chosen to be much smaller than @xmath2 . for a specified value of @xmath12 ,",
    "the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath10 are chosen to minimize @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the frobenius norm ( the sum of squared elements of the matrix ) . with this factorization , dimension reduction is effected by replacing the data matrix @xmath5 by the solution @xmath15 for the factor matrix @xmath10 ; the @xmath16th row of @xmath15 gives the values of the @xmath16th metavariable for the @xmath1 entities .",
    "thus the original @xmath2 variables are replaced by @xmath12 metavariables .",
    "when the elements of @xmath5 are nonnegative , we can restrict the elements of @xmath8 and @xmath10 to be nonnegative .",
    "this approach is called nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) in the literature ( lee and seung , 1999 ) .",
    "we shall call the general approach where there are no constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath10 , gmf ( general matrix factorization ) .",
    "the classic method for factoring the data matrix @xmath5 is singular - value decomposition ( svd , golub and van loan ( 1983 ) ) .",
    "it follows from this theorem that we can decompose @xmath5 exactly into the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix with orthonormal columns , @xmath20 is a @xmath21 matrix with orthonormal columns , @xmath22 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the rank of @xmath5 . for any @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the set of rank-@xmath12 @xmath4 matrices ; see , for example , eckart and young ( 1936 ) .",
    "let @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 be the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath31 then on considering the matrix factorization ( [ eq:1 ] ) of @xmath5 , it follows from ( [ eq:4 ] ) that for a specified value of @xmath12 we can find the factor matrices @xmath8 and @xmath10 that minimize ( [ eq:2 ] ) by taking @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the calculation of the exact svd of the matrix @xmath5 has time complexity @xmath34 .",
    "hence the use of svd for high - dimensional data sets is not feasible and the use of the best @xmath12-approximation ( [ eq:4 ] ) for @xmath12 larger enough to capture most of the variance in @xmath5 requires essentially the same amount of time as the full svd .",
    "hence we consider a very fast approach to the general matrix factorization ( [ eq:1 ] ) , using a gradient - based algorithm applicable for an arbitrary ( differentiable ) loss function . in the sequel",
    ", we consider the exponential family of loss functions that include the least - squares loss function ( [ eq:2 ] ) as a limiting case .",
    "the novelty of our algorithm lies in the way that on each global iteration it    * iterates on only a small subset of the elements of the factor matrix @xmath8 with the other factor matrix @xmath10 fixed before reversing their roles ; * loops through all the terms in the objective function , minimizing them individually at a time rather than their total sum ( that is , it adopts a stochastic gradient descent approach ) .",
    "as to be presented in section 3 , our algorithm takes only between 10 and 15 seconds in performing 300 global iterations to provide a @xmath35 rank factorization of a 2000 x 62 data matrix for the colon cancer data set of alon et al .",
    "in contrast , 20 global iterations with non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) for the same task required about 25 minutes .",
    "the effectiveness of our algorithm is to be demonstrated in its application to provide a reduction in the number of genes for use in the formation of classifiers in the supervised classification of five well - known high - dimensional data sets in the bioinformatics literature .",
    "here we consider the factorization of @xmath5 into @xmath36 in the spirit that it has no real importance in and of itself other than as a computationally convenient means for obtaining a reduction in the number of variables .",
    "of course in some situations in practice once the factorization has been made , attention will turn to the interpretability of the metavariables .",
    "the latter consideration has led to much recent interest in the use of nmf in the analysis of data for which the elements are nonnegative .",
    "it constrains the elements of the factor matrices @xmath8 and @xmath10 to be nonnegative , which can be advantageous from the point of view of interpretability .",
    "lee and seung , 1999 ; lee and seung 2001 developed nmf in order to improve upon the interpretability of the svd .",
    "the nonnegativity constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath10 form a whole in a nonsubtractive way . in this way",
    ", nmf is considered as a procedure for learning a parts - based representation ( lee and seung , 1999 ) . however , as pointed out in li et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the additive parts by nmf are not necessarily localized .",
    "this led them to propose a subspace method , called local nonnegative matrix factorization ( lnmf ) for learning spatially localized , parts - based representation of visual patterns ; see also ( donoho et al . , 2004 ; gao et al . , 2005",

    "they also consider algorithms in which the basis vectors of @xmath8 are constrained to be convex combinations of the data points .",
    "in other work , witten et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have proposed a penalized matrix decomposition for computing a @xmath12-rank approximation to @xmath5 .",
    "we now describe our gradient - based algorithm for carrying out the general matrix factorization ( [ eq:1 ] ) of the data matrix @xmath5 . the objective function to be minimized",
    "is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the loss function assumed to be differentiable with derivative denoted by @xmath40 . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we take @xmath39 to be a member of the exponential family of loss functions given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a regularization parameter .",
    "note that a squared loss function may be regarded as a marginal limit in relation to this family of loss functions since @xmath43 in our initial experiments nikulin and mclachlan ( 2009 ) , we tried a range of values between 0.003 and 0.004 for @xmath42 , which gave similar results as for the squared loss function .",

    "the algorithm loops through all the differences @xmath63 , minimizing them as a function of the elements of the two factor matrices @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "if the optimization were to be performed by fixing on @xmath10 and solving the optimization with respect to @xmath8 and then reversing the roles of the variables with the intention to iterate until convergence , there can be difficulties with convergence given that the two factor matrices are completely unconstrained .",
    "we circumvent this problem by iterating on only some of the elements of @xmath8 before iterating on some of the elements of @xmath10 .",
    "this partial updating of @xmath8 before a switch to a partial updating of @xmath10 is very effective and is responsible for the very fast convergence of the process .",
    "this procedure of role reversal between the elements of the two factors matrices after only partial updating of their elements has been used effectively in the context of a recommender system ; see , for example paterek ( 2007 ) and , more recently , koren ( 2009 ) , who used factorization techniques to predict users preferences for movies on the netflix prize data set .",
    "it is noted that in the case of the squared loss function , we can optimise the value of the step - size .",
    "however , taking into account the complexity of the model , we recommend maintaining fixed and small values of the step size or learning rate . in all our experiments we applied our algorithm using 100 global iterations with the following regulation parameters .",

    "the other cancer data sets ( leukaemia and lymphoma ) are to be described in the next section .",
    "as pointed out in the introductory section , our algorithm takes only between 10 and 15 seconds in performing 300 global iterations to provide a @xmath35 rank factorization of this data matrix compared to around 25 minutes to perform 20 global iterations with non - negative matrix factorization .",
    "we used a linux computer with speed 3.2ghz , ram 16 gb with the algorithm using special code written in c ) .",
    "in the sequel , we focus on the performance of gmf in its application to some data sets in the context of supervised classification ( discriminant analysis ) . in this latter context",
    ", we have an obvious criterion to guide in the choice of the number @xmath12 of metavariables , namely the estimated error rate of the classifier .    concerning suitable estimates for the error rate of a classifier , we introduce the following notation .",
    "it is assumed that the observed data points @xmath69 come from @xmath70 possible classes , @xmath71 , with known class labels specified by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and where @xmath74 is a @xmath70-dimensional vector of zeros or ones with its @xmath16th element , @xmath75 , defined to be one if @xmath76 comes from class @xmath77 , and zero otherwise @xmath78 .",
    "for the allocation of an observation @xmath79 to one of the @xmath70 possible classes , we let @xmath80 be a classifier formed from the training data @xmath5 with its known class labels in @xmath72 , where @xmath81 equal to @xmath16 implies that @xmath79 is assigned to class @xmath82 .",
    "we shall henceforth abbreviate @xmath80 to @xmath83 also , we let @xmath84 denote an estimate of the error rate of @xmath85 , where dependency of this estimate on @xmath72 is also suppressed for brevity of expression . if we use , for example , @xmath1-fold cross - validation ( that is , the leave - one - out estimate ) , then @xmath86 , \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath87 $ ] is defined to be equal to 1 if @xmath88 , and zero otherwise and where @xmath89 denotes @xmath5 with @xmath76 deleted . finally , we let @xmath90 denote the solution for @xmath10 when gmf is applied to @xmath5 for a specified value of @xmath12 .    in the case where the full data matrix @xmath5 is replaced by the reduced matrix @xmath90 computed for a specified @xmath12 , we can use ( [ eq:6 ] ) to estimate the expected error rate of the classifier formed from this reduced set .",
    "an estimate is given by @xmath91 , \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the @xmath93th column of @xmath90 and @xmath94 denotes @xmath90 with its @xmath93th column @xmath92 deleted .",
    "as pointed out by ambroise and mclachlan ( 2002 ) , this estimate will provide an optimistic assessment of the true error rate of the classifier , since the reduced data matrix @xmath90 should be recomputed on each fold of the cross - validation ; that is , in the right - hand side of ( [ eq:7 ] ) , @xmath95 should be replaced by @xmath96 , the reduced data matrix obtained by applying the gmf algortihm to @xmath89 , the data matrix @xmath5 with its @xmath93th column deleted .",
    "this estimate can be written as @xmath97 , \\label{eq:9}\\ ] ]    in order to calculate this estimated error rate with @xmath1-fold cross - validation , it means that the gmf algorithm has to be run @xmath1 times in addition to its replication to the full data set .",
    "this is feasible given the speed with which the algorithm carries out the gmf .",
    "it should be pointed out that since the gmf does not make use of the known class labels , the selection bias of the classifier based on the selected subset of metavariables @xmath98 will not be nearly as great in magnitude as with selection methods that use the class labels .",
    "also , in practice , @xmath1-fold cross validation can produce an estimate with too much variability and so five- or ten - fold cross validation is often used in a variance versus bias tradeoff ( ambroise and mclachlan , 2002 ) .",
    "we can choose the final value of @xmath12 by taking it to be the value @xmath99 that minimizes the estimated error rate @xmath100 ; @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the set of values considered for @xmath12 .",
    "however , there is still a selection bias if we use @xmath103 , \\label{eq:9a}\\ ] ] to estimate the error rate of the classifier based on the reduced set with the smallest error rate over the values of @xmath12 considered ; see , for example , ( wood et al . , 2007 ; zhu et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "we can correct for this bias by using the estimate @xmath104 , \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] where @xmath105}{n-1 } , \\label{eq:11}\\ ] ] and @xmath106 denotes the data matrix @xmath5 with @xmath76 and @xmath107 deleted .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ eq:11 ] ) that in order to calculate the cross - validated estimate ( [ eq:10 ] ) , we need to perform the gmf @xmath108 times in addition to the original application to the full data set @xmath5 .",
    "this is still feasible since gmf can be implemented so quickly , although the total computational time becomes large as @xmath1 increases . as noted above ,",
    "using , say , ten - fold cross - validation would reduce the number of times that gmf has to be employed . in the data sets considered here , the increase in the estimated error rate given by the use of @xmath109 over ( [ eq:9a ] ) was very small ( not of practical significance ) .",
    "we shall demonstrate the application of the gmf for dimension reduction in the context of supervised classification of five cancer data sets that have been commonly analysed in the bioinformatics literature , as briefly described in the following section .      for the colon data set ( alon et al . , 1999 )",
