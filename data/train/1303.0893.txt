    "in the recently discovered iron - based superconductors @xcite , the superconducting temperatures are found to be in close proximity to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and a tetragonal - orthorhombic ( t - o ) structural transitions .",
    "it turns out that the suppression of both the afm and the t - o structural transitions , by doping or by pressure , eventually induces superconductivity .",
    "these phenomena beg the question about the role of spin and lattice degrees - of - freedom in the emergence of superconductivity@xcite .",
    "several theoretical descriptions have been proposed to interpret the relationship between the structural and afm transitions on the basis of orbital ordering or by introducing an intermediate spin - nematic phase resulting from an effective @xmath11 local - spin model or from an itinerant model both with equivalent consequences.@xcite although different in details , these descriptions emphasize the importance of the magnetoelastic coupling in driving the two transitions simultaneously or separately .",

    "@xcite studied the interplay between the elastic and spin degrees - of - freedom in iron pnictide superconductors using a ginzburg - landau approach , indicating that the magnetoelastic coupling can bring about the particular features of the structural and magnetic transitions in these systems including the emergence of the collinear stripe - type afm ordering .",
    "recently , a microscopic study @xcite of a simple symmetry - allowed model hamiltonian demonstrated that due to the effect of magnetoelastic coupling , the considerable orthorhombic elastic softening is caused by critical spin fluctuations present in the system before magnetic order occurs .",
    "this may explain why the afm transition is often preceded by the t - o structural transition .",
    "it should be pointed out that this picture is similar to the nematic phase model@xcite . to date",

    "however , the tendency of these crystals to form twinned orthorhombic domains has hampered definitive determination of inherent features of the intermediate phase between _",

    "therefore , there have been extensive efforts to de - twin these crystals @xcite to establish the underlying electronic , structural , and magnetic anisotropies that characterize this intermediate phase .",

    "we therefore adopted a standard convolution method by systematically folding a gaussian resolution function and a lorentzian function that reflects an exponentially decaying charge ( chemical ) coherence length as follows ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fwhm of the gaussian and lorentzian functions in reciprocal space , respectively .",
    "our resolution was high enough to resolve the twin domains separately , i.e. , optimizing peak intensity of the ( 208)@xmath10 from one twin domain and that of the ( 028)@xmath10 of the other domain required sample rotation between the two peaks as has been done for cefeaso@xcite .",
    "while the fwhm of the lorentzian function ( @xmath44 ) represents the intrinsic width @xmath45 of the sample , we should note that the gaussian function in eq .",

    "it is by now well established that the mosaic spread of typical pnictides undergoing shear induced o - t transition exhibit mosaic spread changes due to stresses during the transitions .",
    "we therefore attribute the temperature dependence of the gaussian width as arising primarily from the variation in the mosaic distributions .",

    "there are two kinds of simple antiphase domains ( labeled a and b ) with boundaries along @xmath5 and @xmath7 axes , as shown in fig .",
    "due to the same magnetoelastic interactions that lead to a difference in the ferromagnetic and afm bond lengths in the orthorhombic structure , we propose that the formation of such antiphase domains are accompanied by elastic distortions at their boundaries .",
    "the antiphase boundaries along @xmath5 axis influence the magnitude of transverse charge correlation length @xmath8 , whereas the antiphase boundaries along @xmath7 axis affect the longitudinal charge correlation length @xmath6 .",
