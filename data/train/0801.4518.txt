    "these compounds crystallize in the tetragonal structure with the space group _ p4/mmm_. some of their interesting features are : a crystal field split nonmagnetic doublet ground state of pr@xmath8 ions in pr@xmath0coin@xmath1 , field induced ferromagnetic behavior at low temperatures in dy@xmath0coin@xmath1 and ho@xmath0coin@xmath1 and an anomalously high magnetoresistance ( @xmath9  2700  % ) at 2  k in tb@xmath0coin@xmath1 . considering these interesting behaviors in the indium analogs , and to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no reports on the corresponding gallium compounds , we decided to study the r@xmath0coga@xmath1 for various rare earths . here",
    "we report on our detailed structural and magnetization studies in this series of single crystals .",
    "single crystals of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 ( r = rare earths ) compounds were grown by the flux method .",
    "the starting materials used for the preparation of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 single crystals were high purity metals of rare - earths ( 99.95% ) , co ( 99.9% ) and ga ( 99.999% ) .",
    "owing to the low melting point of ga , the single crystals were grown in ga flux .",
    "considering the great affinity of co and ga atoms to form coga@xmath10 , we decided to make r@xmath0co button by arc melting and use it with excess ga flux . from the binary phase diagram of r - co we found that r@xmath0co phase does not exist , so the melt formed will have arbitrary phases which are assumed to remain unstable in presence of ga within the required temperature range . from the previous studies",
    "@xcite , it was observed that the r@xmath0coin@xmath1 crystals were grown in the temperature range between 750 and 450  @xmath11c .",
    "we have also employed the same temperature range for the growth of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 compounds . a button of r@xmath0co with excess of ga ( r : co : ga = 2:1:27 )",
    "was taken in an alumina crucible and then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule .",
    "the ampoule was then heated up to 1050  @xmath11c over a period of 24 hours and held at this temperature for 24 hours , so that the melt becomes homogeneous .",
    "the furnace was then cooled very rapidly down to 750  @xmath11c to avoid the formation of any unwanted phase . from 750 to 400  @xmath11c the furnace was cooled down at the rate of 1  @xmath11c / h , followed by a fast cooling to room temperature . the crystals were separated by centrifuging and as well treating them in hot water .",
    "the crystals obtained were platelets of size roughly 5  @xmath12  1  mm@xmath13 . in some of the cases the small platelets stick together to form a big crystal ( roughly 7  @xmath12   4 mm@xmath13 ) .",
    "an energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edax ) was performed on all the obtained single crystals to identify their phase .",

    "the r@xmath0coga@xmath1 phase forms only for heavier rare earths ( gd , tb , dy , ho , er , tm and lu , y ) . our attempts to make the compound with lighter rare earths failed . we did not attempt to make yb and eu compounds .",
    "it was found that in all the cases the crystallographic ( 001 ) plane was perpendicular to the flat plates of the crystal .",
    "the crystals were oriented along the crystallographic axis [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] using laue x - ray diffractometer , and cut along the principal directions for the purpose of magnetization measurements by spark erosion cutting machine .",

    "a rietveld analysis of the observed x - ray pattern of all the compounds was done .",

    "this is attributed to the well known lanthanide contraction . the _ ( c / a ) _ ratio remains constant ( @xmath4  2.6 ) for all the compounds but it is slightly less than that of the corresponding in compounds ( @xmath4  2.63 ) . the large _ ( c / a ) _ ratio indicates the significant structural anisotropy in these compounds .",

    "in fact , the lattice constant @xmath14 of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 phase is approximately equal to that of the rga@xmath10 ( cubic ) phase  @xcite and the remaining structure above and below it forms the coga@xmath0 layers .",
    "the unit cell of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 may be viewed as formed by the stacking of rga@xmath10 units and coga@xmath0 layer alternately along the _ c _ axis .",

    "gd is on the borderline of stability which forms the r@xmath0coga@xmath1 phase but not the rga@xmath10 phase  @xcite .",

    "hence the non formation of rga@xmath10 phase with lighter rare earths is one of the possible reasons for the non formation of the corresponding r@xmath0coga@xmath1 compounds .",

    "these data show conclusively the nature of non - magnetic co atoms in this series of compounds .",
    "the diamagnetic behavior of y@xmath0coga@xmath1 and lu@xmath0coga@xmath1 is in contrast with the pauli - paramagnetic behavior shown by the non magnetic indide y@xmath0coin@xmath1 and indicates a low density of electronic density of states at the fermi level in the gallides , such that the diamagnetic contribution due to the filled electronic shells exceeds the pauli paramagnetic contribution from the conduction electrons .",
    "indeed , the co - efficient of the electronic heat capacity ( @xmath22 ) , which is proportional to the density of states at the fermi level , of y@xmath0coga@xmath1 is ( 2  mj / k@xmath23mol , comparably less than that of y@xmath0coin@xmath1  @xcite ( 13  mj / k@xmath23mol ) .",
    "if the density of states at the fermi level decreases on replacing in by ga in these r@xmath0cox@xmath1 ( x = in and ga ) series of compounds , it should result in a weaker conduction electron mediated rkky magnetic interactions between the rare earth ions in r@xmath0coga@xmath1 compounds .",
    "this may be one of the reasons that the nel temperatures of r@xmath0coga@xmath1 series of compounds are lower than those of the corresponding indides r@xmath0coin@xmath1 .",
