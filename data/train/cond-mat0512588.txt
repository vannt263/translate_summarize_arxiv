    "stochastic many - body processes have long been of interest to physicists , largely from applications in condensed matter and chemical physics , such as surface growth , the aggregation of structures , reaction dynamics or pattern formation in systems far from equilibrium . through these studies ,",
    "statistical physicists have acquired a range of analytical and numerical techniques along with insights into the macroscopic phenomena that arise as a consequence of noise in the dynamics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that physicists have begun to use these methods to explore emergent phenomena in the wider class of _ complex _ systems which  in addition to stochastic interactions  might invoke a _ selection _ mechanism . in particular , this can lead to a system adapting to its environment .    the best - known process in which selection plays an important part is , of course , biological evolution .",
    "more generally , one can define an evolutionary dynamics as being the interplay between three processes .",
    "in addition to selection , one requires _ replication _ ( e.g. , of genes ) to sustain a population and _ variation _",
    "( e.g. , mutation ) so that there is something to select on .",
    "a generalized evolutionary theory has been formalized by biologist and philosopher of science david hull @xcite that includes as special cases both biological and cultural evolution .",
    "the latter of these describes , for example , the propagation of ideas and theories through the scientific community , with those theories that are `` fittest '' ( perhaps by predicting the widest range of experimental results ) having a greater chance of survival . within this generalized evolutionary framework",
    ", a theory of language change has been developed @xcite which we examine from the point of view of statistical physics in this paper .",
    "since it is unlikely that the reader versed in statistical physics is also an expert in linguistics , we spend some time in the next section outlining this theory of language change . then , our formulation of a very simple _ mathematical _ model of language change that we define in sec .",
    "[ moddef ] should seem rather natural . as this is not the only evolutionary approach that has been taken to the problem of language change , we provide  again , for the nonspecialist reader  a brief overview of relevant modeling work one can find in the literature .",
    "the remainder of this paper is then devoted to a mathematical analysis of our model .",
    "a particular feature of this model is that all speakers continuously vary their speech patterns according to utterances they hear from other speakers . since in our model ,",
    "the utterances produced represent a finite - sized sample of an underlying distribution , the language changes over time even in the absence of an explicit selection mechanism .",
    "this process is similar to _ genetic drift _ that occurs in biological populations when the individuals chosen to produce offspring in the next generation are chosen entirely at random .",
    "our model also allows for language change by selection as well as drift ( see sec .",
    "[ moddef ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we describe the model as the `` utterance selection model '' @xcite .",
    "as it happens , the mathematics of our model of language change turn out to be almost identical to those describing classical models in population genetics .",
    "this we discover from a fokker - planck equation for the evolution of the language , the derivation of which is given in sec .",
    "consequently , we have surveyed the existing literature on these models , and by doing so obtained a number of new results which we outline in sec .  [ singlespeaker ] and whose detailed derivation can be found elsewhere @xcite . since in the language context",
    ", these results pertain to the rather limiting case of a single speaker ",
    "which is nevertheless nontrivial because speakers monitor their own language use  we extend this in sec .",
    "[ multispeaker ] to a wider speech community . in all cases we concentrate on properties indicative of change , such as the probability that certain forms of language fall into disuse , or the time it takes for them to do so . establishing these basic facts is an important step towards realizing our future aims of making a meaningful comparison with observational data .",
    "we outline such scope for future work and discuss our results in the concluding section .",
    "in order to model language change we focus on _ linguistic variables _ , which are essentially `` different ways of saying the same thing '' .",
    "examples include the pronunciation of a vowel sound , or an ordering of words according to their function in the sentence . in order to recognize change when it occurs",
    ", we will track the frequencies with which distinct _",
    "variants _ of a particular linguistic variable are reproduced in _",
    "utterances _ by a language s _ speakers_. let us assume that amongst a given group of speakers , one particular variant form is reproduced with a high frequency .",
    "this variant we shall refer to as the _ convention _ among that group of speakers . now , it may be that , over time , an unconventional  possibly completely new  variant becomes more widely used amongst this group of speakers .",
    "clearly one possibility here is that by becoming the most frequently used variant , it is established as the new convention at the expense of the existing one .",
    "it is this competition between variant forms , and particularly the propagation of innovative forms across the speech community , that we are interested in .",
    "we have so far two important ingredients in this picture of language change : the speakers , and the utterances they produce .",
    "the object relating a speaker to her utterances we call a _",
    "grammar_. more precisely , a speaker s grammar contains the entirety of her knowledge of the language .",
    "we assume this to depend on the frequencies she has heard particular variant forms used within her speech community @xcite . in turn , grammars govern the variants that are uttered by speakers , and how often .",
    "clearly , a `` real - world '' grammar must be an extremely complicated object , encompassing a knowledge of many linguistic variables , their variant forms and their suitability for a particular purpose .",
    "however , it is noticed that even competent speakers ( i.e. , those who are highly aware of the various conventions among different groups ) might use unconventional variants if they have become _ entrenched _ @xcite .",
    "for example , someone who has lived for a long time in one region may continue to use parts of the dialect of that region after moving to a completely new area .",
    "this fact will impact on our modeling in two ways .",
    "first , we shall assume that a given interaction ( conversation ) between two speakers has only a small effect on the established grammar .",
    "second , speakers will reinforce their own way of using language by keeping a record of their own utterances .",
    "another observed feature of language use is that there is considerable variation , not just from speaker to speaker but also in the utterances of a single speaker .",
    "there are various proposals for the origin of this variation . on the one hand",
    ", there is evidence for certain variants to be favored due to universal forces of language change .",
    "for instance articulatory and acoustic properties of sounds , or syntactic processing factors  which are presumed common to all speakers  favor certain phonetic or syntactic changes over others @xcite .",
    "these universals can be recognized through a high frequency of such changes occurring across many speech communities .",
    "on the other hand , variation could reflect the wide range of possible intentions a speaker could have in communicative enterprise .",
    "for example , a particular non - conventional choice of variant might arise from the desire not to be misunderstood , or to impress , flatter or amuse the listener @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in a recent analysis of language use with a common goal @xcite , it was observed that variation is present in nearly all utterances .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that variation arises primarily as a consequence of the fact that no two situations are exactly alike , nor do speakers construe a particular situation in exactly the same way . hence there is a fundamental indeterminacy to the communicative process . as a result",
    ", speakers produce variant forms for the same meaning being communicated .",
    "these forms are words or constructions representing possibly novel combinations , and occasionally completely novel utterances . given the large number of possible sources of variation and innovation , we feel it appropriate to model these effects using a stochastic prescription .    in order to complete the evolutionary description , we require a mechanism that selects an innovative variant for subsequent propagation across the speech community . in the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite it is proposed that social forces play this role .",
    "this is based on the observation that speakers want to identify with certain subgroups of a society , and do so in part by preferentially producing the variants produced by members of the emulated subgroup @xcite .",
    "that is , the preference of speakers to produce variants associated with certain social groups acts as a selection mechanism for those variants .",
    "this particular evolutionary picture of language change ( see sec .  [",
    "compare ] for contrasting approaches ) places an emphasis on utterances ( perhaps more so than on the speakers ) .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite the utterance is taken as the linguistic analog of dna .",
    "as speakers reproduce utterances , linguistic structures get passed on from generation to generation ( which one might define as a particular time interval ) .",
    "for this reason , the term _ lingueme _ has been coined in @xcite to refer to these structures , and to emphasize the analogy with genetics .",
    "one can then extend to analogy to identify linguistic variables with a particular _ gene locus _ and variant forms with _",
    "alleles_.    we stress , however , that the analogy between this evolutionary formulation of language change and biological evolution is not exact .",
    "the distinction is particularly clear when one views the two theories in the more general framework of hull @xcite .",
    "the two relevant concepts are _ interactors _ and _ replicators _ whose roles are played in the biological system by individual organisms and genes respectively . in biology ,",
    "a replicator ( a gene ) `` belongs to '' an interactor ( an organism ) , thereby influencing its survival and reproductive ability of the interactor .",
    "this is then taken as the dominant force governing the make - up of the population of replicators in the next generation .",
    "the survivability of a replicator is not due to an inherent `` fitness '' : it is the organism whose fitness leads to the differential survival or extinction of replicators .",
    "also , the relationship between genotype and phenotype is indirect and complex .",
    "nevertheless , there is a sufficient correlation between genes and phenotypic traits of organisms such that the differential survival of the latter causes the differential survival of the former ( this is hull s definition of `` selection '' ) , but the correlation is not a simple one .    in the linguistic theory outlined here , the interactors ( speakers ) and replicators ( linguemes ) have quite different relationships to one another .",
    "the replicators are uttered by speakers , and there is no one - to - one relationship between a replicator ( a lingueme ) and the speaker who produces it .",
    "nevertheless , hull s generalized theory of selection can be applied to the lingueme as replicator and the speaker as interactor .",
    "linguemes and lingueme variation is generated by speaker intercourse , just as new genotypes are generated by sexual intercourse .",
    "the generation process is replication , that is , speakers are replicating sounds , words and construction they have heard before .",
    "finally , the differential survival of the speakers , that is , their social `` success '' , causes the differential survival of the linguemes they produce , and so the social mechanisms underlying the propagation of linguistic variants conforms to hull s definition of selection .",
    "in short , we do not suppose that the language uttered by an interactor has any effect on its survival , believing the dominant effects on language change to be social in origin .",
    "that is , the survivability of a replicator is not due to any inherent _ fitness _ , but arises instead from the social standing of individuals associated with the use of the corresponding variant form .",
    "it is therefore necessary that in formulating a mathematical model of language change , one should not simply adapt an existing biological theory , but start from first principles .",
    "this is the program we now follow .",
    "the utterance selection model comprises a set of rules that govern the evolution of the simplest possible language viewed from the perspective of the previous section .",
    "this language has a single lingueme with a restricted number @xmath0 variant forms . at present",
    "we simply assume the existence of multiple variants of a lingueme : modeling the the communicative process and the means by which indeterminacy in communication ( see sec .  [ framework ] ) leads to the generation of variation is left for future work .",
    "in the speech community we have @xmath1 individuals , each of whose knowledge of the language  the grammar  is encoded in the set @xmath2 of variables @xmath3 . in a manner shortly to be defined precisely , the variable @xmath3 reflects speaker @xmath4 s ( @xmath5 ) perception of the frequency with which lingueme variant @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is used in the speech community at time @xmath8 . at all times",
    "these variables are normalized so that the sum over all variants for each speaker is unity , that is @xmath9 for convenience we will sometimes use a vector notation @xmath10 to denote the entirety of speaker @xmath4 s grammar .",
    "the state of the system @xmath2 at time @xmath8 is then the aggregation of grammars @xmath11 .    after choosing some initial condition ( e.g. , a random initial condition )",
    ", we allow the system to evolve by repeatedly iterating the following three steps in sequence , each iteration having duration @xmath12 .    _",
    "1 . social interaction . _ a pair @xmath13 of speakers is chosen with a ( prescribed ) probability @xmath14 .",
    "there is no notion of an ordering of a particular pair of speakers in this model , and so we implicitly have @xmath15 , normalized such that the sum over _ distinct _",
    "pairs @xmath16 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig - society ] .",
    "speakers in the society interact with different frequencies ( shown here schematically by different thicknesses of lines connecting them ) .",
    "the pair of speakers @xmath13 is chosen to interact with probability @xmath14 . ]",
    "_ both the speakers selected in step 1 produce a set of @xmath17 _ tokens _ , i.e. , instances of lingueme variants . each token is produced independently and at random , with the probability that speaker @xmath4 utters variant @xmath6 equal to the _ production probability _ @xmath18 which will be determined in one of two ways ( see below ) .",
    "the numbers of tokens @xmath19 of each variant are then drawn from the multinomial distribution @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and where we have dropped the explicit time dependence to lighten the notation .",
    "speaker @xmath24 produces a sequence of tokens according to the same prescription , with the obvious replacement @xmath25 .",
    "the randomness in this step is intended to model the observed variation in language use that was described in the previous section .",
    "the first , and simplest possible prescription for obtaining the reproduction probabilities is simply to assign @xmath26 . since the grammar is a function of the speaker s experience of language use  the next step explains precisely how  this reproduction rule does not invoke any favoritism towards any particular variants on behalf of the speaker .",
    "we therefore refer to this case as _ unbiased _ reproduction , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - unbiased ] .     both speakers @xmath4 and @xmath24 produce an utterance , with particular lingueme variants appearing with a frequency given by the value stored in the utterer s grammar when no production biases are in operation . in this particular case",
    "three variants are shown ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and the number of tokens , @xmath17 , is equal to 6 . ]",
    "we shall also study a _ biased _ reproduction model , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - biased ] . here , the reproduction probabilities are a linear transformation of the grammar frequencies , i.e. , @xmath29 in which the matrix @xmath30 must have column sums of unity so that the production probabilities are properly normalized .",
    "this matrix @xmath30 is common to all speakers , which would be appropriate if one is considering effects of universal forces ( such as articulatory considerations ) on language .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the unbiased case , this reproduction model admits the possibility of innovation , i.e. , the production of variants that appear with zero frequency in a speaker s grammar .     in the biased reproduction model ,",
    "the probability of uttering a particular variant is a linear combination @xmath30 of the values stored in the grammar . ]",
    "_ 3 . retention .",
    "_ the final step is to modify each speaker s grammar to reflect the actual language used in the course of the interaction .",
    "the simplest approach here is to add to the existing speaker s grammar additional contributions which reflect both the tokens produced by her and by her interlocutor .",
    "the weight given to these tokens , relative to the existing grammar , is given by a parameter @xmath31 .",
    "meanwhile , the weight , relative to her own utterances , that speaker @xmath4 gives to speaker @xmath24 s utterances is specified by @xmath32 .",
    "this allows us to implement the social forces mentioned in the previous section .",
    "these considerations imply that @xmath33\\ ] ] for speaker @xmath4 , and the same rule for speaker @xmath24 after exchanging all @xmath4 and @xmath24 indices .",
    "[ fig - retain ] illustrates this step .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 , which affects how much the grammar changes as a result of the interaction is intended to be small , for reasons given in the previous section .",
    "after the utterances have been produced , both speakers modify their grammars by adding to them the frequencies with which the variants were reproduced in the conversation .",
    "note each speaker retains both her own utterances as well as those of her interlocutor , albeit with different weights . ]",
    "we must also ensure that the normalization ( [ normalize ] ) is maintained .",
    "therefore , @xmath34    although we have couched this model in terms of the grammar variables @xmath3 , we should stress that these are not observable quantities .",
    "really , we should think in terms of the population of utterances produced in a particular generation , e.g. , a time interval @xmath35 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - generation ] .",
    "however , since the statistics of this population can be derived from the grammar variables  indeed , in the absence of production biases they are the same  we shall in the following focus on the latter .",
    "a generation of a population of utterances in the utterance selection model could be defined as the set of tokens produced by all speakers in the macroscopic time interval @xmath36 . ]",
    "evolutionary modeling has a long history in the field of language change and development . indeed , at a number of points in _ the origin of the species _",
    ", charles darwin makes parallels between the changes that occur in biological species and in languages .",
    "particularly , he used our everyday observation that languages tend to change slowly and continuously over time to challenge the then prevailing view that biological species were distinct species , occupying immovable points in the space of all possible organisms .",
    "as evolutionary theories of biology have become more formalized , it is not surprising that these there have been a number of attempts to apply more formal evolutionary ideas to language change ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we describe a few of these studies in order that the reader can see how our approach differs from others one can find in the literature .    one area in which biological evolution plays a part is the development of the capacity to use language ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a brief overview ) .",
    "although this is in itself an interesting topic to study , we do not suppose that this ( presumably ) genetic evolution is strongly related to language change since the latter occurs on much shorter timescales .",
    "for example , the foxp2 gene ( which is believed to play a role in both language production and comprehension ) became fixed around 120,000 years ago @xcite , whereas the patterns in the use of linguistic variables can change over periods as short as tens of years .",
    "given an ability to use language , one can ask how the various linguistic structures ( such as particular aspects of grammar or syntax ) come into being @xcite . here",
    "evolutionary models that place particular emphasis on language _ learning _ are often employed .",
    "some aspects of this type of work are reviewed in @xcite  here we remark that in order to see the emergence of grammatical rules , one must model a grammar at a much finer level than we have done here .",
    "indeed , we have left aside the ( nevertheless interesting ) question of _ how _ an innovation is recognized as `` a different way of saying the same thing '' by all speakers in the community . instead , we assume that this agreement is always reached , and concentrate on the fate of new variant forms .    similar kinds of assumptions have been used in a learning - based context by niyogi and berwick @xcite to study language change . in learning - based models in general ,",
    "the mechanism for language change lies in speakers at an early stage of their life having a ( usually finite ) set of possible grammars to choose from , and use the data presented to them by other speakers to hypothesize the grammar being used to generate utterances .",
    "since these data are finite , there is the possibility for a child listening to language in use to infer a grammar that differs from his parents , and becomes fixed once a speaker reaches maturity .",
    "our model of continuous grammatical change as a consequence of exposure to other speakers at all stages in a speaker s life is quite different to learning - based approaches . in particular",
    ", it assumes an inductive model of language acquisition @xcite , in which the child entertains hypotheses about sets of words and grammatical constructions rather than about entire discrete grammars .",
    "thus , our model does not assume that a child has in her mind a large set of discrete grammars .",
    "the specific model in @xcite assigns grammars ( languages ) to a proportion of the population of speakers in a particular generation .",
    "a particular learning algorithm then implies a mapping of the proportions of speakers using a particular language from one generation to the next .",
    "since one is dealing with nonlinear iterative maps , one can find familiar phenomena such as bifurcations and phase transitions @xcite in the evolution of the language .",
    "note , however , that the dynamics of the population of utterances and speakers are essentially the same in this model , since the only thing distinguishing speakers is grammar . in the utterance selection model , we have divorced the population dynamics of speakers and utterances , and allow the former to be distinguished in terms of their social interactions with other speakers ( which is explicitly ignored in @xcite ) . this has allowed us to take a _ fixed _ population of speakers without necessarily preventing the population of utterances to change . in other words ,",
    "language change may occur if the general structure of a society remains intact as individual speakers are replaced by their offspring , or even during a period of time when there is no change in the makeup of the speaker population ; both of these possibilities are widely observed .",
    "an alternative approach to language change in the learning - based tradition is not to have speakers attempt to infer the grammatical rules underpinning their parents language use , but to select a grammar based on how well it permits them to communicate with other members of the speech community .",
    "this path has been followed most notably by nowak and coworkers in a series of papers ( including @xcite ) as well as by members of the statistical physics community @xcite .",
    "this thinking allows one to borrow the notion of _ fitness _ from biological evolutionary theories  the more people a particular grammar allows you to communicate with , the fitter it is deemed to be . in order for language use to change , speakers using a more coherent grammar selectively produce more offspring than others so that the language as a whole climbs a hill towards maximal coherence .",
    "the differences between this and our way of thinking should be clear from sec .  [ framework ] .",
    "in particular we assume no connection between the language a speaker uses and her biological reproductive fitness . finally on the subject of learning - based models",
    ", we remark that not all of them assume language transmission from parents to offspring .",
    "for example , in @xcite the effects of children also learning from their peers are investigated .",
    "perhaps closer in spirit to our own work are studies that have languages competing for speakers .",
    "the simplest model of this type is due to abrams and strogatz @xcite which deems a language `` attractive '' if it is spoken by many speakers or has some ( prescribed ) added value .",
    "for example , one language might be of greater use in a trading arrangement .",
    "in @xcite good agreement with available data for the number of speakers of minority languages was found , revealing that the survival chances of such languages are typically poor .",
    "more recently , the model has been extended by minett and wang @xcite to implement a structured society and the possibility of bilingualism .",
    "one might view the utterance selection model as being relevant here if the variant forms of a lingueme represent different languages .",
    "however , there are then significant differences in detail . first , the way the utterance selection model is set up",
    "would imply that all languages are mutually intelligible to all speakers .",
    "second , in the models of @xcite , learning a new language is a strategic decision whereas in the utterance selection model it would occur simply through exposure to individuals speaking that language .    to summarize ,",
    "the distinctive feature of our modeling approach is that we consider the dynamics of the population of utterances to be separate from that of the speech community ( if indeed the latter changes at all ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that language propagates purely through exposure with social status being used as a selection process , rather than through some property of the language itself such as coherence .",
    "the purpose of this work is to establish an understanding of the consequences of the assumptions we have made , particularly in those cases where the utterance selection model can be solved exactly .",
    "we begin our analysis of the utterance selection model by constructing a fokker - planck equation via an appropriate continuous - time limit .",
    "there are several ways one could proceed here .",
    "for example , one could scale the interaction probabilities @xmath14 proportional to @xmath12 ( the constant of proportionality then being an interaction rate ) . whilst this would yield a perfectly acceptable continuous time process ,",
    "the fokker - planck equation that results is unwieldy and intractable .",
    "therefore we will not follow this path , but will discuss two other approaches below .",
    "the first will be applicable when the number of tokens is large",
    ". this will not generally be the case , but will serve to motivate the second approach , which is closer to the situation which we are modeling .      to clarify the derivation it is convenient to start with a single speaker which ,",
    "although linguistically trivial , is far from mathematically trivial .",
    "it also has an important correspondence to population dynamics , which is explored in more detail in sec .",
    "[ popgen ] . in this case",
    "there is no matrix @xmath32 , and in fact we can drop the indices @xmath4 and @xmath24 completely .",
    "this means that the update rule ( [ update ] ) takes the simpler form @xmath37 and so @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the derivation of the fokker - planck equation involves the calculation of averages of powers of @xmath40 . using eq .",
    "( [ multinomial ] ) , the average of @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "if we begin by assuming unbiased reproduction , then @xmath43 and so the average of @xmath40 is zero . in the language of stochastic dynamics",
    ", there is no deterministic component  the only contribution is from the diffusion term .",
    "this is characterized by the second moment which is calculated in the appendix to be @xmath44 where the angle brackets represent an average over all possible realizations . to give a contribution to the fokker - planck equation",
    ", the second moment ( [ second_mom ] ) has to be of order @xmath12 .",
    "one way to arrange this is as follows .",
    "we choose the unit of time such that @xmath17 utterances are made in unit time .",
    "thus the time interval between utterances , @xmath45 , is small if @xmath17 is large .",
    "furthermore , although the frequency of a particular variant in an utterance , @xmath46 , varies in steps , the steps are very small .",
    "therefore , when @xmath17 becomes very large , the time and variant frequency steps become very small and can be approximated as continuous variables . the second jump moment , which is actually what appears in the fokker - planck equation ,",
    "is found by dividing the expression ( [ second_mom ] ) by @xmath47 , and letting @xmath48 : @xmath49 since the higher moments of the multinomial distribution involve higher powers of @xmath50 , they give no contribution , and the only non - zero jump moment is given by eq .",
    "( [ second_jump_mom ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , or in standard texts on the theory of stochastic processes @xcite , this gives rise to the fokker - planck equation @xmath51 where we have suppressed the dependence of the probability distribution function @xmath52 on the initial state of the system .",
    "the equation ( [ fpe_1_nobias ] ) holds only for unbiased reproduction .",
    "it can be generalized to biased reproduction by noting that as @xmath53 , this process becomes deterministic .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ delta_x_1 ] ) is replaced by the deterministic equation @xmath54 however , we may write eq .",
    "( [ lintrans ] ) using the condition @xmath55 as @xmath56 the diagonal entries of @xmath30 are omitted in the last line because the condition @xmath55 means that in each column one entry is not independent of the others .",
    "if we choose this entry to be the one with @xmath57 , then all elements of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ bias_deter ] ) are independent . thus the diagonal entries of @xmath30 have no significance ; they are simply given by @xmath58 . from eqs .",
    "( [ delta_x_1_deter ] ) and ( [ bias_deter ] ) we see that in order to obtain a finite limit as @xmath48 , we need to assume that the off - diagonal entries of @xmath30 are of order @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath59 for @xmath60 . then in the limit @xmath48 , @xmath61 deterministic effects such as this give rise to @xmath62 contributions in the derivation of the fokker - planck equation , unlike the @xmath63 contributions arising from diffusion . therefore , the first jump moment in the case of biased reproduction is given by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deter_eqn ] ) .",
    "the second jump moment is still given by eq .",
    "( [ second_jump_mom ] ) , since any additional terms involving @xmath64 are of order @xmath12 and so give terms which vanish in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "this discussion may be straightforwardly extended to the case of many speakers .",
    "the only novel feature is the appearance of the matrix @xmath32 . in order to obtain a deterministic equation of the type ( [ deter_eqn ] )",
    ", a new matrix has to be defined by @xmath65 .",
    "thus , in summary , what could be called the `` large @xmath17 approximation '' is obtained by choosing @xmath47 , and defining new matrices @xmath66 and @xmath67 through @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is the classic way of deriving the fokker - planck equations as the `` diffusion approximation '' to a discrete process .",
    "however , for our purposes it is not a very useful approximation .",
    "this is simply because we do not expect that in realistic situations the number of tokens will be large , so it would be useful to find another way of taking the continuous - time limit .",
    "fortunately , another parameter is present in the model which we have not yet utilized .",
    "this is @xmath31 , which characterizes the small effect that utterances have on the speaker s grammar . if we now return to the case of a single speaker with unbiased reproduction , we see from eq .",

    "[ num_unfixed ] in which the number of unfixed realizations as a function of time obtained from monte carlo simulation is compared with this prediction .",

    "in this paper we have cast a descriptive theory of language change , developed by one of us @xcite , into a mathematical form , specifically as a markovian stochastic process . in the resulting model",
    "there are a set of @xmath1 speakers who each have a grammar which consists of @xmath109 possible variants of a particular linguistic structure ( a lingueme ) . in the initial phase of formulating the process ,",
    "two speakers out of the @xmath1 are picked out at every time step and allowed to communicate with each other .",
    "the utterances they produce modify the grammar of the other speaker  as well as their own  by a small amount .",
    "another two speakers are then picked at the next time step and allowed to communicate .",
    "this process is repeated , with two speakers @xmath4 and @xmath24 being chosen at each time step with a probability @xmath14 .",
    "this matrix therefore prescribes the extent of the social interaction between all speakers .",
    "after many time steps the initial grammar of the speakers will have been modified in a way which depends on the choice of the model parameters .",
    "the above formulation , that is , in terms of events which happen at regular time steps , is ideal for computer simulation . of course , the model is stochastic , and so many independent runs have to be carried out , and the results obtained as averages over these runs .",
    "the randomness in the model enters in two ways : in the choice of speakers @xmath4 and @xmath24 and in the choice of the variants spoken by a speaker in a particular utterance .",
    "we showed that it is possible to take the time interval between steps to zero , and derive a continuous time description of the process .",
    "when this procedure is carried out , the model takes the form of a fokker - planck equation .    the whole approach to language change we have been investigating",
    "was conceived as an evolutionary process , with linguemes being analogous to genes in population genetics .",
    "so it is perhaps not surprising that the mathematical structures encountered when quantifying these theories are so similar .",
    "however , as stressed in sec .",
    "[ popgen ] , there are important differences .",
    "the most direct correspondence with population genetics is when there is a single speaker and where the number of tokens is large .",
    "furthermore , at each time step the update rule ( [ update_1 ] ) applies in the linguistic model , whereas the equivalent rule in the population genetics case would be @xmath261 corresponding to a completely new generation of @xmath90 individuals being created through random mating . thus the genetic counterpart is formally equivalent to letting @xmath262 , and giving the previous grammar ( @xmath263 ) zero weight compared to the random element ( @xmath264 ) ; for the actual linguistic problem , @xmath31 is small , and it is @xmath263 that has by far the greater weight . taking @xmath262 and reinstating the factor of @xmath17 through a rescaling of the time , does indeed give the population genetics result ( [ fwfpe ] ) , with @xmath90 taking the role of @xmath17 .",
    "although the limit @xmath262 is the precise correspondence , the scaling choice ( [ rescale1])([rescale3 ] ) which we use also gives a mathematical , if not a precise conceptual , equivalence between the genetic and linguistic models .",
    "our analysis of the fokker - planck equation began by considering the case of only one speaker .",
    "this is far from trivial , and as we have seen is formally equivalent to standard models of population genetics .",
    "this has the advantage that many results from population genetics may be taken over essentially without change .",
    "remarkably , the fokker - planck equation is in this case exactly soluble .",
    "this is due to the simple way in which the equation for @xmath109 variants is embedded in the @xmath265-variant equation .",
    "a similar simplification holds when calculating quantities such as the probability that a given number of variants coexist at time @xmath8 or the mean time to the @xmath266th extinction of a variant : they can be related by induction to the solution of the two - variant problem .    while the exact solution of the mathematically non - trivial single speaker case gives considerable insights into the effects caused by the bias ( or mutation ) term ( [ lbias ] ) and the diffusion term ( [ lrep ] ) , to understand the evolution of variants across a speech community it is clearly necessary to include the third term ( [ lint ] ) in the fokker - planck equation . in sec .",
    "[ multispeaker ] we carried out an analysis of the model with this term included in the simplest situation where all speakers were equally likely to talk to all other speakers ( @xmath14 independent of @xmath4 and @xmath24 ) and where all speakers gave the same weight to utterances from other speakers ( @xmath106 independent of @xmath4 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "just as for the single speaker case , there are distinctions between the situations where there is bias and where there is no bias . whilst the presence of a bias ( through the term ( [ lbias ] ) ) , makes the model more complicated ,",
    "its behavior is in fact simpler than if there were no bias : the distribution of the probability of a variant in the population tends to a stationary state which can be approximately characterized as a beta distribution . as we have seen , when no bias is present , interactions between the speakers causes them all to converge relatively quickly to a common marginal distribution which persists for a long time until a fluctuation causes the same variant to be fixed in all grammars .",
    "under a mean - field - type approximation , valid in the limit of a large number of speakers , we established the form of this quasi - stationary distribution .    in this paper ,",
    "we have been primarily concerned with the mathematical formulation of the theory and beginning a program of systematic investigation of the model .",
    "we believe that we have laid the foundations for this study with the analysis we have presented , but clearly there is much left to do . in order to make connection with observational data we will need to consider more realistic social networks through which linguistic innovations may be propagated ",
    "i.e . , non - trivial @xmath14 , as in fig .  1",
    ". bearing in mind the proposed importance of social forces that described in sec .",
    "[ framework ] , it will also be necessary to include of speakers or groups of speakers which may have more influence on language change than others  i.e . , non - trivial @xmath32",
    ". many of these cases will only be amenable to analysis through computer simulations , but it should be possible to obtain some analytical results with , for example , a simplified network structure .",
    "however , it is clear that even without any further developments , some of our results can be generalized .",
    "for instance , by proceeding as in sec .",
    "[ ss_moments ] , we can find that for general @xmath14 and @xmath106 , @xmath267 and therefore that the rate of change of @xmath268 is given by @xmath269 therefore @xmath270 is conserved not only when @xmath67 is constant , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ ss_moments ] , but also when @xmath106 is symmetric .",
    "in fact , the result can be further generalized .",
    "if we define the net `` rate of flow '' by @xmath271 then eq .",
    "( [ gen_2 ] ) may be written as @xmath272 so as long as @xmath273 for all @xmath4 , which may be thought of as a kind of detailed balance condition , then the overall mean is conserved .",
    "now if the mean is conserved , then the probability of a particular variant become fixed is simply its initial value .",
    "therefore no matter what the network or social structure , if @xmath274 for all @xmath4 , then this structure will have no effect on the probability of fixation .",
    "it is clear , however , that in general the further development of the model will necessitate the choice of a particular network and social structure . as an example of this",
    "we have recently begun to analyze the model in the context of the formation of the new zealand english dialect , for which a reasonable amount of data is available @xcite . in particular",
    "these give some information about the frequencies with which different linguistic variables were used by the first generations of native new zealand english speakers and their ultimate fate in the formation of today s conventional dialect .",
    "predictions from our model relating to extinction probabilities and timescales will play an important part in better understanding this data .",
