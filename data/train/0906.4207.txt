    "real systems are in general inhomogeneous due to the presence of impurities , line defects , boundaries , aperiodicity or disorder .",
    "such inhomogeneties may have a strong influence on the critical properties in the vicinity of a second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "depending on the relevance of the perturbation introduced by the inhomogeneity , the universality class governing the critical behaviour may change ; in some cases , the critical singularities may even be suppressed .",
    "besides this , the presence of spatially varying external fields ( magnetic , gravitational or thermal ) also influences the critical properties of a system .",
    "the effect of gravity on phase coexistence was studied in @xcite .",
    "phase separation induced by a thermal gradient was considered in @xcite .",
    "the application of a gradient perturbation was used as a tool for high - precision estimates of percolation threshold and exponents in @xcite .    in general the effect of a spatially varying field on a critical system",
    "is to smooth out the critical singularities .",
    "the reason for this is that the perturbation generated by the inhomogeneous field leads to a departure from the critical point which introduces a finite length scale in the problem @xcite",
    ". one may think about the usual finite - size scaling theory as a particular example where the spatially varying field is a confining potential of a box - like type @xcite .    for a field generating a power - law deviation from the critical point ,",
    "@xmath0 , the typical length scale introduced around the critical locus , @xmath1 , is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the correlation exponent . far away from this critical region , for @xmath4 ,",
    "the correlation length is small compared to the scale of the spatial change and the local properties at @xmath5 are determined by the corresponding homogeneous system with a constant deviation to the critical point given by the value @xmath6 .",
    "based on these observations , a scaling theory for the density profiles in the presence of gradient - field inhomogeneities was developed in @xcite .",
    "the validity of the scaling theory was checked at the mean - field level within ginsburg - landau theory and by comparing its predictions to the exact solution of an ising quantum chain in a linearly varying transverse field .",
    "the same scaling predictions were tested for the ising quantum chain with a linear - to - flat profile of the transverse field @xcite , for a spin-1 ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate in a space - varying magnetic field @xcite and for a classical ising lattice gas confined in a two - dimensional harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy for ising and xx quantum chains with linearly varying fields or couplings was studied in @xcite .",
    "quite recently the trap - size scaling was examined for the xy and bose - hubbard quantum chains @xcite .",
    "one may mention a formal analogy noticed in @xcite between the spatial inhomogeneous case discussed here and the quench dynamics situation where a system is driven through a critical point at finite rate . during the quench ,",
    "far away from the critical point , the system is able to adjust its state adiabatically as far as its relaxation time is much shorter than the typical time associated with the quench . on approaching the critical point , due to the critical slowing down , the typical quench time becomes much shorter than the system relaxation time and the evolution switch approximately to an impulse regime .",
    "close to the critical point , the typical time scale during which the state is frozen ( impulse evolution ) is given by equating the system relaxation time ( inverse of the first gap for a closed quantum system ) to the typical quench time scale . in the quantum case",
    "this leads to the self consistent equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the deviation to the critical point at time @xmath9 , @xmath5 the dynamical exponent and @xmath3 the correlation length exponent . for a power law deviation @xmath10",
    "one obtains @xmath11 in complete analogy with the spatial case . drawing on this analogy",
    ", we see that to the adiabatic evolution regime corresponds a `` super - static '' regime where , locally , the physical properties are determined solely invoking a local equilibrium hypothesis . on the contrary , on approaching ( either in time or in space ) the critical locus , the local equilibrium hypothesis ( time- or space - like ) breaks down due to the divergence of the typical time ( relaxation ) or space scale ( correlation length ) .",
    "all these studies were made in reference to the bulk critical behaviour , i.e. , when the locus of the critical field value is deep into the bulk of the system .",
    "however , if one shifts the critical locus toward a free surface , when close enough to it , the scaling behaviour of local quantities should depend on the surface critical properties . in the present work we consider such a situation for a semi - infinite system with an ordinary surface transition .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we present the scaling arguments for a semi - infinite system with a power - law deviation from the critical point when the critical locus is at the surface .",
    "the third section is devoted to the semi - infinite ising chain in a linearly or quadratically varying transverse field . in the linear case",
    "we solve analytically the problem while in the quadratic case the results are obtained through an exact numerical diagonalization . in both cases",
    "our findings are in perfect agreement with the scaling predictions .",
    "finally we summarize our results and indicate some possible developments in the last section .",
    "in the next sections we study either linear ( gradient ) perturbations , for which exact results can be obtained , or quadratic ones . thus here we shall examine the scaling behaviour for an arbitrary power law variation of the couplings .",
    "the system is semi - infinite , occupies the half - space @xmath12 with free boundary conditions at @xmath1 .",
