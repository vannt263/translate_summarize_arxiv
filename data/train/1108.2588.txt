    "robustness is a key feature in the analysis of complex systems , especially for complex biological systems .",
    "many organisms have strong adaptability to environmental changes or failures in some of their components , and can live even if some of their genes are mutated . in particular , it is known that cancer cells are very robust @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the origin of robustness of living cells has become an important research topic .",
    "in particular , extensive studies have focused on the analysis of structural robustness of metabolic networks .",
    "structural robustness refers to the tolerance of the system s behavior to changes in the structure of networks , and most existing studies focus on changes caused by knockout of gene(s ) or enzyme(s ) .",
    "one of the reasons why extensive studies have been done on structural robustness of metabolic networks is that rather accurate data of metabolic networks are available via such databases as the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) @xcite and the encyclopedia of _ escherichia coli _ k-12 genes and metabolism ( ecocyc ) @xcite , and kinetic parameters , which are not necessarily available , are not required .    in order to analyze the structural robustness of metabolic networks , the _ flux balance analysis _ ( fba ) methods have been widely used . in many of these approaches ,",
    "_ elementary flux modes _ ( efms ) play a key role , where an efm is a minimal set of reactions that can operate at steady state @xcite . based on fba and/or efm ,",
    "several studies have focused on finding a minimum reaction cut @xcite , that is , a minimum set of reaction ( or enzyme ) removals which prevent the production of a specified set of compounds .",
    "other fba - based measures of robustness have also been proposed .",
    "behre et al .",
    "proposed a measure based on the number of remaining efms after knockout versus the number of efms in the unperturbed situation @xcite .",
    "deutscher et al . proposed another measure using the shaply value from game theory @xcite .",
    "other approaches have been proposed based on boolean models of metabolic networks in which reactions and compounds are modeled as and and or nodes , respectively .",
    "handorf et al .",
    "analyzed robustness of metabolic networks by introducing the concept of _ scope _ @xcite .",
    "li et al . , sridhar et al . , and tamura et al .",
    "developed integer programming - based methods for finding a minimum reaction cut in boolean models of metabolic networks @xcite .",
    "smart et al . defined the _ topological flux balance _ ( tfb ) criterion based on a boolean model of metabolic networks and analyzed the _ damage _ ( number of reactions ) caused by knockout of a single reaction under tfb @xcite .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "defined and analyzed the _ impact degree _ , which is the number of reactions inactivated by knockout of a specific reaction @xcite . although there are some differences in the treatment of reversible reactions , the damage and the impact degree are very similar concepts .",
    "cong et al .",
    "extended the impact degree for knockout of multiple reactions @xcite .    in this paper , we study the distribution of the impact degree caused by random knockout of a single reaction using the theory of branching process @xcite . in order to analyze earthquakes , saichev et al .",
    "proposed a branching process with power - law distributions of offspring @xmath0 : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some constant , and approximately derived the distribution of the total number of offsprings @xcite .",
    "we regard propagation of the impact of knockout of a reaction as a branching process , and apply their method to estimate the impact degree distribution , where the impact degree in our problem corresponds to the total number of offsprings in the branching process . in order to apply this method",
    ", we develop a simple method for estimating the offspring distribution in a metabolic network .",
    "although smart et al .",
    "have already applied percolation theory and branching process to analysis of the size distribution of rigid clusters , defined as clusters of contagion nodes that do not contain any branched metabolite nodes ( see fig .",
    "3a in @xcite ) , they did not explicitly estimate the damage distribution ( i.e. , the impact degree distribution ) .",
    "we finally show an estimation method for the damage distributions .",
    "the proposed method is applied to analysis of metabolic networks of four species : _ escherichia coli _ , _ bacillus subtilis _ , _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ and _ homo sapiens_. the results show good agreement of impact degree distributions between empirical results and theoretical estimates .",
    "jiang et al . proposed the _ impact degree _ as a measure of the importance of each reaction in a metabolic network @xcite .",
    "the impact degree is defined as the number of inactivated reactions caused by knockout of a single reaction .",
    "however , they did not consider the effect of cycles in metabolic networks . since cycles play an important role in metabolic networks , cong et al .",
    "extended the impact degree so that the effect of cycles is taken into account @xcite by using a concept of the maximal valid assignment @xcite . here , we briefly review the definition of this extended impact degree @xcite .    as in other works , we regard each metabolic network as a bipartite directed graph .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be a set of _ compound nodes _ and a set of _ reaction nodes _ respectively , where @xmath5 .",
    "metabolic network _ is defined as a directed graph @xmath6 in which either @xmath7 or @xmath8 holds for each edge @xmath9 . means logical and of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ]",
    "each reaction and compound takes one of two states : 0 or 1 , where 0 and 1 correspond to inactive and active reactions ( compounds ) , respectively .",
    "reverse reactions are treated as two irreversible reactions .    in order to define the impact degree of a reaction",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "suppose that reaction @xmath12 is knocked out .",
    "then , we start with the global state where all compounds are active ( i.e. , @xmath13 for all @xmath14 ) and all reactions but @xmath12 are active ( i.e. , @xmath15 for all @xmath16 and @xmath17 )",
    ". then , we alternatively update the states of reactions and compounds by the following rules .    1 .   for each reaction , there are three different compounds : consumed compounds ( i.e. , substrates ) , produced compounds ( i.e. , products ) , and directly unrelated compounds .",
    "a reaction is inactivated if any of its consumed or produced compound is inactivated .",
    "3 .   for each compound",
    ", there are three different reactions : consuming reactions , producing reactions , and directly unrelated reaction .",
    "a compound is inactivated if all its consuming reactions or all its producing reactions are inactivated .",
    "since no activation is possible in this process , the procedure converges to a stable state in a finite number of iterations .",
    "the impact degree of reaction @xmath12 is defined as the number of inactivated reactions in the stable state .",
    "this procedure simultaneously gives the definition of the impact degree and an algorithm to compute it .",
    "let us illustrate the above process with the metabolic network shown in fig .",
    "[ exnet ] .",
    "suppose that reaction @xmath18 is knocked out .",
    "then , the states of nodes change as shown in table  [ exknock1 ] .",
    "since four reactions ( including @xmath18 ) are inactivated in the stable state , the resulting impact degree is four .",
    "next , suppose that reaction @xmath19 is knocked out . in this case , the states of nodes change as shown in table  [ exknock2 ] and the resulting impact degree is two .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath20 is not inactivated because @xmath18 is still active in this case .",

    "we proposed a model to estimate the impact degree distributions in metabolic networks , using a branching process approximation , and demonstrated its validity on real data .",
    "the power - law model could more accurately estimate the impact degree distributions in real metabolic networks than the poisson model because the number of offsprings for each reaction node is assumed to follow the power - law distribution .",
    "especially , the power - law model showed the significant agreements between the predicted distribution and the observed distribution although the case of _ h. sapiens _ represented the small @xmath21-value for the ks test ( i.e. , the low probability that the distribution is similar between models and observed data ) .",
    "however , there is no great difference of the prediction accuracy for estimating the impact degree distributions between the power - law model and the poisson model ; thus , the poisson model may be useful for a rough estimate of the impact degree distributions .",
    "intrinsically , the distribution of the total number of offsprings [ i.e. , @xmath22 is not significantly different between the power - law model and the poisson model in the case of smaller @xmath23 . as a simple example",
    ", we here consider the case of @xmath24 ( i.e. , the critical case ) . in this case , the impact degree distributions @xmath25 of the power - law model and the poisson model correspond to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "especially , @xmath25 of the power - law model is the power - law distribution with the exponent ranging between @xmath28 and @xmath29 because of @xmath30 ; thus it is not critically different from @xmath31 of the possion model for smaller @xmath23 .",
    "since the impact degrees of real metabolic networks ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) were relatively small ( @xmath32 ) , there might be no great difference of the prediction accuracy between these models .",
    "the similarity of predicted distributions of the total number of offsprings between the poisson model and the power - law model is also explained using the otter s theorem [ theorem 13.1 in @xcite ] .",
    "this theorem indicates that the distribution @xmath25 of the total number of offsprings has the universal property of a power - law tail with the exponent @xmath33 as @xmath34 under mild conditions on offspring distributions , and it implies that the types of offspring distributions hardly influence the distribution of the total number of offsprings ( i.e. , impact degree distributions ) .",
    "note the otter s theorem does not contradict with the analytical distribution @xmath25 of the power - law model because this theorem is not directly applicable to the power - law model due to the different assumptions in the derivation of @xmath25 between the power - law model and the otter s theorem .",
    "the prediction performance is influenced by the assumption of offspring distributions and the fidelity of branching processes .",
    "to purely evaluate the validity of branching process approximation , the empirical model is useful because of no assumption of offspring distributions .",
    "it is expected that the empirical model show the best prediction accuracy because of using empirical offspring distributions . in the case of bacteria ( i.e. , _",
    "e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ ) , this expectation is true , suggesting that the branching process approximation is useful for estimating the impact degree distributions . in the case of eukaryotes ( i.e. , _ s. cerevisiae _ and _ h. sapiens _ ) , on the other hand , we observed the unexpected results : the empirical model shows the relatively - low prediction accuracy . especially , the prediction accuracy of the empirical model is lowest in the case of _ h. sapiens _",
    "( human ) .",
    "this result implies limitations to the estimation of impact degree distributions based on the branching process approximation in the case of metabolic networks of eukaryotes ( i.e. , higher organisms ) .",
    "a limitation of the branching process approximation is that we need to assume tree structures of networks ( i.e. , no cycles ) .",
    "the presence of cycles may lead to an overestimation of the number of offsprings @xmath35 for each reaction , because some offsprings of a progenitor ( reaction node ) may have already been inactivated due to cycle structures .",
    "from this reason , the models may overestimate the impact degree distributions . on the other hand , however , some reactions with more than one incoming edge may be inactivated in the presence of cycles , if all their parents are inactivated through different paths . in this case , the number of offsprings is underestimated .",
    "the estimation of the number of offsprings depends on the relative importance of these two effects , and it may be not simple .",
    "the difficulty in this estimation is also a limitation of the model .",
    "the branching process model needs to be improved by considering additional assumptions other than metabolic network structures in order to obtain better predictions .",
    "for example , the assumption of variable propagations in the branching process @xcite , in which the mean of offspring distributions differs at each propagation stage , may be useful because the degree of propagation may depend on metabolic dynamics such as gene expressions and metabolite concentrations . to apply this modified branching process model , time - series data on metabolic dynamics after gene disruptions , which are obtained by metabolomic analysis , are necessary for estimating the mean of offspring distribution at each propagation stage ( i.e. , time after gene disruptions ) .",
    "since such data are unavailable at present , however , it is difficult to apply this modified branching process model .",
    "similarly , other biologically - suitable assumptions are hardly determined because of few observed data on metabolic dynamics .",
    "although there are above constraints on observed data on metabolic dynamics , we believe that the consideration of the additional information improves the prediction of impact degree distributions . in the future , the improvement of the prediction of the impact degree distributions using the branching process approximation may be possible with available data on metabolic dynamics .",
    "the branching process approximation is useful for estimating the impact degree distributions in metabolic networks although it has the above limitations ; thus , it may be a powerful tool for evaluating a robustness of biological systems .",
