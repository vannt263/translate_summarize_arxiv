    "phases play an extraordinary role in quantum theory . on one hand",
    ", they represent the central ingredient of wave mechanics @xmath6 la schrdinger , and on the other , they build a bridge to classical mechanics @xmath6 la hamilton - jacobi @xcite . for these reasons",
    "they constitute a crucial ingredient of matter wave interferometers @xcite which nowadays represent standard tools for precision measurements . in this article",
    "we consider a new type of atom interferometer whose phase scales with the cube of the time @xmath0 the atom spends in the interferometer .      during an impromptu seminar at the nato advanced summer institute at bad windsheim in 1981",
    "eugene paul wigner expressed his discomfort with general relativity @xcite in view of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "he emphasized that the notion of a space - time trajectory which is a crucial element of gravity is incompatible with the uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics .",
    "guided by the work of niels bohr and leon rosenfeld on the limitations of the electromagnetic field @xcite due to quantum fluctuations he argued that quantum theory puts severe restrictions on the measurement of the metric tensor representing the gravitational field .",
    "wigner s thoughts expressed in this seminar were a consequence of his work several decades earlier .",
    "indeed , already in 1958 together with helmut salecker he had constructed a clock @xcite based on the reflection of light signals from two mirrors and had analyzed the restrictions of the uncertainty relation on the weight of the mirrors .    in this context",
    "it is also worth mentioning that h. salecker at the _ conference on the role of gravitation in physics _ in chapel hill in 1957 triggered @xcite a discussion on the equivalence principle by a gedanken experiment involving a stream of particles being scattered off a diffraction grating .",
    "daniel m. greenberger @xcite a decade later considered a similar arrangement and even argued that mass in quantum mechanics should be an operator .",
    "the celebrated colella - overhauser - werner ( cow ) experiment @xcite performed in 1975 propelled these and many other thoughts about the interference of quantum and gravity to the real world .",
    "indeed , based on the de broglie wave nature of neutrons @xcite the cow experiment could measure for the first time the phase shift between two arms of a neutron interferometer induced by the gravitational potential of the earth @xcite .",
    "the development of new sources of cold atoms @xcite as well as molecules @xcite and , in particular , the realization of bose - einstein condensates @xcite has ushered in a new era of experiments at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity .",
    "now , novel tests of the equivalence principle based on matter wave interferometry of different isotopes of the same atom @xcite such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 or even different species @xcite such as @xmath9 and @xmath8 could be performed .",
    "even the detection of gravitational waves based on atom interferometry is pursued today @xcite .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that gravitational decoherence gives rise to a universal decoherence .",
    "moreover , the atom laser @xcite utilizes gravity to form an airy mode .",
    "furthermore , it is mind - boggling that nowadays measurements of atomic transitions @xcite are sensitive to the redshift of the gravitational field .    an extremely interesting development in this realm is again taking place in the field of neutron optics due to the experimental realization of the quantum bouncer @xcite . here",
    "neutrons exposed to the gravitational field of the earth are reflected from a surface and oscillate up and down .",
    "in particular , they experience a potential consisting of the linear ramp and an infinitely steep wall .",
    "it is amazing that a measurement of the transitions between the resulting discrete energy levels can put upper bounds @xcite on dark energy and dark matter scenarios .",
    "hopefully these few examples convey the excitement in this field of quantum optics and gravity . notwithstanding",
    "the fact that we still do not have a complete understanding of quantum gravity @xcite we have come a long way since the early salecker - wigner discussions but many questions remain .",
    "indeed , goals such as gravitational wave detection or a compact gravimeter @xcite based on atom optics drive the strive for higher sensitivity of these devices .",
    "the kasevich - chu atom interferometer @xcite which is the work horse of atom optics is analogous to the neutron interferometer employed by the cow experiment .",
    "the bragg diffraction of the neutron from three crystal planes of a silicon slab are replaced by raman diffraction of the atom from three standing light crystals . as a result ,",
    "the phase shift introduced by the gravitational potential is _ quadratic _ in the time @xmath10 the particle spends in the interferometer .",
    "needless to say a different scaling of the phase shift , for example with @xmath2 , could lead to an enhanced sensitivity of the interferometer . in the present article",
    "we propose such an interferometer and describe our progress towards realizing it .",
    "our device rests on three principles : ( i ) we take advantage of the cubic dependence of the phase in the propagator in a linear potential .",
    "( ii ) we employ two different internal states of the atom which experience different accelerations .",
    "( iii ) we close the interferometer in position _ and _ velocity by a sequence of four laser pulses .",
    "our article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] serves as a motivation . here",
    "we recall that the propagator of a particle in a linear potential displays a phase which is cubic in time .",
    "we show that this global phase depends on the initial wave function and outline an interferometric measurement scheme . in this arrangement",
    "the resulting interferometer phase which is cubic in time is independent of the initial state of the center - of - mass motion .    in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we introduce our interferometer capable of measuring the cubic phase accumulated by a particle during its motion in a linear potential provided by a constant gravitational field and magnetic field gradient .",
    "the three - level atom probing these fields has two ground states corresponding to two different magnetic quantum numbers and experiences a sequence of four raman pulses . in order to close the interferometer in position",
    "_ and _ velocity , we choose the separation of @xmath11 between the pulses .",
    "the resulting probability for the atom to exit the interferometer in one of the two ground states is the familiar oscillatory function , which is then independent of the initial wave function .",
    "however , in contrast to standard interferometers the argument now depends on the phase cubic in @xmath0 and the discrete third derivative of the laser phase .",
    "we dedicate section [ sec:4 ] to a comparison of the present scheme to the kasevich - chu interferometer @xcite and distinguish the cubic phase shift from the ones caused by a gravity gradient or the continuous - acceleration bloch ( cab ) technique @xcite . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we discuss a possible experimental implementation of our proposal .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:6 ] by briefly summarizing our results and providing an outlook .    in order to keep our",
    "article self - contained but focused on the central ideas , we include lengthy calculations in five appendices . in appendix",
    "[ sec : a ] we recall the technique of creating coherent superpositions of the two ground states and interchanging their populations using raman pulses .",
    "we then turn in appendix [ sec : b ] to a description of our interferometer as a sequence of unitary operators . in appendix",
    "[ sec : c ] we derive the conditions to close our interferometer and obtain in appendix [ sec : d ] an explicit expression for the interferometer phase induced by a linear potential .",
    "finally in appendix [ sec : e ] we make contact with the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite developed for a rather general form of interferometer and rederive the phase of our @xmath2-interferometer .",
    "this approach brings out again that in contrast to the corresponding global phase this phase is independent of the initial state of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "the propagator of a quantum particle experiencing a linear potential is determined by a phase factor governed by the corresponding classical action .",
    "since the relevant classical motion involves time in the coordinate and velocity in a quadratic and a linear way , both the kinetic as well as potential energies bring in time quadratically . as a result",
    ", the action being the integral over time must contain a term proportional to the cube of time .",
    "this cubic phase which is independent of the coordinate is at the center of our interest in the present section .",
    "we first recall the essential features of the propagator for the wave function in a linear potential . here",
    "we focus especially on this cubic phase .",
    "moreover , we note that due to the huygens principle for matter waves the integration over the initial coordinate leads to a dependence of this phase on the initial wave function .",
    "although we find this property interesting we emphasize that it is of no importance for the present discussion . indeed , due to the born rule we can not measure the global phase factor of a _ single _ quantum system .",
    "however , an interferometric measurement of the difference of two different global phase factors of _ two _ systems is possible . in such an interferometer",
    "the cubic phase is independent @xcite of the initial wave function .",
    "we start our analysis by discussing the propagator of a particle in a linear potential . here",
    "we emphasize especially the emergence of the phase factor cubic in time .",

    "the cubic phase @xmath41 in the propagator of a quantum particle moving in a linear potential manifests itself in every wave function exposed to this situation .",

    "( [ wave - function ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the integration of the remaining parts of the propagator in combination with the initial wave function can change the numerical factor in the cubic phase . in order to address this feature in more detail",

    "do we find a pure cubic phase dependence on @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , between the extremes the time dependence is more complicated as expressed in fig .",
    "2 .      the propagator @xmath31 defined in eq .",
    "( [ propagator - cl ] ) contains a global phase which is cubic in time .",
    "due to the integration over the initial position in the huygens integral , eq .",
    "( [ wave - function ] ) , this phase depends on the initial wave function .",
    "these two sentences summarize in a pregnant way our results of the preceding section .",
    "we now briefly outline our interferometric measurement strategy for this phase . in the course of our analysis we shall find that the phase in this interferometer is independent of the initial state .",
    "obviously a setup providing us only with the probability density @xmath61 is insensitive to any global phase like the @xmath2-phase .",
    "therefore , we need to involve an interferometric measurement either with a path - dependent mass of the particle , or a path - dependent strength of the constant force .    throughout this article",
    "we focus on the second alternative although we can imagine possibilities to utilize the dependence of the mass on the internal state .",
    "key elements of our technique are : ( i ) an atom with both a magnetically sensitive and a magnetically insensitive internal states and ( ii ) an external time - independent magnetic field with a constant gradient along one direction . due to the zeeman effect ,",
    "such an atom experiences a constant force determined by its internal state .",
    "it is the same force that acts on a classical magnetic dipole in a non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "in this section we introduce the two crucial elements of our @xmath2-interferometer : ( i ) the zeeman shift of the atomic levels induced by the external time - independent magnetic field with a constant gradient along one direction , and ( ii ) the population dynamics of the two resonant states of the atom driven by the raman laser pulses .",

    "we have considered an atom with a magnetic sensitive , and an insensitive internal state being exposed to a constant gravitational field and a magnetic field of constant gradient . by applying a sequence of four co - propagating raman pulses , the atom interferometer can be closed in position _ and _ velocity .",

    "this term emerges from the eigenvalue equation in momentum space due to the integration of the kinetic energy which is quadratic in momentum .    when we suddenly turn - off the potential the so - created airy wave packet accelerates and its probability density keeps its shape @xcite during the free propagation .",
    "deeper insight @xcite into this surprising phenomenon springs from wigner phase space @xcite and the fact that the wigner function of the airy wave packet is again an airy function .",
    "closely related to the cubic phase in the airy integral and the dispersionless free propagation of an airy wave packet is the oscillatory probability density created by a point source @xcite located in a linear potential and continuously emitting particles into all three space directions with an identical speed .",
    "these oscillations appearing in the plane orthogonal to the gravitational force are a consequence of the interference between two classical trajectories of different inclinations .",
    "the knowledge of the two distinct paths encoded in the different arrival times is erased by the continuous stream of particles .",
    "again the origin of this particular interference pattern can be traced back to the cubic phase in the green s function .",
    "due to the analogy between the constant gravitational field and the constant electric field between two plates of a capacitor discussed in the beginning of this article one might wonder if it is possible to construct a similar charged particle fountain .",
    "indeed , in the case of electrons in a uniform electric field such type of fountain has already been realized in photoionization and photodetachment microscopes @xcite .",
    "it would be fascinating to illuminate the similarities and differences between these three examples of cubic phases and our @xmath2-interferometer .",
    "unfortunately this task goes beyond the scope of the present article and has to be postponed to future publications .",

    "<S> the quantum mechanical propagator of a massive particle in a linear gravitational potential derived already in 1927 by earle h. kennard @xcite contains a phase that scales with the third power of the time @xmath0 during which the particle experiences the corresponding force . since in conventional atom interferometers </S>",
    "<S> the internal atomic states are all exposed to the same acceleration @xmath1 , this @xmath2-phase cancels out and the interferometer phase scales as @xmath3 . in contrast , by applying an external magnetic field we prepare two different accelerations @xmath4 and @xmath5 for two internal states of the atom , which translate themselves into two different cubic phases and the resulting interferometer phase scales as @xmath2 . </S>",
