    "hexint    discrete breathers are time - periodic and spatially localised exact solutions of translationally invariant nonlinear lattices . for a brief review of some general properties of breathers in higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "see our earlier work @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that while some fundamental properties such as the existence of breathers are not affected by lattice dimension ( see flach @xcite and mackay and aubry @xcite ) , other properties are affected profoundly , for instance , the energy properties of breathers ( see flach @xcite , kastner @xcite and weinstein @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate how the symmetry of the lattice influences the properties of discrete breathers found therein .    in hamiltonian systems ,",
    "stationary breathers occur in one - parameter families . for a certain class of hamiltonian systems , a critical spatial dimension @xmath0 exists such that for systems with @xmath1 , there exists a positive lower bound on the energy of a breather family , and the breather energies do _ not _ approach zero even as the amplitude tends to zero . for lattices with dimension @xmath2 ,",
    "there is no positive lower bound on the energy of breathers . in other words , the energy of a family of breathers goes to zero with amplitude , and breathers of arbitrarily small energy can be found .",
    "the critical dimension @xmath0 is typically two . a small amplitude expansion yields the nls reduction to @xmath3 which has a critical dimension of @xmath4 , with blow - up in nls occurring when @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for typical lattice potentials , @xmath7 again confirming the critical dimension of @xmath8 .",
    "marin , eilbeck and russell have performed extensive numerical investigations of breather dynamics in two - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that moving breather modes exist ( or are at least extremely long - lived ) , and that the lattice exhibits a strong directional preference whereby breathers can only move along symmetries of the lattice , and in no other direction .",
    "such quasi - one - dimensional behaviour is also observed in higher - dimensional lattices .",
    "the work in this paper follows on from our earlier study @xcite of breathers in a two - dimensional lattice with square rotational symmetry ; hereupon referred to as the `` square '' lattice .",
    "this lattice has @xmath9 symmetry , by which we mean that a rotation through any multiple of @xmath10 about an axis perpendicular to the lattice plane through a lattice site maps the lattice onto itself . in @xcite , using the semi - discrete multiple - scale method ( see remoissenet @xcite ) , we determined an approximate form for ( as well as the properties of ) small amplitude breathers in a two - dimensional square fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattice @xcite .",
    "we found a third - order analysis to be inadequate , since the partial differential equation obtained at this order describing the breather envelope exhibits blow - up . to overcome this , we incorporated higher - order effects in the model , thereby obtaining a modified partial differential equation which includes known stabilising terms . from this , we determined regions of parameter space where breather solutions are expected .",
    "numerical simulations supported the results of our analysis , and suggested that , in contrast to the two - component lattices studied by marin  @xcite ( that is , with two degrees of freedom at each lattice site ) , there is no restriction upon the permitted directions of travel within the one - component square fpu lattice .",
    "we also found asymptotic estimates for the breather energy which confirmed the existence of a minimum threshold energy , in agreement with the work of flach  @xcite .",
    "hexetl    in this paper , we consider a hexagonal electrical transmission lattice ( hetl ) .",
    "this two - dimensional network possesses @xmath11 ( or hexagonal ) rotational symmetry .",
    "that is , rotation through any multiple of the angle @xmath12 about a lattice site maps the lattice onto itself .",
    "the hetl is shown in , pictured from a point vertically above the plane of the lattice .",
    "we note from that geometrically , the hetl is an arrangement of tessellating triangles ( not hexagons ) .",
    "nevertheless , the arrangement in is referred to as `` hexagonal '' rather than `` triangular '' since these descriptions refer to its symmetry properties and not to the geometrical shapes which comprise the array ( not all authors follow this convention ) .",
    "one might expect the analysis for the hexagonal lattice to be more involved , since it is geometrically more complicated in having more links emanating from each node .",
    "however , the hexagonal symmetry results in greater isotropy and hence simpler equations than those obtained for the square lattice .",
    "we derive the equations of motion and demonstrate a hamiltonian formalism in . in sections [ hexsym ] and [ hexasymm ] , we present two cases for which the hexagonal fpu lattice equations can be reduced to a two - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with cubic nonlinearity .",
    "we consider lattices with a symmetric interaction potential , in which case reduction to a cubic nls equation can be performed for moving breathers .",
    "we find an ellipticity criterion for the wavenumbers of the carrier wave in .",
    "a reduction to the cubic nls equation can also be carried out for lattices with an asymmetric potential , provided we consider only stationary breathers .",
    "as expected we find a minimum energy below which breathers can not exist in the hexagonal fpu lattice .",
    "we find that the energy threshold is dependent upon the wavevector of the carrier wave .",
    "it is maximised for stationary breathers , and becomes arbitrarily small near the boundary of the elliptic domain .",
    "the cubic nls equation admits only unstable townes solitons .",
    "hence , in , we extend our asymptotic analysis to higher order and find an isotropic generalised nls equation which incorporates known stabilising terms .",
    "our analytic work is supplemented by numerical simulations presented in , which suggest that long - lived stationary and moving breather modes are supported by the system . in",
    ", we discuss the results obtained in this paper .",
    "hexfpulat      hexpre    before we derive the equations governing the hetl , we describe our scheme for indexing the lattice nodes and our choice of basis vectors .",

    "this equation is slightly simpler than the corresponding equation obtained for the square lattice , namely ( 3.11 ) of @xcite . in particular , the higher - order dispersive terms in are isotropic , reflecting the hexagonal rotational symmetry of the lattice . for stationary breathers in the case of a symmetric potential",
    "we find that the cubic nonlinearity does not give rise to third harmonics , that is , @xmath237 in the hexagonal lattice , in contrast to @xmath342 in the square lattice .    in",
    ", we illustrated these breather modes , showing that both stationary and moving breathers are long - lived .",
    "the breather profiles change little over time , a small amount of energy is shed due to the initial conditions being only approximate .",
    "we have successfully propagated long - lived breathers moving in directions which are not axes of symmetry of the lattice ( for instance , @xmath343 ) , suggesting that there is no absolute restriction upon the direction of travel ; this is in contrast to the observations reported by marin @xcite for mechanical ( two - component ) two - dimensional lattices , who could only find breathers which travelled along axes of symmetry of the lattice .",

    "equation ( [ nlsrl ] ) arises from a variational derivative of @xmath350 using a trial solution of the form @xmath351 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are undetermined parameters , we find @xmath352 @xmath141 and @xmath142 are determined by seeking stationary points of the action @xmath353 , namely @xmath354 .",
