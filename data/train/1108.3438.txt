    "the map @xmath335 is univalent in @xmath32 for any admissible @xmath176 and @xmath177 , so that we only have to prove the inverse @xmath336 is univalent in @xmath32 .",

    "the explicit formula for @xmath338 is @xmath339 let us define @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "first we consider @xmath283 .",
    "since the image of the function @xmath342 for @xmath101 is contained in the sector @xmath343 , one can easily see that @xmath344 contains a half line starting from @xmath191 .",

    "then @xmath285 is @xmath42-infinitely divisible if and only if @xmath286 . the lvy measure @xmath387 for @xmath388 can be calculated as @xmath389    because of remark [ rem2](iv ) , let us consider @xmath390 for simplicity .",
