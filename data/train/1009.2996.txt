    "originally predicted by schrdinger in the study of the dirac equation @xcite , zitterbewegung ( zb ) refers to the trembling motion of a freely - moving relativistic quantum particle that arises from the interference between the positive- and negative - energy parts of the spinor wave function @xcite . for a free electron ,",
    "the dirac equation predicts the zb to have an extremely small amplitude ( of the order of the compton wavelength @xmath1 ) and an extremely high frequency ( @xmath2 ) , making such an effect experimentally inaccessible .",
    "in addition , the physical relevance of zb in relativistic quantum mechanics is a controversial issue because such an effect arises in the framework of the single - particle picture of the dirac equation , but not in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the notion of zb and resulting formalism , however , are not peculiar to relativistic quantum dynamics , and phenomena analogous to zb , which underly the same mathematical model of the dirac equation , have so far predicted in a wide variety of quantum and even classical physical systems , including among others semiconductors and quantum wells @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , graphene @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , acoustic @xcite and photonic @xcite systems . simulations of relativistic quantum effects using experimentally - accessible physical set - ups , in which parameter tunability allows access to different physical regimes , have seen in recent years an increasing interest , culminating to the very recent first experimental observation of a quantum analogue of zb using a single trapped ion set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle @xcite . in the optical context , the use of photonic systems to mimic quantum phenomena in the lab has seen a continuous and increasing interest ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) ; in particular , optical analogues of the relativistic zb have been recently proposed to occur in photonic crystals @xcite , metamaterial slabs @xcite , and binary waveguide arrays @xcite . in this work",
    "it is shown theoretically that a classical analogue of zb can be observed in a much simpler and well - known set - up of nonlinear optics , namely in the process of sum frequency generation of light waves in a nonlinear @xmath0 medium @xcite in presence of pulse ( or spatial ) walk off . in the nonlinear optics context ,",
    "optical three - wave interaction ( twi ) in nonlinear @xmath0 media in presence of temporal ( or spatial ) walk - off is a well - known process , which has been widely investigated especially in connection to pulse compression of ultrashort pulses and to twi soliton theory ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "notably , the nonlinear twi equations are solvable by inverse scattering methods @xcite .",
    "however , the zb phenomenon discussed in this work and the idea of exploiting nonlinear optics to mimic the dirac equation have not been addressed in such previous studies .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is provided by a standard model of twi in a nonlinear quadratic medium describing propagation of either optical pulses or optical beams at frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in presence of either group velocity mismatch or spatial walk - off . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we will consider here the case of optical pulse interaction in presence of temporal walk - off ( i.e. of group velocity mismatch ) , however the results hold also for spatial beam propagation in a quadratic medium with spatial walk - off provided that the temporal coordinate is replaced by a transverse spatial coordinate ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . assuming that group velocity dispersion is negligible , in the plane - wave approximation and assuming perfect phase matching , pulse propagation in the @xmath0 medium is described by the following set of nonlinear coupled equations @xcite :",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the amplitude of the electric field envelope at the carrier frequencies @xmath9 , normalized such that @xmath10 is the photon flux at frequency @xmath9 , @xmath11 is the group velocity in the medium at frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the strength of the nonlinear interaction , which reads explicitly @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the refractive index of the medium at frequency @xmath9 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath17 is the effective nonlinear coefficient . to achieve perfect phase matching , a quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) grating for the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 can be employed ; in this case one has ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the phase mismatch of the three waves and the overbar denotes a spatial average over a few modulation periods of the qpm grating .",
    "equations ( 1 - 3 ) admit of the following two invariants along the propagation distance @xmath20 @xmath21 which correspond to photon flux conservation ( manley - rowe invariants ) in the frequency conversion process .",
    "solitary waves of eqs.(1 - 3 ) in the fully nonlinear regime , including trapped bright - dark - bright solitary waves with locked velocity , have been investigated in refs.@xcite . to study the analogue of zb in the frequency conversion process",
    ", we assume here that at the input plane @xmath22 the nonlinear crystal is excited by a strong and nearly continuous - wave pump field at frequency @xmath3 , and by a weak and short signal pulse at frequency @xmath4 and temporal profile @xmath23 . under such assumptions , the invariance of @xmath24 implies that the pump wave remains nearly undepleted along the propagation distance , and eqs.(1 - 3 ) reduce to the following two linear coupled - field equations describing sum - frequency generation in the undepleted regime @xmath25 where we have set @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the intensity of the pump field . without loss of generality",
    ", @xmath28 can be assumed to be real - valued and positive .",
    "note that , in the absence of group velocity mismatch for the signal and second - harmonic waves at frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath29 , i.e. for @xmath30 , the solution to eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) is analogous to the one for stationary fields @xcite , which shows a well - known oscillatory power transfer , along the propagation distance @xmath20 , between the two fields with spatial period @xmath31 ; namely one has @xmath32 where @xmath33 . note that , in spite of the oscillatory power transfer in the frequency conversion process , the two pulses propagates with the common group velocity @xmath34 and do not show any trembling ( jitter ) motion",
    "if the group velocity mismatch is not negligible ( @xmath35 ) , the solution to eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) is more involved , and is given by eqs.(25 ) and ( 26 ) discussed in the next section .",
    "here we anticipate that , in this regime , the oscillatory power transfer between the two fields is generally accompanied by an oscillatory motion of the pulse center of mass , which is reminiscent of zb for the free relativistic dirac electron .",
    "to highlight such an analogy in a formal way , it is worth introducing the coordinates of a moving frame @xmath36 where the velocity @xmath34 is defined by the relation @xmath37 in the moving frame , eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) take the form @xmath38 where we have set @xmath39 equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are supplemented with the boundary conditions @xmath40 after introduction of the spinor wave field @xmath41 , eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) can be finally cast into the dirac form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the pauli matrices .",
    "note that , after the formal change @xmath45 eq.(17 ) corresponds to the one - dimensional dirac equation for a relativistic particle of mass @xmath46 in absence of external fields , moving alon the @xmath47 axis , written in the weyl representation @xcite",
    ". therefore , the _ temporal _ evolution of the spinor wave function @xmath48 for the dirac particle is mapped into the _ spatial _ evolution of the envelopes @xmath49 and @xmath50 for signal and sum - frequency pulses , respectively , whereas the spatial coordinate of the dirac particle is mapped into the retarded time @xmath51 of the optical pulses .",
    "for the dirac equation ( 17 ) , zb refers to the rapid oscillatory motion of the expectation value of the particle position @xmath52 around its mean trajectory , which arises whenever negative- and positive - energy eigenstates of the dirac equation are simultaneously excitated by the initial condition . note that , indicating by @xmath53 and @xmath54 the ( temporal ) center of mass of the signal and sum - frequency pulses at the crystal plane @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 one can write @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the photon fluences of the signal and sum - frequency pulses at the plane @xmath59 , respectively , and @xmath60 is the manley - rowe invariant . in particular ,",
    "if the initial pulse envelope @xmath23 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath61 , as it will be shown below one has @xmath62 , and thus according to eq.(21 ) the zb of the dirac particle for eq.(17 ) can be simply retrieved from the temporal jitter @xmath63 and fractional energy @xmath64 of the signal pulse .",
    "+ the solution to eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) with @xmath65 and with the boundary conditions ( 16 ) can be readily obtained in the spectral ( fourier ) domain .",
    "indicating by @xmath66 the spectra of the signal and sum - frequency fields at the propagation plane @xmath67 , one has @xmath68 \\\\ \\hat{a}_{3}(\\xi,\\omega ) & = & - \\frac{i \\kappa}{\\beta } \\hat{g}(\\omega ) \\sin ( \\beta \\xi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the spectrum of the signal pulse incident onto the crystal at @xmath70 , and @xmath71 in the temporal domain , the inverse fourier transform of eqs.(22 ) and ( 23 ) yields the following exact solution for the sum - frequency and signal pulses traveling along the crystal @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the zero - order bessel function of first kind . to calculate @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
    "let us assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the signal pulse envelope @xmath23 at the input crystal plane has a symmetric profile ( with e.g. a gaussian or a sech shape ) satisfying the condition @xmath78 . in this case , from eq.(25 )",
    "it follows that @xmath79 , and thus @xmath80 the explicit expression of @xmath53 , as obtained by substitution of eq.(26 ) into eq.(20 ) , turns out to be rather cumbersome and not of easy physical interpretation .",
    "however , for a signal spectrum @xmath81 narrow at around @xmath82 with a spectral width @xmath83 much smaller than @xmath84 , i.e. for a relatively long input pulse , simple approximate expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath85 can be obtained , which read explicitly @xmath86 where @xmath83 is the spectral width of the input signal pulse , defined by @xmath87 .",
    "the oscillatory motion of @xmath88 and @xmath76 along the propagation coordinate @xmath67 of the crystal basically follows the oscillatory - like of optical transfer between signal and sum - frequency pulses .",
    "note also that , according to eq.(28 ) and because of the assumption @xmath89 , the pulse center of mass @xmath90 takes large values at the propagation distances @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , ... where most of the signal field is converted into the sum - frequency field",
    ". + as an example , let us consider the process of sum frequency generation in a nonlinear periodically - poled lithium - niobate ( pplnb ) crystal ( see , for instance , @xcite ) assuming @xmath94 nm , @xmath95 nm , and @xmath96 nm for the wavelengths ( in vacuum ) of pump , signal and sum - frequency waves , respectively . from sellmeir equations @xcite , one can estimate at 25@xmath97c and for extraordinary waves @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and a qpm period of @xmath103 m , which is easily accessible with current poling technology . for first - order qpm with alternating sign",
    "of @xmath0 with period @xmath104 , the effective nonlinear coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the element of the nonlinear @xmath106-tensor of the crystal involved in the parametric interaction ( @xmath107 for extraordinary waves ) .",
    "as an input signal pulse , we assume a gaussian profile @xmath108 with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) pulse duration @xmath109 and spectral pulse width @xmath110 . as an example , figs.1(a ) and",
    "1(b ) show the evolution of the pulse intensity profiles @xmath111 and @xmath112 of signal and sum - frequency fields , respectively , in a @xmath1131.5-cm - long ppln crystal as obtained by direct numerical analysis of eqs.(1 - 3 ) , for a signal pulse duration @xmath114 ps of low peak intensity ( @xmath115 w/@xmath116 ) and an intensity of the continuous - wave pump field @xmath117 of @xmath118 , corresponding to @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the numerical results of fig.1 are with excellent accuracy reproduced by the analytical solutions ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , derived in the no - pump depletion limit .",
    "figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) show the corresponding behavior , along the crystal coordinate @xmath55 , of the normalized photon fluence @xmath64 [ inset of fig.1(c ) ] , pulse center of mass @xmath53 of signal field [ solid curve in fig.1(c ) ] , and zb amplitude @xmath121 \\langle \\eta \\rangle_2 ( \\xi)$ ]",
    "[ solid curve in fig.1(d ) ] . in figs.1(c ) and ( d ) , the behaviors of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as predicted by eqs.(28 ) and ( 29 ) , are also shown ( dotted curves , almost overlapped with the solid ones ) . note that , according to the theoretical analysis , the center of mass of the signal pulse undergoes a clear oscillatory motion , superimposed to a slight drift [ arising from the first term on the right hand side of eq.(28 ) ] . for spectrally broader signal pulses , zb can not be accurately described by the simple eqs.(28 ) and ( 29 ) , however the oscillatory motion of the pulse center of mass , superimposed to a drift motion , is still observed in numerical simulations .",
    "this is shown , as an example , in figs.2 and 3 , where pulse duration of the injected signal pulse has been reduced to @xmath124 ps in fig.2 ( corresponding to @xmath125 ) , and to @xmath126 ps in fig.3 ( corresponding to @xmath127 ) . in an experiment",
    ", a measurement of the pulse center of mass at internal planes of the nonlinear crystal could be a nontrivial task , whereas autocorrelation measurements can readily reveal a jitter of the output pulse , at the exit of the crystal , with respect to a reference case .",
    "owing to the dependence of the sinusoidal terms entering in eq.(28 ) on the product @xmath128 , in an experiment the signature of zb can be easier revealed by monitoring the center of mass of the signal pulse at the output plane @xmath129 of the crystal as a function of the pump intensity @xmath27 .",
    "this is shown , as an example , in fig.4 , where the numerically - computed behavior of @xmath76 at the output crystal plane versus the intensity @xmath27 of the pump field is depicted , together with the approximate prediction based on eq.(28 ) . +     for the signal pulse at the output of the ppln crystal versus the intensity @xmath27 of the pump field .",
    "the crystal length is @xmath130 cm , the input pulse duration of the signal field is @xmath114 ps .",
    "the dotted curve in the figure is the behavior of @xmath76 predicted by eq.(28 ) . ]",
    "in this work , a photonic analogue of the trembling motion ( zitterbewegung ) of a free relativistic dirac particle , based on frequency conversion of short optical pulses in a nonlinear quadratic medium , has been presented .",
    "the analogy , which stems from the mathematical similarity between the dirac equation of a massive particle and the coupled equations describing sum frequency generation in the presence of pulse walk - off , indicates that well - known and experimentally accessible nonlinear optical processes could be exploited to simulate the dirac equation in an optical setting .",
    "as compared to other classical and quantum analogues of zitterbewegung recently proposed in the literature , based on trapped ions @xcite , graphene @xcite or photonic crystals , superlattices or metamaterials @xcite , our proposal may show a simpler experimental access and could stimulate further search for nonlinear optics analogues of relativistic quantum phenomena .",
    "for example , engineering of the qpm grating could be exploited to introduce in eq.(17 ) a @xmath67-dependence of @xmath28 , i.e. to simulate the dynamics of a relativistic dirac particle with a time - varying mass @xcite . likewise , if the temporal dependence of the pump pulse is included in the analysis and assuming @xmath131 , an @xmath51-dependence of the mass @xmath28 is introduced in eq.(17 ) , which enables to mimic a relativistic dirac particle in a lorentz scalar potential @xcite . +   + the author acknowledges financial support by the italian miur ( grant no .",
