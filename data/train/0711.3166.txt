    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional skyrme system ( known as the planar skyrme model , or baby skyrme model ) may be viewed as a simple analog of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional skyrme model , and is also of considerable interest in its own right .",
    "this paper is concerned with walls and chains of planar skyrmions .",
    "walls are extended objects of codimension 1 , and chains are extended objects of dimension 1 ; so in the planar skyrme system , walls and chains are both 1-dimensional objects , and they are related , as we shall see below .",
    "in addition to the usual isolated ( 0-dimensional ) skyrmion solutions , various other periodic , extended solutions are known for both the skyrme and the baby skyrme models : for example , a 3-dimensional skyrmion crystal @xcite , a 2-dimensional skyrmion wall , and a planar skyrmion crystal @xcite . but 1-dimensional chains of skyrmions , or of planar skyrmions , have received less attention .",
    "chains of topological solitons have been intensively studied in other systems : for example , chains of instantons ( ` calorons ' ) in the o(3 ) sigma model @xcite and in yang - mills theory @xcite , and chains of bps monopoles @xcite .",
    "a chain may be viewed as a string of solitons , and the dimensionless ratio @xmath2=(intersoliton distance)/(soliton size ) is an important parameter .",
    "when @xmath3 , interesting things can happen : the solitons lose their individual identities , and ` constituents ' may emerge . in the caloron case ,",
    "the constituents are monopoles .",
    "one fundamental difference between chains of skyrmions or baby skyrmions on the one hand , and chains of instantons or monopoles on the other hand , is as follows .",
    "instantons and monopoles do not exert forces on each other , and so the energy - per - period of a chain is independent of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , skyrmions and baby skyrmions may attract or repel each other , depending on their relative orientation ; and so we expect a chain to contract , extend , or exhibit other dynamical properties . of particular interest",
    "are stable chains : that is , chains whose energy can not be lowered by any periodic deformation .",
    "chains of this type might serve as good approximations to finite chains in @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "an outline of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the baby skyrme model and its topology ; in sections 3 and 4 we discuss planar skyrmion walls and chains repectively ; and section 5 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "a planar skyrme ( or baby skyrme ) field is a smooth function @xmath6 from ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space - time to the 2-sphere @xmath7 . in what follows",
    ", we shall restrict to static fields , and think of @xmath6 as a unit vector @xmath8 ; so @xmath9 with @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the usual spatial coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the ( static ) energy density @xmath14 of the field is defined by @xmath15 = \\mathcal{e}_2[\\phi ]         + \\mu\\mathcal{e}_4[\\phi ] + \\mu\\mathcal{e}_0[\\phi ] , % \\mathcal{e}[\\phi ] = \\alpha_2 \\mathcal{e}_2[\\phi ]   %       + \\alpha_4 \\mathcal{e}_4[\\phi ] + \\alpha_0 \\mathcal{e}_0[\\phi],\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and where @xmath17 is a positive constant .",
    "( taking the coefficients of @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be equal fixes the length - scale . )",
    "two commonly - studied choices for the potential @xmath20 are :    * @xmath21 ( the ` old baby skyrme model ' , see eg ) * @xmath22 ( the ` new baby skyrme model ' , see eg )    the energy densities @xmath23 and @xmath18 are invariant under global so(3 ) rotations of the target space @xmath7 , but the choice of potential @xmath20 breaks this symmetry ; in the old and new baby skyrme models , the symmetry group is broken to so(2 ) .",

    ". for isolated skyrmions on @xmath4 , finiteness of energy requires that @xmath27 tends to a constant as @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 can be extended continuously to a map from @xmath7 to @xmath7 , and it therefore has a degree ( winding number ) , called the topological charge @xmath29 .",
    "there is an integral formula for @xmath30 , namely @xmath31=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^2 } \\mathcal{n}[\\phi ] \\ , dx \\ ,",
    "dy$ ] , where @xmath32 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\phi\\cdot(\\partial_1\\phi\\times\\partial_2\\phi)\\ ] ] is the topological charge density .",
    "a standard bogomolny - type argument shows that the topology gives a lower bound on the energy , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the standard integration measure on @xmath7 .    in each of the old and",
    "the new baby skyrme models , there exist isolated @xmath30-skyrmion solutions . for @xmath35 in the old baby skyrme model , and for all @xmath30 in the new baby skyrme model ,",
    "these solutions are rotationally - symmetric : a spatial @xmath36 rotation can be compensated by a rotation of the target 2-sphere .",
    "in fact , these solutions have the o(2)-symmetric ` hedgehog ' form @xmath37 where @xmath38 are polar coordinates on @xmath4 , @xmath39 is a phase angle , and @xmath40 is a function satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "the force between separated skyrmions depends partly on their relative phase .    in the sections that follow",
    ", we shall impose periodicity ( or anti - periodicity ) in @xmath12 , so that the field @xmath6 lives on @xmath44 rather than @xmath4 . by periodic with period @xmath45 we mean that @xmath46 ; while by anti - periodic we mean that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is some element of the global symmetry group so(2 ) satisfying @xmath49 . the topological classification and bogomolny bound extend to these cases , as we shall see below",
    ".    for some choices of potential @xmath20 , the bogomolny bound ( [ bogomolny bound ] ) can be saturated , and the corresponding solutions can be written down explicitly . the procedure for deriving such potentials is well - known , and the details may be summarized as follows .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of the stereographic projection @xmath50 of @xmath27 , given by @xmath51 in addition , we use the complex coordinate @xmath52 .",
    "then the expressions for the topological charge density ( [ charge density ] ) and the energy density ( [ energy density parts ] ) become @xmath53 the existence of the bogomolny bound ( [ bogomolny bound ] ) follows from the identities @xmath54 and the bound is saturated provided that @xmath55 from ( [ sigma model bogomolny equation ] ) we see that @xmath50 has to be a holomorphic ( or rather meromorphic ) function of @xmath56  this corresponds to @xmath50 being a solution of the @xmath57 limit of the system , namely the o(3 ) sigma model .",
    "if we have such a @xmath58 , and we can express @xmath59 in terms of @xmath50 , then ( [ sigma model potential ] ) gives the relevant potential @xmath20 .",
    "examples of walls and chains of this type will be constructed below .",
    "in this section , we consider fields which are periodic in @xmath12 ( with period @xmath45 ) , and which satisfy the boundary condition @xmath60 as @xmath61 . in order to get finite energy",
    ", the potential @xmath20 has to vanish for @xmath62 ; the standard example is therefore the system @xmath1 .",
    "the topological classification is straightforward , and may be described as follows .",
    "the field @xmath27 is defined on the cylinder @xmath44 , but the boundary condition means that the ` ends ' at @xmath63 can be regarded as single points , and therefore @xmath27 represents a map from @xmath7 to @xmath7 .",
    "so it has a degree @xmath64 .",
    "thus the topological ( or magnetic ) charge of a segment of wall of length @xmath65 equals @xmath66 ; note that the examples below all have @xmath67 .",
    "planar skyrmion walls have been studied previously : for example , the authors of investigated the interaction between a skyrmion and an uncharged ( @xmath68 ) wall .",
    "the energy per period @xmath69 , and the integer @xmath70 , are given by @xmath71 & = & \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{0}^\\beta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\mathcal{e}[\\phi ]                  \\,dx^1\\,dx^2 \\\\",
    "k[\\phi ] & = & \\int_{0}^\\beta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\mathcal{n}[\\phi ] \\,dx^1\\,dx^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath72 are defined by the same expressions ( [ energy density ] , [ charge density ] ) as before .",
    "furthermore , the energy @xmath69 is bounded below as in ( [ bogomolny bound ] ) .",
    "one can construct exact solutions by using the procedure described at the end of the previous section . for simplicity ,",
    "set @xmath73 .",
    "the simplest function @xmath58 satisfying the boundary conditions is @xmath74 ; substituting this into ( [ sigma model potential ] ) , and converting from @xmath50 to @xmath6 , gives the potential @xmath75 for this potential , the bogomolny bound is @xmath76 ; the field @xmath74 is a @xmath67 wall solution which saturates this lower bound . in particular",
    ", the wall has a preferred length - per - charge ( or period ) , which in this case is @xmath77 .",
    "( multiplying @xmath20 by a constant has the effect of changing @xmath45 . )",
    "note that the size of an individual soliton is of order 1 , so @xmath45 is essentially the dimensionless ratio @xmath2 mentioned in the introduction .    staying with this potential ( [ domain wall potential ] ) , one can envisage taking a segment of the wall of length @xmath78 in the @xmath12-direction , and joining the ends together to form an @xmath30-skyrmion in @xmath4 .",
    "so one might expect @xmath30-skyrmions in this system to resemble rings of radius @xmath30 , and with energy @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a positive constant ( the @xmath81 term representing a curvature contribution ) . a numerical simulation , assuming the hedgehog form ( [ hedgehog ] ) and finding the profile function @xmath40 which minimizes @xmath26 , reveals that this is indeed what happens . in particular , the energy @xmath82 of @xmath30-skyrmions in the range @xmath83 was computed for @xmath84 , and the values are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "these values are well - fitted by the curve @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the bogomolny bound .",
    "-skyrmion in the system @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    similar ( although slightly less explicit ) features occur for other ` double - vacuum ' potentials , such as @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", one again has a wall solution with a preferred length - per - charge @xmath45 , which now depends on the parameter @xmath17 ; below , we shall derive and plot the expression for @xmath88 .",
    "isolated @xmath30-skyrmions in this system have previously been studied @xcite : they are rings with radii which grow linearly with @xmath30 , and @xmath82 is a decreasing function of @xmath30 , similarly to the previous example .    to calculate of @xmath89 , we assume homogeneity in the @xmath12-direction , by taking the field to have the form @xmath90 here @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is a function satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath93 as @xmath94 and @xmath95 as @xmath96 . note that this wall has @xmath67 ( one unit of charge per period ) , and the energy per period is @xmath97 where @xmath98 this functional @xmath69 satisfies a bogmolnyi - type inequality , namely @xmath99 with equality if and only if the bogomolny equation @xmath100 is satisfied .",
    "this equation can be integrated to give @xmath101 and this implicitly determines the profile function @xmath102 . but without knowing @xmath102 explicitly , one can use ( [ nbswallenergy ] , [ nbswallbog ] ) to obtain an expression for the minimal energy : it is @xmath103,\\ ] ] and this is minimized with respect to variations in @xmath104 if @xmath105 solving ( [ nbswallbeta ] ) for @xmath104 then gives the preferred period @xmath106 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "this function @xmath89 is plotted in figure 2 , for the range @xmath107 , from which one sees that the dependence on @xmath17 is not very strong .",
    "note that @xmath108 as @xmath109 .     of a wall in the system @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , we consider fields which are anti - periodic in @xmath12 , and which satisfy the boundary condition @xmath110 as @xmath61 . we call static solutions satisfying these boundary conditions skyrmion chains , and we shall investigate such chains in the two systems @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the energy @xmath69 and magnetic charge @xmath70 per period are given by the same expressions as before .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that @xmath70 has to be an integer ( since the field is anti - periodic rather than periodic ) , but the following argument shows that it does ( ie @xmath64 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath111 satisfies the anti - periodicity condition @xmath112 we will construct a new field @xmath113 such that @xmath114=k[\\phi]$ ] , and such that @xmath115 is strictly periodic ( with period @xmath45 ) .",

    "the new field is defined as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 the charge density of @xmath116 is @xmath120 & = & \\frac{1}{4\\pi } ( r\\phi ) \\cdot ( r\\partial_1\\phi )                           \\times ( r\\partial_2\\phi + \\partial_2r \\phi ) \\\\                      & = & \\mathcal{n}[\\phi ]       + \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\phi \\cdot \\partial_1\\phi\\times [ r^{-1}(\\partial_2 r)\\phi]\\\\                      & = & \\mathcal{n}[\\phi ]       - \\frac{1}{4\\beta}\\partial_1\\phi_3 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and integrating this gives @xmath121= k[\\phi]$ ] , as claimed , since @xmath122 .",
    "the bogomolny bound ( [ bogomolny bound ] ) holds for skyrmion chains ; as was done previously for walls , one may write down simple configurations @xmath58 which saturate the bound for potentials given by ( [ sigma model potential ] ) .",
    "one possible choice , satisfying the chain boundary conditions , is @xmath123 where @xmath80 is a positive constant .",
    "the potential defined by this field and ( [ sigma model potential ] ) is @xmath124.\\ ] ] this potential @xmath20 has three vacua , at @xmath125 in the limit where @xmath126 , with @xmath127 so that @xmath128 remains constant , we get the potential @xmath129 . this was to be expected , since it is exactly this potential which admits a ` saturating ' 1-skyrmion solution on the plane .      in this subsection , we consider chains in the old baby skyrme model , in other words with potential @xmath0 .",
    "we begin with an analytic approximation describing a chain of well - separated skyrmions ( this corresponds to @xmath130 ) , and then we describe some numerical results .",
    "the @xmath130 approximation is an adaptation of the corresponding one for widely - separated skyrmions in @xmath4 , used in .",
    "it enables one to compute the energy of a collection of skyrmions in terms of their separations and relative phases .",
    "let @xmath131 be two skyrmions ( [ hedgehog ] ) , with phases @xmath132 , expressed in stereographic coordinates ( [ stereographic projection ] ) .",
    "suppose that these two skyrmions are given a separation @xmath133 , and consider the field @xmath134 representing their superposition .",
    "in the limit where @xmath135 , the energy of @xmath50 is twice the energy @xmath136 of a single skyrmion .",
    "one can calculate the leading contribution to the difference @xmath137 - 2e_1,\\ ] ] in the limit where @xmath135 .",
    "the result is that @xmath138 for large @xmath133 , where @xmath139 is the modified bessel function of order zero , and where @xmath140 is a constant related to the decay of the profile function @xmath40 by @xmath141 this constant @xmath140 depends on @xmath17 , and has to be determined numerically : for example , when @xmath142 , one finds @xmath143 . this approximation is called the dipole approximation , because the asymptotic formula for @xmath144 matches the interaction energy of a pair of orthogonal scalar dipoles .",
    "notice that the sign of @xmath144 depends on the relative orientation @xmath145 ; it follows that a pair of aligned skyrmions repel , while a pair of skyrmions with relative phase @xmath146 attract .",
    "this approximation can be adapted to the case of an infinite chain of skyrmions .",
    "we shall do the computation both for in - phase skyrmions ( so that the resulting chain is periodic ) , and for anti - periodic chains where each pair of neighbouring skyrmions has a relative phase of @xmath146 . for each @xmath147 ,",
    "let @xmath148 be a skyrmion located at @xmath149 , with phase @xmath150 .",
    "then the fields @xmath151 are skyrmion chains , with relative phase @xmath152 or @xmath146 according to whether one chooses the upper or the lower sign .",
    "let @xmath153-e_1 $ ] be the interaction energy per period of the chain .",
    "one can show analytically that @xmath154 to leading order , in the limit where @xmath155 .",
    "in fact , in this limit , only the first term in the series ( [ bessel2 ] ) is significant , and so this approximation is really the same as ( [ bessel1 ] ) . as before , @xmath156 is a positive decreasing function , and @xmath157 is a negative increasing function ( for large @xmath45 ) .",
    "so , a chain of well - separated skyrmions will extend if the skyrmions are aligned , and contract if they are anti - aligned .    for the remainder of this subsection",
    ", we restrict to the anti - periodic case , and in particular pose the question : is there a chain with a preferred length - per - charge ?",
    "in other words : which period @xmath45 ( if any ) will minimize the energy @xmath69 ? anti - periodic chains in this system were studied in @xcite by using an ansatz for @xmath27 which , in effect , imposed homogeneity in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "then there is a bogomolny - type argument which yields a formula for @xmath69 , and one can minimize @xmath69 with respect to @xmath45 . the result is plotted in figure 3 ( dashed curve ) , for the system with @xmath84 .",
    ", as a function of the period @xmath45 .",
    "the solid curve gives gives the minimal energy ; the dashed curve gives the energy of a chain which is @xmath12-homogeneous .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    however , the actual solution , for each @xmath45 , is not of this homogeneous type , and the actual energy is lower than that of a homogeneous field .",
    "this minimal energy has to be determined numerically , and the result of such a computation is also presented in figure 3 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the conclusion , therefore , is that a chain of anti - aligned skyrmions in the old baby skyrme system will contract until its period @xmath45 reaches a value which minimizes @xmath69 ; and for @xmath84 this preferred period is @xmath158 , as one sees from figure 3 .",
    "figure 4 depicts the chain at @xmath159 , with plots of the three components @xmath160 as well as the energy density @xmath161 .    , with @xmath84 and @xmath159 .",
    "the field components @xmath160 , and the energy density @xmath161 , are plotted as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , over one period . [ fig4 ] ]    the numerical procedure used in deriving figures 35 is as follows .",
    "the @xmath162-space is replaced by a rectangular grid , with a transformation of @xmath11 to ensure that @xmath61 is included .",
    "the expression for the energy @xmath69 is discretized with finite differences , and is then minimized using a conjugate - gradient method .",
    "richardson extrapolation is used to reduce the error in @xmath69 to significantly less than @xmath163 .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider chains in the new baby skyrme model ; that is , with potential @xmath1 .",
    "the dipole approximation described above works equally well in this case , and the same result is obtained : namely that a chain of anti - aligned skyrmions will contract . as before , we pose the question of whether there is a preferred period @xmath45 corresponding to a minimal - energy chain .",
    "a new feature in this case is that the system also admits wall solutions .",
    "one may construct a field with chain boundary conditions by taking it to consist of a parallel wall - antiwall pair . from this it is clear that there is now a possible decay mode for chains : namely that a chain could split into a wall and an antiwall which separate , and move in the negative @xmath11-direction and the positive @xmath11-direction respectively .",
    "whether or not the wall and antiwall actually do move apart depends on the force between them , and this force can be studied analytically , as follows .",
    "let @xmath164 be a domain wall ( [ nbs wall ansatz ] ) with @xmath165 , with profile function @xmath166 given by ( [ nbs wall profile function ] ) , and located at @xmath167 for some real number @xmath168 .",
    "let @xmath169 be a second domain wall given by ( [ nbs wall ansatz ] ) with @xmath170 , with profile function @xmath171 .",
    "so this second wall is an antiwall , and it is located at @xmath172 .",
    "let @xmath173 and @xmath174 be the stereographic projections of these , as in ( [ stereographic projection ] ) .",
    "finally , define a superposition @xmath50 by @xmath175 the field @xmath50 satisfies the boundary conditions for anti - periodic chain with period @xmath45 , and the charge per unit period is 1 .",
    "this field resembles a parallel wall - antiwall pair , separated by a distance @xmath133 , with @xmath176 between the walls and @xmath177 on either side .",
    "we want the interaction energy @xmath178 - e'[w^{(1 ) } ] - e'[w^{(2)}]\\ ] ] of the superposition , which is a function of @xmath45 and @xmath17 .",
    "now @xmath179 as @xmath155 , and we have calculated the leading contribution to @xmath180 in this limit .",
    "the calculation is similar to that for two isolated skyrmions in , but is more complicated in practice , for the following reason . in the case of two isolated skyrmions ,",
    "the leading contribution is found using an elegant argument based on the euler - lagrange equations ; in the case of two walls , however , the analogous term vanishes , and so we must work to higher order .",
    "we find that @xmath181 provided @xmath182 , where we have written @xmath183 .",
    "so a pair of well - separated domain walls will attract when @xmath184 and repel otherwise .",
    "therefore the approximate prediction is that a chain is stable with respect to separation into two walls provided that its period @xmath45 is greater than the critical value @xmath185 but for @xmath186 chains will decay into separating wall - antiwall pairs .",
    "recall from section 3 that each wall in a well - separated wall - antiwall pair has a preferred period @xmath45 : it is obtained by solving ( [ nbswallbeta ] ) for @xmath104 , and then setting @xmath187 .",
    "( we take @xmath45 to have half the value it had in section 3 , so that the charge - per - period of the wall - antiwall system is @xmath67 . as a consequence ,",
    "the chain is anti - periodic rather than periodic . ) from figure 2 we see that for @xmath84 , the preferred period is @xmath188 . by contrast , ( [ criticalperiod ] ) gives @xmath189 .",
    "so if we begin with a wall - antiwall pair with large @xmath45 , then each wall in the pair will continue to contract until the period reaches @xmath190 , whereupon they will begin to repel each other .    a numerical simulation for the case @xmath84 reveals that this is indeed what happens , with the critical value of the period being only @xmath191 below that predicted by ( [ criticalperiod ] ) .",
    "this result is illustrated in figure 5 , which plots the energy @xmath69 of a chain , numerically - minimized for a range of ( fixed ) values of @xmath45 .     of a chain in the system @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath192 , the chain is unstable .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    the dashed line is the energy @xmath193 of an isolated skyrmion in this system , and so one sees that for @xmath194 each skyrmion in the chain hardly notices its neighbours .",
    "energy can be lowered by reducing the period ( the chain tends to contract ) ; but once the period reaches @xmath195 , the separating - wall instability sets in .",
    "so for chains in this system there is no preferred length - per - charge .",
    "in single - vacuum systems such as @xmath0 , one has chains with a preferred length - per - charge .",
    "they are stable against periodic perturbations ; their stability against more general perturbations has not been investigated here . in double - vacuum systems such as @xmath1 ,",

    "skyrme walls were discussed in , and skyrmions are hollow shells constructed out of this wall material @xcite . introducing a potential can change things : for example , potentials of @xmath196 type @xcite , or of more general type @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the investigations described here to other , related , systems .",
    "for example , in 2 + 1 dimensions , the baby skyrme model is related to abelian higgs models which admit local and semi - local vortices @xcite ; what are the properties of chains and walls in this general family of systems , and their @xmath197 generalizations ? going to 3 + 1 dimensions ,",
