    "in addition to observables such as the top - quark mass and total inclusive top - quark pair production cross section , differential cross sections are also of interest .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1 invariant mass distribution can be used to measure @xmath6 @xcite , and in searches for physics beyond the sm .",

    "the experiments at the lhc are expected to observe millions of top - quark events per year already in the initial low - luminosity phase , bringing the study of top - quark properties into the realm of precision physics . in particular , the total inclusive top - quark pair production cross section is expected to be measured with a relative error of @xmath8 to @xmath9 at the lhc @xcite . to make optimal use of the data",

    "the hard - scattering kernels @xmath12 are related to the partonic cross section and can be calculated as a series in @xmath2 , whereas the @xmath13 are parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the partons @xmath14 in the incoming hadrons and must be extracted from data .",

    "the nlo computations suffer from theory uncertainties larger than @xmath9 , both for tevatron and lhc center - of - mass energies .",
    "these uncertainties are due to our imperfect knowledge of the parton distribution functions , and also to the truncation of the perturbative series in the strong coupling constant , which introduces a dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales into physical predictions .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty is typically reduced by including more terms in the perturbative series , and for this reason the calculation of the differential partonic cross section to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) has been an area of active research @xcite",

    "however , given that our nnlo results are incomplete , it is important to clarify under what conditions they are expected to give a good approximation to the full results . while it is difficult to assign a systematic uncertainty to an unknown correction , we can examine in parallel how well the same approximation works at nlo , and use this as an indication of its expected validity at nnlo .    at nlo",
    "we can compare the following three calculations of the invariant mass distribution :    1 .",
    "the full result , given by the monte carlo program mcfm @xcite .",
    "2 .   the full threshold expansion , which is equivalent to the full result at leading order in @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   the approximate threshold expansion , which is equivalent to the full result at leading order in @xmath19 for the plus distributions and @xmath22-dependent terms , but not in the @xmath22-independent piece of the delta - function term . here we also have the choice of writing the logarithms in the delta - function coefficients in terms of @xmath88 or @xmath87 .",
    "4 .   the approximate threshold expansion , where the delta - function term is neglected entirely .    to the extent that the second , third , and fourth options agree well with the full result at nlo , it would seem plausible that our nnlo result , which is limited to the third and fourth options , might also agree well with the full nnlo result , which is unknown .",
    "we thus investigate these different approximations to the invariant mass distributions for a range of @xmath15 and @xmath22 , and study under what circumstances they show a reasonable agreement",
    ". the naive expectation would be that they agree only at very high values of the invariant mass , since then @xmath100 and the integrand in ( [ eq : sigm ] ) is needed only in the @xmath29 limit .",
    "moreover , the integrals over the plus distributions in ( [ eq : result ] ) are more singular at @xmath101 than the unknown portion of the correction proportional to the delta function . however , due to the rapid fall - off of the pdfs at large @xmath74 , the distribution at very high @xmath102 is difficult to measure",
    ". the most interesting region for phenomenology would be from @xmath103 to around 1 tev at the tevatron and up to several tev at the lhc ; this region of the invariant mass corresponds to @xmath104 . in order for our results to be a good approximation in this region ,",
    "it is necessary that the luminosity functions @xmath105 fall off so fast for @xmath106 that only the largest values of @xmath53 give significant contributions to the integrand in ( [ eq : sigm ] ) . in that case ,",
    "a dynamical enhancement of the partonic threshold region may occur , even if @xmath102 is not close to unity @xcite .",

    ", we see that the threshold expansion is in good agreement with the full result even at values @xmath103 , where @xmath112 , and gets progressively better at higher values of @xmath15 .",
    "the situation is only slightly worse for the lhc with @xmath113  tev , even though the value of @xmath102 for a given @xmath15 is about 25 times smaller .",
    "we also note that at lhc energies the threshold expansion matches the exact result better at the higher value of @xmath114 than at @xmath115 . in what follows",
    ", we shall also explore the scale choice @xmath116 .",
    "since such a choice is not practical in the monte carlo program mcfm , from now on we shall use the exact threshold expansion to represent the full nlo result , keeping in mind the good agreement seen in figure  [ fig : mcfm ] .",

    "however , we must also observe from figure  [ fig : scalevarm ] that at nlo the perturbative uncertainty estimated by varying the scale in the range @xmath120 in the approximate threshold expansions is actually smaller than in the complete threshold expansion at both @xmath121  gev and @xmath122  gev at the lhc .",

    "in section [ sec : pheno ] we performed a numerical study of the @xmath1 invariant mass distribution at tevatron and lhc energies . in both cases , we noted the expected decrease in scale uncertainty after including the nnlo corrections , and also noticeable changes in the central values , especially at higher values of the invariant mass . given that our nnlo result is still incomplete , even in the threshold region , part of our analysis was focused on determining how well the analogous approximation works at nlo .",
    "we observed that at nlo the full result in qcd and its exact threshold expansion agree fairly well .",
    "the same was true of the approximate threshold expansion at nlo , where the scale - independent pieces of the delta - function term are neglected .",
    "this provides some evidence that the steep fall - off of the pdfs at large @xmath74 induces a dynamical enhancement of the partonic threshold region , which would mean that the terms we have calculated at nnlo provide a useful approximation to the full result .",
    "our finding that the nnlo perturbative corrections , which we have calculated in this letter , have quite an important impact in the region of large invariant masses , as seen in figure  [ fig : kbands ] , provides a strong motivation for improving this estimate with more sophisticated calculations .",
    "we expect that the scale dependence indicated by the width of the various bands in the figure can be reduced significantly by resumming the partonic threshold logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "based on the results presented here and in @xcite , such a resummation is now possible at nnll order .",
