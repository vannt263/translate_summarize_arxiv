    "they play different role in forming superconductivity , in particular in magnetic properties under an applied field , such as symmetry of vortex lattices@xcite or the form factors probed by small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) experiments@xcite . to understand its detailed magnetic response , a two band model is indispensable .",

    "the in - plane and @xmath45 axis coherence lengths @xmath43 are 660 and 33 ( @xmath46 ) , respectively  @xcite . thus for any combinations @xmath41 is well satisfied .",
    "we also notice that the lattice constants @xmath47=3.862@xmath46 and @xmath45=12.722@xmath46 are short enough compared with those coherence lengths , thus sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a three dimensional normal metal .",
    "moreover , most physical quantities , including various transport coefficients and thermodynamic properties can be consistently and coherently described by a fermi liquid theory as explained in details by mackenzie and maeno  @xcite .",

    "based on the microscopic eilenberger theory extended to a multiband case , we have studied the mixed state properties of a uniaxial anisotropic type ii superconductor , focusing on the interplay between the pauli paramagnetic effect and multiband effect .",
    "a two band model calculation is set up and applied to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "we have succeeded in reproducing the data both of the form factors of sans experiments  @xcite and magnetic torque experiment  @xcite .",
    "that leads us to the conclusion that to understand the physics in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 it is indispensable to consider both the pauli paramagnetic effect and multiband effect simultaneously , which conspire to give rise to a variety of mysteries associated with the pairing symmetry determination in this material .",
    "as agreed with the previous identification based on the single band analysis  @xcite , the pairing symmetry in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is either singlet which is most likely or triplet with the d - vector locked in the @xmath15 plane which is less likely . the @xmath6 ( @xmath4 )",
    "band is major ( minor ) with the mass anisotropy 60 ( 180 ) .",
    "namely , the @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) band has a lager ( smaller ) gap .",
    "the gap structure is a full gap in the @xmath6 band while in the @xmath4 band it is @xmath7 like .",
    "this simple picture was difficult to reach because of the extreme two - dimensionality of this material which prevents conventional experimental access .",
    "now the dedicated and refined experimental tools  @xcite which are able to align the magnetic field direction accurately within 1@xmath287 enable us to uncover the physics of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
