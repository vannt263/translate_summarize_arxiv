    "means that we replace the terms in eq .   by their unperturbed values which are all zero  apart from the diagonal ones , @xmath62 .",

    "however , the origin of the noise which drives the diffusion is nevertheless ultimately quantum mechanical rather than classical and hence it makes sense to see as a semiclassical equation in this context .",
    "it is worth noting that a fokker - planck equation with the same form emerges in the analysis of coupled lasers far above threshold@xcite .    now that we have obtained an expression for the phase distribution in the semiclassical limit we can look in detail at when and how its predictions differ from the full ( quantum ) dynamics predicted by the master equation .",

    "the first thing to note is that the standard expectation of classical synchronization theory is fulfilled : for the weak couplings used here a rather strong change in the phase distribution is combined with a relatively weak change in the average occupation number of the system .",
    "furthermore , the semiclassical phase distribution does a reasonable job of describing the strength of the peak in the phase distribution for @xmath24 values that are not far above threshold .",

    "[ fig : sc1]a .",
    "although the phase locking is pretty weak for larger values of @xmath24 , it is nevertheless about twice as strong as predicted by the simple semiclassical calculation .",
    "although a full numerical solution of the master equation becomes very difficult for larger @xmath9 values we can use perturbation theory to calculate the relative phase distribution provided that we choose a small enough value for the coupling ( since it turns out that the range of coupling strengths over which the second order perturbation calculation is a good description varies with @xmath9 ) .",
    "[ fig : sc2 ] compares the value of @xmath113 obtained using the perturbation and semiclassical calculations for a range of @xmath9 values .",
    "it shows clearly that the semiclassical solution provides an increasingly accurate description of the strength of the phase locking as @xmath9 is increased , just as one would expect .",
    "we now turn to look at how other measures of correlations , mutual information and entanglement , behave as a function of the type and strength of the coupling between micromasers .",
    "recent work on coupled quantum van der pol oscillators has suggested that there may be an intimate connection between the emergence of synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators and the behavior of the mutual information@xcite and it has even been suggested that mutual information could serve as an order parameter for synchronization@xcite .    the mutual information , @xmath114 , of the coupled micromasers is defined as @xmath115 where @xmath0 is the full density operator , @xmath116 , is the reduced density operator of micromaser @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath119 $ ] .",

    "however , for both cases the entanglement remains very weak , even in the strongly quantum regime of very low photon numbers .",
    "we have investigated synchronization effects in coupled micromasers using the relative phase distribution as a tool to quantify the emergence of preferred relative phases .",
    "we used perturbation theory to show that dissipative coupling between the micromasers leads to a @xmath53-periodic relative phase distribution whose peak grows linearly with the coupling .",

    "the relative phase distribution seems to be a very useful tool for describing synchronization effects in the quantum regime .",
    "we were able to derive a fokker - planck equation to describe its dynamics in the semiclassical regime , where photon numbers are large , leading to a steady - state distribution which depended on just the coupling strength and the linewidth of the uncoupled micromaser .",
    "this derivation also showed quite clearly that the phase dynamics would be much more complicated in the quantum regime where photon occupation numbers are low .",
    "indeed , comparisons of numerical calculations using the full master equation showed that the fokker - planck equation substantially underestimated the strength of the features which emerge in the relative phase distribution in the quantum regime .",
    "interestingly , a very similar underestimate of synchronization effects was obtained using a semiclassical model for the case of two van der pol oscillators@xcite . in our case",
    ", it seems that low photon occupation number is the key factor that leads to differences between quantum and semiclassical predictions .",
    "we also investigated the behavior of the mutual information of coupled micromasers and found that the behavior was rather different to that of the relative phase distribution .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising as the relative phase distribution depends on a very specific combination of a sub - set of the elements of the full density matrix of the system .",
    "whilst all forms of correlation can be expected to increase with coupling , at least initially , it seems unlikely that other measures of correlation between the oscillators will increase in precisely the same way as the relative phase distribution .",
    "our work could serve as a starting point for a number of future studies .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to explore synchronization in the bistable regime where the micromasers exist in a mixed state consisting of limit - cycles with two different amplitudes .",
    "another possibility would be to explore synchronization effects in systems with more than two micromasers .",
    "the perturbation approach that we used here could prove a useful tool in analysing systems with a handful of coupled oscillators where a numerical solution of the full master equation already becomes very challenging because of the potentially very large state space involved .",

    "<S> we investigate synchronization effects in quantum self - sustained oscillators theoretically using the micromaser as a model system . </S>",
    "<S> we use the probability distribution for the relative phase as a tool for quantifying the emergence of preferred phases when two micromasers are coupled together . using perturbation theory , we show that the behavior of the phase distribution is strongly dependent on exactly how the oscillators are coupled . in the quantum regime where photon occupation numbers are low we find that although synchronization effects are rather weak , they are nevertheless significantly stronger than expected from a semiclassical description of the phase dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the behavior of the phase distribution with the mutual information of the two oscillators and show that they can behave in rather different ways . </S>"
