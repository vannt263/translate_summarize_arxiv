    "the multistate landau - zener ( lz ) problem is to determine transition amplitudes among @xmath0 discrete states after time evolution from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in systems described by the schdinger s equation with linearly time - dependent coefficients @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constant @xmath6 matrices .",
    "any such a system can be transformed by a time - independent change of the basis into its canonical form , in which the matrix @xmath5 is diagonal and the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath4 are nonzero only between eigenstates of @xmath5 with different eigenvalues .",
    "eigenstates of the matrix @xmath5 are called the _",
    "diabatic _ states .",
    "they transfer into eigenstates of the hamiltonian when time is approaching @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , for a finite number of coupled nondegenerate diabatic states , the scattering matrix can be defined .",
    "arbitrary element @xmath8 of such an @xmath6 matrix @xmath9 is the amplitude of the diabatic state @xmath10 at @xmath11 , given that at @xmath12 the system was at the state @xmath13 .",
    "the related matrix @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is called the matrix of transition probabilities .",
    "studies of multistate landau - zener models ( mlzms ) were pioneered by the article of majorana @xcite in which , in addition to an independent discovery of the landau - zener formula @xcite , he showed that any solution of a spin-1/2 problem in time - dependent magnetic fields , including the lz - model , can be generalized to the solution for dynamics of an arbitrary spin in the same magnetic field .",
    "hence , the majorana s article @xcite provided the transition amplitudes in the mlzm with the hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath9 is the arbitrary size spin operator .",
    "perhaps , the most unusual findings about the system ( [ mlz ] ) are the so called brundobler - elser formula @xcite and the no - go theorem @xcite that provide expressions for some elements of the transition probability matrix in _ any _ model of the type ( [ mlz ] ) , suggesting that a strong progress in understanding complex mlzms can be achieved .    today",
    ", there is no general recipe to determine all transition amplitudes in a complex mlzm analytically . in order to achieve this",
    ", one would have to consider higher than 2nd order systems of differential equations with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , a number of exact results @xcite , fully solvable nontrivial systems @xcite , and methods to study mlzms @xcite of the type ( [ mlz ] ) have been discovered .",
    "some of the solved models were used in applications to condensed matter systems @xcite .    here",
    "we add two models to the class of the worked - out solvable mlzms .",
    "our models correspond to transitions on a semi - infinite chain of sites with a possibility of pair - wise jumps between neighboring sites .",
    "specifically , we will provide transition probabilities for two models of type ( [ mlz ] ) , whose schrdinger s equations for amplitudes read : .3truecm @xmath17    @xmath18 with constant parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and where @xmath0 is the set of nonnegative integer numbers .",
    "the reason why both models are solvable is because their hamiltonians are quadratic when they are written in terms of bosonic creation / annihilation operators , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , if we identify states @xmath23 with eigenstates of the boson number operator @xmath24 , then the model-1 is the schrdinger s equation for state amplitudes with the hamiltonian @xmath25 and model-2 is reproduced from the evolution of two coupled oscillators : @xmath26 under the condition that the initial population of the mode @xmath21 is equal to the initial population of the mode @xmath27 .",
    "both models , ( [ hm1 ] ) and ( [ osc ] ) , have an important practical realization .",
    "they describe a dynamic passage through a phase transition in a system of a molecular bose condensate interacting with cold atoms near the feshbach resonance .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is usually written as @xcite :    @xmath28 , \\label{gh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the diatomic molecule annihilation operator and @xmath29 is the annihilation operator of a single atom with momentum @xmath30 and spin @xmath31 ; @xmath0 is the number of atoms and @xmath20 describes the strength of the conversion of atoms into molecules near the resonance .",
    "model-1 appears in the limit when atoms are in a macroscopic condensate state so that their operators can be treated as constant c - numbers .",
    "it describes creation of a molecular condensate beyond the mean - field assumption for the molecular field @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , it can be applied to the experimentally important case with zero initial number of molecules .",
    "model-2 corresponds to the opposite process of a decay of a molecular condensate into atomic modes . in this case",
    ", one assumes that the system has initially macroscopic number of bose condensed molecules that pass through the feshbach resonance and split into pairs of atoms with initially close to zero populations .",
    "both models ( [ hm1 ] ) and ( [ osc ] ) have been studied previously for application to the transition through the feshbach resonance @xcite , however , the focus was either on the average number of molecules / atoms converted during the process or on the evolution from the ground state .",
    "in this work we will explore the exact statistics of the number of defects ( i.e particles in a new phase ) created during the evolution starting from an _ arbitrary _ initial state , and stressing universality and scaling in the full probability distribution of the possible outcomes of the sweeping through a phase transition process .",
    "the structure of our article is as follows . in sections",
    "ii and iii , we derive the state - to - state transition probabilities in , respectively , model-1 and model-2 . in section iv , we discuss possible applications of our results in the theory of dynamic quantum phase transitions .",
    "appendix a is devoted to the numerical study of the symmetry of the transition probability matrix that we initially observed in solutions of our models and then claimed that it is actually the property of all mlzms in linear chains .",
    "we summarize our results in conclusion .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model-1 can be easily transformed into the hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator with a time - dependent force .",
    "such systems were very well studied previously for various applications .",
    "for example , one can engineer the hamitonian of such a system in an array of optical couplers and , literarily , observe the evolution of transition amplitudes with  time \" @xcite .    to simplify our notation ,",
    "first , we reduce the number of parameters by rescaling : @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "next , we remove strongly oscillating phase factors at @xmath34 by changing the basis @xmath35 which does not change the transition probabilities . after these transformations",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ hm1 ] ) is @xmath36 we will search for the solution of the corresponding schrdinger s equation in the form of a coherent state ansatz : @xmath37 substituting this vector in equation @xmath38 and collecting separately c - terms near @xmath39 and @xmath40 we find a pair of equations :    @xmath41    with initial conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , they have solutions @xmath44    for the time - evolution from minus to plus infinity , this gives us @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "hence , if the initial state is a coherent state , @xmath47 , the state after the transition becomes    @xmath48    a specific case of an initial state without defects : @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 , and eq . ( [ coh44 ] ) gives the wave function in the form @xmath51 which is a coherent state with @xmath52 . from @xmath53 , we can explicitly read the transition amplitudes between states @xmath54 and @xmath13 as @xmath55 , and transition probabilities are explicitly given by @xmath56 the number of defects ( i.e. molecules in the created molecular condensate ) has the poisson distribution ( [ p00n ] ) with the average number @xmath57 .",
    "returning to the parametrization ( [ hm1 ] ) , we find @xmath58 , i.e. the average number of defects scales as @xmath59 with the sweeping rate .",
    "two additional consequences follow from the knowledge of the full distribution ( [ p00n ] ) . first , the poisson distribution has all equal cumulants , so that this scaling is valid not only for the average number of defects but also for their variance , skewness and so on .",
    "the second observation is that the probability of not creating any defect depends exponentially on the inverse sweeping rate @xmath19 : @xmath60 later , we will return to this observation and claim that this behavior is , in fact , more general than the scaling of the number of defects with the sweeping rate through a phase transition .    in order to determine transition probabilities between any pair of levels @xmath13 and @xmath10",
    ", we use the fact that any state @xmath23 can be written as a superposition of coherent states @xmath61 as    @xmath62    combining this with ( [ coh4 ] ) we find that the state vector that starts as @xmath23 transforms into    @xmath63    for the transition amplitude to the state @xmath64 with @xmath65 we find @xmath66 respectively , for @xmath67 we find @xmath68    transition probabilities @xmath15 can be compactly written in terms of the known special functions : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the n - th laguerre polynomial and @xmath71 is the associated laguerre polynomial . in fig .",
    "[ m1-check ] we compare predictions ( [ probs ] ) with our direct numerical simulations of ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "results appear to be in a perfect agreement with each other .",
    "interestingly , amplitudes of transitions @xmath8 and @xmath72 are different only by a phase factor , which corresponds to the symmetry of the transition probability matrix : @xmath73 this fact is quite surprising considering that there seems to be no obvious symmetry in the evolution equation of the model that would lead to ( [ psn ] ) .",
    "in fact , our numerical simulations show that this property is _ generic _ i.e. it is found in all mlzms in finite and infinite linear chains",
    ". we will discuss this property in more detail in appendix .    ) for ( a ) transition probabilities from the state @xmath54 to the state @xmath13 at @xmath74 ; ( b ) transition probabilities from the state @xmath75 to the state @xmath13 at @xmath74 .",
    "time evolution is from @xmath76 to @xmath77.,width=326 ]    some transition probabilities with lowest @xmath13 and @xmath10 are explicitly given by @xmath78 it is useful to compare this list of transition probabilities with the ones for other known mlzms .",
    "thus , in all known exact solutions with a finite number of states , e.g. @xcite , transition probabilities can be expressed as finite polynomials of exponents @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , respectively , off - diagonal couplings and slope differences between pairs of diabatic states @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in another extreme ,",
    "the exact solution of the mlzm in an infinite chain with constant couplings @xcite returns transition probabilities in terms of the bessel function : @xmath84 .",
    "our model-1 shows features of both these classes .",
    "transition probabilities contain an exponent @xmath85 but , unlike the known solved finite size mlzms , this exponent is multiplied by polynomials of @xmath86 rather than exponents of this combination .",
    "in order to solve model-2 , we adopt a different strategy @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the amplitude generating function @xmath87 .",
    "after rescaling , @xmath32 and @xmath88 , eq . ( [ h2 ] ) becomes a linear partial differential equation in terms of @xmath89 : @xmath90 \\partial_{z } u = -igzu , \\label{u1}\\ ] ] which can be solved by the method of characteristics , leading to equations : @xmath91 @xmath92 .",

    "we will assume that @xmath95 .",
    "the second initial condition is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the value of @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "substituting ( [ aa ] ) into ( [ c1 ] ) we also find @xmath100    equation ( [ aa1 ] ) has two solutions with leading asymptotics at @xmath101 : @xmath102 the wronskian of such two solutions is equal to unity : @xmath103 . substituting ( [ as ] ) into ( [ as2 ] )",
    "we find that    @xmath104    hence , @xmath105 in particular , this allows us to express @xmath97 in terms of @xmath106 that is the value of @xmath98 at @xmath2 :    @xmath107    assuming that the system starts on the level @xmath23 , we have @xmath108 . substituting this into ( [ u2 ] ) we find @xmath109 . \\label{u3}\\ ] ] from ( [ u3 ] ) and ( [ zz ] ) , we obtain for @xmath110 :    @xmath111    ) for ( a ) transition probabilities from the state @xmath54 to the state @xmath13 at @xmath112 ; ( b ) transition probabilities from the state @xmath75 to the state @xmath13 at @xmath113 .",
    "time in numerical simulations changes from @xmath114 to @xmath115.,width=326 ]    asymptotics of ( [ aa1 ] ) at @xmath116 are known @xcite .",
    "their non - vanishing contributions read : @xmath117    it is possible to simplify the generating function @xmath118 by noticing that the multiplication of @xmath119 by any complex number with a unit absolute value is equivalent to a mere phase transformation of all amplitudes @xmath120 , which does not influence the transition probabilities .",
    "similarly , multiplication of @xmath121 by an arbitrary phase factor , only shifts phases of @xmath120 but not their absolute values .",
    "the time - dependent factors , @xmath122 , can be moved in front of @xmath121 and the remaining time - dependent phase can be absorbed by @xmath119 .",
    "same can be applied to all factors @xmath123 , @xmath82 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 in ( [ as4 ] ) .",
    "the remaining trimmed generating function of transition amplitudes from the state @xmath23 to any other state then explicitly reads :    @xmath126    in particular , by setting @xmath127 in ( [ u4 ] ) and taking the square of the result we find the probability of a transition from the state @xmath128 into the empty state @xmath129 : @xmath130 which is the geometric distribution . from the previous studies of this model @xcite we know that each defect that was present at the initial state creates , on average , an exponentially large number of new defects , @xmath131 .",
    "equation ( [ pn0 ] ) shows that despite this tendency the transition probability into the empty state decays relatively slowly with the initial number of defects .",
    "also , the result appears to be similar to the known solutions of mlzms with a finite number of states in the sense that it depends only on the simple powers of @xmath132 .    according to ( [ pn0 ] ) ,",
    "the probability of creating no defects if the evolution starts at the ground state is given by a simple exponent : @xmath133 where we again recalled that @xmath134 in order to highlight the exponential dependence of @xmath135 on the inverse sweeping rate @xmath136 , which is usually a directly controlled parameter in experiments .",
    "if the evolution starts with the ground state @xmath129 then @xmath137 expanding ( [ uu4 ] ) as a taylor series we obtain the individual transition amplitudes .",
    "taking their absolute square values we obtain transition probabilities from @xmath54 to all states in a closed form : @xmath138 this particular distribution ( [ ppn ] ) , but not the full amplitude generating function ( [ u4 ] ) , was previously found in @xcite by a different approach . comparing ( [ ppn ] ) and",
    "( [ pn0 ] ) we again find the symmetry @xmath139 .",
    "figure  [ m2-check ] shows a perfect agreement of the analytical prediction of ( [ u4 ] ) with our numerical simulations .",
    "below , we also provide some explicit transition probabilities with lowest initial and final state indexes : @xmath140 again , we always find the symmetry of the transition probability matrix : @xmath141 .",
    "modern studies of non - adiabatic effects during a passage through a quantum phase transition often concentrate on the almost adiabatic regime , in which a system almost reaches the new ground state after the sweep of a control parameter through a phase transition @xcite .",
    "nonadiabatic corrections in such a process are substantial only for small energy excitations defined by the sweeping rate @xmath19 . for systems with a continuous spectrum they result in scaling of the number of excitations ( defects ) with @xmath19 .",
    "such a nearly adiabatic regime is usually hard to achieve in macroscopic and even mesoscopic quantum systems .",
    "there are many experimentally reported counterexamples to the naive application of the landau - zener formula to mesoscopic / macroscopic systems . thus , an adiabatic sweep of a magnetic field through the paramagnetic phase of an ensemble of initially polarized dipole - coupled nano - magnets usually leads to demagnetization rather than the transition to the ground state with the opposite polarization @xcite .",
    "similarly , the conversion efficiency of an atomic condensate into molecules after the passage through the feshbach resonance is often close to @xmath142 rather than @xmath143 at the lowest temperatures in the adiabatic limit @xcite . such deviations from the landau - zener theory",
    "have been explained , in particular , by the sensitivity of the adiabatic limit of the landau - zener formula to various decoherence effects @xcite , which are generally present in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems , and by the breaking of the adiabatic approximation by many - body interactions @xcite .",
    "the models that we solved in previous sections correspond to a different regime of a relatively fast sweep throughout a new phase . in this regime ,",
    "the initial phase is mostly preserved during the process , however , the number of defects ( molecules in model-1 and atomic pairs in model-2 ) can be large so that collective effects in their dynamics play the role .",
    "such a regime is much less vulnerable to decoherence @xcite due to much smaller time allowed for decoherence effects to accumulate , as well as due to specific robustness of the landau - zener processes to noise effects in this limit @xcite .",
    "we found that the probability distributions of the number of defects in this regime can be distinctly nonclassical .",
    "consider , for example , a classical stochastic model of markovian independent particle creation with a constant rate .",
    "the number of particles in such a process has the poisson distribution with the mean @xmath144 and an exponentially small probability of creating zero number of particles @xmath145 . in contrast , for model-2 , it has been shown in @xcite that if the passage through the phase transition starts with no defects , then @xmath146 , while we showed here that @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148 , which is dramatically different from the stochastic particle creation case .",
    "for example , if on average we observe 1000 defects , then it would be sufficient to repeat the experiment @xmath149 times to observe an event without a defect creation , while it would take @xmath150 trials to observe such an event if particles were generated by a classical stochastic process without memory .",
    "our exact result shows that this property of the enhanced transition probability to the empty state persists even when the initial state is already populated with a number of defects .    in studies of the quantum mechanical regime of a fast passage through a phase transition",
    ", the probability to create no defects should play a special role also for the reason of its universal scaling with the inverse sweeping rate @xmath136 .",
    "( [ p00 ] ) and ( [ pp0 ] ) show that the probability @xmath151 is the same in two models with very different behavior of other transition probabilities .",
    "this fact is not a coincidence but rather a direct consequence of the brundobler - elser formula @xcite , which was initially found in numerical simulations @xcite and which by now is a mathematically rigorously proved result in the multi - state lz theory @xcite . according to this formula",
    ", if the system starts its evolution from the ground state and evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ mlz ] ) in time from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , then the probability to remain in the same diabatic state is given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the coupling between the state @xmath129 and the excitation state @xmath154 , and where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the slopes of diabatic levels of these states .",
    "the summation is over all diabatic microstates of the system .",
    "if a new phase is passed by changing the control parameter ( such as an external magnetic field acting on a system of spins ) from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with some rate @xmath19 and if diabatic energies ( elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath5 in ( [ mlz ] ) ) of all diabatic states depend linearly on the control parameter then we have @xmath157 for any state @xmath82 , where parameters @xmath158 do not depend on the sweeping rate .",
    "the survival probability then satisfies a universal scaling law : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a constant , @xmath161 .",
    "measurements of this constant by measuring @xmath151 can reveal a useful information about the coupling of the initial ground state to its excitations at the phase transition .",
    "we would like to stress again that the scaling law ( [ pt ] ) is expected to be truly universal and not restricted by the conditions of the theory of the adiabatic passage through a quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "it should be valid for any linear passage through a region with a phase transition either with or without an exact level crossing point . in mesoscopic systems , such as atomic bose condensates",
    ", the probability @xmath151 can be made sufficiently large for measurements by increasing the sweeping rate @xmath19 .",
    "we determined state - to - state transition probabilities in two multistate landau - zener models , which have practical relevance for the theory of dynamic passage through a feshbach resonance .",
    "we highlighted the importance of the probability to generate zero number of defects by showing that it can be exponentially enhanced in quantum systems in comparison to classical memoryless stochastic processes and that it shows the universal scaling @xmath162 as the function of the sweeping rate @xmath19 through the phase transition .",
    "our solutions also revealed the symmetry of the transition probability matrix that we explored numerically in appendix for a set of finite chain models .",

    "we found that _ all _ our numerical tests supported the hypothesis ( [ sym ] ) in mlzms of the type ( [ nchain ] ) .",
    "the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) is _ not _ a simple consequence of some trivial symmetry of ( [ nchain ] ) .",
    "an example of a trivial symmetry is the statement that in any system ( [ nchain ] ) transition probabilities depend only on absolute values of coupling constants , @xmath198 .",

    "another trivial fact is that transition probabilities depend only on differences of the level slopes @xmath204 , which follows from the fact that a uniform shift of all @xmath193 by a constant @xmath19 , @xmath205 for @xmath206 , is merely equivalent to the time - dependent phase shift @xmath207 .",
