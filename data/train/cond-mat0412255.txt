    "considerable interest has been attracted recently to the properties of simple gases ( noble gases and small molecules ) adsorbed near bundles of carbon nanotubes.@xcite this subject has been reviewed recently.@xcite the adsorption of these gases can occur within the tubes only if they are open , which is possible either during the process of nanotube formation ( e.g. , when endohedral c@xmath3 molecules are formed ) ,  @xcite or after chemical treatment to open the tubes.@xcite the presence , or absence , of interstitial channel ( ic ) molecules is an open question in the case of an idealized bundle of identical tubes ; there seems to be no doubt , however , that such ic adsorption occurs in laboratory samples of polydisperse tubes.@xcite in contrast to variability in adsorption at these sites , the adsorption of gas on the external surface of the bundle is a ubiquitous phenomenon , in which the film coverage increases with the pressure ( @xmath4 ) of the coexisting gas . in that exohedral environment , an adatom is strongly attracted to the groove region between two neighboring tubes",
    "; there , the film forms a quasi - one - dimensional phase .",
    "further adsorption at low temperature ( @xmath5 ) is predicted to manifest a so - called three - stripe phase of gas aligned parallel to the grooves.@xcite at higher gas coverage ( @xmath6 ) , there occurs a two - dimensional monolayer phase , qualitatively analogous to that found on the graphite surface.@xcite at even higher coverage , a multilayer film grows as @xmath4 increases .",
    "there is an upper limit of total film coverage , set by the bundle s curvature;@xcite this limit has yet to be explored .",
    "this study extends a previous investigation  @xcite of the adsorption of ar gas on the external surface of a nanotube bundle .",
    "argon was chosen as a model adsorbate because its gas - gas interaction is well known , making it a standard fluid in the study of simple fluids . in the previous study ,",
    "denoted i , we employed the grand canonical monte carlo simulation method to explore the evolution of the equilibrium film as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the present paper , stimulated by recent and proposed experiments , adds three results to those derived in the previous study .",
    "one property is the specific heat , @xmath0 , which is computed here from energy fluctuations , evaluated using simulations within the canonical ensemble .",
    "the second property is the differential heat of adsorption , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy of the film .",
    "this quantity is closely related to another quantity , which is more often measured experimentally , the isosteric heat @xmath9 [ where @xmath10 , by the relation  @xcite @xmath11 ( assuming an ideal gas coexisting with the film ) .",
    "the third property reported here is the anisotropic correlation function of the overlayer .",
    "this quantity is related by fourier transform to results of diffraction experiments . with the exception of the isosteric heat calculated by shi and johnson,@xcite",

    "when not explicitly contradicted in this paper , it may be assumed that the physical system and computational method are as described in i. the primary model system is a bundle of infinitely long , cylindrically symmetric carbon nanotubes of identical radii equal to 6.9  ",
    ". only two adjacent nanotubes on the external surface of the bundle are simulated .",
    "the @xmath13 axis is parallel to the nanotubes , and the @xmath14 axis is directed away from the surface of the bundle .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath15 and @xmath13 directions ( approximating the surface of the bundle as an infinite plane of nanotubes ) ; reflecting boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath14 direction . the unit simulation cell",
    ", whose volume contains half of each of the two adjacent nanotubes with the groove in between them at the center , is 17   in the @xmath15 direction , 34   in the @xmath13 direction , and 40   in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "the simulations were done in the canonical ensemble , rather than the grand canonical ensemble more commonly used in adsorption simulations , in order to facilitate the calculation of the heat capacity .",
    "two markov chain monte carlo simulation methods were used , the metropolis algorithm  @xcite and the wang - landau algorithm.@xcite the metropolis algorithm was used to calculate configurational observables , such as density distributions and correlation functions .",
    "the wang - landau algorithm was used to calculate thermodynamic observables expressible in terms of ensemble averages or their derivatives , such as specific and isosteric heat , for certain @xmath6 ; the metropolis algorithm was used to determine the full @xmath6 dependence .",
    "the metropolis algorithm proposes new configurations and accepts them with a probability equal to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the probabilities of the old and new configurations @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; this acceptance rule causes the random walk to converge to the probability distribution @xmath17 . by choosing @xmath17 proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath21}$ ] , where @xmath22 is the potential energy of the configuration , the metropolis algorithm uniformly samples configuration space . for the metropolis simulations of each @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 monte carlo moves were discarded during the initial equilibration to converge the algorithm to the boltzmann distribution , then @xmath25 moves were generated , from which @xmath26 samples were drawn to perform simulated measurements of system observables .",
    "the wang - landau algorithm , like the metropolis algorithm , also proposes and accepts configurations with a probability equal to @xmath16 .",
    "however , it chooses @xmath17 to be proportional to @xmath27 = 1/g[u(\\textbf{x})]$ ] , where @xmath28 is the ( relative ) density of states , thus uniformly sampling _ energy _ space ( instead of configuration space , as in the metropolis algorithm ) .",
    "it dynamically refines its estimate of the density of states by counting each visit to a state of a given energy @xmath29 ( or , rather , within a small range of energies @xmath30 $ ] about an energy bin @xmath31 of width @xmath32 ) , and multiplies its running estimate of @xmath33 by a constant factor @xmath34 .",
    "it continues the random walk until each energy is visited approximately uniformly ( a `` flat histogram '' of visits in energy space ) , whereupon it reduces the factor @xmath35 and starts another iteration .",
    "the algorithm terminates when @xmath34 is reduced to a preset minimum greater than unity , with values closer to unity yielding more accurate estimates of the density of states .",
    "once an estimate of @xmath28 is produced , it can be used to calculate the partition function directly @xmath36 thermodynamic quantities can then be calculated from the partition function , as usual .",
    "one advantage of the wang - landau algorithm over the metropolis algorithm ( and the main reason for using it for this study ) is that , because temperature dependence appears only in the boltzmann weight @xmath37 and not in the density of states @xmath28 itself , a single simulation of @xmath28 can calculate thermodynamic observables for all temperatures at once .    some modifications and improvements to the original published wang - landau algorithm",
    "were implemented .",
    "boundary effects were properly handled.@xcite to adapt the original lattice - based algorithm to continuum systems , preliminary metropolis runs at low temperature were performed to estimate a lower bound on the energy bins ( i.e. , the ground state energy).@xcite the simulation can also become trapped for long periods of time in regions of high degeneracy , so that energies with small @xmath28 go a long time before being revisited . to remedy this , the energy bins can be broken up into overlapping subranges ; ergodicity can be achieved more rapidly if the interval of energies to be traversed is smaller .",
    "separate simulations are performed in each subrange , producing independent estimates of @xmath28 .",
    "some care must be taken in combining them into an estimate of @xmath28 over the full energy range : because each simulation calculates only the _ relative _ density of states , the estimates will not generally match up at the boundaries of the subranges . to overcome this",
    ", each subrange estimate of @xmath28 is rescaled by a constant factor that minimizes the least - square error in @xmath38 wherever two neighboring subranges overlap in energy.@xcite this corresponds to choosing normalizing factors @xmath39 that minimize the sum @xmath40}-\\log{[g_{n-1}(u_i)]}\\}^2 $ ] over the overlapping bins @xmath31 ( where @xmath41 denotes the density of states simulated over subrange @xmath42 ) , and then rescaling @xmath43 by @xmath39 .    for the wang - landau simulations of each @xmath6 , 1500 equal - sized energy bins were used in a range [ @xmath44,0 ] , where @xmath44 is the ground state energy .",
    "the 1500 bins were divided into four overlapping subranges , simulated separately , consisting of the bins numbered 1150 , 76787 , 7131425 , and 13511500 .",

    ", one observes that the correlations within the three - stripe phase are weaker and even more @xmath5 dependent than those in the groove phase . at 90  k , at higher coverage ( seen in the middle four panels ) , the stripes are not as straight , primarily due to transverse excitation ( as discussed in sec .",

    "although the system studied here differs from that experiment in geometry , we expect the melting temperature of the monolayer in our system to similarly increase with density",
    ". the corrugation of the nanotube bundle should elevate the melting temperature somewhat compared to a planar surface , as the grooves will serve to more strongly confine the film s structure .",
    "bienfait  _ et al_.  have measured diffraction patterns for ar on nanotube bundles.@xcite probably due to heterogeneity ( for which there exists evidence in bare surface diffraction ) , the diffraction data are not easily interpreted",
    ". there is , however , definite evidence of 1d interatomic spacing ( i.e. , a peak at wave vector @xmath57 ) at low coverage and 2d close - packed spacing ( peak near @xmath58 ) .",
    "the isochoric specific heat , @xmath59 , i.e. , the heat capacity ( per particle ) at constant volume , was calculated from ensemble averages .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the heat capacity can be given in terms of energy fluctuations , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes an expectation taken over the canonical ensemble .",

    "given the density of states @xmath28 calculated with the wang - landau algorithm , the expectations may be calculated from @xmath64 , and similarly for @xmath65 .",
    "the heat capacity was also estimated directly from the derivative @xmath66 by means of a finite difference approximation .",
    "these latter estimates , while consistent with the fluctuation estimates , were `` noisier '' and are not considered further in this paper .    the simulated @xmath0 for the groove , three - stripe , and monolayer phases is shown in fig .",

    "the cylindrical volume enclosed by an isopotential goes like @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , which is a constant ; indeed , the @xmath75 calculated in fig .  [",

    "the rectangular volume enclosed by an isopotential goes like @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , which goes like @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "this divergence in the model accounts qualitatively for the peak in @xmath75 just above the monolayer energy of about @xmath97  k. for high energies dominated by the vapor phase , we can treat the substrate as a semi - infinite rectangular volume , and approximate the external potential by a long - distance ( @xmath98 ) lennard - jones potential integrated over this region , which yields @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath75 will go like @xmath100 , qualitatively accounting for the sharp rise in @xmath75 as @xmath101 .",
    "given the volume density of states @xmath75 , we can then obtain the energy probability density @xmath78 at any other temperature by scaling this temperature - independent function by the appropriate boltzmann weight .",

    "the specific heat is near 3  boltzmanns .",
    "a contribution of 2.5  boltzmanns is accounted for by the same argument as for the low density limit .",
    "unlike the low density limit , however , the groove phase is densely packed with adatoms , and interparticle interactions must be considered .",
    "an additional @xmath73  boltzmann arises from confinement in the longitudinal dimension , for which the ar - ar interaction potential is approximately harmonic at its minimum when the adatoms are stably distributed in equilibrium .",
    "as the temperature increases , evaporation out of the groove begins . at @xmath104",
    "k , evaporation is great enough to excite adatoms out of the groove ; while not many of these atoms reach the monolayer region ( table  [ tab : uext ] ) , there is still a large change in potential energy for a small increase in temperature , and thus a large specific heat .",
    "the specific heat then decreases slightly with increasing temperature , since the change in energy is not as large once the initial adatoms have begun to be promoted .",
    "this low - temperature peak is not present in the low - density case because , as seen in both table  [ tab : uext ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : corr - xy ] , the adatoms are not spread transversely as greatly about the immediate groove region at low temperatures in the low - density case as they are in the groove case .",
    "however , in a manner qualitatively analogous to the low - density limit , an additional , larger peak in the specific heat is found at still higher temperatures ( @xmath105  k ) , mostly from promotion from the groove into the stripes and the rest of the monolayer .    like the groove phase",
    ", the three - stripe phase starts out at 3  boltzmanns at low temperatures , similar to the groove phase , except that the 1  boltzmann from external potential confinement in the transverse plane is replaced by 1/2  boltzmann from external potential confinement normal to the surface , and 1/2  boltzmann from interparticle confinement along the surface in the transverse plane .",
    "the specific heat peaks near @xmath106  k ; this is not due to a significant fraction of particles being promoted from the groove to the stripes , as one might expect , but rather to a wider range of energies within the stripe / monolayer region , and promotion from the stripes to the rest of the monolayer ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : uext ] and table  [ tab : uext ] .",

    "the monolayer phase also starts out at 3  boltzmanns at low temperatures , for reasons analogous to the three - stripe phase . at higher temperatures ,",
    "there is a peak in the specific heat near @xmath108  k which , like the three - stripe peak , is largely due to a broadening of the particles across a range of energies in the monolayer region , as well as some promotion from the monolayer to the bilayer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uext ] ) .",

    "is the rapid rise in the specific heat near @xmath110 , just before groove completion , as @xmath5 goes from 60 to 90  k. this is attributed to promotion out of the groove .",
    "similarly , near monolayer completion the marked increase in @xmath12 with @xmath5 is attributed to thermal promotion out of the monolayer .    it is also illuminating to study the differential heat of adsorption , @xmath111 , the energy required to adsorb an additional particle onto the surface at constant temperature . the differential heat is related to the heat capacity at constant density , @xmath112 , by a maxwell relation derived from the total derivative @xmath113 , which yields @xmath114 ( note that @xmath115 in the canonical ensemble . )    the differential heat of adsorption is summarized in fig .",

    "this agreement with our calculations suggests that their bundles were more homogeneous than those studied in the other two experiments .",
    "it should be noted , however , that their isosteric heat continues to decrease as coverage increases , whereas our isosteric heat appears to rise slightly as the monolayer is approached .",
    "the isosteric heat of wilson _",

    "et  al_.for ar exhibit two plateaus in the dependence of the isosteric heat on coverage .",
    "the lowest coverage data yield @xmath125  kj / mol , or about 1800  k. our predicted value in this range is of order 1650  k. the higher coverage , broad plateau corresponds to a measured @xmath126  k , which agrees well with the value we find for the three - stripe phase .",

    "another area of disagreement is the extent , in coverage , of these plateaus . in the data ,",
    "the second plateau extends over a coverage range comparable to that of the first plateau . our calculations , instead , find that groove region of high @xmath127 extends over just one - sixth of the range of the combined three - stripe plus monolayer regime ( grouped together because of similar values of @xmath127 ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be attributed to the role of large interstitial cavities within the bundle , as argued by bienfait  _ et  al_.",
    "our results are intended to stimulate further experimental studies of this system and analogous systems involving other gases on nanotube bundles .",
    "we have investigated the variation of thermodynamic properties with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "one of the more interesting general results is that the specific heat is typically larger than might have been expected from either simple models used to treat these systems ( either independent particles or a solid )  @xcite or from experimental results for films on graphite.@xcite for most conditions studied here , the specific heat exceeds three boltzmanns , with average values in the range four to five boltzmanns .",
    "in contrast , the specific heat of independent particles  @xcite in this environment is less than three boltzmanns , except at high @xmath5 ( above 100  k ) , when the particles are excited out of the groove .",
    "the large values found in these simulations arise from the fact that the highly corrugated potential surface presents a sequence of excitation steps ( groove@xmath128three - stripe@xmath128monolayer@xmath129vapor ) , each of which enhances the specific heat .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat shows a characteristic double - peak structure .",
    "all densities show a large peak near 175  k , corresponding to promotion of adatoms out of the groove into the monolayer region .",
    "the groove , three - stripe , and monolayer phases show an additional peak at lower temperature , corresponding to a thermal broadening in the range of external potential energies of the particles , rather than to any significant promotion of particles into qualitatively different regions .",
    "other principal results involve the relation between the evolution of film structure ( with increasing @xmath6 ) and the corresponding thermodynamic and correlation functions .",
    "as the groove begins to fill ( @xmath6 approaching 9 ) , the heat capacity shows a dramatic jump as a function of coverage .",

    "our study has been fully classical , but the temperatures beneath which quantum effects become significant can be estimated.@xcite we estimate that quantum effects can be ignored above about 80  k ( see appendix  [ sec : qm ] ) .",

    "modifications to the heat capacity from quantum mechanics at very low energies are given by debye theory:@xcite we expect that @xmath130 as @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , where @xmath133 for the groove and @xmath134 for the monolayer , if the density is high enough to form a bulk phase .",
    "to evaluate quantum effects accurately would require application of the path integral monte carlo method to the problem.@xcite    we note , also , that an experimental heat capacity cell has a volume on the order of 110  @xmath135 , whereas our simulation volume was on the order of @xmath136  @xmath135 .",
    "our simulation , focusing on small volume nearer the adsorbed film , thus ignores almost all of the volume in which desorption into vapor can occur .",
    "this causes the simulation to underestimate the heat capacity that will be experimentally measured .",
    "the effects of desorption can not be ignored when the number of atoms in the vapor starts to approach the number of atoms in the film ; this occurs at roughly 2550  k ( see appendix  [ sec : desorption ] ) .",
    "particularly interesting results from the correlation function studies include the reduced longitudinal correlations in the groove and striped phases as @xmath5 rises above 60  k. these results would be amenable to testing by diffraction experiments even if the samples included a randomly oriented batch of nanotubes ; this is a familiar problem dealt with in powder averaging of small - sample experiments .",
    "this paper studied a system of identical nanotubes .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath0 to nanotube heterogeneity , with an asymmetric groove region between nanotubes of different sizes , is a potentially interesting subject for future investigation.@xcite    we are very grateful to david goodstein for a helpful explanation of the thermodynamics of adsorption , to oscar vilches for a discussion of experimental issues , to mary  j. bojan for discussions of the simulation methods and their interpretation , and to michel bienfait for his helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation .",
    "the upper bound on the temperature at which quantum effects must be considered is dominated by the physics of the deepest energy well , i.e. , the groove .",
    "we can obtain one estimate by considering the minimum energy of longitudinal phonons in the groove in debye theory , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the force constant of a quadratic approximation to the minimum of the ar - ar interaction potential , a 12 - 6 lennard - jones potential @xmath140 $ ] , with @xmath141   , @xmath142  k for ar .",
    "the corresponding energy is 27  k. this estimate considers only ar - ar interactions and ignores the external potential ; we can obtain a complementary estimate by ignoring the interactions and considering only the external potential .",
    "we return to the crossover model of the groove , outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : heat - cap ] , as a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator with a force constant @xmath84  k / @xmath85 . treating it now as a _ quantum _ harmonic oscillator",
    ", it is excited at an energy @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 is the atomic mass of argon .",
    "the corresponding energy of this second estimate is 77  k. taking the larger of the two as a conservative estimate , we expect that quantum effects can be ignored above about 80  k.",
    "we can estimate the temperature at which desorption into the full volume of an experimental cell becomes significant , by determining when the ratio @xmath146 of atoms in the vapor to atoms in the monolayer becomes significant . extending the crossover model",
    ", we can consider the monolayer and vapor phases as separate systems , the monolayer modeled as a surface with a harmonic normal potential , and the vapor modeled as a free gas .",
    "the ratio @xmath146 is then given by the ratio of their respective partition functions @xmath147}}\\,.\\ ] ] we take the first integral between zero and the cell height , @xmath148 ; the second integral may be safely taken between zero and @xmath149 , in the interests of finding an analytic solution .",
    "this gives @xmath150 the fraction of atoms in the vapor above which desorption should be considered `` significant '' is ambiguous , but we might take it to be 10%20% . solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : vap - mono ] ) for @xmath103 , using @xmath151  cm and the values for @xmath152 and @xmath153 found in sec .",
    "[ sec : heat - cap : low - density ] , this corresponds to a temperature in the range of 2550  k.    this calculation neglects interparticle interactions .",
    "their inclusion would lower the estimate of the temperature at which desorption from the monolayer into vapor becomes significant , analogously to how the evaporation from the groove to the monolayer takes place at a lower temperature when the groove is packed  the interacting case  than when it is sparsely populated and the adatoms are effectively noninteracting .",
    "this is supported by the data in table  [ tab : uext ] : more groove@xmath128monolayer promotion occurs for @xmath51 at @xmath154  k than for @xmath69 at the comparable temperature @xmath155  k , indicating that the groove promotion begins at a lower temperatures for the interacting @xmath51 than for the noninteracting @xmath69 .                              s.m .",
