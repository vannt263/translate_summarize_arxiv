    "the cmssm is completely defined at the electroweak scale in terms of @xmath9 , the scalar mass @xmath10 , the gaugino mass @xmath11 , the trilinear coupling @xmath12 and the two phases , @xmath13 , @xmath14 when we require radiative symmetry breaking @xcite . even in this simple model with strict universality , due to the existence of two yukawa matrices",
    "non simultaneously diagonalizable , some flavor mixing leaks through rge into the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "in fact , in the sckm basis , any off - diagonal entry in the sfermion mass matrices at @xmath15 will be necessarily proportional to a product of yukawa couplings . in the up ( down ) squark mass matrix the up ( down ) yukawas will mainly contribute to diagonal entries while off  diagonal entries will be due to the down ( up ) yukawa matrix .",
    "this means , for instance , that in this model the off - diagonality in the @xmath16 matrix will roughly be @xmath17 . where @xmath18 is a proportionality factor that , in order of magnitude , is roughly @xmath19 as expected from the loop factor and the running from @xmath20 to @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", it is also clear that these flavor changing entries in the down squark mass matrix will be very stable with @xmath9 , as for @xmath21 the up yukawa matrix is approximately the same for any @xmath9 .",
    "for the same reasons , the @xmath9 dependence is very strong in the up squark mass matrix because the down yukawa matrix grows linearly with @xmath9 for large @xmath9 .",
    "all these are well  known facts in the different studies of fcnc processes in the framework of the cmssm @xcite and imply that flavor mixing is still dominantly given by the usual ckm mixing matrix in w - boson , charged higgs and chargino vertices .",
    "in this analysis we are specially interested on cp violating observables , and then we must also consider the presence of observable phases in the sfermion mass matrices . in the following",
    "we take @xmath22 to isolate pure effects of the new supersymmetric phases on cp violating observables .",
    "then , before rge evolution the susy phases ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are confined to the left - right part of the sfermion mass matrix while both the left - left , @xmath23 , and right - right , @xmath24 , are real diagonal matrices .",
    "however this is not strictly true anymore at @xmath15 : @xmath13 leaks into the off - diagonal elements of these hermitian matrices through rge evolution . from the explicit rge in the mssm @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that this phase only enters the @xmath25 evolution through the combinations @xmath26 or @xmath27 . at @xmath20",
    "these matrices have a common phase and so the combination @xmath28 is exactly real .",
    "so , to the extent that the @xmath29 matrices keep a uniform phase during rge evolution no phase will leak into the @xmath30 matrices .",
    "however , this is not the case and different elements of the @xmath29 matrices are renormalized differently . at @xmath15",
    "the general form of this matrix in terms of the initial conditions is , @xmath31 where the coefficients @xmath32 are @xmath33 matrices with real numerical entries . in this expression",
    "we can see that the presence of imaginary parts will be linked to the non - symmetric part of the @xmath34 matrices .",
    "we have explicitly checked that these non - symmetric parts of @xmath35 are present only in one part per @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this situation was also found by bertolini and vissani in the cmssm without new phases for the leakage of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "so , we conclude that in the processes we will consider we can take the @xmath38 and @xmath39 as real to a very good approximation .",
    "in the sm neutral meson mixing arises at one loop through the well  known @xmath40box . however , in the cmssm there are new contributions to @xmath41 processes coming from boxes mediated by supersymmetric particles .",
    "these are , charged higgs boxes ( @xmath42 ) , chargino boxes ( @xmath43 ) and gluino - neutralino boxes ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "the amount of the indirect cp violation in the neutral meson @xmath46 system is measured by the well  known @xmath47 parameter , and it depends on the matrix elements of the @xmath41 hamiltonian , @xmath48 , @xmath49 where the operators are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here ,",
    "@xmath53 for the @xmath54 and @xmath55systems respectively and @xmath56 are color indices .",
    "these are the only three operators present in the limit of vanishing @xmath57 .",
    "the three operators in eq ( [ df=2 ] ) are very different with respect to the flavor mixing in the sfermion mass matrices . the operator @xmath58 preserves chirality along the fermionic line while the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 change chirality .",
    "this means , for instance , that gluino contributions to @xmath61 will not need a chirality change in the sfermion propagator and hence will involve mainly the @xmath39 submatrix , real to a very good approximation .",
    "the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 always involve a change in the chirality of the external quarks and consequently also a change of the chirality of the associated squarks or gauginos .",
    "this implies the presence of the new supersymmetric phases .    in first place",
    "we will consider the wilson coefficient @xmath61 .",
    "all the different supersymmetric boxes contribute to this operator .",
    "both the usual sm @xmath40box and the charged higgs box do contribute to @xmath61 , however , in the absence of ckm phase , they can only contribute to the mass difference @xmath62 , but never to the imaginary part in @xmath63 . in the gluino contribution",
    "the source of flavor mixing is not directly the usual ckm matrix , but it is the presence of off  diagonal elements in the sfermion mass matrices discussed in the previous section . working in the sckm basis",
    "all gluino vertices are flavor diagonal and real .",
    "this means that in the mi approximation we need a complex mass insertion in one of the sfermion lines .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that these mass insertions are real in one part per @xmath64 .",
    "the values for the real and imaginary parts of the mass insertions required to saturate @xmath62 and @xmath65 are , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . taking into account",
    "the relation found in the previous section between real and imaginary parts , respecting the bound on the real part implies that no sizeable contributions to @xmath65 can be found .",
    "the situation in @xmath68@xmath69 mixing is completely analogous .",
    "the chargino can also contribute to @xmath70 . in this case flavor",
    "mixing comes explicitly from the ckm mixing matrix and flavor mixing in the sfermion mass matrices plays only a secondary role . in the approximation of no intergenerational",
    "mixing in the sfermion mass matrices we have @xcite , @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 represent the coupling of chargino and squark @xmath75 to left  handed down quarks .",
    "all these couplings and the loop function @xmath76 can be found in @xcite . from eq.([chwc ] ) , taking into account that @xmath77 is symmetric under the exchange of any pair of arguments we can easily see that this contribution is exactly real .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the presence of intergenerational mixing in the sfermion mass matrices does not modify this fact at an observable level .",
    "imaginary parts appear at least two orders of magnitude below the corresponding real parts .",
    "hence we will not consider them here , more details will be given in a complete paper @xcite .",
    "now we analyze the contributions to the @xmath78 and @xmath79 wilson coefficients .",
    "the charged higgs box contributes only to @xmath59 , but once again the absence of phases prevents it to contribute to @xmath80 .",
    "gluino boxes contribute both to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , however flavor change will be given in this case by a left - right mass insertion that in the cmssm is always proportional to the mass of the right handed squark .",
    "this mass insertions have phases @xmath81 but the mass suppression will not be compensated in any case by a large value of @xmath9 .",
    "this means that gluino contributions will always be smaller than the corresponding chargino ones",
    ".    the most important contribution will usually be the chargino box . before the inclusion of qcd effects it contributes solely to the coefficient @xmath79 . at first approximation ckm",
    "produces directly all the necessary flavor change , then we have , @xmath82\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 the coupling of chargino and squark to the right  handed down quark @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we have used ckm unitarity and degeneracy of the first two generation squarks . in this case , due to the differences between the @xmath86 and @xmath87 couplings this contribution is always complex in the presence of susy phases .",
    "recently we showed in a short letter @xcite , that this contribution could be relevant for @xmath80 in the large @xmath9 regime .",
    "however , in that work we did not take into account the additional constrains coming from @xmath2 decay . in the next sections",
    "we will analyze the relation of @xmath80 with this decay , and the constrains imposed by the experimental measure .",
    "the decay @xmath2 has already been extensively studied in the context of the cmssm with vanishing susy phases @xcite . being the branching ratio a cp conserving observable , the presence of new phases will not modify the main features found in @xcite .",
    "however we will see that the experimental measure will also have a large impact on the imaginary parts of the decay amplitude .",
    "this decay is described by the following @xmath89 effective hamiltonian @xmath90 where the different operators involved are @xmath91 that contributes directly to the decay and @xmath92 and @xmath93 , that contribute through rge running .",
    "here @xmath94 , and the photonic and gluonic penguins receive contributions from @xmath95 boson , charged higgs @xmath42 , chargino @xmath43 , neutralino @xmath45 , and gluino @xmath44 loops .    among these contributions ,",
    "the @xmath40 penguin is exactly the same as in the sm and does not depend on any supersymmetric parameters .",
    "similarly , the charged higgs penguins only depend on @xmath96 from the new susy parameters .",
    "the expressions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "then , we have also diagrams mediated by neutralinos and gluinos .",
    "flavor change in this diagrams is due to the off  diagonality in the sdown mass matrix .",
    "however , this flavor change is always smaller than direct ckm mixing and being a left ",
    "right off  diagonal mass insertion is suppressed by @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , smallness of the neutralino and gluino contributions has already been established in @xcite where it was shown that , in the cmssm , such contributions are roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the chargino contribution .    the most important supersymmetric contribution will be in a large part of the parameter space the chargino contribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this diagram , the chirality change can be made both through a chargino mass insertion in the loop or an external leg mass insertion proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "we are then mainly interested in the chargino mass insertion . in terms of the chargino  quark ",
    "squark couplings used in the previous section , these contributions are , @xmath100 where the loop functions are defined by @xmath101/x$ ] and @xmath102 with the functions @xmath103 in @xcite .",
    "once more we use ckm unitarity and degeneracy of the first two generations of squarks .",
    "we can see in this expression that the enhancement due to @xmath104 is partially compensated by the presence of the @xmath105 yukawa coupling in @xmath106 , @xcite",
    ". however this contribution will still be too large for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "if we compare eqs .",
    "( [ chwcr ] ) and ( [ char ] ) we can see that , except the presence of different loop functions and possibly different yukawa couplings of the down quarks , both chargino contributions to the @xmath79 and @xmath107 wilson coefficients are deeply related .",
    "in fact , the couplings @xmath108 only depend on the down quark @xmath85 through its yukawa coupling @xmath109 .",
    "if we make a rough approximation and we take all the loop functions in the sum equal for both @xmath79 and @xmath107 we would obtain that @xmath79 is exactly the square of @xmath107 times @xmath110 . naturally , this is not at all a good approximation , but we can expect that the order of magnitude of @xmath79 is determined by the allowed values of @xmath107 .    following @xcite , it is possible to constrain in a model  independent way new physics contributions to the wilson coefficients at @xmath15 . in terms of these wilson coefficients",
    "@xmath111 is , @xmath112 + 0.156 re[\\xi_{8 } ] + 0.083 re[\\xi_{7}\\xi_{8}^ { * } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 , and the values of the different coefficients are taken from @xcite .",
    "then , with the experimental measure , @xmath114 , we can constrain the allowed values of the complex variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "in fact , we can already see from eq .",
    "( [ constrain ] ) , that in the approximation @xmath117 , this is simply the equation of an ellipse in the @xmath118$]@xmath119 $ ] plane . in the case of supersymmetry the new physics contribution to @xmath115 and @xmath116 will be mainly due to the chargino contributions as we have discussed in the previous section .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath120 constrain then directly the chargino contributions to @xmath121 and indirectly the values of @xmath122 .    in figure 1",
    "we show a scatter plot of the allowed values of @xmath123 versus @xmath124 in the cmssm for a fixed value of @xmath125 with the constrains from eq .",
    "( [ constrain ] ) . the fact that now @xmath120 and @xmath126 are independent does not modify strongly the shape of the plot .",
    "this value of @xmath9 could give rise to observable cp violation @xcite .",
    "however the shape of the plot is clearly independent of @xmath9 , only the number of allowed points and its location in the allowed area depend on the value of @xmath9 considered .",
    "figure 2 shows the allowed values for the re  scaled wilson coefficient @xmath127 corresponding to the same parameter space points shown in figure 1 .",
    "as expected the allowed values for @xmath128 are close to the square of the values of @xmath107 in figure 1 slightly scaled by different values of the loop functions .",
    "we can immediately translate this result to a constrain on the size of the chargino contributions to @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath129\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , for @xmath65 we have @xmath130 and this implies that @xmath131 .",
    "then in this simple model , even with large susy phases , @xmath65 will be mainly given by the usual sm box .",
