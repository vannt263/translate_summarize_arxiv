    "since the discovery of colossal magnetoresistive effects , the study of perovskite manganites ln@xmath0a@xmath8mno@xmath2 ( ln = la@xmath5 , pr@xmath5 , ... ; a = ca@xmath9 , sr@xmath9 , na@xmath4 , k@xmath4 , ag@xmath4 , ... ) received considerable interest due to fascinating fundamental physics as well as due to their potential applications . among these compounds , the la@xmath0ag@xmath8mno@xmath2 is of great interest because of its high magnetoresistance at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the reported results indicate that the solubility of the ag@xmath4 in the lamno@xmath2 is limited and the maximum solubility was reported to be at @xmath10=0.25 @xcite , or @xmath10=0.166 @xcite , above which a magnetic perovskite phase and a nonmagnetic metallic silver will be present . nevertheless , some authors believe that the monovalent ag@xmath4 is not substituted at the la@xmath5 site in the lamno@xmath2 structure @xcite .",
    "the nd@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites have also been studied recently by tang et al .",
    "@xcite and srivastava et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported spin - glass - like behavior and enhanced low filed magnetoresistance in this system .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study the ag doping in the other rare - earth manganites such as prmno@xmath2 . +",
    "the prmno@xmath6 is an antiferromagnet with a nel temperature , @xmath11 , of 99 k @xcite .",
    "studies of monovalent cations ( na , k ) doped prmno@xmath6 systems have been reported previously @xcite .",
    "in contrast , to the best of our knowledge , there are no published results on the physical properties of the pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 series . in the present study , we are interested in the systematic study of the ag doping and understanding its role in the prmno@xmath2 manganite . to investigate the ag substitution at the pr site at low doping contents ,",
    "a pr - deficient sample pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 , was also prepared for comparison with the low ag doped samples .",
    "polycrystalline samples of pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath10=0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 ) and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 manganites were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction route .",
    "stoichiometric mixtures of high purity pr@xmath13o@xmath14 , ag@xmath15o and mno@xmath15 powders were calcined at 900 @xmath16c for 20 h. the resulting powders were then pressed into pellets and annealed in air at 910 @xmath16c for 20 h and then at 950 @xmath16c for 24 h with intermediate grinding .",
    "the obtained powders were ground , pelletized , and sintered at 1110 @xmath16c for 24 h , then slowly cooled to 945 @xmath16c and finally cooled in the furnace to room temperature . + the structural characterization of the samples was carried out using a philips xpert x - ray diffractometer .",
    "rietveld analysis of the xrd patterns were done with the `` profile matching with constant scale factor '' calculation mode of the fullprof package @xcite .",
    "the real ( @xmath17 ) and imaginary ( @xmath18 ) parts of ac susceptibility were measured using a lakeshore 7000 susceptometer .",
    "the dc resistivity measurements were performed by the standard four - probe method using a closed cycle helium refrigerator .",
    "the xrd results show that all of the pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath10=0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 ) and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 manganites crystallize in the _ pnma _ space group with o-orthorhombic type of unit cell distortion ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the o-orthorhombic distortions are characteristic for orbitally ordered manganites . fig .",
    "1 shows a typical xrd pattern along with rietveld refinement for sample @xmath10=0.10 .",
    "in addition to the major phase , the diffraction peaks of metallic silver ( 2@xmath20=38.2@xmath16 and 44.4@xmath16 ) and a weak peak corresponding to mn@xmath2o@xmath21 ( 2@xmath20=36.2@xmath16 ) were detected in the xrd patterns for @xmath220.15 . as seen from the inset of fig .",
    "1 , the intensity of silver peak increases with increasing of doping content for @xmath220.15 .",
    "all samples fulfill the criterion @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 characteristic of a cooperative jahn - teller deformation @xcite .",
    "the doping content dependence of the distortion parameter ( defined as @xmath26 @xcite ) and unit cell volume is shown in fig .",
    "2 . from this figure , it is seen that the unit cell volume and distortion parameter of samples @xmath10=0.05 and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 are obviously larger than the corresponding values of other samples .",
    "the lattice parameters at room temperature , determined from rietveld analysis , are summarized in table i. as seen from the table , the difference between samples @xmath10=0.05 and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 and the rest is mainly induced by lattice parameter @xmath27 . in fact , comparing of the lattice parameters of sample @xmath10=0.05 with the other pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 samples show that there is a elongation of mno@xmath13 octahedra along the @xmath27 direction accompanied with a counter effect of contraction along the @xmath28 direction . the lattice parameter @xmath29 does not change significantly relative to lattice parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "similar behaviors have been observed by srivastava et al .",
    "@xcite in the nd@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 series .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of the @xmath17 for pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 samples , measured in an ac field of 5 oe with frequency of 111 hz , is presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath30 curve for @xmath10=0.0 shows a peak at 83 k. such behavior of the @xmath30 is connected with the onset of magnetic canted structure @xcite . in the undoped sample ( i.e. prmno@xmath31 ) , the oxygen nonstoichiometry induces the presence of mn@xmath32 ions with holes in the e@xmath33 band . in the pr@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 (",
    "a = ca , sr , ba , na , k ) systems the canted arrangement is shown to exist when the content of the mn@xmath32 ions is in the range of 5 - 15% @xcite . for @xmath10=0.05",
    ", a ferromagnetic component appears in the @xmath17 at around 119 k ( fig .",
    "4 ) , in addition to the low temperature peak at 81 k corresponding to canted magnetic structure . a curie - weiss ( @xmath34 ) )",
    "fit of the @xmath30 ( not shown here ) in the temperature range above t@xmath35 and t@xmath36 yields positive curie - weiss temperatures of @xmath37 + 118 k and @xmath38 + 82 k , indicating ferromagnetic interactions at the both transition temperatures of sample @xmath10=0.05 .",
    "the susceptibility behavior of sample @xmath10=0.05 indicates a strong competition between the superexchange and double - exchange mechanisms . for the higher doping contents , @xmath220.10 ,",
    "the @xmath30 increases rapidly as @xmath7 is approached from above , passing through a maximum at a temperature somewhat below @xmath7 . by using of the @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath7 values were found to be 126 , 129 , 130 and 127 k for @xmath10=0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 and 0.25 respectively . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , the behavior of the @xmath30 for pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 is similar to that of sample @xmath10=0.05 . both of them display a ferromagnetic component at about 119 k followed by a peak at lower temperature corresponding to canted structure .",
    "coexistence of ferromagnetic and canted phases in these two samples is consistent with the results in the pr@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( a = ca , sr , ba , na , k ) systems . in theses systems ,",
    "when the percentage of the mn@xmath32 is in the range of 15 - 20% , the canted arrangement coexist with a ferromagnetic arrangement @xcite .",
    "+ the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite show evidence that the ag@xmath40 is not substituted at the la@xmath5 site in the lamno@xmath6 structure . here for the pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 , the metallic ag peaks appear in the xrd patterns for the higher doping contents ( inset fig .",
    "1 ) . to investigate the ag substitution at the pr site at low doping contents ,",
    "it is useful to compare sample pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 with lowest doped sample i.e. pr@xmath41ag@xmath42mno@xmath2 .",
    "neutron diffraction study on the pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 showed the presence of a canted spin arrangement with a significant jahn - teller distortion @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the distortion parameter of sample pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 is obviously larger than the other samples .",
    "significant difference between both the unit cell volume and distortion parameter of samples @xmath10=0.05 and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 and other samples indicate the similarity between unit cell characteristics of these two samples . in other side , the @xmath30 data show similar magnetic behaviors for both of them ( fig .",
    "4 ) . based on such similarities",
    ", one may expect that sample @xmath10=0.05 contains vacancies at the pr site , similar to the pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 .",
    "this means that the ag@xmath40 is not substituted at the pr@xmath5 site in the crystal structure of the prmno@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , similarity between samples @xmath10=0.05 and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 , appearance of metallic silver peaks in the xrd patterns for the higher doping contents and the published results on the la@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites @xcite allow us to conclude that the ag@xmath40 can not substituted for the pr@xmath5 in the prmno@xmath2 structure .",
    "therefore , it is located at the grain - boundaries in the form of metallic silver which is not detectable by conventional xrd at low doping contents .",
    "similar to the la@xmath0mno@xmath2 @xcite , vacancy creation at the pr site is limited and thus at a certain level of doping the pr@xmath0mno@xmath2 structure is no longer stable . consequently , minor amount of a second phase due to mn@xmath2o@xmath21 was detected in the xrd patterns for the higher doping contents .",
    "+ so , why the ferromagnetic phase is enhanced with the increase of nominal ag content ? .",
    "@xcite proposed that the decomposition of ag@xmath43o at high temperatures can efficiently increase the oxygen content of the nominal la@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites .",
    "oxygenation of manganite grains modify the ratio mn@xmath5/mn@xmath32 and lead to the enhancement of @xmath7 .",
    "the ag@xmath43o decomposes at about 300 @xmath16c @xcite to metallic ag and o@xmath15 in the first step of multi - step solid state reaction route .",
    "_ so , in order to better understand the nature of @xmath7 enhancement , one needs to consider the interaction between oxygen and metallic silver_. the silver - oxygen system has been studied extensively in the past , due to its fundamental interests and technological applications .",
    "it has been known that oxygen is often present in metallic silver in multiple states including atomic , molecular and subsurface states .",
    "such various oxygen species ( were labeled as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ... ) have different characteristics and some type of them may be stable and not desorbs up to above 900 k @xcite .",
    "also , it was shown that one half of the lattice oxygen inside subsurface layers of ag@xmath43o is transformed to subsurface oxygen in metallic silver characterized by a quasimolecular structure , and thermal annealing up to 1000 k did not result in the removal of the residual subsurface oxygen @xcite . as a result",
    ", we proposed that the enhancement of @xmath7 up to 130 k is due to the oxygen release from the metallic silver at high temperatures or may be due to the oxygen release from the molten silver when the sintering temperature exceeds the melting point of silver ( 960 @xmath16c ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ag@xmath43o acts as an in situ oxygen donor at high temperatures in the case of high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition , as reported by kumar et al .",
    "@xcite , formation of silver oxide in the laser plume during pulsed laser evaporation of ag and ag - doped yba@xmath15cu@xmath2o@xmath47 superconductor and la@xmath48mno@xmath49 manganite targets leads to the incorporation of oxygen into the lattice by decomposition of the silver oxide at the surface of substrate .",
    "this process leads to the improvement of the physical properties of the films .",
    "+ from the above explanations it is clear that the nominal pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites can be conveniently described by [ ag + self doped pr@xmath50mno@xmath31 ] , where vacancy content @xmath52 will remain almost constant for the higher doping contents .",
    "the variation of unit cell volume and distortion parameter with doping content ( fig .",
    "2 ) is consistent with the proposed model .",
    "according to boujelben et al .",
    "@xcite , the average radius of the vacancies at the pr@xmath5 site is larger than the radius of pr@xmath5 . as discussed above , sample @xmath10=0.05 contains vacancies , thus its cell volume is larger than that of undoped sample .",
    "sample pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 has larger cell volume than the sample @xmath10=0.05 because of its higher vacancy content . with further increasing of ag content , the oxygen content of the samples increases and lead to the increase of mn@xmath32 ions .",
    "as can be understood from fig .",
    "3 , the content of mn@xmath32 significantly increased in @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the decrease of cell volume with @xmath10 for @xmath54 can be explained by the increase of the content of mn@xmath32 ( @xmath55=0.530  , @xmath56=0.645  ) .",
    "for @xmath10=0.25 , the cell volume slightly increased .",
    "the @xmath57 of this sample is also decreased .",
    "it seems that there is a correlation between cell volume and @xmath57 ( table i ) .",
    "the increase of lattice parameter @xmath27 and the decrease of lattice parameter @xmath28 for samples @xmath10=0.05 and pr@xmath12mno@xmath2 , means the increase of distortion in these samples . in the other side , as observable in fig .",
    "2 , the increase of mn@xmath32 for the higher doping contents leads to the reduction of the distortion parameter .",
    "the distortion parameter is almost the same for @xmath58 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the distortion parameter of an undistorted structure is 1 .",
    "our results are consistent with the results of mantytskaya et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported that an antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition occurs by increasing oxygen concentration in pr@xmath12mno@xmath1 system .",
    "+ temperature dependence of resistivity for all the pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites exhibit semiconducting behavior over the whole measured temperature range , which is similar to the nd@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 system @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the temperature dependence of resistivity for sample @xmath10=0.20 in the temperature range of 95 - 270 k. as fig .",
    "6 shows , the resistivity curve is divided into two parts by a characteristic temperature , @xmath59 125 k. such anomaly of resistivity in the vicinity of @xmath7 is associated with the onset of ferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , no metal - insulator transition was observed in the samples at around @xmath7 , which indicate that the nominal pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 manganites are ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the structural , magnetic and electrical properties of nominal pr@xmath0ag@xmath1mno@xmath2 compounds were investigated .",
    "we proposed that the enhancement of @xmath57 is not due to the substitution of the ag@xmath40 for the pr@xmath5 and most likely originated from the oxygenation of the manganite structure by the oxygen released from the metallic silver at high temperatures .",
