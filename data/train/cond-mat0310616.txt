    "nonlinear relaxation decay of physical systems from an initial unstable or metastable state involves fundamental aspects of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the investigation of nonlinear dynamics and instabilities in systems away from equilibrium in fact has led to some counterintuitive and resonance - like phenomena . among these",
    "we cite the stochastic resonance @xcite , the resonant activation @xcite , the noise enhanced stability ( nes ) @xcite and noise induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "recent theoeretical investigations have shown that the average escape time from metastable states in fluctuating potentials has a nonmonotonic behaviour as a function of the noise intensity @xcite .",
    "this resonance - like behaviour , which contradicts the monotonic behaviour predicted by the kramers theory @xcite , is the nes phenomenon : the stability of metastable or unstable states can be enhanced by the noise and the average life time of the metastable state is greater than the deterministic decay time .",
    "the inclusion of realistic noise sources with a finite correlation time in modelling dynamical systems can impact both the stationary and the dynamic features of nonlinear systems .",
    "for metastable thermal equilibrium systems it has been demonstrated that colored thermal noise can substantially modify the diffusive barrier transmission @xcite . for bistable systems the colored noise driven",
    "escape rate for small and large correlation time has been derived in ref .",
    "a rich and enormous literature on escape processes driven by colored noise was produced in the 80 s .",
    "as an example of this literature concerning colored noise we cite the escape from metastable states @xcite , the mfpt from a marginal state @xcite and the decay of an unstable state @xcite . in this work we present a study of the average decay time of an overdamped brownian particle subject to a cubic potential with a metastable state .",
    "we focus on the role of different unstable initial conditions and of colored noise in the average escape time .",
    "the effect of _ color _ on the transient dynamics of the escape process is strictly related to the characteristic time scale of the system , i. e. the relaxation time inside the metastable state @xmath2 . for correlation time values",
    "less than the relaxation time ( @xmath3 ) , the system `` sees ''",
    "the noise source as white noise and the dynamical regime of the brownian particle is like the white noise dynamics with a shift of all curves calculated at different initial positions towards higher values of noise intensity . for strong color , i. e. for values of correlation time larger than the relaxation time ( @xmath4 )",
    "nontrivial results are obtained .",
    "particularly we obtain : ( i ) a big shift of the behaviours of the average escape times towards higher noise intensities ; ( ii ) an enhancement of the value of the average escape time maximum and a broadening of the nes region in the plane ( @xmath5 ) , which becomes very large for high values of @xmath0 ; ( iii ) the absence of the peculiar initial position @xmath1 , found in a previous study @xcite , which separates the set of the initial unstable states producing divergency from those which give only a nonmonotonic behavior of the average escape time .",
    "this is the relevant result of this paper .",
    "for all the initial unstable states we find an enhancement of the average escape time with respect to the deterministic decay time and in the strong correlated noise regime ( @xmath6 ) a nonmonotonic behavior of the the average escape time .",
    "the starting point of our study is the langevin equation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite",
    "@xmath9    where @xmath10 is the wigner process giving a gaussian noise with the usual statistical properties : @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the integration of eq.([eqou ] )",
    "yields    @xmath13    which for @xmath14 and for @xmath15 gives    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the correlation time of the process .",
    "the system of stochastic differential equations ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ eqou ] ) , which represent a two - dimensional markovian process , is equivalent to a non - markovian langevin equation driven with additive gaussian correlated noise with @xmath8 obeying the properties ( [ meanou ] ) and ( [ corou ] ) .",
    "it is possible to show that the eq.([eqou ] ) for the ou process gives the correct limit @xmath19 , i. e. the white noise term .",
    "in fact    @xmath20    where we use the property of @xmath21 function    @xmath22    and the factor @xmath23 disappears because of the integration range .",
    "the stationary correlation function of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( [ corou ] ) gives in the limit @xmath24 the correlation function of the white noise    @xmath25    the potential @xmath26 used in eq.([eq ] ) is a cubic one    @xmath27    with @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the potential profile has a local stable state at @xmath30 and an unstable state at @xmath31 ( see fig.[fpot ] ) .",
    "the relaxation time for the metastable state at @xmath30 is    @xmath32_{x=0 } = 2 a ,    \\label{u1}\\ ] ]    which is the characteristic time scale of our system .",
    "the various initial positions investigated ( dots ) ; @xmath1 is the critical initial position found in the case of white noise , which remains only for weak colored noise ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the absorbing boundary is @xmath33.,height=264 ]",
    "the calculations of the average escape time as a function of the colored noise intensity have been performed by averaging over @xmath34 realizations the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the absorbing boundary for the escape process is put on @xmath33 .",
    "for all the initial unstable states ( see fig.[fpot ] ) and all the correlation times evaluated we find an enhancement of the average escape time with respect to the deterministic time as a function of the noise intensity .",
    "we can observe the characteristic behavior of the nes effect for unstable states with white noise in fig.[fnes]a @xcite where we also find the comparison with the calculation performed with colored noise with @xmath35 ( fig.[fnes]b ) .",
    "the behaviours of the average escape time as a function of colored noise intensity with the others values of @xmath0 are shown in fig.[tau ] .    ) , namely : @xmath36 , with steps of @xmath37 @xcite ; b ) mfpt for @xmath38 and the same initial positions.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ] -0.2 cm    we clearly observe two dynamical regimes : ( a ) weak colored noise ( @xmath39 ) and ( b ) strong colored noise ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "starting our observation from fig.[tau ] we see that the qualitative behavior of mfpt with white noise is recovered with @xmath41 , until @xmath42 .",
    "that is an enhancement of the average escape time with respect to the deterministic decay time with a divergent behaviour for @xmath43 and a non monotonic behavior for @xmath44 .",
    "increasing the value of the correlation time fig.[tau ] ( @xmath45 ) we observe a shift of the maximum towards higher values of the noise intensity and an enhancement of the value of the average escape maximum .",
    "moreover we observe a broadening of the nes region , which becomes very large ( up to twelve order of magnitude ) for high values of the correlation time @xmath0 ( see fig.3 with @xmath46 ) .",
    "the unexpected result is that increasing the correlation time the divergent behaviour tends to disappear , as shown in fig.[tau ] for @xmath47 and initial position @xmath48 , and disappear for all the initial positions investigated for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    ) and for four values of the correlation times @xmath0 . in the @xmath51-axes we report",
    "only the order of magnitude in powers of ten.,title=\"fig:\",height=491 ] -0.2 cm    for high values of the noise intensity all the graphs show a monotonic decrease behavior as a function of noise intensity collapsing in a unique curve , according to the behavior predicted by the kramers theory @xcite .",
    "moreover the slope of this limit curve becomes flatter increasing the correlation time .",
    "this means that the nes effect involves more and more orders of magnitude of the noise intensity .",
    "the effect of the colored noise is therefore to delay the escape process or in other words to enhance more and more the stability of the metastable state .",
    "in this work we analyzed the effect of the colored noise , generated by an ou process , on the enhancement of the average escape time in a cubic potential with a metatstable state . we analyze different initial unstable states with @xmath52 , where @xmath1 is the crossover between the divergent behaviour and the nonmonotonic behaviour of the average escape time @xcite .",
    "we obtain nes effect for all the initial positions investigated and an enhancement of the nes effect for increasing values of correlation times .",
    "the results obtained for a particle moving in a cubic potential are quite general , because we always obtain nes effect when a particle is initially located just to the right of a local potential maximum , with a local minimum or metastable state in its left side and the global escape region in its right side .    from a comparison with analogue calculation with white noise ,",
    "we observe the following similarity and differences for increasing values of the correlation times : 1 ) the peculiar point @xmath1 found for white noise separating divergent behaviours from non - monotonic behaviour , is present only in the weak colored regime @xmath3 ; 2 ) all the divergencies present in the case of white noise for all the unstable initial position in the range @xmath43 tend to transform in pure nes effect , i. e. without divergencies , for increasing values of @xmath0 ; 3 ) the region in the plane @xmath53 of the nes effect increases up to @xmath54 order of magnitude for increasing values of @xmath0 ( strong colored noise regime ) .",
    "nonmonotonic behavior of the mean escape time as a function of noise intensity therefore is a noise - induced effect for nonlinear nonequilibrium systems with metastable states which is enhanced when we consider realistic noise sources with finite correlation time .    in experiments real noise sources",
    "are correlated with a finite correlation time . as a consequence",
    "the nes effect can be observed at higher noise intensities with respect to the idealized white noise case .",
    "therefore the theoretical results obtained using white noise source are only a good approximation for low values of the correlation time .",
    "the enhancement and the shift of the nes region towards higher values of the noise intensity allow to reveal experimentally the nes effect using a suitable correlation time @xmath0 .",
