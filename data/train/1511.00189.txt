    "a stack is a sorting device that works by a sequence of push and pop operations .",
    "this last - in , first - out machine was shown by knuth  @xcite to sort a permutation if and only if that permutation avoids the pattern @xmath8 .",
    "that is , if there are not three indices @xmath9 with @xmath10 , then it is possible to run @xmath11 through a stack and output the identity permutation .",
    "the class of stack - sortable permutations is enumerated by the catalan numbers .    in the language of permutation patterns ,",
    "any downset of permutations in the permutation containment ordering is a _ class _ , and every class has a _ basis _ , which consists of the minimal permutations not in the class .",
    "given that the basis for the class of permutations sortable by one stack contains only a single pattern of length three , considering two stacks in series is quite natural .",
    "however , the problem becomes rather unwieldy . in the case of two stacks in series ,",
    "murphy  @xcite showed that class of sortable permutations has an infinite basis .",
    "the enumeration of this class also appears to be difficult .",
    "the best known bounds are given by albert , atkinson , and linton  @xcite .",
    "we note that to sort a permutation by two stacks in series , the push and pop operations are such that when an entry is popped out of the first stack , it is immediately pushed into the second stack .    to get a better handle on this problem ,",
    "many have considered different types of weaker sorting machines .",
    "one such weaker machine is a stack in which the entries must increase when read from top to bottom .",
    "atkinson , murphy , and rukuc  @xcite found an optimal algorithm for sorting permutations which are sortable using two increasing stacks in series .",
    "their left - greedy algorithm sorts all permutations sortable by this machine .",
    "( note that to obtain the identity permutation , the last stack will be an increasing stack even without declaring this restriction . )",
    "interestingly enough , the basis for these sortable permutations is still infinite , but the permutation class was found to be in bijection with the permutations that avoid @xmath12 as enumerated by bna  @xcite .",
    "both enumerations were found by using a bijection with @xmath13 trees .",
    "one can analogously define a _ decreasing stack _ as a stack in which the entries must decrease when read from top to bottom .",
    "smith  @xcite considered sorting with a decreasing stack followed by an increasing stack , a machine called di ( we refer to the decreasing stack as d and the increasing stack as i ) .",
    "we illustrate how a permutation can be sorted with the di sorting machine in figure  [ di_example ] .",
    "notice that this permutation contains the pattern @xmath14 , and as such can not be sorted by two increasing stacks in series .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we begin by producing @xmath15 by appending a diagonal ( figure [ fig : graph_inverse](a ) ) .",
    "we identify @xmath16 and @xmath17 based on the relative locations of the diagonal edges with respect to the north edges .",
    "we construct @xmath18 by converting each diagonal edge to a north edge ( figure [ fig : graph_inverse](b ) ) .",
    "next we find @xmath19 and construct @xmath20 by inserting ` e ` before the ` n ` at each of the locations in @xmath21 specified by @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath23 , and with this we construct @xmath24 .",
    "observe that @xmath25 is the adi word of 81736245 .",
    "while the bijection obtained from algorithm  [ adi_word_to_path ] can be used to show exactly which schrder path corresponds to a given di - sortable permutation , there are several properties that translate prominently between permutation and path .",
    "[ number_rtlm ] if @xmath25 is the adi word of a di - sortable permutation @xmath11 , then @xmath28 if and only if @xmath29 is a right - to - left minimum .",
    "furthermore , the number of right - to - left minima of a di - sortable permutation @xmath11 is one more than the number of diagonal steps in its corresponding schrder path .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a right - to - left minimum of @xmath11 with adi word @xmath25 .",
    "there must be some @xmath30 $ ] that satisfies @xmath31 by theorem  [ en_before_c ] .",
    "assume by way of contradiction that @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which is a contradiction to @xmath29 being a right - to - left minimum .",
    "so @xmath28 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath28 for some @xmath37 $ ] and let @xmath38 $ ] such that @xmath39",
    ". then @xmath40 .",
    "therefore @xmath41 , so @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath43 .",
    "so @xmath29 is a right - to - left minimum .",
    "hence there is a one - to - one correspondence between consecutive sequences ` enc ` in @xmath25 and right - to - left minima in @xmath11 . and as seen in algorithm [ adi_word_to_path ] , these sequences give rise to one fewer diagonal in the corresponding schrder path of @xmath11 .      [ catalan ] the di - sortable permutations with one right - to - left minimum , that is the di - sortable permutations that end in @xmath44 , are enumerated by the catalan numbers . in particular , the number of di - sortable permutations of length @xmath45 ending in @xmath44 is @xmath46 .",
    "alternatively , recall that the basis for our di - sortable permutations is @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the di - sortable permutations of length @xmath45 ending in @xmath44 are exactly the permutations whose first @xmath0 entries must avoid @xmath49 , which are known to be enumerated by catalan numbers , @xmath50  @xcite .    for a given diagonal in a schrder path @xmath51 and prefix @xmath52 of @xmath51 terminating after the given diagonal ,",
    "the we say the _ height _ of the diagonal is @xmath53 .",
    "in other words , its height is the @xmath54-coordinate of the point in the path where the diagonal terminates .",
    "[ diagonal_height ] the heights of the diagonals determine the values of the right - to - left minima . in particular , if the heights of the diagonals in the schrder path corresponding to the permutation @xmath11 are @xmath58 , the right - to - left minima of @xmath11 are @xmath59 .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 has @xmath60 diagonals ( and hence @xmath11 has @xmath61 right - to - left minima ) , and let @xmath25 be the adi word of @xmath11 .",
    "notice since @xmath62 counts the ` c`s in the first @xmath63 maximal substrings of ` c`s , we have @xmath62 counts @xmath64 . as such ,",
    "the right - to - left minimum are exactly @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "( recall @xmath67 by convention . )",
    "thus @xmath68 if and only if @xmath69 for some @xmath63 where @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath70 be locations in @xmath51 so that @xmath71 is the location of the @xmath72 ` d ` ; that is @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from step 3 in algorithm  [ adi_word_to_path",
    "] , we observe that the height of the @xmath72 diagonal is @xmath75 for each @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "so the heights of the diagonals of @xmath51 are one less than the right - to - left minima of @xmath11 ( excluding 1 ) .",
    "a permutation @xmath11 is said to be _ plus - decomposable _ if @xmath11 is the concatenation of two non - empty intervals @xmath79 and @xmath80 where the values of @xmath79 are less than those of @xmath80 .",
    "further , if we rescale the entries of @xmath80 by subtracting the length of @xmath79 from each entry of @xmath80 to get a permutation @xmath81 , we denote @xmath82 .",
    "if a permutation is not plus - decomposable , we say the permutation is _ plus - indecomposable_.      the schrder path corresponding to a plus - decomposable di - sortable permutation @xmath82 is the schrder path for @xmath79 followed by a diagonal step ( on the main diagonal ) followed by the schrder path for @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , this means the schrder paths with diagonal steps on the main diagonal correspond exactly to the plus - decomposable di - sortable permutations .",
    "consider the plus - decomposable permutation @xmath82 . by corollary  [ greedy",
    "] , we know algorithm  [ sorting_algorithm ] will force the exit of all the entries of @xmath79 before any entry of @xmath80 enters the stacks .",
    "thus the adi word for @xmath11 will be the adi word for @xmath79 followed by the adi word for @xmath81 .",
    "when algorithm  [ adi_word_to_path ] acts on the adi word for @xmath11 , it will convert the first portion of the adi word to the schrder path for @xmath79 , but followed by @xmath85 as this @xmath85 is no longer the last @xmath85 of the word . at the same time",
    ", it converts the remaining portion of the adi word to the schrder path for @xmath81 .",
    "[ ex : plusdecomp ] in figure  [ fig : plusdecomp ] , we see that this schrder path for @xmath86 is the concatenation of the schrder paths for @xmath87 , @xmath8 , and @xmath44 ( a degenerate path ) , connected by diagonal edges .",
    "aguiar and moreira  @xcite showed that the number of schrder paths from @xmath2 to @xmath47 that do not have diagonal steps on the main diagonal equals the number of schrder paths from @xmath2 to @xmath47 that do have diagonal steps on the main diagonal as a particular case of a larger result .",
    "that is , they showed the number of schrder paths that do not have diagonal steps on the main diagonal are enumerated by the small schrder numbers , which gives us the following corollary .        1",
