    "in 83 , m. gromov proved that the least length ( _ systole _ , denoted `` sys '' ) of a non - contractible loop in a closed riemannian manifold  @xmath3 is bounded above in terms of the volume of  @xmath3 , if  @xmath3 satisfies the topological hypothesis of being _ essential _ ( for instance , if  @xmath3 is aspherical ) .    a key technique in gromov s seminal text @xcite is the kuratowski imbedding .",
    "namely , gromov imbeds a riemannian manifold  @xmath3 into the space @xmath4 of bounded borel functions on  @xmath3 . here",
    "a point  @xmath5 is sent to the function  @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 where `` @xmath8 '' is the riemannian distance function in  @xmath3 .",
    "this imbedding is strongly isometric , in the sense that the intrinsic distance in  @xmath3 coincides with the ambient distance in  @xmath0 defined by the sup - norm .",
    "the fact that the space  @xmath9 is infinite - dimensional may have given some readers of @xcite the impression that infinite - dimensionality of the imbedding is an essential aspect of gromov s proof of the systolic inequality for essential manifolds .",
    "in fact , this is not the case .",
    "indeed , we can choose a maximal  @xmath10-separated net  @xmath11 with  @xmath12 points ( by compactness of  @xmath3 , every infinite set would have an accumulation point , contradicting @xmath10-separation ) .",
    "choose  @xmath10 satisfying  @xmath13 . consider the reulting imbedding @xmath14 by the distance functions from points of  @xmath15 .",
    "then , for the metric inherited from the imbedding , the systole goes down by a factor at most  @xmath16 , see @xcite .",
    "thus the systolic problem can easily be reduced to finite - dimensional imbeddings .    in the present text ,",
    "we show that , similarly , by choosing a sufficiently fine  @xmath10-net , one can force the map to be  @xmath1bi - lipschitz onto its image , for all  @xmath2 ( see theorem  [ nsa ] below ) :    [ 11 ] let  @xmath3 be a compact riemannian manifold without boundary . for every @xmath2",
    ", there exists a  @xmath1bi - lipschitz finite - dimensional imbedding of  @xmath3 , approximating its isometric imbedding in  @xmath17 .    here",
    "a homeomorphism  @xmath18 is called  @xmath19bi - lipschitz if @xmath20 for all  @xmath21 , and similarly for the inverse  @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that finite - dimensional approximations work well for the filling radius inequality , as well , namely the inequality relating the filling radius of  @xmath3 and the volume of  @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the bi - lipschitz property was discussed in @xcite , where a `` sketch '' of a proof concludes as follows : `` finally , we can generalize the trigonometry argument to almost flat manifolds using the toponogov comparison theorem '' .",
    "in fact , we will see that both `` almost flatness '' and `` toponogov s theorem '' miss the mark somewhat , as the relevant ingredient in the proof is the first variation formula , which can be applied in the absence of curvature hypotheses , and does not require the difficult ( albeit classical ) result of toponogov .",
    "( similarly , even in the flat case , the argument sketched in @xcite may contain a gap in the case when , in the notation of @xcite , the pair  @xmath21 are much closer than the scale of the  @xmath23-net , as even a quadratic estimate on  @xmath24 may still be greater than  @xmath25 . )",
    "our method of proof involves the following technique .",
    "we use the _ tranfer principle _ of non - standard analysis ( see section  [ ten ] , item [ 101 ] ) to conclude that the first variation formula must apply also to the non - standard line through a pair of infinitely close hyperreal points .",
    "the main idea is to view the first variatiom formula from differential geometry , as a statement in first - order logic .",
    "note that such concepts as the injectivity radius and the first variation formula can be formulated in first order logic .",
    "this is essential for our argument , since the transfer principle allows one to conclude that real statements are true over  @xmath26 just as they are true over  @xmath27 , only if such statements are in first - order logic , i.e.  quantification over elements is allowed , quantification over sets or sequences is not allowed .",

    "we define a function @xmath99 on the product  @xmath100 as follows .",
