    "narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies are the subclass of active galaxies which show extremely small optical line widths , e.g. fwhm h@xmath1  km  s@xmath2 , as well as very high luminosity and strong variability in the x - ray band .",
    "one possible explanation of this effect is that this subclass of galaxies is characterized by a very high rate of accretion onto a central black hole of moderate mass ( e.g. pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) . in this case , the strong disc emission enhances the soft excess in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "in addition , the power - law continuum in the hard x - ray band should be steeper than in other seyfert galaxies , as strong soft flux may effectively cool the hot disc corona .",
    "the resulting primary spectrum should therefore resemble that of galactic black hole systems in the soft state .",
    "moreover , if the accretion rate is high , reflection of x - rays from the ionized disc surface is expected .",
    "this should be accompanied with the fluorescent iron  k@xmath0 line of energy 6.46.9  kev , depending on the ionization state of the reprocessor .",
    "the shape of the iron  k@xmath0 line profile depends on kinematic and relativistic effects present in the inner regions of the accretion disc .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the galaxy ton  s180 ( see turner et  al .",
    "1998 ) was modelled in several steps .",
    "firstly , we fitted a simple power - law spectrum of photon spectral index @xmath3 , with galactic absorption fixed to @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "the fit was clearly not satisfactory and the residuals show a strong spectral feature below 2 kev .",
    "we modelled the soft x - ray feature as a multitemperature disc spectrum by adding a `` disk blackbody '' model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) . however , this model for the soft continuum may not be the best one in this case as the spectrum shows a few distinct features due to intrinsic emission and absorption in the source . therefore , we modelled the soft component with the optically thick comptonization of soft photons ( `` comptt '' model in xspec ) , and we included an additional absorption edge of energy @xmath6  kev .",
    "next we included in the model the reflected continuum and the iron  k@xmath0 line ( .",
    "zycki , done & smith 1997 ) .",
    "the reprocessed spectrum is parametrized by the ionization parameter @xmath7 ( done et  al .",
    "1992 ) and the reflection amplitude @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the solid angle subtended by the reprocessor as viewed from the x - ray source .",
    "we find that the reprocessed spectrum originates in a mildly ionized ( @xmath10 ) medium , which together with the assumed temperature fixed to @xmath11  k implies the iron line energy to be 6.7  kev .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the spectrum of ton  s180 clearly shows the presence of a relativistically broadened iron emission line . neglecting the effect of line broadening worsens the fit by @xmath12 .",
    "the rest - frame line energy as well as the ionization parameter of the reflected spectral component indicate the presence of mildly ionized medium . we conclude that the k@xmath0 line is produced in the ionized , upper layer of the accretion disc around the black hole and together with the reflected continuum resulting from the irradiation of the plasma by hard x - rays .",
    "the reflection amplitude favors an isotropically illuminated disc , so that the hard x - ray emission may come from a flat corona .",
    "the disc inclination angle giving the best fit to the reflected continuum shape is in the range 3050@xmath13 .",
    "this result makes the case against the explanation of observed differences between nls1s and other seyfert  1 galaxies by specific orientation to the line of sight .",
    "the soft x - ray excess can be successfully modelled with comptonized black body emission and may originate in a transitionary , two - phase layer between the cold accretion disc and hot corona ( e.g. roaska et al . 1999 ) .",
    "assuming that the soft spectral component extends down to 0.01  kev , we obtain an absorption corrected soft luminosity of @xmath14  erg  s@xmath2 , while the hard luminosity is @xmath15  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore we obtain a soft - to - hard luminosity ratio of @xmath16 .",
    "a similar method applied to ark  564 gives a soft - to - hard luminosity ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be explained if the system accretes with near eddington luminosity , similarly to galactic black hole binaries in their soft states .",
