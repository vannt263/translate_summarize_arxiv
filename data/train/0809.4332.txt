    "@xmath3 close to @xmath4 , the solution space of a typical large random @xmath1-sat formula ( @xmath6 ) can be grouped into many clusters .",
    "the solution clusters are not homogeneous in size , some clusters may contain many more solutions than others",
    ". therefore the solution clusters are characterized by a ( continuous or discontinuous ) spectrum of entropy densities @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear whether different solution clusters are separated by high energy barriers or they can be reached one from the other through paths of low - energy intermediate partial solutions .",
    "this is one of the major open questions concerning the organization of the solution space of a random @xmath1-sat formulae . in this connection",
    ", it was recently realized that clustering of the solution space in the random @xmath1-sat problem does not pose real difficulty for heuristic local search algorithms @xcite .",
    "algorithms such as gsat , walksat and chainsat @xcite appear to be capable of efficiently escaping from valleys in the energy landscape of a random @xmath1-sat formula .",
    "these experimental experiences led to the conjecture that what really makes finding a satisfying solution hard is the presence of frozen variables ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and more recent papers @xcite ) .",
    "a frozen variable in a solution cluster is a variable which is the same literal in all the solutions of the cluster .",
    "if a finite fraction of variables are frozen in a given solution cluster , it was argued that it would be difficult for a local algorithm to assign values to all these variables , and that such solutions would be hard to find @xcite .",
    "the freezing transition for the random @xmath1-sat problem in principle can be estimated by the entropic cavity method of statistical mechanics @xcite but extensive mean - field population dynamics simulations @xcite are needed .",

    "this study has been driven by two main motivations : first we wish to know in more detail the @xmath7local structures of the solution space of the random @xmath0-sat problem , which might be invisible in ensemble studies ; and second we wish to know whether the solutions obtained by the survey - propagation and the walksat algorithms for a given random @xmath0-sat formula are contained in the dominating solution clusters of this formula . given an initial satisfying solution for a @xmath0-sat formula , we use the whitening algorithm of parisi @xcite ( see also refs .",

    "we point out that , even if a reference solution is completely whitable by the whitening algorithm , some variables in the associated solution cluster may still be frozen .",
    "this is because variable freezing can be caused by another independent mechanism , namely long - range frustration among unfrozen variables as discussed in refs .",

    "besides the ensemble of completely random @xmath0-sat formulas , a set of large random @xmath0-sat formulas containing a pre - specified satisfying solution are also studied , and for each of them several additional solutions are obtained by the sp algorithm and the walksat algorithm . for a @xmath0-sat formula in this second ensemble , if the entropic bp iterative equations are run with the planted solution as the initial condition , a fixed point is quickly reached , but if a solution obtained by the sp or the walksat algorithm is used as the initial condition , the iterative equations again fails to converge .",
    "this observation suggests that planted solutions and solutions obtained by the sp algorithm are quite different . in cases when the bp algorithm fail to reach a fixed point , we fix the spin values of a tiny fraction of variables and then re - run the bp iteration equations",

    "it then follows that , in a solution cluster of a @xmath1-sat problem , if one of the solutions can be completely whitened , then all the other solutions are also completely whitable . to prove this ,",
    "let us suppose the contrary could be true , i.e. , there exist two solutions of the same cluster , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath55 being completely whitable and @xmath56 containing a nonempty set @xmath65 of nonwhite variables .",
    "one can change @xmath56 into @xmath55 by following a path of single - spin flips , and at at each hopping the flipped variable is whitened . during this transition process",

    "the spinflip program can also be used to explore the fine structure of a solution cluster ( paper in preparation ) .",

    "this flipping process at each branch stops after a variable which in its original spin value satisfies all its neighboring clauses has been flipped .",
    "after the whole iteration process stops , if no clause is violated then the proposed spin flip of variable @xmath8 is accepted and all the flipped variables during this process are added to the set of unfrozen variables . as a comparison of this program ( method @xmath120 ) to the spinflip program ( method @xmath114 ) ,",
