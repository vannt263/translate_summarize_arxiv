    "with the launch of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) in 2003 , the cmb has been measured in highly detailed full - sky maps @xcite , which have been examined in great detail over the past few years @xcite .",
    "in particular , the angular two - point correlation function @xmath1 has been studied ; it is defined as the average product between the temperature of two points angle @xmath0 apart @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the fluctuation around the mean of the temperature in direction @xmath4 on the sky .",
    "several anomalies have been claimed in the angular correlation function , especially the missing power on large angular scales ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the angular correlation function is very nearly zero at scales above @xmath5 ; such a low correlation has a significance of @xmath6 in the standard gaussian random , statistically isotropic cosmology .",
    "this result , first observed in cobe data , has been strengthened with wmap first - year data @xcite , as well as later wmap observations @xcite , though questions have been raised regarding its significance @xcite    in this brief report , we explore the directional contributions to the angular two - point correlation function .",
    "directional information is lost in the original definition of @xmath1 , as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctheta ] ) assumes statistical isotropy and averages over all directions on the sky .",
    "our goal is to provide a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctheta ] ) , and ascertain if there are specific directions which result in the unusually low correlation .",
    "and @xmath7 is shown .",
    "the first black curve ( labeled total @xmath7 ) indicates the median relationship in random gaussian skies .",
    "the blue and purple bands surrounding it are ( respectively ) 68@xmath8 and 95@xmath8 contours , indicating the spread of the distribution due to cosmic variance .",
    "( note that the contours shown are only approximate for very high or low @xmath7 values , due to very low statistics . )",
    "the second black curve ( labeled ) logarithmically plots the relative fraction of random maps ; the green and red asterisks indicate the values for @xmath9 and @xmath7 from the fiducial cut - sky and full - sky ilc map , respectively .",
    "the narrow contours indicate a very tight relation between the two statistics .",
    "the cut sky ( green ) fits the typical relation , but has an unusually low value for @xmath10 ; hence , it is possible that @xmath7 is low because @xmath10 is .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "the angular two - point correlation function is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctheta ] ) , where the average is taken over all pairs of points separated by angle @xmath0 on the sky .",
    "we now propose a new statistical quantity , a fixed - vertex correlation function @xmath11 where @xmath4 is a direction in the sky , and the average is taken over a ring of pixels separated by @xmath0 from the direction @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , notice that @xmath12 is no longer the simple average of @xmath13 .",
    "we need to introduce the weight function @xmath14 , the fraction of unmasked points in the ring @xmath0 degrees away from @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath16 ] .",
    "maps of @xmath13 for @xmath0 = @xmath17 and @xmath0 = @xmath18 are shown in figure 1 .    in order to quantify the low power in the angular two - point function between approximately @xmath5 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the statistic @xcite @xmath20 has been widely used . in order to examine possible _ anisotropies _ in @xmath1 , we attempt to separate @xmath7 into contributions from specific directions @xmath15 ; we define @xmath21 so that the sum of @xmath22 over all pixels is @xmath7 . as the fraction of the ring for the respective @xmath23 that is unmasked ( w is 0 if @xmath24 is a masked point )",
    "we have @xmath25 ]    note that the quantity @xmath26 is non - local , in that it receives contributions from not only the direction @xmath4 , but from the whole sky , due to the term @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s12omega_def ] ) .",
    "so , for example , excluding a pixel @xmath15 will _ not _ change the value of @xmath7 simply by @xmath27 , because there is also an indirect effect of the changed global @xmath1 as well as the changed monopole that is being subtracted .",
    "these two are approximately constant if only a small area of the sky is affected , so analysis of @xmath26 is suitable for examination of the effect of small regions of the sky on @xmath7 .",
    "however , these indirect effects must be taken into consideration while examining much larger regions .",
    "we first examine plots of @xmath7 in random maps to obtain an idea of what to expect .",
    "we generate 80,000 synthetic gaussian random statistically isotropic maps , based on the underlying best - fit @xmath28cdm cosmological model .",
    "@xcite    a strong relationship between contributions to power in @xmath7 and the regions of the quadrupole and octupole ( qo regions for simplicity ) is consistently seen in random maps .",
    "an example may be seen in the right panels of figures [ fig : s12omega ] and [ fig : qoregions ] with the full - sky ilc map .    in order to quantify these contributions",
    ", we repeat our analysis of @xmath26 in the regions of the sky containing only the quadrupole and octupole .",
    "we now compute @xmath26 in a sky containing only the quadrupole and octupole of each map , and define the qo region to correspond to pixels @xmath29 where @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is selected so that @xmath32 .",
    "we define the qo region of each individual synthetic map separately .",
    "the contribution of @xmath7 from the qo region is thus defined as @xmath33    there is an extremely strong , almost linear relationship between @xmath10 and total @xmath7 , plotted in fig [ fig : sqo ] .",
    "in contrast , the total @xmath7 and the contributions from non - qo regions of the sky are essentially uncorrelated , except at very high ( @xmath34 @xmath35 ) values of @xmath7 , with which we are not concerned .",
    "note that by definition , @xmath36 .",
    "this result makes intuitive sense , as the statistic @xmath26 is based off of @xmath37 , which is higher when the central point @xmath15 is in a high - temperature region such as the qo region .",
    "more qualitatively , @xmath26 is a measure of correlation on the largest scales in the sky - which are , of course , the quadrupole and octupole .",
    "we now examine wmap s seven year maps in our analysis @xcite .",
    "we use the full sky and cut - sky ilc ( internal linear combination ) maps .",
    "the maps are first degraded to @xmath38 ( corresponding to pixel scale @xmath39 ) ; next , the kq75 mask is applied , and finally all resulting pixels that are more than 10% masked ( i.e.  with mask value of less than 0.9 ) are excluded from the analysis .",
    "finally , the dipole was removed .    from inspection of the full - sky ilc @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qoregions ] , right panel ) , there is an obvious correlation between the magnitude of @xmath26 contributions and the regions where the quadrupole and octupole have power , as expected from our analysis of random maps . quantifying this result using our previous definition of the qo region",
    ", we find that @xmath40 = 8837 @xmath35 , while @xmath41 = -349 @xmath35",
    ". can be greater than the full @xmath7 , since the contributions from each individual @xmath42 can be negative as well as positive , and their sum over the full sky is equal to the full @xmath7 . ]",
    "the values observed in the full - sky map are very typical , compared to our random map results .    moving on to the cut - sky map",
    ", there is much less power on large angular scales , as expected ; only 0.06@xmath8 of random maps have a similarly low value of @xmath7 . and as the empirical relationship predicts , @xmath10 is similarly low , at the 0.046@xmath8 level . in comparison ,",
    "the non - qo contribution , @xmath43 is quite typical ( 15.6% confidence level . )",
    "thus , the strong correlation that we observed in random maps continues to hold for the anomalous cut - sky map , as shown in figure [ fig : sqo ] .",
    "what is unlikely about our sky is simply for @xmath10 to exhibit such a low value in the first place .",
    "it is known that the quadrupole in the cmb sky is lower than expected from @xmath28cdm results , though not anomalously so.@xcite it makes sense to consider what happens to our results above if we use the @xmath28cdm theoretical power spectrum for monte carlo simulations as before , but substituting the low wmap quadrupole ( @xmath44 ) , in order to test if our result is still valid . as expected , the significance of @xmath7 relative to these new synthetic maps is now lower ( @xmath45 compared to @xmath46 before ) , and a similar effect is seen in our new statistics : @xmath10 has a significance of @xmath47 ( previously @xmath48 ) , and @xmath43 is again typical  @xmath49 c.l . , compared to @xmath50 before .",
    "therefore , comparison to gaussian random skies conditioned to have low @xmath51 gives results that are somewhat less significant then before , which is expected since we already knew that part of the low-@xmath7 problem originated from low quadrupole .",
    "however , the strong correlation observed in random maps continues to hold .",
    "in addition , the various statistics are still low with @xmath52 probability , even compared to skies with the low quadrupole , and the lowness is once again due to lack of power from the quadrupole and octupole regions .",
    "in this paper , we first introduced the fixed - vertex correlation function @xmath53 , which has the potential to be a useful tool for studying the statistical isotropy of the correlation function .",
    "we then observe that the value of @xmath7 in random skies is correlated with an expected anisotropy in the quadrupole and octupole regions of the sky .",
    "our sky , known to have a low @xmath7 , also receives low contributions from its quadrupole and octupole regions .",
    "we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem here , as we can not tell if the low @xmath10 caused a low @xmath7 , or vice versa , or if both were caused by an underlying factor .",
    "it is worth considering that this result and the one of @xcite may stem from the same root cause .",
    "it is also interesting that random monte carlo skies ( which are generated from the assumption of statistical isotropy ) and the reconstructed full - sky ilc ( which assumes statistical isotropy in the reconstruction process ) have similar values of @xmath7 and @xmath10 , while the cut - sky temperature map is anomalous .",
    "these findings may provide a hint for a future understanding of the origin of large - angle missing power in the cmb .",
    "we thank dragan huterer for initial guidance in the project and many useful suggestions .",
    "we thank glenn starkman for introducing the idea of @xmath13 .",
    "we thank hiranya peiris for a useful communication .",
