    "in addition , the anti - correlation between h@xmath0o ice and the abundance of several co - ice components suggest that the time available for this co - based chemistry decreases when a longer time is spent in the h@xmath0o - ice formation stage , where o is converted into h@xmath0o and co@xmath0:h@xmath0o ice .",

    "in addition to atomic processing , the ices are continuously exposed to cosmic rays and cosmic - ray induced uv photons  @xcite have estimated the relative doses .",
    "this may both affect the simple ice abundances and result in some cold formation of more complex molecules .      though much of the observed ice evolution can be explained by processes during the prestellar stage ,",

    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , some co and ch@xmath8 can be trapped in h@xmath0o ices , however , which is important for predicting ice abundances in moderately heated regions , such as the comet forming zones in protoplanetary disks .    from experiments by e.g. @xcite",
    ", moderate ice heating to 2050  k also enables the movement of radicals within the ice .",

    "most complex ice features can not be directly observed , however , because of band confusion .",
    "instead most constraints on this ice evolutionary phase comes from millimeter observations of desorbed ice chemistry products .",
    "complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath7ch@xmath0oh and hcooch@xmath7 are observed in the inner regions around high - mass protostars , in so called hot cores , at abundances that can not be reproduced by gas phase chemistry .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that they correlate with the ice chemistry product ch@xmath7oh .",
    "these observational pieces of evidence , together with the existence of a plausible ice production pathway of complex molecules , strongly support a scenario in which complex ices are produced in the outer envelope and then desorb into the gas - phase as icy grains flow in towards the protostar .",
    "iras 16293 - 2422 , observed by e.g. @xcite and @xcite is a low - mass equivalent to the high - mass hot cores , and there are at least five other low - mass protostars where complex molecules such as hcooch@xmath7 and ch@xmath7och@xmath7 are detected by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also detected complex molecules in a low - mass outflow and @xcite recently detected hcooch@xmath7 in a cold and quiescent part of a low - mass star forming region that probably has been illuminated by uv through a protostellar outflow cavity . combining these observational results ,",
    "berg et al . ( 2011b , subm .",
    "to apj ) find that hcooch@xmath7 generally dominates the complex chemistry toward outflows and low - mass protostellar envelopes , consistent with experiments on co : ch@xmath7oh ice photochemistry below 25  k. in contrast , observations of high - mass and resolved low - mass hot cores contain more ch@xmath7och@xmath7 or c@xmath0h@xmath20oh than hcooch@xmath7 .",
    "this is evidence for a sequential formation of complex molecules , starting with hco - rich molecules as long as co ice is abundant , followed by ch@xmath21-rich molecules at higher ice temperatures .",

    "is that most ices up to ch@xmath7oh in complexity have already formed by the time the protostar turns on .",
    "ice abundance variations must therefore be mainly due to variations in the prestellar ice formation processes .",
    "variations in co freeze - out and the subsequent co - based chemistry is a likely main contributor to the observed differences in ice abundances in different lines of sight , but other processes may be important as well",
    ". thermal and uv processing of ices by the protostar is important for the continued evolution of the ice , leading up to the formation of hot core molecules and the complex organics found in comets . to further constrain the ice evolution from cloud cores to comets",
    "will require a combination of high - resolution ir studies to detect complex molecules directly in the ice , millimeter observations toward protostars and disks to image desorbed ice chemistry products , and more detailed experiments and models of both the early ice formation stages and of the reactions that convert simple ices into more complex ones ."

    "<S> icy grain mantles are commonly observed through infrared spectroscopy toward dense clouds , cloud cores , protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to being a molecular reservoir , ice chemistry is responsible for much of the chemical evolution from h@xmath0o to complex , prebiotic molecules . combining the exisiting iso , spitzer , vlt and keck ice data results in a large sample of ice sources ( @xmath180 ) that span all stages of star formation and a large range of protostellar luminosities ( @xmath20.110@xmath3 l@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we summarize the different techniques that have been applied to mine this ice data set on information on typical ice compositions in different environments and what this implies about how ices form and evolve during star and planet formation . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on how to maximize the use of empirical constraints from ice observations , followed by the application of information from experiments and models . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy is used to identify ice bands and to constrain which ices form early during cloud formation , which form later in the prestellar core and which require protostellar heat and/or uv radiation to form . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of statistical tests , survival analysis and ice maps is highlighted ; the latter directly reveals that the prestellar ice formation takes place in two phases , associated with h@xmath0o and co ice formation , respectively , and that most protostellar ice variation can be explained by differences in the prestellar co ice formation stage . </S>",
    "<S> finally , special attention is paid to the difficulty of observing complex ices directly and how gas observations , experiments and models help in constraining this ice chemistry stage . </S>"
