    "quantum networks comprised of local nodes and quantum channels are of fundamental importance for quantum communication and essential for scalable and distributed quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a quantum interface mapping between local and flying qubits is the key component of the quantum network .",
    "schemes for this purpose utilizing strong coupling @xcite between a high - q optical cavity and the atoms have been suggested @xcite . however , such schemes put challenging constraints on optical cavities which is difficult to be miniaturized . a novel scheme based on surface plasmons ( sps ) to reach the strong - coupling regime on a chip",
    "has been intensively explored @xcite . a substantial increase in the coupling strength @xmath0",
    "can be achieved through using sps where the effective mode volume @xmath1 for the photons can be greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "an effective purcell factor @xmath2 in realistic systems is possible @xcite , where @xmath3 is the spontaneous emission rate into the surface plasmons and @xmath4 describes the loss rate into other channels . furthermore , unlike the strong coupling based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , this strong coupling is broadband @xcite .    on account of these considerations , we proposes a general control scheme of emitter - photon quantum interface based on the strong interaction between surface plasmons in a nanotip and an optical emitter .",

    "shaping technique @xcite , two aspects of the process are controllable : the production of an arbitrarily shaped pulse under the condition that it is sufficiently smooth and the operation of the raman process as a partial cycle , in which the initial state @xmath5 is mapped into an entangled state @xmath6 for any @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the stationary qubit states and the flying qubit is denoted by the vacuum state @xmath10 and a single plasmon ( photon ) state with wave packet @xmath11",
    ".    a number of essential functions of a quantum network can be fulfilled by this quantum interface:(1 ) it can send a flying quantum state and can also function as a deterministic source of a single photon with arbitrary pulse shape and controllable average photon number .",

    "( iii ) a state can be transferred from one node to another .",
    "( iv ) an entanglement between either two remote stationary qubits or a stationary qubit and a flying qubit can be generated in a partial raman cycle .",
    "numerical simulations of this scheme demonstrate robustness against parameters errors and high fidelity . with stronger emitter photon coupling strength , faster",
    "manipulation times can be expected .",
    "furthermore , as the setup is much easier to be made smaller , this scheme would open the possibility to higher scalability of quantum computers .",
