    "the initial - final mass relation denotes a mapping from the initial mass of a main - sequence star to its final white dwarf configuration and hence provides the total mass loss that a star has undergone through its lifetime , a fundamental property of stellar evolution @xcite . at one extreme ,",
    "a small extrapolation of the high mass end of the relation can lead to constraints on the critical mass that separates white dwarf production from type ii supernova explosions .",
    "this can therefore be used to estimate energetics involved in feedback processes through the prediction of the birth rates of type ii supernovae and neutron stars @xcite . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "the relation represents a rare tool to probe the progenitor properties of the majority of the evolved stars in old stellar populations ( most of which are now low mass white dwarfs ) .",
    "if constrained over a large mass range ( i.e. , 1  7 @xmath1 ) , the relation can be a powerful input to chemical evolution models of galaxies ( including enrichment in the interstellar medium ) and therefore enhances our understanding of star formation efficiencies in these systems @xcite .",
    "the importance of the initial - final mass relation has been recently compounded as a result of the discovery of thousands of white dwarfs in both the galactic disk and halo . for the former ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey has spectroscopically confirmed many new white dwarfs bringing the total number of such objects in our galaxy to almost 10,000 @xcite .",
    "this has led to an improved white luminosity function for the disk of our galaxy that shows an abrupt truncation at @xmath5 = 15.3 @xcite . in the galactic halo , recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations of the globular clusters m4 @xcite , omega  cen @xcite , and ngc  6397 @xcite have similarly uncovered several thousand cluster white dwarfs .",
    "modeling the luminosity functions of the disk white dwarfs and the cooling sequences of the halo star clusters , directly yields the ages of the galactic disk and halo components . in both cases ,",
    "the white dwarf samples are dominated by low mass stars and therefore such modeling requires an input initial - final mass relation that is well understood at the low mass end ( e.g. , ferrario et  al .",
    "2005 and hansen et  al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the first attempt to derive an initial - final mass relation was made by @xcite .",
    "he compared theoretical models of mass loss ( e.g. , fusi - pecci & renzini 1976 ) to the observed masses of a few white dwarfs in the nearby hyades and pleiades clusters and concluded that the observed mass loss was larger than model predictions . shortly after this pioneering work , @xcite and @xcite used photographic plates to search for new white dwarf candidates in several young open clusters , including ngc  1039 , ngc  2168 , ngc  2287 , ngc  2422 , ngc  2632 ( praesepe ) , ngc  6633 , ngc  6405 , and ic  2602 .",
    "these studies modeled the expected numbers of white dwarfs in each cluster and estimated limits on the boundaries for the upper progenitor mass limit to white dwarf production ( 5  7  @xmath1 ) .",
    "solid constraints on the relation came from subsequent spectroscopic observations of these white dwarfs as well as newly discovered degenerate stars in nearby open clusters ( koester & reimers 1981 , 1985 , 1993 , 1996 ; reimers & koester 1982 , 1989 , 1994 ; weidemann & koester 1983 ; weidemann 1987 , 1997 ; jeffries 1997 ) .",
    "the result of this enormous two - decade long effort was an initial - final mass relation consisting of @xmath020 data points , from observations of roughly a half - dozen open star clusters ( see weidemann  2000 for a review ) .",
    "the final relation shows a clear trend with higher mass main - sequence stars producing increasingly more massive white dwarfs .    in the last few years , the amount of data constraining the initial - final mass relation has more than doubled @xcite .",
    "although the general trend of the relation remains intact , the scatter has increased possibly signifying a relation between the stellar mass loss and the properties of the host environment ( e.g. , metallicity effects  kalirai et  al .",
    "2005a ) . as an extreme example",
    ", the recent study of the white dwarf population of the super - solar metallicity star cluster ngc  6791 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath60.4 ) has revealed it to be significantly undermassive relative to the field distribution .",
    "this is clear evidence that the progenitor stars of these remnants experienced enhanced mass loss in post main - sequence evolutionary stages due to the high metallicity of the cluster @xcite .",
    "prior to this study , the oldest open star clusters that have been successfully targeted for white dwarf spectroscopy to build an initial - final mass relation are the hyades and praesepe",
    ". the ages of both of these systems are 600  700  myr @xcite , indicating that the present day turn - off masses are @xmath72.75  @xmath1 .",
    "this threshold therefore represents the current low mass anchor on the initial - final mass relation as all of the white dwarfs in these clusters must have evolved from main - sequence progenitors with a mass larger than @xmath02.75  @xmath1 .",
    "a very small fraction of all stars in the universe have masses this large , and therefore the relation is often extrapolated to lower masses to provide useful input .",
    "spectroscopic white dwarf studies have been unable to target any old open clusters ( @xmath8 1  gyr ) for several reasons .",
    "primarily , few photometric studies exist that have identified populations of white dwarf candidates in these clusters .",
    "second , the known rich old open clusters are generally much further ( @xmath910@xmath10 ) than nearby clusters such as the hyades and praesepe . finally ,",
    "because of their older age , most cluster white dwarfs in these systems have cooled to very faint magnitudes thus making it difficult to obtain high quality spectra of the stars .",
    "white dwarfs in the nearest globular star clusters have also recently been targeted for mass measurements by several groups .",
    "the only successful campaign measured a mean mass of 0.53  @xmath1 for white dwarfs in ngc  6752 @xcite . given the lower s /",
    "n of these data , the temperature of the stars was measured from the spectra and then combined with photometric information to yield a mass .",
    "this mean mass is consistent with several independent arguments that all suggest the masses of white dwarfs in globular clusters should be 0.51  0.55 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > \" , ]     [ table3 ]",
    "we stressed earlier the importance of a well constrained initial - final mass relation _ over a wide mass range_. star formation in the universe leads to an initial mass function that is generally steep ( i.e. , many more low mass stars are produced as compared to high mass stars ",

    "we illustrate a simple mass function with a salpeter slope in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] ( top ) , for 1000 stars over a mass range of 0.8  7 @xmath1 .",
    "these limits have been chosen as they range from the lowest mass stars that could have formed white dwarfs over the age of the universe ( @xmath00.8  @xmath1 ) to the most massive such stars ( @xmath07  @xmath1 ) . in the bottom panel ,",
    "we illustrate the initial - final mass relation with all constraints over the past 30 years ( crosses ) .",

    ", we find that _ only _ 13% of all stars are born with masses this large over the 0.8  7 @xmath1 mass range .",
    "therefore , the present initial - final mass relation can not be directly used to infer progenitor properties for almost all white dwarfs in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the 2.75 @xmath1 lower initial mass limit on the relation results purely from an observational limitation . a low mass ( 0.6 @xmath1 )",
    ", bright white dwarf has @xmath13 11 at an age of @xmath0100 myr . at a distance of 1.5  kpc ,",
    "this translates to an observed magnitude of @xmath14 22",
    ". a more massive white dwarf at this age will be even fainter in the @xmath15 band . as discussed above , measuring a spectroscopic mass for a white dwarf",
    "requires the accurate characterization of higher order balmer lines with @xmath16 4000 @xmath17 . achieving this for a @xmath15 = 22 star obviously requires both a large telescope and a blue - sensitive spectrograph .",
    "since very few rich ( e.g. , @xmath91000  @xmath1 ) , old star clusters are located within 1.5  kpc of the sun ( m67 is the only one ) , the targeted systems have typically been poorly populated , nearby , younger systems ( such as the hyades , pleiades , and praesepe clusters ) .",
    "these clusters have ages of a few hundred myr and therefore are not old enough to have allowed the evolution of lower mass stars off the main sequence .",
    "the masses of white dwarfs in systems such as ngc  7789 and ngc  6819 present us the opportunity to extend the mass range over which the initial - final mass relation has been studied .",
    "the younger of our two clusters , ngc  7789 , has an age of 1.4  gyr .",
    "the main - sequence turnoff of this system is therefore 2.0  @xmath1 @xcite and most of the cluster white dwarfs will have evolved from stars just above this mass ( again , due to the slope of the mass function ) .",
    "the age of ngc  6819 is 2.5  gyr and therefore the present day turnoff mass is 1.6  @xmath1 .",
    "the progenitor masses for the confirmed white dwarfs in each cluster are indeed very similar to one another , and just above the turnoff masses ( see @xmath3 in table  3 ) .",
    "we can also add data from the very old cluster ngc  6791 to the initial - final mass relation . at an age of 8.5  gyr",
    ", this system represents one of the oldest open star clusters and has a main - sequence turnoff mass of @xmath01.1  @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite present evidence that a significant population of white dwarfs in this cluster resulted from progenitors that expelled enough mass on the red giant branch to avoid the helium flash , and therefore the white dwarfs have helium cores rather than carbon - oxygen cores .",
    "this is believed to be a result of the high metallicity of the system , [ fe / h ] = @xmath60.4 .",
    "the mean mass of the nine cluster white dwarfs targeted in that study is @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 = 0.43  @xmath1 .",
    "the threshold at which a helium - core white dwarf is produced at ngc  6791 s metallicity is 0.45  0.47 @xmath1 , and therefore to be conservative , we consider only the single confirmed cluster member with a mass @xmath90.50  @xmath1 ( definite carbon - oxygen core white dwarf ) .",
    "this object , ngc  6791 wd  7 , has @xmath3 = @xmath21 and @xmath4 = 0.53 @xmath22 0.02  @xmath1 ( see kalirai et  al .",
    "2007 for the spectral fits ) .",
    "the initial mass for this star has been calculated using the same @xcite models as for ngc  7789 and ngc  6819 , for @xmath23 = 0.035 ( the highest metallicity available in these models ) .",
    "we note that this data point may still represent a lower limit ( i.e. , the final mass ) since the progenitor star of the carbon - oxygen core white dwarf also likely suffered from enhanced mass loss . the weighted mean progenitor mass and white dwarf mass for the two stars in ngc  7789 , the two stars in ngc  6819 , and the masses of the single object in ngc  6791 are",
    "@xmath24    we illustrate these new points as filled circles on the initial - final mass relation in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the calculated initial progenitor masses ( for bright white dwarfs ) in these much older clusters are all essentially the same as the cooling ages are a very small fraction of the cluster ages .",
    "we have therefore plotted one data point for each cluster , which for the two clusters with multiple white dwarfs , represents the weighted mean of the system s progenitor and white dwarf masses .",
    "also shown is the 2@xmath25 error in each quantity for all three clusters ( see section  [ parameterizing ] for more information on this ) .",
    "as expected , these new data points provide constraints on the low mass end of the relation .",
    "they clearly indicate that the observed trend at higher masses ( suggesting more massive main - sequence stars produce more massive white dwarfs ) continues down to stars that are roughly one solar mass .",
    "most of the mass loss that a star suffers through its evolution occurs during very short lived post - main - sequence evolutionary phases such as the red giant branch , asymptotic giant branch , and planetary nebula phases ( e.g. , see reimers  1975 ) .",
    "in fact , it is the mass loss that is responsible for concluding fusion processes in the star and hence its rise in luminosity on the asymptotic giant branch . in principal",
    ", the masses of the stellar cores during these last phases of stellar evolution can be determined directly from modeling these evolutionary stages .",
    "an ideal model would then take an initial star of a certain mass ( @xmath19 @xmath26 8  @xmath1 ) and propagate it through all phases of stellar evolution to yield a remnant white dwarf with a particular mass . in practice , this has been very difficult because the mass loss mechanisms ( e.g. , helium flash and thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch ) are not theoretically understood well enough ( weidemann  2000 ; also see habing 1996 for a review ) .",
    "direct observational constraints are rare given the very short lifetimes of stars on the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula phases ( @xmath010@xmath27 years ) , and heavy obscuration of sources by dusty shells .",
    "recently , a few attempts have been made to calculate the rate of mass loss in asymptotic giant branch stars after factoring in parameters such as metallicity ( e.g. , marigo  2001 ) .",
    "we first present the mass of the stellar core at the first thermal pulse from one such calculation as a solid line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ifmr ] @xcite .",
    "as expected , this curve falls below the bulk of the data points as it represents an evolutionary point before the core of the star has had a chance to grow during the thermal pulses .",
    "note that the mass of the core is roughly constant for masses below 2  @xmath1 . from this initial point",
    ", @xcite performs synthetic calculations of the subsequent thermally pulsating phases of the asymptotic giant branch until the star has completely ejected its envelope ( see details in her paper ) .",
    "this can therefore be used to predict both the total mass loss and specific chemical yields as a function of initial mass and metallicity . for solar metallicity ,",
    "the theoretical initial - final mass relation from this work is shown as the dotted line in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] ( bottom ) . for @xmath12 4  @xmath1 ,",
    "this curve is systematically higher than the observed data , predicting final remnant masses that are too large by up to 0.1  @xmath1 . a test of this relation at the low mass end ( i.e. , the new data points with @xmath28 2  @xmath1 ) also finds final masses that are larger than our observations , however , the differences are very small .",
    "part of this difference may even be expected in the case of ngc  6791 given the 2.5@xmath10 higher metallicity of this cluster as compared to the solar metallicity theoretical relation ( see earlier discussion ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : massloss ] we present a different view of the initial - final mass relation to highlight the desired output from this work .",
    "the vertical axis now shows the total integrated mass loss through stellar evolution . for the most massive main - sequence stars that will form white dwarfs , this yield is about @xmath085% ( e.g. , the progenitor of white dwarf lb1497 in the pleiades cluster ) . a slightly less massive star such as the progenitor of sirius  b ( 5.06  @xmath1  liebert et  al .",
    "2005 ) has lost 80% of its mass .",
    "the mass loss smoothly decreases with stellar mass down to @xmath075% for intermediate mass stars , 3 @xmath11 @xmath29 4 @xmath1 .",
    "our new data points suggest a more rapid decline for stars with @xmath28 2  @xmath1 . at this mass",
    ", stars will lose @xmath070% of their total mass however this decreases down to just @xmath055% for stars approximately the mass of the sun .",
    "the theoretical calculation for solar metallicity discussed above is shown as the uppermost dotted curve @xcite .",
    "several authors have commented on the observed scatter in the initial - final mass relation ( e.g. , ferrario et  al .",
    "the present data set is very heterogeneous .",
    "the points on figure  [ fig : ifmr ] are derived from white dwarf observations in over ten star clusters .",
    "the quality of these data and procedures used to fit the spectra vary from one investigation to another and therefore small biases are likely to exist in the @xmath4 values .",
    "a small amount of field contamination may even exist in the sample .",
    "additionally , the ages of the star clusters have been derived by different authors using different assumptions , techniques , and isochrones and therefore the calculations involved in determining @xmath3 will also have biases . even within an individual study ,",
    "the large error bars in @xmath3 for the massive stars in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] are a good example of the difficulty in assigning masses to main - sequence lifetimes ( see ferrario et  al .",
    "2005 for a version of the relation with stars from individual clusters color coded ) . a small shift in the age of a cluster from 80 to 100  myr results in a @xmath90.5  @xmath1 systematic change in the inferred main - sequence mass at the turnoff .",
    "measuring the ages of clusters to this precision is very difficult for such young systems where the morphology of the turnoff is essentially vertical on an optical cmd .",
    "this is of course not a large concern in the study of older clusters since the turnoff can be well defined and the turnoff mass does not sensitively depend on the age .",
    "although characterizing the errors resulting from these uncertainties and heterogeneities is difficult , it is important to distinguish these biases from _ intrinsic _ scatter that may result from fundamental properties of stellar evolution .",
    "one way to minimize the systematic effects is to limit the study of a particular question to just the constraints from a few star clusters with many white dwarfs .",
    "for example , the hyades cluster @xcite is of similar age to ngc  2099 ( kalirai et  al",
    ".  2001c ; 2005a ) yet its chemical abundance is enriched by a factor of two ( @xmath30 = 0.025 and @xmath31 = 0.013 ) .",
    "models of stellar evolution predict that stars of higher metallicity will lose mass in post main - sequence phases more efficiently than stars of lower metallicity ( e.g. , marigo 2001 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : massloss ] .",
    "as we said above , the dotted line at the top represents the theoretical estimates for mass loss in solar metallicity stars .",
    "the two dotted lines underneath are the same relation for more metal - poor stars , @xmath23 = 0.008 and @xmath23 = 0.004 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , both the hyades and ngc  2099 harbor significant white dwarf populations that have been studied spectroscopically .",
    "@xcite showed that the mean mass of the ngc  2099 white dwarf population appears to be more massive ( by @xmath010% ) than the hyades stars , qualitatively consistent with the expectations from stellar evolution ( this is a 2@xmath25 effect in the mean mass of the populations ) .",
    "as already discussed , a convincing example of the efficiency of mass loss on metallicity is presented in @xcite .",
    "these cases highlight how the different properties of stars may play a role in contributing to the observed scatter on the initial - final mass relation .",
    "other properties of stars may also be important in understanding the scatter in the relation , such as rotation , binary evolution , and magnetic fields ( see weidemann  2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the present data does not permit a study of these effects .",
    "the mass loss mechanisms may themselves be stochastic to some degree . for example , @xcite measured masses of white dwarfs in the praesepe cluster using gravitational redshifts and found a large dispersion in the remnant mass distribution ( 0.6  0.9  @xmath1 ) .",
    "an estimate of the initial masses of these stars suggests that they were all produced from stars of about the same mass .",
    "this would then suggest that there is no singular initial - final mass relation .",
    "however , @xcite reconcile this picture by suggesting that one of the outlier stars in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 plane of the praesepe sample ( lb  5893 ) may have formed from close binary evolution .",
    "a better understanding of these types of effects will require a larger data set , as we discuss below .",
    "deriving a functional form of the initial - final mass relation from the available data is problematic for several reasons .",
    "first , for the reasons discussed above , such a parameterization may be meaningless given the uncertain degree to which second order properties of stars may effect their mass loss .",
    "second , the relation is only constrained over a fraction of the total mass range that is of interest . prior to this work ,",
    "the low mass end of the relation was completely devoid of any observations of individual white dwarfs with direct mass measurements .",
    "the high mass end continues to be sparsely populated , the degree to which depends on the maximum mass of a star that will form a white dwarf ( the current high mass point is at @xmath3 = 6.5  @xmath1 , ferrario et  al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "@xcite calculates a semi - empirical initial - final mass relation based on the available data at the time . at the low mass end",
    ", his relation is constrained by an anchor point at @xmath3 = 1  @xmath1 , @xmath4 = 0.55  @xmath1 which is in good agreement with the mass of the core at the first thermal pulse .",
    "the general shape of the relation and possible slope changes are discussed in detail .",
    "interestingly , at the low mass end the data indicate that the relation flattens off as the initial - mass scale continues down to 0.8  @xmath1 , similar to the core - radius relation shown in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] .",
    "the ngc  6819 data point at @xmath3 = 1.61  @xmath1 , @xmath4 = 0.54  @xmath1 is already within a few hundredths of a solar mass of the core mass ( @xmath00.5  @xmath1 depending on @xmath23 , see core mass relation in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] ; also pietrinferni et  al .",
    "the final mass of the carbon - oxygen core white dwarf in ngc  6791 is slightly lower than this , and equal to the expected mass of white dwarfs in globular clusters ( @xmath4 = 0.53  @xmath1 ; renzini & fusi  pecci 1988 ; renzini et  al .",
    "1996 ; moehler et  al .",
    "2004 ) with present day turnoffs of @xmath3 = 0.8  @xmath1 .",
    "this flattening of the relation suggests an exponential - like behavior at low masses .",
    "unfortunately , such a parameterization would not fit the high mass end of the relation very well since those data also appear to show a flattening off .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the higher mass stars may in fact form white dwarfs that are structurally different in that they have neon / oxygen cores instead of carbon - oxygen cores . reproducing the relation for stars with masses greater than @xmath04.5",
    "@xmath1 can be accomplished with a log function , however this would grossly mismatch the masses of the white dwarfs at the low mass end .    lacking a satisfactory functional form of the type discussed above over the entire mass range in figure  [ fig : ifmr ] , we resort to a simple linear fit as performed in the synthesis given by @xcite .",
    "these authors took advantage of several recent studies ( see earlier references ) that have now more than doubled the amount of data as compared to the @xcite study ( all for @xmath12 2.75  @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , unlike that study , we will use no anchor point to fix the relation at the low mass end which is otherwise needed to avoid a meaningless slope given the large scatter at intermediate masses ( ferrario et  al .",
    "introduced a point at @xmath3 = 1.1  @xmath1 , @xmath4 = 0.55  @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also follow the approach introduced by @xcite and bin the relation so that each star cluster is represented as a single point ( including sirius  b ) .",
    "this has a few advantages .",
    "first , our fit will not be over - influenced by the region of the relation with the most data points .",
    "second , the standard deviation in the distribution of masses of white dwarfs within a given cluster is a random error on the relation when comparing different clusters @xcite .",
    "when plotting individual data points , an error in the age of a cluster will lead to a systematic offset of all points on the relation for that cluster .",
    "third , our results will be less sensitive to any possible peculiar white dwarfs whose initial and final masses are measured accurately .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of the binned approach is that a given cluster is expected to have white dwarfs with a range of initial and final masses and therefore we are throwing away this information .",
    "the initial - final mass relation based on this binned method is shown in figure  [ fig : ifmrcluster ] .",
    "we note that the 2@xmath25 outlier at @xmath3 = 5.06  @xmath1 is sirius  b @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in this plot are the standard deviations in the mean initial and final mass .",
    "the solid line represents our weighted linear least - squares best fit ,    @xmath32    although an `` s '' shaped relation with curvature would provide a better fit at both the lower and upper ends , we note that the reduced chi squared per degree of freedom is @xmath33 = 1.2 in the linear fit and therefore the data are well - fit by this simple relation .",

    "a mapping of the initial mass of a hydrogen burning star to its final remnant mass represents an extremely important relation in astrophysics . over 99% of all stars",

    "the study of the white dwarf population in ngc  7789 , ngc  6819 , and ngc  6791 represents the first time that we have been able to reconstruct this mapping for low mass stars such as the sun , and therefore eliminate the need for an indirect anchor point at low masses . over half of the total number of stars that are produced in a salpeter - type initial mass function now fall within a region of the initial - final mass relation that has some constraints .",
    "at high masses , the relation indicates that stars will lose 80  85% of their mass through stellar evolution .",
    "however , for stars approximately as massive as the sun , this number drops to @xmath055% of the initial stellar mass .    despite these new data ,",
    "the importance of the initial - final mass relation demands further observations . to better understand the intrinsic scatter ,",
    "future observations should focus on older clusters with clearly defined white dwarf cooling sequences ( such as ngc  7789 ) . by pushing the magnitude limit fainter",
    ", more massive white dwarfs will be revealed that are likely descendents of more massive progenitors . in this way",
    ", multiple initial - final mass relations can be constructed over appreciable ranges from the studies of _ single _ star clusters whose properties ( age , metallicity , binary fraction , etc ... ) have been measured carefully .",
    "such studies are ideally suited for multi - object spectrographs since the white dwarf luminosity function increases as a function of magnitude and therefore a large number of objects can be targeted in a single exposure .",
    "to truly push the envelope to even lower masses , globular clusters should be targeted as well .",
    "the nearest systems , such as m4 and ngc  6397 , can be studied with 810 meter telescopes ( e.g. , see moehler et  al .",
    "in addition to providing constraints down to @xmath00.8  @xmath1 , the environments of these systems are up to 100@xmath10 more metal - poor than most open clusters and therefore metallicity trends can be reliably studied . at the opposite extreme",
    ", rich , young clusters can provide unique constraints and push the current high mass limit further .",
    "this will not only constrain the upper mass limit to white dwarf production , but also simultaneously discover the lower mass limit to type ii supernova .",
    "an extrapolation of the present relation to the chandrasekhar mass suggests an initial mass of @xmath09.5  @xmath1 , however this is very uncertain given the lack of data in this regime .",
    "finally , there is a paucity of data between @xmath3 = 2  2.75  @xmath1 which can bridge our new measurements with the previous data .",
    "the absence of data points in this region of the relation results from a lack of nearby , rich star clusters with an age of @xmath01  gyr .",
    "fortunately , one such system exists , ngc  2420 , and has been shown to possess a white dwarf population @xcite and therefore should be targeted in the near future .",

    "<S> the initial - final mass relation represents a mapping between the mass of a white dwarf remnant and the mass that the hydrogen burning main - sequence star that created it once had . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical relation thus far has been constrained using a sample of @xmath040 stars in young open clusters , ranging in initial mass from @xmath02.75  7  @xmath1 , and shows a general trend that connects higher mass main - sequence stars with higher mass white dwarfs . in this paper , we present cfht / cfh12k photometric and keck / lris multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of 22 white dwarfs in two _ older _ open clusters , ngc 7789 ( @xmath2 = 1.4  gyr ) and ngc 6819 ( @xmath2 = 2.5  gyr ) . at these ages , stars in these clusters with masses as low as 1.6  @xmath1 have already evolved off the main sequence and formed white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we measure masses for the highest s / n spectra by fitting the balmer lines to atmosphere models and place the first direct constraints on the low mass end of the initial - final mass relation . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the observed general trend at higher masses continues down to low masses , with @xmath3 = 1.6  @xmath1 main - sequence stars forming @xmath4 = 0.54  @xmath1 white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> when added to our new data from the very old cluster ngc  6791 , the relation is extended down to @xmath3 = 1.16  @xmath1 ( corresponding to @xmath4 = 0.53  @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this extension of the relation represents a four fold increase in the total number of hydrogen burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now be calculated from empirical data , assuming a salpeter initial mass function . the new leverage at the low mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial - final mass relation for the entire sample of stars , without the need for any indirectly measured anchor points . </S>",
    "<S> the sample of white dwarfs in these clusters also shows several very interesting systems that we discuss further : a db ( helium atmosphere ) white dwarf , a magnetic white dwarf , a dab ( mixed hydrogen / helium atmosphere or a double degenerate da+db ) white dwarf(s ) , and two possible equal mass da double degenerate binary systems . </S>"
