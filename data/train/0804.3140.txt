    "we begin with an analysis of the low and high - resolution stokes  @xmath8 spectra , extending over 5 years .",
    "these spectra are used for establishing the rotation period of the star , as well as the mean field modulus of the low- and strong - field components .",

    "these conclusions were made on the basis of the high - resolution spectroscopy of the zeeman pattern in the h@xmath0 core .    in our low - resolution fors1 and bta observations ,",
    "zeeman splitting attributed to the low - field component can not be resolved spectroscopically . in the spectra",
    "the splitting is revealed as an additional variable broadening and desaturation of the h@xmath0 core . in this case ,",
    "measurements of the low - field component can be carried out by an analysis of the equivalent widths ( @xmath35 ) of the h@xmath0 core .",
    "using field modulus @xmath32 values determined by @xcite from an analysis of individual high - resolution h@xmath0 line profiles and measuring equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 cores , we may try to calibrate the relationship @xmath35@xmath32 to allow us to determine @xmath32 in the low - resolution spectra . to obtain the required calibration",
    ", we estimated equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 core from the high resolution spectra obtained by @xcite . in order to work with measurements having a uniform resolution ,",
    "all high - resolution spectra were convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile to reproduce the spectral resolution of fors1 and uags .",
    "the resultant spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the profiles are strongly variable .",
    "the central intensity of the core also correlates with the intensity of the strong - field zeeman features which are found in the wings of the h@xmath0 profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : the two satellite features at @xmath3610   around the h@xmath0 core ) .",
    "this correlation ( the higher the intensity of the features , the weaker the central intensity ) is due to the fact that the spot , which appears periodically on the visible disc due to rotation , redistributes the flux according its projected area . it is also seen that the width of the h@xmath0 core is variable itself due to the variable zeeman pattern of the line core . therefore , to minimize the influence of the variable high - field spectral features in measurements of the central zeeman pattern attributed to the low - field component , we artificially re - normalized all the profiles to equal residual intensities ( @xmath37 at the line center ) and measured equivalent widths of the central narrow portion ( @xmath38 ) of the resultant h@xmath0 profiles . in these conditions ,",
    "the variation of the @xmath39 core is attributed only to the rotationally modulated low - field component .",
    "as hoped , we find a close correlation between the @xmath35 measured in this way and the value of @xmath32 measured by maxted .",
    "this relation is shown in fig.4 .",
    "finally , using the @xmath40 relationship derived from the high - resolution spectra as illustrated in fig.4 , we inferred the field modulus @xmath32 associated with each of the low - resolution spectra ( see table  [ tbl2 ] ) .      in order to measure the magnetic field modulus @xmath41 of the strong - field component we deblended the h@xmath0 profile by means of a simultaneous fit of five gaussian profiles ( three central profiles used to fit the h@xmath0 core , and two satellite gaussians to reproduce the strong - field zeeman pattern ) .",
    "this method enabled us to reproduce the zeeman splitting of the strong - field component and the corresponding magnetic field strength in those spectra where the strong - field spectral features are seen .",
    "the method also allows us to estimate the projected fractional area @xmath34 of the strong - field area on the disc .",
    "reconstructing by gaussians and extracting the zeeman pattern of the strong field component from the observed h@xmath0 line profiles , we determined @xmath34 , the fraction of the flux absorbed by the strong - field pattern relative to the total h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the method is rather rough and can be considered as a first - guess approximation that is necessary for the analysis described below .",
    "a more realistic calculation of the size of the strong - field area is performed in sect.8 where we model the spectra .",
    "the results ( @xmath42 and @xmath34 ) are presented in table  [ tbl3 ] .",
    "@xmath34 is given in per cent of the disc area .",
    "from the stokes  @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectra obtained with the vlt and bta we determined longitudinal fields through the weak - field approximation @xcite modified to the analysis of the two - component stokes  @xmath9 spectra :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the longitudinal field of the low - field component , @xmath45 describes the gradient of the flux profile , @xmath34 is the relative area of the spot projected on the disc , @xmath46 is the h@xmath0 rest wavelength and @xmath47 is the stokes  @xmath9 profile from the strong - field component observed in the h@xmath0 wings .    in eq.(4 )",
    "we effectively separate the disc into two equivalent areas with different averaged magnetic field strengths .",
    "the first term in the equation describes the weak - field area and the second term is attributed to the strong - field component .",
    "the first term is used in the usual manner according to which the flux and its gradient are taken directly from the observed spectra .",
    "( inaccuracies due to the presence of the strong - field features in the wings are comparatively weak : these features are located quite far from the line core and do not affect the narrow central low - field polarization profile ) . however , circular polarization @xmath47 from the strong - field component ( the second term in the equation ) can not be fitted in the same way .    in order to fit @xmath47 and estimate the longitudinal field of the strong - field area , we compute :    @xmath48     + where the flux @xmath49 is the observed h@xmath0 flux profile , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the left- and right - hand polarized parts of the h@xmath0 profile from the strong - field equivalent area of the disc . in the observed polarization spectra @xmath50 and @xmath51 are mixed with fluxes from the weak - field equivalent area and therefore can not be extracted directly .",
    "however , we may estimate them with some simplifications .",
    "individually , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are zeeman - split profiles of the circularly polarized satellite @xmath52 components . due to the fact that the @xmath53 component is absent in @xmath51 , and the @xmath54 component is absent in @xmath50 ,",
    "their centers of gravity are displaced , indicating the presence of the longitudinal field from the strong - field area .",
    "their difference provides the non - zero circular polarization ( eqn.5 ) .",
    "because @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not resolved in the total left- and right - circularly polarized observed fluxes , the determination of their true shapes requires detailed modeling the field geometry .",
    "however , as a first - guess approximation we may describe them by simulating an equivalent `` mean '' zeeman - broadened h@xmath0 profile magnetically displaced to the left- and right - sides from the rest wavelength . with this simplification only two parameters   zeeman broadening and their magnetic displacement due to the averaged longitudinal field from the spot should be varied to reproduce the observed circular polarization .",
    "in the simulation procedure we may use a template h@xmath0 profile , artificially broadened to unresolved zeeman patterns typical for @xmath51 and @xmath50 and magnetically displaced .",
    "this template can be taken from a zero magnetic field solution for the atmosphere of wd1953 - 011 or from the observed spectra .",
    "for example , assuming the pressure - temperature conditions in the spot area to be similar to conditions in the other parts of the white dwarf s surface we may choose as the template one of the observed weak - field h@xmath0 profiles ( obtained at those moments when the spot is not seen ) . in our analysis we proceed this way .",
    "thus , to simulate @xmath50 and @xmath51 in order to fit the circular polarization ( 5 ) from the strong - field area and estimate its longitudinal magnetic field we used the following iterative method : +    * * step-1 : * we construct the reference weak - field `` template '' h@xmath0 profile from the observed i - profiles obtained at those rotational phases where the strong - field zeeman pattern is not seen . +",
    "* * step-2 : * we artificially broaden the template profile by a gaussian filter with an arbitrary half - width to an unresolved strong - field zeeman pattern and displace the result by the magnetic displacement factor @xmath55 to the shorter / longer wavelengths to estimate the @xmath50 and @xmath51 profiles . * * step-3 : * varying the magnetic broadening of the estimated profiles @xmath50 and @xmath51 and their zeeman displacement we finally fit the strong - field circular polarization ( 5 ) in the working equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the displacement found @xmath56 @xcite , gives an estimate of the longitudinal field @xmath57 .",
    "( in other words , taking @xmath34 measured from the stokes  @xmath8 spectra and presented in table  [ tbl3 ] we simultaneously fit the observed combined stokes  @xmath9 ( 4 ) varying @xmath44 and circular polarization ( 5 ) of the strong - field component , where @xmath57 is one of the parameters . )    in the fit procedure , the associated error bars are obtained using the monte carlo modeling method presented by @xcite .",
    "an example of the fit is presented in fig .",
    "the results are collected in table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "this method gives quite robust estimates of the longitudinal magnetic field of the low - field component . in the case of the strong - field component",
    ", the real intensities of the fields could be slightly over or underestimated due to the simplifications described above .",
    "for these reasons , estimates of the strong - field component given here could be considered to be approximate . as an alternative",
    ", the two - component circular polarization spectra could be analyzed by using zeeman tomography ( * ? ? ? * for instance ) . to provide more precise modeling , below ( sec.8 )",
    "we analyze our data again in the framework of simplified zeeman tomography .",
    "to search for the star s rotation period we used the equivalent widths @xmath35 of the h@xmath0 core determined in sect.4 .",
    "this observable is the most sensitive indicator for the determination of the rotation period . to determine the rotation period we applied the lafler - kinman method @xcite , as modified by @xcite .",
    "analysis of the power spectrum of the data revealed a signal indicating a probable period between 1.4 and 1.5  days ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the period estimate ( @xmath58days ) given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "detailed study of the periodogram showed that the most significant sinusoidal signal corresponds to a period p  =  1.4480  @xmath36  0.0001  days .",
    "other peaks are located around 1.447 days and 1.442 days .",
    "an examination of these periods reveals distorted , non - sinusoidal signals and we do not consider these periods further .    the phase variation of the h@xmath0 core equivalent widths @xmath35 derived with this period is presented in fig .",
    "the derived period shows a very good agreement among all the observations taken from different telescopes ( the vlt , bta and aat ) .",
    "for the minimum of @xmath35 we obtain the following ephemeris : @xmath59    the corresponding phase curves of the mean field modulus @xmath32 and longitudinal field @xmath60 of the weak - field components are presented in fig .",
    "the phase curves are almost sinusoidal , and symmetric about the values of about @xmath32  =  @xmath61 kg and @xmath60  =  @xmath62 kg .",
    "the modulus of the weak - field component varies from @xmath63 kg to @xmath64 kg ; the longitudinal magnetic field shows variation in the range @xmath65 kg to @xmath66 kg .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the behavior of the longitudinal magnetic field and modulus of the weak - field component suggest the field geometry to be a simple , low - order poloidal field , which supports our view that the period is correct .",
    "below we use this period in analyzing the magnetic field morphology of wd1953 - 011 . at the same time it is important to note that another estimate of the rotational period ( p  =  1.4418  days ) obtained by @xcite from differential photometry of this mwd is similar to , but formally different from , our result . following the next section , where we establish the magnetic field morphology of the low - field component , we will discuss this difference in more detail .",
    "to verify that the behavior of the weak - field component of wd1953 - 011 is consistent with a nearly dipolar geometry , we have followed the schematic method proposed by @xcite .",
    "this method has already been described and applied to establish the magnetic field morphology of the weak field white dwarf wd0009 + 501 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for this reason here we do not explain all the modeling details , but restrict ourselves to the presentation of the results .    in this paper we model the phase - resolved measurements of the mean longitudinal field and mean field modulus of the weak - field component within the framework of a pure dipole and dipole+quadrupole field .",
    "the phase - resolved observables for the weak - field component which we use as input data are obtained by binning measurements in phase and averaging .",
    "the binned data are presented in table  [ tbl5 ] .",
    "the dipole or dipole plus quadrupole models depend on the following 10 parameters :    * @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the dipole and quadrupole strength , respectively ; * @xmath69 , the stellar equatorial velocity ; * @xmath70 , the inclination of the stellar rotation axis to the line of sight ; * @xmath29 , the angle between the dipolar axis and the rotation axis ; * @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the analogues of @xmath29 for the directions identified by the quadrupole ; * @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the azimuthal angles of the unit vectors of the quadrupole ; * @xmath75 , the `` reference '' rotational phase of the model ; * @xmath76 , the projected stellar rotation velocity .    the angles @xmath70 , @xmath29 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 range from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , while @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 range from @xmath77 to @xmath79 .",

    "( note that the pure dipole model would retain as free parameters only @xmath67 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath29 , and @xmath75 . )    for the stellar mass , @xcite gave the value of @xmath82 , which together with known surface gravity of wd1953 - 011 ( @xmath83 , @xcite ) correspond to a stellar radius of about @xmath84 .",
    "this parameter and the period were then used to estimate the equatorial and projected velocities of the star .    for the limb - darkening coefficient",
    ", we adopted the value of @xmath85 .",
    "note that , as discussed by @xcite , the results of the modeling are only slightly influenced by the @xmath81 value .",
    "the best - fit parameters are : + _ a ) dipole _",
    "+ @xmath86    _ b ) dipole + quadrupole _",
    "+ @xmath87 note that , as explained by @xcite , the available observations do not allow one to distinguish between two magnetic configurations symmetrical about the plane containing the rotation axis and the dipole axis .",
    "such configurations are characterized by the same values of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , while the remaining angles are related by @xmath88   ( & 180\\degr -i,&180\\degr -\\beta,&180\\degr -\\beta_1,&180\\degr -\\beta_2&)\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] due to the fact that the spin axis angle is close to a pole - on orientation and due to the small number of available observables , the error bars on the derived quantities are fairly large .",
    "for the same reasons , there are some uncertainties in the determinations of all the parameters considered together . however , despite these weakness , we are able to obtain some conclusions about the most probable geometry of the white dwarf s global field .",
    "the best fit of the dipole+quadrupole model applied to the observations is shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line shows the fit obtained using the pure dipolar morphology . as is evident",
    ", the dipolar model does not reproduce the observations well .",
    "examination of the reduced @xmath89 statistics shows that the quality of the dipole+quadrupole fit ( @xmath90 for longitudinal field and field modulus , respectively ) is significantly better than the pure dipole fit ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the large - scale weak - field component of wd1953 - 011 is better modeled by the superposition of a dipole and quadrupole components .",
    "in contrast to the well - organized , nearly sinusoidal variation of the weak - field component , the phase behavior of the high - field structure exhibits a number of peculiar features that made it impossible to model these data as a simple low - order multipole :    * according to the measurements of the zeeman - split satellite spectral features in the h@xmath0 wings , the mean field modulus of the strong - field component does not show any noticeable variation during the star s rotation .",
    "( due to rotation , we see variation of the flux intensities from the strong - field area , but the corresponding zeeman displacement is nearly constant . ) the most likely explanation @xcite is that there is an area with a nearly uniformly distributed strong magnetic field .",
    "this explanation , if true , suggests that the strong - field component has a localized geometry and can not be understood as a high - field term in the multipolar expansion of the star s general field . averaging all the data we determine @xmath92  kg . *",
    "the zeeman pattern attributed to the strong - field component becomes visible at rotational phases @xmath93 and demonstrates variation in the flux intensities that suggests rotational variability of the projected effective size @xmath34 of the magnetic spot .",
    "the projected area of the strong - field structure varies from zero to about 12% of the disk , consistent with the study of @xcite .",
    "this observable can be used as an additional parameter to test the rotational period of the star . however , using this quantity to search for the period we did not find a regular signal at any period within the tested 5-year time base .",
    "moreover , phasing the data with the magnetic ephemeris characterized by the rotational period of 1.448 days , the resultant phase curve of the spot size variation ( fig.10 ) appears distorted in comparison to the well - organized behavior of the weak - field component phased with the same ephemeris .",
    "we observe a small relative phase shift between the data obtained with different telescopes that may indicate a possible secular longitudinal drift of the strong - field component . *",
    "the averaged longitudinal field of the strong field area varies from zero ( when the area is invisible ) to about 450  kg ( table  [ tbl4 ] ) which is comparable to the averaged mean field modulus ( @xmath94 kg ) of the field .",
    "this suggests a deviation of the strong field component from any of low - order multipolar geometries for which the difference between the full vector and its longitudinal projection should much larger ( for example , for a centered dipole field the difference should be at least 2.5 times , @xcite ) .",
    "the last point suggests the presence of an essentially vertical orientation of the magnetic field lines relative to the star s surface , typical for local magnetic flux tubes in cool , convective stars ( the sun for example ) .",
    "if the geometry is a tube seen as a local magnetic spot in the photosphere , we may also expect the above - mentioned secular drift . to our knowledge and by an analogy to the sun , such fields are expected to show dynamical activity like migration over the star s surface and be associated with dark spots that might produce photometric variability of the star .",
    "significant photometric variability of wd1953 - 011 has been established @xcite . however , in this paper we are unable to establish the association of the darkness and magnetic spots for reasons which we discuss below .      measuring the longitudinal magnetic field of the strong - field component",
    "as described in sect.5 we noted that the estimates of the longitudinal field of the strong - field area might be affected by our simplifying assumptions . in order to control these measurements",
    "we have also directly modeled the observed polarization and intensity h@xmath0 spectra of the star without parametrizing the surface field components .",
    "in addition to the analysis of the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectra , the observed @xmath12 and @xmath11 spectra were also taken into consideration . as can be seen in fig.1 , linear polarization stokes @xmath95 signatures are detected only marginally at a few rotational phases .",
    "however , this information can also be used to constrain the magnetic geometry of the degenerate .",
    "note that different magnetic geometries may produce similar stokes @xmath9 spectral features due to axial symmetry of circular polarization provided by the longitudinal projection of the field .",
    "linear polarization restricts the strength and orientation of the transverse field that , together with circular polarization , makes it possible to resolve the geometry spatially . the observed @xmath12 and @xmath11 spectra are mainly noise , but we may try to use them in terms of the upper limits .",
    "in our model we examined several low order multipolar magnetic field geometries , integrating over the surface elementary ( taken at a single surface element ) stokes @xmath10 , and @xmath11 spectra calculated for various field strengths and orientations of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the technique we used to calculate the elementary spectra deserves some special explanation .",
    "+ _ a ) simulation of the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 synthetic h@xmath0 spectra . _",
    "+ generally , accurate simulation of the split balmer profiles in spectra of strong magnetic white dwarfs requires detailed computations of the main opacity sources under the influence of strong magnetic fields . to our knowledge",
    ", these computations have not yet been tabulated for practical use .",
    "for this reason , a self - consistent solution of the transfer equation for the line profiles in spectra of strong - magnetic white dwarfs can not be performed without special consideration of additional parameters ( related , for example , to the stark broadening in the presence of a strong magnetic field , @xcite ) . however , in case of the weak - field degenerates we may restrict ourself to a zero - field solution similar to that presented by @xcite or by @xcite .",
    "the method assumes that if the stark broadening dominates the line opacity , the total opacity can be calculated as the sum of individual stark - broadened zeeman components .",
    "the stark broadening is suggested to be taken as `` non - magnetic '' in this case . under these simplifying assumptions",
    "we may simulate the local , elementary zeeman spectra using one of the following two ways :    * to compute the transfer equation for all stokes parameters at given strength and orientation of a local magnetic field line calculating the h@xmath0 opacities as described , or ( alternatively ) * to select a `` template '' h@xmath0 profile typical for a zero - field white dwarf with the same pressure - temperature conditions as in wd1953 - 011 for construction of the elementary zeeman spectra .",
    "( in other words , we may try to construct from this template profile individual zeeman @xmath96 and @xmath97 components , parametrizing their magnetic displacement and relative intensities , and additively combine them to obtain the elementary @xmath98 h@xmath0 profiles . )",
    "the first , direct method of atmospheric calculations for wd1953 - 011 requires special theoretical tools which are outside the scope of this observational paper .",
    "the second , simplified method , which we will use , seems to be rather rough due to the fact that the fluxes from the individual @xmath96 and @xmath97 components obtained by using the zero - field template profile are generally not additive ( whereas their corresponding opacities can be added in the transfer equation ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the linear guess approximation they can be taken as additive and the method can also be applied . besides , testing this method on some standard , well - studied magnetic ap / bp stars we have obtained satisfactory results modeling their observed polarizations .",
    "this allowed us to conclude that the method is reasonably accurate .",
    "thus , to calculate the elementary @xmath98 h@xmath0 profiles we adopted the use of the zero - field h@xmath0 template profile which was constructed from the observed i - spectra obtained at those moments , when the strong - field zeeman pattern is not seen .",
    "the stark parts of the profile were obtained by averaging the @xmath8 profiles at the rotation phases 0 and 0.91 ( see fig.1 ) in which the strong - field features are not seen .",
    "the central `` zero - field '' doppler profile was adopted to reproduce in the model procedure the observed low - field magnetic broadening of the h@xmath0 cores at phases 0 and 0.91 .",
    "the necessary individual profiles of the non - displaced @xmath96 and displaced @xmath97 components were obtained by entering the normal zeeman displacements according to the orientation of the local magnetic field : the circularly polarized @xmath97 components are displaced according to the longitudinal projection of the local magnetic field , and the linearly polarized @xmath97 components are displaced by the transverse field .    in order to model the polarization h@xmath0 profiles , the relative intensities of the central @xmath96 and displaced @xmath99 components were computed from the prjection of the local field vector onto the plane on the sky and on the line of sight as described by @xcite ( for a qualitative explanation see also @xcite ) .",
    "the final intensities of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 components were obtained by renormalisation such that the total sum of the fluxes from all the components be equal to the flux from the zero - field template h@xmath0 profile .",
    "finally , the elementary @xmath96 and @xmath97 components were combined to construct from them the elementary @xmath98 spectra by simulation of the ordinary and extraordinary beams given by a polarimetric analyzer .",
    "for example , simulating the h@xmath0 stokes @xmath9 profile , all the components except the circularly polarized @xmath97 components are equally distributed between the beams .",
    "the circularly polarized @xmath54 components are absent in one of the beams , and the oppositely polarized @xmath53 components are absent in the other beam .",
    "the final stokes @xmath9 h@xmath0 profile was obtained by subtraction of the ordinary from extraordinary beams and devision of the result by the total flux .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath11 spectra were obtained in a similar way : the linearly polarized @xmath52 components and central @xmath100 component are distributed between the beams according to the projection of the local magnetic field onto the plane of the sky .",
    "after the determination of the elementary @xmath98 spectra given by a magnetic geometry in all surface elements , we finally integrated and averaged them over the disc .",
    "for the limb - darkening coefficient we adopted the value of @xmath85 .",
    "b ) modeling the field geometry in wd1953 - 011 by simulation of the observed polarization spectra .",
    "_    in sect.5 ) we have concluded , that estimates of the longitudinal magnetic field based on the weak - field approximation are accurate enough to make it possible to model the geometry of the low - field component separately from the strong - field component in the manner as demostrated in sect.7 . for this reason , and in order to reduce a number of variables , we use those results ( obtained in sect.7 ) as input and non - changeable parameters in the tomography .",
    "we just note , that modeling the observed spectra obtained at those time moments , where the spot is not seen , we have confirmed , that the observations ( stokes - v spectra ) can be better fit by the dipole+quadrupole geometry of the low - field component with parameters performed in sect.7 ( case _ b _ ) .",
    "examination of the pure dipole model ( case _ a _ ) gives no satisfactory results and we do not use this case here .    modeling the strong - field area as an additional harmonic in the low - order ( lower than octupole ) multipolar expansion we were unable to reproduce the observations .",
    "the fit does not provide the necessary contrast in the observed zeeman patterns at those phases where the polarization and intensity spectra demonstrate the weak- and strong - field zeeman features together .",
    "however , assuming the strong - field component to be concentrated into a localized area having maximum projected size of about 12 per cent of the disk , the strong - field zeeman spectral features can be well - reproduced with an average magnetic field of @xmath101 kg .",
    "practically the same result has been obtained by @xcite .    to model the strong - field area we tested two simplified localized geometries : a `` contrast spot '' with a homogeneously distributed , essentially vertical magnetic field , and a `` sagittal '' geometry with a strong vertically - oriented central magnetic field , that smoothly decreased to zero at the spot edges .",
    "generally , both geometries are able to describe the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectra with more or less acceptable accuracy . the first model , however , does not provide us with a good fit of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 spectra due to the presence of the sharp ( and non - physical ) jump of the field intensity at the edges of the strong - field area . for this reason we do not discuss this case in detail .",
    "the `` sagittal '' geometry of the strong - field area was constructed by using a modified model of a centered dipole : about 45% of the spot s area ( central parts ) have the dipolar distribution with polar field @xmath102 kg at the center .",
    "the remaining 55% of the external dipolar field is artificially modulated to have a gradual decrease to zero at the edges of the area .",
    "this model provides a good fit of the stokes @xmath103 spectra and reasonable reproduction of the linear polarization q-,u - spectra , as shown in fig.11 where we also illustrate the tomographic portrait of the white dwarf s magnetosphere .    despite the fact that we obtain such a good agreement of the `` sagittal '' geometry with the observables from the strong - field area",
    ", we do not claim that this geometry is fully correct in all details ( for example , the model does not control conservation of magnetic flux ) .",
    "similar to the case of the weak - field component , the most natural way to study the strong - field area is to describe it as a strong - field feature resulting from the superposition of several high - order harmonics in the multipolar expansion . at this time we are unable to study this term using any combination of the first hamonics higher than octupole , but we do not exclude that the use of the highest terms of different polarities and intensities will resolve the problem .",
    "however , this result clearly demonstrates a qualitative difference in the morphologies of the strong - field area and the global field of the white dwarf . from the model we establish with a very high probability that the strong - field area has a localized structure with essentially vertical orientation of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the physical size of the area is about 20% of the star s surface giving maximum 12% projection on the disc .",
    "the spot is located at an angle of about @xmath104 with respect to the spin axis , providing a maximum longitudinal field strength of about 400 kg .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the measurements of the longitudinal field of the spot .",
    "we have presented new low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the magnetic white dwarf wd1953 - 011 . from these observations and observations of previous authors",
    "we have determined the star s rotation period , mean longitudinal field , mean field modulus , and surface field morphology .",
    "let us finally summarize these results .",
    "* our present picture of wd1953 - 011 consists of a mwd with relatively smooth , low - field global magnetic field component , and a high - field magnetic area .",
    "* the low - field component demonstrates regular periodicity with period @xmath105  days .",
    "we interpret this as the rotational period of the white dwarf .",
    "the long - term stability of the surface and longitudinal magnetic fields of the low - field component enable us to interpret this component as a fossil poloidal magnetic field consisting of dipolar and quadrupolar harmonics with the following basic parameters : + 1 ) the inclination of stellar rotation axis @xmath106 ; + 2 ) the angle between the dipolar axis and the rotation axis @xmath107 ; + 3 ) the dipole strength @xmath108 kg ; + 4 ) the quadrupole strength @xmath109 kg . + * the strong - field component exhibits a peculiar localized structure .",
    "the mean field modulus of the spot @xmath42 is estimated to be @xmath110  kg , which is consistent with the results presented by @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field of the spot varies with rotational phase from @xmath111  kg to about @xmath112  kg . comparing the mean field modulus with the maximum longitudinal field we suggest that the geometry of the high - field spot may be similar to a magnetic flux tube with vertically - oriented magnetic field lines .",
    "the spot is located at an angle of @xmath113 with respect to the spin axis .",
    "our results suggest that the magnetic field of wd1953 - 011 consists of two physically different morphologies - the fossil poloidal field and an apparently induced magnetic spot . to our knowledge ,",
    "fossil , slowly decaying global magnetic fields are organized in a nearly force - free poloidal configuration .",
    "creates in the atmospheric plasma an isotropic pressure @xmath114 and tension @xmath115 directed along the magnetic lines of force .",
    "while neighboring lines of force of a magnetic field try to expand due to the magnetic pressure , tension tends to compensate for this effect .",
    "the force - free configuration is possible only when the gradient of the magnetic pressure is fully compensated by the tension forces . ] in contrast , if the suggested vertical orientation of the magnetic field lines in the spot is correct , the uncompensated `` magnetic pressure''@xmath116 of such a localized field may dominate against the tension causing a strong impact on the pressure - temperature balance in the photosphere of the degenerate .",
    "this may produce a temperature difference between the strong - field area and other parts of the star s surface .",
    "as a result we may expect rotationally - modulated photometric variability of wd1953 - 011 ( as observed by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons ( and by analogy to sunspots ) such fields might be unstable if not supported by other dynamical processes such as differential rotation , and may therefore exhibit secular drift with respect to the stellar rotation axis .    in the above context",
    "we note that significant photometric variability of wd1953 - 011 has been established @xcite .",
    "also , remarkably , the authors had encountered problems analyzing the periodicity of the variable differential flux . when individual epochs of their photometric data are phased according to the rotation period of about 1.45 days , the resultant folded lightcurves are smooth and approximately sinusoidal .",
    "however , they had difficulty obtaining an acceptable fit to all epochs of photometric data considered simultaneously @xcite .",
    "besides , periodograms @xcite obtained separately for their 7 individual observing runs indicate _ a significant spread in the period distribution_. the individual peaks are stochastically distributed around a rotation period @xmath117 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 , also suggesting a probable phase shift from epoch to epoch with characteristic times from tens to hundred of days . combining all the data",
    ", they establish their version ot the rotation period @xmath120days .",
    "this period is significantly different from the period derived by us from the behavior of the global field of the star ( p  =  1.448  @xmath36  0.0001  days ) .",
    "indirectly , these facts suggest a physical relationship between the darkness and magnetic spots , and their possible secular migration .",
    "unfortunately , our spectroscopy and the available photometry were obtained at different epochs , making it impossible to study this relationship in this paper .",
    "examination of these problems will be among the goals of our further study of this magnetic degenerate upon carrying out the necessary simultaneous photometric and spectral observations of this star .",
