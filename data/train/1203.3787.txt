    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are expected to be sources of both cosmic rays and gamma rays . while gamma rays have been observed from a number of blazars , the identification of cosmic rays with their sources",
    "is impossible ( except at the highest energies ) , because the galactic magnetic fields change their directions considerably .",
    "however , as long as the intergalactic magnetic fields are relatively small , cosmic rays produced in blazars can travel close to the line of sight and produce secondary gamma rays which would significantly contribute to the radiation observed from the direction of the point sources . for nearby blazars such contributions",
    "are expected to be small in comparison with direct gamma - ray signals reaching earth . however , for more distant blazars , the line - of - sight produced gamma rays can dominate over the direct gamma rays from the source  @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs because the primary gamma rays are filtered out in their interactions with extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , while the fraction of secondary gamma rays produced by cosmic rays in intergalactic space grows with distance traveled .",
    "based on the spectra of individual blazars  @xcite and on the trend in spectral softening  @xcite , one expects the secondary contribution to be important for redshifts @xmath4 and energies @xmath5  tev .",
    "the intrinsic gamma - ray spectra of some blazars , after correction for absorption in ebl , appear extremely hard , challenging the standard , e.g. the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) or external compton models of blazars .",
    "several solutions to this problem have been proposed .",
    "intergalactic cascading of gamma rays from blazars in the case of very weak intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) can increase the effective mean free path of gamma - rays @xcite , however , for distant blazars this effect alone appears to be insufficient to explain the gamma - ray spectra above 1  tev .",
    "the very hard spectra of primary gamma rays @xcite , or special features in the sources @xcite can help reconcile the data with theoretical predictions , at the cost of introducing some _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "hypothetical new particles  @xcite and lorentz invariance violation @xcite have been invoked to explain the data .",
    "the inclusion of cosmic - ray contribution offers an alternative solution to the problem .",
    "indeed , since a significant fraction of gamma rays in this model is produced relatively close to the observer , this model reduces dramatically the impact of gamma - ray absorption in ebl .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : z ]",
    ". protons with energy @xmath6  ev propagating through weak igmfs without strong deviations from the line of sight can carry energy from the source close to the observer and can generate a substantial gamma - ray flux at multi - tev energies .",
    "remarkably , the predicted spectra of secondary gamma rays depend only on the source redshift ( determined from independent observations ) .",
    "for each source , the power emitted in cosmic rays is the only fitting parameter which can be used to fit the data .",
    "as long as the source redshifts are known , the predictions of this model are solid and robust . the spectra calculated for the redshifts of all observed distant blazars provide a very good fit to observational data  @xcite , with a reasonable required luminosities in cosmic rays assuming that the escape of protons from the source is strongly beamed toward the observer  @xcite .",
    "secondary gamma rays produced in line - of - sight interactions of cosmic rays result in harder spectra for distant sources .",
    "since most of the observed photons are produced relatively close to the observer , there is less attenuation due to the interactions with ebl .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    confirmation of this model by future observations will have several important consequences .",
    "it will imply that ( i ) cosmic rays are , indeed , accelerated in agn , as has long been suspected , but never before confirmed by observations ; ( ii ) intergalactic magnetic fields are fairly small , of the order of several femtogauss ( @xmath7  g ) or lower  @xcite ; and ( iii ) the problem of intergalactic gamma - rays can be somewhat relaxed , and consequently the upper limits on ebl derived while neglecting the cosmic - ray contributions may need be revised . within this model , the expected temporal structure of signals from distant blazars at the highest energies should reflect the time delays cosmic rays undergo in the intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "we note that while time variability has been observed for _ nearby _ tev blazars at tev energies and for distant tev blazars at energies above a few hundred gev , no variability has been reported so far for _ distant _ tev blazars at _ tev energies_. here we call _ distant _ those blazars that have large enough redshifts for the primary tev gamma - rays to die out . based on the spectral fits  @xcite , and the spectral softening of blazars  @xcite , one concludes that most blazars with redshift @xmath8 should fall in this category . since the ratio of gamma - ray luminosity to cosmic - ray luminosity can vary from source to source , one expects a mixed population to exist at some intermediate redshifts @xmath9 , where stronger cosmic ray emitters should be observed in secondary gamma rays , while stronger gamma ray emitters should be observed in primary gamma rays . furthermore ,",
    "if stronger igmfs exist in the directions of specific sources , the secondary contribution can be suppressed .",
    "for example , pks 2155 - 304 at @xmath10 is an example of a source at an intermediate redshift from which primary signals are observed , as indicated by its tev variability  . whether the lack of tev variability is a generic feature of distant blazars , or merely an artifact of low statistics in multi - tev photons ,",
    "should be clarified in future observations .",
    "an important issue in this context is the knowledge of the spectral and temporal features of the radiation predicted by the model .",
    "the spectral features of the radiation have been studied in detail by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the extent to which the time variability at high energies should be erased by the cosmic ray propagation delays .",
    "we will focus on calculating the green s function , which corresponds to a time delay from an infinitely narrow pulse of protons at the source .",
    "realistic time profiles can be obtained by convolving the time - dependent source luminosity with this green s fucntion . however , since a fair fraction of the blazar flaring activity occurs on the time scales much sorter than those we discuss below , in many cases the green s function can be interpreted as a distribution of photon arrival times from a flaring source . in applications of our method to data analysis , one can employ time - dependent templates inferred from lower energies .",
    "there is no doubt that , for nearby blazars , the primary gamma rays produced at the source are responsible for most of the observed radiation .",
    "while these objects can also produce cosmic rays , the contribution of secondary gamma rays is not expected to dominate . however , for larger distances , the primary gamma - ray component is filtered out above a tev , while the secondary contribution is enhanced . indeed , the scaling of the primary gamma rays with distance is determined by the losses due to pair production in gamma - ray interactions with extragalactic background light ( ebl ) : @xmath11 in contrast , gamma rays generated in line - of - sight interactions of cosmic rays exhibit a very different scaling with distance  @xcite : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the distance at which ebl opacity to tev gamma rays is of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "the lack of suppression is due to the fact that the photon backgrounds ( cmb and ebl ) act as a target on which gamma rays are produced by the cosmic rays .",
    "hence , a higher column density of background photons for a more distant source boosts , not hinders the gamma - ray production .",
    "as long as igmfs are weak enough to cause only small deflections , for a sufficiently distant source , secondary gamma rays dominate because they do nt suffer from exponential suppression as in eq .",
    "( [ exponential ] ) , which is absent from eq .",
    "( [ line - of - sight ] ) .",
    "the transition from primary to secondary photons occurs when the optical depth to pair production exceeds 1 .",
    "the corresponding redshift can also be inferred from the spectral softening of the spectra  @xcite .",
    "based on these estimates , one can expect the secondary gamma rays to dominate for sources at redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "the success of the spectral fits to the data for secondary gamma rays  @xcite can be interpreted as possible evidence of cosmic ray acceleration in blazars . within this interpretation ,",
    "the beamed energy output in @xmath16  ev cosmic rays required to fit the observed spectra of distant blazars is of the order of @xmath17  erg , or @xmath18  erg isotropic equivalent @xcite , which is consistent with many models  @xcite .",
    "the luminosity required to explain ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) depends on the assumed spectrum , which is often parameterized by a broken power law with a break at some value @xmath19 ( unknown a priori ) . according to @xcite",
    ", the agn luminosities in cosmic - ray protons needed to account for the uhecr data are @xmath20  erg / s , @xmath21  erg / s , and @xmath22  erg / s , for @xmath23  ev , @xmath24  ev , and @xmath25  ev , respectively .",
    "these estimates are in general agreement with our results .",
    "we also note that , because of the selection effects , the sources observed from large distances are by no means average : they are the brightest agns , which generate exceptional power in cosmic rays .",
    "the spectra of observed gamma rays generated in this fashion depend on the intervening intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "it is easy to understand some qualitative features of this dependence in terms of a simplified random - walk description of the proton propagation .",
    "let us consider a short pulse of protons emitted from a source at distance @xmath26 . at later times ,",
    "the proton pulse broadens and takes the shape @xmath27 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath27 was computed by  @xcite and will be discussed below .",
    "( see also @xcite ; @xcite . )    at every point in its trajectory , the proton interactions with the cosmic background generate a flux of gamma rays , which quickly ( on a kpc length scale ) cascade down to energies below the threshold .",
    "from that point on , gamma rays travel without further time delays .",
    "however , during the cascade development , the igmfs cause some delays ( which are longer than the delays of the protons in the igmfs for @xmath28 below 10  tev ) .    let us consider the proton propagation in igmfs .",
    "we assume that igmfs form a lattice with correlation length @xmath29 , in which a proton with energy @xmath30 random - walks over a distance @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the angle between the proton momentum and the line of sight performs a two - dimensional random walk in small steps of @xmath33 .",
    "when the proton interacts with a background photon , it emits a narrow shower in the direction of the proton s momentum .",
    "the prompt gamma rays are emitted into a narrow angle @xmath34 for bethe ",
    "heitler pair production , or @xmath35 for pion photoproduction .",
    "the cascade develops and broadens this angle , with larger angles at lower energies . to shower in the direction of observer after @xmath36 steps of random walk ,",
    "the proton angle should return to 0 . for a 2d random walk ,",
    "the probability of _ not _ returning to zero after @xmath36 steps is @xmath37 .",
    "this probability drops below 1/2 for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , @xmath32 , and",
    "so each proton angle returns to the origin about @xmath40 time per distance traveled .",
    "therefore , the diffusion approximation is justified , and a `` typical '' delay can be computed using the distance traveled , assuming the random walk .",
    "deflection of a proton in a single cell is @xmath41 .",
    "this deflection and the time delay are determined by the larmor radius @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the proton energy in units of @xmath44  ev , and @xmath45 is the value of the magnetic field in femtogauss .",
    "therefore , @xmath46    time delay in crossing a single cell is @xmath47    after @xmath32 steps of random walk , the time delay is @xmath48    significant time delays are also incurred in the em showering process .",
    "each observed gamma ray was at some point an electron in the cascade .",
    "the time delay of each gamma ray with an observed energy @xmath28 is dominated by the delay during the lowest - energy `` electron '' phase of this gamma ray .",
    "the electron energy is related to the energy of observed ic @xmath49 ray by @xmath50 .",
    "igmfs act on the electron over a distance of the order of its cooling distance @xmath51 .",
    "the time delay incurred in this process is proportionate to the sum @xcite of @xmath52 and the mean free path to pair production @xmath53 , which has the same energy dependence ( with a much larger prefactor ) , @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting delay is @xmath55 therefore , @xmath56 where we have assumed @xmath57 .",
    "the proton delay  ( [ eqn : proton_delay_e_p ] ) is @xmath58    the total time delay of an observed photon is the sum of @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are some constants .",
    "one can , therefore , expect the following structure of time delays . the shortest delay time is determined by the delay in the arrival of the highest - energy proton ;",
    "this time delay is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : proton_delay ] ) .",
    "high - energy protons travel faster than the gamma - ray cascades , and they are followed by a tail of trailing gamma rays .",
    "there are two contributions to the total delay time , which have a different dependence on energy  ( [ eqn : total_delay ] ) . as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : total_delay ] ) diminishes with energy , the time delay approaches a plateau independent of the photon energy .",
    "the height of this plateau is determined by the energy of the proton .",
    "this agrees with the results of numerical caclculations presented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "let us consider the time delays due to the propagation of protons .",
    "protons interactions with extragalactic background radiation ( both cmb and ebl ) occur with a very low probability for energies below the pion production threshold . in the pair production process ,",
    "a proton loses only @xmath64 of its energy in each collision .",
    "thus , one can neglect the energy losses for protons in making some basic estimates .",
    "( however , in our numerical calculations , we take into account all the energy losses , including adiabatic losses . )",
    "also , the deflection angles can be assumed small for the relevant range of parameters .",
    "calculation of the electromagnetic cascade initiated by the secondary gamma rays produced in proton - photon interactions is much more difficult , and there is no simple analytical approach that could allow one to calculate the distribution function of gamma rays .",
    "therefore we will employ a hybrid approach by combining an analytical treatment of protons with a monte carlo simulation for the electromagnetic cascade .    to calculate the distribution function of protons ,",
    "let us consider a mono - energetic beam of protons emitted with energy @xmath65 at some point in time .",
    "random deflections in weak igmfs result in arrival time distribution which is convenient to consider as a function of time delay parameter @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the distance to the source and @xmath68 is the speed of light . in a small - angle approximation",

    "furthermore , the effect of the source variability would be to suppress the observed power of the source by a factor @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the typical proton delay at the source , @xmath153 is the typical time the source is active or flaring and @xmath154 is the number of times the source is active in the time period @xmath152 .",
    "this damping should not be a significant effect @xcite , especially since the typical deflections at the source are not big enough to affect the beaming factors assumed in popular models .",
    "an alternative situation is that the magnetic fields within the blazar jet are not randomly distributed , but are , instead , strongly correlated with the direction of the jet .",
    "blazar jets emit an extremely large amount of charged matter and the wind in the direction of the jet can eliminate any random - field configuration that one usually expects in a galaxy .",
    "thus , it is possible that cosmic rays escape the source along the jet with very small time delays , preserving the intrinsic variability of the source . in this case",
    ", delays in the intergalactic medium can broaden the intrinsic variability to the energy dependent timescales of these delays .    at energies where the optical depth of the observed gamma rays is below one",
    ", we expect the signal to be primary gamma rays , and any variability in this signal is indicative of the source variability .",
    "this variability should not depend strongly on the energies of the gamma rays , but rather on the scale of the structure at the source producing the gamma rays .",
    "however , we expect a very different behavior for energies at which primary gamma rays are significantly attenuated by pair production off ebl . in the case of strongly correlated magnetic fields in the jet",
    ", we expect that the variability should show different structure in the low energy component , where it should depend on the energy .",
    "the spectrum should show variability on shorter timescales for higher energies until some critical energy @xmath155 , where the timescales cease to decrease further , thanks to the domination of the cosmic ray contribution . in the case of large delays within the source",
    ", we expect all variability to be washed out at these higher energies ( typically around a tev for most observed sources ) .",
    "some exceptionally bright flares can come through around @xmath19 and rise above the _ pedestal _ created by the stochastic arrival times of protons .",
    "such flares should have distinctly softer spectra than the hard pedestal , which can be a means of distinguishing these flares from the stochastic pedestal .    for most of discussion",
    ", we have assumed that igmfs have strengths are of the order of a femtogauss .",
    "this range is suggested by the spectral fits to the data @xcite .",
    "however , field strengths well below a femtogauss can be consistent with the data as well . in the case of very weak igmfs ,",
    "the time delays become smaller , since @xmath156 . for @xmath157  g",
    ", the time delays can be as short as minutes .",
    "we have also assumed that the strength of igmf is constant on average , which is a good assumption for propagation in the voids .",
    "however , if the line of sight intersects a filament of stronger , _",
    "e.g. _ , nanogauss magnetic field , the reduction of the secondary photon signal depends on the size of the filament and on its location .",
    "thin filaments can only intercept as small fraction of protons within the 0.1 degree associated with a given source .",
    "however , a thick filament or a sheet of strong field can deflect protons , reducing the secondary signal .",
    "temporal structure of gamma - ray signals can be used to measure the igmf structure and ebl intensity in different directions , on a source - by - source basis . in addition",
    ", it may provide a way to probe the high energy cutoff of cosmic ray sources , as well as the spectrum of ebl . a statistical analysis on multiple bins of data",
    "is needed to determine the variability at different energies .",
    "this presents challenges at the highest energies because of the low statistics , but longer observation times and the advent of next generation experiments should make this analysis increasingly powerful .",

    "<S> blazars are expected to produce both gamma rays and cosmic rays . therefore , observed high - energy gamma rays from distant blazars may contain a significant contribution from secondary gamma rays produced along the line of sight by the interactions of cosmic - ray protons with background photons . unlike the standard models of blazars that consider only the primary photons emitted at the source , models which include the cosmic - ray contribution predict that even @xmath0  tev photons should be detectable from distant objects with redshifts as high as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> secondary photons contribute to signals of point sources only if the intergalactic magnetic fields are very small , @xmath2  g , and their detection can be used to set upper bounds on magnetic fields along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> secondary gamma rays have distinct spectral and temporal features . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the temporal properties of such signals using a semi - analytical formalism and detailed numerical simulations , which account for all the relevant processes , including magnetic deflections . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we elucidate the interplay of time delays coming from the proton deflections and from the electromagnetic cascade , and we find that , at multi - tev energies , secondary gamma - rays can show variability on timescales of years for @xmath3  g. </S>"
