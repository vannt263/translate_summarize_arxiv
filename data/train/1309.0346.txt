    "the cavity method developed for the study of disordered systems in statistical physics has led in the recent years to the design of a family of algorithmic techniques for combinatorial optimization known as message - passing algorithms ( mpa ) . in spite of the numerical evidence of great potentialities of these techniques in terms of efficiency and quality of results for many optimization problems ,",
    "their use in real - world problems has still to be fully expressed . the main reasons for this reside in the fact that the derivation of the equations underlying the algorithms are in many cases non - trivial and that the rigorous and numerical analyses of the cavity equations are still largely incomplete . both rigorous results and benchmarking would play an important role in helping the process of integrating mpas with the existing techniques .    in what follows we focus on a very well known np - hard optimization problem over networks , the so - called prize collecting steiner tree problem on graphs ( pcst ) .",
    "the pcst problem can be stated in general terms as the problem of finding a connected subgraph of minimum cost .",
    "it has applications in many areas ranging from biology , e.g. finding protein associations in cell signaling @xcite , to network technologies , e.g. finding optimal ways to deploy fiber optic and heating networks for households and industries @xcite .",
    "though the cavity equations have been developed for the study of mean field models for disordered systems , the range of their applicability is known to go beyond these problems .    in this paper",
    "we show how msgsteiner  an algorithm derived from the zero temperature cavity equations @xcite  compares with state - of - the - art techniques on benchmarks problem instances .",
    "specifically , we provide comparison results with an enhanced derivative of the goemans - williamson heuristics ( mgw ) @xcite and with the dhea solver @xcite , a branch and cut linear / integer programming based approach .",
    "we made the comparison both on random networks and in known benchmarks .",
    "we show that msgsteiner typically outperforms the state - of - the - art algorithms in the largest instances of the pcst problem both in the values of the optimum and in running time .",
    "finally , we show how some aspects of the solutions can be provably characterized .",
    "specifically we show some optimality properties of the fixed points of the cavity equations , including optimality under the two post - processing procedures defined in mgw ( namely _ strong pruning _ and _ minimum spanning tree _ ) and global optimality of the mpa solution in some limit cases .",
    "the method and the algorithm described here are a generalization of the technique presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the algorithm is tested on different families of random graphs for the more specific case of bounded depth ( @xmath0 ) steiner tree problem , which can be recovered from the pcst problem by sending to infinity the weights of the so - called terminal nodes . in the cases of erdos - renyi random graphs and for scale - free graphs the numerical performance of the algorithm",
    "have been shown to be extremely good though there exits no rigorous results to compare with .",
    "interestingly enough the case of complete graphs with random weights allows for a comparison with rigorous asymptotic results .",
    "the scaling coefficients of the power law for the average minimum cost and number of steiner nodes as a function of the size @xmath1 of the graph was calculated exactly in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was also rigorously established that the critical depth for the bounded - depth minimum spanning tree and steiner tree on random complete graphs is @xmath2 .",
    "extensive numerical studies up top @xmath3 which for brevity we do not report in detail , show that the cavity approach provides solutions which have a minimum cost that is below that of the greedy algorithm analyzed in @xcite and that there is slow convergence to the exact scaling parameters .",
    "this fact corroborates the conjecture that the cavity approach could be asymptotically exact and reproduce the results of @xcite . while this is not totally unexpected for statistical physics of random systems ( the cavity approach is known to be very accurate on mean - field problems defined over complete graphs ) , it is important for the rigorous foundation of the cavity method itself .",
    "there exist in fact very few model problems on which the zero temperature cavity approach can be proven to be exact , one famous example being the matching problem @xcite .",
    "np - complete problems ( considered in their typical realizations ) are particularly elusive in this respect , possibly due to the local nature of the cavity algorithms .",
    "therefore , having at hand a non - trivial problem which can be analyzed rigorously as in @xcite constitutes an interesting case also for the rigorous understanding of the cavity method .",
    "in the following we will describe the prize - collecting steiner tree problem on graphs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given a network @xmath4 with positive ( real ) weights @xmath5 on edges and @xmath6 on vertices , consider the problem of finding the connected sub - graph @xmath7 that minimizes @xmath8 , i.e. to compute the minimum : @xmath9    it can be easily seen that a minimizing sub - graph must be a tree ( links closing cycles can be removed , lowering @xmath10 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 regulates the tradeoff between the edge costs and vertices prizes , and its value has the effect to determine the size of the subgraph @xmath12 : for @xmath13 the empty subgraph is optimal , whereas for @xmath11 large enough the optimal subgraph includes all nodes .",
    "this problem is known to be np - hard , implying that no polynomial algorithm exists that can solve any instance of the problem unless @xmath14 . to solve it",
    "we will use a variation of a very efficient heuristics based on belief propagation developed on @xcite that is known to be exact on some limit cases @xcite .",
    "we will partially extend the results in @xcite to a more general pcst setting .",
    "we will deal with a variant of the pcst called @xmath0-bounded rooted pcst ( @xmath0-pcst ) .",
    "this problem is defined by a graph @xmath15 , an edge cost matrix @xmath16 and prize vector @xmath17 along with a selected `` root '' node @xmath18 .",
    "the goal is to find the @xmath18-rooted tree with maximum depth @xmath0 of minimum cost , where the cost is defined as in ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "a general pcst can be reduced to @xmath0-bounded rooted pcst by setting @xmath19 and probing with all possible rootings , slowing the computation by a factor @xmath20 ( we will see later a more efficient way of doing it ) . a second variant which we will consider is the so - called @xmath21 multi - rooted @xmath0-bounded prize collecting steiner forest ( @xmath22-pcsf ) .",
    "it consists of is a natural generalization of the previous problem : a subset @xmath21 of `` root '' vertices is selected , and the scope is to find a forest of trees of minimum cost , each one rooted in one of the preselected root nodes in @xmath21 .",
    "the cavity formalism can be adopted and made efficient if the global constraints which may be present in the problem can be written in terms of local constraints . in the pcst case",
    "the global constraint is connectivity which can be made local as follows .",
    "we start with the graph @xmath23 and a selected _ root _ node @xmath24 . to each vertex @xmath25",
    "there is an associated couple of variables @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 denotes the set of neighbors of @xmath29 in @xmath15 and @xmath30 .",
    "variable @xmath31 has the meaning of the parent of @xmath29 in the tree ( the special value @xmath32 means that @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 is the auxiliary variable describing its distance to the root node ( i.e. the _ depth _ of @xmath29 ) . to correctly describe a tree , variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 should satisfy a number of constrains , ensuring that depth decreases along the tree in direction to the root , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "additionally , nodes that do not participate to the tree ( @xmath32 ) should not be parent of some other node , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "note that even though @xmath34 variables are redundant ( in the sense that they can be easily computed from @xmath39 ones ) , they are crucial to maintain the locality of the constraints . for",
    "every ordered couple @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , we define @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 is the kroenecker delta ) . the condition of the subgraph to be a tree can be ensured by imposing that @xmath44 has to be equal to one for each edge @xmath45 .",
    "if we extend the definition of @xmath46 by @xmath47 , then ( except for an irrelevant constant additive term ) , the minimum in ( [ eq : h ] ) equals to : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52    this new expression for the energy accounts for the sum of taken edge costs plus the sum of uncollected prizes and has the advantage of being non - negative .",
    "the algorithmic scheme we propose originates from the cavity method of statistical physics , a technique which is known in other fields under different names , namely cavity equations , belief propagation ( bp ) , max - sum or sum - product equations ( ms ) . from a numerical point of view",
    ", message - passing algorithms are distributed algorithm which allow for a very fast resolution of inference and optimization problems @xcite , even for large networks .",
    "a recent review can be found in @xcite .",
    "the starting point for the equations is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is a positive parameter ( called inverse temperature ) , and @xmath56 is a normalization constant ( called partition function ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath57 this probability concentrates on the configurations which minimize @xmath58 .",
    "the bp approximation consists in a weak correlation assumption between certain probability distributions of single @xmath59 pairs called `` cavity marginals '' .",
    "given @xmath60 , the cavity marginal @xmath61 is defined as the marginal distribution @xmath62 on a graph @xmath63 from which node @xmath29 has been temporally removed .",
    "the bp equations are derived by assuming that the cavity marginals are uncorrelated and as such satisfy the following closed set of equations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a general discussion ) :    @xmath64        this assumption is correct if @xmath15 is a tree , in which case ( [ eq : phat])-([eq : bp ] ) are exact and have a unique solution . equations ( [ eq : phat])-([eq : bp ] ) can be seen as fixed point equations , and solutions are normally searched through iteration : substituting onto [ eq : phat ] and giving a time index @xmath65 and @xmath66 to the cavity marginals in respectively the left and right hand side of the resulting equation , this system is iterated until numerical convergence is reached .",
    "cavity marginals are often called `` messages '' because they can be thought of as bits of information that flow between edges of the graph during time in this iteration . on a fixed point ,",
    "the bp approximation to the marginal is computed as @xmath67      in order to take the @xmath57 limit , ( [ eq : bp ] ) can be rewritten in terms of `` cavity fields '' @xmath68 the bp equations take the so - called ms form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an additive constant chosen to ensure @xmath71    computing the right side of ( [ eq : max - sum ] ) is in general too costly in computational terms .",
    "fortunately , the computation can be carried out efficiently by breaking up the set over which the max is computed into smaller ( possibly overlapping ) subsets .",
    "we define @xmath72    equation ( [ eq : max - sum ] ) can now be rewritten as : @xmath73    using some simple efficiency tricks including computing @xmath74 as @xmath75 , the computation of the right side of ( [ eq : afp])-([eq : efp ] ) for all @xmath76 can be done in a time proportional to @xmath77 , where @xmath0 is the depth bound .",
    "the overall computation time is then @xmath78 per iteration .      in order to identify the minimum cost configurations , we need to compute the total marginals , i.e. the marginals in the case in which no node has been removed from the graph . given cavity fields ,",
    "the total fields @xmath79 can be written as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is again an additive constant that ensures @xmath82 . in terms of the above quantities we find @xmath83 if @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the total fields can be interpreted as ( the max - sum approximation to ) the relative negative energy loss of chosing a given configuration for variables @xmath86 instead of their optimal choice , i.e. @xmath87 . in particular , in absence of degeneracy , the maximum of the field is attained for values of @xmath88 corresponding to the optimal energy .",
    "equations ( [ eq : afp])-([eq : efp ] ) can be thought as a fixed - point equation in a high dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this equation could be solved by repeated iteration of the quantities @xmath89,@xmath90 , and @xmath91 starting from an arbitrary initial condition , simply by adding an index @xmath92 to @xmath93 in the left - hand side of ( [ eq : max - sum ] ) and index @xmath94 to all other instances of @xmath95 .",
    "this system converges in many cases .",
    "when it does not converge , a technique called _ reinforcement _ is of help @xcite .",
    "the idea is to perturbate the right side of ( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : marginal ] ) by adding the term @xmath96 for a ( generally small ) scalar factor @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting equations become :    @xmath98    in our experiments , the equations converge for a sufficiently large @xmath99 .",
    "the strategy we adopted is , when the equations do not converge , to start with @xmath100 and slowly increase it until convergence in a linear regime @xmath101 ( although other regimes are possible ) . the number of iterations is then found to be inversely dependent on the parameter @xmath102 . this strategy could be interpreted as using time - averages of the ms marginals when the equations do not converge to gradually bootstrap the system into an ( easier to solve ) system with sufficiently large external fields",
    ". a c++ implementation of these equations can be found ( in source form ) on @xcite .",
    "note that the cost matrix @xmath103 need not to be symmetric , and the same scheme could be used for directed graphs ( using @xmath104 if @xmath105 but @xmath106 ) .      the pcst formulation given in the introduction is unrooted .",
    "the ms equations on the other hand , need a predefined root .",
    "one way of reducing the unrooted problem to a rooted problem is to solve @xmath107 different problems with all possible different rooting , and choose the one of minimum cost .",
    "this unfortunately adds a factor @xmath1 to the time complexity .",
    "note that in the particular case in which some vertex has a large enough prize to be necessarily included in an optimal solution ( e.g. @xmath108 ) , this node can simply be chosen as as root .",
    "we have devised a more efficient method for choosing the root in the general case , which we will now describe .",
    "add an extra new node @xmath18 to the graph , connected to every other node with identical edge cost @xmath109 . if @xmath109 is sufficiently large , the best energy solution is the ( trivial ) tree consisting in just the node @xmath18 .",
    "fortunately , a solution of the ms equations on this graph gives additional information : for each node @xmath110 in the original graph , the marginal field @xmath111 gives the relative energy shift of selecting a given parent ( and then adjusting all other variables in the best possible configuration ) .",
    "now for each @xmath110 , consider the positive real value @xmath112 , that corresponds with the best attainable energy , constrained to the condition that @xmath18 is the parent of @xmath110 . if @xmath109 is large enough , this energy is the energy of a tree in which only @xmath110 ( and no other node ) is connected to @xmath18 ( as each of these connections costs @xmath109 ) .",
    "but these trees are in one to one correspondence with trees rooted at @xmath110 in the original graph .",
    "the smallest @xmath113 will thus identify an optimal rooting .",
    "unfortunately the information carried by these fields is not sufficient to build the optimal tree .",
    "therefore one needs to select the best root @xmath110 and run the ms equations a second time on the original graph using this choice .",
    "we compared the performance of msgsteiner with the three different algorithms : two that employ an integer linear programming strategy to find an optimal subtree , namely the lagrangian non delayed relax and cut ( lndrc ) @xcite and branch - and - cut ( dhea ) @xcite , and modified version of the goemans and williamson algorithm ( mgw)@xcite .",
    "the goal of the integer linear programming ( ilp ) is to find an integer solution vector @xmath114 such that : @xmath115 where a matrix @xmath116 and vector @xmath117 and @xmath118 are given .",
    "many graph problems can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem @xcite . in general , solving ( [ eq : ilp ] ) with @xmath119 is np - complete .",
    "the standard approach consists in solving ( [ eq : ilp ] ) for @xmath120 ( a relaxation of the original problem ) and use the solution as a guide for some heuristics or complete algorithm for the integer case .",
    "the relaxed problem can be solved by many classical algorithms , like the simplex method @xcite or interior point methods . in order to map the pcst problem in a ilp problem",
    "we introduce a variable vector @xmath121 and @xmath122 where the component for an edge in @xmath123 or for a vertex in @xmath124 is one if and only if it is included in the solution , zero otherwise . now",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) can be written as @xmath125 and the constraints @xmath126 in ( [ eq : ilp ] ) generally involve all the variable @xmath127 and @xmath128 and describe the problem .",
    "for the pcst , and in general for hard problems , the number of constraints grows exponentially with the problem size@xcite .",
    "dhea and lnrdc use different techniques to tackle the problems of enormous number of constraints .",
    "both programs are able in principle to prove the optimality of solution , and when is not the case they are able to give a lower bound for the value of the optimum .",
    "the mgw algorithm is based on the primal - dual method for approximation algorithms @xcite .",
    "the starting point is still the ilp formulation of the problem ( [ eq : ilp ] ) , but it employs a controlled approximation scheme that enforces the cost of any solution to be at most twice as large as the optimum one . in addition , mgw implements two different post - processing strategies , namely a pruning scheme that is able to eliminate some nodes while lowering the cost , and the computation of the minimum spanning tree in order to find an optimal rewiring of the same set of nodes .",
