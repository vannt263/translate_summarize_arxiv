    "the radio emission from star - forming galaxies is of great importance as an apparently unbiased tracer of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , being neither obscured nor enhanced by the presence of dust ( e.g. condon 1992 ) . at sub - millijansky fluxes , deep radio surveys detect large number of star - forming galaxies , which overtake radio galaxies and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as the most numerous type of source .",
    "hence a deep radio - selected source sample will efficiently select the most intensely star - forming galaxies in the survey volume",
    ".    hammer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) investigated the optical ids of a sample of radio sources detected in a deep very large array ( vla ) survey of one of the canada - france redshift survey fields , to a limit in integrated flux @xmath8 .",
    "spectroscopy revealed these galaxies to be mixture of ( i ) giant ellipticals , presumably with agn , ( ii ) star - forming disks at redshifts out to @xmath9 , and ( iii ) lower redshift , high - excitation emission - line galaxies .",
    "windhorst et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and richards et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtained similar findings  although with fewer agn and more disk galaxies  at even fainter flux limits . using hst imaging",
    ", they estimated that at least @xmath10 per cent of the radio - selected galaxies were interacting .    in a previous paper ( roche , lowenthal and koo 2002 ; hereafter rlk02 ) we identified the most probable optical ids for 50 out of 51 @xmath11900 @xmath12 sources , detected in three deep vla surveys .",
    "these galaxies were imaged in @xmath13 using the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) , and in @xmath14 with the near infra - red camera ( nirc ) .",
    "spectra and redshifts were obtained for 17 , using lris in spectroscopic mode . of these ,",
    "14 were found to be emission - line galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath15 , and the other 3 were qsos at @xmath16 . a further 9 of the radio i d galaxies had known redshifts from previous observations , giving a total of 26 with known redshifts .",
    "rlk02 concluded that more than half of these 26 were disk galaxies with enhanced radio luminosities , resulting from major starbursts ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the remainder were apparently normal , non - starburst spirals and ellipticals at lower redshifts ( @xmath18 ) ( @xmath19 per cent ) , qsos ( @xmath20 per cent ) , or giant radioluminous ellipticals suspected to contain obscured agn ( @xmath21 per cent ) .",
    "the lris spectra of the 14 non - qso galaxies showed the expected emission lines , @xmath223727\\aa$ ] , @xmath23 and @xmath245007\\aa$ ] , but the line luminosities typically correspond to sfrs an order of magnitude lower than the radio luminosities imply .",
    "other surveys of radio - selected galaxies have found a similar discrepancy between emission - line and radio fluxes ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "1996 ; beck , turner and kovo 2000 ; serjeant et al .",
    "the simplest explanation is a high dust extinction ( @xmath253 mag ) of the starburst regions .",
    "we also found that 11 of the 26 galaxies were in close pairs and several others looked disturbed .",
    "however , it was clear that to adequately investigate the interaction status of these galaxies , much higher resolution imaging , e.g wfpc2 , would be required .",
    "serjeant et al . ( 2000 ) performed an wfpc2 imaging survey of radio - selected star - forming galaxies , and describe the first four .",
    "these galaxies are at lower redshifts , @xmath26 , than the rlk02 sample but have comparable radio luminosites .",
    "they found at least one galaxy to be interacting and all 4 to be disturbed to some degree , and quantified morphological disturbance in terms of a rotational asymmetry parameter @xmath27 ( conselice , bershady and jangren 2000 ) .",
    "they concluded that radio - selected galaxies are generally more asymmetric than optically - selected galaxies at similar magnitudes .",
    "similarly , and at higher redshifts , fomalont et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified 37/63 faint @xmath28 radio sources with @xmath29 galaxies , and using wfpc2 imaging found a high proportion , 46 per cent , to be multiple or interacting .",
    "in this paper we perform a similar wfpc2 study of a subsample of the rlk02 radio ids .",
    "our hst program was allocated a total of 24 orbits , which was devoted to wfpc2 @xmath0-band imaging of four fields , containing a total of 9 of the rlk02 galaxies .",
    "for the first two fields we imaged in parallel with stis , and obtained images in the broad stis @xmath2-band of two of the galaxies .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 catalogs the observed galaxies and presents hst images . in section 4 , radial intensity profiles are presented , model profiles fitted , and surface brightness compared with local galaxies . in section 5 the evidence for interactions is investigated .",
    "asymmetry parameters are evaluated and model profiles subtracted from the galaxies to highlight ` residual ' features . in section 6 , galaxy colours are interpreted .",
    "section 7 is a discussion of the nature of these galaxies and the source of their radio luminosity .",
    "the galaxies studied here are an unbiased subsample of the galaxies identified by rlk02 on keck lris images as probable optical counterparts of the radio detections on two vla surveys .",
    "the first survey is of the sa68 field , centred at r.a . @xmath30",
    "dec 14:55:00 ( equinox 2000.0 used throughout ) , in which observations at 5.0 ghz detected sources to integrated flux limits of @xmath31 , or @xmath32@xmath33 at 8.44 ghz ( weistrop et al .",
    "the wfpc2 field of view covers only one of these sources at a time .",
    "the second survey , smaller in area but much deeper , is of the ` lynx2 ' or ` 16v ' field ( r.a . @xmath34",
    "dec 44:34:05 ) , observed at 8.44 ghz for 63 hours in december 1989 and january 1990 .",
    "this gave a noise level of @xmath35 and a point - source completeness limit at @xmath36  windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) catalog the detections .",
    "a wfpc2 field may include several of these fainter sources .",
    "the hst observations , in 14 time slots from september 2000 to september 2001 , consisted of two pointings within the sa68 vla survey ( weistrop et al .",
    "1987 ) and two in the lynx2/16v ( windhorst et .",
    "al 1993 ) field .",
    "our program originally called for observations with both wfpc2 and stis , but the temporary failure of stis partway through our observations meant that we used only wfpc2 for the targets in the lynx2 field .",
    "imaging was performed in four telescope pointings as described below .",
    "\\(i ) the optical i d for the radio source sa68:10 ( hereafter ` s10 ' ) was centered in the wfpc2 and imaged in the @xmath0-band ( f814w ) for 5 orbits , giving 10 exposures of 1200s or 1300s for a total of 12.4 ksec .",
    "each orbit was split into two exposures for cosmic - ray rejection , and the telescope was dithered a few arcseconds between successive orbits to improve flat - fielding and bad pixel rejection .",
    "stis , operating in parallel , simultaneously imaged another galaxy from the same survey , sa68:4 ( hereafter ` s4 ' ) , for 5 exposures of 400 sec each totalling 2000 sec in a wide @xmath2-band filter ( mirvis ) .",
    "for the remainder of the available time at that pointing , stis was used in spectroscopic mode , but the resulting spectra were of poor signal - to - noise and will not be discussed here further .",
    "\\(ii ) the telescope was rotated 180 degrees at the same pointing as in ( i ) to switch instruments , so that the wfpc2 was centered on s4 and stis on s10 .",
    "again we obtained 10 exposures totalling 12.4 ksec in f814w with wfpc2 and 5 imaging exposures totalling 2.0 ksec in stis .",
    "\\(iii ) the lynx2 survey source 16v31 was centered in the wfpc2 and observed in the @xmath0-band for 7 orbits , giving 14 exposures totalling 17.4 ksec .",
    "\\(iv ) as ( iii ) but centered on 16v22 .",
    "the observed area of the 16v31 pointing also included the sources 16v25 , 16v30 and 16v34 .",
    "the 16v22 pointing overlapped slightly with the third and again included 16v25 , together with 16v21 and 16v26 .",
    "hence in total we observe 9 radio - selected galaxies .",
    "the data were downloaded from the stsci archive already flat - fielded and calibrated , and further reduction was performed using iraf , as described in more detail by roche , lowenthal and woodgate ( 2000 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 has 4 chips ( c1c4 ) , each @xmath37 pixels , with a pixelsize 0.046 arcsec on c1 ( the pc ) and 0.0966 arcsec on c2c4 .",
    "the stis ccd produces a single @xmath38 pixel image , pixelsize 0.05077 arcsec .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from wfpc2 data using either the ` nukecr ' routine developed by luc simard or ` bclean ' on starlink figaro , and cosmic ray pixels were flagged on the data quality file .",
    "the stis data were supplied with cosmic rays already rejected and flagged .",
    "the exposures had been spatially dithered with offsets of up to a few arcsec between each orbit .",
    "offsets were measured using the iraf routines ` precor ' , ` crossdriz ' and  shiftfind  .",
    "the wfpc2 and stis exposures ( together with their data quality files ) were rebinned to a finer @xmath39 grid , using iraf ` drizzle ' , and positionally registered using the measured offsets ( rebinning scale factors were 0.42 for wfpc2 chips 24 , 0.45 for c1 and 0.53 for stis ) .",
    "the drizzled exposures were then stacked using iraf ` imcombine ' , with rejection of those pixels discrepant by @xmath40 and those flagged as ` bad pixels ' or as cosmic rays . finally the stacked exposures were trimmed to remove the low - quality edges .",
    "sources were detected on the drizzled and stacked images using sextractor ( bertin and arnauts 1996 ) , with a detection threshold of @xmath41 in a minimum area of 16 rebinned pixels for wfpc2 c2c4 , 36 for c1 , and 25 for stis . over 200 galaxies",
    "are detected on each large wfpc2 chip .",
    "sextractor provides ` total ' ( kron - type ) magnitudes , derived by fitting a series of elliptical apertures to each detection .",
    "we have found that these ` total ' magnitudes are usually reliable for wfpc2 data ( they agree closely with the magnitudes from stis ` isophote.ellipse ' at the largest radii ) , and hence we adopt these here as the true @xmath42 magnitudes .    magnitudes are given throughout in the ab system , in which , in any passband , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is flux in ergs @xmath45 .",
    "the stacked images are normalized to the mean exposure time ( 1240 sec for the wfpc2 sa68 fields , 1243 sec for the wfpc2 lynx2 fields , and 400 sec for stis ) , and photometric zero - points derived as @xmath46 where ` photflam ' is as given in the exposure headers , @xmath47 for f814w and @xmath48 for stis @xmath2 ) , and @xmath49 is the galactic extinction ( from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) .",
    "the @xmath50 thresholds are approximately 24.7 ( sa68 ) or 25.0(lynx2 ) @xmath0 mag @xmath51 for wfpc2 and 24.2 @xmath2 mag @xmath51 for stis imaging .",
    "all 9 of the radio - selected galaxies in the observed region are detected .",
    ".radio - selected galaxies observed with wfpc2/stis ; positions ( j2000 ) , hst @xmath0 magnitudes ( errors @xmath52 mag ) , ground - based @xmath53 colours from rlk02 ( errors @xmath540.3 ) , redshifts ( rlk02 ) , integrated 8.44 ghz fluxes , estimated luminosities in the restframe 8.44 ghz ( rlk02 ) and the corresponding sfrs , with the lower and upper values corresponding to the @xmath55-sfr relations of carilli ( 2001 ) and condon ( 1992 ) .",
    "these sfrs also assume that all radio emission is due to star formation and do not apply if there is a large agn contribution .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 4 shows @xmath27 against redshift for our sample and that of serjeant et al .",
    "the mean @xmath27 ( 0.23 ) of our sample , the dispersion ( 0.11 ) and the range are all similar to those of the radio - selected galaxies at @xmath56 .",
    "although even non - interacting irregular galaxies ( e.g. ngc4449 on figure 7 of conselice et al . 2000 ) may have asymmetries of up to @xmath57 , these are atypical and most galaxies in optically - selected samples ( e.g. the cfrs / ldss galaxies on figure 2 of sergeant et al .",
    "2000 ) are clustered around lower values of @xmath58 .",
    "the results for our sample , combined with the @xmath26 galaxies , are therefore evidence that radio - selected galaxies are on average more dynamically disturbed than optically - selected galaxies .",
    "futhermore , we see that although some of these radio - selected galaxies appear normal and have @xmath59 , an even higher proportion ( 5 of the 13 plotted ) have the @xmath60 asymmetries characteristic of ongoing or very recent merging , or other major dynamical disruption .",
    "star - forming regions and asymmetric effects of dynamic disturbance can be highlighted by subtracting the underlying disk or bulge profile from galaxy images , to leave an image of the residuals .",
    "using iraf ` mkobjects ' , we generate for each galaxy a 2d image of a symmetrical disk or bulge model profile , with the same scalelength ( from the fitted profile as shown on figure 2 ) , and same ellipticity and position angles ( as given by sextractor ) .",
    "these model profiles are subtracted from the observed galaxies and subtracted , leaving the residuals ( figure 5 ) , which are briefly described below .    -4.0 cm    s4 : residual image shows part of the nucleus ( incompletely subtracted due to its isophotal twist ) and whole of the companion galaxy .",
    "s10 : bright knots extending w of the nucleus on the n and s edges of the galaxy .",
    "16v21 : bright knots and the possible companion galaxy and connecting filament .",
    "16v22 : shows a faint ring resulting from the outer isophotes being rounder than the bar - like inner region .",
    "16v25 : bright residuals consisting of the bar and arms .",
    "the bar is asymmetric , almost triangular .",
    "16v26 : multiple bright regions .",
    "16v30 : shows part of the slightly off - centre nucleus , a spur extending to the n , and a large bright ring with a full circle visible .",
    "16v31 : shows part of the slightly off - centre nucleus , and a large bright ring , broken ( obscured by internal extinction ? ) on one side , there is an additional bright region to the n of the nucleus and within the ring , which on close inspection is seen to lie on a thinner and fainter inner ring .",
    "16v34 : a very bright ring of variable sb , appearing broken , and an extended bright region s of the ring .",
    "the most significant new findings from this method are ( i ) asymmetry and possible disturbance in the centre of 16v25 , and ( ii ) rings in three galaxies . these rings are discussed in detail below .",
    "the ` cartwheel ' galaxy ( a0035 ) , first described by fosbury and hawarden ( 1977 ) , is a luminous @xmath61 ) late - type disk at @xmath62 , with a large and very prominent 33 @xmath63 kpc radius ring . the ring is now known to have been formed by the high - velocity passage of a small companion galaxy through the disk , near the centre , triggering an expanding density wave with a radial velocity @xmath64 km @xmath65 ( higdon 1996 ) .",
    "there is also a much fainter inner ring of radius 7 @xmath63 .",
    "appleton and marston ( 1997 ) describe 10 other galaxies of this type with a wide range of ring radii .",
    "collisional ring galaxies are remarkable , in that the high - velocity impact of a much less massive galaxy can generate a very prolonged starburst which eventually sweeps through the whole disk , converting most of the gas to stars . despite the cartwheel s",
    "@xmath5 gyr post - impact age ( radius / velocity ) , the sfr remains extremely high with almost all the star formation concentrated in bright knots on the outer ring .",
    "higdon ( 1995 , 1996 ) , on the basis of balmer line and radio/@xmath67 ratios , estimate a high extinction of @xmath25 mag for these star - forming regions , and after correcting @xmath68 for this estimate a sfr of 268 @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "at this sfr the cartwheel will exhaust its supply of gas in a further @xmath71 gyr .",
    "our wfpc2 sample contains 3 galaxies with rings suggestive of similar collision histories .",
    "16v31 has the closest resemblance to the cartwheel in that a nucleus , inner and outer rings are all visible , and its radio luminosity and sfr are very similar .",
    "16v34 differs in that only one ring is visible , the ring is more off - centre and asymmetric ( appearing broken ) , and no nucleus is visible .",
    "it may simply be that 16v34 is a later - type spiral than 16v31 , and that the colliding dwarf galaxy impacted further from the centre and at a greater inclination to the disk plane .",
    "16v30 , on the other hand , is an earlier - type galaxy with a very bright bulge - profile nucleus .",
    "the residual image shows a luminous spur extending n from the nucleus .",
    "figure 6 shows cross - sections along the major axes of these three galaxies , with the fitted disk and bulge profiles subtracted ( as on figure 2 ) .",
    "ring radii are measured from the peaks in these cross - sections .",
    "on 16v30 ( redshift unknown ) , the ring ( peak @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) has radius 1.51 arcsec and is off - centre from the nucleus by 0.17 arcsec .",
    "on 16v31 the outer ring ( peak @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) has radius 1.17 arcsec ( 10.0 @xmath63 kpc or 1.63 @xmath74 ) and is off - centre by 0.17 arcsec , and the inner ring ( peak @xmath75 to @xmath76 has a radius 0.67 arcsec ( 5.7 @xmath63 kpc or 0.93 @xmath74 ) and is off - centre by 0.13 arcsec .",
    "on 16v34 the ring ( peak @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) has radius 0.90 arcsec ( 7.0 @xmath63 kpc or 0.71 @xmath74 ) and is more off - centre , by 0.25 arcsec , while the secondary peak b is 0.70 arcsec beyond the a ring .",
    "if the ring expansion velocities are similar to the cartwheel , the post - impact ages of 16v31 and 16v34 would be 184 @xmath63 and 130 @xmath63 myr , which are typical for galaxies with visible collisional rings ( bransford et al .",
    "16v31 , with two rings , appears to be at a similar evolutionary stage to the cartwheel , but 16v34 may be at an earlier stage , as there is only one ring and it is considerably smaller than the visible extent of the galaxy disk . if , for example , the starburst does not run out of fuel until the ring reaches @xmath77 , 16v34 will be a bright radio source for a further 0.20.3 gyr .    .",
    "combining wfpc2 data with the stis data for s4 and s10 provided @xmath78 colours , which although narrow - based , may still be useful in distinguishing young and old stellar populations , especially at @xmath79 .",
    "the whole - galaxy colours , as measured in large elliptical apertures fitted to @xmath0-band isophotes ( including almost all of the flux , and matched in the two passbands ) , are @xmath80 for s4 and @xmath81 for s10 .",
    "the colour of the small companion of s4 was measured in a 0.5 arcsec radius aperture as @xmath82 .",
    "using the ` pegase 2 ' package of fioc and rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) , we model the @xmath78 colours expected for the evolving galaxy models considered in rlk02 .",
    "the e and s0 models differ in the initial starburst duration , but both evolve passively at @xmath83 .",
    "the spiral and irr models have sfrs decreasing approximately exponentially and include dust .",
    "we also model a non - evolving 50 myr age pure starburst , with and without dust .",
    "figure 8 shows these models together with the whole - galaxy colours of s4 and s10 , and also the colour of the companion galaxy to s4 , measured in a 0.5 arcsec radius aperture as @xmath82 .",
    "s4 has the red colour of a passive galaxy with no indication of ongoing star - formation , while its disk - type companion and s10 are both much bluer and consistent with evolving spirals .    using iraf ` geomap '",
    ", the stis images could be rebinned to the pixel grid of the wfpc2 data .",
    "colour profiles were then extracted , by using ` isophote ' to measure stis fluxes on the isophotes already fitted to the @xmath0 images , and are shown on figure 7 .",
    "s10 is significantly non - uniform in colour , with a relatively red centre , @xmath84 , which is closer to a passive than a spiral model . at @xmath85 arcsec",
    "there is a sudden transition to much bluer colours of @xmath860.9 , consistent with an evolving spiral or a moderately reddened ( @xmath87 mag ) starburst .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy was initially a normal star - forming spiral , with a nucleus containing older stellar population in its nucleus .",
    "this appears to have been greatly disrupted by an interaction , triggering extensive starbursting with associated radio and @xmath223727 $ ] emission .",
    "however , the disk colour remains consistent with a non - starburst spiral , so the burst may be moderately  @xmath88 mag  dust - reddened .",
    "s4 , in contrast , is uniformly red , with passive - evolution colours , out to @xmath89 arcsec .",
    "the bluer colour at @xmath90 arcsec is due at least in part to the much bluer companion galaxy .",
    "however , there is evidence of slight ( @xmath7 mag ) bluening at @xmath91 arcsec , where the radial profile does not indicate any additional flux from the companion , so there may be a small colour gradient in its outer regions .",
    "s4 , the most radioluminous , is a giant elliptical , with a much fainter blue disk companion .",
    "the colours and sb are consistent with a passively evolving elliptical and there are no obvious star - forming regions .",
    "we find no indication that it is undergoing the extreme star formation  at least @xmath92 @xmath70  needed for this to account for its radio luminosity .",
    "the radio emission is probably from an obscured agn , and it seems plausible that the interaction with the companion triggered the current nuclear activity .",
    "s10 , the second most radioluminous , is a very different object , blue in colour with a very asymmetric disk profile .",
    "the bright knots , high optical sb and strong emission lines are evidence for an extensive starburst .",
    "it has a much redder nucleus , suggesting it was initially a spiral .",
    "interaction - triggered star - formation can probably account for the high radio luminosity .",
    "16v22 is a sub-@xmath93 galaxy of estimated type @xmath94 .",
    "the sb is near average for a disk of its redshift , and is not visibly interacting or disturbed . however , very blue colours , strong @xmath245007 \\aa$ ] emission , and a high excitation ratio , @xmath95})/f({\\rm h\\beta})=2.93\\pm 0.14 $ ] ( rlk02 ) imply starbursting , or possibly an agn .",
    "the deep radio sample of hammer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) contained some similar high - excitation , sub-@xmath93 galaxies , which were of uncertain nature having line diagnostics near the hii / seyfert / liner divide . in the case of 16v22",
    ", we find no sign of a central point source on our image , so it seems most likely that star - formation accounts for the radio emission .",
    "16v25 appears to be a barred @xmath96 spiral , with a high disk and central sb .",
    "the radio emission may be due to strong star - formation , possibly enhanced by a minor interaction as the central bar appears asymmetric .",
    "it is also possible that some of the emission is from an agn , but any active nucleus must be heavily obscured as there is no visible point - source ( the redshift was too high for rlk02 to obtain an excitation ratio ) .",
    "16v30 could be ( i ) a very early - type spiral with radio emission from a collisional starburst ring , or ( ii ) a giant elliptical that has accreted a smaller galaxy , forming a ring .",
    "of these 9 galaxies , it is the second brightest in @xmath0 but has the lowest radio flux .",
    "the redshift is unknown but if the optical luminosity is high ( @xmath97 ) the radio emission would be consistent with a normal giant elliptical , following the sadler , jenkins and kotanyi ( 1989 ) relation .",
    "16v31 and 16v34 are disks with rings resembling those in the cartwheel galaxy , and on the basis of the high sfr and radio flux of the original cartwheel , it is highly probable that collisional starbursting in these rings accounts for their radio luminosities .",
    "our hst imaging survey confirms the high incidence of interactions amongst faint radio - selected galaxies , as previously reported by e.g. windhorst et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and serjeant .",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , with the strong radio emission resulting from starbursting in the majority of galaxies ( at least 6 of this sample of 9 ) and obscured agn in a significant minority ( at least 1/9 here ) .",
    "probably the most interesting new findings are the cartwheel - type rings in at least 2 and possibly 3 of these galaxies .    these rings , together with the asymmetry of s10 and 16v26 ,",
    "imply that a rather large fraction , 5/9 , of the sample are post - encounter interacting galaxies , whereas only two appear to be in pre - encounter pairs .",
    "this can be compared with the ulirgs ( @xmath98 galaxies ) of clements et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , of which 55/60 are visibly disturbed or merging , and double nuclei could be resolved in 28 , i.e. about equal numbers are observed before and after nuclear coalescence / collision .",
    "a high post - encounter fraction amongst radio - selected galaxies might be expected on the basis of a model of lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , in which the synchrotron radio emission from a starburst remains strong for at least @xmath99 myr after star formation ceases .",
    "this also means that galaxies that have already been starbursting for @xmath100 myr would have higher radio luminosities per unit sfr , and higher radio / fir ratios , than near the onset of star formation .",
    "16v31 has strong @xmath101 absorption which could be fit by a delgado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) post - starburst model at age @xmath102 myr , but could also result from ` age - dependent extinction ' , with starbursting ongoing for @xmath103 yr with only the most recent star - formation ( @xmath104 yr ) obscured by dust ( poggianti , bressan and franceschini 2001 ) .",
    "the lris spectroscopy of rlk02 did not provide the line ratios , e.g. the balmer decrement , needed to distinguish these possibilities .",
    "however , the close resemblance to the cartwheel is an important clue , as the cartwheel is known to have a very high current sfr combined with @xmath25 mag extinction of the starburst emission lines .",
    "a similar picture is seen for the other 8 collisional ring galaxies studied by bransford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , including two with strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "this is significant , as prolonged starbursting with age - dependent extinction can ( in addition to producing strong balmer lines ) , explain the very low emission line to radio flux ratios of @xmath12 radio - selected galaxies in general ( see rlk02 ) .",

    "<S> using the hst wfpc2 we perform deep @xmath0-band imaging of 9 radio - selected ( @xmath1 ) faint galaxies from the roche , lowenthal and koo ( 2002 ) sample . </S>",
    "<S> two are also observed in @xmath2 using hst stis .    </S>",
    "<S> six of the galaxies have known redshifts , in the range @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> radial intensity profiles indicate that 7 are disk galaxies and 2 are bulge - dominated . </S>",
    "<S> four of the six with redshifts have a high optical surface brightness in comparison with previous studies of disk galaxies at similar redshifts ( e.g. lilly et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hst imaging reveals that 2 of the 9 galaxies are in close interacting pairs and another 5 show morphological evidence of recent interactions  two are very asymmetric ( @xmath4 ) and , three have large , luminous rings resembling the collisional starburst rings in the cartwheel galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> for the two ring galaxies with redshifts , we measure ring radii of 7.05 and 10.0 @xmath5 kpc , which suggest post - collision ages 0.10.2 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> one has a fainter inner ring , like the original cartwheel . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two appear to be late - type barred galaxies and relatively undisturbed .    </S>",
    "<S> our hst imaging confirms the high incidence of interactions and dynamical disturbance in faint radio - selected galaxies , as reported by e.g. windhorst et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1995 ) and serjeant . </S>",
    "<S> et al . ( 2000 ) . in the great majority of these galaxies </S>",
    "<S> the high radio luminosities are probably the result of interaction - triggered starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> however , one interacting galaxy is a very radioluminous giant elliptical , with red @xmath6 colours , a normal surface brightness and no evidence of star - forming regions , so its radio source is probably an obscured agn . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture of observed morphologies suggests that enhanced radio luminosities often persist to a late stage of interaction , i.e. at least @xmath7 gyr after the perigalactic encounter .    </S>",
