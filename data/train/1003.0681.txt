    "most seyfert agn are associated with weak nuclear radio sources which show radio spectral indices and morphologies ( if resolved ) consistent with synchrotron - emitting jets and lobes @xcite , though their physical properties are poorly constrained .",

    "several studies have uncovered clear signatures of interactions between the jet and surrounding gas , in the form of disturbed emission line profiles in the inner narrow - line region ( nlr ) , as well as close associations between resolved jet structures and nlr gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "shocks and winds can also change the distribution of ism phases in the nlr by destroying and ablating clouds @xcite . while the active nucleus is usually the dominant source of ionization even in strongly jetted seyferts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , widespread shocks driven by a jet can alter the ionization of the nlr by affecting the properties of the ism .",
    "studies of shock structure and energetics @xcite predict strong differences between the emission line spectrum of dense post - shock gas and gas that is ionized by , but not in direct dynamical contact with , the shock ( the precursor ) . therefore , a clear signature of shock ionized gas is a difference between the line profiles of low and high ionization lines , which are preferentially produced by post - shock and precursor gas , respectively @xcite .    in this work",

    "variations in ionization are seen across the nlr .",
    "the average excitation of region b is towards the low end of the observed range , with average [ o iii]@xmath22/h@xmath24 , while the inner part of region a is more highly ionized ( [ o iii]@xmath22/h@xmath25 ) .",
    "however , surrounding the position of the bright knot in region a , a sharp drop in the ratio is seen .",
    "interestingly , this change in ionization is velocity dependent . in the high velocity wings of the lines , the [ o iii]/h@xmath10 drops to almost unity implying a very low ionization state , while the central core of the lines remain at a more modest ionization .",
    "this trend is different from most seyferts where the high velocity gas tends to be of equal or _ higher _ ionization than low velocity material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this difference between the average ionization of the nlr and region a is brought out well by comparing the velocity profiles of [ o iii]@xmath16 and h@xmath10 in different parts of the nlr , as is done in figure 3 .",
    "the width of the h@xmath10 line compared to [ ] is substantially higher in region a , compared to both the inner part of the same region and the profiles in region b and c.    what is the reason for this peculiar ionization behaviour ?",
    "we believe this results from strong shocks driven by the radio plasma into the ism .",
    "the compressed gas in the post - shock cooling zone is expected to share the high velocities of the shock , yet is predicted to have [ o iii]/h@xmath10 in the range of @xmath26 , depending on the shock speed and local magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of line emission from shocks and possibly a precursor region , over and above the emission from gas photoionized by the agn , could then account for the appearance of the bright emission - line knot in region a associated with the radio hotspot .",
    "a moderate contribution to the line emission from shocks is also consistent with the hst spectroscopic study of @xcite . from the relative strengths of the [ sii ] @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines , which are produced profusely in the post - shock cooling zone",
    ", they estimate high temperatures ( greater than @xmath29 k ) and somewhat low electron densities ( around @xmath30 @xmath31 ) for the [ sii]-emitting gas .",
    "these values are quite reasonable for normal diffuse ism that has been compressed by a shock front . based on a simple double gaussian decomposition of the h@xmath10 line integrated across the knot , we estimate an approximate linewidth of @xmath32 km s@xmath6 for the broad component , which includes the high velocity wings .",
    "this nicely matches the predicted shock velocities from @xcite which were based on comparisons to shock ionization models of @xcite .",
    "while it is difficult to directly associate shock speeds with integrated line kinematics , this broad consistency adds credence to a shock - driven origin for the emission of the knot in region a.",
    "our combination of high spatial resolution optical spectroscopy and imaging provide the best existing view of the compact jet - ism interaction in ngc 5929 .",
    "high velocity gas is only seen at the location of the south - western radio hotspot , while in other parts of the nlr , linewidths are narrow and a velocity gradient expected from virial motion is seen , consistent with ground - based slit and ifu spectroscopy @xcite .    we adopt a simple model for the jet interaction , following that of @xcite .",
    "the radio jet plows through the ism as it propagates outward , driving strong shocks at its head ( the radio hotspot ) . as this",
    "shocked gas cools and gets denser , it becomes the [ ] -emitting gas described by @xcite and creates the broad h@xmath10 emission .",
    "@xcite model the properties of post - shock gas as a function of shock velocity @xmath33 , pre - shock density and magnetic field strength .",
    "taking a magnetized shock as fiducial , the [ ] -derived densities and @xmath34 km s@xmath6(from the linewidth of the broad h@xmath10 component ) imply a pre - shock density of @xmath35 @xmath31 and a shock cooling length around tens of parsecs .",
    "the pre - shock density estimate has a large uncertainty and could be as low as 1 @xmath31 if the shocks are weakly magentized , which would also decrease the cooling length significantly .",
    "however , since seyfert jets are generally associated with mg level magnetic field , we adopt our estimates for magnetic shocks as most likely .",
    "the cooling length we derive is resolved in our hst images and may explain the small offset of @xmath36 between the location of the radio hotspot and the peak of the line emission in region a. this interpretation is very tentative , since patchy dust obscuration is the region may also cause such an offset .",
    "@xcite estimate flux densities , radio spectral indices and source sizes for the various components of the radio source , from which we calculate radio source equipartition pressures , using the relations of @xcite and assuming that the radio emitting plasma has a filling factor of unity and an ion fraction @xmath37 , and that the radio spectrum extends from 0.01 ghz to 100 ghz with a constant spectral index of -0.82 .",
    "the equipartition synchrotron pressure of the radio hotspot is @xmath38 dyne @xmath39 , which may be compared to the ram pressure of the shock front , @xmath40 dyne @xmath39 .",
    "the two pressures are comparable , consistent with the view that the shocked gas surrounds and confines the radio hotspot .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that such pressures are considerably higher than those typically found in seyfert radio sources , which may indicate that this is a relatively young jet ejection event .",
    "eventually , interactions with the surrounding gas will confine the jet flow into a static lobe , like those found in late - stage interactions @xcite .",
    "why do we see such obvious signatures of shocks in this object and not in others ?",
    "this may be due to the weakness of the agn : ngc 5929 has an absorption - corrected hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath41 erg s@xmath6  low compared to average local seyferts @xcite . or perhaps the nuclear environment of the galaxy is dense and gas - rich due to its ongoing merger .",
    "this will lower the ionization parameter of nuclear radiation and produce a more compact emission line region . in both scenarios ,",
    "the influence of the nucleus at larger radii will be relatively unimportant , making shock ionized line emission visible against the general background of centrally ionized gas .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it implies that radiative shock ionization from nuclear outflows is widespread in seyfert nlrs , but is usually secondary to nuclear photoionization processes and only visible in low - luminosity seyferts or those with dense nuclear environments .",
    "a rich nuclear environment raises another possibility that the jet is impacting a dense molecular cloud , enhancing the shock luminosity .",
    "this may explain why no clear shock signatures are seen around the ne radio hotspot , though the obscuration of the main dust lane prevents a direct view of this region .",
    "the luminosity of the broad h@xmath10 component is @xmath42 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "following @xcite , the h@xmath10 flux scales with the total radiative flux from the shock , with a weak dependence on @xmath33 , giving shock luminosities of @xmath43 erg s@xmath6  comparable or slightly less than the total luminous output of the agn ( taking a x - ray bolometric correction of @xmath44 ) . using standard relationships from @xcite , the h@xmath10 luminosity can be used to derive the mass of ionized gas in the broad component : @xmath45 m@xmath46 .",
    "if this mass of gas was accelerated to @xmath33 , it would have a total kinetic energy of @xmath47 ergs .",
    "taking the approximate acceleration timescale to be the crossing time of the region of size 03 ( 48 pc ) at @xmath33 ( around @xmath48 yr ) , a lower limit on the ` kinetic luminosity ' of the jet is estimated to be @xmath49 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this is few to several percent of the total agn energy output . given that jet outflows are a relatively common feature of seyfert activity and couple strongly to the ism through shocks , jet driven feedback can effectively carry as much as energy as the agn photon luminosity to kpc scales , and transfer a tenth or less of this energy in the form of kinetic energy to the nlr .",
    "this can have important consequences for the suppression of bulge star - formation and the energy budget and dynamics of circum - nuclear gas .",
