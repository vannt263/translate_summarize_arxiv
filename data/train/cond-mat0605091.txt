    "the coupling between electrons and lattice degrees of freedom in strongly correlated systems has been the subject of several experimental and theoretical investigations showing that low dimensional materials are prone to structural distortions driven by electron - phonon interaction@xcite .",
    "the most celebrated case is the peierls instability , extensively studied in weakly correlated models : the ground state of a one dimensional electron - phonon system is characterized by a lattice distortion which opens a gap at the fermi energy and gives rise to a charge modulation . in a half",
    "filled band , the density wave is commensurate to the lattice , the unit cell doubles and the chain shows a spontaneous dimerized ground state .",
    "when on site coulomb repulsion can not be neglected , the system displays competition between a mott insulator state with strong antiferromagnetic correlations , favored by electron - electron interaction , and a paramagnetic band insulator state stabilized by lattice effects .    experimentally , there are indications for the importance of both electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in quasi - one dimensional systems . in particular",
    "there is a wide class of low dimensional materials , like the bechgaard - fabre salts series , where the presence of these interactions leads to several modulated phases such as : charge - density - wave ( cdw ) , spin - peierls ( sp ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , spin - density - wave ( sdw ) , and even a high temperature superconducting state@xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism which drives these different orderings is not fully understood yet .",
    "a satisfactory theory should be able to explain the origin and the stability of different patterns , and the temperature scale at which they occur . in any case , the role of electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions will be instrumental for the explanation of the presence of bond and charge order .    by now ,",
    "the physics of one dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems in a rigid lattice is well understood @xcite in terms of the luttinger liquid ( ll ) paradigm : a ll is a 1d paramagnetic metal characterized by gapless excitations both in the spin and in the charge channel . in spin",
    "isotropic models , the low energy properties are determined by a single parameter denoted by @xmath3 , in particular @xmath4 for repulsive interactions and @xmath5 in the attractive regime .",
    "the former case is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic correlations , while in the latter dominant superconducting fluctuations are present .",
    "luttinger liquid theory is an invaluable tool for the study of the effects of perturbations on an interacting 1d electron gas . within this theoretical framework , it has been shown that electron - lattice coupling , impurities and interchain interaction can destabilize the ll behavior opening a gap in the spin and/or charge excitation spectrum .",
    "a charge gap leads to an insulating state whose properties depend whether the spin sector remains gapless or not .",
    "a gapless spin spectrum leads to a 1d mott insulator with ( quasi ) antiferromagnetic ordering , while a gap in the spin channel corresponds to a band insulator . in short range models , a spin gap with no charge gap preludes to a ( quasi ) superconducting state .",
    "lattice effects in quasi one dimensional organic conductors have been mostly investigated on the basis of the hubbard model with additional phonon couplings in adiabatic approximation ( peierls - hubbard model ) @xcite .",
    "recent works extended the study to include quantum effects for the phonons @xcite .",
    "however , the role of phonon coupling in 1d models which may display attractive interactions , like the @xmath0 model , received comparatively less attention @xcite . the simultaneous presence of both bond and on - site ( holstein ) phonons is likely to be an essential ingredient for a faithful representation of quasi 1d organic materials . in this paper",
    "we explore systematically the effect of adding electron - phonon interactions to the @xmath0 model by including inter - site ( bond ) and on - site ( holstein ) phonon couplings in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we aim at the understanding of the qualitative features of the lattice periodicities which are stabilized and the sequence of modulations the model undergoes when the strength of phonon couplings is varied .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian provides one of the simplest models able to capture the essential low energy physics of doped antiferromagnets .",
    "the electron dynamics is governed by a competition between two terms : the kinetic contribution which describes hopping between adjacent sites and the nearest neighbor heisenberg interaction , which favors antiferromagnetic alignment of spins .",
    "an infinite on site repulsion is also included in the model by means of a constraint .",
    "the phase diagram of the pure @xmath0 model has been numerically determined@xcite while analytic solutions are known only in the @xmath6 limit @xcite and at the supersymmetric point @xmath7 @xcite . at half",
    "filling the model reduces to the heisenberg chain and when it is adiabatically coupled to the lattice via an arbitrarily weak perturbation , the system undergoes spontaneous dimerization ( spin - peierls instability ) leading to a lattice distortion with wave vector @xmath8 : adjacent spins are paired in a singlet state and a spin gap in the excitation spectrum shows up . for electron density",
    "@xmath9 the pure @xmath0 model enters the luttinger liquid phase and , at larger @xmath2 , phase separation sets in@xcite .    the one - dimensional @xmath0 model coupled with adiabatic phonons is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10",
    "where @xmath11 are spin-@xmath12 operators at the site @xmath13 , @xmath14 are electron gutzwiller - projected creation operators and @xmath15 is the local electron density .",
    "we have also set the bare hopping integral @xmath16 to unity thereby fixing the energy scale .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ tjh ] ) includes both nearest neighbor superexchange coupling @xmath17 and coulomb repulsion @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian parametrically depends on the classical variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 which identify the bond distortion and the amplitude of the internal site vibration , respectively .",
    "the bond distortions are defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the displacement of the @xmath23 site from the equilibrium position , while the on - site displacement @xmath24 corresponds to an effective parameter which combines several processes .",
    "clearly , the physical range where the hamiltonian ( [ tjh ] ) may be used is restricted to @xmath25 .",
    "the first three terms correspond to the usual @xmath26 model coupled with adiabatic bond phonons , the next one is the holstein type interaction between the particles and the lattice , while the last two terms describe the elastic deformation energy , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the spring constants .",
    "the @xmath0 model ( [ tjh ] ) can be regarded as the strong coupling limit of the extended hubbard model when @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to a definite relationship between the hubbard and @xmath0 couplings : @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that the @xmath0 model can be also considered as an _ effective _ one band hamiltonian unrelated to the hubbard model . in this case",
    ", the superexchange coupling @xmath17 takes into account electronic processes involving other degrees of freedom ( like the oxygen orbitals in copper oxide materials and in manganites @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the effects of phonon coupling in the @xmath0 model allows to analyze the role of magnetic interactions in stabilizing lattice distortions in itinerant electron models . by varying the @xmath17 parameter we can explicitly tune the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in the system : the comparison between the ( analytical ) @xmath32 limit and the ( numerical ) finite @xmath17 results will contribute to the understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the observed periodicities . in the following we will therefore consider @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath33 as free parameters in the @xmath0 hamiltonian ( [ tjh ] )",
    "the calculations have been performed at quarter filling @xmath34 , which is an appropriate choice to mimic the behavior of the organic compounds . by use of lanczos diagonalizations",
    ", we found the lattice distortions providing the lowest energy , without any assumption on the periodicity of the broken symmetry ground state .",
    "the extremum condition defining the optimal modulation can be formally expressed as @xmath35 the sum rule @xmath36 reflecting the ring geometry of the model has been implemented by use of a lagrange multiplier , while no constraint on @xmath37 has been imposed .",
    "here @xmath38 is the ground - state expectation value obtained by exact diagonalization using the lanczos algorithm . in order to find the bond length configuration which minimizes the total energy @xmath39 , at fixed spring constants @xmath40 , we iterate the set of equations ( [ self ] ) until convergence is reached .    following a previous investigation@xcite we chose open shell boundary conditions in order to mimic the gapless behavior of the ( pure ) @xmath0 model in the thermodynamic limit when studying a small size chain ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "in the special limit @xmath42 ( and @xmath43 ) the problem can be solved analytically even in the thermodynamic limit because the charge and spin degrees of freedom exactly factorize at all length scales @xcite . by setting @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ tjh ] ) the hamiltonian reduces to the pure kinetic contribution . in 1d",
    "the single occupancy constraint of the @xmath0 model can be explicitly taken into account by promoting the spinful electron to spinless fermions . the original electron problem at quarter filling then maps into the adiabatic su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite for spinless fermions at half filling with an additional local potential @xmath24 and elastic deformation energies .",
    "being at half filling , the hamiltonian ( [ tjh ] ) is unstable toward dimerization and a gap in the energy spectrum opens for arbitrarily weak electron phonon coupling . in the ssh adiabatic case ( @xmath45 ) a dimerized lattice distortion pattern with uniform charge",
    "is stabilized and gives rise to a bond ordered wave ( bow ) . in the pure holstein case ( @xmath46 ) the lattice is undistorted and a cdw forms . a competition between bow and cdw dimerizations",

    "the result is shown in fig.[fig1 ] : the asymptotic form of the transition line for large elastic constants ( i.e. for weak distortions ) is given analytically by @xmath59 .",
    "we observe that at small @xmath28 a charge dimerization in the undistorted lattice ( @xmath60 cdw state : see fig.[fig2]d ) prevails , while in the rest of the phase diagram a dimerized lattice with uniform charge ( @xmath60 bow state : see fig.[fig2]a ) is stabilized . in both cases",

    "an analogous scenario is expected in the cdw phase , where the lattice is uniform but the charge is dimerized ( see fig.[fig2]d ) . in this case",

    "the effects of charge and bond ordering have been extensively investigated in the extended hubbard model@xcite adiabatically coupled with the lattice . a ground state phase diagram obtained as a function of the electron - phonon interaction shows the same periodicities that we found in our model , with the exception of the bcdw regime whose bond pattern follows the s - w - s - w@xmath99 sequence . by lowering @xmath17 or by adding the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath18 , the s - w - s - w@xmath99 is recovered in a small window close to the bcdw phase boundary .",
    "this analytical and numerical study represents the first attempt to investigate the interplay of bond and holstein phonons in the one dimensional @xmath0 model .",
    "the results show an overall similarity with respect to previous studies for the hubbard model . however , even when the bond pattern is similar , the corresponding charge density wave displays different features between the two models due to the presence of a finite range attraction , of magnetic origin , in the @xmath0 systems .",
    "a nearest neighbor attraction smears the strong charge oscillations present , for instance , in the @xmath60 cdw phase of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "a direct measure of charge and bond patterns in organic conductors will help in understanding the role of direct magnetic coupling in real materials .",
    "finally , another remarkable result which emerges form this work is the counter - intuitive suppression of antiferromagnetic ( quasi ) long range order in strongly correlated models when @xmath17 is _ increased _ , due to the coupling to the lattice which drives a @xmath76 instability , leading to a spin - peiers state .        c. bourbonnais and d. jerome , ( cond - mat /9903101 ) _ advances in synthetic metals , twenty years of progress in science and technology _ ( elsevier , new york , 1999 ) , pp . 206 - 301 .",
