    "considerable interest in the rapid development of a near - infrared ( nir ) camera for the magellan project was generated after first light for the 6.5 m magellan  i ( walter baade ) telescope in september 2000 .",
    "the main requirements included excellent image quality to sample the superb seeing observed at magellan , high - throughput , and a simple design that could be completed relatively quickly .",
    "in addition , the instrument was envisioned to eventually occupy one of the folded ports ( formerly known as auxiliary nasmyth ports ) and thus remain available for use at all times .",
    "the ready availability of the camera during any observing run was motivated by one of the science goals : time - critical observations of temporally variable objects , such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts .",
    "scientific interests of astronomers at the carnegie observatories and other members of the magellan consortium included follow - up observations of interesting objects discovered in wide - field infrared surveys on smaller telescopes , high - redshift quasars and clusters of galaxies , counterparts to galactic x - ray sources , and searches for the galaxies responsible for quasar absorption systems .",
    "these science goals led to panic ( persson s auxiliary nasmyth infrared camera ) , an all - refractive , @xmath4 @xmath5 m camera that reimages the @xmath6 input beam of the 6.5 m magellan telescopes to produce a plate scale of @xmath7 pixel@xmath2 on its rockwell hawaii hgcdte focal plane array ( 1024x1024 18.5 @xmath5 m pixels ) .",
    "use of a compact , all - refractive design and adoption of the electronics and control software from the recently completed wide - field , nir camera wirc@xcite minimized development costs and led to a relatively short construction time .",
    "the optical design was optimized to critically sample the best images produced by the magellan telescopes .",
    "typically , these telescopes produce images of @xmath8 or better at visible - wavelengths and a plate scale of @xmath7 pixel@xmath2 was chosen to sample the expected image quality at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the principal and folded ports of the magellan telescopes are designed to be fed by the gregorian @xmath6 secondary mirror , which produces a focal plane scale of @xmath9 mm per arcsecond .",
    "panic reimages the telescope focal plane from @xmath6 to @xmath10 and produces a @xmath11 field of view .",
    "two other key considerations for the optical design were high - throughput in a compact design and a relatively warm temperature for the camera optics support structure of 200 k ( compared to 77 k more typical of nir instruments ) .",
    "the significant cost savings and ease of construction associated with a smaller instrument motivated an all - refractive design .",
    "the glasses used include ir - grade fused silica , caf2 , pbh1 , and the ohara glass s - ftm16 , where the latter was chosen because it forms an excellent infrared achromat with caf2 .",
    "ir - grade fused silica was chosen for the vacuum window because of its excellent durability .",
    "one key advantage of the warmer optical elements lies in reduced uncertainty in the refractive indices , particularly s - ftm16 .",
    "the refractive indices for s - ftm16 and pbh1 at 200  k and 77  k , respectively , were calculated with a temperature - dependent refractive index model@xcite .",
    "this model adds temperature - dependent terms to the common sellmeier dispersion formula and successfully reproduces the measured temperature - dependent dispersion for caf2 , among other materials .",
    "there are also mechanical and thermal advantages discussed below in sections  [ sec : mech ] and [ sec : thermal ] .",
    "the optical design is listed in table  [ tbl : optics ] and shown in figure  [ fig : optics ] .",
    "the all - spherical optical elements were manufactured by janos technology inc .",
    "the design produces an rms spot radius of 3 @xmath5 m on axis and better than 4 @xmath5 m images at the edges of the field . because the field lens , which serves as the vacuum window of the dewar , is not an achromat the position of the pupil image is mildly wavelength dependent . since the cold stop is most critical for masking thermal radiation from the telescope structure surrounding the secondary mirror , the fixed cold stop in panic",
    "was positioned and sized for the red end of the nir @xmath12 filter at approximately 2.3 @xmath5 m , the wavelength region where thermal radiation is most significant .",
    "another trade off in this simple design is the lack of a well - collimated beam , which precludes addition of a grism for spectroscopy .",
    "panic was successfully commissioned on the magellan  ii ( clay ) telescope in april 2003 and immediately went into regular operation . aside from standard instrument checkout and calibration frames ,",
    "the main task for the commissioning run was accurate alignment of the instrument pupil . because panic has a fixed pupil mask , the pupil alignment was performed by tip - tilting the instrument on the rotator mount .",
    "this was accomplished by identifying a minimum in the sky background through the @xmath12 filter while pointing at a region of relatively blank sky .",
    "the standard mode of detector readout is through the common technique of double - correlated sampling .",
    "the detector gain , readnoise , and linearity were measured and found to be well within expected values .",
    "the gain is approximately @xmath13 dn@xmath2 and the readnoise has been reduced to nearly @xmath14 after some additional grounding was performed at the telescope .",
    "the detector remains linear to better than 1% below @xmath15 at typical background rates ( appropriate to the sky background flux through the @xmath12 filter on a warm night ) , deteriorating to 5% nonlinear at @xmath16 .",
    "saturation occurs at approximately @xmath17 counts .",
    "the detector nonlinearity is quite repeatable and corrected as part of the standard data processing pipeline described above .",
    "the dark current was measured and found to be less than @xmath18 s@xmath2 .",
    "dark frames are not typically obtained , although they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes when the sky counts do not dominate the noise statistics , or for twilight flats .    during the commissioning period images as good as @xmath3 fwhm",
    "were observed at @xmath12 .",
    "the optical design is thus performing extremely well , even producing marginally undersampled data under the best conditions .",
    "more typical observed image quality is @xmath19 fwhm . as an illustration of the image quality",
    ", a 12 minute @xmath12 exposure of the antennae galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : antennae ] .",
    "stellar sources are @xmath20 fwhm .",
    "the standard mode of observations in the nir is to obtain observations at many , slightly offset positions on the sky in order to obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the sky background . to maximize observation efficiency ,",
    "a series of observation macros were incorporated into the data acquisition software that automatically make small offsets of the telescope and guide cameras .",
    "these observation macros include a number of five- and nine - position dither sequences and the size of the offset between each sky position can be tuned to account for the image quality or obtain a large area .",
    "the most efficient strategy is to maximize the time between readouts and between telescope offsets . for such cases the on - sky",
    "efficiency has been measured to approach 90% .",
    "panic moved to the east nasmyth port of the 6.5 m magellan  i ( walter baade ) telescope in july 2003 and is expected to move to one of the folded ports of the baade telescope within the next year . during its first year of operation , panic has proved to be one of the most reliable instruments at the magellan observatory .",
    "it is currently in use on most bright nights and routinely produces some of the best image quality , as is expected in the nir .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the machinists , technicians , and programmers who have contributed to panic : estuardo vasquez , darrell gilliam , ken clardy , robert storts , and vincent kowal .",
    "we also thank the excellent staff at las campanas observatory in chile , and particularly miguel roth and oscar duhalde for their assistance during commissioning .",
    "we also greatly appreciate the financial support provided by the carnegie observatories .",
