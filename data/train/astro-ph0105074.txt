    "the supernovae of type ia are crucial in understanding a number of astrophysical problems of primary importance , such as the supernova ( sn ) progenitors , the determinations of cosmological constants , the chemical enrichment of galaxies and the thermal history of the interstellar ( ism ) and intracluster ( icm ) medium . in the past year",
    "there has been a great deal of work concerning the different roles of different types of sne on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "tinsley ( 1980 ) first discussed the possibility of iron being mostly produced in sne of type i ( the distinction in type ia and ib was not common at that time ) and in the following years type ia supernovae started to be considered as important iron contributors in the chemical evolution of galaxies ( greggio and renzini 1983a , b ; matteucci and greggio 1986 ) . in particular , the observed [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation was interpreted as due to the different roles played by sne of type ii ( explosion of single massive stars ) and type ia in the production of oxygen and iron .",
    "supernovae of type ii are , in fact , responsible for the bulk of oxygen and for part of iron production whereas type ia are responsible for a large fraction of iron production , the exact value depending on the assumed initial mass function .    at the same time models for the progenitors of sne of type ia",
    "were developed ( iben and tutukov 1984 ; 1985 ) .",
    "such models suggest that these sne may originate from white dwarfs in binary systems , either systems with two white dwarfs or systems with one white dwarf and a red ( super ) giant , as originally proposed by whelan and iben ( 1973 ) . in parallel ,",
    "models of explosive nucleosynthesis for such systems ( mostly the c - deflagration / detonation of a c - o white dwarf of chandrasekhar mass ) were also presented : the most famous of these models being the w7 model of nomoto et al . ( 1984 ) .",
    "calculations of the type ia sn rates were performed on the basis of these models ( greggio and renzini 1983b ; matteucci and greggio 1986 ; matteucci and tornamb 1987 ; tornamb and matteucci 1987 ; matteucci and tornamb 1988 ) both for our galaxy and for elliptical galaxies .",
    "in particular tornamb and matteucci ( 1987 ) and matteucci and tornamb ( 1988 ) showed that the predicted type ia rates for our galaxy and elliptical galaxies are very different because of the differences in their histories of star formation .",
    "they showed that the maximum of the type ia sn rate in ellipticals occurs much earlier than in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the same result was shown more recently by matteucci ( 1994 ) who adopted a more sophisticated model , including dark matter , for the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this result has strong implications on the definition of the typical timescale for the chemical enrichment by type ia sne .",
    "yoshii et al .",
    "( 1996 ) pointed out that the typical timescale for the enrichment from sn ia in the solar vicinity can be identified with the time at which the [ o / fe ] ratio starts changing its slope .",
    "independently of the assumed model for progenitors of type ia sne , these authors identified that this timescale for the solar neighbourhood is @xmath10 gyr , in agreement with previous estimates by matteucci and franois ( 1992 ) . by coincidence ,",
    "the value of [ fe / h ] at which the [ o / fe ] ratio changes slope coincides with the transition between halo and disk ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 -1.0 ) .",
    "therefore , this timescale can also be taken as an indicator for the duration of the halo - thick disk phase .",
    "however , @xmath11 can not be universal , as it is often claimed in the literature , but it depends strongly on the assumed star formation history . as a consequence of that , we expect that the [ @xmath12/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relationships to be different in galaxies with different histories of star formation ( matteucci 1991 ) .",
    "we will compute here the typical timescale for the maximum enrichment from type ia sne , @xmath11 , in galaxies with different histories of star formation ( starburst , elliptical and spiral galaxies ) , defined as the time of the maximum in the type ia sn rate .",
    "in particular , in the framework of different star formation histories , we will explore different progenitor models for type ia sne , such as the modification proposed by greggio ( 1996 ) to the classical rate computed by greggio and renzini ( 1983b ) and the more recent model proposed by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1999 ) .",
    "in section 2 we recall the most popular models for the progenitors of type ia sne and define @xmath11 . in section 3",
    "we compute the rates of sne of type ia in galaxies of different morphological type . in section 4",
    "we discuss the effects of different type ia sn rates on galactic chemical evolution .",
    "finally , in section 5 some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the main observational constraints about sneia are the lack of hydrogen lines , the presence of siii lines , together with some other intermediate - mass elements ( caii , sii , oi ) , with a wide range of velocities ( @xmath13 km s@xmath14 ) , which dominate the photospheric spectra near the time of the maximum light . in the later nebular phase ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by iron features , thus indicating that the inner layers consist of iron - peak elements ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "most of the observed snia lie in a narrow range of parameters ( spectra , light curves , absolute magnitude peak ) and only @xmath1 10 % of the observational sample are conspicuously peculiar ( mainly subluminous ) .    in the light of these constraints , it is widely accepted that sneia originates from the thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf ( wd ) which accretes material from a companion star in close binary systems , but there are still a number of uncertainties about the nature of the companion ( main sequence star , red giant or another wd ) , the nature of the white dwarf ( c - o wd , he wd or o - ne - mg wd ) , the mass reached by the accretor at the explosion ( chandrasekhar or sub - chandrasekhar ) and the explosion mechanism itself ( deflagration , delayed - detonation or detonation ) .",
    "however , there is a general consensus in assuming that a c - deflagration in a c - o wd of chandrasekhar mass best represents the characteristics of the majority of the sne ia .",
    "we recall here the most common models for the progenitors of type ia sne proposed insofar :    * the merging of two c - o wds , due to gravitational wave radiation , which reach the chandrasekhar mass and explode by c - deflagration ( iben and tutukov 1984 ; 1985 ) .",
    "this is known as double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario . *",
    "the c - deflagration of a chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath16 ) c - o wd after accretion from a non - degenerate companion ( whelan and iben 1973 ; munari and renzini 1992 ; kenyon et al .",
    "this model is known as the single - degenerate ( sd ) one .",
    "the main problem with this scenario is the narrow range of permitted values of the mass accretion rate in order to obtain a stable accretion , instead of an unstable accretion with a consequent nova explosion and mass loss . in this case , in fact",
    ", the wd never achieves the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "in particular , nomoto , thielemann & yokoi ( 1984 ) found that a central carbon - deflagration of a wd results for a high accretion rate ( @xmath17 ) from the secondary to the primary star ( the wd ) .",
    "they found that @xmath18 of fe plus traces of elements from c to si are produced in the deflagration , well reproducing the observed spectra . *",
    "a sub - chandrasekhar c - o wd exploding by he - detonation induced by accretion of he - rich material from a he star companion ( limongi and tornamb 1991 ) . * a recent model by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1999 ) is based on the classical scenario of whelan and iben ( 1973 ) ( namely c - deflagration in a wd reaching the chandrasekhar mass after accreting material from a star which fills its roche lobe ) , but they find an important metallicity effect .",
    "when the accretion process begins , the primary star ( wd ) develops an optically thick wind which helps in stabilizing the mass transfer process .",
    "when the metallicity is low ( @xmath19 < -1 $ ] ) , the stellar wind is too weak and the explosion can not occur .",
    "this model is appealing since it overcomes the difficulty of achieving a stable accretion as in the classic sd scenario discussed above .",
    "however , this model still needs to be tested in several astrophysical contexts , as we will see in the next sections .",
    "it is worth noting that in the last few years the dd scenario has lost some credibility with respect to the sd scenario , mostly because of the negative results of observational searches for very close binary systems made of massive enough white dwarfs ( bragaglia et al .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will concentrate on the sd model .      in the framework of the sd scenario , the explosion timescales for different progenitor models",
    "are given by the lifetime of the secondary star .",
    "in particular :    * in the formulation of the type ia rate by greggio and renzini ( 1983b ) ( hereafter gr83 ) , based on the whelan and iben ( 1973 ) model ( hereafter wi73 ) the explosion times correspond to the lifetimes of stars in the mass range @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the maximum initial mass which leads to the formation of a c - o wd is @xmath21 , although stellar models with overshooting predict a lower value ( e.g. marigo et al .",
    "1996 ) , which means that the first system , made of two @xmath22 stars , explodes after @xmath23 years from the beginning of star formation .",
    "the minimum mass of the binary system is assumed to be 3 m@xmath24 , to ensure that the wd and the companion are large enough to allow the c - o wd with the minimum possible mass ( @xmath25 , since stars with masses below this limit can only become he - wds ) to reach the chandrasekhar mass after accretion .",
    "the smallest possible secondary mass is @xmath26 and therefore the maximum explosion time is the age of the universe .",
    "this ensures that this model is able to predict a present time sn ia rate for those galaxies where star formation must have stopped several gyr ago , such as ellipticals . *",
    "greggio ( 1996 ) ( hereafter g96 ) revised the computation of the sn ia rate in the framework of the sd model and suggested a more detailed criterium for the formation of a system which can eventually explode as type ia sn .",
    "in particular , the explosion will occur when : + @xmath27 + where @xmath28 is the envelope mass of the evolving secondary and @xmath29 is the accretion efficiency , namely the mass fraction of the envelope which accretes over the wd .",
    "the maximum value for the efficiency is @xmath30 .",
    "the mass @xmath31 is the mass of the white dwarf : we have assumed three different @xmath32 relationships , from renzini and voli ( 1981 ) ( rv81 ) , from iben ( 1991 ) ( i91 ) and from marigo et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1998 ) ( mbc ) .",

    "if we compare this model with the gr83 model , we see that the explosion timescales here are much longer , since the most massive secondary is a @xmath36 star with a lifetime of @xmath37 years , instead of a @xmath22 with a lifetime of @xmath38 years .",
    "in addition , the systems able to give rise to sne ia may form only after the gas has reached a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath39 dex ( k98 ) or [ fe / h ] @xmath40 dex ( ktn ) , and this introduces an additional delay which has important consequences on galactic chemical evolution as we will see in the next sections .",
    "we adopt as definition of the _ typical timescale for the type ia sn maximum enrichment _ the time @xmath11 at which the snia rate reaches a maximum .",
    "as we will see in the next sections this maximum depends upon the assumed type ia sn progenitor model , namely the lifetimes of the progenitors and the initial mass function ( imf ) , and the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the combination of all these parameters creates different shapes and different maxima in the type ia sn rate versus time relationship .",
    "in this section we describe the computation of the sn ia rate according to different histories of star formation : a ) an instantaneous burst ( one stellar generation ) , b ) constant star formation rate , c ) a more realistic star formation rate derived in the framework of chemical evolution models .    *",
    "\\a ) the calculation of the snia rate following a burst of star formation of negligible duration , in the framework of the sd scenario and the wi73 model , can be expressed as : + @xmath41 + where @xmath42 is the total mass of the binary system , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the minimum and maximum masses for the binary systems contributing at the time @xmath45 .",
    "the maximum value that @xmath46 can assume is called @xmath47 and the minimum @xmath48 . these values ( maximum and minimum mass of the binary system able to produce a snia explosion )",
    "are model - dependent .",
    "in particular , gr83 considered that only stars with @xmath49 could develop a degenerate c - o core , thus obtaining an upper limit @xmath50 for the mass of the binary system .",
    "the adopted lower limit is ( @xmath51 ) , as discussed previously .",
    "the extremes of the integral ( 2 ) , at a fixed time @xmath45 , are : + @xmath52 + @xmath53 + where @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "+ we define @xmath56 as the mass fraction of the secondary and @xmath57 is the distribution function of this ratio .",
    "statistical studies ( e.g. tutukov & yungelson 1980 ) indicates that mass ratios close to one are preferred , so the formula : + @xmath58 + is commonly adopted ( gr83 ) , with @xmath59=2 as a parameter .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that in the literature there are different suggestions about the value of @xmath59 .",
    "for example , duquennoy and mayor ( 1991 ) found a value of @xmath59=-0.35 , the value adopted in k98 .",
    "therefore , we will explore in this paper more values for the parameter @xmath59 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "+ in order to obtain the snia rate , we need also the function @xmath60 . to this purpose",
    "we adopt the inverse of the formula : + @xmath61/0.1116}\\,\\rm yr,\\ ] ] + ( padovani & matteucci 1993 ) .",
    "+ k98 adopted stellar lifetimes depending on the initial stellar metallicities from kodama ( 1997 ) : these timescales are systematically longer than ours especially in the domain of low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "+ the function @xmath62 is the imf : + @xmath63 + where @xmath64 is the salpeter ( 1955 ) index and the imf is defined in the mass interval 0.1 - 100 @xmath65 . in the paper",
    "we have used both the salpeter and the scalo(1986 ) imf . finally , the constant a , already defined in gr83 , is the fraction of binary systems , in the imf , with the right characteristics to become type ia sne and is fixed by reproducing the present time observed type ia sn rate .",
    "+ for the g96 model the expression of the sn ia rate is the same as eq . ( 2 ) whereas the lower limit for the binary system @xmath43 at the time @xmath45 is : + @xmath66 + where @xmath67 is the minimum mass the primary should have to give rise to a wd whose mass satisfies eq .",
    "we consider also a sub - chandrasekhar model in which the explosion occurred when @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for this model",
    "we assume @xmath70 . + the calculation of the snia rate with ktn prescriptions is a little more complicated , because we have different restrictions for the primary and the secondary star : the secondary lies in a narrow range of masses ( @xmath71 for the wd+rg system and @xmath72 for the wd+ms system )",
    ". then , k98 and ktn consider only wds with masses @xmath73 , which corresponds to an interval for the primary star @xmath74 . in this case",

    ". as one can see , in the first two cases the rate first increases , reaches a maximum at @xmath83 years and then declines .",
    "this behaviour is due to the competition between the increasing number of stars with decreasing mass ( imf ) and the increasing stellar lifetime with decreasing mass .",
    "the maximum in the g96 cases is slightly anticipated relative to gr83 , owing to the fact that a maximum mass producing a c - o wd of 8.8 @xmath65 was adopted .",
    "the other differences between the g96 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and gr83 ( @xmath85 ) cases are due to condition ( 1 ) and the different @xmath86 relations adopted . on the other hand , the g96 ( @xmath87 ) cases predict quite different sn ia rates .",
    "in particular , as the efficiency of mass transfer decreases , the number of systems able to produce a type ia sn is drastically reduced because of condition ( 1 ) . as a consequence of this , the case with @xmath88 predicts that type ia sn rate following an instantaneous burst goes to zero already after a time smaller than 1 gyr . + the rate predicted by the ktn model shows instead a completely different behaviour , with a discontinuity due to jump from 1.8 @xmath65 to 1.5 @xmath65 in the mass of the secondary passing from the system wd + ms to wd + rg . in figure 1 the rates are normalized to their own maximum value as in gr83 , whereas in figure 2 we plot the absolute sn rates normalized to reproduce a short starburst like those occurring in blue compact galaxies . in particular , we assumed a=0.006 , a value which can reproduce the features of izw18 ( see recchi et al .",
    "\\b ) the single - burst approximation could be valid only for starburst galaxies whereas for elliptical and spiral galaxies we must consider a star formation extended in time . in the case",
    "in which the sfr , @xmath89 , is constant in time , we obtain : + @xmath90 + where @xmath91 is defined in the range @xmath92 , with : + @xmath93 + for gr83 and g96 , whereas for ktn we define : + @xmath94 + and : @xmath95 the equation ( 11 ) is useful to calculate the snia rate in the gr83 and g96 cases either for a burst with constant star formation rate or for the solar neighbourhood where the sfr has not varied much in time , whereas in all the other cases a constant sfr represent a poor approximation . for a correct use of the assumption of k98 and ktn we must consider the metal enrichment of the ism ( we can not produce snia progenitors until @xmath19 = -1.0 $ ] ( k98 ) or @xmath96 ( ktn ) .",

    "the star formation rate in this case has to be evaluated at the time @xmath98 , with @xmath99 being the clock for the explosion . in figure 3",

    "it is worth noting that the model parameters in m1 are the same adopted in the chemical evolution model described in ktn .",
    "the model with one infall but the prescriptions of gr83 ( m3 ) predicts a maximum at around @xmath107 gyr , whereas the two - infall model ( m2 ) predictions are a bit more complicated showing two maxima , the first one at @xmath108 gyr , due to the first infall episode and the associated star formation , and the second one between 4 and 5 gyr due to the sn ia systems born at the beginning of the thin - disk formation .",

    "the absolute type ia sn rates , computed by means of the models of table 1 , are presented . in order to compute the absolute rates we had to assume a specific value for the constant a , which represents the fraction of binary systems in the imf developing a type ia sn explosion . in principle , the parameter a should be fixed by reproducing the observed sn ia rate but it should also assume reasonable values . in our best model ( m2 ) , which adopts a scalo ( 1986 ) imf with two slopes ( @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 ) , the adopted value is a = 0.05 and the predicted present time type ia sn rate is in good agreement with the observed one ( @xmath118 sn 100 @xmath119 , with @xmath120 , cappellaro et al .",

    "we could obtain a reasonable value for the sn ia rate with the k98 and ktn prescriptions only by assuming @xmath125 , which is a very high and perhaps unrealistic value for such a fraction .",
    "in fact , a fraction of 30 % of binary systems giving rise to type ia sne would imply a total fraction of interacting binaries in the mass range producing the sne larger than 50 % ( de donder and vanbeveren 2001 ) .",
    "the same problem arises with the g96 prescriptions , as we can see in figure 4 where the rates of type ia sn , as predicted by models m4 and m5 , are shown .",
    "in fact , models m4 and m5 predict too low type ia sn rates at the present time unless we assume @xmath125 . the differences between m4 and m5 are due only to the different @xmath126 relations adopted in the two cases .",
    "in this section we discuss the impact of the different sn ia rates we have discussed up to now on the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relationship , which is often used in the literature to infer the timescale for sn ia enrichment . in figure 5 we show the data from gratton et al .",

    "these latter seem to be the best in reproducing the observed trend but this result is not clear .",
    "in fact , the predictions of our m1 ( see figure 5 ) , which is the copy of ktn model , show a very different behaviour which is , in our opinion , more understandable : in particular , it does not show any change in slope in the [ o / fe ] ratio over the whole range of [ fe / h ] , since the first systems giving rise to type ia sne form only when the gas reaches the metallicity [ fe / h]=-1.1 , and therefore they will contribute to the chemical enrichment much later than the time corresponding to [ fe / h]=-1.1 dex and even [ fe / h]=-1.0 dex , as indicated by the maximum of the sn ia rate occurring at 8 gyr .",
    "we do not understand how k98 , who assumed [ fe / h]=-1.0 dex as the limiting metallicity for the formation of the type ia sn progenitors , can find a change in slope right at this precise metallicity .",
    "we conclude that the type ia sn rate suggested by k98 and ktn , besides giving too low values for the present time rate , unless an enormous amount of binary systems is assumed , can not reproduce the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relationship .",
    "this relationship , in fact , is characterized observationally by a marked change in slope occurring at around [ fe / h]=-1.0 dex , which corresponds to the transition between halo and disk metallicities . in our best model",
    "the change in slope occurs roughly at this point and it corresponds to a galactic age of @xmath1 1 gyr .",
    "this timescale , in turn , corresponds to the first maximum reached by the type ia sn rate in the two - infall model and can be considered as the typical timescale for the sn ia enrichment to become important .",
    "it is worth noting that in our best model the trend of the [ o / fe ] ratio for [ fe / h ] @xmath127 1.0 dex is not flat but it shows a slight slope since the very first type ia sne start occurring already at 30 myr from the beginning of star formation ( gr83 model ) , as discussed also by chiappini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in conclusion , the best prescriptions for progenitor models of type ia sne in order to reproduce the observed type ia sn rate and the chemical evolution of the galaxy is still the gr83 model",
    "in this paper we have explored various sn ia progenitor models and the resulting sn rates for different histories of star formation and we have defined the typical timescale for the maximum chemical enrichment from type ia sne in different galaxies . we have studied the effects of the sd scenario , as originally proposed by wi73 , with the recipes of gr83 and g96 as well as the more recent sd model proposed by k98 and ktn .",
    "then we have calculated the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood in the different cases by means of chemical evolution models .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * the best prescriptions to obtain type ia sn rates in agreement with the observations seem to be those of gr83 . if one adopts the more realistic approach developed by g96 to calculate the rate of explosion of systems made of a c - o wd plus a red giant star , then a large fraction ( @xmath1 30 % ) of interacting binary systems giving rise to type ia sne is required to reproduce the observed rate and the solar fe abundance .",
    "this corresponds to an overall interacting binary frequency @xmath128 in the mass range of the primary star .",
    "the same is true for the model k98 and ktn , which presents also some other problems concerning galactic chemical evolution . * in particular",
    ", the models of k98 and ktn do not produce satisfactory results for the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation in the solar neighbourhood since it predicts that binary systems able to form type ia sne can form very late , after the gas in the galaxy has reached [ fe / h]=-1.1 -1.0 dex .",
    "this fact clearly prevents the change in slope in the [ o / fe ] ratio right at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.0 , as observed in the data .",
    "the predicted metallicity effect seems also at variance with recent observations of damped lyman-@xmath12 systems ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1999 ) indicating almost solar [ @xmath12/fe ] ratios in objects with metallicities lower than [ fe / h]=-1.0 dex , thus suggesting that type ia sne have already polluted the interstellar medium at low metallicities .",
    "however , ktn suggested a possible explanation for this effect .",
    "in particular , they attributed the almost solar ratios at low metallicities as due to inhomogeneous chemical evolution in those early phases . in our opinion",
    "this solution looks rather `` ad hoc '' and is not justifiable for metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath129 dex , since no large spread is observed for these metallicities in the abundance ratios of halo stars ( argast et al",
    ". 2000 ) * the typical timescale for the maximum chemical enrichment by sn ia , @xmath11 , can be defined as the time at which the sn ia rate reaches a maximum .",
    "this timescale depends upon the adopted sn progenitor model , the stellar lifetimes , the imf and the sfr . since galaxies of different morphological type are likely to have different histories of star formation , the typical type ia sn timescale are necessarily different from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "* we have studied different cases in the framework of gr83 model for sn ia progenitors : in an instantaneous starburst , which can approximate the situation of blue compact galaxies , @xmath130 myr , in a spiral galaxy like the milky way , where the sfr has not varied much in time but it has been more ore less continuous , @xmath131 gyr . a minor maximum appears at @xmath1 1 gyr in the two - infall model , where the halo is explicitely taken into account and which better fits the properties of the solar neighbourhood , corresponding to the bulk of type ia sne originating from the star formation in the halo . in an elliptical galaxy , where the sfr was quite high but lasted for a relatively short time ( @xmath132 gyr ) , @xmath133 gyr . *",
    "the knee observed in the [ @xmath12/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations in the solar neighbourhood stars corresponds to a timescale @xmath134 gyr .",
    "this is the time at which the fe production from type ia sne starts to become important , due to the systems formed during the halo phase , and is not a universal value but peculiar to the solar region . *",
    "the type ia sn rates per unit luminosity were plotted as function of redshift ( see figure 6 ) , in a cosmology where we assume that all the galaxies formed at @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the hubble constant is assumed to be h@xmath138 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "the photometric model we adopted is that of jimenez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) as one can see in figure 6 , where the rates for a typical elliptical and a typical spiral galaxy , expressed in snu , are shown , a maximum at a redshift @xmath139 between 3 and 4 and extending until @xmath4 should be expected for the elliptical galaxies , whereas we predict two peaks for spiral galaxies ( two - infall model ) the first at @xmath5 during the halo phase and the second at @xmath6 , during the disk phase . in the same figure are indicated the present time values for the type ia rate in ellipticals and spirals as well as the type ia rate derived at redshift @xmath140 by pain et al .",
    "the observed values have been scaled to our adopted @xmath141 .",
    "the agreement between the observed and predicted rates seems quite good ( especially for the present time rates ) , although it would be more appropriate to compute the cosmic sn rate ( i.e. weighted over the different morphological types ) in order to compare it with the high redshift observations .",
    "we are indebted to laura greggio for many discussions and for providing her code to compute the sn rates in the case of a starburst .",
    "we also thank renato manara and cristina chiappini for their contribution to this work and s. borgani for reading the manuscript .",
    "we thanks the suggestions of an anonymous referee which much improved the final version of this paper .",
