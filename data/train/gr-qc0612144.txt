    "note that @xmath98 is trivially an unitary operator in the partial physical hilbert space whereas @xmath430 is not in general .",
    "both operators are unitary in the partial kinematical hilbert space . to construct ( non trivial ) unitary operator in the partial physical hilbert space",

    "there is a natural adjoint action of @xmath3 on the set of operators defined by : @xmath431 where we have used the sweedler notation and @xmath428 is an operator .",
    "this action is well - defined . among the operators ,",
    "one distinguishes particularly the so - called observables , i.e.the operators that are invariant under the action of the quantum double ( [ actionofd ] ) .",

    "interesting operators are the monodromy around the particles and their trace are quite easy to compute . given a finite dimensional representation @xmath436 of @xmath0 and a loop @xmath143 around @xmath437 particles among the @xmath438 particles ( let us denote by @xmath439 the set of particles ) , a monodromy @xmath440 is defined by @xmath441 where the expression of the holonomy @xmath442 depends on the choice of the loop @xmath143 . if @xmath443 is a loop around the particle @xmath368 , then @xmath444 is obviously a diagonal operator whose mean value is given by the character @xmath445 .",

    "the fact that the previous map is an isometry is a consequence of the invariance of the simple intertwiner under braidings .",

    "the work we have proposed contains : a complete description of the ( partial ) physical hilbert space in the general case of any riemann surface ( i.e. states and scalar product ) and a discussion concerning the question of the observables ( i.e. their definition and the computation of their expectation values in some examples ) .",
    "we have emphasized the crucial role of the drinfeld double which is clearly the symmetry group of the quantum theory , as expected . in the lqg approach",
    ", the drinfeld double appears as a result of the dynamics in the sense that its role becomes obvious when one imposes the three dimensional analog of the `` hamiltonian '' constraint .",
    "this point of view is quite interesting because it is a non - trivial example where one sees the emergence of a non - compact quantum group ( at the level of the physical hibert space ) starting from a classical compact group ( at the level of the kinematical hilbert space ) .",
    "our construction is in that sense very different , at the conceptual level , from the combinatorial quantization , the group field theory quantization or the spin - foam quantization where the quantum group is put by hand as the basic starting block of these methods . from the point of view of a particles physicist ,",
    "our approach might seem more satisfying for we describe particles as simple representations of the `` poincare '' ( in riemannian space ) group and we notice that , using lqg techniques , scattering amplitudes of these particles in a quantum background are described in terms of intertwiners of a quantum group .",
    "in fact , in three dimensions , we see that the hamiltonian constraint ( in the presence of particles ) is in fact a simple intertwiners !",
    "thus , physical states are constructed from simple representations of the drinfeld double and the physical scalar product is in fact given by a symmetric ( or barrett - crane -bc ) intertwiner between the simple representations defining the states .",
    "the ressemblance with the usual bc model is obvious and asks the question whether the bc model is really a model of four dimensional quantum gravity or a model of three dimensional gravity coupled to particles .",
    "this paper opens new insights in lqg techniques .",
    "the first one would be to see the emergence of the quantum group @xmath488 when one imposes the hamiltonian constraint with a cosmological constant ( the quantum parameter @xmath489 is related to @xmath490 in the usual way ) .",
    "we are currently working in that direction .",
    "it seems also possible to generalize our construction to the lorentzian case because we finally do not need to make sense of the whole space of cylindrical functions but only of the space of cylindrical functions on one graph , the minimal graph .",
    "therefore , the obstruction raised in @xcite and in @xcite should not be problematic in our context . going from one minimal graph to another",
    "reduces to a non - trivial braiding which is still well defined in the lorentzian regime .",
    "moreover , one could introduce new types of particles : lightlike , spacelike or timelike particles .",
    "we could also think of introducing particles that would describe a black hole in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "another issue to be solved is to extend this construction to the case of spinning particles .",
    "this case has been considered briefly in the spin - foam approach by @xcite . in the lqg point of view",
    ", the description of the kinematical hilbert space has been performed completely in @xcite but the way that the physical scalar product is related to the quantum double remains to be understood .",
    "we expect that this link works in the same way as the non - spinning case with the difference that the physical scalar product ( or spinning particles scattering amplitudes in a quantum background ) is no longer given by a simple intertwiner but a more general @xmath3 intertwiner .",
    "in our point of view , the case of spinning particles is not a conceptual issue but only a technical issue .    in fact",
    ", the original motivation for this work , is the construction of a self - gravitating quantum field theory in the haniltonian framework .",
    "this means a precise description of the fock space associated to its creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we are finishing a work in that direction @xcite and we have shown in particular that the quantum field theory so obtained is closely related to the one constructed in @xcite in the context of spin - foam models .    finally , the last but not the least is to make use of this construction to describe a coupling of quantum gravity to matter field in four dimensions .",
    "it seems quite obvious how to generalize , at the level of the kinematical hilbert space , the coupling of spin - networks to some matter fields .",
    "the more interesting question would be to understand what kind of matter that represents and what is the dynamics of such a coupling ( see @xcite for ideas in that direction ) .",

    "<S> the interest of 3d gravity is widely limited by the fact that there is no local degrees of freedom in the theory and therefore there are many aspects of 4d gravity that will never be clarified thanks to this toy - model . in order to make 3d gravity a richer tool , </S>",

    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> after the introduction , we start by recalling the techniques used in @xcite to perform the hamiltonian quantization  la lqg of three dimensional gravity ( pure or coupled to particles ) . in particular , we clarified the link between the canonical quantization and the covariant spin - foam quantization . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this previous works , we never underline the role of the quantum double @xmath3 in our construction whereas it is clear that it should play a central role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we fill this gap within the present article . to that aim , </S>",
    "<S> we first define in the second section the notions of partial kinematical and physical hilbert space . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude with some perspectives and we postpone the construction of the fock space to thr companion paper @xcite .    in this paper , we will work with dimensionless quantities , in particular for the masses of the particles . </S>",

    "<S> the first point is completely under control and gave rise to what is commonly called quantum geometry ( for review see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) : the kinematical states ( or states of quantum geometry ) are described in term of spin - networks and their set is endowed with a hilbert structure defined by the ashtekar - lewandowski measure . </S>",
    "<S> but the construction of the physical hilbert space is one the biggest difficulties and one of the most interesting problem of lqg . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , no consistent solution have been found so far !    in a couple of papers @xcite , we have successfully studied 3d general relativity ( pure gravity and gravity coupled to particles ) as a toy - model for lqg . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have constructed the extractor @xmath8 and have shown that the physical scalar product between states has a spin - foam representation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we made the explicit relation between lqg and spin - foam models .    </S>",

    "<S> the isometry given in the previous proposition holds for any choice of minimal graph @xmath36 and any choice of observer . each partial physical hilbert space @xmath238 where @xmath36 is any minimal graph are isomorphic one to the other and therefore are equivalent . for that reason </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the notation @xmath284;g)$ ] to denote the partial physical hilbert space where @xmath285=(m_0,\\cdots , m_{n-1})$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have emphasized the explicit characteristics of the partial physical hilbert space : the topological structure of @xmath1 , the colors of the boundaries , i.e. the masses of the particles and the gauge group @xmath6 of course .    </S>",
    "<S> remark 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the order of the particles matters in the definition of @xmath284;g)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the space @xmath284;g)$ ] is completely and uniquely caracterised by a given flat graph of the type ( figure [ minimalgraph ] ) where there is an order between the links . </S>",
    "<S> if one modifies the order between the links , then the definition the structure of the partial physical hilbert space is slightly modified . </S>",
    "<S> however , two different orders define isomorphic partial physical hilbert space . for instance , if we consider a sphere @xmath286 with three particles associated to the masses @xmath287 , then the following map is an isometry : @xmath288 it is indeed easy to verify that @xmath289 . </S>",
    "<S> one can establish a more general property that we will discuss in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> remark 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical hilbert space @xmath290;g)$ ] is easily obtained as the coset : @xmath291;g ) \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; { \\cal h}_{pphys}^{g , n}([m];g)/s^1\\;.\\ ] ] the action of @xmath171 on @xmath284;g)$ ] is naturally defined by : @xmath292;g ) & \\longrightarrow & { \\cal h}_{pphys}^{g , n}([m];g ) \\\\ ( h , f ) &   \\longmapsto & f^{h}\\ ; : \\ ; y,\\tilde{z } \\ ; \\mapsto \\ ; f^h(a , b,\\tilde{z } )   \\ ; = \\ ; f(h^{-1}ah , h^{-1}bh , h^{-1}\\tilde{z})\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used the notations of the proposition ( [ philbert ] ) with @xmath293 and so on . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the physical hilbert space is obviously a sub - hilbert space of @xmath284;g)$ ] and can be obtained as the image of the following projector : @xmath294;g ) \\ ; \\longrightarrow \\ ; { \\cal h}_{phys}^{g , n}([m];g ) \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; f \\ ; \\longmapsto \\tilde{f}(a , b,\\tilde{z } ) \\ ; = \\ ; \\int dh \\ ; f(h^{-1}ah , h^{-1}bh , h^{-1}\\tilde{z})\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is in fact a trivial application of refined algebra techniques in the compact @xmath171 case . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert structure of @xmath290;g)$ ] is defined from this map as the kernel @xmath244 is invariant by the action ( [ s1action ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> remark 4 . from the very definition of the partial physical hilbert space as a subset of @xmath295 , @xmath238 is in fact a subset of @xmath296^{2 g } \\otimes   \\mathbb c[s^2]^{n-1}$ ] where @xmath296 $ ] is the group algebra and @xmath297=\\mathbb c[g]/u(1)$ ] is called the 2-sphere algebra . </S>",

    "<S> is compact there is a trivial isomorphism which identifies the spaces @xmath296^{2 g } \\otimes   \\mathbb c[s^2]^{n-1}$ ] and @xmath174 .    </S>",
    "<S> remark 5 . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that any particle @xmath158 $ ] is classically completely caracterized by its mass @xmath249 and the direction of its momentum given by @xmath186 . </S>",
    "<S> the particle @xmath172 plays the role of the observer and the variable @xmath237 does not appear anymore in the definition of partial physical states . </S>",
    "<S> one can interpret this observation by the fact that we work in the rest - frame of the observer and then @xmath237 is set to the identity : the momenta of the other particles are defined in that frame .    besides , one can caracterized the particle @xmath40 by an element @xmath298 such that @xmath299 , i.e. @xmath300 is an element of the conjugacy class of the element @xmath248 , denoted @xmath301 : @xmath302 thus , any element of @xmath284;g)$ ] can be viewed as an element of @xmath303 . using the kirillov formulae for the @xmath0 haar measure , @xmath304 the partial physical scalar product between two states @xmath103 and @xmath305 respectively associated to the functions @xmath141 and @xmath20 is then given by : @xmath306)\\ ; g(a , b , k).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recall that the functions @xmath141 and @xmath20 are non - null if @xmath307 </S>",
    "<S> . this reformulation of the partial physical hilbert space will be convenient in the next section .    </S>",

    "<S> the last remark concerns the normalization of the partial physical scalar product . whose is defined only up to a constant @xmath308)>0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the constant depends a priori on the genus @xmath20 of @xmath1 , the number of particles @xmath4 and the masses of the particles . by a direct calculation </S>",
    "<S> , one shows that the squared norm of the identity function @xmath309 \\in   { \\cal h}_{pphys}^{g , n}([m];g)$ ] is given by the volume of the space of flat @xmath0 connections on the punctured surface @xmath1 , i.e. : @xmath310 \\vert \\ ! </S>",
