    "when one considers possible fields interacting with a black hole , the simplest source of matter that one could naively take into account corresponds to a single real scalar field .",
    "however , when this field is minimally coupled and the spacetime is asymptotically flat , the so called no - hair conjecture @xcite indicates that this class of black hole does not exist .",

    "this black hole solution can be extended by considering a conformal self - interacting potential .",
    "this was done in @xcite , where exact black hole solutions are found for a minimally coupled scalar field and a one parameter family of potentials .",
    "a previous four - dimensional and asymptotically flat black hole @xcite was reported back in the 70 s , but the scalar field diverges at the horizon .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant allows to find exact four - dimensional black hole solutions , where the scalar field is regular on and outside the event horizon @xcite .",
    "numerical black hole solutions can also be found in four @xcite and five dimensions @xcite .",
    "further exact solutions in the context of low energy string theory were found in @xcite .",
    "some interesting aspects of these black hole solutions are studied in @xcite . in particular , the analysis of stability against linear perturbations for the de sitter conformally dressed black hole @xcite done in @xcite , is relevant for the discussion presented here .",
    "+ in this work , we study the space of static , spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant and a conformally coupled self - interacting scalar field ( mtz model ) .",
    "conformally coupled scalar fields in general relativity have been used to model quantum effects in semiclassical theories @xcite .",
    "this model has a well posed initial value formulation @xcite , and was shown to reproduce better -than the minimally coupled scalar field- the local propagation properties of klein gordon fields on minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "our interest , however , comes from the fact that this model allows non trivial static black holes solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions belong to a restricted class ( eq . ( [ mtz5 ] ) below ) of spherically symmetric static spacetimes , and are given in equations ( [ 1mtz ] ) ( [ 1mtzs ] ) ( solution mtz1 ) and ( [ exa1 ] ) ( solution mtz2 ) .",
    "note that a generic spherically symmetric static spacetime metric admits the local form ( [ met1 ] ) . in this work",
    "we address the following question : are there other static , spherically symmetric black hole solutions for the mtz model , satisfying the dominant and strong energy condition between the event and cosmological horizon , besides mtz1 and mtz2 ? using a combination of analytical and numerical methods we conclude that the answer to this question is negative .",

    "mtz2 had already been found to be unstable under spherically symmetric gravitational perturbations , this being our original motivation to study the space of spherically symmetric static solutions of the mtz system .",
    "this is done in section [ metric ] , where the full set of einstein and scalar field equations is reduced to a second order ode system . in section [ reghor ]",
    "we analyze the restrictions that the existence of a regular event horizon impose on the solutions , if we also require that the energy - momentum tensor satisfies appropriate energy conditions .",

    "the subset of allowed values is displayed in fig .",
    "[ modspace ] . to address the issue of the global behavior of these local solutions , the field equations were numerically integrated away from the horizon .",
    "some illustrative examples are presented in section [ numerico ] , where the different behaviors as we move away from the event horizon are shown .",
    "we find that solutions that satisfy the energy conditions near the event horizon contain , in general , a coordinate singularity for some finite @xmath2 outside the event horizon .",
    "we show that the isotropy spheres reach a maximum radius @xmath2 at this point and contract as the proper distance from the horizon further increases .",
    "this explains why @xmath2 is not an appropriate coordinate in this region .",
    "we provide an appropriate coordinate extension in section [ coord1 ] .",
    "a numerical integration beyond the coordinate singularity , described in section [ numerico1 ] , suggests that , generically , the metrics contain a curvature singularity ( the energy density diverges ) at some finite proper distance from the extension point .",

    "the present analysis , however , indicates that the parameter space for the static spherically symmetric solutions of the mtz system indeed presents a sharp discontinuity at the exact solution , with neighbouring solutions displaying properties that depart completely from those of the solution ( [ exa1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis of section [ coord1 ] shows that the coordinate system used both in @xcite and @xcite is inadequate for the perturbative study , because of the coordinate singularity intrinsic to that system .",
    "but the same analysis shows that even if the coordinate singularity is avoided , there are solutions that approach arbitrarily close to ( [ exa1 ] ) near the black hole event horizon at @xmath147 , but then depart from each other with totally different geometrical properties .",

    "<S> we find that the moduli space of static , spherically symmetric solutions that have a regular horizon -and satisfy the weak and dominant energy conditions outside the horizon- is a singular subset of a two dimensional space parameterized by the horizon radius and the value of the scalar field at the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity of this space of solutions provides an explanation for the instability of the mtz spacetimes , and leads to the conclusion that , if we include stability as a criterion , there are no physically acceptable black hole solutions for this system that contain a cosmological horizon in the exterior of its event horizon . </S>"
