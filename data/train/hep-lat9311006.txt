    "in a previous paper @xcite we studied heavy quark bound states appropriate to a description of the @xmath8 and@xmath9 systems using the non - relativistic approach of lepage ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "we investigated the lowest bound states for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 waves ignoring spin effects for the quarks using gauge configurations from the ukqcd collaboration on a @xmath12-lattice with a @xmath13-value of 6.2 . in the present paper",
    "we report results on the first excitations in the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channels for this system ( again without spin ) .",
    "we obtained these results using 60 quenched qcd configurations from the ukqcd collaboration on a @xmath1 lattice at @xmath14  .",
    "the new results are reasonably consistent with our previous ones but considerably more precise .",
    "our results are based on the construction of a number of smeared and unsmeared operators that couple to the appropriate channels and the measurement of their cross correlators .",
    "the smeared operators are constructed in a gauge invariant manner . using a simple subtraction procedure",
    "we show that the correlation functions do indeed have a multi - exponential structure .",
    "our best estimates of the lowest states and the first excited states in both the @xmath10 and @xmath11-channels of the @xmath0 system are established by performing consistent correlated fits to the measured operator correlators using appropriately factorizing two - exponential forms .",
    "some three - exponential fits were attempted to test the range of applicability of the fits but did not lead to different conclusions .",
    "the quark propagator in a given gauge field background is g(x , y)=(x)^(y )  , where the angle brackets indicate averaging over the quark degrees of freedom @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17  . when @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution for the ( non - relativistic ) quark propagator @xmath20 is g(x+,y)=u^_(x)(1-)^ng(x , y ) + _ _ t0 where @xmath21 denotes a unit step in the time direction and @xmath22 is the order of the time - step update as discussed by thacker and davies @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath23 for @xmath24  .",
    "the modified update is necessary for stability at certain values of the bare quark mass . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath25  .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 is that appropriate to non - relativistic propagation ignoring spin of a quark of mass @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 the covariant finite differences @xmath29 , @xmath30 are given by their usual expressions ( we have suppressed all colour and spin indices ) ^+_g(x , y)=u_(x)g(x+,y)-g(x , y )  , ^-_g(x , y)=g(x , y)-u^_(x- ) g(x-,y )  .",
    "the ideal method for detecting excitated states in a given channel is to construct operators each of which couples only to one of the states .",
    "an alternative approach is to accept as a starting point a basis set of operators with quantum numbers appropriate to the channel of interest and to recognize that an intermediate state will couple to each of these operators in a unique way so that the exponential contribution associated with that state to the cross correlators of the basis operators will have a factorizing form .",
    "this is the approach we have adopted in dealing with the gauge invariant smeared operators we construct and use in our simulation .",
    "the operators we investigated for the @xmath10-channel were in addition to the standard point operator ( we use @xmath31 to denote the anti - quark degrees of freedom ) o^(0)(x)=^(x)(x)+  , a set of operators of the form o^(m)(x)=_^(x)(m^m_(x ) ( x+m ) + ^m_(x)(x - m ) ) +  , where the @xmath32-sum is over space like directions and the matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 have the ( appropriately ordered ) product forms m^m_(x)=_=0^m-1 u_(x+ )   ^m_(x)=_=1^m u^_(x- )  .",
    "for the @xmath11-channel we use a family of operators of the form o_^(m)(x)=^(x)(m_^m(x ) ( x+m ) -_^m(x)(x - m ) ) +  ,    the @xmath5 wave operators are @xmath35    .-m_^m(x)(x+m ) -_^m(x)(x - m ) ) +  , and the @xmath6 wave operators are o_^dt(m)(x)=^(x)(_^(m ) _",
    "^(m ) + _ ^(m)_^(m ) ) ( x)+  , where _ ^(m)(x)=m_^m(x ) ( x+m)-_^m(x)(x - m )  .",
    "the correlation functions we measure are f^s_nm(t)=_,o^(n)(x)o^(m)(y )  , [ gr1 ] for @xmath10-wave analysis , and f^p_nm(t)=_,,o_^n(x ) o_^m(y )  , [ gr2 ] for the @xmath11-wave analysis . here",
    "@xmath36 , the spatial lattice volume .",
    "all of the above operators are of the form o(x)=^(x)(x )  , where for an appropriate set of ( @xmath37-matrix ) coefficients @xmath38 ( x)=_c_(x )  , and @xmath39  .",
    "a typical correlation function can be expressed as f_12(t)=_|g_12(x , y ) g^(x , y)+  , [ gr3 ] where    ( possibly the same ) smeared operators .",
    "of course the green s function @xmath40 where @xmath41 can be calculated with an appropriate change of initial condition by the same method as the original quark green s function .",
    "because the computing overhead is considerable it is desirable to extract as much signal as possible from each pass through a gauge field configuration . to this end",
    "we modify the measured correlators @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44as follows .",
    "eq([gr3 ] ) leads to a method of computation for our typical correlation function @xmath45 that requires the evaluation of the green s functions for at least a representative sample of @xmath46-values on the initial time slice if we wish to maximize the information to be extracted from each configuration .",
    "this is computationally onerous .",
    "an alternative procedure is the following .",
    "we replace the single @xmath47-summation in eq([gr3 ] ) with a double sum thus f_12(t)=_,,|g_12(x , y ) g^(x , y)+  , where @xmath48  .",
    "we now rely on the gauge field averaging to eliminate the contributions from the gauge non - invariant off - diagonal terms in the above double @xmath49-sum leaving only the contribution from the gauge invariant diagonal terms for which @xmath50  .",
    "the disadvantage of the method is that the off - diagonal contributions provide noise even if they do average to zero .",
    "the advantage of the method is that we pick up all the diagonal terms in one pass since it is only necessary to compute the objects of the form g(x)=_g(x , y )  , which satisfies the same equation as @xmath20 and the initial condition g(0,)=1  .",
    "similar remarks apply to @xmath51  .",
    "we have then f_12(t)=_|g_12(x)g^(x )  , in practice we do find that the method works well and does provide a good signal relatively economically .",
    "it is implicit in the discussion that no gauge fixing has been imposed on the ensemble of gauge fields .",
    "however because of the limitations of the data set the averaging procedure may not work perfectly .",
    "the different treatment of the two operators in the correlation function may mean that the symmetry @xmath52 no longer holds .",
    "this does not destroy factorization and we allow for the asymmetry in fitting the data .",
    "this procedure is similar to the multiple origin approach first utilised by kenway@xcite and billoire et al.@xcite , except we seed all sites on the initial timeslice .",
    "a quark wall source was also used by gupta et al.@xcite although they fix to coulomb gauge .",
    "as indicated above we try to fit the correlation function @xmath53 with the multi - exponential form f^s_mn(t)=_a_(a)m_(a)ne^-m_(a)t  .",
    "[ exp1 ] our main results are obtained using a two exponential form requiring eight parameters .",
    "this allows us to obtain estimates for the lowest @xmath10 and @xmath11 states together with the first excitations .",
    "our statistical method involved a correlated least squares fit based on an estimate of the complete set of variances and cross correlators of all the fitted quantities . since our results are based on 60 statistically independent gauge field configurations we felt that eight parameters was a reasonable number for the fitted form .",
    "we did perform three exponential fits in certain cases with twelve parameters .",
    "where these seemed reliable they were consistent with the two exponential fits but with considerably less tight errorbars .",
    "the results we quote are from separate @xmath10 and @xmath11-channels fits .",
    "we also carried out a combined @xmath10 and @xmath11-channel fit but obtained results that were little different .",
    "the limitations of the data led us to confine ourselves to two operators per channel in any one fit .",
    "the precise form of the @xmath54 matrix of correlators was @xmath55  = (    cc(^(1)_m)^2&^(1)_m ^(1)_n^(1 ) + ^(1)_n^(1)_m&(^(1)_n)^2^(1 )    ) e^-mt+ (    cc(^(2)_m)^2&^(2)_m^(2)_n ^(2 ) + ^(2)_n^(2)_m&(^(2)_n)^2^(2 )    ) e^-(m+m)t  .",
    "this is equivalent to the form in eq([exp1 ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the factorized forms is represented by the departure of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 from unity .",
    "note that we have parametrized the splitting @xmath58 between the two levels explicitly since this is the quantity of direct interest .",
    "the basis of the fitting procedure is the estimate of the correlation matrix of results . at any one time",
    "these comprised the two direct and two cross correlators for two operators evaluated on 48 time slices .",
    "the correlation matrix was therefore of dimension @xmath59  .",
    "our data is extracted from 60 independent gauge configurations .",
    "the correlation matrix is therefore of rank @xmath60   and therefore necessarily singular . in practice",
    "the effective rank of the correlation matrix is even less than this since beyond a certain point the eigenvalues become so small their estimation from the data is not reliable .",
    "the least squares fitting procedure and the associated error estimates require the use of the inverse of the correlation matrix .",
    "it is necessary and indeed correct to restrict the inversion of the matrix to an appropriate subspace that is spanned by eigenvectors with eigenvalues large enough for reliable estimation from the data .",
    "the dimension of the subspace is referred to as the singular value decomposition ( svd ) cut .    in assessing the results of the fitting procedure we examined cases with a range of values of initial off - set and svd cuts for different combinations of smeared operators .",
    "our criterion for a choice of result was that the @xmath61-value be acceptably near unity per degree of freedom and that the error was the best ( usually the first ) of a range of reasonably good and statistically consistent fits .",
    "before exhibiting the results of the correlated fits we show directly the existence of a second exponential by means of a diagonalization method .",
    "lscher and wolff @xcite have shown that the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix are of the form e^-m_(a)t ( 1 + o(e^-m_(a)t ) )   where @xmath62 is the distance of state @xmath63 from other states .",
    "thus we evaluate the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix using the appropriate numerical recipes routines @xcite .",
    "1 shows the result for @xmath64 for the @xmath10-wave combination @xmath65 and @xmath66   - the ground state @xmath10-wave is suppressed revealing the existence of the exponential associated with the first excited state .",
    "2 shows effective mass plots for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states obtained from these graphs .",
    "3  &  4 show similar results for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 states .",
    "the results are reasonably consistent with those of the correlated fits discussed below which were used to produce the quoted numbers .    in order to obtain reasonably smooth plots",
    "the effective mass was defined as m(t)=0.25 * ( )  , where a(t)=(f(t)+wf(t+1)+w^2f(t+4)+w^3f(t+3))/4  , and @xmath71 is chosen to render the terms in the sum of comparable size .",
    "the results of the correlated fits are shown in table 1  .",
    "also shown are the operators used to obtain the results , the @xmath61 per degree of freedom , the svd - cuts and the off - sets at which a reasonable statistical stability set in .",
    ".the results for the ground states and first excited splits in the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 channels . [ cols=\"^,^,<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results are not dissimilar to those of the phenomenological non - relativistic quark models @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is relatively independent of the bare quark mass though the @xmath68 state is rather high .",
    "apart from the anomalously high @xmath68 state the ratios that fit best correspond to a bare quark mass somewhere between @xmath72 and @xmath73  . using the same conversion factor",
    "as above we find these correspond to @xmath74 gev and @xmath75 gev .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath76-quark mass of @xmath77 gev suggested by the mass of the @xmath4 itself .",
    "if we take the @xmath78 mass split for @xmath79 as the correct basis on which to calculate then we find @xmath80 gev which encompasses the above value .",
    "our results for @xmath81 are higher than suggested by a measurement of the string tension @xmath82  . at @xmath14 , @xmath83 @xcite that is @xmath84  .",
    "if we use the phenomenological value @xmath85 gev we obtain @xmath86 gev .",
    "this is in line with other estimates of @xmath81 .",
    "another way of expressing this discrepancy is to note that our lattice calculation at @xmath14 yields a ratio @xmath87 whereas the phenomenological result is @xmath88  .",
    "the question then is whether or not there is a reasonable explanation of this discrepancy for our model .",
    "one answer is to recognize that the string tension is associated with the long range part of the quark potential while the @xmath78 split comes about as a result of a balance between long and short range effects in the potential .",
    "the short range force is controlled by the strong coupling evaluated at a higher momentum , @xmath89 , than that , @xmath90 , associated with the string tension .",
    "the main difference between the quenched and unquenched theories is the differential renormalization of the strong coupling @xmath91 at a given @xmath92 due to the vacuum polarization effects of light quarks .",
    "if we fix the string tension to be the same in both theories then we have @xmath93 however because the quenched coupling runs faster than the unquenched one we have @xmath94  .",
    "the short range force in the quenched theory will therefore be weaker than in the unquenched case . because the @xmath10-wave states are particularly sensitive to the short range part of the @xmath95 force they will be more deeply bound in the unquenched theory than in the quenched one .",
    "the @xmath11-waves will be controlled more by the longer range part of the force associated with the string tension .",
    "this will tend to leave the @xmath11-waves unchanged between the two theories with the result that for a given string tension @xmath96 will be greater in the unquenched relative to the quenched theory . in turn",
    "this will yield a lower value for the ratio @xmath97 for the unquenched relative to the quenched theory in line with our results .",
    "similar results will hold for for any two quantities associated with different momentum scales . in the quenched theory they will yield different estimates for @xmath81 while unquenched theory ( by definition )",
    "will produce consistent estimates .",
    "in table 4 we show the results for a two exponential fit to the two versions of the @xmath7 wave operators for the bare quark mass @xmath72  .",
    "m + 1.5 & @xmath5 & 1.373(11)&0.315(13)&23.7/18&26&6&2 and 6 + & @xmath6 & 1.388(19)&0.389(41)&22.5/14&22&6&1 and 4 +    the encouraging feature of these results is the degeneracy within errors not only of the basic states in the two channels but also of the first excited states .",
    "the conclusion is that to a good approximation the cubical symmetry of the ( spatial ) lattice is replaced by rotatational symmetry .",
    "expressed in physical units @xmath98 gev if we again use @xmath3 gev . there is so far no observed @xmath7 wave for the @xmath4 system but the corresponding state for charmonium ( @xmath8 ) has @xmath99 gev .",
    "given the simple and approximate nature of our heavy quark hamilton this is an encouraging result .",
    "the quality of the results from the simulation restricted the application of the fitting procedure to the range @xmath100 so the outcome for the mass gap may be expected to be on the high side .",
    "this circumstance may also explain why the measured gap @xmath101 1 gev is implausibly high .",
    "it is interesting that it showed in both versions of the @xmath7 wave spectrum .",
    "we have measured the @xmath0 mass splittings for the radial excitations of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 waves using the non - relativistic heavy quark propagators calculated from quenched gluon configurations from the ukqcd collaboration .",
    "our measurements were based on 60 qcd configurations on a @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian we used to calculate the quark propagators was of the simplest kind containing only the kinetic energy contribution and omitting all higher corrections .",
    "the results emerged from two - exponential correlated fits to pairs of smeared operator correlators .",
    "our best results yielded statistical errors @xmath102 for the mass splittings .    on a broad picture our results are not inconsistent with the pattern of spin - averaged splittings of the @xmath4-system .",
    "in particular the ratios @xmath103 seem roughly correct .",
    "the @xmath70 wave shows a slight dependence on the bare quark mass .",
    "we have not yet determined the dependence of the @xmath104 wave on this mass .",
    "the absence of an experimental @xmath104 state for @xmath4 restricts us to a comparison with the corresponding charmonium state or theoretical quark model predictions but that comparison is encouraging .",
    "if we base our evaluation of the cut - off strictly on the @xmath78 mass split then we find the value @xmath105 gev .",
    "this very much in line with scaling predictions from results of the corresponding calculations performed at values of @xmath1065.7 and 6.0 @xcite  . this suggested a bare quark mass for the kinetic energy hamiltonian in the range 4.8 to 6.4 gev .",
    "however there are two obvious problems that present themselves .",
    "the first is that the ratio involving the string tension @xmath97 is measured as 1.25 compared to a phenomenological value of 1.0  .",
    "it is plausible that this discrepancy may be due to the overly strong running of the coupling in the quenched theory .",
    "the second is the anomalously high value of @xmath107 and its sensitivity to the bare quark mass .",
    "it may be that the deficiencies of the quenched approximation can resolve this problem also .",
    "an alternative explanation is that there is a measurement problem with the @xmath10 wave channel .",
    "future measurements using different smeared operators constructed in the coulomb gauge from quark model wave functions should help to resolve the issue .",
