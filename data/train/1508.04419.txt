    "the topic of fractional calculus ( that is , the study of integrals and derivatives of non - integer order ) is nowadays a growing interest area of mathematics .",
    "moreover , physicists and engineers are also really interested in applications coming from this nice theory which origin goes back to the theory of differential calculus ; more precisely to leibniz s famous note in his letter to lhpital dated 30 september 1695 .    for a long time , the theory of fractional calculus developed only as a theoretical field of mathematics .",
    "however , in the last decades , it was shown that some fractional operators describe in a better way some complex physical phenomena , especially when dealing with memory processes or viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials .",
    "well known references about the application of fractional operators in rheology modeling are @xcite .",
    "one of the most important advantage of fractional order models in comparison with integer order ones is that fractional integrals and derivatives are a powerful tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties of some materials .",
    "notice that integer order derivatives are local operators , but the fractional order derivative of a function in a point depends on the past values of such function .",
    "this features motivated the successful use of fractional calculus in crone @xcite and pid controllers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) .    due to this , in the last two or three decades , a great interest has been devoted to the study of fractional differential equations .",
    "thus , fractional order differential equations ( one day called extraordinary differential equations ) play today a very important role describing some real world phenomena . for a complete exposition of the theory of fractional calculus one can see @xcite .",
    "the exponential function , @xmath0 , plays a fundamental role in mathematics and it is really useful in the theory of integer order differential equations . in the case of fractional order , it loses some beautiful properties and mittag - leffler function appears as its natural substitute .",
    "next , we recall its definition and some basic properties .",
    "the function @xmath1 is named after the great swedish mathematician gsta mittag - leffler ( 1846 - 1927 ) who defined it as a power series given by @xmath2    this function provides a simple generalization of the exponential function because of the replacement of @xmath3 by @xmath4 in the denominator of the terms of the exponential series . due to this , such function can be considered the simplest nontrivial generalization of exponential function .",
    "a two parameter function of mittag - leffler type is defined by @xmath5    during the first half of the twntieth century , the mittag - leffler functions remained almost unkonown to the majority of the mathematicians . however",
    ", recently attention of mathematicians and other scientists towards functions of mittag - leffler type has increased and today some mathematicians like to refer the classical mittag - leffler function as the _ queen function _ of fractional calculus , and to consider all related functions as her court .",
    "recently , a complete monograph ( see @xcite ) about mittag - leffler functions and its several applications has been published .",
    "more information about this kind of special functions ans its relations with fractional calculus can be found in @xcite .",
    "it follows from previous definitions that , for instance ,    @xmath6    which proves the importance of mittag - leffler functions in mathematics .",
    "furthermore , using the following well known result @xmath7\\,(t)=t^{b-\\alpha}\\dfrac{\\gamma(b+1)}{\\gamma(b+1-\\alpha)},\\qquad",
    "b>-1,\\,b\\neq 0,\\ ] ] we can easily see that @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , is a nontrivial eigenfunction for caputo fractional derivative operator ( previously denoted by @xmath10 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.4 ) ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath11 for @xmath12 then @xmath13    in the past , some authors used to derived some results the following _ property _ of mittag - leffler function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a real constant .",
    "unfortunately , such property is unavailable unless @xmath16 or @xmath17 , both of them are trivial situations , since we obtain exponential function in the first case , and a constant function secondly . for more information about the invalidity of such equality we refer to @xcite .    in this note",
    "we discuss a similar property related again with mittag - leffler function and using such property , we conclude that the function introduced in @xcite is not an exact solution for the fractional logistic equation .",
    "it may be obvious , but nevertheless mittag - leffler function shares some analogue properties with exponential function , these kind of results show that exponential function can not be replaced , in general , by mittag - leffler function in the theory of fractional calculus .",
    "in 1838 , p.  f.  verhulst introduced a nonlinear term into the rate equation ; he was studying population models and he wanted to avoid the catastrophic predictions previously proposed by t.  malthus , who had used the rate equation to model human population growth ( for historical references see @xcite ) . by this way",
    ", p.  f.  verhulst obtained what today is known as the logistic equation : @xmath18 this differential equation is one of the few nonlinear differential equations that has a known exact closed form solution , which is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the initial state ( that is , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total population at the initial time and @xmath23 is the carrying capacity of the ecosystem ) .",
    "since that time , the logistic equation has found several applications ranging from machine learning to modeling growth of tumors .",
    "fractional logistic equation has been studied , see for instance @xcite ; but until now no exact is known .",
    "recently , bruce j. west has published a research paper ( see @xcite ) where , using the carleman embeding technique , he proposes an exact solution for the fractional logistic equation . more concretely , in such reference it is said that the function given by @xmath24 may be an exact solution of the fractional differential equation @xmath25    of course , following @xcite , notice that if @xmath16 then function given in ( [ ec:3 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath26 which coincides with ( [ ec:2 ] ) .",
    "that is , if in ( [ ec:3 ] ) @xmath16 , then we obtain the solution of the integer order logistic equation ( [ ec:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , fractional solutions given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) have similar properties to integer order solution given by ( [ ec:2 ] ) .",
    "since carleman embedding technique was introduced to solve integer order differential equations , not fractional order differential equations , the author of @xcite warms us about the necessity to validate solution of ( [ ec:4 ] ) given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) .",
    "this is the main objective of this short note .    in what follows",
    ", we assume that function given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) is an exact solution of the fractional differential equation ( [ ec:4 ] ) .",
    "[ l:2.1 ] if the function given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) is an exact solution of fractional logistic equation ( [ ec:4 ] ) of order @xmath27 , then for all @xmath28 we have that @xmath29    consider for each @xmath30 @xmath31 thus , function given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) can be written as @xmath32 moreover , given @xmath27 , we have that @xmath33\\,(t)=-k^\\alpha\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\dfrac{u_0 - 1}{u_0}\\right)^nn e_\\alpha(-nk^\\alpha s^\\alpha),\\ ] ] and using the cauchy product , we obtain :    @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath35 is a solution of equation ( [ ec:4 ] ) , we deduce that for all @xmath28 it must be @xmath36 which is the equality given in the statement of the lemma .",
    "[ p:2.2 ] in the condition of lemma [ l:2.1 ] , we have that @xmath37    considering @xmath38 in equality ( [ ec:5 ] ) , we obtain the desired result .    [ p:2.3 ] identity ( [ ec:6 ] ) of proposition [ p:2.2 ] holds if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "by definition of the mittag - leffler function we have that , @xmath39 moreover , using the cauchy product , we obtain : @xmath40 where @xmath41 equality ( [ ec:6 ] ) implies that coefficents of series expansions ( [ ec:7 ] ) and ( [ ec:8 ] ) must be equal .",
    "particularly , if we choose @xmath38 , we must have @xmath42 or equivalently , @xmath43 since if @xmath44 then @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it is clear that equality in ( [ ec:9 ] ) holds if and only if @xmath16 .    from proposition [ p:2.3 ] , it is clear that function given by ( [ ec:3 ] ) is a solution of differential equation ( [ ec:4 ] ) if and only if @xmath16 , but in such case , we have an integer order differential equation and function defined by ( [ ec:3 ] ) coincides with the solution of such differential equation .    notice also that since when @xmath16 then @xmath47 , identities ( [ ec:5 ] ) and ( [ ec:6 ] ) are well known properties .    differentiating in both sides of equation ( [ ec:6 ] ) , we deduce another identity which only holds if @xmath16 , @xmath48    using mathematica @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we can reaffirm analytical results previously obtained . in figure 1",
    "some graphs can be found in this direction .",
