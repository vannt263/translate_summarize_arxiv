    "helium crystals represent a fascinating system in which general properties of crystalline surfaces such as the equilibrium crystal shape , surface phase transitions ( roughening ) and elementary mechanisms of the crystal growth can be studied over a wide temperature @xmath2 range , in principle down to absolute zero .",
    "helium crystals can be grown chemically and isotopically pure , and with very few lattice defects .",
    "helium crystal growth is fast in comparison to that of other solids and it is characterized by the unique -quantum- phenomenon of crystallization waves , i.e. , melting - freezing waves which can easily propagate on the liquid - solid interface at low temperatures .",
    "this allows an accurate measurement of the surface stiffness @xmath3 and surface tension @xmath4 and of their anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the research on the surface of helium crystals has been recently reviewed  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic approach to the study of solid @xmath0he and liquid - solid coexistence at low temperature needs a fully quantum approach .",
    "accurate path integral monte carlo  @xcite ( pimc ) in the 5 - 30 k temperature range and green function monte carlo  @xcite ( gfmc ) calculations on solid @xmath0he have been reported in the past .",
    "more recently , the liquid - solid interface has been adressed within a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) approach using shadow wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "density functional ( df ) methods  @xcite represent a useful computational tool to study the properties of quantum inhomogeneous fluids , especially for large systems where df provides a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost .",
    "indeed , the @xmath5 properties of inhomogeneous liquid @xmath6he can be accurately described within df theory ( dft ) by using the phenomenological functional proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and later improved in ref .",
    "@xcite , and similar ones .",
    "they have been widely used in a variety of problems involving inhomogeneous @xmath6he systems like , e.g. , liquid - vapor interface  @xcite , pure and doped clusters  @xcite , layering and prewetting transitions in films  @xcite , alkali atom adsorption on the surface of liquid @xmath0he and droplets  @xcite , vortices in @xmath0he clusters  @xcite , etc .    in view of its conceptual interest on the one hand , and of the potential applications on the other hand ,",
    "we have undertaken a fully variational study of the liquid - solid transition and coexistence of @xmath0he at zero temperature within dft .",
    "previous attempts on @xmath0he  @xcite or quantum hard spheres  @xcite have been reported .",
    "they adapted the techniques initially designed to address the liquid - solid transition in classical systems ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "they use trial functions ( sums of gaussians ) to parametrize the solid density , and resort to a second - order expansion of the energy around the liquid density ( ramakrishnan - yussouff ( ry ) approach )  @xcite , or to a modified weighted density approximation exact to second order for small perturbations of the liquid  @xcite .",
    "these methods need the density - density static linear response function @xmath7 of the liquid as input . in helium",
    ", these approaches have been found to be , at most , a reasonable starting point to qualitatively describe the freezing transition  @xcite ; moreover , some of these attempts always give the liquid  @xcite or the solid  @xcite as the stable phase .",
    "additional problems arise in treating the liquid - solid interface , because it is found to be too narrow to allow the use of coarse graining methods  @xcite .",
    "besides , the use of trial function density profiles makes all these approaches of limited applicability for systems characterized by the presence of both solid and liquid phases .",
    "we attempt here a _ fully variational _",
    "df description of _ both _ liquid and solid phases on the same footing .",
    "our starting point is a simplified version of the orsay - trento ( ot ) functional  @xcite , where the energy of the @xmath0he system is written as    @xmath8= & & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\int d{\\bf r } \\left ( \\nabla \\sqrt{\\rho}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d{\\bf r } \\ , d{\\bf r}'\\rho ( { \\bf r } ) \\rho",
    "( { \\bf r}')v_\\mathrm{lj}(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|)\\nonumber\\\\ + & & \\frac{c_2}{2}\\int d{\\bf r}\\rho ( { \\bf r})\\bar{\\rho}^2({\\bf r } ) + \\frac{c_3}{3}\\int d{\\bf r}\\rho ( { \\bf r } ) \\bar{\\rho}^3({\\bf r } ) \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term is the usual quantum kinetic energy term , the second term contains a lennard - jones he - he pair potential @xmath9 screened at distances shorter than a characteristic length @xmath10 . in the third and fourth terms , the weighted density @xmath11 is the average of the density over a sphere of radius @xmath12 .",
    "these terms account phenomenologically for short range correlations .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( in the original formulation , @xmath15 ) are fixed to reproduce the experimental density , energy per atom and compressibility for the liquid at zero temperature and pressure  @xcite .",
    "the original non - local kinetic energy term proportional to @xmath16  @xcite has been dropped , because , as one might expect , it leads to unavoidable instabilities in the solid phase .",
    "its neglecting causes the static response function @xmath7 of the liquid to be only qualitatively described .",
    "we should mention the existence of an alternative parametrization of this term that still reproduces the experimental static function , while being free from instabilities  @xcite . as the resulting df stems from a somewhat different strategy than current df s do , we have preferred to keep using an ot - like functional , introducing the changes mentioned below .    the equilibrium density @xmath17 is obtained by minimizing @xmath18 $ ] with respect to density variations , subject to the constraint of a constant number of @xmath0he atoms @xmath19 .",
    "this is achieved by evolving in the imaginary time a non - linear schrdinger equation for the order parameter @xmath20 , where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the effective potential @xmath22 is defined in terms of the variational derivative of the last three terms in the energy functional eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed in a periodically repeated supercell containing a fixed number of @xmath0he atoms , and the _ starting _ configuration is a superposition of gaussian profiles with arbitrary but small width , placed in the positions of the hcp structure , which is the experimental solid structure of @xmath0he .",
    "interestingly , for average densities corresponding to the stable liquid phase , the equilibrium density obtained is homogeneous , whereas for higher densities -those roughly corresponding to the solid- a solid @xmath0he structure , characterized by a periodic density distribution with helium atoms at the lattice sites of an hcp crystal , is found to be the stable phase .",
    "` solid ' means here a highly inhomogeneous configuration characterized by regions , called ` atoms ' for brevity in the following , where the density is very large .",
    "such atoms are only slightly overlapping with the density tails of neighboring atoms .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the calculated density profile for one such solid structure , computed at the experimental freezing density @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "we have studied other ordered structures as well .",
    "an fcc lattice is also found to be a stable phase at typical solid densities , its energy being only slightly higher than that of the hcp phase ( by @xmath26 k per atom ) . a simple cubic structure , at the same densities ,",
    "is found instead to be unstable towards the homogeneous ( liquid ) phase .",
    "we want to point out that the correct solid structure is found even if the initial gaussian superposition has not the correct parameters .",
    "for instance , we found that by starting with gaussians , placed on a hcp lattice with a lattice constant twice the equilibrium one , but such that the total normalization gives the correct @xmath0he density , the equilibrium hcp structure is eventually recovered at the end of the minimization process .",
    "he density ( @xmath27@xmath25 ) of a @xmath0he hcp crystal , viewed along the c - axis.,width=321 ]    in spite of this encouraging result , a close analysis of the density dependence of the total energy of the hcp solid @xmath0he , calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , shows that it largely deviates from the experimental result .",
    "the reason is an unphysical , large density pile - up in the core region of the @xmath0he atoms , such that the resulting solid is too dense . to fix this unrealistic behavior",
    ", we need a mechanism that makes energetically costly such density pile - up .",
    "the simplest one is to add a ` penalty ' energy term to the functional , which has the following form :    @xmath28=c\\int \\rho ( { \\bf r } ) f[\\rho ( { \\bf r})]\\ , d{\\bf r } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    here @xmath29 $ ] is a ` switch ' function which becomes appreciably different from zero only when the density is larger than a predefined value @xmath30 .",
    "one such function is        @xmath31= 1 + \\tanh \\ { \\beta [ \\rho({\\bf r})-\\rho_\\mathrm{m } ] \\ } \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath30 are df parameters .",
    "the effect of @xmath34 $ ] is to add to the effective potential @xmath35 $ ] the term    @xmath36 + \\beta \\rho ( { \\bf r } ) [ 1- \\tanh^2 [ \\beta ( \\rho ( { \\bf r } ) - \\rho_\\mathrm{m } ) ] \\ } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    if @xmath37 and when @xmath38 , this term acts as a repulsive barrier , which forbids extra pile - up of the density .",
    "we can thus use @xmath32 , @xmath39 , and @xmath30 as adjustable parameters in such a way to get agreement with the experimental equation of state ( eos ) for the solid phase .",
    "note that there is a large freedom in the choice of the penalty term since , by construction , it has no effect whatsoever on the liquid structure , even in a highly structured liquid , because in practice @xmath30 is a factor @xmath40 than typical liquid densities .",
    "we have found that the choice @xmath41 hartree , @xmath42 @xmath43 , and @xmath44 @xmath25  @xcite , yields an eos for the solid in good agreement with experiments  @xcite , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "once the eos of the homogeneous liquid and the eos of the solid are determined , one can easily locate the freezing transition by means of a double - tangent maxwell construction .",
    "we find a freezing pressure @xmath45 bar and a chemical potential at coexistence @xmath46 k. our calculated values for @xmath47 and the solid and liquid densities at coexistence are reported in table [ table1 ] , together with those obtained by other authors .    .freezing transition parameters ( @xmath48  ) .",

    "our scheme does not rely on any specific trial function density profile for the solid phase , but gives an unbiased description of both phases on the same footing .",
