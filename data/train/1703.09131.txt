    "the precise characterization of the gravitational and matter fields on some spatial hypersurface constitutes the initial data problem in numerical relativity @xcite . in this instance , it is possible to identify if there exist interacting black holes and neutrons stars together or not with any other distribution of matter , placing an ideal set up to simulate astrophysical situations in which the high gravitational field plays a central role . in parallel to the decades - long effort to directly detect gravitational radiation which has been accomplished recently @xcite , there has also been an endeavor to predict gravitational wave signals from compact binaries using numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations @xcite start with initial data in general containing binary of black holes    in more precise terms , the initial data problem in general relativity consists in specifying the spatial metric and extrinsic curvature , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , in a given spatial hypersurface .",
    "these quantities must satisfy the constraint equations , namely the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations , that arises from the cauchy formulation of the field equations @xcite .",
    "the most important strategy for solving the constrained equations is to introduce a conformal transformation of the spatial metric to a known background metric , @xmath2 , and a similar transformation involving the extrinsic curvature @xcite .",

    "we are going to focus here on the puncture method that consists @xcite in decomposing the conformal factor into two pieces : the background component containing the black holes singularities and usually given analytically , and the regular component which is obtained by solving the hamiltonian constraint numerically .",

    "it has been shown that the schwarzschild wormhole puncture data evolves in such a way the numerical slices tend a spatial slice with finite areal radius or trumpets @xcite .",

    "we have presented the numerical tests and discussed some cases of interest in section 4 . in particular , we highlighted the proposed unified description of single trumpet spinning and trumped black hole .",
    "for a single spinning black hole , we have shown the influence of the spin in altering the minimal surface from a sphere to an oblate spheroid .",
    "we have also considered wormhole and trumpet binaries to illustrate the feasibility of the algorithm in more general cases . finally , in section 5 we have concluded and traced some directions of the present investigation .",
    "the starting point to construct maximal sliced puncture trumpet initial data is to establish the trumpet slicing of the schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "the main reason of not adopting the usual decomposition for the conformal factor ( eq .",
