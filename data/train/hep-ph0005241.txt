    "the loop expansion of a massless theory suffers from severe infrared divergencies .",

    "the dimensionful parameter @xmath14 plays a role similar to the @xmath15 scale .",
    "since @xmath4 is a super - renormalizable theory , the running of the coupling should be understood as a wilsonian rather than gell - mann - low type , and it is not associated with ultraviolet divergencies .    by studying the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation for the fermion self - energy in leading order of the @xmath0 expansion , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a phase transition occurs when the coupling at the ir fixed point exceeds some critical value ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this means there exists a critical number of fermions @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) below which dynamical mass generation takes place and above which the fermions remain massless .",
    "this is similar to what happens in quenched @xmath19 @xcite , where the gauge coupling must exceed a critical value for chiral symmetry breaking to occur .",
    "the appearance of a dimensionless critical coupling can be traced to the scale invariant behavior of both theories .",
    "the scale invariance of @xmath4 is associated with the ir fixed point , since , as is evident from eq .",

    "is the fact that the chiral symmetry breaking phase transition in both theories belongs to a special universality class called conformal phase transition ( cpt ) introduced in ref .",
    "it is characterized by a scaling function having an essential singularity at the transition point , and by abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations as the critical point is crossed ( for details about the cpt in @xmath4 see ref .",

    "the presence of a critical @xmath17 in @xmath4 is intriguing especially because of possible existence of an analogous critical fermion number @xmath20 in @xmath21-dimensional su@xmath22 gauge theories , as is suggested by both analytical studies @xcite and lattice computer simulations @xcite .",
    "also , a nontrivial ir fixed point in @xmath4 may be related to nonperturbative dynamics in condensed matter , in particular , dynamics of non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "the fact that the value of the ir fixed point determines the critical @xmath17 , below which the system is in the symmetry broken phase , and that this critical value is found to be of order @xmath23 provides motivation for searches beyond the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "it is especially important because there is still controversy concerning the existence of finite @xmath17 in @xmath4 ; some authors argue that the generation of a fermion mass occurs at all values of @xmath1 @xcite what might mean the absence of the ir fixed point for the running coupling .",

    "@xcite in addition to the fact that studies of @xmath25 corrections to the gap equation showed the increase of the critical value ( @xmath26 ) @xcite , the situation is far from being conclusive .",
    "what we need is some kind of self - consistent equation for the running coupling which is to be solved nonperturbatively .    in the present paper",
    "we study such a nonlinear equation for the running coupling which is the analogue of the ladder approximation for the fermion propagator .",
    "similar to the gap equation , the kernel is taken in the @xmath0 approximation , where it is nothing else as the one - loop photon - photon scattering amplitude with zero momentum transfer .",
    "the equation obtained is obviously gauge invariant .",
    "we then study our equation both analytically and numerically .",
    "we find that the vacuum polarization operator , obtained as a nonperturbative solution of the equation , has the same infrared asymptotics as the one - loop expression : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "thus a nontrivial ir fixed point persists in the nonperturbative solution .",
    "moreover , the correction to the one - loop result ( @xmath29 ) is small even at @xmath30 due to smallness of the numerical coefficient before @xmath0 , that explains why the leading order in the @xmath0 expansion ( the one - loop approximation ) for the vacuum polarization works so well .",
    "further we proceed to studying @xmath4 with additional four - fermion interactions ( the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( gnjl ) model ) .",
    "such kind of models are considered to be effective theories at long distances in planar condensed matter physics , in particular , for high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the improved ladder approximation ( with the photon propagator including fermion one - loop effects ) this model has a nontrivial phase structure @xcite in the coupling constant plane @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the dimensionless four - fermion coupling ( @xmath33 is the ultraviolet cutoff ) .",

    "the spectrum of such a theory contains pseudoscalar ( @xmath45 ) and scalar ( @xmath46 ) bound states which become light in the vicinity of the critical line . since the phase transition is second order along the @xmath35 part eq .",

    "the @xmath45 boson can be viewed as a goldstone boson precursor mode that comes down in energy as the transition is approached .",

    "we might get a hint of any nonanalytic behavior in @xmath0 which would be lost otherwise . at first glance , this way of solving a truncated system of sd equations ignores possible nonanalyticity in @xmath0 coming from the fermion wave function and the vertex ( related , for example , to the power - law behavior due to an anomalous dimension ) .",
    "note , however , that the fermion propagator is a gauge dependent quantity , thus possible power - law behavior of the fermion wave function must cancel the corresponding behavior coming from the longitudinal part of the vertex ( recall that we consider in this paper the symmetric ( massless ) phase only ) .",
    "therefore the only nonanalyticity we have neglected is the one which might be present in the transverse part of the vertex beyond order @xmath0 . neglecting possible nonanalyticity in the transverse vertex means that we are seeking for nonanaliticity originating from the nonlinear equation for the photon propagator only .",
