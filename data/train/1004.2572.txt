    "in recent years , @xmath2 dimensional , banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) @xcite black hole has attracted much attention .",
    "one of the basic reasons for this attraction is that the btz black hole has a relatively simple tractable mathematical structure so that it provides a better understanding of investigating the general aspects of black hole physics since the btz black hole carries all the characteristic features such as the event horizon and hawking radiation , it can be treated as a real black hole . another motivation to study",
    "btz black hole is the ads / cft correspondence which relates thermal properties of black holes in the ads space to a dual cft . in view of these points , the unresolved black hole properties belonging to @xmath3 or higher dimensional black holes at the quantum level ,",
    "make the btz black hole an excellent background for exploring the black hole physics .",
    "another interesting subject is the study of naked singularities that can be considered as a threat to the cosmic censorship hypothesis . compared to the black holes ,",
    "the naked singularities are less understood . today , there is no common consensus either on the structure or the existence of the naked singularities .",
    "recently , pitelli and letelier ( pl ) @xcite have analysed the occurrence of naked singularities for the btz spacetime from quantum mechanical point of view . in their analysis ,",
    "the criteria proposed by horowitz and marolf ( hm ) @xcite is used .",
    "the classical naked singularity is studied with the quantum test particles that obey klein - gordon and dirac equations .",
    "they confirmed that the naked singularity is `` healed '' when tested by massless scalar particles or fermions without introducing extra boundary conditions .",
    "however , for massive scalar particles additional information is needed .",
    "despite the recent developments on the concept of quantum singularities hk , our understanding of naked singularities as far as quantum gravity concerned is still far from being complete .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the naked singularities within the context of the quantum mechanics that form in the matter coupled @xmath4 dimensional black hole spacetimes .",
    "our motivation here is to investigate the effect of the matter fields on the quantum singularity structure of the btz spacetime because the surface at @xmath1 for the btz black hole is not a curvature singularity , but is a singularity in the causal structure .",
    "this situation changes when a matter field is coupled .",
    "this is precisely the case that we shall elaborate on in this article . for this purpose",
    "we consider the charged btz spacetime both in linear and non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "this is analogous to a kind of einstein - maxwell extension of the work presented in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we extend the analysis to cover @xmath4 dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton coupled black hole spacetime .",
    "the presence of charge both in linear and non - linear case and also the dilaton field modify the resulting spacetime geometry significantly . near the origin , the spacetime is not conic and true curvature singularity develops at @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the spacetime geometry that we have investigated in this study differs when compared with the case considered in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first review the definition of quantum singularities for general static spacetimes . in section iii ,",
    "we consider the charged btz black hole in non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "klein - gordon and dirac fields are used to test the quantum singularity .",
    "we also discuss the sobolev norm which is used first time in this context by ishibashi and hosoya @xcite . in sections",
    "iv and v , we consider charged btz in linear electrodynamics and dilaton coupled @xmath0 black hole spacetime in the einstein - maxwell and einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , respectively .",
    "dirac and scalar fields are used to judge the quantum singularity .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion in section vi .",
    "in classical general relativity , the spacetime is said to be singular if the evolution of timelike or null geodesics is not defined after a proper time . horowitz and marolf ,  based on the pioneering work of wald @xcite ,",
    "have proposed the criteria to test the classical singularities with quantum test particles that obey the klein - gordon equation for static spacetime having timelike singularities . according to this criteria ,",
    "the singular character of the spacetime is defined as the ambiguity in the evolution of the wave functions .",
    "that is to say , the singular character is determined in terms of the ambiguity when attempting to find self - adjoint extension of the operator to the entire space .",
    "if the extension is unique , it is said that the space is quantum mechanically regular .",
    "the brief review is as follows :    consider a static spacetime @xmath5  with a timelike killing vector field @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the killing parameter and @xmath8  denote a static slice.the klein - gordon equation on this space is    @xmath9    this equation can be written in the form of    @xmath10    in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the spatial covariant derivative on @xmath13 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath14  is the space of square integrable functions on @xmath13 .",
    "the domain of the operator @xmath15 @xmath16 is taken in such a way that it does not enclose the spacetime singularities .",
    "an appropriate set is @xmath17 , the set of smooth functions with compact support on @xmath13 .",
    "operator @xmath18 is real , positive and symmetric therefore its self - adjoint extensions always exist .",
    "if  it has a unique extension @xmath19 then @xmath18 is called essentially self - adjoint @xcite . accordingly , the klein - gordon equation for a free particle satisfies    @xmath20    with the solution    @xmath21 \\psi\\left ( 0\\right ) .\\ ] ]    if @xmath18 is not essentially self - adjoint , the future time evolution of the wave function ( eq . ( 4 ) ) is ambiguous .",
    "then , horowitz and marolf define the spacetime quantum mechanically singular .",
    "however , if there is only one self - adjoint extension , the operator @xmath18 is said to be  essentially self - adjoint and the quantum evolution described by eq.(4 ) is uniquely determined by the initial conditions . according to the horowitz and marolf criterion",
    ", this spacetime is said to be quantum mechanically nonsingular . in order to determine the number of self - adjoint extensions , the concept of deficiency indices is used .",
    "the deficiency subspaces @xmath22 are defined by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed mathematical background ) ,    @xmath23    the dimensions @xmath24 are the deficiency indices of the operator @xmath18",
    ". the indices @xmath25 are completely independent of the choice of @xmath26 depending only on whether @xmath27 lies in the upper ( lower ) half complex plane .",
    "generally one takes @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an arbitrary positive constant necessary for dimensional reasons .",
    "the determination of deficiency indices then reduces to counting the number of solutions of @xmath31 ; ( for @xmath32 ) ,    @xmath33    that belong to the hilbert space @xmath34 . if there is no square integrable solutions ( i.e. @xmath35 , the operator a possesses a unique self - adjoint extension and it is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "consequently , a sufficient condition for the operator @xmath18 to be essentially self - adjoint is to investigate the solutions satisfying eq .",
    "( 6 ) that do not belong to the hilbert space .",
    "the action describing @xmath36 - dimensional einstein theory coupled with non - linear electrodynamics is given by @xcite ,    @xmath37    the field equations via variational principle read as ,    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    in which @xmath41 stands for the derivative of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "the non - linear field is chosen so that the energy momentum tensor ( 9 ) has a vanishing trace .",
    "the trace of the tensor gives ,    @xmath44    hence , to have a vanishing trace , the electromagnetic lagrangian is obtained as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is an integration constant . with reference to the paper @xcite , the complete solution to the above action is given by the metric ,    @xmath47    where the metric function @xmath48 is given by ,    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the mass , @xmath51 the case @xmath52 @xmath53 , that corresponds with an asymptotically de - sitter ( anti de - sitter ) spacetime , and @xmath54 is the electric charge .",
    "this metric represents the btz spacetime in non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "if @xmath55 , we have an asymptotically flat solution coupled with coulomb - like field . the kretschmann scalar which indicates the occurrence of curvature singularity is given by ,    @xmath56    in which @xmath57",
    "it is clear that @xmath1 is a typical central curvature singularity . according to the values of @xmath58  , @xmath59 and @xmath54",
    ", this singularity may be clothed by single or double horizons .",
    "( see the reference @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , for specific values of @xmath58  , @xmath59 and @xmath54 the central curvature singularity becomes  naked and it deserves to be investigated within the framework of quantum mechanics . to find the condition for naked singularities the metric function is written in the following form ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 since the range of coordinate @xmath63 varies from 0 to infinity , the negative root will indicate the condition for a naked singularity . in order to find the roots",
    ", we set @xmath64 which yields @xmath65 the standard procedure is followed for a solution via a new variable defined by @xmath66 that transforms the equation to @xmath67 this equation can be solved easily and the final answer is    @xmath68    in which @xmath69 with a constraint condition @xmath70 after some algebra , we end up with the following equation    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 it can be verified easily that the expression inside the curly bracket in eq . ( 18 ) is always positive .",
    "hence , the only possibility for a negative root is @xmath74 .",
    "this implies @xmath75 therefore , the condition @xmath76 is imposed from the constraint condition . as a result , for a naked singularity , @xmath77 or @xmath78 should be satisfied .",
    "our aim now is to investigate the quantum singularity structure of the naked singularity that may arise if the constant coefficients satisfy @xmath79      using seperation of variables , @xmath80 , we obtain the radial portion of eq .",
    "( 6 ) as    @xmath81    where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "the coulomb - like field in metric function ( 14 ) becomes negligibly small and hence , the metric takes the form    @xmath83    this particular case overlaps with the results already reported in @xcite .",
    "hence , no new result arises for this particular case .",
    "this is expected because the effect of source term vanishes for large values of @xmath63 .",
    "the case near origin is topologically different compared to the analysis reported in @xcite . here",
    ", the spacetime is not conic .",
    "the approximate metric near origin is given by ,    @xmath85    this metric can also be interpreted as the @xmath4 dimensional topological schwarzchild - like black hole geometry .    for the solution of the radial equation ( 19 ) , we assume that a massless case ( i.e. @xmath86 ) , and ignore the term @xmath87 ( since it is negligible near the origin )",
    ". then it takes the form ,    @xmath88    whose solution is    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the first and second kind modified bessel functions and @xmath92 the behaviour of the modified bessel functions for real @xmath93 as @xmath94 are given by ;    @xmath95 , \\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ } \\nu=0}{\\frac{\\gamma\\left ( \\nu\\right ) } { 2}% \\left ( \\frac{2}{x}\\right ) ^{\\nu},\\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ } % \\nu\\text{\\ } \\neq0 } ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xmath98 checking for the square integrability of the solution ( 23 ) requires the behaviour of the integral for @xmath90 @xmath99 and @xmath100 which are both convergent as @xmath94 .",
    "any linear combination is also square integrable .",
    "it follows the solution ( 23 ) belonging to the hilbert space @xmath34 and therefore the operator @xmath18 described in eq.(6 ) is not essentially self - adjoint .",
    "so , the naked singularity at  @xmath1 is quantum mechanically singular if it is probed with quantum particles .",
    "another approach to remove the quantum singularity is to choose the function space to be the sobolev space @xmath101 which is used first time in this context by ishibashi and hosoya @xcite . here",
    ", the function space is defined by @xmath102 where the norm defined in @xmath4 dimensional geometry as ,    @xmath103    which involves both the wave function and its derivative to be square integrable .",
    "the failure in the square integrability indicates that the operator @xmath18 is essentially self - adjoint and thus , the spacetime is `` wave regular '' . according to this norm , the first integral is square integrable while the second integral behaves for the functions @xmath90 as @xmath104 and @xmath91 integral vanishes . as a result ,",
    "the wave functions are square integrable and thus the spacetime is quantum mechanically wave singular .",
    "it should be noted that the sobolev space is not the natural quantum mechanical hilbert space .",
    "we apply the same methodology as in @xcite for finding a solution to dirac equation .",
    "since the fermions have only one spin polarization in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite , dirac matrices are reduced to pauli matrices @xcite so that ,    @xmath105    where latin indices represent internal ( local ) indices . in this way ,    @xmath106    where @xmath107  is the minkowski metric in @xmath4dimensions and @xmath108  is the identity matrix .",

    "the case of @xmath94 is not conical so there is a topological difference in the spacetime near @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the suitable triads for the metric ( 21 ) are given by ,    @xmath121    the coordinate dependent gamma matrices and the spinorial affine connection are given by    @xmath122    now , for the spinor    @xmath123    the dirac equation can be written as    @xmath124    the following ansatz will be employed for the positive frequency solutions :    @xmath125    the radial parts of the dirac equation for investigating the behaviour as @xmath126 , are    @xmath127    where @xmath128 @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 then , the solutions are given by ;",
