    "a source is considered variable if the variability observed between observations is greater than that expected from poisson statistics , with a probability threshold of 5% that the variability is due to noise alone .",
    "( the choice of probability threshold is discussed further below . ) to check whether a source can be considered variable , we calculate the quantity : + @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of epochs , @xmath61 is the photon flux ( background - subtracted counts with units of @xmath12  s@xmath13 ) in a given epoch , @xmath35 is the mean photon flux over all epochs , and @xmath62 is the error squared on the photon flux for the @xmath63 epoch .",
    "the photon flux is calculated by dividing the full - band ( 0.58.0 kev ) net counts by the exposure time and the mean effective area across the source aperture .",
    "the @xcite approximation gives the error on the net counts , which is propagated to obtain the error on the photon flux .",
    "since this error is significantly asymmetric for low - count ( @xmath64 counts ) sources , we average the upward and downward error bars for these objects to obtain the average error @xmath65 .",
    "( the same method is applied in the monte carlo simulations below . ) for large photon fluxes , the @xmath66 statistic follows a @xmath67 distribution , and any source with @xmath66 @xmath58 7.82 ( for 3 degrees of freedom ) has a probability @xmath68 @xmath22 0.05 ( i.e. , 95% confidence level ) that the variability is due to random noise .",
    "however , at low count rates , the error on the photon flux is not gaussian . since errors in the low - count regime are larger than expected from a gaussian distribution , the resulting @xmath66 statistic is smaller than expected and does not follow the @xmath67 distribution ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore constructed a monte carlo simulation to determine the distribution the @xmath66 statistic should follow for each source , similar to the procedure followed by @xcite .",
    "we first scaled the total observed source and background counts for each source , obtained from the full 4 ms observation , to the exposure time and effective area for a given epoch .",
    "this procedure generates the source and background counts expected in each epoch if the source and background were constant over time , and it accounts for fluctuations in the background that will affect low - count sources . to simulate the variance expected from noise , poisson distributions",
    "were defined using the expected source and background counts as the mean values .",
    "we then simulated 1,000 observations of each source by repeatedly drawing the expected counts from the poisson distributions .",
    "for each simulated observation , we calculated the photon flux for four epochs and calculated @xmath66 as defined above .",
    "asymmetric errors on the source and background counts are obtained from @xcite and are propagated to get the error on the photon flux .",
    "the observed @xmath66 can then be compared to the simulated distribution to determine the probability @xmath68 that the observed variability is due to poisson noise .",
    "spurious sources of variability are negligible , since effective exposure maps are calculated separately for each observation , taking into account issues such as vignetting , ccd gaps , bad pixels , bad columns , and _",
    "s spatial- and time - dependent quantum efficiency degradation .",
    "while using a more conservative @xmath69 = 1% on our dataset would result in fewer false positives , it would also eliminate a similar number of truly varying sources .",
    "for example , in the sample of 92 galaxies , @xmath69 = 5% results in 20 variable sources ( see  [ sec : var ] ) , of which 4.6 are expected to be false positives . reducing @xmath69 to 1% results in 13 variable sources ,",
    "of which 0.9 is expected to be a false positive .",

    "several variable galaxies , however , are not bulge - dominated ( nine are late - type ; see table 2 ) , so their black hole masses may be overestimated .",
    "we apply a luminosity - dependent bolometric correction ( @xmath168 ) to estimate the bolometric luminosity @xcite and calculate the eddington ratio ( @xmath169/@xmath5 @xmath29 [ @xmath168 @xmath159]/[@xmath171  ( @xmath162/@xmath121 ) ] ) .",
    "note , that the @xcite correction is calculated explicitly for @xmath159 @xmath58 10@xmath75  ergs  s@xmath13 ; we extrapolate this relation down to the lower luminosities of the variable galaxy sample .",
    "both the @xmath162 and @xmath169 estimation techniques are known to have large dispersions .",
    "the @xmath162-@xmath172 scaling relation has a total scatter of 0.33 dex , and additional uncertainty will come from the luminosity - dependent correction for nuclear emission , which is based on template seds @xcite .",
    "in addition , the assumption that all the variable galaxies are bulge - dominated will produce additional scatter .",
    "the bolometric correction , too , has large scatter due to the intrinsic dispersion in the sed .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath169 due to sed dispersion is @xmath020% for luminous agn @xcite .",
    "there is some debate regarding the similarity between the seds of llagn and luminous agn ( e.g. ,  [ sec : intro ] ; ho 1999 and ho 2002 vs. maoz et al . 2007 ) ; however , the luminous agn sed dispersion likely serves as a lower limit to dispersion in llagn seds .",
    "variable galaxies tend to have lower accretion rates ( @xmath173 = 4 @xmath6 10@xmath174 ) and masses ( @xmath175@xmath176 ) than variable agn ( @xmath173 = 9 @xmath6 10@xmath177 ; @xmath175@xmath178 ) , where we have limited the agn sample to @xmath33  @xmath22  1 for purposes of comparison .",

    "the properties of variable agn and galaxies are consistent with the range of estimates made by @xcite for selected , @xmath33 @xmath22 1 agn in the 1 ms , which span @xmath164  @xmath0  10@xmath180 ( median @xmath3 0.001 ) and @xmath181 ( median @xmath3 @xmath182 @xmath105 ) .    unlike previous studies @xcite",
    ", we find no significant ( anti-)correlation between @xmath158 and @xmath162 , most likely due to the large scatter in @xmath158 and @xmath162 measurements , combined with the narrow range of masses probed ( since most sources lie between @xmath162 @xmath0 10@xmath18310@xmath184 @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that we find a significant anti - correlation between @xmath158 and @xmath164 ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 ) , plotted in figure [ fig : mdot ] , which is likely an artefact of the @xmath158@xmath42 anti - correlation .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that in figure  [ fig : mdot ] the variable galaxies ( black circles ) connect smoothly with the more luminous agn ( red circles ) , with no discrepancy in variability strength .",
    "this suggests that the factor of 22.5 difference in @xmath164 may explain the `` suppressed '' variability in variable galaxies .",
    "a number of recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that variability may be determined by a combination of @xmath162 and @xmath164 , explaining the observed variability - luminosity relation .",
    "agn light curves appear to be universally described by a broken power - law psd function , where the break frequency depends on mass and accretion rate : @xmath187(@xmath162/@xmath188)@xmath13 , where @xmath189 is the accretion efficiency , assumed to be @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the excess variance is equivalent to the integral of the psd between the minimum and maximum frequencies sampled by the data , so as long as the break frequency falls within this range , the excess variance at a given luminosity will decrease with increasing @xmath162 and increase with increasing @xmath164 .",
    "we compare the @xmath162 and @xmath164 values estimated in ",
    "[ sec : suppressed ] to the variability measured for the variable agn and galaxy populations . assuming a universal psd function",
    ", we derive the variability - luminosity relations expected for the sampling pattern , given a range of smbh masses and accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity , which is calculated directly from @xmath162 and @xmath164 , is converted to luminosity via a bolometric correction @xcite . where the break frequency lies outside the timescales sampled by the data ( depending on the combination of @xmath164 and @xmath162 ) ,",
    "the excess variance will remain constant .",
    "the model variability - luminosity relations are plotted in figure  [ fig : sigma_lx_physics ] for the average accretion rates for variable ( @xmath164 = 9 @xmath6 10@xmath177 ; dashed line ) and non - variable ( @xmath164 = 4 @xmath6 10@xmath174 ; dash - dotted line ) galaxies covering @xmath162 = 10@xmath19110@xmath192 @xmath105 ( low to high @xmath42 ) .",
    "both variable populations are limited to @xmath33 @xmath22 1 for comparison , and the relations are calculated at @xmath33 = 0.5 and @xmath33 = 0.7 , the median redshifts for variable galaxies and agn , respectively ; using model redshifts @xmath33 = 0 or 1 resulted in negligible changes .",
    "the shape of the observed variability - luminosity anti - correlation , including the plateau at low luminosity , is roughly reproduced by the model .",
    "the plateau occurs when the break frequency lies outside the range of timescales sampled by the data .",
    "unfortunately , the long timescales ( especially the long _ minimum _ timescale of 4 ms ; see  [ sec : nxsvar ] ) and the large scatter prevent the models from distinguishing between the significantly different accretion rates estimated for variable galaxies and agn .",
    "note that most sources are more variable than predicted by the model .",
    "we note some possible sources of bias : ( 1 ) the normalization of the psd function used to calculate the models is based on a small sample of nearby agn @xcite and may therefore not be representative of agn out to @xmath193 .",
    "( 2 ) both the models and the bias correction applied to the measured excess variance (  [ sec : nxsvar ] ) depend on a universal broken power - law psd function , but the slopes of the psd may vary between individual sources , and some sources may even have a second break at shorter frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( 3 ) peculiar sources , such as nls1s , exhibit higher variability , so the variable sample may suffer from selection effects due to the higher sensitivity to more variable sources (  [ sec : nxsvar ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the variability properties of sources classified as galaxies in the 4 ms by dividing the observations into @xmath31 ms epochs .",
    "we find the following main results :    \\1 .",
    "using a @xmath67-based monte carlo simulation appropriate for low - count sources , 20 of 92 galaxies are selected as variable , as well as 185 of 369 agn .",
    "variability is effective in selecting agn that do not meet other agn selection criteria , such as cuts based on luminosity , -to - optical flux ratio , or excess emission compared to radio emission expected from star - forming galaxies ( see  [ sec : fluxvar ] ) .",
    "if all 20 variable galaxies are accreting smbh , then the commonly used selection criteria employed by @xcite miss 20 of 389 agn ( @xmath35.1% ) , and 19 of 54 llagn ( @xmath335.2% ; where llagn are arbitrarily defined as having @xmath42 @xmath22 10@xmath75 ergs s@xmath13 ) . due to the low counts measured for most galaxies ,",
    "it is likely that some non - variable galaxies may still host an agn but not exhibit detectable variability , so these fractions serve as lower limits .",
    "we measure variability strength with the normalized excess variance , accounting for measurement error , red - noise scatter , and bias due to the sampling pattern . comparing the bias - corrected excess variance to that expected from xrb populations , we find that xrbs can not explain galaxy variability .",
    "galaxy x - ray variability is most likely associated with accretion onto a relatively unobscured smbh . though some absorption may be present ,",
    "the individual and stacked photon indices show no indication of heavy obscuration and are consistent with the typical agn spectral shape ( @xmath53 @xmath0 1.93@xmath540.13 ) .",
    "we confirm a significant anti - correlation between excess variance and luminosity , and find the slope and intercept to be consistent with what is reported in the literature for shorter timescales .",
    "we show that the sampling bias induced by the observing pattern does not affect the anti - correlation slope or significance .",
    "low - luminosity sources ( @xmath42 @xmath22 10@xmath127  ergs  s@xmath13 , largely variable galaxies ) have `` suppressed '' variability compared to the extrapolated linear relation between excess variance and luminosity . this may be explained by their lower accretion rates .",
    "variable galaxies sample a different mass - accretion rate space than the rest of the agn population , with significantly lower accretion rates ( @xmath173 = 4 @xmath6 10@xmath174 ) and masses ( @xmath175@xmath176 ) than variable agn ( @xmath173 = 9 @xmath6 10@xmath177 ; @xmath175@xmath178 ) in the same redshift range ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "we find that an empirical model based on a universal broken power - law psd function , where the break frequency depends on smbh mass and accretion rate , roughly reproduces the shape of the variability - luminosity anti - correlation .",
    "however , the normalization of the model is low compared to the data , suggesting systematic bias either within the data ( e.g. , selection effects ) or the model ( e.g. , incorrect normalization for llagn at @xmath33 @xmath10 1 ) .",
    "we have shown that the variability measured by deep x - ray surveys is an effective technique for selecting cosmologically distant llagn .",
    "extending the to even longer exposures would enable detection of variability in both fainter and less variable sources , thus allowing better characterization of the properties and abundance of the llagn population .",
    "within the 4 ms , smaller time bins could be used to search for variability and better characterize the variability presented here .    in addition , follow - up optical spectroscopy is necessary to characterize the llagn population presented here . while @xcite were able to classify one object as a liner , the spectra for the other sources did not have sufficient signal - to - noise to measure line ratios , so these objects would require either deeper optical spectroscopy or stacking of the currently available spectra .",
