    "in the last twenty years or so , it has undoubtedly been established that entanglement @xcite plays a significant role in efficient quantum communication protocols  @xcite , which include quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite , and in quantum computational tasks like the one - way quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "generation of entanglement in composite systems , requires interaction between its subsystems and hence strongly interacting systems , such as quantum spin chains , form natural resources of entanglement . in the last decade , it has also been realized that entanglement can be used to detect low - temperature phenomena in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "spin models have further been identified as ideal setups for transferring quantum states @xcite as well as for realizing quantum gates , essential parts of quantum circuits and quantum simulators @xcite .",
    "moreover , spin models can be prepared in laboratories via e.g. ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite in a controlled way , and also can be found in materials @xcite .",
    "distribution of entanglement among various parts of a many - body system is important for transmitting information from one party to another within communication computing networks @xcite .",
    "the efforts to understand the sustainability of correlations in many body systems as a function of lattice distance happens to be crucial , since the low - temperature scaling of correlations are expected to remain universal , irrespective of the microscopic details of various materials governed by the same class of underlying models . in case of gapped systems with short - ranged interactions , using the lieb - robinson bounds @xcite , it can be shown that two - site classical correlation functions , @xmath2 , decay exponentially with increasing lattice distance , known as clustering of correlations @xcite except when the systems are critical , when they decay polynomially , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the observables at sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "however , it has been reported that in many cases , quantum correlations , as qualified by entanglement , decays much more rapidly in comparison to classical correlators , both near and far from the quantum critical points .",
    "for example , it was shown that in the quantum @xmath0 model with transverse magnetic field , entanglement can survive only up to the next nearest neighbor @xcite , while in the heisenberg model , it becomes vanishingly small already after the nearest neighbor @xcite .    in recent times , information - theoretic quantum correlation measures , like quantum discord @xcite and quantum work deficit @xcite ,",
    "were introduced which promise to estimate quantum correlations _ beyond _",
    "entanglement @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that there exist instances in which quantum discord is capable of detecting quantum phase transition while pairwise entanglement fails , especially at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to investigate the scaling of these two - site information - theoretic quantum correlation measures in these systems , with increasing distance between the sites . in this respect",
    ", it is already known that unlike entanglement , quantum discord can survive over a longer distance @xcite in the ordered @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "establishing finite correlations between distant parties is undoubtedly important to implement quantum information processing tasks in many body systems . in this paper , we ask the following question : _ is it possible to enhance quantum correlation lengths , namely entanglement and quantum discord lengths , significantly , by introducing defects in quantum spin systems ? _ we find that the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "disorder occurs unavoidably in real materials and can now also be engineered artificially in , e.g. cold atom experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that there exists some models , in which disorder plays a constructive role by enhancing physical properties like magnetization , classical correlators , and quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "such phenomena , known as `` order - from - disorder '' or ",
    "disorder - induced order \" , run certainly in contrary to the naive belief that impurity in the systems can have only a debilitating effect .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate quantum correlation lengths for the ground states of one - dimensional quenched disordered anisotropic @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin chains .",
    "our results show that although the entanglement lengths can not be improved significantly in these quenched disordered systems , the lengths of information - theoretic quantum correlation measures , can substantially be enhanced in such systems .",
    "such disorder - induced advantages can be seen in quantum @xmath0 spin glass and random field @xmath0 models , where the investigations are carried out with the help of jordan - wigner transformations , and in the @xmath1 spin glass systems , which are handled by using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques .",

    "note that the ordered @xmath0 spin model is exactly solvable and the analytic technique can be used to handle the corresponding disordered model , while the @xmath1 spin model with and without disorder can not be solved analytically .",
    "we also present a brief decription of quenched averaging .",
    "the disorder in the system parameters are taken to be  quenched \" .",
    "that is , we assume that the time scale over which the system dynamics of interest takes place is much smaller compared to the time scale over which there is a change in the particular set of parameters governing the disorder in the system . in order to calculate the quenched averaged value of a physical quantity , we need to perform the averaging over the probability distribution of several realizations , each of which corresponds to a fixed configuration of the system , after calculating the value of the physical quantity for the fixed configurations .",

    "the presence of quantum correlations between subsystems of a composite system helps in realizing many quantum information protocols . in order to explore these protocols ,",
    "it is necessary to quantify the quantum correlations involved . in this work ,",
    "we have mainly used two quantum correlations measures , namely , concurrence and quantum discord .",
    "they belong to two different paradigms of quantum correlation  while the first corresponds to the entanglement - separability paradigm , the other is in the information - theoretic one . in the following subsections , we will briefly introduce both the quantum correlation measures considered here .",
    "we will then provide a short introduction of the concept of quantum correlation lemgth .",
    "concurrence @xcite quantifies the amount of entanglement present in an arbitrary two - qubit state .",
    "given a two - qubit density matrix , @xmath34 , the concurrence is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 s are the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath37 and satisfy the order @xmath38 . here",

    "the quantity @xmath49 for a two - party quantum system @xmath34 , can be argued to quantify the total correlation present in the system where @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the local density matrices of @xmath34 @xcite . this quantity can be interpreted as the quantized version of the first expression of the classical mutual information in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mutual1 ] ) . to quantize the other expression",
    ", we consider that a measurement is performed on one party , say @xmath53 , using a complete set of rank - one projectors , @xmath54 , satisfying the relations @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the post - measurement ensemble is given by @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the system with observer @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding quantum conditional entropy is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the quantum version of the second expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mutual1 ] ) of classical mutual information then reads @xmath64 which turns out to be inequivalent to the expression in eq.([eqn : dis ] ) , and can be argued as a measure of classical correlation of the state @xmath34 .",
    "quantum discord @xcite is defined as the difference between these two inequivalent quantities , and is given by @xmath65    in all the cases considered in this paper , the bipartite states are @xmath66 states @xcite with @xmath67 , for which an analytical form of quantum discord is available @xcite .",
    "we have also checked the claim numerically .",
    "when the measurement is performed by the first party , i.e. on the @xmath10 spin of a two - party state @xmath27 , the classical correlation is given by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being the binary entropy .",
    "as mentioned earlier , our primary aim is to investigate quantum correlation length in quenched disordered @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin models . for",
    "arbitrary ordered spin systems , let us first define the entanglement length , in particular , concurrence length . if the concurrence , @xmath71 between the @xmath10 and @xmath72 spins behaves as @xmath73 we refer to @xmath74 as the concurrence length . for",
    "quenched disordered systems , the concurrence length for the quenched averaged two - site concurrences , if the latter behaves as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : el_c ] ) , will be denoted by @xmath75 . in this paper",
    ", entanglement length will mean concurrence length .",
    "similar to the concurrence length , one can define discord length , @xmath76 , for the ordered models , if the quantum discord , @xmath77 , between the @xmath10 and the @xmath72 sites behaves as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are parameters that are determined by the model under consideration . and similarly as above , the discord length for quenched disordered spin models can be defined , and is denoted by @xmath81 . a note on the units used here and henceforth in the paper .",
    "the entanglement and discord length are in the units of lattice distance . the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_el_d ] ) and in similar equations are in bits , just as for quantum discord .",
    "we have kept silent a multiplicative constant on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : el_c ] ) that has the unit of ebits , just as the concurrences .",
    "note that this is different from the concept of _ localizable entanglement _ , the amount of entanglement that can be concentrated between two parties through measurements performed on the rest of the parties @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the ordered quantum @xmath0 model is exactly solvable for finite as well as infinite spin chains  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit of the system ,",
    "closed form expressions for the magnetization @xcite and the two - point correlation functions @xcite are known , which are necessary to calculate the two - body density matrices between two arbitrary sites , and eventually to compute quantities like the concurrence and quantum discord . however ,",
    "this is not the case for the disordered systems and one is ultimately restricted to study finite size systems , but techniques similar to those for the infinite system can help to compute quantum correlations for relatively large systems @xcite .    in order to make a comparison between the disordered and ordered systems , we fix the means of the distributions of the disordered parameters in the disordered systems to be identical to the corresponding parameters of the ordered system .",
    "in particular , the quenched averaged physical quantity , @xmath82 , corresponds to the disordered system with disordered parameters @xmath83 having means @xmath84 respectively .",
    "the corresponding physical quantity for the ordered system is then @xmath85 , where the values of the system parameters @xmath83 are kept constant at @xmath84 respectively .",
    "note that in the case of the ordered @xmath0 model , the ground state is multipartite entangled except at @xmath86 which is known as the factorization point @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the ground state is doubly degenerate and both the degenerate states are factorized as a tensor product of quantum states corresponding to all the individual spins .",
    "since we have taken the ground state to be a pure symmetric state by taking equal superposition of both the degenerate ground states , the two spin entanglement here vanishes at this point , while quantum discord may have a non - zero value .",

    "the solid and dotted lines show exponential fits for different cases . for the disordered case ,",
    "the number of random realizations taken is 8000.,width=294 ]",
    "in the previous section , we studied quantum correlation length of the quantum @xmath0 models .",
    "in particular , our results showed that even though the disorder - driven systems are only minimally benefited in terms of the enhancement in concurrence length , a noteworthy endowment occurs in discord length .",
    "it is natural to inquire whether the findings are generic in one dimensional systems .",
    "specifically , one can extend the analysis to the disordered quantum @xmath1 spin glass ( see eq .",
    "(  [ eqn : xyz ] ) ) in order to find the extent to which the robustness of quantum correlations against the distance between interacting sites are affected further due to the introduction of additional @xmath32-interaction , denoted by @xmath162 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xyz ] ) ) .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the main difficulty in handling a generic one - dimensional system is the absence of an analytical approach akin to the @xmath0 model .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the ground state of the @xmath1 spin chain , we employ the dmrg technique , which is best suited for studying the spin chains with open boundary conditions in order to achieve high accuracy .",
    "however , the drawback is that the measurement of the observables on the fringes would experience boundary effects . in order to investigate the correlations encapsulated between two sites",
    ", we consider the central spin on the @xmath163 site and another site which is positioned at a distance @xmath93 from the @xmath163 site , but is still far from the boundary .",
    "+ let us first concentrate on the entanglement length in the ordered as well as disordered systems . fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_con ] illustrates the behavior of concurrence as a function of distance .",
    "we notice that in the ordered system , increasing @xmath162 raises the concurrence length for @xmath164 while there is no notable change in the length , when @xmath165 ( see fig [ fig : decay_con ] ) .",
    "the situation is true also when disorder in introduced in the system .",
    "however , the disordered system fares better than the ordered system in the region @xmath165 compared to that of the @xmath164 for higher values of @xmath162 .    similar to the @xmath0 model",
    ", quantum discord behaves quite differently than entanglement in the @xmath1 model with small values of @xmath32- interaction , i.e. , @xmath162 , essentially mimicking the results obtained for the @xmath0 model .",
    "enhancements of discord length are observed both in @xmath166 and @xmath167 regions in the presence of disorder .",
    "for example , for @xmath168 , and @xmath113 , @xmath169 for the disordered system while @xmath170 for the ordered @xmath1 spin chain . for higher values of @xmath171 ,",
    "say , @xmath172 in the case of disordered system and @xmath173 for the ordered one .",
    "+ however , in the region @xmath174 , the advantage of discord length obtained in the @xmath0 spin glass over the corresponding ordered system is faded out with increase of the @xmath32-interaction .",
    "it also indicates that there exists an interplay between the randomness in the coupling strength and the non - random @xmath32-interaction . in particular , for fixed @xmath110 , with the increase of @xmath162 , the discord length decreases in the disordered system .",
    "this is illustarted in table [ table : nonlin ] , where we consider a chain of 24 spins .",

    "in summary , we concentrate mainly on the effects of disorder in quantum correlation lengths of spin chains .",
    "the paradigmatic models that we consider are @xmath0 spin glass model in which coupling strengths are chosen randomly , the @xmath0 spin chain with random field , and the @xmath1 model with random @xmath176- and @xmath177-couplings .",
    "specifically , we compare quantum correlation lengths , namely entanglement and quantum discord lengths , of the disordered models with the corresponding ordered systems .",
    "+ we find that entanglement length neither shows significant reduction nor increase with the introduction of disorder in the system . in sharp contrast , the discord length is significantly higher in the @xmath0 disordered model in comparision to the corresponding ordered ones .",
    "the features remain unaltered in the @xmath1 model for low values of the @xmath32-interactions .",
    "higher values of the @xmath32-interaction , however , interfares destructively with the disordered couplings , to supress the disorder - induced enhancement in discord length . as a consequence of the fact that discord remains finite between arbitrary two sites",
    ", we prove that quantum discord can not satisfy a large class of monogamy relations for the ground states of the ordered and disordered spin models for sufficiently large systems .",
