    "radio galaxies are at present the only high redshift galaxies which are not explicitly selected on the basis of high star formation rates , but which can nevertheless be found in reasonably large numbers .",
    "this makes them potentially very valuable for understanding the evolution of massive galaxies at early times .",
    "unfortunately , the strong correlation of the radio and uv emission in the most radio - luminous galaxies ( the `` alignment effect '' ; see , e.g. , best et al .",
    "1997 and ridgway & stockton 1997 ) indicates that their photometric properties are probably dominated by the presence of an agn , at least at rest wavelengths @xmath5 , a deduction which was confirmed by spectroscopically for most @xmath3 3c radio galaxies by hammer , lefvre & angonin ( 1993 ) .",
    "this makes defining and studying samples of radio sources selected at fainter flux density levels important , as , due to the correlation of radio luminosity with the optical / uv luminosity of the agn ( e.g.  willott et al .",
    "1999 ) , such objects should have only a very small fraction of their light produced by the agn .",
    "in two previous papers ( lacy , rawlings & warner 1992 ; lacy et al .",
    "1993 ; hereafter papers i and ii ) , we defined and presented radio and optical imaging data for a sample of radio sources selected from the 38-mhz survey of rees ( 1990 ) in the region of the north ecliptic cap ( nec ) . in a companion paper ( lacy et al .",
    "1999b ; hereafter paper iv ) we present optical spectroscopy of this sample , along with that of a sample selected at 151mhz with a comparable flux limit and in the same region of sky ( the 7c - iii sample , lacy et al .",
    "1999c ) and which therefore has most objects in common with this sample .",
    "we have already discussed the outcome of high - resolution optical observations of a @xmath6 sub - sample of objects from the 7c - iii sample which show that the radio  optical `` alignment effect '' in the 7c - iii sample is weak , but probably present , even at wavelengths longward of 4000@xmath7(lacy et al .",
    "thus is it possible that even in these radio - faint ( @xmath8-times fainter than 3c ) samples , the radio source is influencing the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "as we discuss there , however , the scale of the alignments does seem to change with radio luminosity , in the sense that the alignments of the 7c - iii radio galaxies are detectable only on small scales ( in @xmath9 kpc radius apertures ) , whereas the 3c radio galaxies have equally strong alignments at 15 kpc and 50 kpc .",
    "this could be because the highly radio - luminosity dependent mechanisms such as scattering of the hidden quasar nucleus and nebular emission disappear in the 7c - iii objects , leaving a less luminosity - dependent mechanism which only operates on small scales .",
    "relatively `` passive '' mechanisms may be responsible for these alignments , for example dust disks with axes along the radio axis and/or selection effects .",
    "if this were the case the photometric properties of the underlying galaxy would be unaffected by the presence of the radio source .",
    "however , it is possible that jet - induced star formation is only weakly radio - luminosity dependent , and if this mechanism operates then it would imply an intimate connection between the presence of the radio source and the stellar population of the host .",
    "the observational evidence for this mechanism is as yet only circumstantial however , and it is not clear whether such a mechanism could be effective ( icke 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss further optical , radio and near - infrared observations of the 8c sample , and use the spectroscopy presented in paper iv to discuss the photometric properties and evolution of the radio source hosts . unless otherwise stated we assume an @xmath10 ( einstein  de sitter ) cosmology with @xmath11 .",
    "radio snapshot observations of two of the sources in the sample , 8c1804 + 632 and 8c1826 + 660 were made with the vla in c - array at 1.4 ghz on 1993 june 28 to attempt to resolve ambiguities of identification in paper ii .",

    "these data were calibrated and analysed in the standard manner and the maps are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition a four minute 8ghz a - array observation of 8c 1826 + 651 was made on 1996 december 31 to attempt to identify a central component .",
    "a 0.6 mjy point source was detected at 18 26 31.41 + 65 10 46.0 ( b1950 ) , this is consistent with the identification in paper ii and corresponds to optical / infrared component ` b ' of fig .",

    "measured @xmath35 , to our observations in 1993 may 8 ( @xmath36 ) , although due to the errors in the photometry this result should be considered tentative .      a further radio image of this object ( fig .",

    "although such diagrams as this and the more famous @xmath38 relation are somewhat `` blunt instruments '' for studying radio galaxy evolution , where a number of different effects may be contributing to the light as a function of redshift , they have some useful features which can be exploited if they are used in conjunction with detailed studies of smaller samples of objects .",
    "as expected , the scatter in the @xmath37 relation is fairly low ( with a few notable exceptions ) until @xmath0 , where the 4000@xmath7break moves through the @xmath2-band . above this redshift",
    "there is a wide range in the amount of rest - frame uv light , as has been noted for the 3c sample ( lilly & longair 1984 ) , but generally the galaxies are less luminous than their 3c counterparts , consistent with the findings of dunlop & peacock ( 1993 ) for their psr sample .",
    "up to at least @xmath39 there seems to be an upper envelope to the magnitudes which traces the expected locus of an old stellar population , consistent with the idea that in many objects the host galaxy is not strongly evolving out to these redshifts .",
    "the presence of a weak alignment effect in the 7c sample ( lacy et al .",
    "1998a ) suggests some of the light may be influenced by the presence of the radio galaxy , however , so deep spectroscopy of these objects is really needed to confirm this .",
    "six objects have no redshift information , and are plotted as open squares at the top left of fig .  5 with arbitary redshifts .",

    "there is one interesting low-@xmath41 outlier on this plot .",
    "8c1743 + 637 ( @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) is in the cluster a2280 , close to 8c1742 + 637 , but was originally thought to be behind it from the point of view of both the radio structure ( which is more frii - like than fri - like ) and its magnitude ( paper ii ) .",
    "it is possible that emission from a cluster galaxy is contaminating our spectrum , however .",

    "the low redshift objects cluster around the no evolution prediction fairly well .",
    "there are two very red objects , 8c1743 + 645 with @xmath45 , but an unknown redshift , and 8c1816 + 671 with @xmath46 which has a ( tentative ) redshift of 0.92 based on a single weak emission line ( paper iv ) .",
    "presumably these are both @xmath47 objects with little blue light .",
    "( 200,200 ) ( -5,-65 )      a remarkable property of the radio galaxies out to at least @xmath0 is their `` standard candle '' nature over a wide range in radio luminosities , illustrated here in fig .  5 and also present in other low radio luminosity , moderate redshift samples ( e.g.  rixon , wall & benn 1991 ) .",
    "this has interesting implications for our understanding of what determines radio luminosity . to relate radio luminosity to the mass of the black hole",
    ", one could assume that radio jet power scales with accretion power and therefore with black hole mass in the eddington limit ; thus one might expect less radio - luminous galaxies to have less massive black holes .",
    "correlations between black hole mass and the mass of spheroidal components in nearby galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , however , suggest that the small dispersion in host galaxy luminosities tranlates to a small dispersion in black hole mass .",
    "two possible explanations which would allow similar black hole masses to produce a wide range of radio luminosities are : ( 1 ) the radio jet power is constant for black holes of a given mass , and what determines the radio luminosity is the environmental density into which the jets propagate ( barthel & arnaud 1996 ) ; or ( 2 ) the radio jet power is determined by a factor which operates within the `` central engine '' region of galaxies with only the most massive black holes and which has to be linked in some way to the accretion power to produce the radio - luminosity  emission - line luminosity correlation over a wide range in accretion rates ( willott et al .",
    "1999 ) . the lack of a strong correlation between radio luminosity and environment ( hill & lilly 1991 ) and the correlation of radio - loud quasar optical and radio luminosities found by serjeant et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and willott et al .",
    "( 1998 ) both argue that the dominant factor in determining the radio luminosity is jet power , although environmental effects may of course play a secondary rle .",
    "the excess blue light above that expected from a non - evolving elliptical seen in many objects at @xmath48 could clearly have a number of origins , including ones associated with nuclear activity such as scattered quasar light and nebular continuum emission , but star formation is also a likely contributor .",
    "indeed , if , as widely believed , radio galaxy hosts are giant ellipticals or their progenitors at all redshifts , then one can estimate the amount of uv light expected from star formation if radio galaxies form all their @xmath49 of stars in a single burst starting at @xmath50 and finishing at @xmath39 .",
    "this is plotted on fig .  5 as the long - dashed line , assuming a scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function .",
    "the average star formation rate , @xmath51yr@xmath15 is high enough that _ unobscured _ star formation at or above this rate should be easily detected in our @xmath52 objects .",
    "the fact that they all lie close to or fainter than this line could be attributed to several causes : ( 1 ) obscuration by dust may be extinguishing the uv light , ( 2 ) the star - forming episodes are of short duration , ( 3 ) the star - forming episodes occur mostly at very high redshift , ( 4 ) the star formation occurs in small sub - units before the radio galaxy host assembles , or ( 5 ) the cosmology is significantly different from einstein  de sitter .",
    "hughes and collaborators are performing a scuba - based submm survey of high redshift radio galaxies from the 3c and 6c ( eales 1985 ) surveys which should help to address point ( 1 ) ( e.g.  hughes & dunlop 1998 ; hughes et al .  1998 ) .",
    "current limits on star formation rates are about an order of magnitude higher than @xmath51yr@xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , several detections of @xmath53 galaxies have already been made at this level .",
    "in addition best et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have reported a probable detection of the @xmath54 radio galaxy 3c324 .",
    "these detections , however , may only be upper limits too , in the sense that much of the fir emission could be coming from dust heated by the agn rather than from a starburst .",
    "the large dust masses involved , though , suggest at the very least that a large amount of star formation must have taken place in these objects by the time they are observed .",
    "possibility ( 2 ) can probably be ruled out unless the starbursts occur systematically before the formation of the radio source .",
    "even so , such very bright starbursts should be easily detected in the ir / submm ( if they are dusty ) or in optical narrow - band searches if not .",
    "support for ( 3 ) or ( 4 ) , very high redshift star formation either coherently or in small subunits which subsequently merge , comes from the studies of the old stellar populations in the radio galaxies 3c65 ( @xmath54 ; lacy et al .  1995b ; stockton et al .",
    "1995 ) and 53w091 ( @xmath55 , dunlop et al .",
    "the old stellar populations seen in some radio galaxies contrast with the studies of zepf ( 1997 ) and barger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who find relatively low numbers of very red galaxies in optical / infrared studies of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) and its flanking fields .",
    "these show that only @xmath56 per cent of field ellipticals are in place by @xmath39 , and that the remainder probably formed at @xmath57 . the relatively high uv luminosity density produced by @xmath58 lyman - dropout galaxies found by steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , however , points to the possibility that at least some galaxies formed at higher redshifts . [ dust - obscured starbursts may affect this picture if they are important contributors to the star formation process in ellipticals , but currently this is uncertain ( e.g.  trentham , blain & goldader 1998 ) . ]",
    "a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the ages of some radio galaxies and the field ellipticals is that giant elliptical galaxies formed earlier than normal @xmath59 elliptical galaxies",
    ". this would be broadly consistent with an extrapolation of a trend deduced by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for more massive galaxies to have their major episodes of star formation at earlier epochs .",
    "if the oldest galaxies are the super-@xmath60 population , they will be rare in the relatively small area field surveys made to date .",
    "explanation ( 5 ) , an incorrect cosmology , remains possible .",
    "for example an @xmath61 cosmology with the same value of @xmath62 only requires a minimum star formation rate of @xmath63 to form all the stars by @xmath39 , and the emission will also appear fainter at a given redshift due to the higher luminosity distance .",
    "these combine to make the @xmath2-magnitude for a @xmath64 galaxy forming stars at the minimum rate 0.8 mag fainter , for example .",
    "the lack of uv emission also argues somewhat against jet - induced star formation being an important contributor to the star formation process of the galaxy as a whole , at least at @xmath57 .",
    "if it were , one would expect all radio galaxies to show large amounts of uv and/or submm emission .",
    "it remains possible though that an initial episode of star formation activity could be triggered by an early outburst of radio jet activity at high redshift , and that subsequent episodes of radio jet activity would produce more modest starbursts , consistent with the relatively low limits on the unobscured star formation rates we infer for the 8c radio galaxies .",
    "we thank the staff at the mcdonald observatory and the wht for their assistance .",
