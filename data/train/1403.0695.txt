    "after the initial boom in graphene research , recent years have seen a surge of interest in other two - dimensional ( 2d ) atomic crystals  @xcite . among them , molybdenum disulfide ( @xmath0 ) , a prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide , has attracted great attention due to its excellent electronic and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "similar to graphite , bulk @xmath0 consists of vertically stacked layers that are loosely coupled via the van der waals interaction .",
    "when shaped into monolayer , the energy gap changes from indirect to direct ( @xmath31.9ev ) , right in the visible frequency range  @xcite , allowing applications such as transistors  @xcite , photodetectors and electroluminescent devices .",
    "in addition , due to the strong spin - orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry , monolayer @xmath0 also exhibit novel valley and spin physics as demonstrated recently  @xcite .    to realize its application potential in multi - functional electronic devices ,",
    "it is essential to understand the transport mechanisms in @xmath0 .",
    "compared with graphene  @xcite , the mobility of pristine @xmath0 is rather low , typically on the order of 10 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) at room temperature .",
    "higher mobilities can be achieved by gate dielectric engineering to effectively screen the coulomb scattering on charged impurities and suppress electron - phonon scattering , values in the range from 200 to 700 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) have been reported  @xcite . on the other hand , theoretical calculations of the phonon - limited mobility , using the deformation potential approximation or full band monte carlo simulation , have placed an intrinsic limit in the range of @xmath4 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) at room temperature  @xcite , which are close to experimental values .",
    "this suggests that further improvement of the mobility must come from better control of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "strain engineering  @xcite and electron - doping  @xcite have been successfully used to improve the performance of @xmath0 , such as energy gap and superconductivity . here",
    ", we have systematically investigated the electron - doping and strain dependence of the transport electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 and the phonon - limited mobility @xmath6 in monolayer @xmath0 based on first - principles calculations and the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "it is found that @xmath5 increases with increasing doping concentration @xmath7 , reaches the maximum at @xmath8 @xmath9 before starts decreasing .",
    "remarkably , @xmath5 can be significantly reduced by applying a small amount of strain .",
    "this is due to the change of energy difference between the k and q valleys , which effectively suppresses the inter - valley scattering  @xcite .",
    "we show that even with 3% strain the mobility can be increased from 275 to 1150 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) .",
    "our results provide an effective method to modulate the electron transport of @xmath0 by external strain .",
    "our calculation is based on the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory .",
    "details of theory can be found in ref .  .",
    "the key quantity is the transport electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath10for wavevector @xmath11 and mode index @xmath12 , defined by  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electron - phonon interaction matrix element , @xmath15 and the efficiency factor , @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epcq ] ) , @xmath17 is the density of state at the fermi surface , @xmath18 is the total number of @xmath19 points , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the band energy and group velocity of the bloch electrons , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) , m is the atomic mass , and @xmath22 is the derivative of the self - consistent effective potential with respect to atomic displacement associated with the phonon from branch @xmath12 with the wave vector @xmath11 and frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath24 shows that only backward scattering will contribute to the resistance .",
    "similar to the relation between the eliashberg function and the superconducting electron - phonon coupling constant , the transport spectral function @xmath25and the transport electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 can be obtained by  @xcite , @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total number of @xmath29 points .    finally , using transport spectral function @xmath25 , the relaxation time @xmath30 can be derived by solving the boltzmann equation in the lowest - order variational approximation ( lova ) as , @xmath31 @xmath32\\\\ \\{[n(\\omega ) + 1]\\delta ( \\epsilon -\\epsilon'-\\hbar \\omega ) + n(\\omega ) \\delta ( \\epsilon -\\epsilon'+\\hbar",

    ", the influence of impurities and electron - electron scattering are not included evidently in our calculations , which are subject to further investigations .    utilizing the transport electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the temperature dependence of mobility @xmath36 can be obtained by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average square of the fermi velocity along the @xmath39 direction , @xmath40 is the area of unit cell .     at doping concentration of @xmath41 @xmath9 .",
    "the doping effect ( @xmath42 @xmath9 ) at @xmath43 ( c ) and the strain effect ( @xmath44 ) at @xmath41 @xmath9 ( d ) on the lowest conduction band along the @xmath45-@xmath46 direction ( labeled by red color in ( a ) ) . the band structure at @xmath45 and q points",

    "all calculations in this work were carried out in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) with local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , as implemented in the quantum espresso package  @xcite .",
    "the ion and electron interactions are treated with the norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff of 30 ry and monkhorst - pack @xmath48-mesh of @xmath49 were used in all calculations of electronic properties .",
    "the atomic positions were relaxed fully with the energy convergence criteria of @xmath50 ry and the force convergence criteria of @xmath51 ry / a.u . in our slab model , a vacuum layer with 15   was set to avoid the interactions between the adjacent atomic layers .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constant of the monolayer @xmath0 was found to be @xmath52  .",
    "the electron doping was achieved by increasing the valence charge and at the same time introducing the same amount of uniform background charge .",
    "the strain was introduced by adjusted the lattice constant @xmath53 of the monolayer @xmath0 with the strain capacity @xmath54 .",
    "the phonon dispersion and electron - phonon coupling were calculated on a @xmath55 @xmath56-grid using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite . we have carefully checked the convergence of q - point sampling with the denser grid of @xmath57 , while the difference is only below 1% .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion of monolayer @xmath0 with different electron doping concentrations and strains .",
    "central to our discussion is the existence of a second energy minima in the conduction band , called q valley , which is about 100 mev higher than the conduction band minimum at the k valley , and approximately located at the halfway point of the @xmath45-k line . because of the close proximity in energy , the inter - valley scattering between the k and q valleys has a significant effect on transport  @xcite .",
    "we note that while the conduction band at the @xmath45 point displays a strong dependence on the doping concentration , with a large drop after @xmath58 @xmath9 , the band at the q point shows little change with various concentrations [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] . on the other hand , the energy difference between the k and q valleys ( e@xmath59 ) can be modified significantly by the strain [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) ] , consistent with previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "the change of phonon dispersion also shows the important roles of the electron doping and strain .",
    "the acoustic phonon branch ( _ i.e. , _ longitudinal acoustic mode ) around the m point ( denoted by @xmath60 for simplicity ) appears phonon softening with increasing doping concentration up to @xmath61 @xmath9 .",
    "however , for @xmath58 @xmath9 the phonon dispersion does not show any obvious change as @xmath7 is varied [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e ) ] .",
    "the @xmath60 phonons softening is also significantly suppressed by applying the strain [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](f ) ] .",
    "the strong dependence of both the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion on the doping and strain indicates that the electron - phonon coupling should show similar trend . to quantify this statement ,",
    "we have calculated the transport spectral function @xmath25 and transport electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "the map distribution of wave - vector - resolved transport electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath62 as a function of doping concentrations in the absence of strain is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a)-[fig:2](d ) .",
    "one can see that the transport electron - phonon coupling around the m point is always the strongest , while those of k and @xmath45 points are rather small .",
    "it indicates that @xmath60 phonons is the dominating contributor to the transport electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the electronic transitions between the k and q valleys scattered by @xmath63 phonons  @xcite is described as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the electronic state with the momentum k ( q ) . with the increase of doping concentration , the electrons occupying on the k and q valleys increase and the frequency of phonons around the m point decreases [ fig .  [ fig:1](e ) ] .",
    "consequently , the coupling to @xmath63 phonons increases sharply [ figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a)-[fig:2](c ) ] .",
    "however , it starts decreasing when @xmath58 @xmath9 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) ] .",
    "one reason is the little dependence of the @xmath63 phonons on @xmath7 after it reaches @xmath67 @xmath9 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e ) ] .",
    "the other is the reduction of electrons in the q valley , which arises from the lowering of the conduction band at the @xmath45 point [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] .",
    "furthermore , the lowering of conduction band at @xmath45 point also results in the appearance of two more channels of electronic transitions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which can be derived from the band structure and nesting function ( see appendix ) .",
    "however , since the phonon frequencies at both k and q points are higher than that of m point [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] , according to the eq .  ( [ eq : epcq ] ) , these two additional channels have much weaker electron - phonon coupling comparing with the @xmath64 channel [ fig .  [",
    "fig:2](d ) ] .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath70 can be greatly suppressed once a small amount of strain is introduced [ figs .",
    "[ fig:2](e)-[fig:2](h ) ] .",
    "this is because of the hardening of the @xmath60 phonons under strain condition and the increase of e@xmath59 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) ] .     at the doping concentration of @xmath71 @xmath9 with @xmath72 ( black dash line ) and @xmath41 @xmath9 with @xmath73 ( black solid line ) and @xmath74 ( red solid line ) .",
    "( b ) transport electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 as a function of the doping concentration @xmath75 at various strains of @xmath76 = 0% , 0.4% , 0.8% , 1.2% , and 3.0% .",
    "[ fig:3],scaledwidth=50.0% ]     as a function of the doping concentration @xmath75 at various strains of @xmath76 = 0% , 0.4% , 0.8% , 1.2% , and 3.0% . [ fig:4],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig:3](a ) shows the transport spectral function @xmath25 versus doping concentration under different strains .",
    "@xmath25 spreads through a wide frequency range , but shows strong peaks at low frequencies , 80 @xmath3 150 @xmath77 , corresponding to the @xmath63 phonons .",
    "the position of this main region shifts down with increase of the doping concentration , consistent with the behavior of the @xmath63 phonons softening , while position of the high frequency region is almost unchanged . after the application of strain , @xmath25",
    "is then greatly suppressed .",
    "the curves of @xmath5 with electron doping concentration under different strains are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) .",
    "one can see that in the absence of strain , @xmath5 is strongly dependent on the doping concentration , in agreement with the results of raman spectroscopy and superconductivity researchs  @xcite .",
    "the maximum ( @xmath31.6 ) of @xmath5 appears at @xmath78 @xmath9 .",
    "however , with added strain , the maximum of @xmath5 shifts down to 0.14 , and the overall @xmath5 versus @xmath7 curve becomes rather flat .",
    "the doping and strain effects on @xmath5 are consistent with the discussion of @xmath70 as above illustration .",
    "the mobility @xmath36 calculated at room temperature ( @xmath79 k ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . under the strain - free condition",
    ", @xmath6 is inversely proportional to the doping concentration in a wide range of doping level and increases slightly in the high doping level due to the change of electron - phonon coupling . in the two previous theoretical studies",
    "@xcite , the mobility has been estimated to be 130 ( 410 ) @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) respectively , depending on with ( without ) the consideration of the scattering of q valley .",
    "it agrees well that our estimation of 275 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) at @xmath80 @xmath9 falls somewhere between them .",
    "next , we turn to discuss the stain effect on the mobility . at the low doping concentration of @xmath81 , @xmath76 = 3.0% strain can increase mobility from 275 to 1150 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) , for the strain can greatly suppress the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in addition , the change of mobility by strain from @xmath76 = 1.2% to @xmath76 = 3.0% is inconspicuous in the low doping level ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "it can be ascribed to that the influence of q valley scattering to the mobility is rather weak such that can be almost totally removed by a small strain ( @xmath83 ) . at the high doping concentration ( @xmath84 ) ,",
    "the modulation of mobility by strain becomes more significant , from 4.9 to 66.0 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) by a factor of 10 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ] .",
    "although the present estimation of 275 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) is coincide with theoretical predictions and some experiments as well , a significant difference was observed compared with the high value of 700 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s )  @xcite .",
    "considering the lattice mismatching with the substrates in the different experimental preparations , the strain appears inevitably in @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it is provided in our results that the mobility is exquisitely sensitive to the external strain , @xmath3 1000 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) improved by the strain of 1.2% .",
    "clearly , the question about disparity between theoretical predictions and experimental results can be reasonably illustrated in this work .",
    "in summary , we have studied the doping and strain effects on the transport electron - phonon coupling and intrinsic mobility in monolayer @xmath0 based on first - principles methods with boltzmann transport theory .",
    "we estimate that under the strain - free condition the mobility has a maximum 275 @xmath1/(v@xmath2s ) . based on the analysis of electron - phonon coupling",
    ", it is found that the inter - valley scattering between the q and k valleys assisted by @xmath85 phonons are the main source of electric resistance .",
    "however , applying a small amount of strain can significantly increase the mobility by several times for the modulation effects on the lowest conduction band .",
    "our results illustrate the effective modulation of strain on mobility in @xmath86 .",
