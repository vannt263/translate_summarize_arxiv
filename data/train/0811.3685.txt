    "the motion of inertial particles in fluids is governed by dynamical equations which display rich and complex behaviour .",
    "the inertial particles have density that is different from that of the fluid in which they are immersed , in contrast to the neutral particles which have the same density of the fluid .",
    "the dynamics of the inertial particles deserve attention from both the point of view of fundamental physics as they exhibit complex behaviour , as well as from that of their applicability to practical situations e.g. the transport of pollutants in the atmosphere and plankton in oceans @xcite .",
    "if impurities in fluids are modeled by small spherical tracers , the lagrangian dynamics of such small spherical tracers in two dimensional incompressible fluid flows is described by the maxey - riley equations .",
    "these are further simplified under various approximations to give a set of minimal equations called the embedding equations where the fluid flow dynamics is embedded in a larger set of equations which include the differences between the particle and fluid velocities@xcite .",
    "although the lagrangian dynamics of the underlying fluid flow is incompressible , the particle motion is compressible @xcite , and has regions of contraction and expansion .",
    "the density grows in the former giving rise to clusters and falls in the latter giving rise to voids .",
    "the properties of the base flow have important consequences for the transport and mixing of particles .",
    "map analogs of the embedding equations have also been constructed for cases where the fluid dynamics is modeled by area - preserving maps which essentially retain the qualitative features of the flow @xcite .",
    "the embedded dynamics in both cases is dissipative in nature .",
    "further complexity is added to the dynamics by the density difference between the particles and the fluid . in the case of two - dimensional chaotic flows , it has been observed earlier that particles with density higher than the base flow , the aerosols , tend to migrate away from the kam islands , while particles lighter than the fluid , the bubbles , display the opposite tendency @xcite .",
    "neutrally buoyant particles also showed a similar result , wherein the particles settled into the kam islands .",
    "our study indicates that in addition to the density difference , the dissipation parameter of the system also has an important role to play in the dynamic behaviour of the aerosols and the bubbles .    in sec .",
    "ii of this paper , the maxey - riley equation describing the motion of inertial particles is simplified to get a minimal equation of motion .",
    "a map analog of this minimal equation called the embedding map , is obtained to model the particle dynamics in discrete time .",
    "the fluid dynamics is represented by a @xmath0 base map , which we choose to be the standard map .",
    "the embedding map is four dimensional and dissipative , while the base map is two dimensional and area - preserving . unlike the earlier results mentioned above , viz . that the bubbles tended to form structures in the kam islands@xcite and the aerosols",
    "were pushed away , we found that structures form for both bubbles and aerosols in certain parameter regimes due to the role of the dissipation parameter .",
    "both the aerosol and bubble regimes in the phase diagram show regions where periodic orbits as well as chaotic structures can be seen in the phase space plots . in sec .",
    "iii we obtain the phase diagram of the system in the @xmath2 space where @xmath3 is the mass ratio parameter , and @xmath4 is the dissipation parameter .",
    "the phase diagram shows rich structure in the @xmath5 aerosol regime , as well as the @xmath6 bubble regime .",
    "in addition to these , fully or partially mixed regimes can also be seen in both the aerosol and bubble cases .",
    "thus the dynamic behaviour of the inertial particles can be of three major types .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of the four dimensional map is used as the characterizers in demarcating these three major regimes .",
    "our results can have implications for practical problems such as the dispersion of pollutants by atmospheric flows , and catalytic chemical reactions .",

    "the first term in the right of eqn . [ maxey ] represents the force exerted by the undisturbed flow on the particle , the second term represents the buoyancy , the third term represents the stokes drag , the fourth term represents the added mass , and the last the basset - bossinesq history force term .",

    "the faxen correction @xmath19 is of the magnitude @xmath20 , and from the assumption , @xmath21 , this term s contribution becomes negligible and can be excluded from the equation .",
    "the basset history force term which takes into account viscous memory effects becomes less significant and can be dropped , as the particle size is sufficiently small and the concentration of particles is sufficiently low , that they do not modify the flow field or interact with each other @xcite . under the low reynolds number approximation ,",
    "both the derivatives @xmath15 and @xmath22 will approximately be the same @xcite .",
    "we assume the buoyancy effects to be negligible .",
    "we thus arrive at the following equation ,    @xmath23    this can be easily written into a non - dimensional form by proper rescaling of length , time and velocity by scale factors @xmath24 , and @xmath25 respectively , to obtain ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the mass ratio parameter , @xmath28 , is the reynolds number of the fluid . by using the particle stokes number @xmath29 and defining the dissipation parameter as @xmath30 , the final simplified equation takes the form ,    @xmath31     +    the map analog of eqn .",
