    "low dimensions means maps on surfaces or flows on @xmath3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "arguably one of the main obstacles to answering this question affirmatively is the existence of ergodic components of positive measure . indeed ,",
    "ergodic maps ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) exhibit strongly different dynamical behavior to integrable ones .",
    "in particular , almost every point is the initial condition for a dense orbit .    using finite energy foliations by pseudoholomorphic curves",
    "we obtain a result of this nature for the class of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the @xmath1-disk known as irrational pseudo - rotations .",
    "irrational pseudo - rotations are of particular interest with regard to this question because they include all known ergodic disk maps with zero topological entropy",
    ".    for each @xmath4 let @xmath5 denote the rigid rotation through angle @xmath6 on the disk @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the spaces of @xmath0-smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk which preserve orientation and the area form @xmath10 respectively .",
    "[ t : main_result_intro ] suppose @xmath11 fixes the origin and has no other periodic points .",
    "then it is the @xmath2-limit of a sequence of maps of the form @xmath12 , for a sequence of conjugating maps @xmath13 which fix the origin , and a sequence of rationals @xmath14 converging to an irrational number .",
    "elements @xmath15 having precisely one periodic point are also known as ( smooth ) _ irrational pseudo - rotations_. see definition [ d : irr_pseudorotation ] .",
    "concerning the convergence of the approximation maps in theorem [ t : main_result_intro ] it is natural to ask whether @xmath2-convergence is so weak as to allow `` almost anything '' to be obtained in the limit ? a more natural topology to consider katok s question , as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "is at least a @xmath16-topology , @xmath17 , in which the topological entropy is lower semi - continuous .",
    "the author would therefore like to thank patrice le calvez for pointing out the following and the idea of its proof using work of franks .",
    "a slightly more general statement is proven in appendix a.    [ p : lecalvez_observation_intro ] suppose @xmath11 is the @xmath2-limit of a sequence of maps of the form @xmath12 , for a sequence of conjugating maps @xmath18 fixing the origin , and a sequence of rationals @xmath14 converging to an irrational number . then @xmath19 necessarily has precisely one periodic point . in particular",
    "it is an irrational pseudo - rotation .",
    "thus @xmath2-convergence is still strong enough to guarantee that the limit object is an irrational pseudo - rotation . in particular",
    "that it has zero entropy .",
    "( due , for example , to katok s theorem for @xmath16 surface diffeomorphisms @xcite that bounds entropy from above by the exponential growth rate of periodic points . )",
    "the existence of ergodic disk maps with zero entropy was established back in 1970 by anosov and katok @xcite . previous to their constructions it was even an open question in the non - conservative setting ; shnirelman 1930 @xcite found a ( non - area preserving ) diffeomorphism of the disk with a dense orbit , further discussion of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the anosov - katok construction to the statement of theorem [ t : main_result_intro ] .",
    "they construct an ergodic map @xmath20 as the @xmath0-limit of a sequence of maps @xmath21 which are inductively constructed with the following form . for each @xmath22 there",
    "exists @xmath23 relatively prime , and @xmath24 , also fixing the origin , so that @xmath25 the maps @xmath26 are arranged so that the orbits of @xmath27 increasingly spread out over the disk as @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the sequence @xmath29 blows up in every @xmath30 topology .",
    "but by interatively choosing @xmath31 sufficiently large depending on the size of @xmath32 , the @xmath33 norm of @xmath27 can be controlled .",
    "a limiting subseqence converges to a map @xmath19 with the desired `` pathalogical '' behavior such as a dense orbit , or ergodicity , or even weak mixing .",
    "more details of this method , other results and questions , are in fayad - katok @xcite .",
    "see also fayad - saprykina @xcite .    in some sense then , theorem [ t : main_result_intro ] reverses the limiting process just described above .",
    "however our conclusions are in two respects weaker than a word for word converse to the anosov - katok construction .",
    "firstly , the convergence @xmath34 in ( [ e : ak_approximation_maps ] ) is in the @xmath35-sense .",
    "each @xmath36 in ( [ e : ak_approximation_maps ] ) preserves the standard area form .",
    "we do not show this for the approximation maps in theorem [ t : main_result_intro ] .",
    "this raises natural questions for further investigation .    a remark on integrability : the notion of integrability for a map on a surface that appears to be referred to in @xcite is that the map should admit a `` first integral '' , that is , a continuous or smooth real valued function on the surface that is not constant on any open set but is constant on the orbits of the given map .",
    "it is obviously in this sense that each of our approximation maps in theorem [ t : main_result_intro ] is integrable .",
    "a natural question is whether approximation maps can be found that are integrable in the liouville - arnold sense",
    ". this would follow if they were area preserving .",
    "pick a closed loop of hamiltonians @xmath37 , over @xmath38 , which generate a symplectic isotopy whose time - one map is @xmath19 .",

    "for each @xmath41 equip @xmath42 with coordinates @xmath43 .",

    "then @xmath53 is a so called cylindrical , symmetric , almost complex manifold .",
    "that is , it is compatible in a precise way with the necessary symplectic structures for the compactness framework from symplectic field theory @xcite to apply to @xmath54-holomorphic curves .    in section [ s",
    ": pf_of_fef ] we adapt techniques developed by hofer , wysocki , and zehnder @xcite to construct finite energy foliations of @xmath53 . that is , a foliation @xmath55 by embedded surfaces that are the images of finite energy @xmath54-holomorphic curves , and where the set @xmath55 is invariant under translations in the @xmath51-direction on @xmath52 .",
    "in a finite energy foliation @xmath55 of @xmath56 intersects the hypersurface @xmath57 in a closed @xmath39-dimensional curve .",
    "we use this to define a disk map @xmath58 . ]    in this setting a finite energy foliation @xmath55 of @xmath53 can be used to define a disk map @xmath59 in the following fairly natural way : identify the mapping torus @xmath45 with the hypersurface @xmath60 .",
    "then each leaf @xmath61 is either disjoint from @xmath45 or intersects it transversally in an embedded closed curve as in figure [ f : disk_map ] .",
    "the closed curve will then intersect each disk slice @xmath62 in @xmath45 transversally and precisely once ( each such disk is also @xmath54-holomorphic ) .",
    "if the curve intersects the disk @xmath63 at a point @xmath64 and intersects the disk @xmath65 at a point @xmath66 , then we set @xmath67 .    for each @xmath41",
    "there is also a `` trivial '' @xmath51-invariant foliation of @xmath53 by @xmath54-holomorphic curves we could refer to as the _ vertical _ foliation @xmath68 .",
    "the leaves of the vertical foliation are all of the form @xmath69 for each trajectory @xmath70 of the vector field @xmath71 .",
    "usually this foliation is of little interest due to its `` instability '' and each leaf besides one has infinite so called @xmath72-energy .",
    "however if we use the vertical foliation to define a disk map as above , we obtain the map @xmath19 of interest .",
    "the leaves of the vertical foliation are characterized by having vanishing so called @xmath73-energy .",
    "it turns out that there exists a sequence of finite energy foliations @xmath74 of @xmath53 with the following property : each leaf in @xmath74 has @xmath73-energy zero or @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be identified with the rotation number of the circle map @xmath77 . in particular",
    "@xmath78 is irrational .",
    "@xmath79 denotes the fractional part of @xmath80 .    restricting to a subsequence @xmath81 for which @xmath82 as @xmath83 , the leaves in @xmath84",
    "converge in some sense to the vertical foliation @xmath85 .",
    "correspondingly the disk maps @xmath86 converge pointwise to the disk map @xmath87 .    by being slightly more careful one obtains uniform convergence .",
    "finally , each foliation @xmath74 has a certain symmetry that ensures that the induced map @xmath88 has @xmath89-th iterate @xmath90 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath88 being conjugate to a rigid rotation through an angle @xmath91 for some @xmath92 .",
    "we only use that @xmath19 is an irrational pseudo - rotation at two points in this argument .",
    "first , to find the nice expression for the @xmath73-energy of the leaves . secondly to show that the maps @xmath88 are roots of unity .",
    "indeed the finite energy foliations themselves exist for generic area preserving disk maps , not just pseudo - rotations .",
    "this will be shown in @xcite .",
    "using quite different techniques , le calvez proved in 2004 , see theorem 1.9 in @xcite , that every minimal @xmath93-diffeomorphism of the @xmath1-torus that is homotopic to the identity can be @xmath2-approximated by periodic @xmath93-diffeomorphisms . recall that a diffeomorphism is minimal if every point is the initial condition for a dense orbit .",
    "thus , in this result also strongly non - integrable maps are approximated by , in some sense , integrable ones .",
    "an interesting result about irrational pseudo - rotations in the class of homeomorphisms of the open and closed annulus homotopic to the identity , was obtained by bguin - crovisier - leroux - patou @xcite and bguin - crovisier - leroux @xcite .",
    "stated for maps on the closed disk this is as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be an orientation preserving , measure preserving , homeomorphism of the disk with a single periodic point and boundary rotation number @xmath94 .",
    "then the rigid rotation @xmath95 is the @xmath2-limit of maps ( not necessarily area preserving ) conjugate to @xmath19 .",
    "the authors of these papers note that one does not know from their approach that @xmath19 is in the closure of the set of maps conjugate to @xmath95 .",

    "hence , being symplectic , the eigenvalues of @xmath850 must be of the form @xmath894 for some @xmath895 . from the real canonical form , @xmath850 is therefore similar to the rotation through @xmath896 and also to the rotation through @xmath897 .",
