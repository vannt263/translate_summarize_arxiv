    "systems with competitive interactions have been extensively studied throughout the past three decades , because they exhibit rich physical phenomena , such as commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions , lifshitz points , and multiphase points.@xcite the axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model is among the simplest realizations of such systems . in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) annni model , ferromagnetic ising chains",

    "the spin structure for @xmath13 is yet to be clarified .",
    "early monte carlo ( mc ) simulations suggested that a floating incommensurate ( ic ) phase exists between the @xmath12 phase and the pm phase.@xcite furthermore , the ic phase close to the higher transition temperature , @xmath0 , may be characterized by dislocations that play the same role of vortices in two - dimensional xy ( 2d xy ) model.@xcite since the phase transition at @xmath0 is considered equivalent to the kosterlitz - thouless@xcite ( kt ) type in the 2d xy model , it is called the kt phase transition .",
