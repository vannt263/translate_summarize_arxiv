    "among type iin supernovae ( sn  iin , with `` n '' standing for `` narrow lines '' ) that are commonly associated with the presence of a dense circumstellar medium there is a unique variety composed of sn  1994w ( sollerman et al .",
    "1998 ) , sn  2009kn ( kankare et al . 2012 ) , and sn  2011ht ( roming et al . 2012 ; mauerhan et al . 2013 ) .",
    "their bolometric light curve has @xmath4 days plateau reminiscent of sn  iip .",
    "the plateau ends up with the luminosity drop by a factor of ten and a subsequent exit to the tail somewhat similar to the radioactive tail of sn  iip but probably of different origin .",
    "maximum with @xmath5 mag is attained at about day 40 .",
    "the spectrum is smooth continuum with strong emission lines of h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 characterized by the narrow core ( fwhm@xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) and broad wings @xmath10 km s@xmath9 .",
    "apart from hydrogen lines the spectrum shows narrow metal lines , mostly feii , with velocity of absorption minima of @xmath11 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the similarity of light curves and spectra of the mentioned supernovae justifies their selection into a special group designated sn  iin - p ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013 ) ; the notation emphasises their resemblance with sn  iin and sn  iip first mentioned for sn  1994w ( sollerman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the model of sn  1994w proposed earlier suggested the explosion of the red supergiant with @xmath12 ejecta and the kinetic energy of @xmath13 erg ( chugai et al .",
    "according to this scenario ( dubbed as scenario a ) the supernova interacts with the dense extended circumstellar ( cs ) envelope ; narrow lines form in the cs envelope expanded at @xmath14 km s@xmath9 ; broad wings are produced by the scattering of line photons on thermal electrons of the same cs envelope .",
    "this scenario , however , faces a serious problem , because it is becoming clear that at the late stage ( @xmath15 d ) supernovae sn  iin - p do not show signatures of the high - velocity material ( @xmath16 km s@xmath9 ) that is predicted by this scenario .",
    "one might suggest that this gas is not seen because the cool dense shell ( cds ) at the contact surface between supernova and cs material is very opaque . at the late stage",
    "this situation might occur , if the dust forms in the cds . yet",
    "the case of sn  1998s where the dust indeed seem to form in the cds ( pozzo et al .",
    "2004 ) broad emission lines are seen , possibly because of the mixing of the fragments of the cds with the hot gas of the forward shock .    in the alternative scenario ( call it b ) proposed by dessart et al .",
    "( 2009 ) the spectrum of sn  1994w , including the continuum and lines , forms in a massive envelope with low expansion velocity ( @xmath17 km s@xmath9 ) implied by narrow lines . in fact , authors have demonstrated that the expanding atmosphere with a steep density gradient , the effective temperature of @xmath18  k , and photosphere radius of @xmath19 cm reproduces the observed spectrum fairly well .",
    "the success of the straightforward scenario in the modelling of the non - trivial spectrum makes this scenario very attractive .",
    "noteworthy , the scanario b does not contain high velocity gas unlike the scenario a.    the scenario b , however , leaves open a question , whether the energy requirements are consistent with the low expansion velocity .",
    "the present paper is focused on this issue . to this",
    "end a model is developed to describe the phenomenon of sn  2011ht for which most complete observations",
    "are available compared to other two sn  iin - p .",
    "the model is based on the thin shell approximation that is commonly used for the analysis of sn  iin . here",
    ", however , the model includes diffusion of the trapped radiation in the optically thick envelope .",
    "the section 2 describes the model , while the section 3 presents results of the light curve modelling .",
    "the modelling of line profiles of h@xmath6 and h@xmath20 is presented in section 4 .",
    "note , the simultaneous description of these lines in the framework of the unified model of the emission and thomson scattering in cs envelope turned out problematic in the former scenario of sn  1994w ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the discovery on 2011 september 29 ( jd=2455834 ) caught sn  2011ht during the rapid flux rise ( roming et al .",
    "2012 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "it is reasonable to admit , therefore , that the explosion took place a few days before the discovery . here the explosion date jd=2455830 is adopted .",
    "the velocity at the photosphere of sn  2011ht fixed by absorption minima , e.g. , h@xmath6 is about 600 km s@xmath9 ( mauerhan et al . 2013 ) ; this value remains constant through the spectral observations ( @xmath21 d ) at the plateau stage .",
    "the latter indicates that the velocity dispersion and the relative thickness of the shell are rather small .",
    "furthermore , the velocity persistence also sugggests that the shell acceleration phase is brief , @xmath22 d , which means in turn that the external radius of the cs envelope is @xmath23 cm .",
    "the main stage of the radiative cooling ( @xmath4 d ) therefore should be considered as the result of slow diffusion of the trapped radiation generated at the early phase @xmath24 d. in this respect sn  2011ht is similar to sn  iip .",
    "the difference is that the bulk of sn  iip matter is distributed in a wide range of velocities which is manifested in the significant decrease of the photospheric velocity at the plateau in contrast to sn  iin - p .",
    "the diffusion time characterized by the plateau stage is several times greater than the acceleration time , so a significant fraction of the internal energy is spent on the pressure work at the plateau stage . the strong raiation - dominated shock in the uniform medium deposits 80% of the energy in the internal energy ( i.e. , radiation ) and 20% in the kinetic energy ( chevalier 1976 ) .",
    "assuming that the initial internal energy is equally shared between the work on the expansion and the escaped radiation , we conclude that roughly 2/3 of the explosion energy is spent on the kinetic energy of the accelerated shell , while 1/3 is escaped radiation .",
    "given the radiated energy of sn  2011ht of @xmath25 erg ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013 ) we thus conclude that the kinetic energy is @xmath26 erg and the explosion energy is @xmath27 erg .",
    "taking into account the expansion velocity of @xmath28 km s@xmath9 and the estimated kinetic energy we infer the total mass of the expanding shell as @xmath29 .    [ t - par ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the small relative thickness of the shell and the brief acceleration phase prompts us a simple model based on the thin shell approximation ( giuliani 1982 ) .",
    "we consider geometrically thin , but optically thick , shell with the interior filled by the radiation .",
    "the radiation energy is determined by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta , by the work of the radiation pressure , and the radiation escape via diffusion .",
    "the equation of motion for this shell is ( cf .",
    "giuliani 1982 ) @xmath30\\ , , \\label{eq - mom}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the mass of the shell with the radius @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the shell expansion velocity , @xmath34 is the supernova density at the radius @xmath32 , @xmath35 is the cs density at the radius @xmath32 , and @xmath36 is the radiation pressure that is assumed to be uniform in the cavity .",
    "the expansion velocity of undisturbed cs matter is presumably negligibly small .",
    "undisturbed supernova ejecta are assumed to expand homologously , ( @xmath37 ) with the density distribution @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 in the inner zone ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 in the outer layers .",
    "the radiation pressure in the cavity is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the radiation energy described by the equation @xmath44 the first term in the right hand side is the rate of the internal energy generation due to the ejecta collision with the thin shell , the second term is the work of the radiation pressure , and the last term is the luminosity due to the radiation diffusion .",
    "the luminosity is determined as @xmath45 , where the diffusion time is @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the shell optical depth , @xmath48 is the speed of light , and @xmath49 is a factor of order unity related to the geometry . for the central source in the uniform sphere @xmath50 ( sunyaev and titarchuk 1980 ) ; a similar value one obtains for the geometrically thin shell filled by the isotropic radiation .",
    "we adopt @xmath50 .",
    "the shell optical depth is calculated using rosseland opacity ( alexander 1975 ) .",
    "the temperature distribution in the shell is determined iteratively on the bases of the eddington solution for the plane slab , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the effective temperature .",
    "the shell density is assumed to be equal @xmath53 in line with the density jump in the strong radiation - dominated shock .",
    "after the shock break out of the cs envelope ( @xmath54 ) the shell density is set to be @xmath55 implied by the free expansion .",
    "the system of equations of motion , energy , and mass conservation is solved by runge - kutta of 4-th order . in every case",
    "the energy is conserved with the accuracy of 1% .    to test the model we calculated the result of a central explosive release of @xmath56 erg in the uniform envelope of @xmath57 and the radius of @xmath58 cm .",
    "the explosion is simulated by the kinetic energy of @xmath59 shell . in this formulation",
    "the modelling in the framework of the radiation hydrodynamic is available ( chevalier 1976 , model a ) .",
    "the light curve in our model slightly differs from that of the model a but the length of the plateau in both models ( 57 days ) coinside within one day . despite its simplicity",
    "our model thus catches the essence of the acceleration dynamics and the light curve produced by the explosion in an extended envelope .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "sn  2011ht parameter estimates recovered above are used here for two illustrative models , m1 and m2 ( cf .",
    "table and fig.1 ) .",
    "the table contains the explosion energy and mass of sn ejecta , the mass of the cs envelope , its radius @xmath60 , the power index @xmath61 of the density distribution , @xmath62 , in the range of @xmath63 , and the radiated energy . in both models @xmath64 while @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the model m1 with the ejecta mass of @xmath59 in fact simulates the central explosion since the kinetic energy of the low mass ejecta is rapidly ( @xmath67 d ) thermalized .",
    "the aggregated mass of the supernova ejecta and cs envelope is @xmath68 in both models .",
    "the models sensibly reproduce the total radiated energy ( cf .",
    "table ) and the observed expansion velocity of sn  2011ht after day 30 .",
    "both models however have apparent drawbacks : the plateau is uacceptably long and the shape of the light curve is unlike the observed one .",
    "particularly , the model does not show the hump at about day 50 .",
    "note , the late hump of the model light curve at the plateau end is related to the sharp drop of the opacity with the temperature decrease around @xmath69  k.    the comparison of our simplified model with hydrodynamic simulation in the previous section suggests that the strong disagrement between the model and observed plateau duration is unlikely , although can not be rulled out completely .",
    "the problem with the light curve description might arise because some relevant physics is not included in our model .",
    "we admit that the missing factor is the fragmentation of the swept - up shell as a result of either the rayleigh - taylor instability arising from the rapid deceleration of the shell ( fig.1 ) , or the thin shell instability in the case of the radiative forward shock ( vishniac 1983 ) .",
    "the outcome of the fragmentation is the decrease of the shell effective optical depth and , as a result , rapid radiation diffusion and larger luminosity at the early epoch .",
    "the fragmentation effect in the light curve can be implemented using the following description .",
    "a homogeneous spherical layer with the optical depth @xmath70 breaks down into spherical fragments of a radius @xmath71 with @xmath72 to be the number density of fragments . the gas density in fragments",
    "is assumed to be the same as in the smooth shell , while the intercloud density to be negligibly small .",
    "the average number of clouds along the shell radius is then @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the shell thickness .",
    "using @xmath75 one can write the expression for the effective optical depth of the cloudy shell ( cf . chugai & chevalier 2005 ) as @xmath76\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq - tauef}\\ ] ] this expression deviates from the exact one ( utrobin & chugai 2015 ) by less than 3% . in the limit of @xmath77",
    "the relation ( 4 ) reproduces the optical depth of the smooth shell , @xmath78 , while for @xmath79 the effective optical depth is reduced to average number of clouds along the shell radius , @xmath80 .",
    "the fragmentation evolution is described via the time dependence of @xmath75 @xmath81\\,.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath82 is set to meet the requirement @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the initial optical depth of the smooth shell .",
    "we assume @xmath85 and @xmath86 : the choice guaratees that at the early epoch @xmath87 is equal to the optical depth of the smooth shell .",
    "this description suggests that the fragmentation becomes significant at the stage @xmath88 .",
    "the fragmentation effect in the light curve is demonstrated by models m3f and m4f ( table , fig.2 ) in comparison with models m3 and m4 without fragmentation .",
    "models m3f and m4f differ by the intitial density distribution of the cs envelope : in the model m3f the density is uniform ( @xmath64 ) , while in the model m4f @xmath89 .",
    "the fragmentation time is @xmath90  d in the model m3f and 10 days in the model m4f .",
    "model light curves describe better principal features of the observed light curve : maximum at about day 50 and the plateau duration .",
    "the shell expansion velocity in both models is close to 600 km s@xmath9 , in accord with observations .",
    "note that the velocity exit on the constant regime in the model m4f occurs later than both in the model m3f and observations ; we therefore conclude that the model m3f is preferred .",
    "exercises with different ejecta mass confirm an obvious guess : a model with larger mass exits to the constant velocity later because of the larger momentum .",
    "the model m3f exits to the constant velocity at about day 30 , and thus demonstrates that the ejecta mass can not exceed significantly @xmath91 . at the luminosity maximum ( @xmath92 d )",
    "the effective temperature in the model m3f is @xmath69  k in agreement with the temperature inferred from the spectral energy distribution ( mauerhan et al .",
    "this additionally lends credibility that the model reflects basic physics of sn  2011ht phenomenon .    for the model verification of great interest",
    "is the early stage @xmath93 that preceeds complete sweeping of the cs envelope , i.e. , when the thin shell radius @xmath94 . in the model",
    "m3f this stage corresponds to @xmath95 d ( fig.2 ) .",
    "our scenario predicts that at @xmath93 the photosphere radius is constant and equal to @xmath60 , while the velocity at the photosphere should coinside with the velocity of the undisturbed cs envelope , which is presumably small .",
    "we expect in this case that the spectrum at @xmath93 with the resolution @xmath96 km s@xmath9 will not reveal absorption lines , while core of emission hydrogen lines will be narrower than at the late time , @xmath97 .",
    "summing up , the radiated energy and the low expansion velocity of sn  2011ht are consistent with the explosion of supernova of low energy ( @xmath0 erg ) in the cs envelope of the radius @xmath3 cm with the total mass of the swept - up shell of @xmath98 .",
    "in the proposed scenario the shock wave sweeps up the cs envelope in the initial 20 - 30 days .",
    "after that the shell expands freely with the velocity of @xmath99 km",
    "s@xmath9 and kinematics of @xmath37 . the hydrogen line emission produced by the shell with the large thomson optical depth , and the hydrogen absorption arising from the external rarefied layer can provide us with an additional test of the sn  2011ht model .",
    "the monte carlo technique is used below to model hydrogen line profiles .",
    "compared to the similar modelling of h@xmath6 formed in the cocoon of sn  1998s with the thomson optical depth of @xmath100 ( chugai 2001 ) , in the case of sn  2011ht the optical depth of the emitting shell is tremendous ( @xmath101 ) , so one has to take into account the true absorption of quanta between scatterings .",
    "this process is modelled by introducing the absorption probability @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the coefficients of absorption and thomson scattering respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the shell consists of two components : optically thick ( @xmath105 ) spherical layer in the velocity range of @xmath106 and the optically thin ( @xmath107 ) external layer in the velocity range @xmath108 responsible for the absorption component .",
    "the ratio of line and continuum emission coefficients is assumed to be constant in the envelope ; the electron temperature is set to be @xmath69  k.    as an example we consider the spectrum of sn  2011ht on day 37 ( mauerhan et al . 2013 ) . according to the model m3f at this stage the shell optical depth is @xmath109 .",
    "we adopt @xmath110 and note that the variation of this value in the range of factor three does not affect the result significantly . the resonance optical depth in lines",
    "is assumed to be very large in the range of @xmath111 .",
    "computations of the h@xmath6 profile for the extended set of parameters led us to the optimal choice @xmath112 km s@xmath9 , @xmath113 km s@xmath9 , @xmath114 km s@xmath9 , and @xmath115 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "to model h@xmath20 one has to take into account that the absorption probability should be smaller than in the h@xmath6 band because the absorption is determined primarily by the paschen continuum . if one takes into account only this absorption mechanism then for the h@xmath20 band one gets @xmath116 .",
    "however , the h@xmath20 calculated with this value shows very strong broad wings due to large number of scatterings on thermal electrons .",
    "the best agreement with the observed spectrum is found for @xmath117 . the absorption coefficient is larger than the paschen value possibly because of the contribution of numerous metall lines in this band . with the correction for the uncertainty of @xmath36 for h@xmath20",
    ", we find that both h@xmath6 and h@xmath20 are well described by the unified model of the sn  2011ht consistent with the light curve model as regards principal parameters ( velocity , temperature , and optical depth ) .",
    "this success demonstrates advantage of the scenario b over scenario a : in the latter h@xmath20 profile could not be reproduced solely by the emission and scattering in the undisturbed cs envelope ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) .     and",
    "h@xmath20 ( _ thick _ line ) compared to the observed spectrum ( mauerhan et al . 2013 ) .",
    "small excess of the observed flux in the red wing of h@xmath6 at about 5000 km s@xmath9 is caused by the presence of weak hei 6678   line .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the goal of the paper was the answer to the question , whether the light curve and spectra of supernovae iin - p were consistent with the scenario b prompted by the idea of dessart et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that the spectrum of sn  1994w formed in the slowly expanding envelope ( @xmath118 km s@xmath9 ) . in the thin shell approximation with radiative diffusion",
    "a simple model was developed to compute the luminosity and dynamics of sn  2011ht .",
    "the modelling demonstrates that the light curve and the low expansion velocity are consistent with the low energy explosion ( @xmath119 erg ) and ejected mass @xmath1 occured in the cs envelope with the radius of @xmath3 cm and the mass of @xmath2 . in this scenario a better agreement with the observed light curve is achieved , if one admits the shell fragmentation .",
    "the issue of instabilities that give rise to the fragmentation is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it should be emphasised also that we can not rule out that in the framework of the radiation hydrodynamics one will be able to reproduce all the observations without invoking fragmentation .",
    "the scenario b of the low energy explosion applied to sn  2011ht notably differ from the scenario a proposed for sn  1994w ( chugai et al .",
    "major differencies of the new scenario from the old one are : ( i ) factor ten lower energy and , as a result , the lower expansion velocity ( @xmath118 km s@xmath9 ) , ( ii ) factor ten smaller radius of the cs envelope , and last but not least ( iii ) the line emitting region in the new scenario is the massive ( @xmath120 ) shell accelerated by supernova explosion , while in the old scenario it was the undisturbed cs envelope with the mass of @xmath121 . the scenario b is favourable by two reasons .",
    "first , late time spectra ( @xmath15 d ) of sn  iin - p do not show high expansion velocities which is a serious problem for the scenario a. second , the emission of hydrogen lines by the low velocity optically thick shell permits one to describe all the hydrogen lines as demonstrated by the modelling of the h@xmath6 and h@xmath20 lines .",
    "in contrast , in the scenario a the h@xmath20 and h@xmath6 lines can not be reproduced simultaneously in the model of the emitting undisturbed cs envelope .",
    "the concept of the low energy explosion for sn  iin - p events has been proposed earlier by smith ( 2013 ) ; he attributes this subclass along with the sn  1054 ( crab ) to the electron - capture supernovae .",
    "remarkably , the scenario b admits an observational test .",
    "it is based on the prediction that at the early stage preceeding the total acceleration of the cs envelope , i.e. , at @xmath122 days , the radial velocities of line absorptions should be equal to the expansion velocity of the undisturbed cs envelope , while the core of hydrogen emission lines should be significantly narrower than at the later epoch ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the genesis of sn  iin - p is an open issue .",
    "sollerman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have mentioned two possibilities for sn  1994w : star with the initial mass from the range of @xmath123 with a core collapsing to the neutron star , or massive star ( @xmath124 ) leaving behind the black hole .",
    "both scenario account for the absence of large amount of ejected @xmath125ni . from the point of view of producing a close massive cs envelope",
    "the progenitor with the mass of @xmath126 is preferred .",
    "indeed , several years prior to the sn outburst the explosive flash of degenerate neon may result in the ejection all the pre - sn envelope ( woosley et al .",
    "2002 ) ; for the massive star @xmath127 that heavy mass loss prior to the collapse is unlikely because the final nuclear burning occurs in non - degenerate fashion . in the case of @xmath126 progenitor",
    "the cs envelope with the radius of @xmath128 cm forms by 3 yr prior to collapse provided the mass outflow velocity is 20 km s@xmath9 .",
    "notably , the low explosion energy of sn  2011ht ( @xmath129 erg ) is consistent with the prediction of neutrino mechanism for @xmath130 progenitor ( kitaura et al .",
    "yet , it is noteworthy , that the collapse of massive star ( @xmath127 ) also can produce weak explosion ( woosley et al .",
