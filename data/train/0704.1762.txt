    "gv tau ( haro 6 - 10 , iras 04263@xmath62426 ) is an unusual young t tauri binary system partly embedded in the l1524 molecular cloud .",
    "it is one of a small number of young binaries for which the primary ( gv tau s ) is optically visible and the infrared companion ( irc , gv tau n ) , located 1@xmath72 to the north , is strongly extincted .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the primary is flat or rising in the 1100  @xmath8 m  range , suggesting that it is a class i object @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the irc was generally brighter than the primary at wavelengths longer than @xmath34  @xmath8 m .",
    "it has also been found that the system is variable , particularly in the near infrared , and on timescales as short as a month @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the primary became redder as it became fainter at k. also , the depth of the 3  @xmath8 m  ice band was found to vary with time , and their results suggested that an increase in optical depth corresponded to a decrease in k brightness . both of these measurements are consistent with the dominant mechanism of the variability of gv tau s being due to inhomogeneities in circumstellar material that result in changes in extinction .",
    "the behavior for the irc is more complex and suggests the possibility of variable accretion mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the system shows a parsec - scale herbig - haro flow with a well - defined axis , as well as other smaller flows , one of which is associated with the irc , and one that does not appear to be associated with either object @xcite .",
    "near - infrared emission images suggest the presence of a flattened circumbinary envelope with a semi - major axis of @xmath310001500  au seen nearly edge - on as the source of the observed polarization and part of the extinction toward both objects @xcite .",
    "we note that their observations do not exclude the additional presence of circumstellar disks around one or both objects .    in this paper",
    "we report high - resolution near - infrared detections of co , hcn , and c@xmath0h@xmath0  toward gv tau s. for the irc , co was detected in absorption , but hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  were not . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observations and data analysis . in section 3",
    "we present the results of analysis for hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , and co , along with upper limits for ch@xmath4 .",
    "results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "high - dispersion , infrared observations of gv tau were taken with the cryogenic echelle spectrometer nirspec at the 10-meter w. m. keck observatory on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite .",
    "nirspec provides a resolving power of @xmath325,000 , which allows for the clean separation of fundamental and excited states of @xmath9co , @xmath10co , and c@xmath11o as well as the @xmath1 band of hcn and two strong bands of c@xmath0h@xmath0(@xmath1 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "table  [ table1 ] presents the spectral settings , wavelength coverage , and integration times for the spectral orders analyzed in this paper .",
    "the m- and k - band data covering the fundamental and overtone transitions of co , respectively , were acquired in march and august 2003 .",
    "kl band spectra were obtained on february 17 - 18 , 2006 to search for gas phase absorptions due to organic species toward gv tau .",
    "the infrared companion of gv tau was observed simultaneously during the february 17 , 2006 and march 2003 observations , enabling us to characterize the spectra toward both objects .",
    "our reduction and analysis procedures are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we summarize them below .",
    "observations at l and particularly at m band are dominated by a thermal ( @xmath3300 k ) background with sky emission lines superposed . in",
    "order cancel atmospheric and background effects , we nodded the telescope between positions one quarter of the way from the top and bottom of the slit , our `` a '' and `` b '' positions , respectively .",
    "each exposure corresponded to one minute of integration time .",
    "telluric lines were cancelled to first order by combining observations as \\{a - b - b+a}/2 .",
    "a series of flats and darks was taken for each grating setting .",
    "after flatfielding and dark subtraction , systematically hot and dead pixels and cosmic ray hits were removed and the data were resampled to align the spectral and spatial dimensions along rows and columns , respectively .",
    "examples of extracted spectra are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the individual lines of each molecule are labeled .",
    "the atmospheric transmittance function was modeled using the spectrum synthesis program ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ssp ) , which accesses the updated hitran 2000 molecular database @xcite . for each grating setting ,",
    "the column burdens of atmospheric species , the spectral resolving power , and the wavelength calibrations were established by fitting the optimized model . to extract our spectral absorption features , we subtracted the model , convolved to the resolution of the instrument , from the spectral extract .",
    "this results in a residual that is still convolved to the telluric spectrum . for intrinsically narrow lines ,",
    "we obtain the true line intensity incident at the top of the terrestrial atmosphere by dividing each spectral line by the transmittance at the doppler shifted position using the fully resolved model .",
    "the optimized model is shown as the dashed line in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] and has been found to reproduce the telluric spectrum accurately .",
    "we note that the relative continuum brightnesses of the primary and companion varied significantly between our 2003 and 2006 observations .",
    "in particular , the irc was fainter than gv tau s through the 25  @xmath8 m  region .",
    "both objects are known to vary in the infrared @xcite and the variations are thought to be due primarily to variable amounts of intervening gas and dust , essentially clumpy circumbinary material .",
    "@xcite reported that gv tau s got slightly fainter at m band over the period from 1993 - 2000 while the irc was found to get brighter during the same time interval .",
    "a similar trend was seen for both objects at l. in spex data acquired in november 2004 , the infrared companion was substantially fainter than gv tau s throughout the 2 - 5  @xmath8 m  region .",
    "this was also true for our 3.3  @xmath8 m  observations in 2006 .",
    "nonetheless , we were able to extract spectra from both gv tau s and its irc .",
    "the extinction toward gv tau s is relatively small ( a@xmath13 @xmath35.6 mag ) and thus we may also be detecting stellar photospheric absorption lines . to check for possible photospheric lines",
    ", we compared our spectral type k3 gv tau spectra @xcite to a high - resolution k2 spectrum of arcturus @xcite .",
    "the arcturus spectrum was doppler shifted to the geocentric velocity of gv tau as determined by our hcn and co observations , which were found to be consistent with the heliocentric velocity measured by @xcite , and convolved to the resolution of our nirspec data .",
    "broad ( consistent the rotational broadening reported by @xcite ) absorption lines corresponding to photospheric oh and nh were present toward gv tau s ( indicated by crosses and asterisks in figure  2 ) .",
    "contaminated lines were eliminated from our analysis .",
    "the remaining absorption features were measured by fitting a gaussian profile to calculate the equivalent width .",
    "for gv tau s , the fundamental ro - vibrational lines of @xmath9co , @xmath10co , and c@xmath11o near 4.67  @xmath8 m  and the overtone bands near 2.3  @xmath8 m  were observed in absorption in march and august 2003 , respectively ( figure 1 ) .",
    "absorption line studies have the advantage of measuring physical conditions in a pencil - beam column of gas along the line of sight to the emitting source , usually the star and inner accretion disk .",
    "this allows us to sample a long path length through the edge - on circumbinary envelope and circumstellar disk .",
    "the rotational temperatures and column densities of the different bands and isotopes of co were derived using a population analysis and are presented in figure  3 and table  2 . the overall rotational temperature found for co toward gv tau",
    "s is @xmath3200  k , somewhat warmer than that found for hcn ( section 3.2 ) , though within 3-sigma for the overtone lines and lines of c@xmath11o , and consistent with the t@xmath14 found for c@xmath0h@xmath0  ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "this is also similar to the warm ( @xmath3100  k ) temperatures we find toward other flared disk systems @xcite and implies that the gas is located in the inner , potentially planet forming ( @xmath310  au or so ) region of the circumstellar disk rather than in the more distant interstellar or circumbinary material .",
    "the column density of @xmath9co was found to be ( 5.9 @xmath15 1.2 ) x 10@xmath11  @xmath16@xmath17  based on an analysis of the overtone lines , which are optically thin .",
    "the fundamental lines of co are optically thick and require a curve of growth analysis .",
    "we found @xmath9co/@xmath10co to be 54 @xmath15 15 , consistent with that measured toward orion a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath15 3 ) and that found toward the young star hl tau ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath15 9 ) .",
    "the @xmath9co / c@xmath11o ratio is 420 @xmath15 170 , somewhat lower than toward orion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath3660 ) , hl tau ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath15 200 ) , and the canonical interstellar value of 560 @xmath15 25 found by @xcite .",
    "we would expect the isotopic abundance ratios to reflect the isotopic composition of the dense cloud unless influenced by a mechanism such as selective dissociation @xcite , which may occur since the isotopomers are not self - shielded as effectively as @xmath9co .",
    "this effect does not seem to be evident toward gv tau .",
    "the infrared companion was observed at m band in march 2003 , but was not placed in the slit during the k - band observations .",
    "the irc was resolved and @xmath10co was detected , though c@xmath11o was not .",
    "we estimate that the @xmath9co column density is @xmath33x10@xmath11  @xmath16@xmath17 , assuming that the @xmath9co/@xmath10co ratio toward the two objects is the same .",
    "this assumption seems reasonable , given that the @xmath9co lines toward the irc are about half as strong as those toward gv tau s , and in order to bring n(@xmath18 ) for the irc in agreement with the primary , the @xmath9co/@xmath10co ratio would have to be a factor of two higher .",
    "future observations of the overtone co lines toward the irc are planned to directly measure @xmath9co .",
    "rather strong absorption lines due to the hcn ( 100 - 000 ) band near 3.0  @xmath8 m  were detected toward gv tau s. spectral extracts are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the geocentric doppler shifted positions ( + 49 km / s ) of the hcn absorption lines and the specific identifications are indicated by solid ticks .",
    "we performed a rotational analysis on absorption features that were at transmittance @xmath1980% , were not blended with c@xmath0h@xmath0  transitions ( also indicated in figure 2 ) , and were clear of contamination from stellar absorption features as determined from a comparison to the similar spectral type high - resolution arcturus spectrum of @xcite .",
    "there were a total of 10 lines that satisfied these criteria , ranging from j=0 - 7 .",
    "einstein a s and line positions were taken from the ab initio line list calculated by @xcite , which expanded on previous line lists and improved accuracy by using the most accurate potential energy surface and dipole moment surface information available .",
    "the population diagram is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the doppler shifted positions and equivalent widths used are given in table 3 .",
    "we note that the lines in our analysis are optically thin for most reasonable values of the intrinsic line widths ( b ) .",
    "for example , the r6 line is optically thin ( @xmath20 ) for all b @xmath19 1.7 km / s .",
    "for r1 , @xmath21 is achieved only for b @xmath5 0.9 km / s .",
    "@xcite found b = 1.3@xmath150.1 for co toward hl tau .",
    "@xcite find that no good fit can be made to the c@xmath0h@xmath0  and co profiles for b @xmath5 2 km / s .",
    "@xcite find that 0.8@xmath5b@xmath51.5 km / s toward l1489 to explain the co observations . if we make a reasonable assumption that b@xmath191 km / s , then our absorptions are optically thin .",
    "this is also supported by the linearity of the population diagram . from this",
    ", we derive a rotational temperature of 115@xmath22  k and a total hcn column density of ( 3.7@xmath150.3 ) x 10@xmath23  @xmath16@xmath17  toward gv tau s. comparing this to the co column density ( section 3.1 ) provides an hcn / co @xmath3 0.63%      interestingly , hcn absorption was not seen toward the infrared companion star . if we assume the same t@xmath14 as found for the primary ( 115  k ) , the 3-sigma upper limit for the hcn column density toward the infrared companion is 4.8 x 10@xmath24  @xmath16@xmath17 , a factor of about 8 lower than the primary .",
    "the estimated co column density toward the irc is a factor of two less than toward gv tau s. if we assume that the co absorption originates in the inner circumstellar disk of each object , then the resulting difference in hcn column densities implies that hcn is at least a factor of four less abundant toward the irc .",
    "this result is important .",
    "the fact that the hcn column density is significantly lower toward the irc is a strong constraint that argues for the hcn being located in the warm inner disk of the primary , rather than in the interstellar medium or the circumbinary material that surrounds both objects .",
    "this result may suggest that there are significant compositional differences between the inner disk ( @xmath310  au or so ) material toward the two objects .",
    "however , we point out that caution must be used when comparing the primary to the irc .",
    "there is no a priori reason to assume the same gas temperature toward both objects if the gas is associated with a circumstellar disk rather than the circumbinary material .",
    "the irc was not located in the slit during our kl2 observation ( table  1 ) .",
    "this means that only the j@xmath58 transitions of hcn were covered . due to the fact that only low j lines were sampled toward the irc ,",
    "the upper limit is less constrained for higher temperatures .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we assume t=400  k , then the upper limit for n(hcn ) becomes @xmath31.1x10@xmath25  @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "we attempted to detect ch@xmath4  in our kl , order 25 setting , which covered several transitions . with a geocentric doppler shift of + 49 km / s during the observations ,",
    "the lines should have been shifted out of the telluric features to transmittances ranging from @xmath360% for p2 up to @xmath380% for r0 and p1 to 86% for r1 . from this",
    ", we calculated a 3-sigma upper limit for the ch@xmath4  column density of @xmath52.2 x 10@xmath23  @xmath16@xmath17  using the methodology discussed in @xcite and assuming the same rotational temperature as that found for hcn ( 115  k ) . when compared with the hcn and co we find that ch@xmath4/hcn",
    "@xmath5 60% and ch@xmath4/co @xmath5 0.37% .",
    "this is not as well constrained as the gas phase ch@xmath4/co ratio found for hl tau @xcite , but it is still substantially smaller than the overall ch@xmath4/co ratio found for comets @xcite and somewhat lower than reported for ch@xmath4/co ( ice+gas ) for massive ysos by @xcite .",
    "there are two comparably strong bands of acetylene in the 3  @xmath8mregion : the @xmath1 band centered at 3294.84  @xmath26  and the @xmath27 + @xmath28 band centered at 3281.90  @xmath26  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ordinarily , the @xmath1 band would be 1100 times stronger than the combination mode .",
    "however , a fermi resonance between the two bands causes the combination band to become slightly stronger than the @xmath1 band @xcite .    from the analysis of the 3  @xmath8 m  spectra ( figure 2 ) ,",
    "a number of unblended lines of c@xmath0h@xmath0  are detected at relatively good transmittance ( @xmath1980% ) .",
    "the positions of individual c@xmath0h@xmath0lines are indicated in figure 3 ( dot - dash ticks ) .",
    "we analyzed 15 unblended lines with high transmittance from the @xmath27 + @xmath29 band and 4 lines of the @xmath1 band to determine the column density ( figure 5 , table 4 ) .",
    "we also checked for possible contamination due to stellar photospheric features by comparison with an arcturus spectrum .",
    "the rotational temperature analysis yielded a t@xmath14 = 170@xmath30  k , which is consistent with those found for hcn and co within the uncertainty , and a total column density of ( 7.3@xmath31 ) x 10@xmath23  @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "these values are consistent with the non - detection of the @xmath1 p18 line , which is at 97% transmittance and unblended .",
    "the predicted equivalent width of p18 , based on the fit in figure 5 , is 0.0011  @xmath26 , within the 1-sigma noise limit of 0.0014  @xmath26 .",
    "we investigated the composition of several organic molecules toward the binary t tauri system gv tau .",
    "such species as hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , and ch@xmath4  are key to understanding the chemical compositions and evolution of the volatile material that becomes incorporated into the planet forming regions of disks around young stars .",
    "we detected hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  toward the primary and provide upper limits for the irc .",
    "this is only the second reported detection of these species in the gas phase toward a low mass t tauri star .",
    "the first reported detection of these molecules was via spitzer irs observations toward irs 46 in the @xmath32 ophiuchus cloud @xcite .",
    "the warm temperatures ( @xmath3400  k for hcn and @xmath3800  k for c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) suggested a possible disk origin for the absorptions , but were not definitive as @xcite could not distinguish whether the gas was located in the disk or a jet .      in february 2006 , hcn was detected toward the primary ( gv tau s , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however for the irc , which was observed simultaneously , the lack of a detection suggests a significant lower total column density if we assume the same rotational temperature .",
    "similarly , the co spectra toward gv tau s and the irc are significantly different , suggesting a factor of two difference in column density , resulting in a factor of at least four lower abundance toward the irc .",
    "this result is a strong indication that the hcn is located close to gv tau s , within the circumstellar flared disk , and not associated with the irc ( and therefore not in the circumbinary material ) .",
    "the warm rotational temperatures of @xmath33100 - 200  k determined for hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , and co also suggest a location in the inner region of the disk that surrounds gv tau s rather than in the circumbinary envelope .",
    "a jet origin can likely be eliminated as the doppler shifts of stellar photospheric absorption lines agree with those found for the intervening molecular material to within @xmath35 km / s .",
    "we derive a heliocentric radial velocity of 21@xmath155 km / s for co and 19.5@xmath153.4 for hcn .",
    "this is similar the heliocentric doppler shift of 13.4@xmath153.8 km / s reported by @xcite using high resolution optical spectra of stellar emission lines .",
    "the combination of velocity information , significantly different compositions toward closely spaced objects , and warm rotational temperatures combine to argue that the hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , and co are located in the disk of gv tau s.    if we assume that the near - infrared variability toward gv tau is due primarily to cooler material in the outer disk or circumbinary envelope rather than the warm material where the co , hcn , and c@xmath0h@xmath0  absorptions originate , as suggested by the 3  @xmath8 m ice feature variability , then we can compare our column densities of hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  to co ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we must be cautious with such an interpretation , however , since our co ( 2 and 5  @xmath8 m ) observations and our 3  @xmath8 m  observations were taken at different times and the sources are both highly variable in the infrared over short time scales .",
    "this could affect the amount of gaseous material in the line of sight .",
    "for example , tidal interactions between the two stars , which are only separated by about 170 au , may affect the gas structure close to the stars .",
    "perhaps the temperature and density structures of the inner disks differ , resulting in dissimilar chemical evolution .",
    "it may also be possible that an inner circumstellar disk of the irc is more inclined than the nearly edge - on gv tau s and that we are seeing warm co in the flared disk .",
    "the molecules in disk atmospheres are less protected from energetic photons than those in the midplane , leading to higher photodissociation rates .",
    "collisional dissociation in the inner disk may act to remove hydrogen atoms from molecules like c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn .",
    "also , the increased production of ions in disk atmospheres and the resulting ion - molecule chemistry will further modify the composition .",
    "the extent to which these processes occur is dependent on the local ionizing radiation field , temperature , and density ( see papers by @xcite for discussion of chemistry in protoplanetary disks ) .",
    "hence , the chemistry is dependent on radial and vertical distances in the disk and our measurements are correspondingly dependent on viewing geometry",
    ". additional observations to simultaneously measure co and hcn toward gv tau are planned to address this issue and to investigate the possibility of variations in column densities of gaseous species .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results for gv tau s to those found toward other young stars , models of chemistry in protoplanetary disks , and comets in our own solar system .",
    "assuming that co , hcn , and c@xmath0h@xmath0  originate in the same region , we found a c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn ratio of @xmath32.0 toward gv tau s and hcn / co @xmath3 0.63% and c@xmath0h@xmath0/co @xmath3 1.2% .",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn was found to be @xmath30.6 toward irs 46 @xcite , another low mass object , assuming that both species originate in the same region .",
    "the 13 - 14  @xmath8 m  q - branches and band heads of c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn were studied by iso @xcite toward massive ysos . in general , c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn for the warm component was found to be @xmath340 - 50% toward most objects .",
    "interestingly , hcn was found to be more abundant ( @xmath32.5% ) toward irs 46 compared to co ( this is a lower limit ) .",
    "this can be seen graphically in figure  [ fig6 ] . in that figure",
    ", c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn is indicated by asterisks while the abundances of c@xmath0h@xmath0  and hcn relative to co ( in % ) are indicated by filled squares and diamonds , respectively .",
    "@xcite modeled molecular distributions of abundant species in the inner 10 au of protostellar disks surrounding t tauri stars . @xcite",
    "measured an upper limit for ch@xmath4/co toward hl tau that was significantly lower than predicted by the model .",
    "the same was found for gv",
    "tau s , where ch@xmath4/co @xmath5 0.0037 is much smaller than the ch@xmath4/co @xmath31 predicted by markwick through most of the inner disk .",
    "however , we find that hcn / co , c@xmath0h@xmath0/co , and c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn ratios toward gv tau s are in general agreement with the range of abundances found in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "our rotational temperatures ( @xmath3100 - 200  k ) are also consistent with the midplane temperatures in the inner @xmath35  au of the protoplanetary disk in the markwick model .",
    "we note , however that we are likely sampling a region above the midplane , possibly in a disk atmosphere , which may be heated by various mechanisms such as viscous accretion , x - rays , or an x - wind ( see @xcite for a discussion of disk heating ) .",
    "this would move the location of the gas outward by an amount depending on the local environment . nonetheless , the similarity in abundances between @xcite , gv tau , and irs 46 is interesting and should be pursued further .    another interesting comparison is with comets in our own solar system .",
    "comets are generally considered to be the most pristine objects in the solar system and are thought to have formed in the giant - planet region ( from @xmath35 - 30  au ) .",
    "infrared spectroscopy has routinely measured abundances of co , hcn , and c@xmath0h@xmath0  toward comets for the last decade ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  abundances measured in comets ( compared to water ) are fairly consistent over the oort cloud population measured to date and the c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn ratio is found to be typically @xmath30.9 - 1.1 , reasonably consistent with the c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn ratios of 0.6 and 2.0 found for irs 46 and gv tau , respectively .",
    "the co abundance in comets has been found to be highly variable , likely as a result of thermal history and processing of comets in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the resulting hcn / co and c@xmath0h@xmath0/co ratios range from @xmath30.01 - 0.16 .",
    "the hcn / co and c@xmath0h@xmath0/co ratios found in gv tau and irs 46 are consistent with those found for co rich comets .",
    "it is possible that the more volatile co was preferentially lost in comets for which the hcn / co or c@xmath0h@xmath0/co ratios are high .",
    "if we assume that the comets with the greatest abundance of co more closely represent the initial volatile abundance of the giant - planet forming region of the solar nebula , the resulting c@xmath0h@xmath0/hcn , c@xmath0h@xmath0/co , and hcn / co ratios agree to within a factor of two with those found for gv tau s , irs 46 , massive ysos , and several of the markwick model results .    also of interest is ch@xmath4 , another particularly volatile molecule for which the abundance ( relative to water ) has been observed to be highly variable in comets ( by over an order of magnitude ) . while the magnitude of the abundance variation is similar to that found for co in comets ,",
    "the two molecules are not correlated @xcite . in comets ch@xmath4/co",
    "is found to vary from @xmath30.050.8 , much higher than in hl tau ( @xmath50.0002 in the gas phase ) or gv tau s ( @xmath50.0037 ) , and lower than the ch@xmath4/co@xmath31 found by @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath4/hcn is found to vary from @xmath325 among comets yet is @xmath50.6 toward gv tau s. the reasons for these compositional differences are unknown and more work must be done to characterize volatiles toward comets and low mass star forming regions .",
    "we have measured column densities and rotational temperatures for co , hcn , and c@xmath0h@xmath0  and an upper limit for ch@xmath4  toward gv tau s. we find that the absorptions are consistent with an origin in the inner region of a protoplanetary disk .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of absorptions due to organic species toward the infrared companion to gv tau s , though gas phase co is present .",
    "the upper limit for hcn toward the irc may suggest compositional differences between the two objects , though a different temperature or viewing geometry can not be ruled out .",
    "we note that gv tau is variable in the near - infrared , likely due to inhomogeneities in the circumbinary material or outer disk .",
    "future observations at m and l band are planned to test whether the variability affects the column densities and abundances of the gas phase species reported in this paper .",
    "we find that the abundances of hcn and c@xmath0h@xmath0  relative to each other and to co are similar to those found among the comet population , that found toward low mass object irs 46 by @xcite , and consistent with the disk model by @xcite .",
