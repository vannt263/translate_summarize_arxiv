    "when  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 are integers ,  @xmath24 reduces to the classical anisotropic homogeneous sobolev space defined by the semi - norm  @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , if  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 are integers , then @xmath28    inequalities   are homogeneous not in a usual sense , they are _ anisotropic _ homogeneous . the transformations that preserve the right - hand side of   ( and thus have to preserve the left - hand side ) are not of the form  @xmath29 , but of the form  @xmath30 .",
    "the basic theory of such type embedding theorems can be found , e.g. in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite , where the case of the limiting order summation exponent is considered )",

    "the `` if '' part of this theorem was proved in the preprint  @xcite .",

    "usually , if one has an embedding into  @xmath49 , then it is natural to expect that it is also valid for all other pairs  @xmath50 that satisfy equation   ( for example , all the embedding theorems from  @xcite and  @xcite are of this type ) .",
    "however , here this principle does not work , mainly due to the fact that we are working with bilinear embeddings .",

    "we signalize that  @xmath56 does not follow from this inequality ( because by theorem  [ t3 ] the former statement may not hold ) ; the multiplicative and the additive forms are not equivalent here .",
    "when we consider non - elliptic cases and  @xmath57 ( the case  @xmath58 is special ) , we are working with something like the strichartz estimates ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this hints us that the treatment of non - elliptic cases will lead us to some oscillatory integrals ( fortunately , one - dimensional ) that are unavoidable when dealing with the strichartz estimates . however , the main difficulty is still the  @xmath10-space on the right - hand side of  .",

    "the text is organized as follows : in section  [ selliptic ] we deal with the elliptic case ( prove theorem  [ t3 ] ) ; in section  [ svanish ] we work on non - ellipticity cases ; finally , in section  [ sfurther ] , we give an explanation why our results for non - elliptic cases are not complete and give some related results and conjectures for linear and quadratic inequalities . in this last section",
    "we omit detailed proofs , but provide sketches ( the results presented there are incomplete , they need further study ; moreover , this is a related , but different story ) .",
    "this paper is of technical character : we believe that neither the statements nor the proofs presented here are general enough ( the worst thing is that we are working not with many variables , but with only two of them ) .",
    "however , the effect itself ( especially for non - elliptic cases ) seems to be new in its nature .",
    "both these facts urge us to write down too many details in sections  [ selliptic ] and  [ svanish ] , we apologize for that .",
    "i am grateful to my scientific adviser s. v.  kislyakov for statement of the problem and attention to my work and to a. i. nazarov for useful comments .",
    "we are going to prove theorem  [ t3 ] in the following order : first , we prove that  @xmath32 holds if the parameters satisfy the assumptions ; second , we construct counterexamples that disprove  @xmath32 in all the remaining cases .",
    "unfortunately , we did not manage to formalize the latter part in a good way : though the ideology of the counterexample is clear , the technical treatment varies for different cases of parameters .",
    "at least one of the numbers  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 is odd ; by symmetry , we may suppose that  @xmath11 is odd .",
    "in what follows , we assume that  @xmath41 and  @xmath39 are distinct ( the case where they are equal is a bit different , we treat it afterwards ) .",
    "the functions  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 belong to the schwartz class , so , their fourier transform is infinitely differentiable and decays rapidly at infinity . thus , we can represent the scalar product on left - hand side of   as a limit , @xmath63 where  @xmath64 .",
    "next , we replace the fourier transforms in the integrand by their expressions in terms of  @xmath65 and  @xmath66 found from the formulas @xmath67 so , the expression  @xmath68 coincides with the right - hand side of",
    ". we must estimate the quantity @xmath69 the denominator of the integrand does not vanish on  @xmath0 except at zero , due to the assumptions of ellipticity . then ( for  @xmath70 and  @xmath71 fixed ) we replace  @xmath72 and  @xmath73 in the last formula by their definitions in terms of  @xmath65 and  @xmath66 , and change the order of integration : @xmath74 where @xmath75 to prove inequality  , we must show that the modulus of the quantity does not exceed the value  @xmath76 . for this , we prove that the function is bounded uniformly in all  @xmath77 and  @xmath71 , @xmath78 , and almost all quads of reals  @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the things become slightly more transparent if we integrate in   first with respect to  @xmath81 and then with respect to  @xmath82 , and in the inner integral introduce a new variable  @xmath83 by setting  @xmath84 .",
    "this yields the formula @xmath85 where we have put  @xmath86 ,  @xmath87 , and  @xmath39 and  @xmath41 were introduced in definition  [ ellipticity ] .    here",
    "integration in  @xmath82 is over the union  @xmath88\\cup [ \\varepsilon , r]$ ] , and we will prove the boundedness of the integral over each of these two intervals separately .",
    "because of symmetry , we consider only the interval  @xmath89 $ ] ( then  @xmath90 in the denominator disappears ) . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that @xmath91 ( the opposite case reduces to this one if we change @xmath83 by @xmath92 ; note that we may drop the case of @xmath93 because it corresponds to a set of measure @xmath38 ) .",
    "after that , we take @xmath94 for a new variable in the outer integral ; this will modify the parameters @xmath95 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , but will allow us to assume that @xmath96 .",
    "so , finally , we must show that the following integral is bounded uniformly in  @xmath77 ,  @xmath71 ,  @xmath97 , and  @xmath95 : @xmath98 we will calculate the integral with respect to  @xmath83 with the help of the residue formula , perceiving  @xmath83 as a complex variable . since the integrand decays rapidly at infinity in the upper half - plane , integration over the contour that consists of the interval  @xmath99 $ ] and the upper part of the circle of radius  @xmath100 and centered at zero shows , after the limit passage as  @xmath101 , that the integral in question is  @xmath102 times the sum of the residues at the poles of the integrand in the upper half - plane .",
    "all these poles are simple and are  @xmath11th roots of  @xmath39 or  @xmath41 ( we have assumed that  @xmath103 ) .",
    "let  @xmath104 ( and  @xmath105 ) .",
    "perceiving the integrand in question as  @xmath106 with  @xmath107 , we use the fact that  @xmath23 is regular at  @xmath108 to conclude that the residue at  @xmath108 is @xmath109 similarly , if  @xmath110 ( and  @xmath111 ) , the residue at  @xmath112 is equal to @xmath113 under our assumptions on  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 , the equations  @xmath114 and  @xmath115 have one and the same number of roots in the upper half plane .",
    "this shows that , up to a constant factor , the integral   is equal to a sum of  @xmath116 expressions of the form @xmath117 where  @xmath108 and  @xmath112 are some  @xmath11th roots of , respectively ,  @xmath39 and  @xmath41 in the upper half - plane ( note that , happily , the denominators in the above two formulas for residues are opposite to each other ) .",
    "we recall that  @xmath95 is real , so we estimate the absolute value of the integrand by  @xmath118 when  @xmath119 and by  @xmath120 when  @xmath121 . both integrals  @xmath122 and  @xmath123 converge .",
    "this finishes the proof of  @xmath56 when  @xmath11 is odd and  @xmath41 and  @xmath39 are distinct numbers with imaginary parts of the same sign .",
    "the case where  @xmath124 can be treated in a similar way . in this case , all the poles of the function  @xmath125 are of the second order . after calculations ,",
    "the two - dimensional integral   appears to be a linear combination of one - dimensional integrals of the form @xmath126 alternatively , this can be justified by passing to the limit as  @xmath127 in formula  .",
    "this integral is uniformly bounded , again because  @xmath128 .",
    "in fact , we have proved that the distribution  @xmath129 defined by formula @xmath130 has bounded fourier transform .",
    "we did not formulate this as a statement , because it is not clear a priori why does formula   define a distribution . by the classical malgrange ",
    "ehrenpreis theorem @xmath131 is a distribution belonging to  @xmath132 ( and even to  @xmath133 , see  ) , however , it is not clear whether it can be multiplied by a non - smooth function  @xmath134 .",
    "assume that  @xmath17 holds .",
    "in this case , we know that  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 must satisfy equation  . in this subsection , we construct a pair of functions  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 ( depending on the parameters ) that will give further restrictions on the numbers  @xmath135 .",
    "we also suppose that if at least one of the numbers  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 is even , then  @xmath12 is even .",
    "let  @xmath23 ,  @xmath136 , be an infinitely differentiable compactly supported function on  @xmath137 equal to  @xmath138 near zero .",
    "we put  @xmath139 and  @xmath140 , where  @xmath141 should be thought of as a large number .",
    "next , let  @xmath142 , and let  @xmath143 .",
    "then the  @xmath144-norm of  @xmath145 is dominated by a constant independent of  @xmath146 . at the same time ,  @xmath147 is equal to  @xmath38 near the origin and is equal to  @xmath138 on a large set if  @xmath146 is large .",
    "note also that  @xmath148 for some  @xmath149 .",
    "now , we find two functions  @xmath150 from the equations @xmath151 these equations are easily solvable after passage to fourier transforms : @xmath152 and it is clear that the solutions are in the schwartz class indeed ( recall that the polynomials in the denominators do not have zeros except  @xmath38 ) .    now ,",
    "inequality   with these  @xmath153 and  @xmath154 yields @xmath155 independently of  @xmath146 .",
    "we transform the integral as we did it before , including the change of variables  @xmath156 , to obtain @xmath157 the power  @xmath158 in the outer integral arises after a short calculation involving equation  , and the signs of  @xmath82 in the denominator disappear , if  @xmath12 is even ( if both  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 are odd , then one has twice the same integral after splitting the integral with respect to  @xmath82 into integrals over  @xmath159 $ ] and  @xmath160 and making the change of variable  @xmath161 in the first one ) . changing the order of integration",
