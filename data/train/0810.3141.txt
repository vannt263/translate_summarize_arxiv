    "the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies is one of the main pillars of the big bang model . with the latest results from wmap satellite @xcite , and the information provided by ground - based experiments such as vsa @xcite , acbar @xcite or cbi @xcite",
    ", it has been possible to determine cosmological parameters with accuracies better than 5% ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the cmb contains far more information encoded in its polarization signal . since the first detection of polarization by the dasi experiment@xcite , other experiments have started to measure the angular power spectrum of the polarization .",
    "although those measurements are still having a relatively poor signal - to - noise , they show excellent agreement with the predictions of the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the standard theory predicts that the cmb is linearly polarized , the physical mechanism responsible for its polarization being thomson scattering during the recombination or reionization epochs . generally speaking",
    ", the polarization tensor can be decomposed in terms of a e - field ( gradient ) and a b - field ( rotational ) components @xcite . due to parity conservation",
    ", this implies that we have three angular power spectra to describe the polarization field : the te ( cross - correlation of temperature and e mode ) , the ee and bb power spectra .",
    "all the other combinations ( tb and eb ) should be zero .",
    "if the fluctuations in cmb intensity are seeded by scalar perturbations ( i.e fluctuations in the density alone ) , one would only expect primordial e modes in the cmb polarization",
    ". however , vector and tensor perturbations , like those due to gravitational waves in the primordial universe ( e.g. @xcite ) , are mechanisms that could generate primordial b - modes in the polarization on large angular scales .",
    "therefore if we can measure these modes we may have a unique way to carry out a detailed study of the inflationary epoch .",
    "in particular , the energy scale @xmath2 at which inflation occurred can be expressed in terms of @xmath3 , the ratio of tensor to scalar contributions to the power spectrum , as @xcite @xmath4 the current upper limit of @xmath5 from wmap data @xcite translates into @xmath6  gev .",
    "because of the importance of detecting primordial gravitational waves @xcite , there is a huge interest to develop ground - based experiments to measure ( or constrain ) the amplitude of b - modes power spectrum of the cmb polarization .",
    "here we present one of these efforts .",
    "the quijote ( q - u - i joint tenerife ) cmb experiment is a scientific collaboration between the instituto de astrofsica de canarias , the instituto de fsica de cantabria , the idom company , and the universities of cantabria , manchester and cambridge , with the aim of characterizing the polarization of the cmb , and other galactic and extragalactic physical processes in the frequency range 10 - 30  ghz and at angular scales larger than 1 degree .",

    ", height=207 ]",
    "the quijote - cmb experiment has two primary scientific goals :    * to detect the imprint of gravitational b - modes if they have an amplitude @xmath8 ; * to provide essential information of the polarization of the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions from our galaxy at low frequencies ( 10 - 20  ghz ) .    in order to achieve these scientific objectives ,",
    "we need to cover a total sky area of the order of 3,000 - 10,000 square degrees , and to reach sensitivities of @xmath9  @xmath10k per one degree beam after one year of operation with the low frequency instrument ( 11 - 19  ghz ) , and @xmath11  @xmath10k per beam with the second instrument at 30  ghz .",
    "although the final observing strategy is still under discussion , a possible solution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : goal ] , where we show the scientific goal for the angular power spectrum of the e and b modes after 3 years of operation , assuming a sky coverage of 5,000 square degrees . in this particular case ,",
    "the final noise figure for the 30  ghz map is @xmath12  @xmath10k / beam . according to those nominal sensitivities",
    ", quijote will provide one of the most sensitive 11 - 19  ghz measurements of the polarization of the synchrotron and anomalous emissions on degree angular scales .",
    "this information is extremely important given that b - modes are known to be sub - dominant in amplitude as compared to the galactic emission ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : foregrounds ] , where we present the amplitude of the expected synchrotron and radio - source contribution at 30  ghz , computed according to the models described in @xcite .",
    "the quijote low frequency maps will complement the measurements of the planck satellite , helping in the characterization of the galactic emission .",
    "in particular , quijote will provide a key contribution to assess the level of a possible contribution of polarized microwave anomalous emission @xcite .",
    "using the low frequency maps , we plan to correct the high frequency quijote channel ( 30  ghz ) to search for primordial b - modes . to illustrate this , fig .",
    "[ fig : foregrounds ] shows the residual synchrotron contribution after a pixel - by - pixel correction of the high frequency map assuming a pure power - law behavior for the synchrotron emission law .",
    "the issue of radio - sources is discussed below , in the context of the source subtraction facility .",
    "quijote - cmb will observe at five frequencies , namely 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 and 30  ghz , with an angular resolution of @xmath13  degree .",
    "it will operate from the observatorio del teide ( 2400  m ) in tenerife ( spain ) , which has been shown to be an excellent place for cmb observations ( same site as tenerife , cosmosomas , vsa and jbo - iac interferometer experiments ) .",
    "the project has two phases .",
    "_ phase i _ , which is completely funded , consists in the construction of a first telescope and two instruments which can be exchanged in the focal plane .",
    "the first instrument will be a multichannel instrument providing the frequency coverage between 11 and 19  ghz , plus a single pixel at 30  ghz , and it is expected to start observations at the beginning of 2009 .",
    "the second instrument will consist of 19 polarimeters working at 30  ghz , and it is expected to start operations at the end of 2009 .",
    "table  [ tab : basic ] summarizes the basic parameters describing these two instruments . ] .",
    "the temperature sensitivity per beam is computed as @xmath14 being @xmath15 the number of channels , @xmath16 the bandwidth and @xmath17 the system temperature ( i.e. including the sky ) .",
    "_ phase i _ also includes a source subtractor facility to monitor and correct the contribution of polarized radio - sources in the final maps .",
    "the overall time baseline for the project is to achieve the main science goal ( @xmath7 ) by end of 2011 , and @xmath0 by 2015 .",
    "finally , _ phase ii _",
    "( which is still not funded ) considers the construction of a second telescope identical to the first one , and a third instrument with 30 polarimeters at 40  ghz .",

    "in addition , a cylindrical absorbing screen surrounding the optics ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tel ] ) minimizes the spillover signal .",
    "both mirrors have been designed to operate up to 90  ghz i.e. rms @xmath20  @xmath10 m and maximum deviation of @xmath21  @xmath10 m .",
    "the whole system is mounted on a platform that can rotate around the vertical axis at a frequency of 0.25  hz .",
    "the supporting structure has been designed using an alto - azimuthal concept which enables the telescope to point to any position in the sky with elevation above the horizon higher than @xmath22 .",
    "this is a multi - channel instrument with five separate polarimeters ( providing 5 independent sky pixels ) : two which operate at 10 - 14  ghz , two which operate at 16 - 20  ghz , and a central polarimeter at 30  ghz .",
    "the science driver for this first instrument is the characterization of the galactic emission .",
    "the optical arrangement includes 5 conical corrugated feedhorns ( designed by the university of manchester ) staring into a dual reflector crossed - dragonian system , which provides optimal cross - polarization properties ( designed to be @xmath23  db ) and symmetric beams .",
    "each horn feeds a novel cryogenic on - axis rotating polar modulator which can rotate at speeds of up to 40  hz ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : first ] ) .",
    "this rotational rate is fast enough to switch out 1/f noise in the lower frequency lnas ( since polar modulation occurs at four times the rotational rate , i.e. @xmath24  hz ) .",
    "the 30  ghz front - end module ( fem ) has additional phase switching to provide stability .",
    "the orthogonal linear polar signals are separated through a wide - band cryogenic ortho - mode - transducer ( omt ) before being amplified through two similar lnas ( a faraday type module in the case of 30  ghz ) .",
    "these two orthogonal signals are fed into a room - temperature back - end module ( bem ) where they are further amplified and spectrally filtered before being detected by square - law detectors .",
    "all the polarimeters except the 30  ghz receiver have simultaneous `` q '' and `` u '' detection i.e. the 2 orthogonal linear polar signals are also correlated through a @xmath25 hybrid and passed through two additional detectors .",
    "the band passes of these lower frequency polarimeters have also been split into an upper and lower band which gives a total of 8 channels per polarimeter ( see table  [ tab : basic ] ) .",
    "the fem for the low frequency channels is being built by iac .",
    "the receivers for these channels use mmic 6 - 20  ghz lnas ( designed by s. weinreb and built in caltech ) .",
    "the gain for these amplifiers is approximately 30  db , and the noise temperature is less than 9  k across the band .",
    "the 30  ghz fem is being built at the university of manchester , and the design uses an existing faraday module ( same as the one used for ocra - f ) .",
    "the bem for the 30  ghz instrument is being built by dicom , with collaboration of ifca at the simulation level .",
    "the cryogenics and the mechanical systems are provided by cms ( jeff julian ) , idom and iac .",
    "this instrument will be devoted to primordial b - modes science .",
    "it will consist in 19 polarimeters operating at 30  ghz .",
    "the conceptual design is a re - scaled version of the first instrument .",
    "an upgraded version of the vsa source subtractor ( vsa - ss ) facility @xcite , which is being carried out by the cavendish laboratory and the university of manchester , will be used to monitor the contribution of radio - sources in the quijote maps .",
    "the vsa - ss is a two element interferometer , operating at 30  ghz , with @xmath26  m dishes and a separation of 9  m ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vsa - ss ] ) . we have estimated that at 30  ghz it is enough to correct the emission of all sources with fluxes in total intensity higher than 300  mjy in order to make the residual source contribution equal or smaller than the expected b - mode signal for the case of @xmath7 ( see fig .",
