    "the observed @xmath12 bond energies of double-@xmath7 hypernuclei are currently the only reliable source of information on the @xmath12 interaction . in this regard ,",
    "we stress the importance of the observation of the double-@xmath7 hypernucleus @xmath13he ( nagara event ) in the kek - e373 experiment @xcite .",
    "further analysis of this experiment is still in progress .    regarding the  interaction ,",
    "the few current experimental data indicate that the @xmath8-nucleus interactions are attractive .",
    "one example is the observed spectrum of the @xmath14 reaction on a @xmath15c target to produce , where the cross section for @xmath2 production in the threshold region was interpreted by assuming a @xmath2-nucleus woods - saxon ( ws ) potential with a depth of about 14  mev @xcite . using this assumption , a cluster model calculation predicted values of about 5  mev for the ground - state  binding ( removal ) energy @xmath16 with coulomb interaction for  and 2.2  mev without @xcite , while an amd approach @xcite yielded slightly lower values of about 35.5  mev , using the same  interactions .",
    "other observed data on the @xmath8 hypernucleus  ( @xmath17 ) were obtained by emulsion data @xcite .",
    "the reported @xmath2 binding energies are @xmath18  mev , @xmath19  mev , and @xmath20  mev , where the second value was expected to be consistent with a decay from this system in the @xmath21 state",
    ". however , there is also the possibility that the observed event was a decay from an atomic @xmath22 state .",
    "therefore , it is hard to confirm that this event was an observation of a strongly bound @xmath8 hypernucleus .    in 2015 , analysis of the kek - e373 experiment provided the first clear evidence of the bound @xmath2 hypernucleus  @xcite , produced in the reaction @xmath23",
    "@xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "this data is called `` kiso '' event .",
    "two possible  binding energies are interpreted experimentally : ( 1 ) one is @xmath26()@xmath27 , which was deduced under the assumption that both hypernuclei  and involved in the reaction were produced in their ground states . in this case , the hypernucleus  is considered to be in the state .",
    "( 2 ) another possible binding energy is @xmath28 , if  was left in an excited state .",
    "recently jlab reported the energy spectra of  using the @xmath29 reaction  @xcite . when the energy of the excited state in  is taken into account , the @xmath2 binding energy is interpreted around 1.11  mev , and",
    "the observed  in the kiso event is in the state  @xcite .",
    "the kiso event is important in the sense that it confirms that the  interaction is attractive .",
    "now we have the following questions : ( i ) can we identify the state of the kiso event theoretically , that is , the event is  or ?",
    "( ii ) how much attraction do we need to reproduce the observed @xmath2 binding energies of the event ?",
    "( iii ) can we reproduce the old  data in ref .",
    "@xcite using the same  interaction to reproduce the kiso event ?    to answer these questions",
    ", we adopt the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) and skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) models to study the kiso event by employing effective interactions , which will be fitted to reproduce the experimental  binding energy of , and with those interactions we investigate whether a consistent theoretical description for  and  is possible or not .",
    "the mean - field theory is a powerful theoretical approach , which can be globally applied from light to heavy ( hyper)nuclei @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this approach has also been employed successfully for @xmath7 hypernuclei with @xmath30 , which are relatively light systems @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we study @xmath8 hypernuclei with @xmath31 and 15 and focus on the states @xmath32b  ( g.s.)@xmath33 for  and @xmath0n  ( g.s.)@xmath34 for , and their hyperon separation energy , b_y = e([n , p , y ] ) - e([n , p,- ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the core nuclei of @xmath32b and @xmath0n are compact shell structures and then it is not expect to have any dynamical contraction of the core by addition of a hyperon .",
    "this phenomena was already pointed out in ref .",
    "thus , for this observable one can expect that a major part of an inaccurate description of the common nuclear core @xmath35 $ ] cancels out , as well as that other uncertainties such as center - of - mass , pairing , deformation corrections etc .",
    ", become much less relevant .",
    "the removal energy then depends predominantly on the phenomenological @xmath5 interaction parameters that we adjust to the data , i.e. , the hyperon - nucleus mean field .",
    "therefore it is expected that we can safely interpret the state of the kiso event theoretically .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath2 hypernuclei decay into double-@xmath7 hypernuclei by the @xmath12 coupling .",
    "therefore , the  interaction should have an imaginary part to represent the decay width .",

    "( d ) , the mean fields sl0@xmath169 and rmf@xmath169 are much deeper than the ws parametrization , remedying their narrow widths , and finally provide much larger @xmath2 removal energies . it can be seen that the mean field sl0@xmath169 has about the same depth , but is wider than the one of rmf@xmath169 , which leads to an about 2  mev larger @xmath2 binding energy listed in table  [ t : bec ] .    comparing with the `` empirical value '' of , the interactions rmf and sl3 are capable to simultaneously reproduce the data of  and .",
    "therefore we support the claim that the `` kiso event '' could be an observation of the excited state in , i.e. , , which is consistent with one of the experimental interpretations . with the compatible  interactions , we then predict that the @xmath134 of the ground state of @xmath170c should be 8.09.4  mev with rmf and 7.2  mev using sl3 with shf .",
    "this range is not small due to the fact that the @xmath91-state @xmath8 probes mainly fairly low nuclear densities , such that the behavior of the @xmath8 mean field remains largely unconstrained at normal nuclear density , relevant for the @xmath89 state .",
    "furthermore , we have in this work only adjusted the isoscalar  interactions , and disregarded fitting also the isospin dependence of the interaction .",
    "this situation can only improve with the availability of more unambiguous and precise data .",
    "motivated by the recent observation of the @xmath171 kiso event , which provides the first clear evidence for a strongly bound @xmath2 hypernuclear state , we have studied the structure of that @xmath2 hypernucleus and the  interaction within the framework of the rmf and shf models .",
    "the  interactions are constructed by reproducing the experimental data . for the kiso event , we have two interpretations for the @xmath8 binding energy @xmath134 , @xmath172  mev or @xmath173  mev , which could correspond to the ground state and excited state of  with the @xmath2 hyperon in the @xmath174 and @xmath161 orbits , respectively .    first , assuming  to be the ground state , and adjusting the  interaction",
    "so as to reproduce @xmath151  mev , the calculated @xmath134 of  is 1.72.7  mev with coulomb interaction , which is excluded due to the much smaller values of @xmath134 than the empirical data @xmath175  mev , unless the ws mean field is about 23  mev less than 14  mev for that nucleus , or the lane potential is unusually attractive for  @xcite .",
    "next , assuming  to be the excited state , we tune the  interaction to yield @xmath154  mev for , the obtained  becomes much more bound with respect to the @xmath32b@xmath1 threshold . with coulomb interaction",
    ", it is 6.16.2  mev by the rmf and 5.2  mev by the sl3 of shf , which appear consistent with the empirical data @xmath153  mev .",
    "combining the above two cases , the preferred interpretation of the kiso event is an observation of the excited state in , i.e. ,  by the approaches of rmf and shf , which is consistent with the experimental analysis .",
    "then the predicted @xmath8 removal energy of  in the ground state is 7.29.4  mev .",
    "currently , it is planned to perform an emulsion experiment to search for double - strangeness hypernuclei at j - parc this year .",
    "our prediction should be confronted with the future data , which will also serve to constrain better the rmf and shf  interaction parameters .",
