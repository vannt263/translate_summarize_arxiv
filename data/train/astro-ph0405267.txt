    "the simplest possibility is that dark energy merely is a ( tiny ) cosmological constant .",

    "i explore whether dark energy can be vector - like .",
    "vector - like dark energy turns out to display a series of properties that make it particularly interesting phenomenologically .",
    "on one side , it can also violate the dominant energy condition , @xmath4 , while possessing a conventional kinetic term .",
    "on the other side , it has non - anisotropic stress perturbations and it leads to violations of the decomposition theorem @xcite , i.e. the decoupling of scalar , vector and tensor cosmological perturbations . as we shall see , other interesting features include the existence of tracking attractors , that render the evolution of a vector field in an expanding universe rather insensitive to initial conditions . in spite of this attractive feature ,",
    "the onset of cosmic acceleration is determined by a parameter in the lagrangian that has to be properly adjusted , as in most other models . in that respect , these forms of vector dark energy are similar to quintessence trackers @xcite .",
    "non - gravitational interactions are known to be mediated by vector fields .",
    "in addition , from a four - dimensional point of view , certain components of higher - dimensional metrics behave like vectors @xcite .",
    "it is hence natural to study the evolution of vector fields in a cosmological setting .",
    "however , the existence of a spatially non - vanishing vector breaks the isotropy of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . from the point of view of gravity ,",
    "such a breaking manifests itself in anisotropic stresses caused by the vector .",
    "if dark energy is such a vector , as long as it remains subdominant , this violation is likely to be observationally irrelevant @xcite . once dark energy comes to dominate though",
    ", one would expect an anisotropic expansion of the universe , in conflict with the significant isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "because of that , in this paper i consider a `` cosmic triad '' , i.e. a set of three equal length vectors that point in three mutually orthogonal spatial directions .",
    "remarkably , the existence of a triad turns to be compatible with spatial isotropy , at least from the point of view of gravity .",
    "while the triad guarantees the isotropy of the background , it does not automatically imply the isotropy of its perturbations .",
    "eventually , it might be even necessary to introduce fields that explicitly violate rotational symmetry , as there appear to be hints of ( statistical ) anisotropy in the cmb fluctuations @xcite .",
    "along these lines , i speculate below that a triad could provide a link between cosmic acceleration and some of the anomalies observed in the cmb radiation @xcite .",
    "mainly because they single out spatial directions , vector fields have received comparatively little attention in cosmology .",
    "ford has proposed an inflationary model where a vector is responsible for a stage of inflation @xcite .",

    "i use the einstein summation convention throughout , where a sum is implied _ only _ over indices in opposite positions .",
    "the indices that label the different vectors are raised and lowered with the flat `` metric '' @xmath13 .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath14 in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) is not unique in the following sense . up to boundary terms",
    ", @xmath15 is the only additional diffeomorphism invariant quadratic term that contains two derivatives of the vector @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "additional couplings of the vector are constrained by tests of gravity @xcite and limits on possible violations of lorentz symmetry @xcite . to avoid such violations , i assume that the matter lagrangian @xmath17 only depends on the metric @xmath18 and on the remaining matter fields @xmath19 , but not on the cosmic triad @xmath20 . in that respect ,",
    "the triad is analogous to conventional quintessence @xcite .",
    "varying the action ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to the metric one obtains the einstein equations @xmath21 , where the energy momentum tensor of the triad is given by @xmath22.\\ ] ] this energy momentum tensor is the sum of the three different energy momentum tensors of the decoupled vectors , @xmath23 , neither of which is of perfect - fluid form . by varying the action with respect to the vectors @xmath5 , one obtains their equations of motion , @xmath24 the four - divergence of the last equation yields a constrain equation for the vector . as a consequence ,",
    "each vector has three dynamical degrees of freedom , as it should .",

    "note that the @xmath30-component of equation ( [ eq : fullmotion ] ) forces @xmath31 to vanish , as in the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) . substituting the metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) into the einstein equations one obtains    [ eq : einstein ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the hubble `` constant '' .",
    "the energy density of the universe is @xmath34 and its pressure is defined by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 run over the spatial spacetime components .",

    "for the frw metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) , @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 should also vanish .",
    "it can be easily verified that this is indeed the case for the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "the requirement of isotropy is non - trivial for a single vector , since its energy momentum tensor is @xmath40 although this energy momentum tensor is diagonal , its value along the @xmath41 direction is different from the one along the directions perpendicular to it .",
    "nevertheless , the total energy momentum tensor @xmath42 has isotropic stresses , and the corresponding energy density @xmath43 and ( isotropic ) pressure @xmath44 are given by    [ eq : pandrho ] @xmath45    note that the equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) can be also derived from the condition @xmath46 .    to conclude this section",
    "let me point out a remarkable property of the cosmic triad .",
    "namely , its equation of state @xmath47 can become less than @xmath48 ( with a positive energy density ) if @xmath49 is negative @xcite .",
    "because a mass term for a vector @xmath16 has the form @xmath50 , i call such vectors `` tachyonic '' . tachyons ( particles of negative squared mass ) are usually associated with instabilities . in many cases , an instability merely signals the tendency of the system to evolve . in cosmology ,",
    "those instabilities are not particularly terrible .",
    "in fact , a universe in stable equilibrium would be pretty lame , as it would not even expand . in the absence of gravitational instability structures would not form , and without the ( effective ) tachyonic mass of a scalar , it would be quite difficult to seed a scale invariant spectrum of perturbations during inflation @xcite .",
    "scalar tachyons with a convex potential , @xmath51 . ]",
    "indeed have been widely considered in the literature .",
    "other forms of instability are more worrisome , like the quantum - mechanical instability of the vacuum in the presence of a phantom @xcite . by simple analogy , any form of instability associated with a tachyonic vector is not expected to be of this second kind , as the vectors have a conventional kinetic term .",
    "this question is not only of academic interest , since analyses of observational data ( marginally ) favor a dark energy equation of state @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "i shall not deal here with the quantum mechanics of tachyonic particles , which even for scalars is not free of problems .",
    "nevertheless , i also want to present some arguments that suggest that a tachyonic vector might be similar to a phantom field @xcite .",
    "one of the arguments goes back to the stueckelberg theory of massive vectors @xcite .",
    "consider for simplicity a vector field in minkowski space , @xmath52 the field is massive for @xmath53 and tachyonic for @xmath54 . upon the substitution @xmath55",
    ", the lagrangian ( [ eq : massive ] ) reads @xmath56 note that ( [ eq : stueckelberg ] ) contains an additional scalar , the stueckelberg field @xmath57 . for a massive vector ( @xmath53 )",
    "@xmath57 has a conventional kinetic term , but for a tachyonic vector ( @xmath54 ) , its kinetic term has the `` wrong '' sign , like the one of a phantom @xcite .",
    "however , the additional field @xmath57 turns to be constrained in the quantum theory .",
    "even though it describes a massive vector , the lagrangian ( [ eq : stueckelberg ] ) has a gauge symmetry , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a scalar function .",
    "upon quantization , this gauge freedom is fixed by imposing the stueckelberg subsidiary condition @xmath61 , which relates @xmath57 and the divergence of the vector @xcite .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the field @xmath57 is not simply a phantom scalar in the conventional sense . on the other hand ,",
    "there are other properties that suggest phantom - like behavior of a tachyonic vector , like the opposite sign of the propagator in the high - momentum limit , or the opposite sign in front of the squared longitudinal momentum in the hamiltonian @xcite .    in the time - dependent situation we are dealing with , where the triad vectors have a non - vanishing expectation value , the issue is slightly more complicated .",
    "consider quantum fluctuations @xmath62 around one of the triad vectors in our classical solutions , @xmath63 .",
    "expanding the vector lagrangian in ( [ eq : action ] ) to second order in @xmath62 and neglecting fluctuations in the gravitational field i get , for one of the triad vectors , @xmath64 terms linear in the perturbations vanish if @xmath65 satisfies the classical equations of motion .",
    "note that in addition to the mass term proportional to @xmath49 , there is an additional contribution proportional to @xmath66 that breaks lorentz invariance ( because of the coupling of @xmath67 to the classical , non - vanishing vector @xmath68 . )",
    "therefore , the quantization of @xmath67 is expected to be significantly different from the one of the tachyonic vector in the lagrangian ( [ eq : massive ] ) .",
    "our next task consists in studying the evolution of the cosmic triad in a universe that contains additional forms of `` matter '' , like an inflaton ( @xmath69 ) , radiation ( @xmath70 ) or dust ( @xmath71 ) . ideally , we would like the cosmic triad to remain subdominant during most of cosmic history , and just around redshift @xmath72 come to dominate the energy density of the universe and trigger a stage of accelerated expansion .    the vector equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] )",
    "is formally the same as the one for a self - interacting _ conformally coupled _ scalar field .",
    "indeed , the term in parenthesis is proportional to the ricci scalar @xmath73 , which vanishes during radiation domination . of course",
    ", the similarity between the equations of motion of a vector and a conformally coupled scalar arises from the conformal invariance of the maxwell lagrangian . in some instances it is going to be more convenient to deal with a set of two first order differential equations , rather that with a single second order one . introducing the number of @xmath74-folds @xmath75 as a time variable , and defining @xmath76 the vector equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) can be recast as    [ eq : xandy ] @xmath77    where the hubble constant is given by equation ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) .    in the following",
    "i study the vector equations of motion in two limits : the limit where matter dominates ( early stages of cosmic evolution ) and the limit of triad domination ( late stages ) .",
    "the evolution of the triad depends on the self interaction @xmath78 . in this paper",
    "i focus on a class of run - away power - law potentials @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a positive parameter with dimensions of mass .",
    "this class turns to be sufficiently general for our purposes . in five spacetime dimensions , a self - interaction of this form ( with @xmath81 )",
    "leads to inflation along `` our '' three spatial dimensions , while keeping the size of the remaining fifth dimension essentially constant @xcite .",
    "these runaway potentials are also reminiscent of a class of `` tracker '' quintessence @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath82 , the case we are interested in , all these models are tachyonic .",
    "non - tachyonic interactions do not appear to be particularly interesting .",
    "suppose that the energy density of the universe is dominated by the inflaton , radiation or dust , i.e. the contribution of the triad to the total energy density of the universe is negligible .",
    "the scale factor then grows like @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the matter equation of state .",
    "thus , @xmath85 during nearly de sitter inflation , @xmath86 during radiation domination and @xmath87 during dust domination .",
    "we shall keep @xmath88 as a free parameter and consider solutions of the equation of motion where @xmath89 also grows as a power in cosmic time .",
    "the reader can verify that indeed , @xmath90 is a solution of the equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) for an interaction given by equation ( [ eq : v ] ) . actually , this solution is also an attractor . perturbing @xmath91 and linearizing equation ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) for the given unperturbed background ( [ eq : a ] ) i find @xmath92 the term in parenthesis is positive during dust domination , and it vanishes during radiation domination . at the same time , the derivative @xmath93 is always positive for the potentials ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "therefore , small deviations from the solution ( [ eq : mattersolution ] ) oscillate and decay away . note that along the attractor , the equation of state of the triad is constant , @xmath94 hence , these solutions are analogous to the quintessence and trackers discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the triad equation of state is always smaller than the one of the dominant component , and the closer the latter to @xmath48 , the lesser is their difference .",
    "the triad equation of state as a function of @xmath95 is plotted for various values of @xmath88 in figure [ fig : wattractor ] .",
    "because at the present epoch the universe is not dominated by dust any more , the value of the triad equation of state today lies between the ones along the matter attractor and the de sitter attractor i will discuss next .",
    "hence , experimental constraints @xcite on the value of @xmath0 restrict the possible values of @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , in order to obtain @xmath96 today , models with @xmath97 have to be considered .",
    "this restriction applies provided initial conditions are chosen in the basin of attraction of the tracking solution .    ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : wattractor ] ) , for ( from top to bottom ) @xmath86 ( radiation domination ) , @xmath87 ( dust domination ) and @xmath98 ( nearly de sitter inflation ) .",
    "[ fig : wattractor ] ]    for later purposes , let me also discuss an approximate solution of the system ( [ eq : xandy ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "loosely speaking , these inequalities are attained in the limits of large @xmath89 or large @xmath101 .",
    "then , equations ( [ eq : xandy ] ) have the approximate solution @xmath102 , \\quad b = b_{(0 ) } \\exp[-2(n - n_0)]\\ ] ] along this solution the kinetic energy of the field @xmath103 decreases , whereas the potential energy @xmath104 increases .",
    "hence , soon the potential energy dominates the kinetic one , @xmath105 , so that along this approximate solution the equation of state is @xmath106 which is less than @xmath48 .",
    "however , this approximate solution only holds temporarily , as the assumptions we have made finally become violated .",
    "later on i will discuss an example where initial conditions place the triad on the approximate solution ( [ eq : approximate ] ) for a significant period of time .",
    "note that in the opposite limit , the limit where the kinetic energy dominates the potential one , @xmath107 , the triad equation of state is radiation - like , @xmath108 . in both limits ,",
    "the triad is quite different from a ( canonical ) scalar field ( with positive potential ) , for which @xmath109 .      along the attractor ( [ eq : mattersolution ] ) , the energy density of the triad decays slower than the one of matter .",
    "therefore , sooner or later the triad will come to dominate the universe .",
    "consider thus the equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) when the triad dominates the content of the universe .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) and ( [ eq : pandrho ] ) the vector equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) takes the form @xmath110 which is just like the equation of motion of a minimally coupled scalar with appropriate potential ( we wo nt need the explicit form of @xmath111 ) .",
    "solutions of equation ( [ eq : dominantx ] ) with constant @xmath112 can be easily identified by requiring @xmath113 to have a zero at @xmath114 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath115 those constant @xmath89 solutions are expected to be stable ( attractors ) if @xmath116 , which implies @xmath117 along the attractor the energy density is , from equations ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) and ( [ eq : rho ] ) , @xmath118 i.e. a constant . hence , these constant @xmath89 solutions are de sitter attractors with @xmath119 ; they are natural candidates to accommodate the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows a phase diagram of the system ( [ eq : dominantx ] ) when the triad is the dominant component of the universe . note that along the de sitter attractor",
    ", the kinetic energy of the triad does not vanish .    ) for @xmath81 .",
    "the units are arbitrary .",
    "the diagram clearly shows that all phase trajectories converge to the single de sitter attractor at constant @xmath89 and @xmath101 .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ]    inserting the potentials ( [ eq : v ] ) into equation ( [ eq : dsa ] ) and verifying condition ( [ eq : stability ] ) i find that there is a single ( stable ) de sitter attractor at @xmath120 substituting this value of @xmath114 into ( [ eq : density ] ) and requiring it to be of the order of the present energy density , one can then estimate what is the required value of @xmath80 to fit the present stage of accelerated expansion , @xmath121 therefore , for @xmath122 the required value leads to the `` infamous '' scale @xmath123 ev , whereas larger values of @xmath95 result into more reasonable energies .",
    "note that we are fitting , rather that explaining , the time cosmic acceleration begins . as mentioned above",
    ", the exponent @xmath95 determines the value of the equation of state today .",
    "the close @xmath95 to @xmath30 , the closer @xmath124 is to @xmath48 today .      in this section",
    "i present two particular examples of possible realizations of vector dark energy .",
    "current limits on the value of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath0 and its derivative with respect to redshift @xmath125 at @xmath126 are @xmath127 where the prior on the density parameter of dust @xmath128 has been assumed @xcite . because the uncertainties are correlated , the reader is advised to look at the constraints on the @xmath129 plane in figure 10 of @xcite .",
    "note that the limits ( [ eq : limits ] ) are significantly weaker than the ones derived assuming that @xmath0 is constant .",

    "the scalar equation is @xmath167 where @xmath168 is implicitly defined by the decomposition @xmath169 into a scalar @xmath168 and a transverse vector @xmath170 .",
    "the perturbation of @xmath132 is given by @xmath171,\\ ] ] and in particular , does not contain @xmath172 .",
    "the remaining vector equation takes the form @xmath173 therefore , again , scalar , vector and tensor perturbations are not decoupled , since there exists a non - vanishing vector in the background .    note",
    "that ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is not a dynamical equation for @xmath174 , but a constraint .",
    "it seems that for tachyonic models , @xmath175 , one can not solve for @xmath174 , since in that case the operator @xmath176 is not invertible .",
    "this would point out to a potential inconsistency of tachyonic models .",
    "however , as we shall see next , this difficulty is only apparent . taking the laplacian of equation ( [ eq : scalarequation ] ) and using the time derivative of the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) to substitute the value of @xmath177 ,",
    "one obtains a first order differential equation in time for @xmath174 that does not contain its spatial derivatives , @xmath178\\delta a_0=",
    "f(\\phi,\\psi,\\chi , a,\\vec{a},\\vec{b}).\\ ] ] here , @xmath179 is a function of the specified variables and its derivatives we shall not be concerned with .",
    "what is important is that if a set of initial conditions satisfying the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) is specified , then , the solution of equations ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) and ( [ eq : scalarequation ] ) is guaranteed to satisfy equation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) at all times .",
    "hence , it is in fact possible to solve for @xmath174 .    to conclude this part",
    "let us count how many `` degrees of freedom '' ( per vector ) the triad perturbations contain .",
    "we have seen that @xmath172 is constrained , so it is not dynamical .",
    "equation ( [ eq : scalarequation ] ) contains the second time derivative of @xmath180 ( 1 dof ) and equation ( [ eq : vectorequation ] ) the second time derivative of the transverse vector @xmath181 ( 2 dof ) .",
    "thus , there are @xmath182 degrees in freedom in total , as pertains to a massive vector .",
    "the perturbations in the triad induce perturbations in its energy momentum tensor , which in turn are responsible for sourcing metric perturbations . in this subsection",
    "i shall deal with vector and tensor perturbations , which can not be sourced in conventional cosmological models .",
    "the perturbations in the energy - momentum tensor of the triad vectors @xmath5 can be decomposed into an isotropic pressure @xmath183 and a traceless anisotropic stress @xmath184 perturbation , @xmath185 .",
    "the anisotropic stress itself can be decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor components , @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , @xmath188 ( @xmath189 transverse ) , and @xmath190 is transverse and traceless .",
    "the equations of motion for vector ( metric ) perturbations are @xcite @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the vector part of the triad anisotropic stress tensor . in the absence of anisotropic stress sources ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : vectormetric ] ) implies that vector perturbations decay away , @xmath193 .",
    "so even if they are generated in the early stages of the universe , they are not expected to be significant today .",
    "the transverse and traceless anisotropic stress sources tensor perturbations , i.e. gravitational waves , @xmath194 as opposed to vector perturbations , in the absence of sources the amplitude of long - wavelength gravitational waves remains constant .",
    "hence , if they are primordially produced , say during an inflationary stage , they could still have a sizable amplitude today .",
    "i shall not write down all the terms that the perturbed spatial components of the energy momentum tensor of a single triad vector contains .",
    "they straightforwardly ( but tediously ) follow from the insertion of the perturbations ( [ eq : perturbedmetric ] ) and ( [ eq : decompose ] ) into equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) . instead , for the sake of illustration i shall consider only @xmath195= 2 a^{-2 } \\frac{dv}{da^2 }    \\left(a^i \\delta",
    "a_j+\\delta a^i a_j\\right)+\\cdots,\\ ] ] where the dots denote the multiple terms i am not explicitly writing down . in order to study the evolution of vector and tensor perturbations we have to compute the vector and tensor components of the previous expression . in fourier space ,",
    "these are given by @xcite @xmath196 @xmath197,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which as required are transverse and traceless .",
    "note that we sum over the three triad vectors to obtain the total energy momentum tensor perturbation .",
    "because the triad perturbations @xmath198 are a priori totally independent from each other , the anisotropic stress @xmath190 does not vanish in general .",
    "thus , vector fields are not only expected to source vector perturbations , but also tensor perturbations .",
    "again , the reason is that the decomposition theorem is violated . with the aid of the background vectors it is possible",
    "do construct traceless and transverse quantities linear in the perturbations .",
    "if the perturbations have certain symmetries , @xmath190 does indeed vanish ( for the particular term in the energy momentum tensor we are considering ) . because @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the only vectors in the problem , the triad perturbation @xmath198 is expected to be a function of @xmath199 and @xmath200 . since @xmath201 is transverse , it has to be of the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath88 are two scalar functions and @xmath204 is totally antisymmetric . assume that @xmath203 and @xmath88 do not depend on the index @xmath162 ( that is , they do not depend on @xmath205 . )",
    "then , substituting equation ( [ eq : transverse ] ) in ( [ eq : tt ] ) and using ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) one finds not only that @xmath206 , but also @xmath207 .",
    "the main worry one faces when dealing with tachyonic fields is their stability . in order to figure out to what extent the solutions we have found in section [ sec : evolution ] are stable",
    ", we should solve the system of cosmological perturbation equations just presented .",
    "obviously , the coupling between scalar , vector and tensor perturbations makes this task quite formidable . in this section",
    "we dramatically simplify the equations by neglecting metric perturbations and concentrating on a particular set of vector modes .",
    "the hope is that this drastic simplification captures the qualitative features of the equations .",
    "so let s set @xmath208 and consider the triad perturbation equations in fourier space . from equation ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) , for modes",
    "for which @xmath209 , it follows that @xmath210 .",
    "then , @xmath211 is a solution of equations ( [ eq : constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : scalarequation ] ) . because @xmath212 , if in addition we consider perturbations such that @xmath213 , the remaining vector equation ( [ eq : vectorequation ] ) reads @xmath214 where for convenience i have gone back to cosmic time .",
    "note how @xmath215 plays the role of a mass term in the last equation .",
    "this is why i call interactions with @xmath175 `` tachyonic '' .",
    "generically , if @xmath49 is negative , one expects growing modes , that is , instabilities .    in order to check the stability of the triad , it suffices to consider long - wavelength modes , @xmath216 , in equation ( [ eq : stabilityequation ] ) . for sufficiently high @xmath217 ,",
    "the gradient dominates the interaction and solutions are stable .",
    "hence , any form of instability is an `` infrared '' effect , rather than an ultraviolet one . for a given expansion , equation ( [ eq : a ] ) , along the attractor ( [ eq : mattersolution ] )",
    ", the long - wavelength solution of equation ( [ eq : stabilityequation ] ) is @xmath218 here , @xmath219 and @xmath220 are two integration constants and for convenience i have divided by the scale factor to obtain the length of the perturbation .",
    "we should compare these solutions with the behavior of the background , equation ( [ eq : mattersolution ] ) .",
    "recall than @xmath89 is the common length of the background triad vectors .",
    "the @xmath219 mode in equation ( [ eq : perturbationsolution ] ) grows as fast as @xmath89 and the @xmath220 mode grows less rapidly than @xmath89 if @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath220 mode decays relative to @xmath89 during inflation , radiation and dust domination .",
    "hence , within the scope of our analysis , the system is not unstable throughout the period where the triad is subdominant .",
    "note however that the triad would be unstable for certain values of @xmath95 if there had been a period of cosmic history during which @xmath222 .",
    "when the triad becomes dominant , the vector evolves towards the de sitter attractor ( [ eq : ds ] ) .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq : stabilityequation ] ) along the de sitter attractor is @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the value of the hubble constant along the de sitter solution .",
    "note that along the latter @xmath89 itself is constant .",
    "thus , the de sitter attractor is unstable , in the sense that @xmath225 ( the length of the vector perturbation ) grows relative to @xmath89 ( the length of the background vector ) .",
    "because during the previous stages of cosmic history ( when the triad was subdominant ) the relative amplitude of the perturbations @xmath226 has remained unaltered , the time perturbations become relevant will depend on early universe initial conditions .",
    "if the primordial vector amplitude agrees for instance with the ( scalar ) amplitude of density fluctuations , @xmath227 , @xmath228 becomes of order one about @xmath229 @xmath74-folds after the onset of triad domination . by then",
    "the universe has presumably grown anisotropic , because there is no reason to expect that perturbations in the three different triad vectors are correlated .",
    "we ll have to wait several billion years till that happens . at present",
    "the effect is still small , since the relative amplitude has increased at most by a factor of order one . in fact , it is tempting to speculate whether some of the anomalies observed in the cmb radiation @xcite , specially in the quadrupole and octopole ( see however @xcite ) and the related hints of statistical anisotropy @xcite , might be due to such an instability , which sets in once the universe starts to accelerate and mostly affects large scales .",
    "in this paper i have considered whether a vector field could be responsible for the current stage of cosmic accelerated expansion .",
    "the existence of a vector with non - vanishing spatial components turns to be compatible with the isotropy of a friedmann - robertson - walker universe provided the vector is part of a `` cosmic triad '' , i.e. a set of three identical vector fields pointing in mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "a set of three identical self - interacting vectors naturally arises for instance in a gauge theory with @xmath12 or @xmath230 gauge group .",
    "a distinctive property of a cosmic triad is that its equation of state of can become less than @xmath48 , even though its kinetic terms have the conventional form .",
    "the necessary condition is that the self - interaction is `` tachyonic '' , i.e. it naively gives rise to a negative squared vector mass .",
    "although the simple analogy with scalar tachyons suggests that the study of tachyonic vectors is justified , there are also arguments that connect tachyonic vectors to phantom particles @xcite . in analogy to tracking quintessence models @xcite , in this paper",
    "i have explored a particular class of tachyonic models , where the interaction is an inverse power - law .",
    "for appropriate initial conditions , there exist seemingly viable cosmologies where dark energy has an equation of state @xmath231 throughout cosmic history , including today . in top of that",
    ", these models have attractors that render cosmic evolution quite insensitive to initial conditions and yield equations of state sufficiently close to @xmath48 today .",
    "the experimental constraints on the value of the dark energy equation of state restrict the power of the vector self - interaction , while the time at which cosmic acceleration sets in determines its energy scale . within the class of models i have considered , the current limits on the equation of state of dark energy require the vector self - interaction to be a non - analytic function of its squared length .",
    "finally , i have scratched the surface of cosmological perturbation theory in the presence of a cosmic triad .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the violation of the decomposition theorem . in the presence of a vector which has non - vanishing spatial components , scalar , vector and tensor perturbations",
    "do not decouple from each other .",
    "in particular , metric vector perturbations show up in scalar equations , and in the absence of particular symmetries in the perturbations vectors are able to source tensors .",
    "the ( scalar ) time components of the triad vectors are not dynamical , i.e. they are constrained . despite an apparent difficulty , it is possible to solve the constraint also for tachyonic models .",
    "i have also considered solutions of the perturbation equations for a particular set of modes , under the assumption that metric perturbations are negligible . during inflation , radiation and dust domination",
    "the relative perturbations in the triad remain constant .",
    "however , there is a long wavelength instability during the late - time stage of de sitter acceleration , where triad perturbations grow relative to the background .",
    "hence , the time the universe becomes anisotropic depends on early universe initial conditions . for reasonable primordial perturbation amplitudes , the universe is expected to become anisotropic long time after the onset of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the instability of the triad during this epoch also suggests a possible relation between the large angle anomalies in the cmb sky and the onset of cosmic acceleration , but further work is needed to test this idea .",
    "a more careful investigation is also needed to establish whether tachyonic vectors are fully stable , and how the inclusion of metric perturbations affects the behavior of the triad perturbations ( and vice versa ) .",
    "to conclude , at the level of the present analysis it seems that vector fields could indeed be responsible for the present stage of late time cosmic acceleration , though it is yet unclear how quantum mechanics constrains the tachyonic models i have studied here .",
    "this paper is dedicated to isabel .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank sean carroll , sergei dubovsky , vikram duvvuri , wayne hu , lam hui , eugene lim , geraldine servant and paul steinhardt for useful discussions , and the kicp for software assistance .",
    "this work has been supported by the us doe grant de - fg02 - 90er40560 .",
    "in this appendix , i show that a cosmic triad can arise from a non - abelian @xmath12 gauge theory . for that purpose , consider the gauge - invariant yang - mills lagrangian @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the non - abelian field - strength @xmath234 the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath235 encodes the structure constants of the @xmath12 lie - algebra .",
    "the equations of motion of the fields in an arbitrary spacetime are @xmath236 the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) satisfies these equations of motion in the frw universe ( [ eq : frw ] ) if @xmath237 where @xmath238 equation ( [ eq : namotion ] ) agrees with the triad equation of motion ( [ eq : xmotion ] ) .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of the gauge fields is @xmath239 it can be verified that @xmath240 , whereas @xmath241 the self - interaction @xmath78 is again given by equation ( [ eq : nav ] ) .",
    "therefore , the energy density and pressure of the non - abelian gauge fields agree with the ones of the triad , equations ( [ eq : pandrho ] ) .",
    "this equivalence between the triad and the non - abelian gauge fields in the symmetric case we are considering is confirmed by substituting the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) into the actions ( [ eq : action ] ) and ( [ eq : ym ] ) .",
