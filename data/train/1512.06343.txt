    "hyperkhler metrics are ricci - flat with a triple of parallel complex structures .",
    "the metric together with any one of the complex structures specifies a khler geometry with parallel complex - symplectic form .",
    "such manifolds are calabi - yau and form a special class in the berger holonomy classification , see besse  @xcite .    given an isometric circle action preserving each element in the triple , there are at least two different constructions that may be applied to produce manifolds in the same dimension with a new topology and a metric compatible with a triple of complex structures .",
    "the first is the twist construction of  @xcite , which reproduces the t - duality as used in gibbons , papadopoulos and stelle @xcite .",
    "in particular , it includes constructions of strong hktmetrics in dimension four from hyperkhler metrics .",
    "however , many of the examples discussed in  @xcite are incomplete , and it is not clear whether one can derive hyperkhler metrics from the construction . indeed , while the twist construction in  @xcite is easily specialised to generate integrable complex structures , it does tend to destroy symplectic structures that are present . on the other hand",
    "the twist construction has the advantage that is a genuine duality and may easily be inverted .",
    "in contrast , the hyperkhler modification construction @xcite produces hyperkhler manifolds in the same dimension via a hyperkhler moment map construction . when the original manifold is simply - connected , the modification increases the section betti number by one .",
    "away from the zero set of the moment map , the topological set - up is precisely a double fibration picture that is the basis for the twist construction .",
    "however , the recipe for producing the hyperkhler metric from this picture is rather different , and inversion is not apparent .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine exactly how these constructions are related to each other , particularly when the metrics involved are complete .",
    "as the domain of the hyperkhler modification is larger than that of the double fibration , this also enables us to explore some singular behaviour of the twist construction .",
    "we start the paper by giving a brief overview of the twist and modification constructions , describing their properties with respect to completeness .",
    "we also introduce a generalisation of the modification , which has as an ingredient an arbitrary complete hyperkhler four - manifold with circle symmetry in place of flat  @xmath0 in the original construction .",
    "such four - manifolds were classified by bielawski  @xcite under the assumption that the second betti number is finite . in [ sec : hyperk - four - manif ] , we extend his result to the general case , showing that the only other examples are the @xmath1-manifolds of anderson , kronheimer and lebrun @xcite and their taub - nut deformations .",
    "the general strategy we use is that of bielawski s original work , extending the gibbons - hawking ansatz , but with a different approach to the analysis of positive harmonic functions and invocation of the martin boundary . with this in place",
    "we make a local study of the general modification in [ sec : twist ] and show how on dense open sets it may be interpreted as a twist : not of the original hyperkhler metric , but rather of an `` elementary deformation '' obtained by scaling the metric in quaternionic directions generated by the symmetry .",
    "a similar concept of elementary deformation was used in @xcite to describe the hyperkhler / quaternionic khler correspondence when there is a symmetry that preserves only one of the complex structures .",
    "it is now natural to ask when elementary deformations combined with the twist construction lead to hyperkhler metrics .",
    "describes this on the principal locus , showing that these are essentially governed by harmonic functions on  @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to the four - dimensional gibbons - hawking description , these harmonic functions are not necessarily positive .",
    "indeed the twist construction has the virtue of being easily inverted , and the inversion is seen to be governed by the negative of the original harmonic function .",
    "this answers the question of how the hyperkhler modification may be inverted . in [ sec : pseudo - riem - struct ] , we briefly discuss how a similar derivation of which twists are hyperkhler may be obtained in the pseudo - riemannian situation .",
    "the harmonic function controlling elementary deformations whose twist are hyperkhler is allowed to have singularities .",
    "indeed the original modification construction corresponds to a @xmath3 singularity in  @xmath2 . in [ sec : singular - behaviour ] , we dissect what singular behaviour is allowed when twisting between complete metrics .",
    "a close study of the interaction of the circle symmetry with its hyperkhler moment map , shows that many of these singularities are of the type of a standard modification or its inverse .    finally in [ sec :",
    "strong - hkt - metrics ] , we study the use of elementary deformations to twist hyperkhler metrics to strong hktmetrics . for hktgeometries",
    "one has certain type of triple of hermitian structures , that are not necessarily symplectic .",
    "the strong condition is that a certain three - form is closed .",
    "very few examples of such structures are known that are not hyperkhler : following work of joyce  @xcite , and building on spindel et al .",
    "@xcite , grantcharov and poon @xcite showed that bi - invariant metrics on most compact groups of dimension @xmath4 are strong hkt ; barberis and fino @xcite produced other compact examples ; otherwise most known examples , including those in @xcite , are incomplete .",
    "we show that starting with a hyperkhler manifold with circle symmetry , harmonic functions again govern which twists are strong hkt .",
    "complete examples , for example on cotangent bundles of complexified compact lie groups , may be obtained simply by taking this function to be constant .",
