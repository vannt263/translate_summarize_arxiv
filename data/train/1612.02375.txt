    "a random tesselation is a random subdivision of a space into disjoint regions or cells @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most basic random tesselation model partitions the plane @xmath5 into voronoi cells . in order to construct them , a set of random nuclei ( or seeds ) @xmath6 are first distributed , and then , every location of the plane is associated with the nearest seed . when the distribution of the seeds follows the stationary with a finite density @xmath0 ,",
    "the random tesselation is widely - known as the  @xcite . since the concept of is quite fundamental , it accepts a wide range of applications from geo - sciences and astronomy , e.g. ,  @xcite to telecommunications  @xcite .    the statistical properties of planar , e.g. , cell area , perimeter , vertex degree , etc .",
    "have been studied since the early 1950 s  @xcite .",
    "the of the voronoi cell size in two dimensions is unknown , and approximations using the gamma and the log - normal distribution with appropriately selected parameters have been widely adopted  @xcite .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the good fit of the gamma distribution using the nearest neighbour approximation is presented in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", an integral - based scheme is derived to compute various statistics of the including the edge length , the of the distance and angle between neighbouring seeds and vertices , the cell size etc .",
    "following the recent emergence of small cell wireless networks with irregular structure , fundamental tools from stochastic geometry have been adopted to model the deployment of users , base stations and assess the performance . for instance , the gamma approximation for the distribution of cell size in has been used to approximate the of the network load in a typical voronoi cell  @xcite , as well as in , e.g. , to investigate the of in - degree for secure local connectivity  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , wireless networks have finite boundaries and the statistics of a typical voronoi cell may not well represent the properties of cells located close to the boundaries .    in this document ,",
    "we consider a over a square and assume that the location of a seed of the underlying , hereafter the seed @xmath7 , is arbitrarily fixed either at the boundary or , close to the boundary but far from the corner .",
    "firstly , we extend the integral - based method in  @xcite to compute the mean cell size . unlike the in the infinite plane , we show that a unit density in a bounded domain can induce voronoi cells with mean area smaller or larger than unity .",
    "secondly , we show how to compute the second moment of the cell area for the voronoi cell @xmath8 ( that generated by seed @xmath7 ) assuming that the seed @xmath7 is located exactly at the corner of the square or exactly at the boundary but far from the corner . in both cases , we illustrate that the gamma distribution with fitted moments provides an accurate approximation for the distribution of the cell size .    as a potential application",
    ", we use the gamma approximations to study the distribution of in - degree for secure local connectivity in .",
    "we illustrate that at the boundary , it might be more probable to have secure out - connectivity than secure in - connectivity .",
    "this results complements the analysis conducted in  @xcite , where it is shown that in the infinite plane secure in - connectivity is more probable than out - connectivity .",

    "the underlying has unit density , and we denote by @xmath10 the set of seeds generating the voronoi cells , i.e. , @xmath11 . in addition , we consider a seed @xmath7 .",
    "the seed @xmath7 generates the voronoi cell @xmath8 and it might be located ( i ) along the boundary at distance @xmath12 from the corner ( ii ) at distance @xmath13 from the boundary inside the square and far from the corner . due to the slivnyak s theorem ,",
    "the point process @xmath14 is poisson .",
    "let us consider a point @xmath15 with polar coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the point @xmath17 can be interior to some cell , at the boundary separating two cells , or it can also be a vertex . adopting the terminology used in  @xcite , we define the _ void _ of the point @xmath17 to be the disk with center that point , and radius equal to the distance to the nearest seed(s ) . in order to compute the statistics of the cell @xmath8",
    ", we should identify first the probability that the point @xmath17 is interior to that cell .",
    "this would be the case when its void is empty of other seeds , and the seed @xmath7 lies on its circumference . since the underlying has unit density , the probability that the void is empty is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the size of the void . finally , one has to integrate over all points in the domain @xmath20 weighted with their probability of being interior , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , if we consider infinite plane and select the origin at @xmath7 , the mean cell size can be computed as @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath28 .",
    "we place a _ virtual node _ at @xmath7 , either at the corner or at the edge , to study secure in- and out - connectivity at that location .",

    "the mean and the variance of the in - degree can be expressed in terms of the moments of the cell size @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "one has to average the mean and variance of the poisson distribution @xmath33 over the cell size @xmath34 @xmath37    on the other hand , the of the in - degree @xmath38 can only be approximated using , for instance , the fitted gamma distribution for the of the cell size , see section  [ sec : appropdf ] @xmath39    the can be expressed in terms of the gaussian hypergeometric function @xmath40 @xmath41    in fig .",

    "following the same assumptions used to study in - connectivity with secrecy , the _ virtual node _ can securely transmit to a legitimate user if their distance is smaller than the distance between the _ node _ and any eavesdropper .",
    "the distribution of the out - degree is independent of the location @xmath7 of the _ node _ : the quantity @xmath45 is the probability that the next user we meet as we move away from the _ node _ is legitimate .",
    "therefore the out - degree is equal to @xmath46 if we succeed in meeting @xmath46 legitimate users before the first eavesdropper .",
    "it follows that the distribution of the out - degree is geometric with parameter @xmath47  @xcite .",

    "verifying the results in  @xcite , it is more probable to be in - connected than out - connected in the bulk , see fig .",
    "[ fig : isolationprob ] .",
    "however , this is not true in general . in fig .",
    "[ fig : isolationprob ] we see that at the corner and also at the edge ( for a high density of eavesdroppers ) it is more likely to be out - connected than in - connected .    .",

    "instead of using extensive simulations , this letter uses a low - complexity numerical method for computing the mean cell size in a homogeneous poisson voronoi tesselation for seeds located along and/or close to the boundary of the deployment area .",
    "besides the application detailed in the paper , these results can also be used in the performance analysis of finite area cellular networks , e.g. , modeling the mean network load for base stations located close to the network borders . in the foreseen deployments of indoor ultra - dense networks ,",
    "the impact of boundaries can not be neglected . in addition , the calculation of the second moment of the cell size at the corner and at the boundary , and the illustration of the good fit of the gamma distribution , may give enough evidence to continue studying the distribution of cell size in other locations , e.g. , inside the square and close to the corner , more complex bounded geometries , e.g. , three - dimensional voronoi cells , cell size distribution in hyperbolic spaces , etc .    1 j.  moller , `` random tesselations in rd '' , _ advances in applied probability _",
