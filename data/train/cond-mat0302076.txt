    "during the recent upsurge of activity in the field of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , some older questions concerning the weakly interacting bose gas have been revived .",
    "one such un - resolved question is the effect of a weak repulsion on the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "calculations on this question has produced widely dissimilar results : increases and decreases of @xmath0 proportional to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    "have been reported by various authors .",
    "( here @xmath1 is the scattering length . )",
    "it is only during the past 2 - 3 years that the community has been converging toward a consensus .    considering the diverse approaches to the @xmath0 problem , and the variety of issues that have arisen in this connection",
    ", it seems appropriate at this point to attempt to draw some connections between the different approaches , and point out some misconceptions and fine points .",
    "the purpose in this article is to review and comment on existing work , rather than to present new calculations .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the free - gas spectrum , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are bosonic operators . in principle",
    ", one is interested in any possible interaction function @xmath8 , but the simplest possible form is a delta function in real space , so that @xmath9 is momentum - independent .",
    "to first order @xmath10 is related to the @xmath11-wave scattering length @xmath1 by @xmath12 .",
    "a dimensionless measure of the interaction is the quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density .",
    "the program is to examine the shift in the critical temperature @xmath0 , as compared to a noninteracting gas of the same density , as a function of @xmath13 , for small @xmath13 .    in section [ sect_background ] ,",
    "the background is set by summarizing different calculations and basic results .",
    "section [ sect_heart ] contains the comments on various approaches to the @xmath0 problem . in the concluding section [ sect_further ] ,",
    "i suggest some directions for additional calculations .",
    "early predictions for the shift in transition temperature appear in the work of lee , yang and huang , around forty years ago , as summarized in @xcite .",
    "recently , huang has published @xcite a prediction for an increase in @xmath0 due to the inter - particle repulsion , proportional to the square root of the interaction strength , @xmath15 .",
    "schakel in a short note @xcite , and baym _ et al _ in @xcite , have both discussed the problem with this work ; in particular @xcite contains an analysis showing how huang s result is generated spuriously from a truncation of the virial expansion used at mean field level .",
    "a similar spurious result appearing in the literature is that of toyoda @xcite , who in 1982 performed mean - field - like calculations deriving a landau - ginzburg type thermodynamic function .",
    "his prediction was a _",
    "decrease _ of the transition temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "again , this is believed to be an artifact of mean field approximations .",
    "the present understanding is that there is no mean field effect on the transition temperature , and that higher - order correlations are required to find the leading shift in @xmath0 .    a more recent work that also predicts a negative shift in @xmath0 is the canonical - ensemble work of wilkens _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "this work has been critiqued in @xcite .",
    "i discuss some related issues in section [ sect_canonical ] .",
    "in addition , in view of the continuing appearance of negative - shift predictions , i give in section [ sect_direction+ir ] a simple argument for the _ increase _ of the transition temperature due to the addition of a repulsive interaction .",
    "this argument makes use of eq , which is derived independent of any particular method of treating interaction effects .    during the past several years",
    ", a large body of work has been published by baym , lalo and collaborators @xcite , and a number of authors have done followup work @xcite .",
    "these workers predict a positive shift in @xmath0 that to leading order is _ linear _ in the scattering length ; @xmath17 .",
    "attempts to calculate the coefficient @xmath18 , however , have continued to give fluctuating results , and this has prompted the baym group to predict @xcite a logarithmic contribution at the _ next _ order , i.e. , a @xmath19 contribution .",
    "the presence of such a non - analyticity might explain the difficulty in any numerical estimate of @xmath18 .",
    "stoof s renormalization - group analysis @xcite of the three - dimensional bose gas has led to a prediction @xcite of an increase of the transition temperature proportional to @xmath20 , i.e. , a non - analyticity at _ leading _ order .",
    "a leading non - analytic behavior would actually explain even better the uncertain results obtained in attempts to calculate the coefficient @xmath18 , based on the assumption of linear shift @xmath21 .",
    "an older attack on the @xmath0 problem is that of kanno @xcite . in a series of papers ,",
    "kanno introduced a `` quasilinear '' canonical transformation approach to the many - body problem , which he used to calculate ( among other things ) the free energy and hence transition temperature of the bose gas .",
    "since kanno s work has mostly been ignored by the current @xmath0 community , i give a description of his work in section [ sect_kanno ] .",
    "i also show how some of his derivations can be performed in a more transparent way",
    ".    schakel s work on developing an effective theory @xcite of the weakly non - ideal bose gas has led to the prediction @xcite of a shift in the transition temperature that is strictly linear in the interaction .",
    "the connection of this calculation with other approaches has not yet been explored in detail .",
    "some issues are pointed out in section [ sect_schakel ] .",
    "our recent report @xcite addresses the question of @xmath0 within a quasiparticle framework .",
    "other than working out details of a quasiparticle description ( ultraviolet divergence , effect of quasiparticle lifetime ) , we also provide a non - selfconsistent method of regularizing the infrared divergences appearing in the description of the transition point .",
    "this results in a shift of @xmath0 approximately @xmath22  @xmath23 .",
    "the procedure is uncontrolled ; however , this result points strongly to a non - analytic contribution in the dependence of @xmath0 on the interaction .",
    "other relevant calcultaions include kleinert s `` five - loop '' determination @xcite of the coefficient @xmath18 mentioned above , assuming a puely linear leading shift , and the `` linear @xmath24-expansion '' calculations @xcite of de souza cruz _ et al_. kleinert has questioned @xcite the @xmath24-expansion method , but a detailed analysis of the relationship of this approach to others seems to be lacking in the literature .      for a momentum - independent potential , the two mean field contributions to the self - energy ( hartree and fock ) are equal , @xmath25 .",
    "since the self - energy is momentum - independent , it can simply be absorbed into a redefinition of the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath26 here @xmath27 .",
    "the transition now simply corresponds to @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 , and @xmath0 remains unchanged .",
    "the lesson here is that a momentum - dependent self - energy is required for a shift in @xmath0 .    in second - order calculations ,",
    "( e.g. in @xcite , ) it is usual to have the 1st - order self - energy already absorbed in the chemical potential , i.e. , to use @xmath30 as the chemical potential .",
    "this allows one to exclude those second - order diagrams which can be obtained by 1st - order self - energy insertions into 1st - order diagrams .",
    "_ spatially extended interaction_. in a real system , of course , the description of the interaction in terms of a single parameter ( @xmath31 or @xmath1 ) is valid only for very weak interactions or at very low temperatures / densities ; if these conditions are not satisfied one has to take into account the detailed shape of the potential @xmath32 which is not a delta function in real space ( not a constant in momentum space ) any more . in such a case",
    "we get a momentum - dependent fock term , and hence a contribution to @xmath0 from the first - order self - energy . assuming a gaussian @xmath33 of width @xmath1 and height @xmath34 , one gets a correction to the spectrum that can be incorporated as an effective mass @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , resulting in a negative shift @xcite : @xmath36 the negative shift at higher densities is present in liquid helium and presumably in other bose fluids",
    ". however , for weak interactions , this shift is less important than the leading @xmath37 effect , which is the current theoretical challenge .      as a highly correlated liquid",
    ", the properties of liquid helium are not expected to be described well by the dilute weakly - interacting bose gas model .",
    "however , the deviation of the lambda transition temperature ( 2.2k ) , from the bec temperature of an ideal gas with the same density ( 3.1k ) , can be mostly explained using a simple effective mass description . in other words ,",
    "the experimental @xmath0 is reproduced quite closely by replacing the helium atomic mass @xmath38 by a quasiparticle effective mass @xmath38 * in the ideal gas expression @xmath39^{2/3}\\rba n^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "the effective mass in the liquid exceeds the bare mass , because of the inertia of the medium which has to make way for any atom to move .",
    "this results in a lowering of @xmath0 .",
    "the effect is essentially equivalent to that described in the last section for a momentum - dependent interaction .",
    "feynman @xcite calculated a partition function for liquid helium that takes into account the effective mass enhancement described above . using this partition function ,",
    "chapline calculated @xcite a @xmath0 quite close to the actual @xmath40-point of helium .",
    "this is equivalent to using the effective mass in the ideal gas expression for @xmath41 .    according to current understanding ,",
    "therefore , one expects the following variation of @xmath0 with @xmath42 : an initial linear - like increase , followed by a maximum and then a decrease due to the effective - mass mechanism described above , until eventually @xmath43 becomes negative .",
    "this kind of dependence has been seen in the monte - carlo calculation of grter , ceperley , lalo @xcite , and in reppy s experiments @xcite described below .",
    "one could think of studying the @xmath0 problem experimentally , e.g. , in the context of trapped atomic bose gases .",
    "unfortunately , trap effects dominate in the dependence of @xmath0 on the interaction for these systems .",
    "turning on a repulsion for a trapped bose gas causes an expansion of the gas , reducing the density and hence decreasing the transition temperature @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the intrinsic effect under review here , trapping effects on @xmath0 are found at mean - field level already .",
    "a different experimental realization of the weakly non - ideal bose gas is the @xmath45he - vycor system explored by reppy _ et al _ @xcite . here",
    "the small-@xmath13 regime is reached by enormously decreasing the @xmath45he density .",
    "reppy s investigation of the transition temperature shows a linear - like increase of @xmath0 at low @xmath13 , followed by a maximum and a decrease to values lower than @xmath41 .",
    "the general behavior is satisfying , but for the initial increase , the data is not yet good enough to choose between @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48-like behavior .",
    "the work of baym , lalo and collaborators @xcite establishes definitely that a repulsive interaction _ increases _",
    "@xmath0 , and that the dependence of @xmath43 on the interaction is of linear order , as opposed to quadratic or @xmath49 .",
    "one should note , however , that the baym group s work relies heavily on power - counting and dimensional arguments .",
    "this kind of argument typically does not catch logarithmic corrections .",
    "the possibility of leading non - analytic dependence of @xmath43 on the interaction , therefore , needs to be further examined .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the large-@xmath50 calculation @xcite is a reliable indicator that the leading shift is purely linear , because of intuition gained from other systems where large-@xmath50 calculations capture all logarithms .",
    "i would like to point out , however , that the @xmath51 models belong to a different universality class , and have different excitation spectra as compared to the usual ( @xmath52 ) bose gas .",
    "more care is therefore required in interpreting results from the large-@xmath50 approach .",
    "the baym - lalo collaboration seems to have been the first to relate the single - particle spectrum at @xmath0 to the shift @xmath43 .",
    "another noteworthy aspect is the use of ursell operators @xcite , and a corresponding diagram technique , to describe particle correlations .",
    "( as far as i can tell , for this problem , the ursell operator technique does not give any extra information compared to the usual green function techniques . )      once the shift in @xmath0 is related to the modification of the single - particle spectrum , the direction of the shift can be argued using well - known facts about the spectrum of the bose gas .",
    "we will use the following expression for the shift , as appearing in @xcite : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the bose function at the critical point ; @xmath55 ; and @xmath56 is the quasiparticle spectrum at @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath57 .    the expression used by baym _",
    "et al _ @xcite , @xmath58 $ ] , is the high - temperature ( zero matsubara frequency ) version of . noting that the major contribution to comes from the infrared",
    ", one can write approximately @xmath59   \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] this equation might introduce or leave out logarithmic corrections ; however the following argument is unchanged for .    if the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath56 is `` harder '' than the bare spectrum @xmath60 , i.e. , if @xmath56 is sub - quadratic in @xmath61 or quadratic with an effective mass @xmath62 , then the @xmath63 integral dominates and the shift is positive . on the other hand",
    "if the spectrum at the transition point is `` softened '' by the interaction , then eq [ or ] leads to a decrease in the transition temperature .",
    "since the weakly interacting bose gas is known to have a linear ( bogoliubov ) infrared spectrum below the critical temperature , and a quadratic spectrum above @xmath0 , it is extremely reasonable to assume , even without any rg or perturbation - theoretic calculations , that the spectrum at the critical point should be something intermediate between linear and quadratic .",
    "as pointed out above , this means a _ positive _ shift in the transition temperature .",
    "the long - wavelength spectrum at the transition point should be @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the anomalous dimension .",
    "the present system falls in the same universality class as the @xmath66 model , or the @xmath52 quantum rotor model . for this universality class , large-@xmath50 and @xmath67-expansion calculations",
    "give respectively @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and a recent monte carlo calculation @xcite has produced the value @xmath70 .",
    "second - order treatments of the self - energy ( e.g. , the baym group s @xcite and our @xcite work ) over - estimates the modification of the spectrum , giving a @xmath71 infrared behavior ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "on the other hand , some other treatments ( such as stoof s @xcite and schakel s @xcite ) neglect the modification altogether ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the rg flow equations derived by bijlsma & stoof @xcite allow one to numerically locate the transition point .",
    "under rg flow , the physical effective chemical potential flows to positive and negative values , if one starts out respectively in the bose - condensed and the symmetry - unbroken phase .",
    "the critical point is therefore identified by finding parameters for which the chemical potential flows to zero .",
    "stoof finds @xcite that the dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath74 has more structure than purely linear ; @xmath75 .    the differences between stoof s and the baym group s results merit further study .",
    "stoof has suggested @xcite that the source of the difference is not the infrared but the _ ultraviolet_. the correction to the spectrum , @xmath76 , has an ultraviolet @xmath77 behavior in the baym group s treatment @xcite . in the rg framework ,",
    "the corresponding quantity is the running coupling constant @xmath78 , which shows no ultraviolet logarithms in the calcultation of ref @xcite .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic difference in the two predictions for @xmath0 .",
    "stoof also suggests @xcite that an improved rg calculation , including the momentum dependence of the effective two - body interaction at the transition point , would shed light on the difference between the two approaches .      in treating his effective - action theory near the transition point",
    ", schakel @xcite is also faced with infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "one of the remarkable features of this work is an innovative analytic continuation procedure used to regulate ir problems .",
    "baym _ et al _ have remarked @xcite that schakel s prescription ( @xmath79-function regularization ) must be incorrect because it gives an incorrect result for the compressibility of the ideal gas .",
    "this argument , unfortunately , is derived from an equation that schakel derived explicitly for the nontrivial broken - symmetry ground state @xcite of an interacting gas ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the same equations are not applicable to the noninteracting case ( @xmath81 ) for which the structure of the vacuum is different ( more trivial ) .",
    "the situation is therefore more complicated than indicated in baym _",
    "et al _ s note . in response , schakel has provided a more detailed explanation and justification @xcite for the @xmath79-function continuation procedure .",
    "it seems to me that the regularization procedure itself is quite possibly sound .",
    "my concern with schakel s derivation is different  just below the transition point ( broken - symmetry phase ) , schakel uses a quadratic spectrum .",
    "a more accurate treatment would use the phonon - like spectrum @xmath82 .",
    "the effect such a spectrum would have on the thermodynamic potential or on @xmath0 is not clear .",
    "( redoing schakel s @xmath0 calculation with a phonon - like spectrum seems quite difficult . )      in wilkens _",
    "et al _ s paper @xcite , calculations have been performed using a canonical ensemble of @xmath50 particles , and the shift @xmath43 obtained is linear and _ negative _ in the scattering length .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the error lies in evaluating quantities ( derivatives ) at @xmath84 , instead of evaluating them at the expectation value of @xmath83 .",
    "et al _ @xcite have also used finite - size scaling ideas in combination with a first - order calculation in the canonical ensemble , and obtain a positive linear shift .",
    "the idea that the zero - momentum state occupancy @xmath85 becomes `` microscopic '' at and above the transition needs to be clarified .",
    "one finds @xmath86 for @xmath87 , where @xmath50 is the total number of particles , but not necessarily @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , for both the ideal and the interacting bose gas , @xmath89 , which is large compared to @xmath90 though small compared to @xmath50 .    in view of the continuing appearance of the @xmath91 misconception ,",
    "i give here a simple derivation of @xmath92 , together with an expression for the coefficient @xmath93 , for the ideal - gas case .",
    "let us consider the ideal - gas relationship @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 refers to a bose - einstein integral function @xcite . since @xmath97 is small near the transition , one can use the robinson expansion @xcite for @xmath98 . also , inverting @xmath99 one gets @xmath100 . combining these yields , near the transition , @xmath101 since @xmath102 at the transition",
    ", the coefficient of @xmath103 needs to vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath104 the @xmath105 occupancy @xmath85 can actually be calculated for all @xmath106 , using an extra lagrange multiplier @xmath107 conjugate to @xmath85 , in addition to usual chemical potential @xmath108 coupling to @xmath50 .",
    "using this `` two chemical potentials '' formalism @xcite , one can show that for the ideal gas @xmath109 occurs at a temperature @xmath110 , well above the transition point .    for the interacting - gas case , an equation corresponding to is difficult to derive , but finite - size scaling arguments @xcite show that @xmath111 continues to hold , even though the nonideal bose gas belongs to a different universality class .    the definition of the transition point used in ref @xcite is in terms of the probability @xmath112 for having a condensate occupancy @xmath113 .",
    "the claim is that @xmath114 decreases monotonically with @xmath115 for all temperatures above the transition , and has a peak at nonzero @xmath115 for in the condensed phase , and therefore the transition should be defined as the thermodynamic limit of the zero of @xmath116 .",
    "the correspondence between the canonical particle - counting statistics , and the grand - canonical ideas of average occupancies , is not trivial . one important point to note",
    "is that a monotonically decreasing @xmath117 does not imply a zero expectation value for @xmath85 , even though @xmath117 has a maximum at @xmath118 .",
    "( for example , using @xmath119 gives @xmath120 $ ] . ) the stipulation of a monotonically decreasing @xmath117 therefore does not imply a zero or @xmath121 value of @xmath85 at the transition .",
    "kanno developed an unusual approach @xcite to study many - body systems , and also used this approach to calculate bose gas properties @xcite .",
    "_ the formalism_. + kanno s calculation of thermodynamic quantities involves a `` quasilinear '' canonical transformation @xcite of the free - particle operators @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath122 resulting in a hamiltonian having a particular ( diagonal - like ) form .",
    "the formalism involves examining the properties of the coefficients @xmath123 , and the coefficients appearing in the quasi - diagonal hamiltonian . applying this formalism to the weakly repulsive bose gas @xcite , one can derive the bogoliubov spectrum , entropy and pressure above and below the transition , and many other quantities .",
    "kanno does not provide direct connections to the usual language of perturbative many - body theory .",
    "i would like to point out that many of his physical results , if not all , are equivalent to results obtained in more mainstream approaches .",
    "for example , the quantities @xmath124 and @xmath125 , appearing in the second paper of the series @xcite , are equivalent to the normal and anomalous self - energies that appear in modern descriptions .    _",
    "the shift in @xmath0_. + kanno s defines @xcite a modified thermodynamic potential @xmath126 with an unusual lagrange multiplier @xmath30 conjugate to the number of non - condensate particles , @xmath127 , as opposed to the usual chemical potential which is conjugate to the total particle number @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that @xmath128 once @xmath129 is calculated in some approximation , comparing this relation to @xmath130 for the free bose gas at the transition point yields the shift @xmath43 , in terms of the quantity @xmath131 .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 itself is obtained from a consideration of the free energy @xmath132 .",

    "the feynman rules for a diagrammatic perturbative calculation of the modified therodynamic potential @xmath135 are very similar to those for the usual @xmath136 .",
    "one has to use a momentum - dependent chemical potential @xmath137 , and separate out @xmath105 from the momentum - sums at each stage .",

    "uv divergences appearing at second order can be removed by eliminating the bare potential @xmath10 in favor of the 2-body @xmath139-marix , as done for the self - energy in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath140    the expression for @xmath129 obtained in ref @xcite is essentially the same as eq .",
    "_ comparison & remarks_. + the parameter @xmath131 corresponds to the infrared cutoff used in the the non - selfconsistent regulariztion of @xcite .",
    "eq gives the same result for the parameter @xmath131 as that obtained in @xcite for the chemical potential @xmath108 using @xmath141 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath142 represents the energy of a zero - momentum quasiparticle with respect to the chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "therefore eq is equivalent to the usual condition @xmath144 for the bose - condensation point .",
    "the shift @xmath43 obtained using eqs , , is the same as that obtained by our non - selfconsistent regularization scheme in @xcite .",
    "the distinctive idea in kanno s work is the introduction of a modified thermodynamic function @xmath129 such that @xmath145 replaces the right side in the criticality condition @xmath146 .",
    "this bypasses the issue of self - consistency and the modification of the spectrum at @xmath0 , and the use of the chemical potential as a cutoff folllows naturally .",
    "to summarise , this article reviews aspects of the calculation of the @xmath0 shift due to a small repulsive interaction in a bose gas .",
    "this question has generated a number of calculations involving diverse techniques ; the present discussion is a first step toward developing an organized overview of the different approaches .",
    "the issue that needs to be resolved urgently , in my opinion , is the possibility of a logarithm - like correction to the leading shift in @xmath0 .",
    "presumably , a better understanding of the spectrum at the critical point ( both at the infrared and the ultraviolet ) should help settle this issue .",
    "two directions need to pursued in this regard .",
    "first , as suggested by stoof , an improved rg calculation , taking into account the momentum dependence of the effective interaction , would improve the ultraviolet behavior of the spectrum in his formalism .",
    "also , it might be worth retaining the wavefunction renormalization ( critical index @xmath65 ) , which changes the infrared spectrum at @xmath0 from @xmath147 to @xmath148 .",
    "this is neglected in @xcite on the grounds that @xmath65 is small .",
    "a second approach suggests itself when we note that the quasiparticle treatments @xcite have all calculated self - energies in terms of the two - body @xmath139-matrix @xmath149 .",
    "this quantity describes all possible collisions between _ two _ particles , without taking into account the fact that the surrounding medium has an effect on these collisions .",
    "many - body corrections arising from the surrounding gas can be treated by using the many - body @xmath106-matrix , which is the sum of ladder diagrams .",
    "the two - body @xmath139-matrix has no temperature - dependence , while the temperature - dependence of the effective potential ( vanishing at @xmath0 ) is captured by the many - body @xmath106-matrix @xcite .",
    "stoof suggests @xcite that this might explain why the quasiparticle analysis ( perturbative treatment of spectrum modification ) over - adjusts the infrared spectrum .",
    "determining the self - energies and quasiparticle spectra in terms of the many - body @xmath106-matrix has been attempted @xcite , using the relations provided by shi & griffin @xcite between the bare potential @xmath10 , the @xmath139-matrix , and the many - body @xmath106-matrix .",
