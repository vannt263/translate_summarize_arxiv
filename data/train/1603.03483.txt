    "metastable states in finite volume statistical mechanics lattice systems , in which stochastic transition between states are controlled by an energy function , is a well understood phenomenon .",

    "reversible dynamics in @xcite , and the more recent _ potential theoretic approach _",
    "@xcite , further developed in @xcite via the use of the trace process , allow a thorough description of the phenomenon .",
    "the first theory gives a handy definition of the metastable state and a physically clear interpretation of the associated exit time . in the low temperature limit",
    ", it has been proven indeed that the time scale on which the system leaves the metastable state is exponentially large with the inverse temperature , with a mass given by the smallest energy barrier that the system has to overcome along the paths connecting the metastable state to the stable state . moreover",
    ", the theory gives informations about the paths followed by the system during its transition to the stable state .",
    "in particular it ensures that with high probability the system visits one of the configurations , namely , the critical droplets , where the smallest energy barrier is attained before reaching the stable state .",
    "the latter theory , on the other hand , allows a precise estimate of the mean exit time .",
    "in particular it is proven that , measured in terms of the exponential time scale , such a mean time can be written in terms of a quantity , called _ capacity _ , which can be bounded from above and from below by using effective variational principles . under suitable hypotheses on the energy landscape ,",
    "the theory allows the computation of the prefactor and , what is very relevant on physical grounds , shows that it does depend on entropic effects .",
    "indeed , in many specific models the prefactor has been computed explicitly and it turns out to be connected , loosely speaking , to the number of possible ways in which the system can perform its transition to the stable state @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the number of critical droplets that the system can use as a gate towards the stable state .    in this framework",
    "general results are proven under suitable hypotheses on the energy landscape ruling out the possibility to have multiple non degenerate in energy metastable states . in this paper",
    "we approach precisely such a problem and assume that two metastable states are indeed present .",
    "moreover , we chose a peculiar structure of the energy landscape such that the two states form a  series \" , in the sense that , starting from the metastable state at higher energy , the system has to visit necessarily ( in probability in the low temperature limit ) the second one in its way towards the ground state .",
    "we prove a sort of addition rule for the exit time and compute , on the exponential scale , a sharp estimate for the exit time .",
    "we approach this problem in the framework of rather general reversible markov chains .",
    "our aim is that of introducing a model covering both the standard statistical mechanics stochastic lattice models ( e.g. , the metropolis dynamics ) and the reversible probabilistic cellular automata . in this framework",
    "we assume a minimal characterization of the energy landscape sufficient to ensure both the presence of two non degenerate in energy metastable state and their serial structure .    in the last part of the paper we discuss an application of this theory .",
    "indeed , we approach the blume  capel model @xcite , whose metastability behavior has already been studied from different point of views and in different limits in @xcite , and we derive , with a different method , the same result recently proven in @xcite on the sharp estimate of the exit time from the metastable minus one state in the zero chemical potential case .",
    "we mention that the application of our results to the probabilistic cellular automaton studied in @xcite is reported in @xcite .",
