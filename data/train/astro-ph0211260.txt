    "according to the standard disk model  @xcite , the matter forms a thin balanced disk and performs a circular motion with keplerian velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the disk is thin provided that the accreting gas temperature is sufficiently low ( @xmath4 ) , so that @xmath5 introducing the viscosity parameter @xmath6 , relating the stress tensor @xmath7 and the pressure as @xmath8  @xcite , one can obtain @xmath9    general relativity effects result in two important properties : the absence of stable circular orbits at small radii ( @xmath0 for a nonrotating black hole , is the gravitational radius ) , and the transonic regime of accretion . the former means that for @xmath0 a flow can be realized in the absence of viscosity .",
    "the latter results from the fact that according to ( [ 3 ] ) the flow is subsonic outside the marginally stable orbit @xmath10 while at the horizon @xmath11 the flow is to be supersonic .",
    "up to now in the majority of works the procedure of vertical averaging was used , where vertical four - velocity @xmath12 was assumed to be small  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the vertical component of the dynamic force @xmath13 was postulated to be unimportant up to horizon .",
    "here we are going to demonstrate that the assumption @xmath14 is not correct .",
    "as in the bondi accretion , the dynamic force is to be important in the vicinity of the sonic surface .",
    "consider ideal gas accreting onto a black hole inside the marginally stable orbit @xmath15 .",
    "exact equations of motion of ideal media in kerr metric were formulated in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole only .",
    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates ( @xmath16 ) the schwarzschild metric is  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 here indices without caps denote vector components with respect to the coordinate basis @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and indices with caps denote their physical components .",
    "the @xmath23 symbol always represents a covariant derivative in space with @xmath24 metric .",
    "finally , below we always use a system of units with @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a stream function @xmath26 .",
    "this function defines the physical poloidal four - velocity component @xmath27 as @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the particle concentration in the comoving reference frame .",
    "it is the curves @xmath30 const that define lines of flow of the matter .",
    "three integrals of motion are conserved on @xmath31 const surfaces : entropy @xmath32 , energy @xmath33 , and @xmath34-component of angular momentum @xmath35 @xmath36 here @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is internal energy density ) is the relativistic enthalpy . below for simplicity",
    "we use the polytropic equation of state @xmath39 , so that the temperature and the sound velocity can be written as @xcite @xmath40    as a result , the relativistic euler equation@xmath41 can be rewritten in the form of the grad - shafranov scalar equation for the stream function @xmath26 containing three integrals @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath42  @xcite @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{gsrel } \\\\   & & + \\frac{m^{2}\\nabla'_{k}f\\nabla^{k}\\phi}{2\\alpha^{2 } \\varpi^{2}({\\bf\\nabla}\\phi)^{2}d }          + \\frac{64\\pi^{4}}{\\alpha^{2}\\varpi^{2}m^{2 } } \\left(\\varpi^{2}e\\frac{{\\rm d}e}{{\\rm d}\\phi } -\\alpha^{2}l\\frac{{\\rm d}l}{{\\rm d}\\phi}\\right ) -16\\pi^{3}nt\\frac{{\\rm d}s}{{\\rm d}\\phi}=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the @xmath44 derivative acts on all the variables except the quantity @xmath45 . here",
    "the thermodynamical function @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . \\label{b10}\\ ] ] to make the system complete we need to supply grad - shafranov equation  ( [ gsrel ] ) with the relativistic bernoulli equation @xmath49 ; the latter with the help of ( [ b3 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath50",
    "first of all , let us consider the subsonic region in the very vicinity of the marginally stable orbit @xmath51 where the poloidal velocity is much smaller than that of sound . then equation ( [ gsrel ] ) can be significantly simplified by neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath52 . as a result , we have @xmath53 this equation describing the subsonic flow is elliptical . hence , it is necessary to specify five boundary conditions on the surface of the last stable orbit @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "we consider below the case where the radial velocity is constant on the surface @xmath58 and the toroidal four - velocity is exactly equal to @xmath59 : @xmath60 here @xmath61 corresponds to the plane flow at the marginally stable orbit , and we introduced the new angular variable @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) which is counted off from the equator in the vertical direction .",
    "next , we suppose that the velocity of sound is also a constant on the surface @xmath58 : @xmath64 for @xmath39 this means that both the temperature @xmath65 and the relativistic enthalpy @xmath66 are also constant on this surface . it is necessary to stress that , according to ( [ 3 ] ) , for nonrelativistic temperature of the accreting gas @xmath67 we have a small parameter @xmath68 . finally , as the last ,",
    "fifth , boundary condition it is convenient to specify the entropy @xmath42 .",
    "introducing now the values @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one can rewrite the invariants @xmath33 and @xmath35 as @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the angle for which @xmath73 .",
    "in other words , the function @xmath74 has the meaning of a theta angle on the last stable orbit connected with a given point ( @xmath75,@xmath76 ) by a line of flow @xmath77 const .",
    "in particular , @xmath78 .",
    "first of all , we see that condition @xmath79 const ( [ invval ] ) allows us to rewrite equation ( [ main ] ) in a simpler form @xmath80 next , as one can show  @xcite , for @xmath81 , the r.h.s",
    ". of equation ( [ main ] ) describes the transverse balance of a pressure gradient and a gravitational force , whereas the l.h.s .",
    "corresponds to the dynamic term @xmath82 . at the marginally stable orbit it is of the order of @xmath83 and may be dropped .",
    "it is therefore natural to choose the entropy @xmath42 from the condition of a transverse balance on the surface @xmath58 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is determined from the boundary condition ( [ invval ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath86 owing to ( [ c0 ] ) , relation ( [ sp ] ) corresponds to the standard concentration profile @xmath87 finally , definition ( [ b2 ] ) results in the following relationship between functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 : @xmath90 hence , due to ( [ invval ] ) , ( [ np ] ) , and ( [ d3 ] ) , the invariant @xmath35 can be directly determined from the boundary conditions as well .",
    "equation ( [ main ] ) together with boundary conditions ( [ new ] ) , ( [ invval ] ) , ( [ sp ] ) , ( [ np ] ) , and ( [ d3 ] ) determines structure of the inviscid subsonic flow inside the marginally stable orbit .",
    "for example , for @xmath91 we obtain using ( [ up2full ] ) @xmath92 here the quantity @xmath93 , where @xmath94 depending on the radius @xmath75 only , is a poloidal four - velocity of a free particle having zero poloidal velocity for @xmath58 .",
    "as we see , @xmath95 increases very slowly when moving away from the last stable orbit .",
    "therefore , the contribution of @xmath95 turns out to be negligibly small in the subsonic region .",
    "an important conclusion can be drawn directly from ( [ uup ] ) in which for the equatorial plane we have @xmath96 assuming @xmath97 and neglecting @xmath95 , we find the velocity of sound @xmath98 on the sonic surface @xmath99 , @xmath100 : @xmath101 as we see , @xmath102 .",
    "next , as the entropy @xmath103 remains constant along the flow lines , the gas concentration remains approximately constant along the flow lines ( @xmath104 ) as well .",
    "in other words , in agreement with the bondi accretion , the subsonic flow can be considered incompressible . on the other hand , because the radial velocity increases from @xmath105 to @xmath102 , i.e. , for @xmath67 ( @xmath106 ) it changes over several orders of magnitude , the disk thickness @xmath107 should change in the same proportion owing to the continuity equation ( see fig . [ figure ] ) @xmath108 as a result , a rapid decrease of the disk thickness should be accompanied by the appearance of vertical component of velocity which also should be taken into account in euler equation ( [ euler ] ) .    indeed , as one can find analyzing asymptotic of equation ( [ main ] )  @xcite , in the vicinity of the sonic surface located at @xmath109 , where the logarithmic factor @xmath110^{2/3 } \\approx 5 - 7 $ ] , the components of the velocity and the pressure gradient in the limit @xmath111 can be presented as @xmath112 on the other hand , near the sonic surface the radial scale @xmath113 determining the radial derivatives becomes as small as the transverse dimension of a disk : @xmath114 .",
    "hence , logarithmic derivative @xmath115 can be evaluated as @xmath116 . as a result",
    ", both components of the dynamic force @xmath117 do become of the order of the pressure gradient .",
    "to check our conclusion one can consider flow structure in the vicinity of the sonic surface in more detail . because the smooth transonic flow is analytical at a singular point , one can write @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "here we assume that all the three invariants @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath103 are already given .",
    "hence , the problem needs one extra boundary condition . now comparing the appropriate coefficients in bernoulli ( [ up2full ] ) and full stream equation ( [ gsrel ] )",
    ", one can obtain neglecting terms @xmath122 @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "as we see , coefficients ( [ a_0])([eta3 ] ) are expressed through the radial logarithmic derivative @xmath125 .",
    "they have clear physical meaning .",
    "so , @xmath126 gives the compression of flow lines : @xmath127 .",
    "in agreement with ( [ compr ] ) we have @xmath128 .",
    "further , @xmath129 corresponds to the slope of the flow lines with respect to the equatorial plane . as @xmath130 , the compression of stream line finishes somewhere before the sonic surface ,",
    "so inside the sonic radius @xmath131 the stream lines diverge . on the other hand , as @xmath132 , for @xmath133",
    "the divergency is still very weak .",
    "hence , in the vicinity of the sonic surface the flow has a form of an ordinary nozzle ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . finally , as @xmath134",
    ", one can conclude that the transverse scale of the transonic region @xmath135 is the same as the longitudinal one .",
    "the latter point suggests a very important consequence that the transonic region is essentially two - dimensional , and it is impossible to analyze it within the standard one - dimensional approximation .",
    "let us stress that it is rather difficult to connect the sonic characteristics @xmath136 with physical boundary conditions on the marginally stable orbit @xmath58 ( for this it is necessary to know all the expansion coefficients in ( [ expansionn ] ) and ( [ expansionthetam ] ) ) . in particular , it is impossible to formulate the restriction on five boundary conditions ( [ new ] ) , ( [ c0 ] ) and ( [ sp ] ) resulting from the critical condition on the sonic surface . nevertheless , the estimate @xmath116 makes us sure that we know the parameter @xmath125 to a high enough accuracy .",
    "then , according to ( [ a_0])([eta3 ] ) , all the other coefficients can be determined exactly .",
    "using now expansions ( [ expansionn ] ) and ( [ expansionthetam ] ) , one can obtain all other physical parameters of the transonic flow .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath137 , \\nonumber   \\\\   c_{\\rm s}^2 & = & c_*^2     \\left[1+\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)\\eta_1 h +          \\frac{1}{6}(\\gamma -1 ) \\ , \\frac{a_0 ^ 2}{c_0 ^ 2}\\theta^2         - \\frac{1}{3}(\\gamma - 1)(\\gamma+1 ) \\eta_1 ^ 2           \\theta^2     \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , a shape of the sonic surface @xmath138 has the standard parabolic form @xmath139",
    "because the pressure gradient becomes insignificant in supersonic region , the matter moves here along the trajectories of free particles . neglecting @xmath140 term in the @xmath141-component of relativistic euler equation  ( [ euler ] ) , we have ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath142 here @xmath143 can be easily expressed in terms of radius : @xmath144 where .",
    "we also introduce dimensionless functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 : @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "using now ( [ theuler ] ) and definitions above , we obtain an ordinary differential equation for @xmath145 @xmath149 next , analyzing equation ( [ up2full ] ) , one can conclude that @xmath150 as @xmath151 . on the other hand , @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the following approximation should be valid throughout @xmath154 region : @xmath155 , where , owing to ( [ w2 ] ) , @xmath156 .",
    "the results of calculations are presented on fig .",
    "[ figure ] . as we see , in the supersonic region the flow performs transversal oscillation about the equatorial plane , their frequency independent of the amplitude",
    ". once diverged , the flow converges once again at the point @xmath157 ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) on the equatorial plane .",
    "such oscillation can be easily understood .",
    "indeed , as one can see from ( [ uup ] ) , for @xmath67 poloidal motion remains nonrelativistic for @xmath160 .",
    "hence , it is possible to use the nonrelativistic equation @xmath161 where @xmath162 . because the spatial amplitude of oscillations @xmath163 is small compared with @xmath164 ,",
    "one can write @xmath165 ( see ( [ new ] ) ) , @xmath15 , and @xmath166 .",
    "this gives @xmath167 $ ] , @xmath168 in full agreement with exact calculations .",
    "clearly , additional consideration is necessary to determine the flow structure for @xmath169 .",
    "nevertheless , one can be sure that the accretion disk thickness , though oscillating in the supersonic region , remains as small as in the region of stable orbits : @xmath170 .",
    "as was shown , the diminishing disk thickness in the vicinity of the sonic surface inevitably leads to the emergence of the vertical velocity component of the accreting matter . as a result , the dynamic term @xmath171 in the vertical balance equation can not be omitted .",
    "it is necessary to stress that whereas at the sonic surface both components of dynamic term @xmath172_{\\theta}$ ] ( [ w6 ] ) become of the same order of magnitude as the pressure gradient , the role of the gravitational term remains unimportant : @xmath173 , i.e. , it is @xmath174 times smaller than the leading terms . as a result ,",
    "the structure of a thin transonic disk is quite similar to that of an ordinary planar nozzle .",
    "for this reason the critical condition on the sonic surface does not restrict the accretion rate .",
    "we suppose that for a given accretion rate it determines vertical component of the velocity on the marginally stable orbit which does not affect the flow structure . finally , inside the sonic surface @xmath131 the pressure term @xmath140 becomes unimportant , so the thickness of the disk is determined by the form of ballistic trajectories .",
