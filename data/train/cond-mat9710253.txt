    "granular superconductors ( sc ) are composed of a very large number of small ( micron - size ) superconductive grains which are coupled together due to the josephson tunnelling ( or , in some cases , due to the proximity effect ) .",
    "these systems are inherently disordered due to randomness in the sizes of grains and in their mutual distances .",
    "usually the strength of josephson coupling between grains is rather weak , so the maximum josephson energy of the contact between two grains is much below the intragrain superconductive condensation energy .",
    "therefore granular sc can be considered as systems with a two - level organization : their short - scale properties are determined by the superconductivity of individual grains , whereas the macroscopic sc behaviour is governed by the weak intergrain couplings . in the treatment of the latter",
    ", one can neglect any internal structure of sc grains and describe them just by the phases @xmath5 of their superconductive order parameters @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the phase difference induced by the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whereas the coupling strengths @xmath10 are proportional to the maximum josephson currents : @xmath11 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath8 in eq.([ham ] ) is the sum of the vector potential @xmath12 of the external magnetic field @xmath13 and of the josephson currents - induced vector potential @xmath14 . in the absence of external magnetic field ,",
    "the lowest - energy state for the `` hamiltonian '' ( [ ham ] ) is , clearly , a macroscopically superconductive state with all phases @xmath5 equal to each other .",
    "thus that granular sc system looks similar to the random xy ferromagnet with randomness in the values of the coupling strengths @xmath10 s ( apart from the possible role of the induced vector potential @xmath14 which will be dicussed later ) ; within this analogy the role of xy `` spin components '' is taken by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .    the situation becomes a lot more complicated in the presence of non - zero external magnetic field @xmath13 , which makes the system _ randomly frustrated _",
    "( since magnetic fluxes penetrating plaquettes between neighbouring grains are random fractional parts of @xmath17 ) . when the external field is sufficiently strong , @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 is the characteristic intergrain distance ) , the random phases @xmath20 become of the order of @xmath21 or larger , which means complete frustration of the intergrain couplings ",
    "i.e. the system is then expected to resemble the xy _",
    "spin glass_. actually the random josephson network in a magnetic field is not exactly identical to the xy spin glass due to the following reasons @xcite : i ) .",

    "the effects produced by the self - induced magnetic field @xmath27 are weak and can be neglected ( the quantitative criterion will be discussed later on ) , so that phases @xmath20 can be considered as being fixed by the external field .    the model described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with fixed @xmath20 s and @xmath28",
    "is usually called `` gauge glass '' model .",
    "it is expected on the basis of the analytical @xcite as well as numerical @xcite results that the gauge glass model in 3d space exhibits a true phase transition into a low - temperature glassy superconductive ( nonergodic ) state .",
    "the mean - field theory of such a low - temperature state shows @xcite that it is characterized by the presense of a finite effective penetration depth for the _ variation _ of an external field , nonzero macroscopic critical current , and the absense of a macroscopic meissner effect . the full model ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath29 s containing contribution from @xmath27",
    "is sometimes called `` gauge glass with screening '' @xcite .",
    "the effect of screening on the presence and properties of the phase transition into a glassy state is not completely clear ; some numerical results @xcite indicate the absence of a true phase transtion in a 3d model with screening .",
    "quantitatively , the strengh of screening is determined by the ratio @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the characteristic inductance of an elementary intergrain current loop @xcite . in the ceramics with @xmath32 ,",
    "screening effects become important on a long - distance scale @xmath33",
    "only ( i.e. they are similar to the strongly type - ii superconductors with disorder ) .    apart from its relevance for the description of granular superconductors , the gauge glass model with screening is rather often considered ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) as a simplified model describing the large - scale behaviour of disordered bulk type - ii superconductors in the mixed state ( so - called vortex glass problem ) .",
    "actually it is unclear a priori how these two problems are related ; an obvious difference between them is that the basic ingredient of the latter is the vortex lattice which is clearly an anisotropic object , whereas the former does not contain any prescribed direction in the 3d space . on the other hand , the granular superconductor in a moderate magnetic field @xmath34",
    "may be considered as a kind of disordered type - ii superconductor , where the notion of a hypervortex ( which is the macroscopic analogue of the abrikosov vortex ) can be introduced @xcite .",
    "therefore , the macroscopic properties of a granular network at @xmath35 may resemble those of the vortex glass ; in such a scenario a phase transtion between vortex glass and gauge glass phases would be expected in a granular superconductive network at @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this subject ) .",
    "recently , it was noted that granular superconductors may become glassy even in the absence of external magnetic field , if a large enough part of josephson junctions are anomalous , i.e. their minimum josephson coupling energy corresponds to a phase difference @xmath37 instead of @xmath38 ( so - called @xmath21-junctions ) .",
    "two completely different origins of @xmath21-junctions were proposed : mesoscopic fluctuations in dirty superconductors @xcite and the pairing with non - zero momentum @xcite .",
    "recent experiments revealing the @xmath4-wave nature of pairing in high - temperature superconductors @xcite indicate the possibility of observing glassy superconductive behaviour in htsc ceramics in virtually zero magnetic field .",
    "note that ceramics with equal concentrations of usual and @xmath21-junctions are completely equivalent ( if screening effects can be neglected ) to the @xmath39 spin glass .",
    "contrary to the 3d gauge glass model , the xy spin glass in 3d is expected to have no true thermodynamic phase transition at finite temperature @xcite ; recently , it has been suggested that the xy spin - glass and d - wave ceramic superconductor might have a new equilibrium ordered phase , the so - called chiral - glass phase @xcite .",
    "however , these issues are hardly relevant for the measurable response at temperatures much below `` bare '' glass transition temperature @xmath40 , which we consider in this paper .",
    "experimental studies of granular superconductors reveal @xcite an appearance of magnetic irreversibility ( a difference between meissner and shielding magnetizations or , in other terms , between field cooled ( f.c . ) and zero field cooled ( z.f.c . ) magnetizations ) below some temperature @xmath40 , which is lower than the sc transition temperature @xmath41 of the grains .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the magnetic response in such systems is usually complicated by the mixing of contributions from individual grains and from the intergrain currents .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a method which makes it possible to extract from the raw data on d.c .",
    "magnetic response the intergrain contribution and to compare its behaviour with existing theoretical predictions .",

    "the sample was fabricated by standard solid state reaction of la@xmath43o@xmath44 , srco@xmath44 and cuo @xcite .",
    "mixed powder was pressed into pellets which were sintered in air at @xmath45c for 12 hours . the material was then submitted to three cycles of regrinding , sifting to @xmath46 , pressing and sintering again at @xmath47c for 12 hours .",
    "samples prepared in two successive runs were used in this study . in the first one ( sample a )",

    "grains sizes were in the range 1  10 @xmath53 .",
    "room temperature x - ray powder diffraction patterns showed the presence of a small amount ( @xmath54 ) of the non superconductive compound la@xmath55sr@xmath56cu@xmath43o@xmath57 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the general analysis of the magnetic response data obtained on two different samples ( a and b ) of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3   ceramics is presented and the intergrain ( josephson ) contribution to the overall response is extracted .",
    "section iii is devoted to the detailed study of the magnetic response of josephson intergrain network in the low - field range .",
    "it is found that the macroscopic critical current is suppressed considerably ( by a factor 2 ) , in a magnetic field of only about @xmath58 .",
    "the lower - field d.c.response to field variations of order @xmath59 was analyzed for the f.c .",

    "the data at @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are shown to be compatible with the bean critical - state picture @xcite and the low - field critical current value is identified .",
    "the rest of the data are in a sharp contrast with bean - model predictions : the screening current _ grows sublinearly _ ( approximately as a square root ) with increasing exitation field .",
    "very low field , low frequency a.c .",
    "measurements are presented , which reveal the strongly irreversible nature of that anomalous response .",
    "a new phenomenological model is proposed for the treatment of these data .",
    "its first predictions are found to be in a reasonable agreement with the data . in section iv",
    ", the theoretical analysis of our experimental results is given in terms of the existing theories of `` gauge - glass '' state .",
    "it is shown that the observed transition temperature to the low - temperature state of the network and the magnitude of the ( low-@xmath66 ) critical current are in sharp contradiction with the ( usual ) assumption that the zero - field granular network is unfrustrated .",
    "on the contrary , under the assumption of a strongly frustrated network at @xmath67 , all basic measured parameters of the ceramic network are in mutual agreement .",
    "we believe that these estimates indicate the existence of a large proportion of @xmath21-junctions in the la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3   ceramics , possibly due to the @xmath4-wave nature of superconductivity in cuprates . the section v is devoted to the development of a new model of diamagnetic response in glassy superconductors , which is necessary for the description of the anomalous data described at the end of section iii .",
    "this new model ( in some sense , intermediate between the bean @xcite and the campbell @xcite ones ) is based on two ideas : i ) the existence of two characteristic `` critical '' currents ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , and ii ) the fractal nature of free energy valleys in the ceramic network .",
