    "direct optical imaging of nearby stars has emerged as a potentially viable method for detecting extrasolar terrestrial planets , buoyed by new techniques for controlling diffracted and scattered light in high - dynamic - range space telescopes ( see , e.g. , the review by kuchner & spergel 2003 ) .",
    "these techniques boost a telescope s ability to separate a planet s light from the light of its host star . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the sun outshines the earth by a factor of nearly @xmath0 ; this contrast ratio is @xmath1 times larger than the contrast ratio in the mid - infrared @xcite . but",
    "to offset the higher dynamic range requirements of visible - light planet finding , optical techniques offer freedom from large , multiple - telescope arrays @xcite , cryogenic optics , and background light from zodiacal and exozodiacal dust @xcite , while providing access to @xmath2 and @xmath3 biomarkers @xcite , surface features @xcite , the total atmospheric column density @xcite , and even potentially the `` red edge '' signal from terrestrial vegetation @xcite .    of the obstacles to achieving the necessary dynamic range in a single - dish optical telescope",
    ", the diffracted light background appears relatively manageable .",
    "for example , maintaining the scattered light background at the level of the expected signal from the planet poses a greater challenge ; this task requires a r.m.s .",
    "wavefront accuracy of @xmath4    @xcite over the critical spatial frequencies .",
    "however , techniques for managing the diffracted light may dictate the general design of a planet - finding telescope and the planet search and characterization strategy .",
    "optical techniques for controlling diffracted light in planet - imaging telescopes have centered on two main designs : specially shaped and/or apodized pupils @xcite and classical coronagraphs @xcite . shaped and apodized",
    "pupils produce a point spread function whose diffraction wings are suppressed in some regions of the image plane .",
    "a classical coronagraph explicitly removes the on - axis light from the optical train by reflecting or absorbing most of it with an image mask and diffracting the remainder onto an opaque lyot stop .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that a classical coronagraph performs best with a `` band - limited '' image mask .",
    "different band - limited masks offer high performance for planet searching or planet characterization . for planet characterization ,",
    "the @xmath5 amplitude transmissivity mask ( @xmath6 intensity transmissivity ) introduced in @xcite can achieve 80% throughput for a planet at 4@xmath7 . with this high throughput , a 10 m by 4 m telescope can detect a planetary biomarker in @xmath81/3 of the time needed by alternative designs ( e.g. , an 8 m square apodized aperture ) .",
    "a band - limited mask of the form @xmath9 ( see table  1 ) has both excellent throughput and large search area . with any band - limited mask ,",
    "an ideal coronagraph eliminates identically all of the on - axis light , though pointing errors and the stellar size contribute to a finite leakage @xcite .",
    "a band - limited mask can operate with a pupil of any shape as long as it has uniform transmissivity .",
    "but because they interact with focused starlight , all coronagraphic image masks face severe construction tolerances .",
    "errors in the mask intensity transmissivity of @xmath10 on scales of @xmath7 near the center of the mask can scatter enough light into the field of view to scuttle a planet search @xcite . painting a graded - transmissivity mask requires a steady hand !",
    "this requirement has cast the classical coronagraph in an unfavorable light , despite its potential high performance and flexibility .    in this paper",
    ", we offer a way around this pitfall of classical coronagraphy : an easy - to - manufacture class of image masks .",
    "we illustrate a family of binary image masks which offer a savings in construction tolerances of @xmath11 orders of magnitude compared to graded image masks , analogous to the advantage of using binary rather than graded pupil masks @xcite .",
    "these `` notch filter '' masks offer the same planet search and characterization advantages as ideal band - limited masks , providing a robust , practical means of controlling diffracted light in a planet - finding coronagraph .",
    "we begin by reviewing the theory of band - limited image masks .",
    "we retain the notation of @xcite ; image plane quantities have hats and pupil plane quantities do not .",
    "figure  [ fig : cartoon ] illustrates schematically how a coronagraph works ; light passes through the pupil and converges on an image mask , then the pupil is re - imaged onto a lyot stop .",
    "starlight focused on the center of the image mask diffracts to the pupil edges , where the lyot stop can block it , as shown on the left of the figure .",
    "light from an off - axis planet diffracts all around the second pupil plane , as shown on the right of the figure , and largely passes through the lyot stop .",
    "a band - limited mask has a transmission function chosen to diffract all the light from an on - axis source to angles within @xmath12 of the edges of the pupil , as shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , so that a well - chosen lyot stop can block identically all of that diffracted light .",
    "such an image mask typically consists of a series of dark rings or stripes .",
    "the parameter , @xmath13 , is the bandwidth of the mask .",
    "a mask can be described by an amplitude transmissivity , @xmath14 , and intensity transmissivity @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are cartesian coordinates in the image plane .",
    "image masks are generally opaque ( @xmath18 ) in the center ( @xmath19 ) and close to transparent ( @xmath20 ) away from the center , in the search area . to understand the need for band - limited pupil masks",
    ", we must examine the fourier transform of @xmath14 , given by @xmath21 the amplitude transmissivity of a completely transparent mask has only one fourier component , at zero frequency , i.e. @xmath22 .    figure  [ fig : phasor ] illustrates the operation of a mask with one cosine component besides the zero - frequency component , the @xmath5 mask ( @xmath6 intensity transmissivity ) described in @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the amplitude transmissivity of this mask consists of three delta functions : @xmath23 this mask is the simplest example of a band - limited mask .",
    "the amplitude transmissivity , @xmath14 , multiplies the field amplitude in the image plane . in the pupil plane , on the other side of a fourier transform ,",
    "this multiplication becomes a convolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasor]a illustrates the convolution of the amplitude of the pupil field of an monochromatic on - axis source and the function , @xmath24 , given in equation  [ eq : threedeltas ] .    in the convolution ,",
    "each @xmath25-function from equation  [ eq : threedeltas ] generates a weighted copy of the pupil field  a virtual pupil .",
    "we represent each copy of the field as a circle filled with @xmath26 signs or @xmath27 signs .",
    "the circular shape represents a circular aperture , though any aperture shape will do . since the central @xmath25-function has twice the weighting of the other @xmath25-functions , the @xmath26 signs have twice the density of the @xmath27 signs in figure  [ fig : phasor]a .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasor]b depicts the field in the second pupil plane , the sum of the three virtual pupil fields shown in figure  [ fig : phasor]a . in the center of figure",
    "[ fig : phasor]b , the densities of @xmath26 and @xmath27 signs are equal ; for every @xmath26 sign , there is a @xmath27 sign . in this region ,",
    "the fields cancel to zero .",
    "elsewhere the fields do not cancel .",
    "the next optical element in the coronagraph beam train is a lyot stop , which transmits light in the center of the pupil plane , but blocks the regions where the fields do not cancel .",
    "a given lyot stop blocks the light diffracted by a range of fourier components .",
    "if the the lyot stop blocks a fraction , @xmath13 , of the pupil radius at the pupil edges , it will block the diffracted light from all spatial frequency components in the mask with spatial frequency @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the telescope diameter , and @xmath30 is the wavelength .",
    "one can create a mask which contains any or all of the cosine fourier components at these low frequencies which the lyot stop will still match ; this family of masks which has power in only a limited range of low spatial frequencies is the family of band - limited masks .",
    "we can use @xmath13 to refer to the bandwidth of a lyot stop or the bandwidth of an image mask matched to that lyot stop .    likewise ,",
    "a given ideal lyot stop and mask combination can work at a range of wavelengths .",
    "the bandwidth of a given image mask is proportional to @xmath30 , but the bandwidth of a given lyot stop is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , a given lyot stop / image mask combination will work at all wavelengths shorter than the wavelength for which it was designed .",
    "however , it can only have optimum throughput at one wavelength .",
    "@xcite display a variety of one - dimensional band - limited mask amplitude transmissivity functions . a useful compromise between search area and throughput",
    "is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the minimum value of @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the throughput of a lyot stop matched to a one - dimensional mask function is roughly @xmath36 .",
    "band - limited masks with additional fourier components in the @xmath37 direction are also possible , though to use these masks , one must stop the top and bottom of the pupil plane as well as the left and right .",
    "the throughput of such a lyot stop is roughly @xmath38 .    at the request of nasa , a university - industry team associated with ball aerospace and technologies",
    "corporation studied a design for a space - based visible - light planet finding telescope using a single 4  m by 10  m elliptical primary mirror .",
    "this team estimated that with a classical coronagraph using a gaussian image mask , the design could detect an earth twin orbiting a g2 v star at a distance of 10 pc in 0.86 hours , including time for 2 rotations of the image plane @xcite .",
    "once the location of the planet was known , a water band in the planet s atmosphere could be detected spectroscopically in 0.14 days , and an @xmath2 band could be detected in 0.8 days . if a single band - limited image mask of the form @xmath39 were used instead of a gaussian mask , the lyot stop could be substantially widened , increasing the throughput , and the detection and characterization times would be reduced by a factor of roughly 0.7 , to 0.6 hours for detection , 0.1 days for @xmath40 , and 0.6 days for @xmath2 .",
    "ideally , a band - limited mask combined with a lyot stop completely blocks all on - axis starlight from reaching the second image plane , and attenuates off axis starlight to an easily manageable level . however , @xcite discuss two significant limitations on the band - limited mask performance : pointing errors and errors in mask construction .",
    "none of the time estimates in the ball report accounts for either of these errors , which affect all masks , band - limited or not .",
    "a mildly apodized lyot stop can compensate for the leakage due to pointing errors @xcite . apodizing",
    "the lyot stop carries a throughput penalty , but even with this loss , the ideal classical coronagraph outfitted with a choice of band - limited masks remains by far the fastest of the idealized designs described in the ball report for planet detection .",
    "mask errors are more serious ; all graded image masks suffer from impractically tight construction tolerances .",
    "we will show how to dramatically loosen the construction requirements by building binary masks .",
    "to build a binary mask that retains the advantages of band - limited masks we will need to use more of the available function space for mask design .",
    "section  [ sec : bandlimitedmasks ] reviewed the utility of masks whose fourier components are limited to spatial frequencies @xmath28 .",
    "however , there is another range of spatial frequencies available for mask design : as @xcite described in their discussion of mask errors , high spatial frequency terms that diffract light well outside the opening in the lyot stop do not affect the performance of a mask",
    ". we can add high spatial - frequency terms , with @xmath41 , to the mask amplitude transmissivity function without altering the light admitted through the coronagraph as long as @xmath42 figure  [ fig : powerspectrum ] shows that the spatial frequency response of a general image mask which can completely suppress on - axis light resembles the spectral response of a notch filter .",
    "we can use the degrees of freedom available at high spatial frequencies to design masks which are relatively easy to construct to the necessary tolerances .",
    "for example , the transmissivity of a band - limited mask is analytic , so it can not have a constant value over any finite region .",
    "however , the transmissivity of a notch filter mask need not obey this restriction .",
    "the remainder of this paper will be a discussion of notch filter masks that take advantage of this opportunity .",
    "sampling a function forces its fourier transform to be periodic .",
    "we can harness this aliasing effect to generate useful notch filter mask functions .",
    "we will illustrate this principle first by considering mask functions of one variable only .",
    "such a mask function can be realized as a striped mask as shown in @xcite .",
    "these functions can also be used as parts to construct two - dimensional masks .    throughout our discussion",
    ", @xmath43 will be a function which can serve as the amplitude transmissivity of a band - limited mask : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the fourier transform , @xmath46 , of this function only has power at spatial frequencies @xmath47 .",
    "such a function automatically satisfies equation  [ eq : cancellation ] .",
    "we shall use @xmath43 to create notch filter functions , @xmath48 , that mimic @xmath43 at low spatial frequencies .",
    "actual image masks are constructed using finite - sized tools offering limited contrast and spatial resolution .",
    "we can design notch filter masks with this contraint in mind .",
    "multiply @xmath43 by a comb filter with spacing @xmath49 to get a sampled version of @xmath43 , and convolve the result with a function @xmath50 , to get    @xmath51    where @xmath52 ranges over all integers and @xmath53 indicates convolution . for generality , we have allowed the sampling points to be offset from the mask center by a fraction @xmath54 of @xmath49 .",
    "the kernel , @xmath50 , can represent the `` beam '' of a nanofabrication tool .",
    "it should be normalized so that @xmath55 , and @xmath50 must be everywhere @xmath56 , so @xmath57 remains @xmath58 .",
    "this function we have created , @xmath59 , only has power at @xmath60 .",
    "its power spectrum resembles figure  [ fig : powerspectrum ] as long as the spacing between the samples satisfies the requirement @xmath61 if @xmath62 , then @xmath59 typically has an imaginary component .",
    "however , if equation  [ eq : deltax ] holds , @xmath59 is always purely real at low frequencies ( @xmath63 )",
    ".    in general , @xmath59 does not match @xmath46 at low frequencies , because the envelope function , @xmath64 , in equation  [ eq : tsampled ] does not generally equal unity over the whole bandwidth of @xmath43 . rather , the envelope function tends to cause @xmath59 to violate equation  [ eq : cancellation ] .",
    "however , we can often correct for this effect and create a function , @xmath65 , which satisfies equation  [ eq : cancellation ] by subtracting a constant , @xmath66 , from @xmath57 . i.e. , @xmath67 where @xmath68    to use this technique , we must not sample @xmath43 where @xmath69 , or else we will end up specifying a mask with @xmath70 . specifically , @xmath71 must be greater than some minimum value , @xmath72 , given by the condition that @xmath73 .",
    "we may symmetrize the mask if we desire by forming a combination such as @xmath74 , or @xmath75 where for @xmath76 , @xmath77 has been substituted for @xmath54 .",
    "the latter combination has twice the bandwidth of the former .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a tophat function , @xmath81 then @xmath82 , and our sampling algorithm generates a mask resembling a histogram plot . a graded version of this mask would consist of stripes of different uniform shadings .",
    "choosing @xmath83 will generate a striped mask whose darkest stripe is perfectly opaque .",
    "choosing @xmath84 will generate a striped mask which never becomes perfectly opaque , a potentially useful trick since fabricating graded masks with high optical densities can be a challenge @xcite .    if @xmath85 , then equation  [ eq : m0 ] tells us that for this mask , @xmath86 , and @xmath72 is given by the condition @xmath87 .",
    "the trick probably only works for the @xmath5 mask when @xmath88 , since @xmath5 has so many zeros .",
    "table 1 lists @xmath66 and @xmath72 for several other masks , given a tophat kernel .",
    ".sampled mask parameters for @xmath79 [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table1 ]    figure  [ fig : linearmasks ] shows five examples of notch filter masks all of which are different versions of the same basic @xmath9 mask . figure  [ fig : linearmasks]a is a simple band - limited mask with no additional high - frequency components .",
    "figure  [ fig : linearmasks]b shows a version of this mask sampled as described above with a tophat kernel of width @xmath7 .",
    "this kernel is the narrowest one that works with @xmath89 ; narrower kernels require finer samplings .",
    "in two dimensions , we can use the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the high - frequency terms in a notch filter function to generate a completely binary mask , i.e. , a mask which everywhere satisfies @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "such a mask can be constructed entirely out of material which is highly opaque , like metal foil .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 the fourier transform of this convolution is a product : @xmath94 at low and mid - spatial frequencies , only the @xmath95 term contributes , and @xmath96    though @xmath97 in some places , it is possible to multiply @xmath48 by a positive real constant , less than 1 , to allow for a mask substrate that is not perfectly transparent or reflective , or to guarantee that the metal strips maintain at least a minimum width , at a small cost in throughput .",
    "if we use a sampled mask function for @xmath48 , the binary mask may be constructed entirely from opaque rectangles of varying lengths , for example , generating a `` manhattan '' pattern for simple nanofabrication .",
    "figures  [ fig : linearmasks]c , d and e show examples of binary masks which mimic the @xmath9 mask .",
    "figures  [ fig : linearmasks]d and e are binary sampled masks .",
    "we recommend using a linear mask for the following reasons : 1 ) linear masks have bandwidth in one direction only , so they generally have the best throughput .",
    "2 ) if one region of the mask deteriorates , the mask may simply be translated so that the starlight falls on a new region .",
    "3 ) errors in the uniformity of the wavefront in the direction perpendicular to the image mask cancel out in the lyot plane ; for example , the telescope need only be pointed accurately in one direction .",
    "4 ) it may be possible to use a carefully oriented linear mask to block the light from a binary star .",
    "however , circularly symmetric image masks can provide slightly more search area than linear image masks , so we discuss them here .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialmasks]a shows the center of a graded band - limited mask of the form @xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialmasks]b shows a sampled version of this mask , where , necessarily , the sampling has been performed in two - dimensions .",
    "creating this sampled mask requires following the same procedure illustrated in section  [ sec : sampling ] to guarantee that the mask satisfies equation  [ eq : cancellation ] .",
    "the sample points are shifted by a fraction of @xmath7 in some direction , and a constant is subtracted from the mask amplitude transmissivity .",
    "we can also replace an azimuthally symmetric transmission function , @xmath99 , with a discrete k - fold symmetric `` star '' mask .",
    "first , choose a 1-dimensional band - limited function , @xmath100 or a notch filter version , @xmath101 .",
    "then let @xmath102 the fourier transform of this function ( see , e.g. , jackson ( 1975 ) , p131 [ problem 3.14 ] ) is @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the radial and angular polar coordinates in the pupil plane , and @xmath106 is the bessel function of order @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialmasks]c shows an example of such a binary star mask .    for a truely band - limited mask",
    ", the radial integrals in equation  [ eq : starmaskft ] should be evaluated over a range from 0 to infinity . however , as @xcite discussed , a mask truncated at a radius of say , @xmath108 , can serve more than adequately as an approximation to a band - limited mask .",
    "moreover , the mask illumination falls off rapidly with @xmath109 , so deviations from an ideal mask are inconsequential outside some radius @xmath110 , which is likely to be much less than @xmath111 .",
    "if we consider the mask to be truncated at @xmath112 , the high frequency terms are significant only for high @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath113 for @xmath114 , the higher order terms must have absolute values less than @xmath115 inside the pupil ( @xmath116 ) ; with enough points in the star , these terms are all small .",
    "for example , if @xmath117 , @xmath118 will be less than @xmath119 interior to the lyot stop for @xmath120 ; this level suffices to allow a coronagraph to suppress the intensity of an on - axis source in the final image plane by a factor of @xmath121 .      in general , the product of two notch filter mask functions is not a notch filter mask function .",
    "however , all of the examples of notch filter mask functions discussed in this paper  except for the circular masks  have periodic fourier transforms .",
    "the product of two such functions is another periodic notch filter function .",
    "for example , one notch filter mask is @xmath122 in such a product , the bandwidths of the component masks add in each direction separately .    one may also produce a notch filter mask by combining the complements of periodic notch filter masks .",
    "for example , @xmath123 figure  [ fig : spotmask ] shows a close up of a mask with amplitude transmissivity @xmath124 , and a binary notch - filter version of this mask created by combining the complements of two mask functions of the form @xmath125 . this band - limited mask has a search area which closely resembles that of a common mask which is not band - limited  the gaussian spot .",
    "this mask and the one in equation  [ eq : maskproduct ] have bandwidth in both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .    as a third example",
    ", we can combine masks with sampled versions of the uniform mask , @xmath126 , a constant .",
    "let    @xmath127    where @xmath128 .",
    "we can multiply a notch filter mask function by @xmath129 and obtain another notch filter mask .",
    "if we choose @xmath89 , and @xmath130 , then the new mask will look just like the old one , only painted with black stripes of width @xmath131 , spaced by @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : linearmasks]e ) , which may run in any direction .",
    "since @xmath129 diffracts some light outside the lyot stop , the intensity throughput of this new @xmath48 will be reduced  by a factor of @xmath132 .",
    "combining binary masks and these striped masks may make it possible to design a range of masks which require no supportive substrate .",
    "consider a binary mask like the one shown in figure  [ fig : linearmasks]d , constructed from rectangles of opaque material , of width @xmath7 .",
    "how sensitive is the coronagraph to errors in the construction of this mask ?",
    "what if one of these rectangles , in the center of the mask , were accidentally made too short by an amount @xmath133 , where @xmath134 ?    a missing rectangle of material  or an extra rectangle of material  would act like a tophat mask , diffracting light around the second pupil plane .",
    "a tophat mask is not band - limited and it has a power spectrum that falls off quite slowly with spatial frequency .",
    "therefore it affords only modest cancellation of light in the center of the second pupil plane .    a tophat mask of width @xmath7 and length @xmath133 produces a diffraction pattern with most of its power in a zone with dimensions @xmath135 by @xmath136 .",
    "the intensity in this illuminated region is proportional to @xmath137 , but only a fraction @xmath138 of the illuminated region falls in the center of the lyot stop . in this portion of the illuminated region which falls in the center of the lyot stop ,",
    "the field is roughly uniform , but attenuated by roughly a factor of 2 ; the intensity is attenuated by a factor of four .",
    "therefore , the final image will acquire an extra image of a point source in the center , with fractional intensity @xmath139 .",
    "we can easily tolerate leakages of @xmath140 of the starlight falling in the center of the final image plane .",
    "if we are to avoid leaks of greater than this magnitude , we must avoid making the rectangles too short , unless @xmath141 , or @xmath142 . for a telescope with focal ratio @xmath143 ,",
    "this tolerance becomes @xmath144 , or typically @xmath145   @xmath146 m , for @xmath147  @xmath146 m , @xmath148 .",
    "if the error is not in the center of the mask , but in the search area , we can tolerate less leakage intensity , but the light falling on the hole will be diminished in intensity by a similar amount , so the requirement on the size of the hole remains about the same .",
    "a hole far from the center , outside the search area , say at @xmath111 , need only have @xmath149 a few percent , since the wings of the stellar image that fall on it are typically four or more orders of magnitude weaker in intensity than the core of the stellar image .",
    "the tolerances for binary mask construction given here fall within the reach of standard nanofabrication techniques .",
    "mask defects acquired during a mission may yield to compensation by the active optics a planet - finding coronagraph will require to correct wavefront errors throughout the system . if the hole in the mask described above had dimensions @xmath7 by @xmath7 , but had an intensity depth of only @xmath143 , then the hole would cause a fractional stellar leakage of @xmath150 , as opposed to @xmath139 ; the shapes of binary masks are much less sensitive to errors than the intensity transmissivities of graded masks .",
    "to further illustrate the use of a notch - filter mask , let us design some notch filter masks for a circular 4 m tpf coronagraph ( see , e.g. , brown et al .",
    "we will assume a bandpass from @xmath151  @xmath146 m to @xmath152  @xmath146 m , and a mask construction tolerance of 20 nm .",
    "rather than describing the optics in terms of the dimensionless diffraction scale , @xmath7 , we will use the phisical size of the diffraction scale in the focal plane , @xmath153 , where @xmath143 is the focal ratio of the telescope . the search problem and the characterization problem call for different specialized image masks , based on different band - limited functions .",
    "we will design a search mask  a linear mask rather than a circular mask for the reasons enumerated in section  [ sec : circular ] .",
    "if we choose a lyot stop that works at @xmath154 , the coronagraph will provide equal or better contrast over the whole band .",
    "the half power point of the mask , @xmath155 , is angle from the optical axis where @xmath156 ; we will choose @xmath157 or 150  mas .",
    "this mask will enable us to search for planets as close as @xmath158 au projected distance from a star at 6.5 parsecs .",
    "searching for planets calls for a mask based on a band - limited function with small wings , providing a large search area where the planet image will be relatively unattenuated by the mask . a suitable one with the prescribed half - power point",
    "has the form @xmath159 with @xmath160 at @xmath154 , i.e. , @xmath161 .",
    "since the primary is circular , the shape of the lyot stop will be the overlap region of two unit circles whose centers are separated by @xmath13 , as depicted in figure  4d of @xcite .    to estimate the stellar leak due to pointing error and the finite size of the stellar disk , we may re - write equation  16 in @xcite so that it applies to any linear mask which is roughly quartic inside its half - power point .",
    "the fraction of the starlight that leaks through the mask , @xmath162 , is @xmath163 % l={1 \\over { 1026 \\ \\theta_{1/2 } } } \\left[\\theta_{\\star}^4 % + 48 ( \\delta \\theta_x)^2 \\theta_{\\star}^2 % + 128 ( \\delta \\theta_x)^4 \\right ] l \\approx { { \\theta_{\\star}^4 + 48 ( \\delta \\theta)^2 \\theta_{\\star}^2 + 128 ( \\delta \\theta)^4 } \\over { 129 \\ \\theta_{1/2}^4}},\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is the angular diameter of the star , @xmath165 is the pointing error in the @xmath16 direction , and is the half power point of the mask .",
    "this equation also applies to nulling interferometers with quartic nulls .",
    "however , the half power point of a nulling interferometer s fringe depends on wavelength .",
    "when the pointing error is somewhat larger than the typical stellar diameter ( @xmath166  mas for a g star at 6.5 pc ) , the pointing error dominates the leak .",
    "if the pointing errors , @xmath165 , are distributed in a gaussian distribution about @xmath167 , the mean pointing - error - dominated leak is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "if we require a mean leakage of @xmath170 of the starlight falling in the center of the final image , the pointing error tolerance becomes @xmath171 , or 1.5  mas .",
    "this leakage due to pointing error can easily be suppressed to the @xmath121 level in the search area given a weakly apodized lyot stop .",
    "for example , an apodization function of the form @xmath172 provides 2.5 orders of magnitude of suppression at @xmath173 .",
    "the total throughput of the coronagraph would be @xmath174 without the lyot stop apodization ; with the apodization realized as a binary mask , it is 0.358 .",
    "this apodization is workable , but not optimal ; further work on choosing matched pupil and image stops could improve the overall system performance .",
    "clearly , the leakage due to pointing errors quickly shrinks for planet - finding coronagraphs with larger inner working distances , like the proposed eclipse mission @xcite . for this 2  m class telescope with inner working distance @xmath175 mas , a pointing error of",
    "@xmath176  mas suffices to match the above performance .",
    "likewise , if the pointing errors and other low - spatial - frequency errors could be controlled below the levels assumed here , these coronagraph designs could operate at smaller inner working distances",
    ".    we will realize the mask as a binary notch filter mask like the one in figure  [ fig : linearmasks]d . in section  [ sec :",
    "errors ] , we showed that the lengths of the bars in this mask must be accurate to @xmath144 . since a hole of a given physical size subtends a larger fraction of @xmath7 at smaller @xmath30 , this tolerance applies at @xmath177 . in other words , if we can manufacture a mask accurate to 20  nm , we require a focal ratio @xmath178 .",
    "the strips must have maximum width @xmath179 m .",
    "explicitly , the mask function would be : @xmath180 where @xmath181 table  1 shows that our mask has @xmath182 and @xmath183 .    in the absence of noise , analyzing the data from this coronagraph is trivial .",
    "a planet at angle @xmath184 from the optical axis is simply attenuated by the low spatial frequency components of the notch filter mask , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "the shape of the psf is set entirely by the lyot stop ; it is the squared absolute value of fourier conjugate of the lyot stop amplitude transmissivity .",
    "we numerically simulated the performance of this notch - filter coronagraph design by following the fraunhofer propagation of light through a coronagraph using fast fourier transforms .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have used this technique to model the performance of ground - based coronagraphs .",
    "we simulated the broad - band performance by running the monochromatic simulation 10 times over a range of wavelengths from 0.66 to 1.0  @xmath146 m and averaged the output images weighted by the stellar flux , assuming a rayleigh - jeans law star and planet .",
    "the noise representations remained the same from wavelength to wavelength  scaled appropriately to model pathlength errors rather than phase errors and to reflect the change in the diffraction scale .",
    "we used a 1024 by 1024 grid with resolution @xmath186 . in this representation , errors in the shape of the image mask become variations in the mask amplitude transmissivity .",
    "for example , if a bar in the binary mask were too long by @xmath133 , the values of four adjacent elements in the mask amplitude transmissivity matrix would increase by @xmath137 .",
    "we assumed a circular pupil and a lyot stop with the shape of two overlapping circles as described above multiplied by @xmath187 .",
    "seen from afar , the contrast between the earth and the sun when the earth is at maximum angular separation is @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "we used this contrast level for the planets in our simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : pupilplane ] shows the intensity in the second pupil plane before ( a ) and after ( b ) the lyot stop for a monochromatic simulation at 1.0  @xmath146 m of a system containing a star and a planet at @xmath189 .",
    "the intensity after the lyot stop has been multiplied by a factor of @xmath190 .",
    "this figure represents a more accurate version of the cartoon in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : pupilplane]a shows how the diffracted light falls within regions of width @xmath13 around the left and right edges of the lyot stop .",
    "the notch filter mask adds further illumination to the lyot stop , farther off axis .",
    "our simulation does not model these artifacts ; the lyot stop blocks them completely .",
    "the planet adds a uniform background illumination to the region inside the lyot stop , though the noise peaks due to wavefront errors and mask errors dominate figure  [ fig : pupilplane]b .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulation ] shows a cut through the final image plane along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows a plot of @xmath191 .",
    "this quantity is the intensity attenuation supplied by the coronagraph , neglecting any modification of the low spatial frequency components of the mask that might occur in the construction of a notch filter representation .",
    "the lower panel of the figure shows the relative surface brightness of several noise contributions to the image , normalized to the peak of what the stellar image would be if the image mask were removed .",
    "the dotted curve shows the @xmath192 leakage due to pointing error which we prescribed .",
    "the form of this curve is simply the fourier transform of the lyot stop averaged over the band weighted by the stellar flux .",
    "the dash - dot curve shows the consequence of adding white noise to the lengths of the bars with r.m.s .",
    "this noise concentrates near the optical axis in the final image plane because it is multiplied by the image of the star that falls on the image mask .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that the tolerance of the coronagraph to mask errors can be altered , and possibly improved by manipulating the shape of the entrance pupil .",
    "the solid black curve shows the consequence of adding white - noise phase and amplitude errors to the incoming wavefront : fractional amplitude errors of r.m.s . @xmath193 over spatial frequencies corresponding to the search area in the image plane ( 360 @xmath7 ) and phase errors due to pathlength errors of r.m.s 0.5  over these frequencies .",
    "a pathlength error of 0.5   corresponds to an error in the figure of a mirror of 0.25  .",
    "preliminary tests in the high contrast imaging testbed at jpl have demonstrated deformable mirror wavefront control at this level @xcite .",
    "wavefront errors clearly dominate mask errors and pointing errors , except within a few diffraction widths of the optical axis .",
    "the grey curves show the images of two planets located at @xmath194 and @xmath189 , i.e. , 154 mas and 1026 mas  or 0.8  au and 5.1  au for a star 5 pc distant .",
    "the planet at @xmath194 is attenuated by a factor of @xmath195 because it sits at the mask s half power point .",
    "if @xmath196 is the contrast between the planet s peak intensity and the local scattered light background @xcite , the @xmath173 planet has @xmath197 , and the @xmath198 planet has @xmath199 .",
    "planets with @xmath200 can easily be detected in a coronagraph using spectral deconvolution techniques , for example , given sufficiently low photon noise @xcite .",
    "we have illustrated the use of notch filter functions to generate several kinds of image masks which should be relatively easy to manufacture .",
    "we showed graded masks whose transmissivities are everywhere greater than zero .",
    "we showed binary image masks , which can be cut or shaped from pieces of opaque material .",
    "these binary masks can be manufactured to the tolerances necessary for terrestrial planet finding using standard nanofabrication techniques , and can potentially be made self - supporting .",
    "our simulations of the performance of a coronagraph outfitted with a binary notch filter mask suggest that this technique could reveal extrasolar planets similar in brightness to the earth around nearby stars , given foreseeable improvements in wavefront control on a highly stable space platform .",
    "binary notch filter masks combine many of the advantages of binary pupil masks ( ease of manufacture , achromaticity , robustness ) with the advantages of band - limited image masks ( large search area , and small inner working distance ) .",
    "using binary pupil or image masks seems to inevitably require stacking many copies of the same basic aperture shape ; @xcite used this principle to generate binary pupil masks ; we have used it to generate binary image masks . in @xcite ,",
    "the high - spatial frequency artifacts of this stacking procedure appear in the image plane directed away from a search sector . in notch",
    "filter masks , the high - spatial frequency artifacts are directed into the lyot stop .",
    "ultimately , a space telescope for direct optical imaging of extrasolar planets may incorporate more than one diffracted - light management strategy . having a choice of different techniques available will allow a mission to adapt to changing observing needs as our understanding of high - contrast space telescopes improves and the phenomenology of extrasolar planets unfolds .",
