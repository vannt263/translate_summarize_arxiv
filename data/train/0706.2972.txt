    "the initial state radiation @xmath11 in electron - positron machines is being used to study electron - positron annihilation into hadronic states @xmath12 , scanning energies below the original design in the so - called radiative return method .",
    "this method has proved to be useful both in the study of the properties of low lying resonances in @xmath13 factories @xcite as well as in the measurement of the cross section for electron - positron annihilation into different hadronic final states in @xmath14 factories @xcite . in the latter case it is possible to study electron - positron annihilation into hadronic states over the range from @xmath15 up to @xmath16 with a clean identification of the desired final states over the hadronic background .",
    "detailed analysis of some of these processes show enhancements of the corresponding cross sections whose proper description seems to require the existence of new resonances .",
    "indeed , a broad structure was found in the @xmath17 cross section showing the existence of a resonance with a mass of about @xmath18 bby .",
    "more recently , in studying the cross section as a function of the center of mass for @xmath19 with the dipion mass close to the @xmath20 another structure was found around @xmath21 indicating the existence of a new resonance with a mass of about @xmath22 and a width of @xmath23 @xcite .    for final pions in a @xmath24 even state ,",
    "the leading electromagnetic contributions to the @xmath25 process come from the exchange of a virtual photon .",
    "the quark lines of the @xmath13 and @xmath26 final states are disconnected thus at tree level the @xmath27 can only be induced by sequential decays like @xmath28 which are suppressed by the small @xmath29 mixing .",
    "we explored this possibility finding this contribution rather small .",
    "the natural mechanisms appear at one loop level .",
    "in particular for a dipion mass close to the @xmath30 this process involves the @xmath31 vertex function with a photon with a virtuality above @xmath32 .",
    "the very same vertex function appears also in one of the mechanisms ( dominant in the case of neutral pions ) for the radiative decay @xmath33 recently measured in electron - positron @xmath13 factories @xcite but there photons are on - shell .",
    "the vertex function at @xmath34 , the @xmath35 coupling , appearing in these decays is an important piece in the elucidation of the structure of the lowest lying scalar nonet .",
    "the @xmath36 decays have been studied in effective models for non - perturbative qcd @xcite incorporating scalar degrees of freedom and in unitarized chiral perturbation theory @xcite ( see also applications to @xmath37 in @xcite ) . in both formalisms ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by the chain @xmath38 where the @xmath39 decay is induced at one loop level through charged kaon loops which couple to the explicit scalar fields in the former case or generate them dynamically through @xmath2 rescattering in the latter case .",
    "the very same dynamics must be at work in the case of virtual photons and should be the dominant one for low photon virtualities .",
    "the calculation of such effects is the subject of this paper .    unlike the case of the @xmath40 @xmath41 decay where the real photon tests only the electric charge , here we have a highly virtual photon which couples to higher multipoles and",
    "the way to incorporate systematically the effects of kaon loops is to consider the full kaon form factor @xmath42 in the @xmath43 interaction .",
    "furthermore , although the contribution of neutral kaons vanishes for real photons , in the case of virtual photons the @xmath44 coupling is not null and we must consider also neutral kaon loops with the corresponding form factor .",
    "the challenge here is the proper characterization of the kaon form factor at the energy of the reaction .",
    "fortunately we have at our disposal both a theoretical calculation of the neutral and charged kaon form factors in @xmath45 @xcite and direct measurements @xcite in the energy region of interest . in the former case , the kaon form factor is matched with the perturbative qcd predictions at high energy and to @xmath46 at low energy and , although the calculated form factor can not account for the effects of excited vector mesons lying around @xmath47 @xmath48 , it is in agreement with the scarce experimental data above @xmath49 @xmath48 .",
    "concerning the @xmath50 scattering , it remains in the same energy range as in @xmath51 decays and we can safely use the amplitudes calculated in unitarized chiral perturbation theory which contains naturally the scalar poles .",
    "the high virtuality of the exchanged photon makes probable the excitation of higher mass hadronic states .",
    "the quark structure of the @xmath13 suggests that the @xmath5 intermediate state can also give important contributions to @xmath52 via the production of virtual @xmath53 , with the virtual @xmath54 decaying into a @xmath13 @xmath55 and the final rescattering of kaons into pions . in this concern",
    "it is worth mentioning that experimental data on @xmath56 at @xmath57 @xmath58 shows that this reaction is dominated by intermediate neutral @xmath59 production with the @xmath60 decaying into @xmath61@xcite , hence there is a sizable coupling of a virtual photon to the @xmath5 system at the mentioned energies .",
    "the proper description of this mechanism requires the knowledge of the transition @xmath5 electromagnetic form factor but , again , it can be extracted from experimental data on @xmath62 which shows that , in addition to the contributions from the exchange of lowest lying vectors , this form factor receives also contributions from the exchange of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . remarkably there is no evidence for contributions coming from the exchange of @xmath65 to this form factor .    in this paper",
    "we study the above mentioned mechanisms for @xmath52 for the dipion system in an isoscalar @xmath66wave .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we calculate the @xmath67 vertex function using @xmath45 . in section iii",
    "we calculate intermediate vector meson contributions using @xmath45 supplemented with the anomalous term describing @xmath4 interactions and incorporate contributions from heavy mesons to the @xmath5 transition form factor . in section iv we analyze the different contributions and our summary and conclusions are given in section v.",
    "following @xcite , the process @xmath25 is induced at one loop level by the kaon loops . in the calculations",
    "the vertices are borrowed from resonance chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "we follow the conventions in @xcite and the relevant interactions in their notation are@xmath70 where @xmath71 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduce the photon field through @xmath72  and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) where @xmath75denotes the electromagnetic strenght tensor . for further details in the notation",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fd ] ) , where for simplicity a shaded circle and a dark circle account for the diagrams @xmath76 plus @xmath77 and @xmath78 plus @xmath79 respectively , which differentiate the direct photon coupling from the coupling through an intermediate vector meson .",
    "we will address the corresponding diagrams as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , when we have the direct photon coupling and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , when the coupling goes through the exchange of a vector meson .",
    "the kaon form factor at lowest order contains the exchange of vector mesons in diagrams @xmath84 which in @xmath1 are intrinsically gauge invariant .",
    "one interesting feature of the use of meson - meson chiral amplitudes is that in the different processes one can factorize the amplitude on - shell inside the loops .",
    "this is the case in the construction of the unitary meson - meson amplitudes where the factorization can be seen as a consequence of the reabsorption of the off - shell terms into renormalization of elementary couplings @xcite , or using the @xmath85 method of unitarization that relies upon the imaginary part of the amplitudes which involves the on - shell part @xcite .",
    "these two methods have been generalized to the case of meson - baryon interaction in @xcite and @xcite respectively . more concretely , for the case close to ours in @xmath86 it was demonstrated , using arguments of gauge invariance , that only the on - shell part of the meson - meson amplitudes was needed inside the loops @xcite .",
    "explicit cancellation of the off - shell terms can be seen in our formalism and we only sketch the derivation since there are basic principles that tells us this factorization should always be possible .",
    "the reason is that the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude is unphysical and can be changed with a unitary transformation of the fields , that , however , should not change the physical amplitudes .",
    "technically the cancellations in our formalism go as follows . as discussed in @xcite , to lowest order in the chiral expansion the @xmath2 amplitude ( denoted by @xmath87 ) for arbitrary values of the particle momenta @xmath88 has the form@xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the on - shell amplitude . in the following we use the convention",
    "that all external particle momenta of the @xmath91 vertex function flow into the vertices and will change this direction only in the numerical results . considering the off - shell part of the meson - meson interaction in diagrams @xmath92 , @xmath81 , associated to the line of momentum",
    "@xmath93 cancels the corresponding meson propagator and generates a topological structure like the one of diagram @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , diagram @xmath94 is a genuine diagram that can be calculated by using the lagrangian @xmath95 of eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) expanded to four mesons .",
    "when this is done one finds an exact cancellation of the off - shell terms against diagram @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are similar cancellations between the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude associated to the line with momentum @xmath96 in diagrams @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath97 with the genuine contributions in diagrams @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "a remnant contribution appears after the cancellations , which vanishes for real photons and involves derivatives in the vector fields .",
    "exact cancellation of this part would require the introduction of counterterm lagrangians involving derivatives of @xmath100 and @xmath101 and such lagrangians are sometimes used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "finally the off - shell part of diagram @xmath102 which involve charged kaons only cancels exactly diagram @xmath103 with charged kaons in the loops .",
    "remaining tadpole contributions from neutral kaons can be cancelled by appropriate counterterms . in summary",
    ", all one has to do is to evaluate the diagrams @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath97 , and @xmath102 with the meson - meson amplitudes factorized on - shell and omiting the rest of diagrams .",
    "this lowest order amplitude is iterated in the coupled channel framework used in @xcite to obtain the unitarized @xmath104 amplitudes which contain the scalar poles . in a coming section",
    "we will study the contributions of loops involving vector meson propagators .",
    "in this case we do not have enough information on the higher order lagrangians to explicitly show the cancellations but we shall equally assume that the meson - meson amplitude can be factorized on - shell out of the loops .",

    "the description of the peaks of @xmath6 around the @xmath30 resonance , as well as the agreement with data on total cross sections ( up to the signal of the new resonance ) , without the explicit introduction of the @xmath30 state , provides extra support for the @xmath30 as being dynamically generated from the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons in coupled channels .",
