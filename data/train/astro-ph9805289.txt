    "space - based observatories such as _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , _ beppo - sax _ and the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ , and ground - based air cherenkov telescopes such as the _ whipple observatory _ and _ hegra _ , have gathered data from blazars and grbs of sufficient quality to allow combined temporal and spectral analyses .",
    "a general trend is becoming apparent in blazar studies ( see wagner 1997 and shrader & wehrle 1997 for reviews ) : variability of optical and @xmath8 mev emission in flat spectrum sources such as 3c 279 ( e.g. , hartman et al . 1996 ) and bl lacertae ( bloom et al .",
    "1997 ) , and of x - ray and tev emission in the bl lac objects mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( e.g. , macomb et al . 1995 ; buckley et al . 1996",
    "; catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) appears to be temporally correlated , implying that the same population of electrons produces both the optical / x - ray and the 100 mev - tev emission . in the specific case of the 1994 may flare of mrk 421 , _ asca _ observations ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ) also show that the time lag of photons in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev range relative to 5 kev x - rays varies as @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the mrk 421 flare data follow a well - defined trajectory in a spectral index / flux display , and this behavior is also found in several other bl lac objects ( e.g. , oj 287 , idesawa et al . 1997 ; pks 2155 - 304 , sembay et al .",
    "1993 )    recent analyses of grb data show that the light curves tend to become narrower at higher energies ( fishman et al .",
    "1992 ) , and that the decaying phases of grb light curves are generally longer than the rising phases ( link , epstein , & priedhorsky 1993 ) .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the autocorrelation function of 45 bright batse grbs , aligned at their peak fluxes , displays an energy dependent width @xmath10 . in the specific case of grb 960720 , which displays a single well - defined pulse , an energy - dependent duration @xmath11 is found ( piro et al .",
    "1998 ) .    the radio / optical continuum of blazars is thought to be",
    "nonthermal synchrotron radiation , and blast wave models of grbs also indicate that the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray continuum from grbs is produced by the same process ( e.g. , mszros , rees , & papathanassiou 1994 ; tavani 1996 ; waxman 1997 ; vietri 1997 ) .",
    "the origin of the high energy gamma - ray emission in blazars is generally thought to originate from compton processes , though it remains unclear whether internal synchrotron photons or photons produced outside the jet represent the dominant soft photon source .",
    "the high - energy radiation from grbs might also originate from compton - scattering processes ( see , e.g. , hurley et al .",
    "1994 ; mszros et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the likelihood that synchrotron emission from cooling nonthermal electrons can explain some of the previously mentioned trends has been discussed in various approximations ( e.g. , tashiro et al . 1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ; tavani 1996 ; kazanas , titarchuk , & hua 1998 ; kirk , rieger , & mastichiadis 1998 ) , but without a consideration of the associated ssc emission and a full treatment of the relativistic boost and energy normalization for the injected nonthermal electrons .    in this _",
    ", we analyze the simplest possible model that retains the essential physics of nonthermal electron injection and cooling in relativistic plasma outflows .",
    "even so , it goes a long way towards explaining the observed trends , and in addition suggests a fruitful avenue of research which could help to discriminate between models of high - energy blazar emission , to determine the origin of the high - energy radiation in grbs , and to strengthen a new beaming test for blazar radiation ( catanese et al .",
    "assume that nonthermal electrons with lorentz factors @xmath12 are injected uniformly throughout a spherical emission region with radius @xmath13 , and that the electron injection spectrum maintains a constant amplitude and power - law form with injection index @xmath14 between comoving times @xmath15 .",
    "note that causality restricts @xmath0 to be no shorter than @xmath16 , though the injection duration could be much longer if the time scale @xmath0 is set by some intrinsic process which energizes the nonthermal electrons on a longer time scale .",
    "if the total energy injected in nonthermal electrons during the injection event is @xmath17(ergs ) , then the injection function at time @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where the heaviside function @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is readily generalized to time - varying injection events and , given some work , to cases where the injection occurs nonuniformly throughout the volume of the plasmoid .",

    "it is straightforward to generalize equation ( 2 ) for particle escape ( see tashiro et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we also assume that there is a separation between the acceleration / injection and cooling processes .",
    "this separation holds when the cooling time scale is much longer than the acceleration time scale , but can limit the highest energies to which electrons are accelerated during the main portion of a flare , as shown by kirk et al .",
    "particle acceleration can also influence spectral and temporal evolution long after the main flaring behavior has ended , though its effect is probably negligible if the flares exhibit sharply defined pulses which return to their quiescent levels at high energies .",

    "equation ( 3 ) is valid for radiation which is emitted isotropically in the comoving frame , and applies to synchrotron and ssc processes ( see reynolds 1991 and dermer 1995 for cases where this does not hold ) . the expressions @xmath51 and",

    "a self - consistent treatment of plasmoid dynamics when the inertia of external matter swept up by the plasmoid can not be neglected has been treated by chiang & dermer ( 1998 ) .    in the @xmath58-function approximation for synchrotron emission , which is a good approximation away from the cutoffs of the synchrotron spectrum produced by the endpoints of the electron distribution , we have @xmath59\\;\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] ( e.g. , dermer , sturner , & schlickeiser 1997 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) , moreover , it is noted that correlated x - ray / tev data imply an upper limit on @xmath23 because the electrons producing the highest energy synchrotron emission have lorentz factors @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the measured energy in tev of the highest - energy gamma - rays .",
    "synchrotron emission correlated with the tev flux requires that the electrons radiate in a magnetic field at least as great as @xmath94 $ ] , where @xmath95 is the measured dimensionless energy of the highest energy synchrotron photons produced by the electrons which produce the tev radiation .",
    "when compared with the value of @xmath23 inferred through equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we obtain an expression for the doppler factor , given by    @xmath96^{3/2}\\over \\bar \\epsilon_{\\rm obs}^{1/4}({\\rm kev } ) ( \\delta \\to^{\\rm min})^{1/2}(\\epsilon_{\\rm obs , syn})^{3/4}}\\;.\\eqno(11)\\ ] ] a lower limit to @xmath97 is obtained if the tev flux does not exhibit a clear cutoff due to the high - energy cutoff in the the electron distribution function .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "1a shows the energy dependence of the mean time @xmath98 for the synchrotron and ssc processes . as can be seen by examining fig .",
    "1b , the ssc emission decays more slowly than the synchrotron process , yielding an energy dependence @xmath99 until the shortest mean time @xmath100 is reached , which occurs at much higher energies than for the synchrotron process .",
    "thomson scattering of external photons , having an energy loss rate of the same form as the synchrotron energy loss rate , also gives @xmath101 for @xmath62 .",
    "when more sensitive blazar @xmath37-ray observations become available with the upcoming @xmath102 and @xmath103 missions , the energy - dependence of the mean time or duration of blazar flares can be used to determine whether ssc or ecs processes dominate in specific sources or between different source classes .",
    "this test might also be possible for bright tev flares from bl lac objects given the steadily improving sensitivity of air cherenkov telescopes .",
    "more detailed studies need to be performed which take into account klein - nishina effects and general values of @xmath14 .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum at different observing times , using the same parameters as in figure 1 . at a fixed photon energy ,",
    "the flux rises due to the accumulation of injected nonthermal electrons until cooling plays an important role in depleting the electron spectrum ( cf . dermer & chiang 1998 ) .",
    "the effects of cooling are seen earliest at the highest photon energies , and cause a softening of the spectrum .",
    "consequently , the spectral flux at a given photon energy displays a hard spectrum while its intensity is increasing , since the electrons that are radiating this emission have not yet felt the effects of cooling .",
    "when synchrotron cooling becomes important , the flux begins to fall rapidly .",
    "this behavior is shown by the solid curve ( 1 ) in the inset to figure 2 , which displays the clockwise evolution of the 2 - 10 kev spectral index as a function of a quantity proportional to the 2 kev spectral flux . in reality",
    ", there will be some level of background which will be reached .",
    "this is crudely modeled here by adding an underlying spectral component with spectral flux @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 ergs @xmath41 for the dashed curve ( 2 ) and dotted curve ( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "the behavior illustrated in the inset to fig .",
    "2 is in qualitative agreement with evolutionary tracks of the spectral index / flux observed from some blazars , as noted in the introduction ( see also kirk et al .",
    "precise fitting of such tracks will require extending this model for general injection indices and for various forms for the background emission .",
    "the well - known hard - to - soft evolution of grb pulses ( e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1986 ) could be a manifestation of this effect , and the approach outlined here can also be used to analyze the fluence dependence of the peak of the grb @xmath107 spectrum ( liang & kargatis 1996 ) .    in summary ,",
    "a very simple model has been presented for the observed nonthermal synchrotron and ssc emission emitted by cooling nonthermal electrons which are injected over a comoving time interval @xmath0 into plasma with relativistic bulk motion . in spite of the model s simplicity , empirical trends that have become better defined through recent combined temporal and spectral analyses of data from blazars and grbs",
