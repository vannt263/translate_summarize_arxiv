    "one hope in building the so called meson factories towards the end of the 70 s was to use mesons , in these facilities pions , as probes of nuclear wave functions and nuclear structure at short distances @xcite .",
    "however , on the theoretical side it soon turned out that meson interactions even with the two - nucleon systems were quite a challenge and most work concerned these @xcite .",
    "pion production physics obtained a new surge with the advent of a new generation of accelerators at iucf , celsius and cosy with a very high energy resolution making possible accurate measurements at meson thresholds @xcite .",
    "new and even unexpected results also created renewed theoretical activity , concentrated still mainly on two - nucleon meson production at threshold and also at higher energies to understand some puzzles e.g. in @xmath2 threshold production @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there has emerged a general consensus of a fair understanding of at least the main mechanisms in the two - nucleon system , although some problems still remain  within the conventional ( meson - exchange ) approach @xcite as well as in the chiral perturbation treatment of pion production and absorption @xcite .",
    "new experiments are also performed or in progress on meson production in few - nucleon systems as in @xmath3 @xmath4he@xmath5 or @xmath3 @xmath4h@xmath6 @xcite as well as corresponding @xmath7 meson production experiments @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical efforts in this direction with three - nucleon dynamics are very scarce @xcite and the situation is much less satisfactory as compared with the two - nucleon case .",
    "nevertheless , pionic inelasticities in 3- or 4-nucleon systems should be the necessary bridge towards understanding them in nuclei and potentially using them as a probe in many - body nuclear physics and for possible effects of nuclear medium on hadrons and their interactions .",
    "one may also note that in these phenomena some reaction channels are actually only accessible in absorption .    at the above mentioned new facilities pion absorption experiments are unlikely due to their low intensities .",
    "however , absorption is closely related to production reactions and should be understood in parallel . furthermore , it may be argued that some absorption processes might be easier to approach theoretically than production .",
    "one such process could be quasifree absorption on a pair of nucleons in @xmath0 ( or in triton ) .",
    "this is the inverse of two - nucleon pion production in the presence of a ( hopefully ) inactive spectator . here",
    "the initial state nuclear wave function is known , in principle , exactly from faddeev calculations and the final state pair is similar to those treated in two - nucleon reactions .",
    "success in this simplest case might open the door to modelling ( with explicit inclusion of the spectator ) three - nucleon absorption ( where data from psi @xcite are available ) and the break - up of @xmath0 into a deuteron and a proton  the inverse of the above referred production reactions .",
    "experimental cross sections of quasifree two - nucleon absorption of pions on helium isotopes have been obtained from the meson factories of lampf @xcite , triumf @xcite and psi @xcite , but scarce data exist also for the polarization of outcoming fast protons @xcite .",
    "these are obtained at so called conjugate angles corresponding to kinematics where it is believed that the spectator is not an active participant and does not absorb momentum from the pion . then the spectator remains essentially at rest retaining only its fermi momentum . in ref .",
    "@xcite one sees at these angles a massive peaking of the cross section , over an order of magnitude higher than for nonconjugate angles , as a function of the proton energy .",
    "the width of this peak may be accounted for with the fermi motion .",
    "the quasifree nature ( the spectator having essentially the momentum distribution of the bound state ) is even more convincingly established in the kinematically complete experiments of ref .",
    "cross sections for positive and negative pion absorption on tritium were obtained in ref .",
    "overall , this gives a good wealth of data to determine absorption on different nucleon pairs with different isospins in a simple nuclear environment .",
    "also heavier nuclei have been investigated in related contexts @xcite .",
    "theoretical work is of old vintage , the most recent serious work probably being in refs .",
    "@xcite for positive pions and @xcite for negative pions , and @xcite for branching ratios in stopped @xmath8 absorption .",
    "the angular shapes of the cross sections could be well explained and , roughly , also absolute magnitudes .",
    "in fact , for positive pions the shapes do nt differ much from @xmath9 in theory or experiment .",
    "however , in absorption of positive pions on @xmath0 or @xmath10he the polarization of the outcoming protons was found to be in qualitative disagreement with the simple theory employed @xcite , which neglected the effect of the spectator and used phenomenological range - corrected deuteron wave functions to describe the active pair as a quasideuteron .",
    "the measurements were performed at 120 and 250 mev and it was possible to reproduce the data qualitatively - however , only when applying different models for the two energies , and not with the same model for both energies .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "a simple parametrization was presented that approximates analytically exact three - nucleon bound state wave functions resulting from faddeev calculations based on realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interactions .",
    "this parametrization is similar in philosophy to that of ref .",
    "@xcite but deviates from it in two important ways .",
    "firstly , it releases its single term separability in the two relative momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the pair and the spectator ( or the corresponding coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "this gives more freedom for reproducing the behaviour of the wave function better when both momenta are large  as one would expect , for example , that one particle which is far off shell would influence the others .",
    "in contrast , the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite treats the dependence of the wave function on the two momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 as being totally independent of each other .",
    "there are actually significant differences between the wave functions at momenta relevant for mesonic inelasticities @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see what impact these may have to physically observable quantities , in particular , whether the pair - spectator correlation could correct the above mentioned energy dependent discrepancy seen in the pion absorption reactions .",
    "a second difference is that , instead of parametrizing the single faddeev amplitudes only , corresponding to different permutations of the three nucleons , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we parametrized directly partial wave projections of the total antisymmetrized wave function .",
    "also this expansion was seen to be well convergent and was applied in calculations of low - momentum quantities such as the probabilities of the trinucleon wave function components and the @xmath15he scattering length in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply this parametrization to study quasi - two - body absorption of pions on @xmath4he .",
    "thereby , the aim is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we want to test the reliability and convergence of our parametrization of the three - nucleon bound state wave function in calculations of observables involving higher momenta .",
    "secondly , we want to see how one can fare with such improved wave functions in this specific reaction physically , without explicit participation of the spectator nucleon . in the following section we shortly outline the most essential features of the parametrization and provide some details of the ingredients and technical aspects of our calculation of pion absorption , while the third section deals with the actual results of our pion absorption calculation .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks .",
    "aiming at extreme simplicity the model of ref .",
    "@xcite considered quasifree absorption of positive pions as simply absorption on a quasideuteron with a wave function more compressed than the free deuteron ( because the binding energy is larger ) and with kinematics compatible with 10 mev more binding than in the normal deuteron ( 5 mev for the actual binding energy difference _ plus _ 5 mev for the average kinetic energy of the spectator from its momentum distribution ) .",
    "a similar approach was adopted also later for negative pion absorption on a singlet proton pair @xcite and actually was able to explain such features of the differential absorption cross section as the asymmetry about @xmath16 and also of the analyzing power in the closely related process @xmath17 .",
    "the trinucleon wave functions adopted were basically of two kinds .",
    "initially , phenomenological functions based on a range - modified deuteron wave function following an old idea of ref . @xcite or on a calculated correlation function @xcite were used in ref .",
    "later also faddeev pair wave functions @xmath18 from the separable form @xmath19 parametrized by hajduk _",
    "_ @xcite were used in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath20\\rangle = \\langle r_{23}\\rho_1\\nu_{23 } |\\psi [ ( 23)1]\\rangle = \\langle r_{31}\\rho_2\\nu_{31 } |\\psi [ ( 31)2]\\rangle \\label{single}\\ ] ] and the total antisymmetric wave function is @xmath21\\rangle +    these calculations used for absorption on each pair @xmath22 only the wave function component above with the particular permutation @xmath23 and considered only the corresponding jacobian coordinate @xmath24 in the absorption process . with a single term separable parametrization @xcite or with a completely phenomenological pair wave function this left the role of the spectator to a mere normalization integral",
    "plausibly , the use of the square root of the correlation function as the pair wave function may take the other two terms in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) effectively into account to some extent .",
    "evidently , this issue will now be addressed more explicitly with the new wave functions .    in the above functions the index @xmath25 labels the partial wave structure of the three nucleons . in the following calculations",
    "we only consider the states with zero spectator orbital angular momentum , so that this index trivially just symbolizes the quantum numbers of the pair wave functions , in the singlet spin state @xmath26 and in the triplet @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the two additional states with the spectator angular momentum 2 considered in refs . @xcite have much less weight and are assumed to be of little importance for the present kinematics where the spectator remains essentially at rest .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a considerably different parameterization was given for the wave functions .",
    "firstly , the simple separability used in ref .",
    "@xcite was generalized to more terms of separable form with a systematic improvement in the approximation .",
    "the structure of the wave function remained basically simple but allowed correlation between the momenta or the corresponding coordinates , which is not present in the simple product ansatz .",
    "physically one might expect that , if in a bound three - body system either the spectator or the pair is far off - shell , then it would be less likely to find also the other far off - shell .",
    "a parameterization as a sum of two products was seen to offer sufficient freedom and to allow a reasonable fit in the sense that inclusion of a third term did not have much effect .",
    "it is worth noting that at large momenta , relevant to meson production and absorption , the inclusion of the second term changed the wave function significantly .",
    "the second essential difference is that in ref .",
    "@xcite a parameterization for the fully antisymmetrized wave function was provided , and not only for its individual faddeev amplitudes as in ref .",
    "this is a nontrivial extension , including also the two other amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) in the projection on angular momentum eigenstates , and has the advantage that all permutations enter automatically into the calculation of each pair absorption but still with simple wave functions for a given coordinate pair .",
    "e. g. if the form of eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) is used in absorption on the pair 12 , the first term is simple , but in the other terms the `` proper '' simple pair coordinate would be @xmath29 or @xmath30 . these terms would be quite complicated functions of the coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". however , once the full antisymmetric wave function is parametrized directly in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the calculation is greatly simplified .",
    "the choice of the pair does not matter , since physically absorption on any pair should give the same result , anyhow .    in practice",
    "the full antisymmetric faddeev wave function ( calculated using the cd bonn @xcite and paris @xcite potentials ) was expressed as a product of functions of the pair and spectator momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where each function is given by expansions in terms of lorentz functions @xmath35 for the five most important faddeev amplitudes . in the coordinate representation",
    "these functions will transform into yukawa functions and ( for @xmath36 waves ) their derivatives , @xmath37 with similar expressions for the ( spectator ) @xmath14 dependence .",
    "the denominator @xmath13 is cancelled against the volume element .    up to this point the procedure would have been equivalent to ref .",
    "@xcite , except that the fit was performed to the exact total ( antisymmetrized ) wave functions . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite another similar product term @xmath38 was added in order to improve the quality of the analytical representation of the wavefunction .",
    "thus the wave function was presented as @xmath39 with the normalization @xmath40 the parameters of the fit(s ) were given in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be repeated here , but the importance of the additional freedom will be studied in the differential cross section and polarization of the protons in quasifree absorption on positive pions on quasideuterons . at this stage",
    "it is worth remembering that for a specific low - momentum observable , the @xmath41he scattering length , the effect of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ twoterms ] ) was seen to be only about the order of 1% @xcite .",
    "before going into any details of the pion absorption mechanisms we want to test the significance of nonseparability anticipated above for physical reasons .",
    "therefore , we explore extreme momentum transfers corresponding to the highest energy at which polarization data in pion absorption are available , namely @xmath42 = 250 mev . our results for the differential absorption cross section on a quasideuteron and transverse polarization .",
    "in meson production this would correspond to the asymmetry of the cross section of the two - nucleon reaction with a polarized beam .",

    "( [ twoterms ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that nonseparability does play a significant role .",
    "however , it is encouraging to see that just one additional term of products is sufficient to account for it and that the expansion has converged quite well already at the two - term level . in the calculations presented in fig .",
    "[ convcross ] the faddeev wave functions from the cd bonn potential are used .",
    "we want to mention , however , that the convergence features for those based on the paris potential were found to be the same .",

    "the direct production is generalized to include also @xmath11-wave @xmath43 rescattering ( fig . [ mechs]b ) via the @xmath47 resonance .",
    "note that this contribution is treated on the same footing as the direct production by generating first the @xmath48 admixture by the coupled channels method in the initial state .",
    "subsequently the @xmath49 decays by an operator similar to eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) ( with the spin and isospin operators replaced by the @xmath48 transition operators and the @xmath50 coupling constant @xmath51 by the @xmath52 coupling constant @xmath53 from the decay width of the @xmath49 ) .",
    "this produces the well known prominent cross section peak at pion energies around 150 mev .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction of the high - energy nucleon pair is based on the reid soft core potential @xcite . at high energies the details of the potential",
    "are not expected to be very important . moreover , within a coupled channels treatment the @xmath1 part must be modified , anyway , to avoid doubly counting the attraction generated by the coupling to @xmath48 intermediate states @xcite .    at threshold , both production and absorption are , however , dominated by @xmath43 @xmath46-wave rescattering , fig .",
    "[ mechs]c , with also a substantial contribution from fig .",
    "[ mechs]d .",
    "this rescattering is described by a phenomenological @xmath43 interaction @xmath54 where the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend on the @xmath43 on - shell momentum and are fitted to pion - nucleon scattering data @xcite .",
    "as far as the relative importance in positive and negative pion absorption is concerned one should note that , due to chiral invariance , @xmath55 is suppressed close to threshold by a a factor of @xmath57 as compared with @xmath56 .",
    "indeed @xmath55 is very small at threshold , but it becomes comparable to @xmath56 for pion momenta @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath59 . a monopole form factor is included in the meson exchange interaction .",
    "the value of the cut - off mass is crucial in fitting the analyzing power @xmath60 at some given energy .",
    "its effect is small on the total cross section except close to threshold .",
    "it is known that the above mechanisms are not sufficient to explain the size of the cross section of the reaction @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the remaining strength could be explained by short - range contributions from the @xmath1 interaction to the axial charge of the two nucleons , most importantly by exchanges of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 mesons as shown in fig .",
    "[ mechs]e @xcite off - shell rescattering has been proposed @xcite .",
    "reality may be a combination of both @xcite .",
    "consequently its effect was seen to be important also in negative pion absorption on @xmath26 @xmath63 pairs in @xmath4he @xcite . in @xmath9 and the inverse reaction ( i.e. the present consideration with a quasideuteron ) the effect of the heavy meson exchange was seen to be much less important @xcite . however , in the present context the wave functions are more condensed than in the deuteron and it is of interest to include also this short range effect .",
    "further motivation for taking it into acount here is provided by the possibility that the active @xmath64 pair can appear also in the @xmath26 state .    as a starting point fig .",
    "[ ayppdpi ] shows the results for the transverse analyzing power @xmath60 in the basic input reaction @xmath65 at two energies close to the energies of the data in @xmath66 absorption on @xmath4he .",
    "if the quasifree ansatz is correct and the employed wave functions are realistic , one would expect a similar degree of agreement also in the latter reaction .",
    "please , note that in the calculations of the @xmath65 observables the @xmath46-wave rescattering form factor has been adjusted individually for each deuteron wave function to reproduce the depth of the dip at @xmath16 as shown by the data at 515 mev @xcite ( the cut - off mass used is @xmath67 for cd bonn , @xmath68 for paris and @xmath69 for reid ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that there are differences between the results at the higher energy - even after this fitting - and that the data may favour the newer wave functions based on the paris and cd bonn potentials vs. the older reid soft core model . without the above described fixing at 515 mev the differences with different wave functions would be even larger . also , we want to point out that the magnitude of @xmath60 at the higher energy is strongly correlated with the @xmath36-state probability in the employed deuteron wave function , with @xmath60 becoming larger with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "none of the wave functions is able to reproduce correctly the dip in the data at 800 mev . in these calculations ( as in those for absorption , that will be presented in the next section ) all the partial wave amplitudes up to @xmath71",
    "were included , which was found sufficient also at 800 mev .    in the present context",
    "the above two - nucleon mechanisms are embedded in @xmath4he for which we use the parameterization of the full antisymmetric wave function @xcite . since then absorption on any pair",
    "should give the same results as on the others we can assume the coordinate @xmath13 ( e.g. @xmath72 ) to be the active one and particle 3 to be the spectator . with the above described parameterization the wave function @xmath73 would give , for example , for the cross section the result @xmath74 where @xmath75 stands for the two - nucleon transition matrix calculated for the state component @xmath25 and for a specific term @xmath76 of the parametrization of the @xmath77 wave function .",
    "the trace is over spin orientations . here",
    "the spectator effect has reduced to mere overlap integrals @xmath78 similar expressions with different @xmath25 assignments hold also for other spin dependent observables .",
    "in figs . [ modelx ] and [ modelp ] we show the differential cross sections and proton polarizations for pion absorption on @xmath4he at two energies for various trinucleon wave functions using the two - term separable fits given in ref .",
    "our particular aim is to study the behaviour of the proton polarization for different wave functions and compare the results with the data of ref .",
    "in addition to the quasideuteron , in the present calculations also absorption on the @xmath79 pair is included , although without the heavy meson exchange ( fig .",
    "[ mechs]e ) its influence has been found to be very small @xcite .",
    "however , the heavy meson exchange enhances its contribution in @xmath46-wave absorption of negative pions on @xmath4he @xcite .",
    "we find that , even after adjusting the amplitude for the basic reaction @xmath9 in order to get agreement with the analyzing power @xmath60 at 515 mev , the cd bonn ( solid ) and paris ( long dashes ) potentials give somewhat different results for both the absorption cross section and polarization on @xmath4he ( although the angular distributions are rather similar ) .",
    "the difference in the total cross section is about 10% , but without the adjustment it would be 2030% , i.e. comparable to the spread obtained in ref . @xcite for the two - nucleon reaction @xmath9 using several different deuteron wave functions . with the new trinucleon",
    "bound state wave functions we find a much better agreement with data than in earlier studies@xcite .",
    "there is still a slight overestimation ( up to 30% ) , but also the data seem to have some problems at least at 206 mev .",
    "the overestimation might be traced back to at least four possible unaccounted sources contributing .",
    "firstly , inclusion of nonabsorptive break - up of the @xmath4he should decrease other modes of inelasticity .",
    "secondly , the normalization of the five most important partial waves to unity in ref .",
    "@xcite may lead to a few per cent overestimation , since higher partial wave components in the bound state would not contribute much to the total cross section .",
    "also the free three - nucleon final state , treated at the two - nucleon level , does not take into account possible normalization effect from non - orthogonality of different three - nucleon permutations .",
    "furthermore , the minor effect of the coulomb repulsion has been neglected .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite the qualitative shape of the polarization can now be roughly reproduced with the new bound - state wave functions ( solid and dashed curves ) also at the higher energy 250 mev .",
    "the slight minimum in the old calculation has all but vanished .",
    "this result may be related to the smaller deuteron @xmath36-state probability , as in the earlier calculations neglecting this contribution reproduced the high - energy data @xcite .",
    "( however , then the 120 mev result was unacceptable . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite the momentum representation of the @xmath36-state wave function of the pair was seen to depend strongly also on the spectator momentum .",
    "the results discussed above were all obtained with the parameterization of the full antisymmetric wave function . the result with a single faddeev amplitude ( normalized to one ; see eqs .",
    "( [ single ] ) and ( [ total ] ) ) is given as the dash - dotted curve .",
    "this wave function has a significantly different short - range behaviour including a node at about 0.3 fm and is similar to the functions provided in ref .",
    "@xcite also used in the calculations of negative pion absorption on @xmath63 pairs @xcite .",
    "it is a very striking result that the single faddeev amplitude gives a qualitatively unacceptable polarization .",
    "furthermore , the dotted curve shows the original `` best '' result from ref .",
    "@xcite where the bound state wave function was based on a correlation function of protons in @xmath4he given in ref .",
    "the longer range of the full antisymmetrized wave function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is clearly reflected in the results , most directly in the decrease of the cross section .",
    "another method to study the model dependence is to switch on and off different interaction components .",
    "corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ modeldep ] for the polarization .",
    "the solid curve is the same as in fig .",
    "[ modelp ] ( cd bonn ) , while in the dotted curve absorption on the @xmath26 @xmath80 pair is neglected . in spite of the heavy meson exchange ( fig .",
    "[ mechs]e ) enhancing this contribution , the effect is still very small as was found earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite without this exchange .",
    "the present results include also the heavy meson exchange effect in absorption on the quasideuteron . in the dashed line",
    "this heavy meson exchange is neglected . due to the more condensed bound state wave function ,",
    "its effect is somewhat larger than in @xmath9 , but still does not affect the results qualitatively .",
    "finally the dash - dotted curve shows results where the quasideuteron @xmath28 component has been completely neglected .",
    "now the shape of the polarization at 250 mev is well reproduced but then the results at the lower energy are strongly at variance with the data  even qualitatively , as was also seen in ref .",
    "@xcite for a wave function based on an argonne potential calculation .",
    "although there is some uncertainty in the @xmath36-state component ( in particular its probability is unknown ) , it is obvious that it can not be made small enough for a perfect agreement with the higher energy data .",
    "in this paper we have employed new and improved parametrizations of three - nucleon wave functions , obtained from faddeev calculations with realistic @xmath1 models , with the aim of investigating the crucial observables of quasifree pion absorption on two nucleons in a three - nucleon environment .",
    "the most essential new points were the use of a total antisymmetrized wave function of the target and a nonseparable fitted form of its wave function to allow for correlations between the two relative canonical coordinates ( or momenta ) . both were seen to have an effect .",
    "although an essential improvement is found , these results confirm to some extent the earlier result ( which used less sophisticated bound state wave functions ) that conventional two - nucleon calculations can not be easily accommodated with the polarization data of @xcite . in these earlier works",
    "a somewhat poorer description was obtained for pair wave functions with a sizable @xmath28 component ( quasideuteron ) . however ,",
    "if the effect of the @xmath36 state was neglected , the high - energy polarization could be reproduced at the expense of the agreement at 120 mev as seen in fig .",
    "[ modeldep ] .",
    "the present improvement over the old results may be partly seen as a compromise with somewhat smaller @xmath36-wave components in the new deuterons and quasideuterons . however , it is hardly realistic to assume an arbitrarily low @xmath36-state probability only in order to agree with the higher energy results . in spite of these deviations , considering the quality of the agreement in the basic @xmath9 reaction and the uncertainties of the data ( only altogether five points at two distant energies ) it may be possible to regard the present agreement achieved with new , more realistic trinucleon wave functions as qualitatively acceptable .    for further improvements one might have to consider either some energy - dependent mechanism yet",
    "not included ( and possibly not necessary in two - nucleon reactions ) or admit some influence , probably active participation , of the spectator even in the quasifree kinematics of the conjugate angles . an argument for this",
    "may be found indirectly from a comparison of the true two - body and quasi - two - body results . in our model calculations",
    "the characteristic basic structure of the _ calculated _ polarization in @xmath9 ( see fig . [ ayppdpi ] ) was carried over to pion absorption on @xmath4he for a variety of @xmath77 bound state wave functions . some success in the absorption reaction",
    "was achieved perhaps , because the dip in the two - nucleon data at 800 mev was not reproduced by the basic @xmath9 amplitude .",
    "indeed , one can deduce that , if the assumption of quasifree mechanisms is valid _ and _ the abundant two - nucleon data for @xmath60 at 800 mev are used , then it is hard to understand why the dip structure should not be found also in the polarization of pion absorption on quasideuterons . since the existing data at 250 mev clearly do not indicate such a dip , they lend support for the need of other mechanisms .",
    "the latter possibility would make nuclear physics with mesonic inelasticities even more involved than previously believed . on the other hand",
    ", this could be a tool to study the effect of the `` medium '' on pionic inelasticities .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to have more data to investigate in detail the development of @xmath81 for energies intermediate to 120 and 250 mev and also to confirm the structural difference seen in the data at 250 mev",
    ". also it may be useful to apply the new wave functions in @xmath8 absorption on the singlet @xmath63 pair in @xmath4he or @xmath66 on the @xmath82 pair in a triton @xcite . in this case the two - body absorption is strongly suppressed making the possible ( but also small ) @xmath77 background more visible .",
