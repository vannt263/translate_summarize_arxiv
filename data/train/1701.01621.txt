    "optical phase - sensing stands as one of the most advanced techniques in classical metrology and has recently led to the direct detection of gravitational waves  @xcite . from the applied side ,",
    "phase - sensitive spectrally - resolved white - light interferometry ( wli ) is a key enabling tool for improving optical technologies finding numerous applications in physics , medicine , and biology . in the perspectives of both research and development",
    ", wli has been exploited for high - precision measurements such as distance and displacement  @xcite , strain , temperature and pressure  @xcite , surface profilometry  @xcite , refractometry  @xcite , group delay dispersion  @xcite , as well as chromatic dispersion  @xcite .",
    "+ the optimal precision for measuring an unknown phase @xmath2 in an optical interferometer using classical light is ruled by the standard quantum limit , @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the average number of photons involved in the measurement .",
    "the precision can be further improved by using quantum light , _",
    "e.g. _ so - called @xmath1-states which represent a coherent supersposition of having @xmath0 photons in one optical mode with zero in an orthogonal mode , and vice versa .",
    "this permits reaching the heisenberg limit , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , due to experimental imperfections , such as optical losses , noise and non - unity detector efficiencies , most of today s real - world measurements operate far away from these fundamental limits .    we introduce and",
    "demonstrate here spectrally - resolved quantum white - light interferometry ( q - wli ) as a novel approach for absolute and high - precision measurements of optical properties .",
    "the peculiar use of energy - time entangled two - photon @xmath1-states permits achieving significant conceptual advantages compared to standard wli , allowing absolute determination of optical parameters .",
    "additionally , both data treatment and experimental procedures are greatly simplified , making this method ready to be exploited as an enabling tool in a large variety of fields .      as shown in  [ fig1](a ) , the emission of a white - light source is usually directed to an interferometer in which the reference arm is free - space ( with well known optical properties ) and the other arm comprises the sample under test ( sut ) .",
    "recombining both arms at the output beam - splitter leads to an interference pattern for which the intensity follows @xmath5 , with @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 represents the wavelength , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the physical lengths of the reference arm and the sut , respectively , and @xmath10 is the refractive index of the sut .",
    "it is worth noting that interference is only observed when the interferometer is balanced within the coherence length of the white - light source , or the coherence length imposed by the resolution of the spectrometer , which is typically on the order of microns to millimetres  @xcite . in this case , the phase term reads ( more details are given in the supplementary information ) : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 stands for the symmetry center of the fringe pattern , usually referred to as stationary phase point  @xcite , @xmath13 is the wavelength offset compared to @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is a constant offset phase . fitting experimentally acquired data as a function of @xmath13 allows inferring @xmath9 , and/or the optical material parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "assuming that @xmath9 is precisely known , a typical fit to the data requires three free parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are usually all interdependent in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "consequently , uncertainties on one parameter induce errors on the others .",
    "in fact , the high number of required fitting parameters and the necessity to re - equilibrate the interferometer for every new sut stand as the main issues of this technique , therefore limiting its precision and potential for absolute determination of optical properties , as well as its ease - of - use  @xcite .    however , more accurate optical measurements are eagerly demanded in almost all fields where optics is involved .",
    "a special focus is set on the material parameter @xmath17 , as it is directly related to the chromatic dispersion coefficient @xmath18 , in which @xmath19 represents the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "more accurate measurements on @xmath20 would have tremendous repercussions for optimizing today s telecommunication networks , developing new - generation pulsed lasers and amplifiers , designing novel linear and nonlinear optical components and circuits , as well as for assessing the properties of biological tissues .    ]",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the experimental schematic for our new concept of spectrally - resolved quantum wli ( q - wli ) , intended to overcome the above - mentioned issues .",
    "the quantum white - light source is composed of a continuous - wave pump laser and a non - linear crystal in which energy - time entangled photon pairs are generated through spontaneous parametric downconversion  @xcite .",
    "this process obeys the conservation of the energy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 represents the wavelength of the pump laser photons , and @xmath23 are the wavelengths of the individual photons for each generated pair .",
    "another implication of the conservation of the energy is that the degenerate wavelength of the emission spectrum is @xmath24 . + the paired photons are sent to the interferometer which is , intentionally , strongly unbalanced .",
    "this allows distinguishing contributions for which both photons take opposite paths ( delayed arrival times at the interferometer s outputs ) or the same path ( no arrival time difference )  @xcite . at one interferometer output ,",
    "a single photon detector ( spd ) is employed , and in the other a single - photon sensitive spectrometer .",
    "time tagging electronics allows to infer the photon arrival time differences , and to post - select only zero - time - delay events .",
    "this procedure leads to the formation of a two - photon @xmath25-state : @xmath26 here , the ket vectors , indexed by s and r , indicate the number of photons in the reference and sut arm , respectively , and @xmath27 .",
    "as detailed in the supplementary information , after setting @xmath28 , the spectral dependence of the phase term @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is an offset term . in order to infer @xmath29 ,",
    "a two - photon coincidence measurement is performed , taking advantage of the fact that the rate @xmath32 at which pairs are projected onto the @xmath1-state is phase - dependent : @xmath33 .",
    "the term @xmath14 has been object of research in the past  @xcite , as it allows measuring optical phase - shifts at constant wavelengths with doubled sensitivity compared to the standard approach . by taking advantage of energy - time entanglement ,",
    "we address here , for the first time , the wavelength - dependent term in equation  [ quantumphase ] .",
    "experimentally , this is made possible by recording @xmath32 as a function of @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ the two - photon coincidence rate is measured as a function of the paired - photons wavelengths .",
    "+ we now highlight a few pertinent purely quantum - enabled features provided by equation  [ quantumphase ] . compared to equation  [ classicalphase ] , the dependence on the third - order term @xmath34",
    "is cancelled due to energy - time entanglement  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 does not have to be extracted from the data , as it is exactly twice the wavelength of the continuous - wave pump laser , @xmath22 , and can therefore be known with extremely high accuracy .",
    "this means that the quantum strategy allows data fitting using exactly one free parameter , namely @xmath17 which is an essential step towards absolute optical property determination with high precision .",
    "additionally , we note that the @xmath1-state s ability to interfere does not arise from the coherence length of the individual photons , but from that of the photon pair . for energy - time entanglement ,",
    "this coherence length is directly related to that of the continuous wave pump laser ( typically from several to hundreds of meters )  @xcite . this allows to operate the interferometer in largely unbalanced conditions , such that no re - alignment is necessary when changing the sut .",
    "finally , due to the use of a two - photon @xmath1-state , a doubled sensitivity on @xmath17 is achieved , allowing to perform measurements on much shorter samples compared to standard wli ( down to the mm to cm scale ) .      as a sut we use a 1 m long standard single - mode fibre from corning ( smf28e ) .",
    "for all measurements , the interferometer is actively stabilized using a reference laser and a piezoelectric transducer on one of the mirrors in the reference arm ( more details are provided in the methods section ) .",
    "this ensures that @xmath14 remains constant .",
    "+ for chromatic dispersion measurements using standard wli , a superluminescent diode is used . at the output of the interferometer we measure an average spectral intensity of @xmath35125pw / nm from @xmath36 .",
    "interferograms are recorded using a standard spectrometer from anritsu ( model ms9710b ) with 0.1s integration time and 0.5 nm resolution .",
    "+ for the q - wli approach , the employed light source is made of a wavelength - stabilized 780.24 nm laser , pumping a type-0 periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguide ( ppln / w ) .",
    "the quasi - phase matching in the ppln / w is chosen such as to generate energy - time entangled photon pairs around the degenerate wavelength of @xmath37 with a bandwidth of about 140 nm . here , the spectral intensity is about 25fw / nm at the interferometer output . to detect the paired photons",
    ", we use an ingaas spd ( idq 220 ) at one interferometer output .",
    "the single photon spectrometer at the other output is made of a wavelength - tunable 0.5 nm bandpass filter , followed by another ingaas spd ( idq 230 ) . to partially compensate for the significantly reduced spectral intensity of the photon pair source , we use an integration time of 8s .",
    "+ all measurements are repeated 100 times on the same sut in order to infer the statistical accuracy of both wli and q - wli approaches .",
    "typical interference patterns for chromatic dispersion measurements using both methods are shown in  [ fig2](a , b ) . with the q - wli setup , twice as much interference fringes are obtained for the same spectral bandwidth which is a direct consequence of the doubled phase sensitivity of the two - photon @xmath1-state .",
    "is extracted .",
    "error bars assume poissonian photon number statistics.[fig2 ] ]    after acquiring @xmath38 measurements on the same sut , we infer the precision of both approaches .",
    "the results of the statistical data analysis are shown in  [ fig3 ] . for standard wli",
    ", we obtain , on average , @xmath39 at @xmath40 with a standard deviation of @xmath41 .",
    "this result is amongst the best reported to date in the literature  @xcite . for q - wli , we measure , on average , @xmath42 at @xmath37 with a significantly better standard deviation of @xmath43 .",
    "+ further statistical data analysis shows kurtosis parameters of 0.182 and 0.276 for standard and quantum wli , respectively , proving that both data sets converge towards a normal distribution . comparing the data sets with levene s null hypothesis test gives @xmath44 , providing very strong evidence that the improved results obtained with the quantum strategy are essentially impossible to have occurred based on random sampling from the classical measurements .    in our data ,",
    "we observe a minimal offset of the central values which is explained by either a slight wavelength offset of the spectrometer ( @xmath45 ) used for the standard measurements , and/or that the interferometer was unbalanced by about @xmath46 .",
    "the consequence is an error on the fitting parameter @xmath12 , which is then translated to an error in @xmath15  @xcite . at this point",
    ", we highlight that for the q - wli approach , @xmath12 is essentially known with absolute accuracy , and only one free fitting parameter is required .",
    "additionally , an unbalanced interferometer does not influence the measurement .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider that q - wli can be used to determine the chromatic dispersion coefficient with absolute accuracy .",
    "we also emphasize that the measurements performed with q - wli involve @xmath3560 times less photons transmitted through the sut compared to standard wli .",
    "this clearly underlines that the improved results obtained with the entanglement - enhanced strategy is due to aspects from both the fundamental and conceptual sides .    ]",
    "another advantage provided by q - wli lies in straightforward device calibration .",
    "all the optical components in the interferometer actually show small residual chromatic dispersion , and this undesired offset needs to be evaluated and subtracted from the data in order to avoid systematic errors . for standard wli , this implies that the sut has to be removed and that the length of the reference arm has to be reduced accordingly ( typically on the order of 1 m ) .",
    "this procedure is technically challenging , time - consuming , and might lead to additional systematic errors .    at this point",
    ", q - wli shows its ability for user - friendly operation .",
    "interference is observed for interferometer path length differences up to the coherence length of the pump laser , in our case @xmath35250 m .",
    "consequently , residual chromatic dispersion can be measured directly after removing the sut , without any realignment .    ]",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the experimental results that we have obtained when measuring chromatic dispersion in our bare interferometer , _",
    "i.e. _ with the sut .",
    "it turns out that in our interferometer , residual chromatic dispersion amounts to @xmath3510% of the measured values on the 1 m sut .",
    "for all the data discussed above , except for the raw data in  [ fig2](a , b ) , we have therefore subtracted the residual chromatic dispersion .",
    "we have introduced and demonstrated the concept of spectrally - resolved q - wli exploiting energy - time entangled two - photon @xmath1-states . compared to standard measurements ,",
    "the @xmath1-state permits achieving a two times higher phase sensitivity .",
    "more strikingly , the peculiar use of such quantum states of light reduces the number of free parameters for fitting experimental data from three to one , representing a major advantage for determining optical properties with high precision and absolute accuracy .",
    "in addition , our setup does not require a balanced interferometer for performing the measurement which represents a significant time - saving advantage compared to standard wli , especially for device calibration and when considering measurements on a large set of samples .    as an exemplary demonstration",
    ", we have applied our scheme to infer chromatic dispersion in a standard single - mode fibre , obtaining 2.6 times more precise results compared to state - of - the - art realizations , despite using @xmath3560 times less photons .",
    "we note that the sensitivity of our approach could be further doubled by using a double - pass configuration  @xcite , towards measurements on short samples , such as optical components and waveguide structures ( mm to cm length scale ) .",
    "such measurements would also be of interest for medical applications where precise knowledge on chromatic dispersion in tissues is required to yield optimal image quality in optical coherence tomography  @xcite . in this perspective , the reduced number of photons required for quantum white - light interferometry is also highly interesting for measurements performed on photosensitive biological samples  @xcite . regarding optical telecommunication systems , by rotating the polarization of the entangled photon pairs , our setup could be also used for measuring polarization mode dispersion in optical components , which would lead to refinement of manufacturing processes . in the end , ultimate measurement accuracy at the heisenberg limit would be reached by deterministically generating @xmath1-states  @xcite , combined with near - unity efficiency superconducting single photon detectors  @xcite .",
    "+ we therefore believe that combining fundamental and conceptual advantages enabled by quantum light is a very promising approach for the future development and improvement of applications requiring absolute and high - accuracy measurements of optical properties .",
