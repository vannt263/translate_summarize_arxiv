    "while an exact analytic formula for gluon production in @xmath2 collisions in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework is still not known , we do know that in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions gluon production at the level of classical gluon fields and leading-@xmath5 nonlinear quantum evolution is given by the @xmath1-factorization formula @xcite : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the total rapidity interval of the collision , @xmath8 , boldface variables denote two - component transverse plane vectors @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the unintegrated gluon distributions in the proton and the nucleus , respectively , which are defined by @xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the quantity @xmath14 denotes the forward scattering amplitude for a gluon dipole of transverse size @xmath15 with its center located at the impact parameter @xmath16 scattering on a target nucleus with total rapidity interval @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath14 can , in general , be found from the jimwlk evolution equation . in the large-@xmath18 limit it is related to the quark dipole forward scattering amplitude on the same nucleus @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 can be found from the bk evolution equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 from is also a gluon dipole amplitude , but taken in a dilute regime , where it is found by solving the linear balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation .    for the gluon production",
    "was derived in the fixed coupling approximation . however , the dipole amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath14 and @xmath22 are now known for the running coupling case due to the completion of the running coupling calculations for the bfkl / bk / jimwlk evolution equations @xcite . using the running - coupling bk ( rcbk ) equation ,",
    "the calculational framework presented above , when applied to heavy ion collisions by replacing @xmath24 in , and implemented with a careful inclusion of the nuclear geometry fluctuations , led to the prediction made in @xcite of the charged particle multiplicity as a function of the collision centrality for the lhc .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by the alice data in @xcite .",
    "however , at the time the prediction @xcite was made , the scales of the couplings explicitly shown in eqs .",
    ", , and were not known and had to be modeled .",
    "our goal here is to fix the scales of those couplings for the lowest - order gluon production .",
    "to include running coupling corrections we follow the blm scale - setting procedure @xcite , which is known to be correct at least at the leading order in @xmath25 .",
    "one first needs to resum the contribution of all quark bubble corrections giving powers of @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the number of quark flavors and @xmath28 the physical coupling at some arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath29 .",
    "we then complete @xmath27 to the full beta - function by replacing @xmath30 in the obtained expression . here",
    "@xmath31 is the one - loop qcd beta - function .",
    "after this , the powers of @xmath32 should combine into physical running couplings @xmath33 at various momentum scales @xmath34 which would follow from this calculation .",
    "we use the @xmath35 renormalization scheme .    as was originally argued in @xcite ,",
    "including running coupling corrections into the diagrams of below assuming that only a gluon can be produced in the final state would leave one factor of the coupling at an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath29 .",
    "following @xcite we rectify the problem by redefining the gluon production cross - section to include production of collinear gluon  gluon and quark  anti - quark pairs with the invariant mass lower than some collinear ir cutoff @xmath36 .",
    "this new observable is completely @xmath29-independent and expressible in terms of the running coupling constants .",
    "gluon production at the lowest order in the coupling is shown in in the @xmath37 light - cone gauge . at this order",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution is @xmath38 such that reduces to @xmath39 our goal is to set the scales for the three couplings in .",
    "light - cone gauge .",
    ", width=566 ]    the final result for the lowest - order gluon production cross section with the running coupling corrections included is @xcite @xmath40 with the momentum scale @xmath34 being a complicated function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 given in @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature is that the scale @xmath43 is complex - valued !",
    "the cross - section is , of course , real , as it contains a complex - valued coupling constant multiplied by its conjugate , @xmath44 .",
    "clearly looks like the fixed - coupling cross - section with three factors of fixed - coupling replaced by the seven running couplings : we chose to refer to this structure as _ the septumvirate _ of couplings @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the scale @xmath34 is that in the @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) limit @xmath47 reducing to @xmath48",
    "using the lowest - order expression we would like to conjecture the following running - coupling generalization of : @xmath49 with the new ( rescaled ) distribution functions defined by ( cf .",
    "eqs . and ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 one may use this ansatz , along with @xmath52 obtained from the rcbk evolution to further improve the existing cgc phenomenology for particle multiplicity along with its centrality and rapidity dependence at rhic and lhc .",
