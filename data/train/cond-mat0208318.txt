    "shot noise in a mesoscopic conductor is a consequence of the stochastic character of electron tunneling and of the discreteness of charge . unlike thermal noise , shot noise describes the non - equilibrium fluctuations of current",
    "; therefore , the study of current fluctuations can provide further understanding of properties related to correlation mechanisms , internal energy scales or the carrier statistics which can not be obtained by measuring the average current  @xcite .",
    "a well studied example of physical processes where electron correlations play a dominant role is the phenomenon of coulomb blockade . in a system of small tunneling junctions , due to the large electrostatic energy ( as compared to temperature or voltages ) ,",
    "the electronic charge is transported one by one .",
    "this effect leads to many remarkable features in transport properties and has been a subject of extensive study for the last decades  @xcite . as an example",
    ", the strong dependence of the current - voltage characteristics on the gate charge was exploited to use a single electron transistor ( set ) as a highly sensitive charge detector  @xcite , and proposed as measuring apparatus of the charge state of a josephson quantum bit  @xcite .",
    "since it leads to a strong correlation of consecutive tunneling events , coulomb blockade has turned out to manifest itself in a peculiar way on the current noise .",
    "such an effect has been studied both in the sequential tunneling  @xcite and in the cotunneling regime  @xcite .",
    "additional interest in studying noise in single electron devices comes from the recently proposed schemes that employ current fluctuation measurements to detect entanglement in solid state systems  @xcite .",
    "an even richer scenario occurs when the coherence of charge carriers is maintained over a significant portions of the system .",
    "such a circumstance is encountered quite often when the tunneling junctions are superconducting . in this case , the charge carriers are cooper pairs , and their coherent tunneling across the junctions gives rise to a series of pronounced structures in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics at sub - gap voltages  @xcite . furthermore , as analyzed in ref .  , the scattering of quasi - particles ( and consequently the shot noise ) in superconducting point contacts",
    "is significantly enhanced in the presence of the supercurrent produced by a coherent flow of cooper pairs .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a superconducting double tunnel junction device , operating in a suitably chosen bias voltage regime , such that one of the junctions of the set is on resonance for cooper pair tunneling ( the case where cooper pair resonance occurs on both junctions has been recently analyzed in ref .  ) . the interplay between coherence and interaction",
    "is explored by sweeping the operating point of the device through the cooper pair resonance .",
    "we will show that the fluctuations of the charge on the central island are sensitive to both coulomb blockade and quantum coherence .",
    "more pronounced effects arise in the regime in which the rates of incoherent quasi - particle tunneling matches the frequency of coherent cooper - pair oscillation .",
    "this gives rise to an enhanced fluctuation of charge in the central - island and to a substantial suppression of the current noise . by investigating the statistics of the tunneling events ,",
    "we show that the suppression in the shot noise is related to the deviation of the counting statistics from the poissonian distribution .",
    "the probability distribution of tunneling events exhibits a parity dependence and remains non - poissonian in a wide range of parameter values .",
    "the interplay between coherence and coulomb blockade affects the overall charge transport and is also clearly observed in the finite frequency behavior of the current noise .",
    "its power spectrum displays a sharp resonance peak at the josephson frequency , resulting from coherent oscillations between two quantum states .",
    "the work presented here applies to the setup used in a recent experiment  @xcite to probe the coherent evolution of quantum states in a cooper pair box as well as in an earlier experiment  @xcite on resonant cooper pair tunneling . in this paper",
    "we extend the results of ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ long : sec2 ] , we introduce the model to describe the set transistor and we describe the relevant processes involved in the josephson - quasiparticle cycle . in the same section",
    "we also introduce the master equation , in its general form , used to obtain all the results of this work .",
    "the solution of the master equation is worked out to analyze in detail the fluctuations of the charge on the central electrode and , in particular , the spectrum of the charge fluctuation as measured by a detector coupled to the island ( section  [ long : sec3 ] ) , the counting statistics for the tunneled charges ( section  [ long : sec4 ] ) , and the shot noise of the current ( section  [ long : sec5 ] ) . in section  [",
    "long : sec5 ] we discuss in some details the properties of the shot noise at zero frequency , making explicit the results already contained in the counting statistics . in the same section we also discuss the frequency dependence of the shot noise .",
    "section  [ long : sec6 ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the system we consider is a superconducting set ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) , which consists in a small central electrode ( island ) connected by tunnel junctions to two leads and capacitively coupled to a gate electrode .",
    "the electrostatic energy of the island can be adjusted by controlling the gate voltage @xmath2 .",
    "a transport voltage @xmath1 is applied to the outer leads , determining the current flowing through the device .",
    "letting @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the gate and left and right junction capacitances , respectively , the electrostatic charging energy is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total capacitance of the island .",
    "the device operates in the coulomb blockade regime , i.e. with the charging energy much larger than both the josephson coupling energy @xmath7 and the thermal energy @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , but still much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath10 which we suppose to be the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "charge can pass through the tunnel barriers coherently and incoherently .",
    "in addition to quasi - particle tunneling , josephson effect allows to maintain coherence in the cooper - pair tunneling processes",
    ". this coherence does play an important role in transport as long as charge states which differ by one cooper pair are almost degenerate .",

    "since the set transistor operates in the charge regime ( @xmath39 ) , we can take advantage of the strong suppression of charge fluctuations to use the eigenstates of @xmath28 as basis states for the island .",
    "moreover , we focus on the bias regime @xmath40 where only the two charge states with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are nearly degenerate .",
    "such a condition implies that quasi - particle tunneling only takes place from the central island toward the right electrode , while the left junction allows only for coherent cooper pair tunneling .",

    "the dip in the noise is most pronounced at resonance ( @xmath75).,width=226 ]    ) for @xmath203 , and ( b ) at a fixed weak dephasing rate ( @xmath204 ) for @xmath205.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) for @xmath203 , and ( b ) at a fixed weak dephasing rate ( @xmath204 ) for @xmath205.,title=\"fig : \" ]     as a function of frequency @xmath206 in the ( a ) strong ( @xmath207 ) and ( b ) weak ( @xmath208 ) quasi - particle tunneling limits .",
    "for both plots , @xmath75 and @xmath209 were assumed.,title=\"fig : \" ] as a function of frequency @xmath206 in the ( a ) strong ( @xmath207 ) and ( b ) weak ( @xmath208 ) quasi - particle tunneling limits .",
    "for both plots , @xmath75 and @xmath209 were assumed.,title=\"fig : \" ]      in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] we show the typical behavior of the finite - frequency noise spectrum in the ( a ) strong and ( b ) weak dephasing limits .",
    "it is interesting to notice that ( only ) in the weak dephasing limit ( @xmath195 ) , there is a resonance peak of the form @xmath210 where the resonance frequency is given by @xmath211 \\,.\\ ] ] clearly , the peak is an effect of coherent quantum oscillations between the two energy levels separated by @xmath212 , induced by the josephson effect across the left junction . as expected , the resonance peak is reduced in its height and broadened in its width with increasing @xmath69 . on the contrary , as @xmath81 increases , the peak gets sharper and the peak height increases quadratically with @xmath81 .",
    "however , this should not be confused with the zero - frequency case , where @xmath81 effectively enhances the decoherence effects .",
    "as @xmath81 increases , the josephson oscillation across the left junction becomes faster , and there are less chances that it is interrupted by the quasi - particle tunneling across the right junction .",
    "this , in turns , implies that the coherent oscillation is better defined and the spectral component ( especially @xmath213 ) at frequency @xmath214 is highly enhanced . for a vanishingly small quasi - particle tunneling rate",
    ", @xmath215 would approximately become a delta  like function , centered at @xmath216 .",
    "however , one should not be misled by this result , since the noise is always proportional to the average current , which vanishes in this limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning here on the relation between this result and the description of the noise output from linear detector  @xcite . in the setup considered in this work",
    ", the right electrode has the role of the detector of cooper pair oscillations ; since the total current in the circuit is due to quasi - particle tunneling ( i.e. it is a _ dissipative _ current ) , the output signal may be considered as classical .",
    "this has to be compared to the case of a detector measuring the charge on the island .",
    "there , the back - action of the detector was essential to produce an observable result . in the case of the current , instead",
    ", the `` detector '' is intrinsically part of the system and it couples to the observed quantity in an essentially non - linear way .",
    "in this paper we considered properties of the distribution of the transmitted charge in a superconducting set tuned close to a cooper pair resonance .",
    "the dominant process to the transport in the regime considered here , is the jqp cycle , a process in which coherent cooper pair oscillations are accompanied by ( incoherent ) quasi - particle tunneling .",
    "the interplay between the coherence and the strong coulomb blockade manifests itself in various ways both in the counting statistics and in the shot noise .",
    "we found two distinct regimes characterized by different ratios of the time scales for dephasing and relaxation , @xmath217 in the strong dephasing limit or @xmath218 in the opposite case of weak dephasing .",
    "a generic feature of the counting statistics , valid in both the regimes , is its even - odd asymmetry related to the fact that charge transport is mediated by the cooper pair tunneling .",
    "other properties are more pronounced in one of the two regimes .",
    "an example is the dependence of @xmath103 on the initial time @xmath108 .",
    "this is clearly visible in the strong dephasing limit while quickly lost in the weak dephasing regime since , because of the strong josephson energy , the state changes significantly before quasi - particles have any time to be produced .",
    "another important point is that the counting statistics is not poissonian , due to the relevance of correlations between different tunneling events . as a consequence",
    "the fano factor is different from the classical value .",
    "the maximal suppression of the zero - frequency shot noise is observed when the quasi - particle tunneling rate is comparable to the frequency scale of the coherent cooper pair oscillations .",
    "we finally investigated the shot noise at finite frequencies , which shows a resonance peak at the josephson oscillation frequency .",
    "this maximum can be interpreted as an effect of coherent quantum transitions between the two energy levels involved in the transport phenomena in the device .",
