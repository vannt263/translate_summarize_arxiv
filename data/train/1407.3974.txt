    "the broad  band spectrum , using high  energy data extending up to 100  kev in conjunction with softer x - ray observations from _ asca _ and _ ginga _ , is described by a power  law continuum with strong photoelectric absorption ( i.e. done , madejski , smith 1996 ) , with a column density @xmath16 ( under the assumption of solar abundances ) of about @xmath17 @xmath14 .",

    "primary continuum penetrates the obscuring matter and peaks at @xmath18 kev , depending on the actual value of the optical depth .",

    " ray background spectrum at energies close to its @xmath19 kev peak ( gilli et al .",
    "2007 ; treister et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of ngc4945 also shows a strong iron k@xmath20 line ( ew @xmath211 kev ) that is thought to arise from fluorescence in matter which is more remote from the nucleus than the primary continuum ( e.g. matt et al . 1996 ) .    the hard x  ray emission in the _ bepposax _ @xmath22 kev band has been observed to vary by a factor of two on timescales as short as 10@xmath23  s ( guainazzi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this suggests that the solid angle subtended by the compton ",
    "thick absorber , as seen by the source , is unlikely to be large , and the heavy absorption of the primary continuum is probably confined to a disk - like structure or a `` skinny '' torus with a relatively small half  opening angle ( @xmath24 ) , otherwise the scattered x ",
    "rays would noticeably dilute the hard x  ray variability ( madejski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "ngc4945 was also observed with _ suzaku _",
    "( itoh et al . 2008 ) , which confirmed the strong hard x - ray variability of the heavily obscured primary continuum .",
    "the spectrum below 10 kev is dominated by a constant reflected continuum along with neutral iron k@xmath20 , k@xmath25 and nickel k@xmath20 lines .",
    "an extensive discussion of the origin of the hard x  ray emission from ngc4945 is presented in yaqoob ( 2012 ) using state  of  the  art monte carlo simulations ( the mytorus model ) to treat absorption and scattering in the compton ",
    "thick regime .",
    "they conclude , in agreement with previous studies , though on much more solid statistical and physical grounds , that a clumpy medium with a small covering factor provides the best description of the observed spectrum and variability .",

    "high angular resolution observations with _",
    "( schurch et al .",
    "2002 , done et al .",
    "2003 ) reveal a clear change in the nature of the @xmath27 kev x  ray spectrum with distance from the nucleus . the compact , unresolved emission confirms the basic absorbed power  law scenario given above . the closest ( @xmath28 pc ) soft x  ray ( @xmath29 kev ) emission is likely associated with strong circumnuclear starburst activity that is well modelled by a two temperature ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 kev ) optically thin thermal plasma ( schurch et al .",
    "the starburst region also contains cold reflection signatures ( see also marinucci et al .",
    "2012 ) . despite the fact that the x  ray images in the line emission band ( @xmath32 kev ) and in the @xmath33 kev band show an asymmetric and clumpy spatial distribution with a size of tens of parsecs , they almost perfectly match and are likely to be associated with the cold reflector .",
    "unresolved clumpiness may explain the low covering factor inferred from the hard x  ray variability .",
    "the more distant region ( beyond @xmath11 pc ) reveals distinctly different emission , with the spectrum showing soft continuum plus emission lines .",
    "this more extended emission appears morphologically as a plume , and was modelled as a combination of photoionized and collisionally ionized plasma , with @xmath34 kev ( see done et al .",
    "2003 for details ) .",

    "the nucleus of ngc4945 is a strong source of megamaser activity , detected in h@xmath35o ( dos santos & lepine 1979 ) .",
    "detailed , velocity  resolved maps reveal multiple megamaser spots revolving around the central black hole : this allows the precise determination of the black hole mass , at @xmath36 ( greenhill , moran , & herrnstein 1997 ) .",
    "the megamaser spots are irregularly distributed and clumpy .",
    "madejski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and done et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that the megamaser spots are aligned with the absorbing disk / torus at @xmath37 pc .",
    "in addition to this dense absorbing disk , the nucleus is completely embedded in a column of @xmath38 @xmath14 at @xmath39 pc , which may be due to a bar  driven gas inflow ( ott et al .",
    "2001 ) or perhaps a high  latitude extension of the disk / torus .",
    "the extreme absorption region is surrounded by an extended , dusty , lower absorption region on scales of @xmath40 pc in the starburst region .",
    "the nucleus of ngc4945 is characterized by a high and variable accretion rate .",

    "observations obtained over a time interval of about 5 months provide spectra and variability of unprecedented quality , allowing detailed modelling of the source geometry .",
    "the primary findings can be summarized as follows :    * in the _ nustar _ band the source is highly variable with a doubling / halving time as short as 16 ksec .",
    "the maximum variability is in the @xmath47 kev band , while below 10 kev the source is constant . *",
    "the analysis of the hardness ratio light curves implies strong spectral variability above 810 kev , which has been addressed for the first time in this source , via state ",
    "resolved spectral analysis of the _ nustar _ high energy spectra . *",
    "the state ",
    "resolved spectral analysis , confirmed that the constant x  ray flux below 10 kev is consistent with being due to reflection from compton  thick material .",
    "the shape of the reflected continuum below 10 kev and the iron line complex has been determined by combining _ nustar _ with _",
    "suzaku _ and _ chandra _ observations . * the variability in the hard x  ray ( @xmath44 10 kev ) band is mainly due to variation in the intensity of the primary continuum piercing through a high column density @xmath16 @xmath48 10@xmath49 @xmath14 absorber .",
    "there is evidence of a steepening of the primary continuum spectral slope with increasing flux .",
    "the spectral and variability properties indicate , in agreement with previous results , a small covering factor ( @xmath50 ) for the obscuring matter which is best parameterized in terms of a clumpy toroidal distribution .",
    "* a power spectral density analysis suggests that the variability is almost identical to that observed in seyfert 1 galaxies , reinforcing the interpretation of spectral variability as due to variations in the primary emission .",
    "* there is no clear evidence for a high  energy cut  off with lower limits of the order of @xmath51 kev . *",
    "the intrinsic continuum variability is associated with a variation of the eddington ratio in the range @xmath52 . assuming a distance of @xmath0 3.8 mpc there is no evidence of super eddington accretion . * with the assumption that the x  ray luminosity variations trace the bolometric luminosity , the accretion rate correlates with the intrinsic spectral index , in agreement with the trend observed for relatively high  redshift agn .",
    "the fact that the same trend is observed for different states of the same source lend further support to a close link between the hard x  ray slope and the physics of accretion processes .",
