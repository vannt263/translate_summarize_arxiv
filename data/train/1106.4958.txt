    "however , a different approach typically needs to be used for each of these systems , so that a given control methods may not readily be transferred to a different physical system .    employing molecular systems as ` quantum hardware ' @xcite offers the advantages of high reproducibility , chemically engineered system properties , and the potential for self - assembly into more complex functional units .",
    "the key challenge for nuclear spin - spin entanglement is achieving fast and switchable control over the interactions between adjacent quantum bits ( qubits ) .",
    "several previous publications have proposed introducing a mediator spin , whose mutual coupling to the qubit spins provides a route for a controlled entangling operation @xcite . in these studies",
    "the mediator spin is usually of the same type as the qubit spins and possesses spin 1/2 .",
    "in contrast , many molecular structures possess optically - excited triplet states ( i.e. states with spin 1 character ) that could be used as mediators for nearby nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experiments @xcite we develop theoretical control strategies for this class of systems .",
    "for our model we consider a structure comprising three integral components : two nuclear spin qubits labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a mediator spin system with an optical degree of freedom .",
    "we denote the ground state of the mediator as @xmath2\\rangle}$ ] and the first excited state as @xmath3\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "further , @xmath2\\rangle}$ ] is assumed to be spin - silent , while @xmath3\\rangle}$ ] possesses an electronic spin 1 character .",
    "the spin 1 ( quasi)particle is thus created upon optical excitation of the mediator system .",
    "importantly , the two spin qubits do not directly interact with each other , yet both are coupled to the excited state of the mediator with an isotropic heisenberg interaction as schematically depicted in fig .",

    "by contrast , an nv@xmath15-centre in diamond surrounded by two @xmath16c atoms @xcite is an example of a system in which the spin 1 mediator is not susceptible to decay and is ever - present .",

    "we have neglected all matrix elements between the subspaces @xmath55 and @xmath49 ( @xmath56 ) ; the effect of these matrix elements is negligible because the electronic zeeman splitting @xmath57 is much larger than the nuclear zeeman splittings .",
    "the dynamics in each of the @xmath49 is therefore closed and can be described by an effective @xmath58 hamiltonian of the form given above .",
    "we shall now analyze the nuclear spin dynamics arising from each of those effective subspace hamiltonians .",
    "a term in the hamiltonian that is proportional to the identity has no effect on the dynamics within the subspace , so we can subtract @xmath59 and @xmath60 from the subspace hamiltonians for @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively ( thereby neglecting unimportant phases that are common to all states in each block ) .",

    "the state corrections to first order perturbation theory then introduce a small mixing of computational basis states with corrections of magnitude @xmath82 which are negligible for @xmath83 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath84 thus coincide with those of @xmath85 ( which are simply the computational basis states ) to a very good approximation .",
    "analogously to our approach in the symmetric case , we proceed by analyzing individual effective hamiltonians for the subspaces @xmath86 ( @xmath52 ) . after adding a suitable constant to each subspace",

    "it is easy to see that the eigenstates reduce to those of the symmetric case for a vanishing perturbation ( @xmath108 ) , whereas they tend to the computational basis states for a larger perturbation as required for the asymmetric system ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the contrasting analyses presented in the previous section suggest that the dynamics of the system will vary significantly depending on its parameters .",
    "therefore , different approaches for achieving controlled entanglement between the two nuclear spins will be required . in this section",
    "we will show how to do this in each case ; we begin with the symmetric system introduced in section  [ sec : symmetric - case ] .      for the symmetric system",

    "the free time evolution in any of the subspaces @xmath49 takes suitable initial product states of the nuclear spins to entangled states at certain subsequent points of time . in order to quantify the performance of the desired operation",
    ", we consider the _ entangling power _ of the unitary operator that describes the time evolution of the system .",
    "the entangling power is defined as the mean linear entropy produced by the unitary operator acting on a uniform distribution of all ( pure ) product states @xcite .",

    "however , the characteristic timescale over which entanglement builds up differs significantly between the subspaces , since @xmath117 to leading order , and this ratio is typically much larger than one .",

    "second , certain particular input states can reach maximal entanglement in less time than @xmath131 ; for example , the time evolution @xmath132 takes @xmath133\\rangle}$ ] to a maximally entangled state .",
    "finally , the ( optical ) excitation , whose natural lifetime @xmath134 is assumed to be longer than the time it takes to build up the entanglement @xmath135 , needs to be destroyed quickly enough such that no further ( slower ) evolution unwinding the achieved entanglement occurs in the @xmath136 subspace .",
    "this can either be achieved with a coherent optical @xmath137-pulse , or alternatively by simply waiting for the system to decay back to its ground state if the following hierarchy of timescales exists in the system @xmath138 however , in contrast to the de - excitation with a coherent laser pulse , it is not immediately obvious that the nuclear spin entanglement can survive the optical decay process ; we will therefore now take a small diversion to analyse this decay process in detail .",

    "several possibilities exist for exploiting this rich transition spectrum in order to realise an entangling operation . in the following",
    "we shall discuss three methods in more detail : a single microwave @xmath257-pulse , a pulse sequence of radio- and microwave pulses , and finally an adiabatic following method .      simply applying a selective @xmath257-pulse with the frequency of any of the microwave transitions given in eq .   and naturally implements a cphase - gate by imparting a phase of @xmath258 to only one of the four nuclear spin states @xcite .    if the lifetime of the transition was infinite ( and in the absence of other spin dephasing mechanisms ) , the @xmath257-pulse could be made perfectly selective , achieved by a pulse that is long in the time domain and accordingly spectrally narrow in the frequency domain @xcite . however , in practice the optical lifetime will be finite and this may limit the selectivity and thus the amount of entanglement that can be achieved . the challenge is to find the right balance between a fast pulse that is only partially selective , and a slow pulse during which the system suffers from the decoherence induced by the decay .",
    "we proceed by analysing the trade - off that arises from these constraints in the following .",

    "while optical decay during the application of the pulse may preserve some coherence between the nuclear spin states for specific parameter combinations , this is no longer the case once the pulse has finished : the decay to the ground state for an asymmetric system in the absence of microwave driving invariably destroys the nuclear coherences .",
    "therefore , we must use a different approach for taking the system back to its ground state .",
    "the first possibility is de - excitation using a resonant optical @xmath137-pulse .",
    "another option would be to significantly ` speed up ' the decay process , e.g. by exciting the system into a different metastable excited state which is known to quickly decay to the ground state .",

    "we have identified control methods applicable over a wide range of system parameters and studied their performance with regard to the predominant decoherence mechanism . for the symmetric system consisting of two identical nuclear spins as qubits , the free time evolution is naturally entangling , but the characteristic timescale of the dynamics depends on the state of the excitation and can vary over several orders of magnitude , opening up the possibility of effectively switching the interaction on and off . for an asymmetric system , a different route needs to be taken and we have presented one adiabatic and two dynamic methods for creating entanglement in this case . we have also included a discussion of the crossover regime between the asymmetric and symmetric system to establish the robustness of the symmetric operation .",
    "we have shown that the symmetric control method can be remarkably robust against uncertainty or fluctuations in the coupling constants and nuclear zeeman splittings . as another advantage of the symmetric system , the system can decay back to the ground state without destroying the nuclear spin coherence .",
    "conversely , for the asymmetric system additional control is required for the de - excitation step , yet it is easier to address the nuclear spins individually for single qubit operations , initialisation and read - out .",
    "interestingly , the active control methods proposed for the asymmetric system are much faster than waiting for the free time evolution in the symmetric case , and they can also be applied to the symmetric system if a short optical lifetime makes this approach advantageous .",
    "finally , we note that the adiabatic control method is intrinsically more robust against control pulse and static field inhomogeneities , making it uniquely suitable for experiments with ensembles of identical systems .",
    "astonishingly , the time required for such an adiabatic operation is only about twice as long as for its dynamical counterpart .",
