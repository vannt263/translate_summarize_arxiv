    "exoplanet surveys have recently measured the frequency of exoplanets as a function of a host of parameters like stellar mass , metallicity , orbital separation , and planetary mass @xcite .",
    "these parameters help to inform our understanding of how and where exoplanets form .",
    "the observed frequency of gas giants at small ( @xmath112 au ) separations rises from @xmath23% for dm stars to @xmath214% for solar metallicity a - type stars ; this dearth of massive planets around dm stars is consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite of the core accretion model @xcite . at larger orbital separations ( 10s-100s of au ) , the frequency of gas giants around dm stars is @xmath116% @xcite .",
    "recent results from kepler have shown both that the frequency of small mass planets at short orbital periods increases around low mass stars @xcite and there is a lack of planets larger than 2.5 r@xmath12 surrounding dm stars at short orbital periods .",
    "high contrast imaging investigations have similarly begun to discover gas giant exoplanets located at large orbital separations from their stars ( fomalhaut b , @xcite , @xmath13 pictoris b , @xcite ; hr 8799 bcde , @xcite ; @xmath14 and .",
    "b , @xcite ; 51 eri b , @xcite ; hd 100546 bc , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while most of these directly imaged gas giants surround early - type stars , detections have been reported around solar - analogs ( gj 504b , @xcite ) and dm stars ( e.g. roxs42b , @xcite ; gu psc , @xcite ) . yet",
    "the formation mechanisms responsible for these systems is still under debate . a growing number of objects with wide orbits and modest mass ratios ( eg . hd 106906b , @xcite ; roxs42bb , @xcite ; 1rxsj1609 , @xcite ; 2 m j044144 , @xcite ) have led to suggestions that the planetary companion formed via a binary star - like process rather than the core accretion process ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although binary stars are common ( e.g. @xcite ) , our understanding of the frequency of exoplanets around binaries and higher order systems remains limited .",
    "since the discovery of the first exoplanet surrounding a binary host ( kepler-16b , @xcite ) , less than a dozen similar systems have been discovered by kepler ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the analysis of publicly available kepler data led @xcite to conclude that the frequency of planets with r @xmath15 6r@xmath12 on periods of less than 300 days was similar to that of single star rates ; however , this conclusion is critically dependent on the assumed planetary inclination distribution .",
    "while at least one bona fide planetary mass companion orbiting a binary has been imaged ( roxs 42bb * ? ? ?",

    "* ) most dedicated direct imaging surveys for gas giant planets around binaries have not yielded any firm detections to - date @xcite .",

    "vhs 1256 b is a particularly unique object .",
    "its near - infrared properties resemble those of the hr 8799 planets and a select few other young ( t @xmath20 30 myr ) and very low mass ( m @xmath20 15 @xmath21 ) substellar objects , occupying roughly the same near - infrared color - magnitude space @xcite : a continuation of the l dwarf sequence to fainter magnitudes and cooler temperatures . indeed , as shown by atmosphere modeling , the near - infrared properties of objects like hr 8799 bcde and 2 m 1207 b reveal evidence for thicker clouds than field brown dwarfs of the same effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "vhs 1256 b then offers a probe of clouds at ages intermediate between these benchmark objects and gyr - old field objects and thus some insights into the atmospheric evolution of low - mass substellar objects .",

    "second , we utilized advanced psf subtraction methods and a different approach with image combination to compensate for the shorter integration time and brighter sky background in @xmath1 and obtained slightly deeper limits in @xmath0 .",
    "we use a - loci as in @xcite with a large optimization area ( 500 psf footprints ) and rotation gap ( 1.5 times the diffraction limit at l@xmath22 and m@xmath27 ) combined with a moving pixel mask to flatten the background without removing signal from vhs 1256 b. as vhs 1256 b is located about 8 from the primary , even a small 2@xmath26.8 parallactic motion is sufficient to apply psf subtraction methods like loci @xcite ] .",
    "we then applied a 4 @xmath28/d spatial filter and combined the derotated data to obtain a mean image using a 3-@xmath29 outlier rejection .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a higher signal - to - noise detection of vhs 1256 b , which was barely detectable in @xmath1 at the 3-@xmath29 level using the first image processing method , obtaining about a 40% deeper background limit at @xmath0 .",
    "we utilized observations of the @xmath30 standard fs 138 @xcite obtained on 2015 june 7 using ngs and observations of the @xmath31 standard hr 5384 @xcite obtained on 2015 june 8 without ao to transform our photometry to a standard system .",
    "we did not obtain successful images of a dense stellar cluster that would be needed to construct a robust distortion correction for our @xmath0and @xmath1 imagery ; hence , we have included no such correction to our data .",
    "our lack of a distortion correction introduces some uncertainty into vhs 1256 b s separation , but does not affect our other results .",
    "our fully reduced @xmath0- and @xmath1-band imagery ( figure [ fig : l_m ] ) clearly reveals the presence of both the composite source of vhs 1256 a and b ( a+b ) and vhs 1256 b reported by @xcite .",
    "we detect the companion at snr @xmath2 130 ( 100 ) in the @xmath0 data and at 4.5 ( 3 ) in the @xmath1 data using the a - loci ( classical ) reduction , where the latter detection is roughly comparable to the detection significance of hr 8799 bcd in @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath1 imagery do not provide stringent constraints on the presence of additional point sources compared to the @xmath0imagery .",
    "it is apparent from visual inspection of figure [ fig : l_m ] that the vhs 1256 a+b is much more elongated in both @xmath0and @xmath1 -bands than vhs 1256 b. in fact , simple gaussian fits to the data reveal that the fwhm of the central star is significantly broader than the companion in both band - passes .",
    "zooming in on the region around vhs 1256 a+b , figure [ fig : contour ] demonstrates that the central star is comprised of two marginally resolved sources . using a modified elliptical least squares minimization fitting routine written by nicky van foreest",
    ", we compute the average ellipticity ( e = ( ( a@xmath36 - b@xmath36)/a@xmath36)@xmath37 ) ) of our sources .",
    "the average ellipticity of the central star , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the @xmath0and @xmath1 bands respectively , is significantly greater than the average ellipticity observed for the companion ( @xmath40 in @xmath0 ) .",
    "these results all indicate that the central star is clearly comprised of the superposition of two separate sources .    to help ascertain the probability that the observed multiplicity of vhs 1256 a and b arises from chance alignment of vhs 1256 with a background source , we utilize archival wise w1-band imagery , which has a similar band - pass as our @xmath0-band imagery .",

    "note that our @xmath0and @xmath1 vhs 1256 b photometry improves on the respective wise w1 and w2 errors previously presented .    the relative astrometry and flux of vhs 1256 a and b were constrained by fitting a linear combination of two psfs to our @xmath43 images",
    "; we adopt vhs 1256 b as the psf .",
    "we first align the dithered images of the central binary by maximizing their cross - correlation and then combine them by averaging . averaging the frames",
    "is optimal in the case of gaussian errors ; in our case , it reduces the noise by nearly a factor of 2 compared with a median combination .",
    "we use bicubic spline interpolation to translate the psf of vhs 1256 b. we then simultaneously adjust the positions and normalizations of two psfs to minimize @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the variance from photon noise and @xmath46 is the variance from read noise and the thermal background .",
    "we estimate @xmath47 from the instrument gain and measure @xmath46 from empty regions of the image .",
    "the variance is the sum of variance in the image and scaled variance from the noisy companion psf . in practice ,",
    "most of the noise arises from scaling the companion psf , as the noise increases linearly with the scaling factors .",

    "spatial correlations in the noise are visible in the residual image even far from the psf core ; it is these correlations that force us to scale our errors .",
    "a full treatment of the problem would modify @xmath50 ( equation [ eq : chi2 ] ) to account for the data s non - diagonal covariance matrix .",

    "we thus obtain 1@xmath57 measurements of the relative photometry and separation .",
    "the discovery work by @xcite suggested that vhs 1256 b , based on its spectral shape and color - magnitude diagram position , is a red l / t transition object similar to hr 8799 bcde ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . with sed information spanning the red optical to mid - infrared , we can more thoroughly compare vhs 1256 b s properties to those of other substellar objects and fit atmosphere models with a range of assumptions about clouds to reproduce vhs1256 b s spectrum .",
    "many free floating l / t dwarfs with red optical to near - infrared photometry and spectra have been studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , even considering young brown dwarfs as well as the field , vhs 1256 b occupies an extremely sparsely populated near - infrared color - magnitude diagram position shared by planet mass objects like hr 8799 bcde and 2 m 1207 b @xcite .",

    "* sect 6.2 of this work ) .    while the similarity of vhs 1256 b s near - infrared colors to those of hr 8799 bcde suggest that their atmospheric properties likewise share some similarity ( e.g. perhaps thick clouds ) , the addition of thermal infrared data in this work allows us to further quantify this feature and assess whether or not vhs 1256 b shows clear evidence for non - equilibrium carbon chemistry .",
    "compared to hr 8799 bcde , vhs 1256 b s available suite of photometry extends far bluer , into the optical .",
    "thus , the companion provides a new test of atmospheric models used to reproduce at least some bona fide directly - imaged planets .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , young l dwarfs tend to follow a reddened version of the field sequence . comparing vhs 1256 a+b s colors to those of the field sequence and young associations like ab dor",

    "we perform atmospheric forward modeling to estimate vhs 1256 b s temperature , surface gravity , and radius , and to see if its photometry can be reproduced by atmospheric models in chemical equilibrium .",
    "we follow the studies of @xcite and @xcite for hr 8799 s planets and @xcite for field brown dwarfs , comparing the data with atmosphere models from a. burrows covering a range of parameterized cloud prescriptions but all assuming chemical equilibrium .",

    "we detected no other point source companions in our field of view ( fov ) , @xmath216@xmath45 x @xmath216@xmath45 in @xmath0and @xmath29@xmath43 x @xmath29@xmath43 in @xmath1 , down to our 5-@xmath29 sensitivity limits shown in figure [ fig : lims ] .",
    "of 13.2 ( @xmath0 ; 12.5 mag at 17.1 pc ) . assuming a distance of 12.7 ( 17.1 ) @xmath9 , minimum system age of @xmath15 400 ( 200 ) myr , and no flux reversal at @xmath0 ( i.e. that more massive objects are fainter )",
    ", we can therefore exclude the presence of additional companions more massive than vhs 1256 b beyond 6 ( 8) au . for most of the semi",
    "major axis space we probe , comparisons with @xcite imply that companions down to 35 @xmath21 can be excluded if the system is 200400 @xmath58 old .    because we have failed to identify other substellar companions orbiting the primary ,",
    "this severely restricts the possibility that vhs 1256 b was scattered to its present orbit by dynamical interactions with another , unseen planet .",
    "thus far , searches for close - in substellar companions to stars with imaged ( near ) planet - mass companions at 100500 au have failed to identify potential scatterers , suggesting that this class of objects formed in situ either from protostellar disk or molecular cloud fragmentation @xcite .",
    "furthremore , the mass ratio ( q ) of vhs 1256 b ( m@xmath218.4 m@xmath3 ; median lower limit between 10.2 - 26.2 m@xmath3 ) to vhs 1256 a+b ( m@xmath77116 @xmath10 ) is @xmath20.16 .",
    "this mass ratio is substantially larger than that observed for other imaged planetary systems such as hr 8799 ( q @xmath2 @xmath78 ; @xcite ) and roxs 42b ( q @xmath2 0.008 - 0.01 ; @xcite ) .",
    "rather , it is more similar to that observed for low mass bds ( q @xmath2 0.01 - 0.9 ; eg .",
    "see figure 4 , @xcite and citations there in ) .",
    "we suggest this is indicative that the system formed via some form of fragmentation , i.e. a binary - star - like formation mechanism , rather than core accretion @xcite .",
    "stone et al .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion of the binary - star - like formation .",
    "although vhs 1256 b occupies a similar near - ir color - magnitude space to hr 8799 bcde @xcite , its significantly older age than the hr 8799 system enables one to probe a different time frame in planet / brown dwarf atmospheric evolution .",
    "vhs 1256 b and hr 8799 bcd(e ? ) have different spectral energy distributions at the longest wavelengths probe ( @xmath1/4.7 @xmath7 ) . in the now - standard picture of understanding the atmospheres of the youngest and lowest - mass l / t objects , thick clouds and non - equilibrium carbon chemistry both",
    "are due to the objects low surface gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that vhs 1256 b thus far lacks evidence for non - equilibrium carbon chemistry may complicate this picture , suggesting some decoupling of gravity s two effects or that vhs 1256 b s gravity is high enough that non - equilibrium effects are less obvious than they are for , say , hr 8799 b.    higher signal - to - noise detections in @xmath1 and photometry in the 34 @xmath7 range probing methane will allow us to better clarify vhs 1256 b s carbon chemistry .",
    "multiple lines in @xmath79 band resolvable at medium resolution could better clarify the companion s surface gravity .",
    "with other , similar objects detected at a range of ages , we can better map out the atmospheric evolution of objects of a given mass as well as the diversity of objects occupying the same reddened l / t transition region where vhs 1256 b and bona fide planets like hr 8799 bcde reside .",
    "the vhs 1256 hierarchical triple system is poised to become an important contributor to our understanding of vlm systems .",
    "it represents the third hierarchical triple system comprised solely of brown dwarf - mass components known @xcite .",
    "given this projected separation ( 1.3 au ) and associated approximate orbital period ( @xmath24.7 years ) of the central binary in vhs 1256 , future ao spectroscopic monitoring of the system is poised to determine dynamical masses of all components of the triple system , which should help constrain evolutionary models ( see e.g. @xcite ) . since at least some brown dwarf binaries are believed to form via the disintegration of triple systems , and the third body in such systems are most likely also brown dwarf mass object @xcite , robustly determining the fundamental properties of the few known triple systems like vhs 1256 could help test the predictions of dynamical simulations of bd formation and evolution .",
