    "the detection of diffuse synchrotron emission ( radio halos ) on mpc scales in an increasing number of galaxy clusters provides good evidence for a distributed magnetic field of @xmath0gauss strength in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ; see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "imaging of faraday rotation of linearly - polarized radio emission from embedded and background sources confirms that there are fields associated with thermal plasma along lines of sight through the clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) . observations of faraday rotation can also be made for radio galaxies in sparser environments , allowing the study of magnetic fields in environments too sparse for radio halos to be detected ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the faraday effect @xcite is the rotation suffered by linearly polarized radiation travelling through a magnetized medium , and can be described by the two following relations : @xmath1}= \\psi(\\lambda)_{[{\\rm rad}]}~-~\\psi_{0~[{\\rm        rad}]}=\\lambda^2 _ { [ { \\rm m}^2]}~{\\rm rm}_{[{\\rm rad\\,m}^{-2}]},\\ ] ] with @xmath2}=812\\int_{0}^{l_{[{\\rm kpc}]}}n_{\\rm{e}~[{\\rm        cm}^{-3}]}b_{z~[\\mu{\\rm g}]}dz_{[{\\rm kpc}]}\\ , , \\label{equarm}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the @xmath5-vector position angle of linearly polarized radiation observed at wavelength @xmath6 and the intrinsic angle , respectively , @xmath7 is the electron gas density , @xmath8 is the magnetic field along the line - of - sight ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is the integration path .",
    "rm is the _ rotation measure_.    observations of faraday rotation variations across extended radio galaxies allow us to derive information about the integral of the density - weighted line - of - sight field component .",
    "the hot ( @xmath11k ) plasma emits in the x - ray energy band via thermal bremsstrahlung . when high quality x - ray data for a radio - source environment is available , it is possible to infer the gas density distribution and therefore to separate it from that of the magnetic field , subject to some assumptions about the relation of field strength and density .",
    "most of the rm images of radio galaxies published so far show patchy structures with no clear preferred direction , consistent with isotropic foreground fluctuations over a range of linear scales ranging from tens of kpc to @xmath12100pc ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "numerical modelling has demonstrated that this type of complex rm structure can be accurately reproduced if the magnetic field is randomly variable with fluctuations on a wide range of spatial scales , and is spread throughout the whole group or cluster environment ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "these authors used forward modelling , together with estimators of the spatial statistics of the rm distributions ( structure and autocorrelation functions or a multi - scale statistic ) to estimate the field strength , its relation to the gas density and its power spectrum .",
    "the technique of bayesian maximum likelihood has also been used for this purpose @xcite .    in order to derive the three - dimensional magnetic field power spectrum , all of these authors had to assume statistical isotropy for the field , since only the component of the magnetic field along",
    "the line - of - sight contributes to the observed rm .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the absence of a preferred direction in most of the rm images .",
    "in contrast , the present paper reports on _ anisotropic _ rm structures , observed in lobed radio galaxies located in different environments , ranging from a small group to one of the richest clusters of galaxies .",
    "the rm images of radio galaxies presented in this paper show clearly anisotropic `` banded '' patterns over part or all of their areas . in some sources ,",
    "these banded patterns coexist with regions of isotropic random variations .",
    "the magnetic field responsible for these rm patterns must , therefore , have a preferred direction .",
    "one source whose rm structure is dominated by bands is already known : m84 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is some evidence for rm bands in sources which also show strong irregular fluctuations , such as cygnusa @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that some of the claimed bands could be due to imperfect sampling of an isotropic rm distribution with large - scale power , and we return to this question in section  [ many ] .",
    "the present paper presents new rm images of three sources which show spectacular banded structures , together with improved data for m84 .",
    "the environments of all four sources are well characterized by modern x - ray observations , and we give the first comprehensive description of the banded rm phenomenon .",
    "we present an initial attempt to interpret the phenomenon as a consequence of source - environment interactions and to understand the difference between it and the more usual irregular rm structure .",
    "the rm images reported in this paper are derived from new or previously unpublished archive very large array ( vla ) data for the nearby radio galaxies 0206 + 35 , m84 @xcite , 3c270 @xcite and 3c353 ( swain , private communication ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section[sec : data ] the radio and x - ray properties of the sources under investigation are presented and in section[sec : teq ] we briefly summarize the techniques used to analyse depolarization and two - dimensional variations of rm .",
    "sections[sec : rm ] and [ dp ] present the rm and depolarization images on which our analysis is based and correlations between the two quantities . in section[sec : sfunc ] , we evaluate the rm structure functions in regions where the fluctuations appear to be isotropic and derive the power spectra .",
    "a simple model of the source - environment interaction which characterises the effects of compression of a magnetised igm is described in section  [ model ] .",
    "this can produce rm bands , but only under implausible special initial conditions .",
    "empirical `` draped '' field configurations which are able to reproduce the banded rm distributions are investigated in section[drap ] . in section[discuss ] , we speculate on correlations between radio source morphology , and rm anisotropy , discuss other examples from the literature , consider the effects of an isotropic foreground faraday screen on the detectability of rm bands and briefly discuss possible asymmetries in the amplitude of the rm bands between the approaching and receding lobes .",
    "finally , section[concl ] summarizes our conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 = 71 km s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 = 0.3 , and @xmath17 = 0.7 .",
    "high quality radio and x - ray data are available for all of the sources . in this section",
    "we summarize those of their observational properties which are relevant to our rm study . a list of the sources and their general parameters is given in table[propradio ] , while table[propx ] shows the x - ray parameters taken from the literature and equipartition parameters derived from our radio observations .",
    "the sources were observed with the vla at several frequencies , in full polarization mode and with multiple configurations so that the radio structure is well sampled .",
    "the vla observations , data reduction and detailed descriptions of the radio structures are given for 0206 + 35 and m84 by @xcite , for 3c270 by @xcite , and for 3c353 by @xcite .",
    "all of the radio maps show a core , two sided jets and a double - lobed structure with sharp brightness gradients at the leading edges of both lobes .",
    "the synchrotron minimum pressures are all significantly lower than the thermal pressures of the external medium ( table[propx ] ) .",
    "all of the sources have been observed in the soft x - ray band by more than one satellite , allowing the detection of multiple components on cluster / group and sub - galactic scales .",
    "the x - ray morphologies are characterized by a compact source surrounded by extended emission with low surface brightness .",
    "the former includes a non - thermal contribution , from the core and the inner regions of the radio jets and , in the case of 0206 + 35 and 3c270 , a thermal component which is well fitted by a small core radius @xmath18 model .",
    "the latter component is associated with the diffuse intra - group or intra - cluster medium .",
    "parameters for all of the thermal components , derived from x - ray observations , are listed in table[propx ] . because of the irregular morphology of the hot gas surrounding 3c353 and m84 , it has not been possible to fit @xmath18 models to their x - ray radial surface brightness profiles .",

    "the most obvious feature of this image ( fig .",

    "for the same reason , the apparent minimum in @xmath54 at the centre of the deep , negative rm band ( fig .",

    "the averaged values of @xmath54 for 0206 + 35 are already very low , however , and are likely to be slightly overestimated , so residual rm fluctuations on scales below the 1.2-arcsec beamwidth must be very small .",

    "it is clear from the fact that the observed rm bands are perpendicular to the lobe axes that they must be associated with an interaction between an expanding radio source and the gas immediately surrounding it .",
    "one inevitable mechanism is enhancement of field and density by the shock or compression wave surrounding the source .. ] the implication of the presence of cavities in the x - ray gas distribution coincident with the radio lobes is that the sources are interacting strongly with the thermal gas , displacing rather than mixing with it ( see @xcite for a review ) . for the sources in the present paper , the x - ray observations of m84 ( * ? ? ?",

    "regardless of the strength of the shock , the field is modified so that only the component in the plane of the shock is amplified and the post - shock field tends become ordered parallel to the shock surface .",
    "the evidence so far suggests that shocks around radio sources of both fr classes are generally weak ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are only two examples in which highly supersonic expansion has been inferred : the southern lobe of centaurusa ( @xmath93 ; @xcite ) and ngc3801 ( @xmath94 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is no evidence that the sources described in the present paper are significantly overpressured compared with the surrounding igm ( indeed , the synchrotron minimum pressure is systematically lower than the thermal pressure of the igm ; table [ propx ] ) .",
    "the sideways expansion of the lobes is therefore unlikely to be highly supersonic .",
    "the shock mach number estimated for all the sources from ram pressure balance in the forward direction is also @xmath44  1.3 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with that for m84 made by @xcite and also with the lack of detection of strong shocks in the x - ray data for the other sources .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate how the rm could be affected by compression .",
    "we consider a deliberately oversimplified picture in which the radio source expands into an igm with an initially uniform magnetic field , @xmath95 .",
    "this is the most favourable situation for the generation of large - scale , anisotropic rm structures : in reality , the pre - existing field is likely to be highly disordered , or even isotropic , because of turbulence in the thermal gas .",
    "_ we stress that we have not tried to generate a self - consistent model for the magnetic field and thermal density , but rather to illustrate the generic effects of compression on the rm structure_.    in this model the radio lobe is an ellipsoid with its major axis along the jet and is surrounded by a spherical shell of compressed material .",
    "this shell is centred at the mid - point of the lobe ( fig.[prova ] ) and has a stand - off distance equal to 1/3 of the lobe semi - major axis at the leading edge ( the radius of the spherical compression is therefore equal to 4/3 of the lobe semi - major axis ) . in the compressed region , the thermal density and the magnetic field component in the plane of the spherical compression are amplified by the same factor , because of flux - freezing .",

    "the same symbols with primes stand for post - shock quantities and @xmath114 is the compression factor .",
    "the total compressed magnetic field is : @xmath115 the field strength after compression depends on the the angle between the compression surface and the initial field .",
    "maximum amplification occurs for a field which is parallel to the surface , whereas a perpendicular field remains unchanged .",
    "the post - shock field component along the line - of - sight becomes : @xmath116    we assumed that the compression factor , @xmath117 , is a function of distance @xmath109 along the source axis from the centre of the radio lobe , decreasing monotonically from a maximum value @xmath118 at the leading edge to a constant value from the centre of the lobe as far as the core .",
    "we investigated values of @xmath118 in the range 1.5  4 ( @xmath119 corresponds to the asymptotic value for a strong shock ) .",
    "given that there is no evidence for strong shocks in the x - ray data for any of our sources , we have typically assumed that the compression factor is @xmath120 at the front end of the lobe , decreasing to 1.2 at the lobe mid - point and thereafter remaining constant as far as the core .",
    "a maximum compression factor of 3 is consistent with the transonic mach numbers @xmath121 estimated from ram - pressure balance for all of the sources and this choice is also motivated by the x - ray data of m84 , from which there is evidence for a compression ratio @xmath122 between the shells and their surroundings ( section[84 ] ) .",
    "we produced synthetic rm images for different combinations of source inclination and direction of the pre - existing uniform field , by integrating the expression @xmath123 numerically .",
    "we assumed a constant value of @xmath124cm@xmath36 for the density of the pre - shock material ( the central value for the group gas associated with 0206 + 35 ; table  [ propx ] ) , a lobe semi - major axis of 21kpc ( also appropriate for 0206 + 35 ) and an initial field strength of 1@xmath0 g .",
    "the integration limits were defined by the surface of the radio lobe and the compression surface .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that there is no thermal gas within the radio lobe , consistent with the picture suggested by our inference of foreground faraday rotation and the existence of x - ray cavities and that faraday rotation from uncompressed gas is negligible .",
    "as an example , fig.[icm ] shows the effects of compression on the rm for the receding lobe of a source inclined by 40to the line of sight .",
    "the initial field is pointing towards us with an inclination of 60with respect to the line - of - sight ; its projection on the plane of the sky makes an angle of 30with the @xmath98-axis .",
    "fig.[icm](a ) displays the rm produced without compression ( @xmath126 everywhere ) : the rm structures are due only to differences in path length across the lobe .",
    "fig.[icm](b ) shows the consequence of adding a modest compression of @xmath127 : structures similar to bands are generated at the front end of the lobe and the range of the rm values is increased .",
    "fig.[icm](c ) illustrates the rm produced in case of the strongest possible compression , @xmath128 : the rm structure is essentially the same as in fig.[icm](b ) , with a much larger range .",
    "this very simple example shows that rm bands with amplitudes consistent with those observed can plausibly be produced even by weak shocks in the igm , but the iso - rm contours are neither straight , nor orthogonal to the lobe axis and there are no reversals .",
    "these constraints require specific initial conditions , as illustrated in fig.[90 ] , where we show the rm for a lobe in the plane of the sky .",
    "we considered three initial field configurations : along the line - of - sight ( fig.[90]a ) , in the plane of the sky and parallel to the lobe axis ( fig.[90]b ) and in the plane of the sky , but inclined by 45to the lobe axis ( fig.[90]c ) .",
    "the case closest to reproducing the observations is that displayed in fig.[90](b ) , in which reversals and well defined and straight bands perpendicular to the jet axis are produced for both of the lobes . in fig.[90](a ) , the structures are curved , while in fig.[90](c ) the bands are perpendicular to the initial field direction , and therefore inclined with respect to the lobe axis .    for a source inclined by 40to the line of sight , we found structures similar to the observed bands only with an initial field in the plane of the sky and parallel to the axis in projection ( figs[40]a and b ; note that the synthetic rm images in this example have been made for each lobe separately , neglecting superposition ) .",
    "we can summarize the results of the spherical pure compression model as follows .    1",
    ".   an initial field with a component along the line - of - sight does not generate straight bands",
    "the bands are orthogonal to the direction of the initial field projected on the plane of the sky , so bands perpendicular to the lobe axis are only obtained with an initial field aligned with the radio jet in projection .",
    "the path length ( determined by the precise shape of the radio lobes ) has a second - order effect on the rm distribution ( compare figs.[icm]a and b ) .",
    "thus , a simple compression model can generate bands with amplitudes similar to those observed but reproducing their geometry requires implausibly special initial conditions , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "that the pre - existing field is uniform , close to the plane of the sky and aligned with the source axis in projection is implausible for obvious reasons :    1 .",
    "the pre - existing field can not know anything about either the radio - source geometry or our line - of - sight and 2 .",
    "observations of faraday rotation in other sources and the theoretical inference of turbulence in the igm both require disordered initial fields .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field must be aligned _ by _ rather than _ with _ the expansion of the radio source .",
    "indeed , the field configurations which generate straight bands look qualitatively like the `` draping '' model proposed by @xcite , for some angles to the line - of - sight .",
    "the analysis of sections[rm ] ,  [ dp ] and [ sec : sfunc ] suggests that the magnetic fields causing the rm bands are well - ordered , consistent with a stretching of the initial field that has erased much of the small - scale structure while amplifying the large - scale component .",
    "we next attempt to constrain the geometry of the resulting `` draped '' field .",
    "a proper calculation of the rm from a draped magnetic - field configuration @xcite is outside the scope of this paper , but we can start to understand the field geometry using some simple approximations in which the field lines are stretched along the source axis .",
    "we assumed initially that the field around the lobe is axisymmetric , with components along and radially outwards from the source axis , so that the rm pattern is independent of rotation about the axis .",
    "_ it is important to stress that such an axisymmetric field is not physical _ , as it requires a monopole and unnatural reversals , it is nevertheless a useful benchmark for features of the field geometry that are needed to account for the observed rm structure .",
    "we first considered field lines which are parabolae with a common vertex on the axis ahead of the lobe . for field strength and density both decreasing away from the vertex , we found that rm structures , with iso - contours similar to arcs , rather than bands , were generated only for the approaching lobe of an inclined source .",
    "such anisotropic rm structures were not produced in the receding lobes , nor for sources in the plane of the sky .",
    "indeed , in order to generate any narrow , transverse rm structures such as arcs or bands , the line - of - sight must pass through a foreground region in which the field lines show significant curvature , which occurs only for an approaching lobe in case of a parabolic field geometry .",
    "this suggested that we should consider field lines which are families of ellipses centred on the lobe , again with field strength and density decreasing away from the leading edge .",
    "this indeed produced rm structures in both lobes for any inclination , but the iso - rm contours were arcs , not straight lines . because of the non - physical nature of these axisymmetric field models , the resulting rm images are deliberately not shown in this paper . in order to quantify the departures from straightness of the iso - rm contours , we measured the ratio of the predicted rm values at the centre and edge of the lobe at constant @xmath108 , at different distances along the source axis , @xmath129 , for both of the example axisymmetric field models .",
    "the ratio , which is 1 for perfectly straight bands , varies from 2 to 3 in both cases , depending on distance from the nucleus .",
    "this happens because the variations in line - of - sight field strength and density do not compensate accurately for changes in path length .",
    "we believe that this problem is generic to any axisymmetric field configuration .",
    "+ the results of this section suggest that the field configuration required to generate straight rm bands perpendicular to the projected lobe advance direction has systematic curvature in the field lines ( in order to produce a modulation in rm ) without a significant dependence on azimuthal angle around the source axis ) .",
    "we therefore investigated a structure in which elliptical field lines are wrapped around the front of the lobe , but in a two - dimensional rather than a three - dimensional configuration .",
    "we considered a field with a two - dimensional geometry , in which the field lines are families of ellipses in planes of constant @xmath108 , as sketched in fig.[famab ] .",
    "the field structure is then independent of @xmath108 .",
    "the limits of integration are given by the lobe surface and an ellipse whose major axis is 4/3 of that of the lobe .",
    "three example rm images are shown in fig .",
    "[ synfam ] . the assumed density ( @xmath130cm@xmath36 ) and magnetic field ( 1@xmath0 g )",
    "were the same as the pre - shock values for the compression model of section  [ model ] and the lobe semi - major axis was again 21kpc .",
    "since the effect of path length is very small ( section  [ model ] ) , the rm is also independent of @xmath108 to a good approximation .",
    "the combination of elliptical field lines and invariance with @xmath108 allows us to produce straight rm bands perpendicular to the projected lobe axis for any source inclination .",
    "furthermore , this model generates more significant reversals of the rm ( e.g.  fig.[synfam]c ) than those obtainable with pure compression ( e.g.  fig.[40]b ) .",
    "we conclude that a field model of this generic type represents the simplest way to produce rm bands with the observed characteristics in a way that does not require improbable initial conditions .",
    "the invariance of the field with the @xmath108 coordinate is an essential point of this model , suggesting that the physical process responsible for the draping and stretching of the field lines must act on scales larger than the radio lobes in the @xmath108 direction .",
    "the two - dimensional draped field illustrated in the previous section reproduces the geometry of the observed rm bands very well , but can only generate a single reversal , which must be very close to the front end of the approaching lobe , where the elliptical field lines bend most rapidly .",
    "we observe a prominent reversal in the receding lobe of 0206 + 35 ( fig .",
    "[ rm]a ) and multiple reversals across the eastern lobe of 3c353 and in m84 ( fig .",
    "[ rm]b and d ) .",
    "the simplest way to reproduce these is to assume that the draped field also has reversals , presumably originating from a more complex initial field in the igm .",
    "one realization of such a field configuration would be in the form of multiple toroidal eddies with radii smaller than the lobe size , as sketched in fig.[circle ] . whatever the precise field geometry , we stress that the straightness of the observed multiple bands again requires a two - dimensional structure , with little dependence on @xmath108 .",
    "the majority of published rm images of radio galaxies do not show bands or other kind of anisotropic structure , but are characterized by isotropic and random rm distributions ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we have presented observations of rm bands in four radio galaxies embedded in different environments and with a range of jet inclinations with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "our sources are not drawn from a complete sample , so any quantitative estimate of the incidence of bands is premature , but we can draw some preliminary conclusions .    the simple two - dimensional draped - field model developed in section  [ 2d ] only generates rm bands when the line - of - sight intercepts the volume containing elliptical field lines , which happens for a restricted range of rotation around the source axis . at other orientations , the rm from this field configuration will be small and the observed rm may well be dominated by material at larger distances which has not been affected by the radio source .",
    "we therefore expect a minority of sources with this type of field structure to show rm bands and the remainder to have weaker , and probably isotropic , rm fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the three - dimensional draped field model proposed by @xcite predicts rm bands _",
    "parallel _ to the source axis for a significant range of viewing directions : these have not ( yet ) been observed .",
    "the prominent rm bands described in the present paper occur only in _",
    "lobed _ radio galaxies .",
    "in contrast , well - observed radio sources with tails and plumes seem to be free of bands or anisotropic rm structure ( e.g. 3c31 , 3c449 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the lobes which show bands are all quite round and show evidence for interaction with the surrounding igm .",
    "it is particularly striking that the bands in 3c353 occur only in its eastern , rounded , lobe .",
    "the implication is that rm bands occur when a lobe is being actively driven by a radio jet into a region of high igm density .",
    "plumes and tails , on the other hand , are likely to be rising buoyantly in the group or cluster and we do not expect significant compression , at least at large distances from the nucleus .      the fact that rm bands have so far been observed only in a few radio sources may be a selection effect : much rm analysis has been carried out for galaxy clusters , in which most of the sources are tailed ( e.g. @xcite ) . with a few exceptions like cyga ( see below , section  [ cyg ] ) , lobed fri and frii sources have not been studied in detail .",
    "cygnusa is a source in which we might expect to observed rm bands , by analogy with the sources discussed in the present paper : it has wide and round lobes and _ chandra _ x - ray data have shown the presence of shock - heated gas and cavities @xcite .",
    "rm bands , roughly perpendicular to the source axis , are indeed seen in both lobes @xcite , but interpretation is complicated by the larger random rm fluctuations and the strong depolarization in the eastern lobe .",
    "a semi - circular rm feature around one of the hot - spots in the western lobe has been attributed to compression by the bow - shock @xcite .",
    "@xcite have claimed evidence for rm bands in the northern lobe of hydraa .",
    "image @xcite shows a clear cavity with sharp edges coincident with the radio lobes and an absence of shock - heated gas , just as in our sources . despite the classification as a tailed source",
    ", it may well be that there is significant compression of the igm .",
    "note , however , that the rm image is not well sampled close to the nucleus .",
    "the rm image of the tailed source 3c465 published by @xcite shows some evidence for bands , but the colour scale was deliberately chosen to highlight the difference between positive and negative values , thus making it difficult to see the large gradients in rm expected at band edges .",
    "the original rm image ( eilek , private communication ) suggests that the band in the western tail of 3c465 is similar to those we have identified .",
    "it is plausible that magnetic - field draping happens in wide - angle tail sources like 3c465 as a result of bulk motion of the igm within the cluster potential well , as required to bend the tails .",
    "it will be interesting to search for rm bands in other sources of this type and to find out whether there is any relation between the iso - rm contours and the flow direction of the igm .",

    "the cross represents the radio core position . ,",
    "width=226 ]      the coexistence in the rm images of our sources of anisotropic patterns with areas of isotropic fluctuations suggests that the faraday - rotating medium has at least two components : one local to the source , where its motion significantly affects the surrounding medium , draping the field , and the other from material on group or cluster scales which has not felt the effects of the source .",
    "this raises the possibility that turbulence in the foreground faraday rotating medium might `` wash out '' rm bands , thereby making them impossible to detect .",
    "the isotropic rm fluctuations observed across our sources are all described by quite flat power spectra with low amplitude ( table[spectrum ] ) .",
    "the random small - scale structure of the field along the line - of - sight essentially averages out , and there is very little power on scales comparable with the bands . if , on the other hand , the isotropic field had a steeper power spectrum with significant power on scales similar to the bands , then its contribution might become dominant .",
    "we first produced synthetic rm images for 0206 + 35 including a random component derived from our best - fitting power spectrum ( table[spectrum ] ) in order to check that the bands remained visible .",
    "we assumed a minimum scale of 2kpc from the depolarization analysis for 0206 + 35 ( sec.[dp ] ) , and a maximum scale of @xmath131kpc , consistent with the continuing rise of the rm structure function at the largest sampled separations , which requires @xmath132arcsec ( @xmath4720kpc ) .",
    "the final synthetic rm is given by : @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the rm due to the draped and isotropic fields , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath136 and @xmath137 are respectively the density and field component along the line - of - sight in the draped region .",
    "the integration limits of the term @xmath134 were defined by the surface of the lobe and the draped region , while that of the term @xmath135 starts at the surface of the draped region and extends to 3 times the core radius of the x - ray gas ( table[propx ] ) . for the electron gas density @xmath111 outside the draped region we assumed the beta - model profile of 0206 + 35 ( table[propx ] ) and for the field strength a radial variation of the form ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath138^{~\\eta}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the rms magnetic field strength at the group centre .",
    "we took a draped magnetic field strength of 1.8@xmath0 g , in order to match the amplitudes for the rm bands in both lobes of 0206 + 35 , and assumed the same value for @xmath139 .",
    "example rm images , shown in figs.[drapicm](a ) and ( b ) , should be compared with those for the draped field alone ( figs.[synfam]b and c , scaled up by a factor of 1.8 to account for the difference in field strength ) and with the observations ( fig.[rm]a ) after correction for galactic foreground ( table[band ] ) .",
    "the model is self - consistent : the flat power spectrum found for 0206 + 35 does not give coherent rm structure which could interfere with the rm bands , which are still visible .",
    "we then replaced the isotropic component with one having a kolmogorov power spectrum ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "we assumed identical minimum and maximum scales ( 2 and 40kpc ) as for the previous power spectrum and took the same central field strength ( @xmath139=1.8@xmath0 g ) and radial variation ( eq.[br ] ) .",
    "example realizations are shown in fig.[drapicm](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the bands are essentially invisible in the presence of foreground rm fluctuations with a steep power spectrum out to scales larger than their widths .",
    "it may therefore be that the rm bands in our sources are especially prominent because the power spectra for the isotropic rm fluctuations have unusually low amplitudes and flat slopes .",
    "we have established these parameters directly for 0206 + 35 , 3c270 and 3c353 ; m84 is only 14kpc in size and is located far from the core of the virgo cluster , so it is plausible that the cluster contribution to its rm is small and constant .",
    "we conclude that the detection of rm bands could be influenced by the relative amplitude and scale of the fluctuations of the isotropic and random rm component compared with that from any draped field , and that significant numbers of banded rm structures could be masked by isotropic components with steep power spectra .",
    "the well - established correlation between rm variance and/or depolarization and jet sidedness observed in fri and frii radio sources is interpreted as an orientation effect : the lobe containing the brighter jet is on the near side , and is seen through less magnetoionic material ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for sources showing rm bands , it is interesting to ask whether the asymmetry is due to the bands or just to the isotropic component .    in 0206 + 35 ,",
    "whose jets are inclined by @xmath44  40to the line - of - sight , the large negative band on the receding side has the highest rm ( fig.[rmprof ] ) .",
    "this might suggest that the rm asymmetry is due to the bands , and therefore to the local draped field . unfortunately",
    ", 0206 + 35 is the only source displaying this kind of asymmetry .",
    "the other `` inclined '' source , m84 , ( @xmath141  60 ) does not show such asymmetry : on the contrary the rm amplitude is quite symmetrical . in this case , however , the relation between the ( well - constrained ) inclination of the inner jets , and that of the lobes could be complicated : both jets bend by @xmath44  90at distances of about 50arcsec from the nucleus @xcite , so that we can not establish the real orientation of the lobes with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "the low values of the jet / counter - jet ratios in 3c270 and 3c353 suggest that their axes are close to the plane of the sky , so that little orientation - dependent rm asymmetry would be expected . indeed , the lobes of 3c270 show similar rm amplitudes , while the large asymmetry of rm profile of 3c353 is almost certainly due to a higher column density of thermal gas in front of the eastern lobe . within our small sample ,",
    "there is therefore no convincing evidence for higher rm amplitudes in the bands on the receding side , but neither can such an effect be ruled out .    in models in which an ordered field is draped around the radio lobes ,",
    "the magnitude of any rm asymmetry depends on the field geometry as well as the path length ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the isotropic case ) .",
    "for instance , the case illustrated in figs  [ synfam](b ) and ( c ) shows very little asymmetry even for @xmath107=  40 .",
    "the presence of a systematic asymmetry in the banded rm component could therefore be used to constrain the geometry .",
    "a different mechanism for the generation of rm fluctuations was suggested by @xcite .",
    "they argued that large - scale nonlinear surface waves could form on the surface of a radio lobe through the merging of smaller waves generated by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and showed that rm s of roughly the observed magnitude would be produced if a uniform field inside the lobe was advected into the mixing layer .",
    "this mechanism is unlikely to be able to generate large - scale bands , however : the predicted iso - rm contours are only straight over parts of the lobe which are locally flat , even in the unlikely eventuality that a coherent surface wave extends around the entire lobe .    the idea that a mixing layer generates high faraday rotation may instead be relevant to the anomalously high depolarizations associated with regions of compressed gas around the inner radio lobes of m84 and 3c270 ( section  [ dp ] and fig .",
    "we have argued that the fields responsible for the depolarization are tangled on small scales , since they produce depolarization without any obvious effects on the large - scale faraday rotation pattern .",
    "it is unclear whether the level of turbulence within the shells of compressed gas is sufficient to amplify and tangle a pre - existing field in the igm to the level that it can produce the observed depolarization ; a plausible alternative is that the field originates within the radio lobe and mixes with the surrounding thermal gas .",
    "in this work we have analysed and interpreted the faraday rotation across the lobed radio galaxies 0206 + 35 , 3c270 , 3c353 and m84 , located in environments ranging from a poor group to one of the richest clusters of galaxies ( the virgo cluster ) .",
    "the rm images have been produced at resolutions ranging from 1.2 to 5.5arcsec fwhm using very large array data at multiple frequencies .",
    "all of the rm images show peculiar banded patterns across the radio lobes , implying that the magnetic fields responsible for the faraday rotation are anisotropic .",
    "the rm bands coexist and contrast with areas of patchy and random fluctuations , whose power spectra have been estimated using a structure - function technique .",
    "we have also analysed the variation of degree of polarization with wavelength and compared this with the predictions for the best - fitting rm power spectra in order to constrain the minimum scale of magnetic turbulence .",
    "we have investigated the origin of the bands by making synthetic rm images using simple models of the interaction between radio galaxies and the surrounding medium and have estimated the geometry and strength of the magnetic field .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the lack of deviation from @xmath50 rotation over a wide range of polarization position angle and the lack of associated depolarization together suggest that a foreground faraday screen with no mixing of radio - emitting and thermal electrons is responsible for the observed rm in the bands and elsewhere ( section  [ sec : rm ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the degree of polarization on wavelength is well fitted by a burn law , which is also consistent with ( mostly resolved ) pure foreground rotation ( section  [ dp ] ) .",
    "the rm bands are typically 3  10kpc wide and have amplitudes of 10  50radm@xmath73 ( table  [ band ] ) .",
    "the maximum deviations of rm from the galactic values are observed at the position of the bands .",
    "iso - rm contours are orthogonal to the axes of the lobes . in several cases ,",
    "neighbouring bands have opposite signs compared with the galactic value and the line - of - sight field component must therefore reverse between them .",
    "an analysis of the profiles of and depolarization along the source axes suggests that there is very little small - scale rm structure within the bands .",
    "5 .   the lobes against which bands are seen have unusually small axial ratios ( i.e.they appear round in projection ; fig .",
    "[ rm ] ) . in one source ( 3c353 )",
    "the two lobes differ significantly in axial ratio , and only the rounder one shows rm bands .",
    "this lobe is on the side of the source for which the external gas density is higher .",
    "structure function and depolarization analyses show that flat power - law power spectra with low amplitudes and high - frequency cut - offs are characteristic of the areas which show isotropic and random rm fluctuations , but no bands ( section  [ sec : sfunc ] ) . 7 .",
    "there is evidence for source - environment interactions , such as large - scale asymmetry ( 3c353 ) cavities and shells of swept - up and compressed material ( m84 , 3c270 ) in all three sources for which high - resolution x - ray imaging is available .",
    "areas of strong depolarization are found around the edges of the radio lobes close to the nuclei of 3c270 and m84 .",
    "these are probably associated with shells of compressed hot gas .",
    "the absence of large - scale changes in faraday rotation in these features suggests that the field must be tangled on small scales ( section  [ dp ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the amplitude of with that of the structure functions at the largest sampled separations is consistent with an amplification of the large scale magnetic field component at the position of the bands",
    "we produced synthetic rm images from radio lobes expanding into an ambient medium containing thermal material and magnetic field , first considering a pure compression of both thermal density and field , and then including three- and two - dimensional stretching ( `` draping '' ) of the field lines along the direction of the radio jets ( sects .",
    "[ model ] and [ drap ] ) .",
    "both of the mechanisms are able to generate anisotropic rm structure . 11 . to reproduce the straightness of the iso - rm contours ,",
    "a two - dimensional field structure is needed .",
    "in particular , a two - dimensional draped field , whose lines are geometrically described by a family of ellipses , and associated with compression , reproduces the rm bands routinely for any inclination of the sources to the line - of - sight ( sec .",
    "moreover , it might explain the high rm amplitude and low depolarization observed within the bands .",
    "the invariance of the magnetic field along the axis perpendicular to the forward expansion of the lobe suggests that the physical process responsible for the draping and stretching of the magnetic field must act on scales larger than the lobe itself in this direction .",
    "we can not yet constrain the scale size along the line of sight . 13 . in order to create rm bands with multiple reversals ,",
    "more complex field geometries such as two - dimensional eddies are needed ( section  [ helic ] ) .",
    "we have interpreted the observed rm s as due to two magnetic field components : one draped around the radio lobes to produce the rm bands , the other turbulent , spread throughout the surrounding medium , unaffected by the radio source and responsible for the isotropic and random rm fluctuations ( section  [ iso ] ) .",
    "we tested this model for 0206 + 35 , assuming a typical variation of field strength with radius in the group atmosphere , and found that a magnetic field with central strength of @xmath142 g reproduced the rm range quite well in both lobes .",
    "we have suggested two reasons for the low rate of detection of bands in published rm images : our line of sight will only intercept a draped field structure in a minority of cases and rotation by a foreground turbulent field with significant power on large scales may mask any banded rm structure .",
    "our results therefore suggest a more complex picture of the magnetoionic environments of radio galaxies than was apparent from earlier work .",
    "we find three distinct types of magnetic - field structure : an isotropic component with large - scale fluctuations , plausibly associated with the undisturbed intergalactic medium ; a well - ordered field draped around the leading edges of the radio lobes and a field with small - scale fluctuations in the shells of compressed gas surrounding the inner lobes , perhaps associated with a mixing layer .",
    "in addition , we have emphasised that simple compression by the bow shock should lead to enhanced rm s around the leading edges , but that the observed patterns depend on the pre - shock field .",
    "mhd simulations should be able to address the formation of anisotropic magnetic - field structures around radio lobes and to constrain the initial conditions .",
    "in addition , our work raises a number of observational questions , including the following .    1 .   how common are anisotropic rm structures ?",
    "do they occur primarily in lobed radio galaxies with small axial ratios , consistent with jet - driven expansion into an unusually dense surrounding medium ?",
    "is their frequency qualitatively consistent with the two - dimensional draped - field picture ? 2 .",
    "why do we see bands primarily in sources where the isotropic rm component has a flat power spectrum of low amplitude ?",
    "is this just because the bands can be obscured by large - scale fluctuations , or is there a causal connection ? 3 .",
    "are the rm bands suggested in tailed sources such as 3c465 and hydraa caused by a similar phenomenon ( e.g.  bulk flow of the igm around the tails ) ? 4 .",
    "is an asymmetry between approaching and receding lobes seen in the banded rm component ?",
    "if so , what does that imply about the field structure ? 5 .",
    "how common are the regions of enhanced depolarization at the edges of radio lobes ? how strong is the field and what is its structure ?",
    "is there evidence for the presence of a mixing layer ?",
    "it should be possible to address all of these questions using a combination of observations with the new generation of synthesis arrays ( evla , e - merlin and lofar all have wide - band polarimetric capabilities ) and high - resolution x - ray imaging .",
    "we thank m. swain for providing the vla data for 3c353 , j. eilek for a fits image of 3c465 and j. croston , a. finoguenov and j. googder for the x - ray images of 3c270 , m84 and 3c353 , respectively .",
