    "in the quiet sun , the most prominent photospheric feature is the surface granulation pattern .",

    "the granulation pattern is non - stationary : studies of time - sequences of the granulation pattern in the quiet sun show that individual features evolve with an average lifetime of about @xmath2 minutes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while intensity images in the visible continuum taken near disk - center show bright granules and comparatively dark intergranular boundaries , observations taken in the wings of the  ca  ii  h & k  lines exhibit a similar pattern , but with reversed intensity contrast  @xcite .",
    "this effect , known as the  _ reversed granulation _ , has also been detected in intensity measurements of photospheric spectral lines  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the reversal of the intensity contrast occurs already at a height of about @xmath3 km above the mean geometric level where @xmath4 .",
    "recently ,  @xcite acquired simultaneous , speckle - reconstructed images of quiet - sun granulation in the g - band and the  ca  ii  h  line .",
    "on the basis of cross - correlations between time sequences of intensity images in these two spectral ranges they found that the anticorrelation between the two patterns is highest if the  ca  ii  h  intensity maps are time - delayed by @xmath5 minutes with respect to the g - band intensity maps . by computing anticorrelation coefficients between ( 1 ) intensity images in the continuum and in the  fe  i  7090     line and ( 2 ) intensity images in the continuum and in the wing of the  ca  ii  8542    line ,  @xcite also found that the strongest anticorrelation occurs for a time delay of @xmath6 min .",
    "@xcite extended the work of  @xcite by calculating synthetic intensity images in the blue continuum and  in  the  ca  ii  h  wing ( in the lte approximation ) from a 3-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulation . from the unsmoothed synthetic intensity images , they found that the anticorrelation between the continuum images and the  ca  ii  h  wing images does not vary significantly between a time delay of @xmath7 and @xmath8 minutes .",
    "the anticorrelation decreased for longer time delays . when the images were smoothed to @xmath9 arcsec resolution , a time - delay of @xmath5 minutes yielded a significantly higher value of the anticorrelation compared to zero time delay .",
    "@xcite speculated that magnetic fields play no major role in the formation of the reversed granulation .",

    "its overturning motion supplies the network of intergranular downflows .",
    "simulations have also revealed that the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations in the middle / upper photosphere is inverted compared to the corresponding pattern at the base of the photosphere . whereas at the base of the photosphere , the granules are relatively hot compared to the intergranular network , the former are relatively cooler for @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that this reversal in the temperature fluctuations in the photosphere is responsible for the reversal in the observed intensity pattern  @xcite .",
    "what is less clear is the physical mechanism which leads to the reversal of the temperature fluctuations with height .",
    "it is sometimes incorrectly assumed that fluid travelling in the optically thin layers of the photosphere does so adiabatically . as pointed out by  @xcite",
    ", this can not be true because material with an original temperature of @xmath11 k penetrating and expanding adiabatically in the photosphere would reach a temperature of @xmath12 k after traversing only three pressure scale heights .",

    "@xcite  indeed find that fluid rising in the photosphere is typically reheated by the radiation field .",
    "this leads one to conclude that non - adiabatic effects , such as radiative energy exchange , must play a crucial role in the formation of the reversed temperature fluctuations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the physical origin of the reversal of temperature fluctuations .",
    "as we shall see in the following sections , radiative energy exchange is indeed key to the temperature fluctuation reversal . by following in detail the time histories of fluid elements penetrating into the photosphere , we identify how radiative heating and cooling , in tandem with the horizontal pressure fluctuations , causes the reversed granulation .",

    "the main difference between the results of the two cases it that the non - grey case yields smaller temperature fluctuations in the photosphere than the grey case .",
    "this difference arises because the grey case underestimates the smoothing effects of radiative transfer in the optically thin layers of the photosphere in comparison with the non - grey case  @xcite . our explanation for the reversed granulation phenomenon ( see   [ subsec : reversed_granulation_structure ] )",

    "we study the reversed granulation in our 3d model . for lines that form under approximate lte conditions , such as some fe i lines and the wings of the  ca  ii  h  &  k  lines , fluctuations in line intensity are a proxy for diagnosing temperature fluctuations .",
    "the intensity image therefore maps the temperature distribution in the layer of the atmosphere in which the corresponding part of the line is formed .",

    "the reversed granulation is already clearly discernible : the lanes are regions of temperature excess . when we inspect the velocity structure , we find that the pattern at @xmath57 is very similar to that at @xmath60 , albeit with smaller flow speeds .",
    "the upflows in the higher layers result from the overshooting of upwelling gas from the convection zone .",
    "thus , the reversal of the pattern of temperature ( and intensity ) fluctuations is  _ not _ accompanied by a reversal in the velocity pattern  ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : reverse_temperature_fluctuation ] . in the convection zone ( @xmath66 ) , the temperature fluctuations at a given geometrical height are much larger than the temperature fluctuations at constant optical depth . as pointed out by  @xcite , this is due to the high temperature sensitivity of the h@xmath67 contribution to the continuum opacity . in this figure ,",
    "the two curves cross each other at @xmath68 . on average ,",
    "the surface of constant optical depth at @xmath68 is elevated above the @xmath56 surface by @xmath69 km .",
    "the fact that the two different averaging procedures yield somewhat different heights ( @xmath0 km and @xmath70 km , respectively ) for the layer of the photosphere where the temperature fluctuations reverse their sign is easily understood . in the former case , we calculated the horizontal temperature fluctuations relative to the mean temperature of the layer at different geometrical heights . in the latter case , the temperature fluctuations correspond to deviations from the mean temperature at surfaces of constant optical depth .",
    "since these surfaces are corrugated ( e.g. the rms fluctuation of the geometrical height of the @xmath56 surface is @xmath71 km ) , temperature fluctuations across such a surface only approximate the horizontal temperature fluctuations at the same geometrical height . in terms of both geometrical height and optical depth ,",
    "our determination of the level at which the reversal occurs is in good agreement with previous observational work  @xcite .",
    "the analysis in the previous section confirmed the reversal of horizontal temperature fluctuations in the middle photosphere .",
    "now we proceed to explain the physics behind this phenomenon .",
    "there are two important aspects to the explanation .",
    "firstly , we need to understand the nature of convective overshoot of granular fluid into the photosphere : namely , what is the balance of forces controlling the dynamics of convective penetration and overturn ? secondly , we need to understand the thermodynamical processes experienced by the overshooting material .    in order to address these issues , we have examined the histories of tracer fluid elements in our simulation . at time @xmath72 ( corresponding to the snapshot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reverse_granulation ] ) , tracer fluid elements were introduced just beneath the surface inside a granule and propagated according to the simulated velocity field .",
    "the physical properties of the fluid elements ( e.g. @xmath73 etc . ) at their actual positions were determined by tricubic interpolation from the values in the adjacent cells  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fountain_qtot ] shows a subvolume of the simulation domain in the neighbourhood of the granule centered at @xmath74=[7,8]$ ] mm in fig .",
    "[ fig : reverse_granulation ] .",
    "the greyscale image at @xmath44 indicates the vertical velocity at @xmath44 at the instant when the tracer fluid elements were released ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the colour - coding of the trajectories indicate the sign of @xmath32 : dark blue means @xmath75 ( cooling ) , yellow means @xmath76 ( heating ) .",
    "the set of trajectories resembles a fountain : the fluid elements originate from the granule interior , travel up to the photosphere and eventually overturn and descend into the downflow network in the convection zone .",
    "first we concentrate on the motion and dynamics of the fluid elements . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fountain_qtot ] shows , in spite of the strongly stable average stratification , the fluid elements are able to penetrate into the photosphere .",
    "the shape of the trajectories tell us that in the photosphere , they experience a deceleration in the vertical direction and a deflection towards the edge of the granule .    in the following ,",
    "we give a brief description of the force balance which drives the horizontal granular outflows and the feeding of the downflows in the intergranular lanes .",
    "inspection of the horizontal pressure fluctuations in the photospheric layers of our simulation reveal that local pressure hills in the interior of granules are responsible for the buoyancy braking of the upflows and the deflection of material horizontally outwards from the centres of granules . at the interface between two granules , the horizontal outflows from the granules",
    "meet and develop localized pressure ridges .",
    "these localized regions of pressure enhancement serve to retard the horizontal granular outflows .",
    "so , when a fluid element in the granular outflow approaches the intergranular boundary , it is decelerated by the pressure gradient .",
    "finally , the pressure enhancement at the boundaries , together with gravity , work in tandem to accelerate the fluid element downwards , thereby feeding the intergranular downflow network .",
    "these results are in accordance with results from 2d idealized simulations of compressible convection  @xcite and 3d near - surface convection simulations  @xcite .      to avoid confusion in the following discussion , at this point we would like to clarify the following terminology : by heating ( cooling ) , we refer to a non - adiabatic process which increases ( decreases ) the specific entropy of a fluid element . for example , when a fluid element absorbs more radiation than it emits , it is heated and gains entropy . a fluid element which is compressed adiabatically , however , will have a higher final temperature but is not heated .",
    "in the absence of viscous dissipation or thermal conduction , the equation governing the evolution of the specific entropy of a fluid element is @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the lagrangian derivative  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equation governing the temperature of a fluid element is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is chandrasekhar s third adiabatic exponent .",

    "inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : temperature_evolution2 ] ) motivates us to define the dynamical and radiative timescales respectively as @xmath82    in the case that @xmath83 , the motion of a fluid element is essentially adiabatic . in the opposite extreme , where @xmath84 , the fluid element is always in radiative equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "now we proceed to discuss the thermodynamic history of fluid elements overshooting into the photosphere . owing to the large opacity for @xmath66 , fluid in the upwellings in the convection zone",
    "ascend almost adiabatically .",
    "the decrease of a fluid element s temperature during its rise in the convection zone is due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "as it approaches the photosphere , the opacity drops rapidly and the fluid element loses entropy by radiative cooling .",
    "thereafter , the fluid element overshoots into the stably stratified photosphere . although the fluid element is now optically thin , it is not completely transparent to radiation and continues to exchange energy with its surroundings . in regions above granules , ( consisting of overshooting material ) ,",
    "radiative energy exchange predominantly leads to heating .",
    "this effect can be seen in the colour - coding of the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig : fountain_qtot ] .",
    "this figure clearly indicates that as the fluid elements penetrate into the photosphere ( and as they are diverted toward the intergranular lanes ) , they experience radiative heating .",

    "there are two reasons for this behaviour .",
    "firstly , there is a lag between when the fluid element overturns and when @xmath32 switches sign ( see previous paragraph ) .",
    "secondly , the asymmetry in the speed of upflows ( slower ) and downflows ( faster ) means that the cumulative heating experienced by the fluid element over its journey upwards in the photosphere is greater than the accumulative radiative cooling it undergoes on the return journey .",
    "these two factors contribute to the temperature and entropy enhancements of the intergranular boundaries ( downflows ) with respect to the granules ( upflows ) .    ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in order to test whether dissipative effects ( viscous and thermal , e.g. in shocks ) play a role in causing the temperature enhancement in the intergranular lanes in the upper photosphere , we have reconstructed the profiles of @xmath116 along the trajectory neglecting hyperdiffusivity effects . by keeping track of @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 along the trajectory of a fluid element , we can reconstruct the time history of @xmath116 for a fluid element .",
    "given these profiles and the initial entropy @xmath132 of the fluid element , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : entropy_evolution ] ) can be integrated to yield the reconstructed entropy profile @xmath133 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis_prediction ] together with the entropy profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis_curves ] .",
    "the good match of the two profiles in the layers @xmath134 tells us that radiation is indeed the cause of hysteresis in the entropy and temperature profiles .",
    "the reconstructed profile @xmath128 begins to deviate from the tracer profile once the fluid element approaches the narrow turbulent downflow jets in the convection zone . here",
    "the radiative effects diminish and dissipative effects described by the hyperdiffusive terms become important .",
    "the reversed granulation is a reversal of the pattern of intensity contrast between intensity maps in the continuum and intensity maps in spectral lines forming in the middle to upper photosphere .",
    "it has long been established that this reversal of the intensity fluctuations is a result of the sign change of the horizontal temperature fluctuations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reverse_temperature_fluctuation ] ) .",
    "analysis of our 3d numerical model of the near - surface convection zone and photosphere confirms the existence of this reversal in the temperature fluctuations above a height of @xmath0 km , in agreement with previous observational findings .    by following in detail the time histories of fluid elements overshooting into the photosphere",
    ", we were able to identify the processes that determine the horizontal temperature fluctuations in the photosphere .",
    "we find that changes in the temperature of fluid elements in the photosphere result from adiabatic expansion and radiative heating . whereas the former decreases the gas temperature of a fluid element , the latter increases it towards the radiative equilibrium temperature @xmath85 .",
    "the ratio of the associated characteristic timescales tells us that , for a fluid element rising in the optically thin layers , the decrease of temperature due to expansion is only partially cancelled by radiative heating .",
    "this disparity allows a fluid element to depart from radiative equilibrium as it penetrates into the photosphere . due to this deviation from @xmath85 , a fluid element overturning in the optically thin layers",
    "still experiences some radiative heating as it begins to descend .",
    "this , together with the fact that downflows have higher vertical speed than upflows , leads to a hysteretic behaviour of the thermodynamic history of the fluid element ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hysteresis_curves ] ) .    in various guises in previous works ,",
    "the following explanation has often been invoked to explain the origin of the reversal of temperature fluctuations : since the photosphere is subadiabatically stratified , material rising from granules into this stable layer has lower temperature that its ` mean surroundings ' .",
    "this view is problematic in two respects .",
    "firstly , it implicitly assumes that material penetrating into the photosphere does so in an adiabatic fashion .",
    "secondly , it is not at all clear what are the ` mean surroundings ' of a fluid element embedded in convective flow consisting of disjointed upwellings separated by an intergranular network .",
    "our present efforts highlight the importance of radiative energy exchange in the dynamics of the photosphere and helps dispel possible misconceptions regarding the origin of the reversed granulation in the photosphere .",
