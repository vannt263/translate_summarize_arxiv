    "the modern trend toward studying galaxy properties as a function of mass rather than luminosity has led to remarkable advances in our understanding of galaxy evolution , making the calibration of mass estimation techniques a high priority . based on comparisons of dynamical and stellar - mass ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) estimates ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that multi - band photometry alone can provide accurate @xmath6 estimates that correlate well with @xmath5 .",
    "even better , modeling of the correlation between optical colors and stellar mass - to - light ratios @xmath7 suggests that factor - of - two accuracy in @xmath6 may be achievable with just three filters , especially when using optical colors to infer an @xmath8- or @xmath3-band @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , recent work @xcite cautions that @xmath6 estimation may be more complicated than previously assumed , as young stellar populations may contribute substantially to not only optical but also near - infrared light , via thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars . using these models and those of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite find substantial inconsistencies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 estimates at low and high @xmath9 that appear only when near - ir photometry is used .    to date ,",
    "empirical examinations of these issues have relied on mixed data sets , making it hard to isolate systematics in @xmath6 estimation from evolution between low and high redshift galaxies and/or effects of inhomogeneous data . here",
    ", we take advantage of the high - quality , uniform data available for the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including photometry , spectrophotometry , and gas and stellar kinematics , to evaluate @xmath6 estimation techniques .",
    "our sample allows us to explore effects of stellar population age on @xmath6 estimation at a single redshift , as it includes late - type galaxies , classical e / s0 galaxies that fall on the red color-@xmath6 sequence , and galaxies with e / s0 morphologies that fall on the blue color-@xmath6 sequence due to recent star formation (  blue - sequence e / s0s  * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kgb ) .",
    "the nfgs provides a broadly representative galaxy sample spanning a wide range of luminosities and morphologies . for @xmath6 estimation ,",
    "we analyze 141 nfgs galaxies with _ ubrjhk _ photometry and integrated ( slit - scanned ) optical spectrophotometry from @xcite and the two micron all - sky survey extended source catalog ( 2mass xsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; see kgb for sample selection details .",
    "we also check our results using @xmath10 photometry for 92 of these galaxies , taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "photometry and spectra are corrected for foreground extinction using @xcite and the galactic extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "we do not apply internal extinction corrections to the data used for mass determination ( though corrections based on the method of @xcite are used incidentally for defining the red and blue sequences , with no effect on our mass error budget ; see kgb ) .",
    "however , dust is either included in our modeling or , in the case of color-@xmath7 relations , neglected following standard practice .",
    "we add 0.1 mag in quadrature to the catalogued internal magnitude uncertainties for all passbands to account for systematic uncertainties in foreground extinction corrections , automated 2mass photometry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b03 ) , and relative photometric zero points . for the spectra",
    ", we add relative flux calibration uncertainties ( typically 6% , but up to 9% outside 40006800  ; r. jansen , priv .",
    "comm . ) in quadrature to the formal uncertainties .",
    "our `` reference '' @xmath6 values are computed by fitting the photometry and spectra to a discrete grid of stellar population synthesis models from @xcite , scaled to a `` diet salpeter '' imf as used by b03 .",
    "we combine two simple stellar populations ( ssps ) in varying mass fractions ( 100:0% , 90:10% , 80:20% , etc . ) , where we have normalized each ssp to @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "each individual ssp has one of eight ages ( 0.025 , 0.1 , 0.29 , 0.64 , 1 , 2.5 , 5 , 11 gyr ) and three metallicities ( 0.4z@xmath11 , z@xmath11 , 2.5z@xmath11 ) , and each combination of ssps has one of eleven dust optical depths ( @xmath12 = 0 , 0.12 , 0.24 , ... , 1.2 ) .",
    "we derive model photometry by convolving nfgs ( standard johnson - cousins ) , sdss , and 2mass filter profiles with bruzual - charlot model spectra and adding attenuation using a @xcite law .",
    "the code scales each model to the observed photometry in @xmath13 units , yielding the estimated @xmath6 for that model , then computes likelihoods @xmath14 for the entire grid of models .",
    "in a first pass , we fit only the photometry , redshifting the models to match the individual galaxy spectroscopic redshifts and comparing with redshift - zero models to determine @xmath15-corrections . in a second pass ,",
    "the likelihood - weighted average @xmath15-corrections are applied to the input photometry , and the code fits both the photometry and the de - redshifted spectra to a fixed set of models in the rest frame .",
    "we mask emission lines , limit the spectral range to 38007000  , and convolve the model spectra to the 6  resolution of the nfgs spectra . as the spectra lack absolute flux calibration ,",
    "their scale factors are allowed to vary freely .",
    "the likelihood of each model is the product of the likelihoods inferred from the photometry and the spectra , so the @xmath16 terms sum in the exponent and can be weighted to set the relative influence of the spectra and photometry .",
    "we adopt @xmath17 , where the latter two terms are contributions from fits to the raw and continuum - normalized spectra and @xmath18 is the number of degrees of freedom in @xmath19 , normally five when fitting six filters ( losing one to the scale - factor determination ) .",
    "once the photometric data are reasonably well fit ( @xmath20 ) , the likelihoods are affected only by the spectra .",
    "otherwise , the likelihoods are equally influenced by the reduced-@xmath16 values of the spectra and photometry , because the ratio of the number of data points is @xmath0500 ( where the strong covariance between @xmath21 and @xmath22 justifies treating them as a joint @xmath23 term ) .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the median of the likelihood distribution binned over @xmath24 rather than the best fit to determine the final @xmath6 , and we estimate uncertainties from the 68% confidence interval in @xmath24 ( binning in 0.02 dex intervals ) .",
    "@xmath6 estimates based on the @xmath4 vs.  @xmath25 relation are derived from the calibrations of b03 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p04 ) .",
    "the b03 calibration is based on a global linear fit to @xmath25 vs.  synthetic @xmath4 for a large sample of galaxies with @xmath26 data , where each galaxy is fitted with pegase population synthesis models @xcite to find the best - fit metallicity and exponential star formation history ( sfh ) , which may be decaying , constant , or rising .",
    "the p04 calibration is predicted from chemo - photometric models of galactic disks , which include tp - agb stars .",
    "we use p04 s salpeter imf calibration , multiplying the resulting masses by 0.7 to match the diet salpeter imf scale of b03 .",
    "technically , p04 limit their calibration to @xmath4 = 0.951.45 , and our use of the relation sometimes extends outside this range .",
    "factor of two uncertainties are predicted for color - based mass estimation , primarily due to variations in sfh but also due to the neglect of internal reddening and extinction ( expected to vary mainly along the @xmath4 vs.  @xmath25 relation , see * ? ? ?",
    "because color-@xmath7 relations do not provide a self - consistent way to compute @xmath15-corrections , we @xmath15-correct the input magnitudes using our standard method described above .    when comparing @xmath6 and @xmath5 , we apply more restrictive sample selection criteria . after rejecting",

    "we require the rescaled dispersion to satisfy @xmath34  to ensure negligible rotation corrections ( e.g. , fig .  8 of kgb ) .    for late types ,",
    "gas masses are computed from the hi line flux with a helium - mass correction factor of 1.4 and a type- and mass - dependent molecular - gas correction factor of 1.061.4 ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt an uncertainty of 50% in the total gas mass . for the e / s0s , which are all massive given our cut in @xmath35 , we assume gas masses are negligible ( the largest measured gas - to - stellar mass ratio in this subsample is @xmath36% ) .",
    "dynamical masses are computed for the e / s0 subsample using @xmath37 , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "we add 5% in quadrature to the uncertainties in @xmath33 for profile extrapolation errors , and 5% and 7% , respectively , to the uncertainties in @xmath35 for template mismatch and aperture rescaling errors .",
    "for the spiral / irregular subsample we use @xmath38 , assuming @xmath39 scales like @xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here @xmath39 is 0.5@xmath29 the inclination - corrected @xmath41 linewidth parameter of kff .",
    "we assume @xmath42  and @xmath43 .",
    "note that our error bars do not include distance errors because distances are largely irrelevant to comparisons between mass estimates .",
    "various @xmath6 estimation methods are compared in fig .  1 , with the ratio between the alternate and reference @xmath6 s plotted as a function of reference @xmath6 in each panel .",
    "2 compares @xmath44 estimates against @xmath5 in the same format , where the notation @xmath44 indicates a gas mass correction for late types (   [ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "we stress that differences between methods do not imply that one or the other is correct , and differences relative to @xmath5 must be interpreted carefully , given the potential for real variation in dark - matter content or structural properties .    figs .",
    "1a  c and 2a  c test the robustness of our reference @xmath6 s against substitution of @xmath10 for @xmath45 , omission of the spectra from the fits , and exclusion of the near - ir _ jhk _ data . replacing @xmath45 with @xmath10 , a slight offset appears in fig .",
    "nfgs photometry appears more reliable : fig .",
    "2b demonstrates that @xmath44 estimates based on sdss photometry yield greater scatter relative to @xmath5 for late - type galaxies , and inspection of the fits reveals that sdss data have a fairly high rate of catastrophic errors relative to 2mass and nfgs data , perhaps due to systematic errors in defining galaxy apertures or profiles .",
    "note that the apparent improvement in scatter for e / s0 galaxies in fig .",
    "2b is probably fortuitous : the open squares mark galaxies from fig .",
    "2a that do not have sdss data , showing that they tend to be the galaxies with the largest scatter . @xmath6 s obtained with and without spectra are closely consistent ( fig .",
    "1b ) and compare similarly with dynamical mass ( not shown ) .",
    "taking advantage of this result , we have verified that our reference @xmath6 s are robust to using a finer resolution in mass ratio between the two ssps : 100:0% , 98:2% , 96:4% , etc , where for computational efficiency only the photometry is fitted . finally , omission of near - ir data ( fig .",
    "1c ) produces generally consistent results , with a few outliers .",
    "the outliers are all late - type galaxies with fairly low surface brightness , whose 2mass magnitudes may be underestimated .",
    "alternatively , in such bursty systems , @xmath7 may be overestimated without the ir data to anchor the fits .",
    "these systems do not show large shifts from fig .",
    "2a to 2c because their @xmath44 is gas - dominated .    substituting @xcite models for bruzual - charlot models , stronger differences emerge ( figs .",
    "1d  f and 2d  f ) .",
    "1d shows a factor of two difference in the relative @xmath6 scales of high - mass red - sequence e / s0s compared to both blue - sequence e / s0s and late - type galaxies .",
    "with spectra omitted ( fig .",
    "1e ) , this difference grows to a factor of three , whereas with near - ir _ jhk _ data omitted ( fig .",
    "1f ) , it disappears entirely , though a small overall scale difference remains ( with maraston models yielding @xmath461.3@xmath29 lower @xmath6 ) . excluding near - ir data , @xmath44 estimates based on bruzual - charlot and maraston models compare nearly identically to @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "the differences when near - ir data are included come almost entirely from the maraston models and cause shifts relative to @xmath5 in fig .",
    "however , these shifts are within the uncertainties and might be physical : in a hierarchical scenario , late - type galaxies may have both more dark matter and more scatter in dark matter content than early - type galaxies . also , blue - sequence e / s0s may have basic structural differences from red - sequence e / s0s that lead to overestimated @xmath5 , if their @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 values are elevated due to incomplete post - merger evolution or disk - building processes ( kgb )",

    "however , inspection of the data from which the b03 relation was determined ( their fig .  20 ) reveals that their linear fit is skewed by a two - component distribution , consisting of a dominant linear locus and a cloud of outliers with blue colors and high @xmath7",
