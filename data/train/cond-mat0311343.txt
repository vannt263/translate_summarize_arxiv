    "the phenomenon of anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) in magnetic conductors expresses the dependence of the resistivity @xmath3 on the angle @xmath4 between the current @xmath5 and the magnetization @xmath6 . in polycrystals",
    "the amr effect is commonly found to follow : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the resistivity when @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the resistivity when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this simple relation is not expected to hold in crystalline samples where both the current orientation relative to the lattice as well as the magnetization orientation relative to the lattice play an important role .    here we present amr measurements of thin films of the @xmath12__d _ _ itinerant ferromagnet srruo@xmath0 above @xmath1 ( @xmath13 k ) .",
    "those films are epitaxial and characterized by large uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) @xcite . in our measurements , we study the amr in uncommon conditions : ( a ) while in most amr measurements the orientation of @xmath6 is changed without changing its magnitude , here , because of the large mca both orientation and magnitude of @xmath6 are changing ; and ( b ) while in most amr measurement the applied field @xmath14 is parallel to @xmath6 , here , because of the large mca @xmath15 except for the cases where @xmath14 is along the easy or hard axes .",
    "therefore , to explore the amr in srruo@xmath0 it is not sufficient to measure magnetoresistance ( mr ) as a function of angle , but we need to independently determine both the magnitude and orientation of @xmath6 .    our films are grown on miscut ( @xmath16 ) srtio@xmath0 substrates using reactive electron beam epitaxy .",
    "the films have orthorhombic structure ( @xmath17  , @xmath18  , @xmath19  ) and they grow uniformly ( without twinning ) with the @xmath20 axis in the film plane and the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes at @xmath23 out of the plane ( see fig .",
    "[ sam ] ) @xcite .",
    "the mca is uniaxial with the easy axis along the @xmath22 axis and thus the uniform growth of the measured films can be confirmed by mr measurements in the ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "the films were patterned by photolithography to allow hall effect ( he ) and mr measurements .",
    "the sample whose results are presented here is @xmath24   thick with @xmath1 @xmath25 k and resistivity ratio of @xmath26 .",
    "our measurements have two parts : ( a ) extraordinary hall effect ( ehe )  @xcite measurements from which we extract both the magnitude and the orientation of @xmath6 , and ( b ) mr measurements for currents in the @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] directions . combining the two measurements we show that the mr can  be fit very well with a second order magnetization expansion .",
    "both he and mr measurements were performed as a function of the angle @xmath29 between the applied field @xmath14 and the easy axis , where @xmath14 is rotating in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "each film has two kinds of patterns : a pattern with current along the @xmath28 $ ] direction ( denoted  p@xmath31 ) and a pattern with current along the @xmath27 $ ] direction ( denoted  p@xmath32 ) . while in p@xmath31",
    "the angle between @xmath5 and @xmath14 varies with @xmath29 , in p@xmath32 the field @xmath14 is always perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sam ] .",
    "the hall field in magnetic conductors has two contributions : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnetic field , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the ordinary and the extraordinary hall coefficients , respectively . by measuring the he in our films at a temperature where @xmath36 vanishes @xcite we determined @xmath35 , which enabled to extract @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the component of @xmath6 which is perpendicular to the film plane ) at all temperatures",
    "this is not sufficient , however , since we need to determine both components of @xmath6 . for",
    "that we note that based on symmetry considerations we may assume that if a field @xmath14 , that is applied in the @xmath30 plane at an angle @xmath29 relative to the easy axis , creates a magnetization @xmath6 pointing at an angle @xmath39 relative to the easy axis , then applying the same field at an angle @xmath40 will create the same magnetization , but at an angle @xmath41 @xcite . in our case",
    "the easy axis is at @xmath23 out of the plane thus symmetry considerations yield that @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath38 are the in - plane and perpendicular components of @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "consequently , by measuring the hall resistivity ( @xmath44 ) at @xmath29 and @xmath40 we obtain : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which allows to determine @xmath6 ( multiplied by @xmath47 ) .",
    "figures [ mr]a and [ mr]b show the change in the magnitude and direction of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath29 at @xmath48 k determined with that method . as expected , @xmath6 obtains its maximum value at @xmath49 and lags behind @xmath14 except for @xmath14 along @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it seems that this is the first time that ehe which is sensitive only to the perpendicular component of the magnetization is used for extracting the full magnetization vector based on symmetry consideration .",
    "this is possible only due to the tilted easy axis .",
    "where the easy axis is perpendicular or parallel to the film this scheme is not applicable .",
    "figures [ mr](c ) and [ mr](d ) present the mr measured at @xmath48 k for @xmath50 t and @xmath51 t in p@xmath31 and p@xmath32 . to fit the mr data we expand mr in @xmath6 , noting that due to the mr symmetry under field inversion the lowest order expansion is of second order .",
    "since in our experiment @xmath6 remains in the @xmath30 plane it is sufficient to use two components of @xmath6 .",
    "we use the freedom of choosing the principle axes to take them in the crystallographic directions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the general expansion of the mr to lowest order is:@xmath52@xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the components of @xmath6 along the easy axis ( @xmath22 ) and hard axis ( @xmath21 ) , respectively . the lines in figs .",

    "( d ) mr in p@xmath32 . for graphs ( c ) and ( d )",
    "the points represent the experimental results and the lines represent the fit . ]",
    "we obtained the following fitting parameters at @xmath48 k : @xmath59 , @xmath60 for the p@xmath31 pattern , and @xmath61 , @xmath62 for the p@xmath32 pattern .",
    "the error limits indicate the evaluated changes in the fitting parameters in case there is difference between the instrumental @xmath29 and the actual @xmath29 of up to @xmath16 .",
    "the fits of the mr data based on eq .",
    "[ mr expansion ] allow us to determine the `` clean '' amr effect ; namely , how would the resistivity change if we could rotate @xmath6 in the @xmath30 plane without changing its magnitude .",
    "figure [ hip ] shows the expected behavior at @xmath48 k for p@xmath31 and p@xmath32 for a value of magnetization obtained with @xmath58 t along the easy axis .    for p@xmath32",
    "we note that although @xmath64 there is a significant amr ( @xmath65 ) , and that @xmath66 is within our experimental accuracy , as could be expected from symmetry considerations .",
    "these results exhibit strong dependence of the mr not only on the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( which remains constant ) but also on the direction of @xmath6 relative to the crystal .",
    "for p@xmath31 we note that the extremum values are not obtained for @xmath67  or @xmath64 but at intermediate angles .",
    "in fact , the extremum  values for p@xmath31 are in between those obtained in p@xmath32 ( along the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes ) and those observed in polycrystals ( parallel and perpendicular to @xmath5 ) .",
    "this shows that in our case the amr related to the orientation of @xmath6 with respect to the lattice is of the same order of magnitude as the amr due to the relative orientation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also note that for @xmath68 , which corresponds to @xmath6 perpendicular to the plane the mr is different in p@xmath31 and p@xmath32 despite the fact that in both cases @xmath64 .",
    "this illustrates the dependence of mr on the direction of @xmath5 relative to the crystal .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented amr investigation of srruo@xmath0 with simultaneous measurements of @xmath6 and mr in the same pattern thus enabling accurate determination of its amr behavior despite the change in the magnitude of @xmath6 and in its relative angle with @xmath14 .",
    "the results indicate significant amr even in the paramagnetic state , where @xmath6 is relatively small , and large effect of the orientation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 relative to the crystal axes .",
    "as the sample is rotated in applied magnetic field , jumps in magnetoresistance which correspond to magnetization reversal occur at angles consistent with a uniform direction of the easy axis throughout the sample ."
