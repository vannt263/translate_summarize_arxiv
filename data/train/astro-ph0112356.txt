    "many galaxies in the nearby universe ( @xmath4 ) contain an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) which features a central low - ionization narrow emission - line region ( liner ) .",
    "these agns typically have a bolometric luminosity @xmath5 which is orders of magnitude smaller than those of classical agn at higher redshifts , such as seyferts , quasars and broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "the energy for the activity is thought to be provided by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole residing at the galaxy center in all agn classes .",
    "radio galaxies constitute a subset of the active galaxy family .",
    "these galaxies have radio cores at their centers from which jets emerge .",
    "radio galaxies are divided in two classes based on differences in large - scale radio morphology : low - power fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) type i ( fr i ) radio galaxies and high - power radio fr ii galaxies ( cf .",
    "bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "many nearby fr i nuclei show optical liner emission ( e.g. , baum , zirbel & odea 1995 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the active cores of nearby fr i galaxies and the relation to their nearby liner - type counterparts without radio jets .",
    "the hosts of fr i galaxies are almost without exception bright early - type galaxies ( see ledlow et al .",
    "2001 for counter example ) .",
    "quiescent and fr i radio galaxies in nearby abell clusters show no statistical differences in their global properties ( ledlow & owen 1995 )",
    ". the two classes do not differ in surface - brightness profiles , the surface - brightness and size relations , the distribution over ellipticities , and the occurrence and strength of non - elliptical isophotes .",
    "zirbel ( 1993 , 1996 ) found that fr i galaxies are larger than radio - quiet galaxies at given isophotal magnitude , but this result was not confirmed by ledlow & owen ( 1995 ) .",
    "ledlow & owen ( 1995 ) did not find differences between the radio - loud and quiescent cluster galaxies in the local density of nearby companions , and in the frequency of morphological peculiarities or tidal interactions .",
    "studies of samples of fr i galaxies either in the field or in small groups found indications of tidal interactions in a majority of them ( gonzalez - serrano & carballo 1993 ; colina & de juan 1995 ) . it is unknown if this rate is different for quiescent galaxies in similar environments . in summary , it is unlikely that host environment and host global properties are decisive for the capability of an early - type galaxy to become a fr i galaxy , but tidal interactions might trigger the nuclear activity , at least in some cases .    with the advent of hst it has become possible to look for host galaxy differences closer to the agn itself . in a previous paper ( verdoes kleijn et al .",
    "1999 ) we presented wfpc2 broad- and narrow - band images of a well - defined complete sample of 21 nearby fr i early - type ugc galaxies , the ` ugc fr i sample ' .",
    "similar wfpc2 surveys of radio galaxies have been carried out also for the 3cr sample ( martel et al .",
    "1999 ; de koff et al .  2000 ) and the b2 sample ( capetti  et al .",
    "the ugc fr i sample wfpc2 data suggest that the stellar content ( i.e. , color and shape ) is very similar to that of quiescent early - type galaxies including the central few kiloparsec .",
    "however , a rigorous comparison with a quiescent galaxy sample to discern subtle differences has not yet been performed .",
    "potential agn fuel is clearly present in the inner hundreds of parsecs .",
    "central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission is detected in all sample galaxies and dust is detected in 19/21 galaxies .",
    "other samples of fr i galaxies show emission - line detection rates of @xmath6 ( e.g. , baum & heckman 1989 ; morganti et al .",
    "the detection rate of small - scale dust in quiescent early - type galaxies is typically only @xmath7 ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ; tran  et al .",
    "2001 ) , while emission - line gas is detected in typically @xmath8 of the quiescent early - type galaxy population ( philips et al .  1986 ; goudfrooij  et al .",
    "thus , the detection rate of potential fuel for an agn is lower but significant in quiescent galaxies and hence its presence seems not to be the only factor determining the on - set of activity .    a vlba study of the radio properties of the cores and the inner jets in the ugc fr i nuclei has been presented by xu et al .  ( 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we analyze the correlation between this agn radio emission and optical continuum and h@xmath0+[nii ] core emission as observed with hst / wfpc2 .",
    "we compare the ugc fr i core properties to those of 3cr fr i cores which have been studied in the radio , optical and x - rays ( e.g. , chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ; hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) . for the 3cr sample ,",
    "the correlations between the core emissions have led to favor the inner jet as their origin .",
    "we determine the validity for different agn components to produce the core emissions in the ugc fr i galaxies .",

    "their data reduction and isophotal analysis was carried out as described in detail in paper i.      we use core and total flux densities from a vla a imaging survey at 1490 mhz ( fwhm @xmath11 ) ( wrobel , machalski & condon 2001 ) for the complete sample and from a vlba imaging survey at 1670 mhz ( fwhm @xmath12 ) for 18 ugc fr i sample galaxies as presented by xu et al .  ( 2000 ) .",
    "the vla a core flux density of 3c 449 is taken from feretti et al .",

    "has a fwhm @xmath20 at @xmath18 and @xmath19 and 85% of the flux counts , which we want to isolate from the underlying galaxy light , are contained inside @xmath21 .",
    "we approximate the underlying galaxy flux density inside @xmath21 by a constant .",
    "its value is estimated by measuring the counts in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath22 ( i.e. , 5 pc pixels ) and a width of @xmath23 .",
    "after subtracting the underlying galaxy counts from the counts inside @xmath22 , we measure the resulting flux profile inside this radius . if this profile is consistent with being unresolved ( i.e. , fwhm in the range @xmath24 ) we decide there is a point source present in addition to the stellar light .",
    "the nos counts were converted to fluxes using the ` photflam ' values given in the hst handbook ( ed .",
    "voit 1998 ) .",
    "we correct the fluxes for galactic fore - ground extinction and the 15% psf flux which falls outside the @xmath22 aperture .",
    "determination of the underlying stellar light can be difficult because dust is often present and the stellar light profile is sometimes bright and steep ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : nosexamples ] ) .",
    "in fact , our procedure tends to overestimate the nos flux , since galaxies typically have surface brightness profiles which are not constant but increasing towards the center .",
    "the irregular variations in the ubiquitous central dust obscuration inhibit accurate estimates of the individual central surface brightness slopes .",
    "simulations indicate that our procedure would overestimate the nos by typically 50% and at most a factor 2 for the galaxies with a nos detected in the ugc fr i sample if central dust were not present .",
    "to estimate how the nos flux estimate depends on aperture size , we determined the nos using varying apertures in the range @xmath25 .",
    "this typically results in nos fluxes which differ by @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to stellar galaxy light there is sometimes , depending on redshift , a contribution to the nos flux from the [ oiii]@xmath27 and h@xmath0+[nii ] emission lines for the f547w and f555w and f702w filters . using the central h@xmath0+[nii ] fluxes from paper i and assuming [ oiii]/h@xmath0+[nii]=0.12 , typical for the liner - type spectrum in fr i galaxies",
    ", we estimate that the contribution to the nos flux in these filters is typically @xmath28 and at most @xmath29 .",
    "given the aforementioned uncertainties and the difference in the spatial resolution of the broad- and narrow - band images , we did not attempt to correct the nos for this emission - line contribution .",
    "the central dust might obscure the nos and stellar background fluxes in several targets .",
    "we lack information on the nature of the dust obscuration to make a robust correction for internal dust obscuration . as an indication : if the observed opacity is caused by dust in front of the stellar flux and the nos , then the observed @xmath30 wfpc2 colors typically imply correction factors @xmath31 for the @xmath18-band nos fluxes .",
    "given all uncertainties , we expect that the detected nos fluxes are accurate to within a factor @xmath32 .",
    "nos were detected in 12 of the 21 galaxies .",
    "we estimate the expected nos for the non - detections from the correlation between nos and radio core and central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission ( see section  [ s : correlations ] ) .",
    "we added the expected nos counts artificially to the galaxy image as a scaled psf to determine the possible reason for the non - detection . adding the expected nos indicates that it would be easily detected in ngc 741 ( which has a shallow stellar surface brightness profile ) and marginally detected in ngc 541 , ngc 4335 , ngc 5141 , ngc 5490 and ngc 7626 .",
    "ngc 541 , ngc 4335 , ngc 5490 and ngc 7626 have a bright and steep underlying stellar surface brightness profile which makes detection of a nos difficult ( cf .",
    ", figure  [ f : nosexamples ] ) . thus these non - detections could be due to observational bias except for ngc 741 . in fact , all nos , except for ugc 7115 ,",
    "are detected in hosts with relatively shallow inner stellar surface brightness cusps . in the remaining three galaxies , ngc 3801 , ngc 5127 and ngc 7052",
    ", the expected nos could be hidden by foreground dust for plausible dust - extinction values . in ngc 7052",
    ", there is actually a hint of a very weak blue point source hidden behind the dust disk . for the galaxies with no obvious obscuration by foreground dust ,",
    "the upper limit to the nos flux was set to the flux measured within an aperture of @xmath33 radius ( i.e. , 80% of the flux for an unresolved source ) corrected for underlying stellar light . as a final check of the robustness of the nos detection procedures",
    ", we verified that both nos detections and upper limits do not correlate with the slope of the central stellar background flux profile .",
    "table  [ t : nucfluxdetection ] lists the nos flux detections and upper limits .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19-band nos fluxes generally differ by less than @xmath34 .",
    "our measurements agree typically within a factor @xmath35 with determinations by chiaberge , capetti & celotti ( 1999 ) for seven overlapping targets .",
    "there is about a factor two disagreement between the f791w fluxes for ugc 7360 and the f702w fluxes for 3c 449 .",
    "the former has a very weak nos which makes the measurement difficult .",
    "chiaberge et al .  corrected the latter measurement for h@xmath0+[nii ] which we estimated above to be about 15% of the nos flux .",
    "this might explain part of the difference for this measurement .    in conclusion , a nos is detected in @xmath36 ( 21/21 ) of the fr i nuclei",
    ", dust might hide a nos in another @xmath37 ( 3/21 ) , while upper limits to the nos emission can be determined for @xmath38 ( 6/21 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 narrow - band imaging presented in paper i shows that the h@xmath0+[nii ] emission is always dominated by a highly peaked nuclear component .",
    "additional extended emission is detected in several galaxies .",
    "thus , in close analogy with the unresolved nuclear optical continuum analysis , we determined the nuclear unresolved h@xmath0+[nii ] emission using the same procedure .",
    "we detected central h@xmath0+[nii ] flux cores with fwhm @xmath39 for the five targets with emission images on the pc detector and cores with a fwhm @xmath40 for 14 of the 15 targets on the wf2 detector .",
    "these fwhm indicate that this emission component is consistent with being unresolved ( the larger psf fwhm for the wf chip is caused by the larger wf pixel size ( @xmath41 ) compared to the pc pixel size ( @xmath23 ) ) .",
    "the h@xmath0+[nii ] flux cores were unresolved at hst resolution in all ugc fr i galaxies except ngc 3801 .",
    "for ngc 3801 we set the h@xmath0+[nii ] flux in the central 9 pixels ( @xmath42 of the psf flux ) as an upper limit .",
    "no wfpc2 h@xmath0+[nii ] image is available for ugc 7115 . in this case",
    "we estimated the core h@xmath0+[nii ] flux from hst / stis measurements , which will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the core h@xmath0+[nii ] fluxes are listed in table  [ t : nucfluxdetection ] . from estimates of the error in the stellar continuum subtraction and in the core flux measurement procedure",
    "we conclude that the core h@xmath0+[nii ] fluxes are accurate to within 50% .",
    "we now quantify the relation between nuclear radio , optical and h@xmath0+[nii ] line emission . by definition",
    "the optical continuum and h@xmath0+[nii ] core emission are unresolved at hst resolution ( fwhm @xmath43 ) which corresponds to a region on the order of a few tens of parsec or smaller .",
    "the vlba cores are unresolved at a resolution of fwhm @xmath12 and originates from a region smaller than a few pc in size .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ f : nucflux ] we plot the central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission as a function of vlba core peak emission both as flux and luminosity for 18 sample galaxies .",
    "the two quantities are well correlated : both flux and luminosity correlations have a significance level @xmath44 using kendall s tau test ( see tables  [ t : nucflux ] and [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the correlation is not due to selection effects or a common dependence on distance .",
    "3c274 ( m87 ) is a slight outlier on the luminosity - luminosity correlation plot .",
    "this could be due to the fact that part of the [ nii]6584 emission is redshifted out of the narrow - band filter ( ford et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the alternative of doppler boosting of the radio emission is discussed in section  [ s : accretion ] .",
    "two of the three missing objects , ugc 7115 and 3c 449 , lack vlba observations for reasons unrelated to their properties ( see section  [ s : radioobs ] ) .",
    "no radio core was detected in ngc 3801 .",
    "ngc 3801 has no detected core h@xmath0+[nii ] emission .",
    "thus we do not expect the missing objects to alter the correlations significantly .",
    "the luminosity - luminosity correlation extends over approximately two orders of magnitude in radio and h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity .",
    "a linear regression fit to the logarithmic values of the luminosities shows that the h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity is roughly proportional to the the radio core luminosity to the power 0.6 ( table  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "how does this correlation compare with previous studies of fr i nuclei ?",
    "baum , zirbel & odea ( 1995 ; see also zirbel & baum 1995 , zb95 ) performed an extensive study of a large sample of @xmath45 fr i galaxies , with radio and emission - line measurements gathered from the literature .",
    "their fr i sample extends @xmath46 1 magnitude brighter in host magnitude and total and core radio luminosities .",
    "zb95 found only a weak luminosity - luminosity correlation between integrated h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and the radio core at 5 ghz ( fwhm @xmath13 ) for fr i galaxies .",
    "they found a much stronger correlation between integrated h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and host magnitude .",
    "they also found a correlation with total radio luminosity , which turns out to be a weak ( 2@xmath47 ) correlation after taking into account the correlation with host magnitude .",
    "zb95 concluded that the h@xmath0+[nii ] emission gas in fr i galaxies was most likely predominantly excited by radiation from old stars .",
    "table  [ t : nuclum ] lists the parameters of the linear regression fits to the correlation between h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and host optical magnitude and total radio power for the ugc fr i sample .",
    "the fits agree with those obtained by zb95 after correction for the difference in the assumed value of the hubble constant and difference in radio frequency .",
    "however , for the ugc fr i sample the resulting correlations are much weaker than the correlation between h@xmath0+[nii ] and radio core .",
    "we compare the h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities for seven overlapping sources with h@xmath0+[nii ] flux measurements in the ugc fr i and zb95 sample . for four sources zb95 report larger h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities . for the other three sources zb95 actually use smaller h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities .",
    "however , from examination of the observational details there is clear indication for considerable uncertainty in each of these three measurements .",
    "thus , the difference in correlation strength seems caused by the fact that we consider the core h@xmath0+[nii ] fluxes , while zb95 considered total fluxes , which might be dominated by an extended component .",
    "the correlation between the central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and radio core emission is also present if we restrict the sample to the 11 overlapping targets and use the 5ghz core emission values from zb95 ( see tables  [ t : nucflux ] and [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "similarly , there is a good correlation between the central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and the vla core emission ( fwhm @xmath48 ) .",
    "it is significant at @xmath49 level and has a similar slope as the correlation with vlba core emission ( tables  [ t : nucflux ] and  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "thus the difference in spatial resolution of the vlba , vla and 5 ghz measurements does not seem relevant .",
    "the correlation with extended vlba radio emission is significant at the @xmath50 level and has a similar slope .",
    "no strong correlation is found between the extended vla emission and the h@xmath0+[nii ] emission .",
    "thus not surprisingly , the agn , which produces the radio core emission ( see also discussion in section  [ s : jet ] ) , very likely excites the gas in the central few hundreds of parsec in the fr i nuclei .",
    "more interestingly , the excitation energy correlates tightly with the central radio power .",
    "the correlation between total h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity and host galaxy magnitude , as found by zb95 , probably indicates that the gas on kpc scales is excited by some other process(es ) ( e.g. , radiation from old stars ) .",
    "the middle two panels in figure  [ f : nucflux ] plot the nuclear optical source emission in the @xmath19-band as a function of vlba core peak emission both in flux and luminosity for 16 of the 21 sample galaxies . in six galaxies",
    "the nos measurement is an upper limit .",
    "the two quantities are well correlated : both flux and luminosity correlations have a significance level larger than 99.9% using kendall s tau test , which takes the upper limits into account ( see tables  [ t : nucflux ] and [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the correlation is not due to selection effects or a common dependence on distance .",
    "figure  [ f : nucflux ] shows the correlation with the @xmath19-band nos , because the @xmath18-band nos can be more affected by dust obscuration .",
    "both nos emissions correlate well with the vlba radio core ( see tables  [ t : nucflux ] and  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "two of the five missing galaxies , ugc 7115 and 3c 449 both host a nos ( see table  [ t : nucflux ] ) but lack vlba observations for reasons unrelated to their properties ( see section  [ s : radioobs ] ) .",
    "no nos is detected in ngc 3801 , ngc 5127 and ngc 7052 , which could be due to large foreground dust obscuration ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : opticalcores ] ) .",
    "thus all missing objects might host a nos in principle .",
    "there is no a priori reason to believe that the missing targets will alter the correlation significantly . for five of the six upper limits , the nos flux , as expected from the radio - optical core correlation , would be difficult to detect ( cf.section  [ s : opticalcores ] ) .",
    "the slope of the correlation between the logarithm of the vlba core and the @xmath19-band optical core luminosities is @xmath51 ( see table  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "the slope for the @xmath18-band optical core is less constrained but slightly steeper : @xmath52 .",
    "thus the majority of the 21 fr i nuclei do show nos emission , which is roughly proportional to the radio core emission .",
    "chiaberge , capetti & celotti ( 1999 ) used hst / wfpc2 observations to determine optical core emission in all 33 fr i galaxies in the 3cr catalogue .",
    "they detected a nos in @xmath53 of the galaxies , dust could hide a nos in @xmath54 , and no nos was detected in @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the detection rates for the 3cr fr i sample and ugc fr i sample are similar .",
    "their nos measurements agree well with our results for the seven overlapping 3cr galaxies ( see section  [ s : opticalcores ] ) .",
    "chiaberge , capetti & celotti also found a linear correlation between radio and optical core flux .",
    "figure  [ f : nocradiocore ] show the @xmath19-band nos versus radio core flux for the 16 ugc galaxies and the 20 3cr galaxies which are not part of the ugc fr i sample .",
    "the radio core flux at 5 ghz is plotted for the galaxies taken from chiaberge , capetti & celotti , as listed in their paper . for the ugc",
    "fr i sample , the vla radio core flux at 1.49 ghz is actually plotted .",
    "the 5 ghz and 1.49 ghz observations have similar beamwidths .",
    "the measurements can therefore be compared directly under the assumption of flat spectral slopes .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption because the fluxes in the ugc fr i galaxies with both 5ghz and 1.49 ghz observations typically differ by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the combined sample of 37 fr i galaxies suggests a single relation between radio and optical core emission .",
    "the only outlier is 3c 386 . as discussed by chiaberge , capetti & celotti ( 1999 ) , 3c 386 displays broad h@xmath0 emission lines which is highly unusual for a fr i galaxy .",
    "we performed a linear regression fit using kaplan - meier residuals on the combined sample ( isobe , feigelson & nelson 1986 ) .",
    "the outlier 3c386 is excluded from the fit .",
    "both 3c 28 and 3c 314.1 are excluded from the fit as well because they have upper limits to both their radio and optical flux , which can not be dealt with by the fitting routine .",
    "the linear fit to the logarithms of optical core flux as a function of radio core flux is significant at the @xmath56 level and has a slope of @xmath57 .",
    "hence , both the 3cr and ugc sample of fr i galaxies indicate a linear relation between radio and optical core emission .",
    "the proportionality makes a common origin for the radio and optical core flux plausible .",
    "we should expect a correlation between nuclear optical core and central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission , given the correlations between the radio core and h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and between the radio and optical core .",
    "any correlation , if present , might show considerable scatter due to the larger errors in optical core and h@xmath0+[nii ] emission in comparison with the error in radio core flux .",
    "the central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission as a function of nos emission is shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ f : nucflux ] for 18 of the 21 galaxies .",
    "the three galaxies missing from the plot ; the cores of ngc 3801 , ngc 5127 and ngc 7052 are too obscured by dust to determine the nos flux ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : opticalcores ] ) .",
    "it is not expected that the missing galaxies bias the relation between h@xmath0+[nii ] and nos emission .",
    "the optical core and central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission are indeed correlated .",
    "the fluxes and luminosities are correlated at a significance larger than @xmath58 , using kendall s tau test ( see tables  [ t : nucflux ] and [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "there are two outliers from the general relation : ngc 4261 and ngc 2329 . in ngc 4261",
    "the nos is detected at the bottom of a dip in the central luminosity profile , which is due to dust obscuration .",
    "thus , the intrinsic nos flux might be severely dimmed . for ngc 2329",
    "there is no clear indication that its nos and/or h@xmath0+[nii ] emission flux is biased .",

    "possibly , an extra optical component ( e.g. , slightly extended optical jet ) in ngc 2329 causes an overestimate of the nos flux .",
    "the h@xmath0+[nii ] and optical emission measurements have similar errors .",

    "the best fit to the logarithms of the h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity as a function of the nos luminosity has a slope @xmath59 which is similar to the slope between h@xmath0+[nii ] and radio core emission ( table  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",

    "we see a trend instead of a scatter plot only if the central h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity is taken as the independent variable do ( figure  [ f : residuals ] ) .",
    "this is additional suppport for the view that the optical and radio core emission share a common origin .",
    "paper i discusses the dichotomy in apparent dust morphology : ( i ) dust disks , which appear as smooth ellipses and ( ii ) dust lanes , which are irregular dust filaments .",
    "this extended central dust , detected in 19 of the 21 ugc fr i galaxies , might potentially obscure a significant fraction of the central optical line and continuum emission .    as a general check if dust affects the measurements of the optical continuum and h@xmath0+[nii ] core emissions we checked for any correlation between the two core luminosities and iras far infrared luminosities which trace the extended hot dust ( possibly with additional emission from stars ) at 12 and 25 micron and cool dust at 60 and 100 micron ( e.g. , knapp , bies & van gorkom 1990 ) .",

    "another possibility is that the obscuration depends on the orientation of the central dust .",
    "for example , the amount of obscuration along the line of sight increases going from face - on disks to edge - on disks and/or dust lanes .",
    "could this induce the correlation between h@xmath0+[nii ] and optical core luminosity ?",
    "figure  [ f : nucflux ] shows that a large but not too unreasonable range in @xmath18-band dust opacity of @xmath60 tends to spread the observed luminosities roughly along the observed correlation , if the intrinsic luminosities were quite similar among the sample .",
    "however , there is no correlation between either h@xmath0+[nii ] or optical core luminosity and dust - disk inclination ( table  [ t : nuclum ] ; an inclination for the disks was derived by assuming intrinsically round disks , cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "the average h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity is slightly lower ( @xmath61 dex ) in dust - lane galaxies than in dust - disk galaxies .",

    "there is also no indication of significant foreground dust obscuration from the @xmath30 color of the optical core emission as a function of dust - disk inclination .",
    "only a statistically insignificant trend is present ( table  [ t : nuclum ] ) , for which the slope is too shallow to explain the observed range in luminosities .",
    "thus , foreground dust does not appear to systematically affect the h@xmath0+[nii ] and optical core emission .",
    "this makes it very unlikely as well , that dust obscuration induces the correlations of h@xmath0+[nii ] and optical core emission as a function of radio core emission , which extend over two decades or more in luminosity .",
    "could foreground dust obscuration cause the scatter in the correlations of optical core and h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity as a function of radio core luminosity ?",
    "the observed scatter of about one decade in both correlations requires a reasonable optical depth variation of @xmath62 between the least and most obscured cases in the ugc fr i sample ( see arrow in figure  [ f : nucflux ] ) .",

    "the conclusion from section  [ s : correlations ] is that the radio , optical and h@xmath0+[nii ] core emission are all mutually well correlated .",
    "the analysis indicates that the optical core emission is proportional to the radio core emission .",
    "the central h@xmath0+[nii ] emission is consistent with being roughly proportional to the square root of both optical and radio core emission .",
    "it is highly unlikely that variations in foreground dust obscuration cause the correlations between h@xmath0+[nii ] , optical and radio core emission .",
    "these correlations rather reflect physical connections between the three emissions .",
    "foreground dust is also unlikely to induce the scatter in the correlations .",

    "both m84 and m87 have optical core luminosities representative of the ugc fr i sample . thus for two typical members of the 21 ugc fr i galaxies it has been convincingly shown that the optical core emission source is not a stellar cluster but must be agn related .",

    "our nos fluxes agree within a factor of @xmath32 with measurements by ho ( 1999b ) for three overlapping targets .",
    "the agreements in the spatial extent and flux measurement of the nuclear optical emission support the idea that our simple method for detecting and measuring unresolved emission is accurate for our purposes .",

    "the agn - type liners and ugc fr i galaxies have similar nos and h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities .",
    "the liner h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities are measured in apertures of typically a few arcsecond radius and hence overestimate the core h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity .",

    "the stellar - type liners also have similar nos luminosities .",
    "ngc 4569 has a comparable h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity as well , but ngc 404 has an order of magnitude lower h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the upper limits to the radio core luminosities of the stellar - type liners are significantly below those of ugc fr i galaxies except for one ( ngc 6500 ) .",
    "thus , in general the agn - type liner nuclei resemble the ugc fr i nuclei in their core emission properties more closely than the stellar - type liners .",
    "it is especially the radio core luminosity that separates the stellar - type liners from the agn - type liners and ugc fr i galaxies .",
    "the core radio emission in the ugc fr i nuclei is certainly non - thermal agn emission ( cf .  section  [ s : jet ] ) .",
    "the resemblance with the agn - type liners suggest an agn source for the optical continuum and line emission in all ugc fr i nuclei is more likely than a stellar origin . it is unlikely that systematic differences in obscuration by central dust , which is is commonly present in both stellar- and agn - type liner and ugc fr i galaxies , conspire to produce the overlap and separation of the nuclear luminosities . indeed , the @xmath30 colors of the liner cores ( only available for ngc 4579 and ngc 4594 ) and the ugc fr i cores are similar .    we conclude that a stellar origin for the optical core emission is highly unlikely for two reasons .",
    "first , previous spectral studies have directly excluded a nuclear stellar cluster as the source of the optical core emission for two typical members of the ugc fr i sample .",
    "second , the ugc fr i nuclei resemble the nuclei of agn - type liners more closely than stellar - type liners in their radio and optical core and central h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosities .",
    "in contrast , an agn origin for the optical cores in all ugc fr i galaxies is strongly favored by the tight correlation with radio core emission , which is certainly produced by the agn .",
    "we shift our attention to a scenario in which the radio and optical core emission originate in the inner jet . the radio core emission in radio galaxies is generally thought to be self - absorbed non - thermal synchrotron emission because it has a high degree of polarization , a high brightness temperature and typically a flat spectral slope at radio wavelengths ( cf .",
    "krolik 1999 for a general discussion ) . the tight linear relation between radio and optical core flux ( see section  [ s : radionos ] ) then suggests that the optical core emission is also jet synchrotron emission .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare the cores to extended optical jets , in which both radio and optical emission are commonly thought to be synchrotron emission ( e.g. , lara et al .",
    "the radio - to - optical spectral index @xmath68 ( defined by @xmath69 ) of the ugc fr i cores varies between 0.44 and 0.86 using any combination of either @xmath18- or @xmath19-band nos and either vla or vlba core fluxes .",
    "these values are consistent with those found for extended optical jets in the ugc fr i sample : 3c 66b , 3c 264 and m87 ( butcher , van breugel & miley , 1980 ; biretta et al .",
    "1991 ; lara et al .",
    "the spectral index might be affected by core flux variability , because the optical and radio observations were made at different epochs . the optical cores in m84 and m87",
    "are known to vary by a factor of a few ( see section  [ s : cluster ] ) .",
    "not much is known about the flux variability of radio cores in fr i galaxies , but a factor of a few seems reasonable ( shukla & stoner 1996 ) . as an indication , a flux ratio variation of a factor of 10 results in @xmath68 variation of @xmath70 .",
    "although the @xmath18- and @xmath19-band observations were made at the same epoch , the @xmath18-to- @xmath19 spectral index , @xmath71 , is much less secure than @xmath68 , due to the large relative errors of the optical core fluxes and the shorter frequency range ( the error in @xmath71 is approximately 6 times the error in the logarithm of the flux ratio ) .",
    "we determined @xmath71 taking into account the filter passbands ( using calcphot in the iraf synphot package ) .",
    "extended optical jets have been detected in three ugc fr i galaxies : 3c 66b , 3c 264 and 3c 274 .",
    "the optical spectral index of the core emission is very similar to that of the extended jet emission in 3c 264 and m87 .",
    "the optical jet in 3c 66b is too faint to make a reliable comparison . for the complete sample of ugc fr i cores ,",
    "we determine @xmath72 typically , which is again in the same range as found for extended optical jets ( e.g. , crane et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ; biretta et al .  1991 ; martel et al .",
    "however , steeper spectral indices up to @xmath73 are observed as well .",
    "in addition to the large measurement uncertainty , any foreground dust ( either present in our galaxy or the galaxy itself ) will steepen the observed optical core spectral index .",
    "for example , if one uses the spectral flux density at 5500  and 8000  to compute the spectral index and assume foreground dust with galactic reddening law then @xmath74 .",
    "hence extinction from foreground dust could account for the steeper optical spectral indices .",
    "thus two conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , the tight linear correlation between optical and radio core flux strongly suggests that also the optical cores are synchrotron emission .",
    "second , the similarities in radio and optical emission from extended jets are consistent with both core emissions originating in an unresolved inner jet .      if indeed radio and optical core emission originate in the inner jet both continuum emissions could be significantly doppler boosted .",
    "this is in contrast with the h@xmath0+[nii ] core emission , which is very likely not doppler boosted .",
    "we will assume in the following that the h@xmath0+[nii ] flux is emitted isotropically and not affected by dust obscuration , based on the results in section  [ s : obscuration ] .",
    "we will further assume that the radio and optical core emission originates from a symmetric jet .",

    "we will consider two cases : ( i ) a continuous jet isotropically emitting in the source rest - frame ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) and ( ii ) a jet consisting of discrete blobs isotropically emitting in the source rest - frame ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) ( see e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "for simplicity we will assume a flat core radio spectrum in the source rest frame ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) .    in appendix",
    "[ a : beaming ] we determine the effect of doppler boosting on the observed correlation of fluxes which are intrinsically related by a power law .",
    "the main effect is to introduce scatter in the observed relationship . the scatter increases with @xmath77 for a given @xmath80 and given range in jet viewing angles .",
    "we will first infer @xmath77 assuming that the viewing angles , @xmath79 , are randomly spherically distributed in the range @xmath3 $ ] , which is plausible for the ugc fr i jets ( see also section  [ s : accretion ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the critical dependence of the results on the assumed range in viewing angles .",
    "thus we can infer a typical @xmath77 for the sample from the observed standard deviation of @xmath84 for the linear regression fit of the vlba radio core flux as a function of h@xmath0+[nii ] flux in log - log space .",

    "thus , adaf type models seem to provide a reasonable global fit to the nuclear seds of agn - type liners which are similar to ugc fr i agns , but tend to underpredict the optical and radio core flux in ugc fr i galaxies . for the well - studied galaxy m87 , jet viewing angles in the range @xmath112",
    "have been reported ( biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ; biretta et al .",
    "1999 ) . already for @xmath113 , logarithmic doppler boosting factors @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "[ s : boosting ] ) vary by @xmath114 and @xmath115 between viewing angles @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "thus the factors by which the optical and radio core emission is underpredicted in the adaf model for m87 could be on the order of the variation in doppler deboosting factors with jet viewing angle .",
    "m87 , the nearest galaxy in the sample , offers the possiblity to directly localize the origin of the radio core emission at the highest attainable spatial resolution .",
    "junor , biretta & livio ( 1999 ) obtained extreme high - resolution vlbi imaging ( beam size 0.33mas x 0.12mas ) at 43 ghz of the core of m87 .",
    "the image shows that the jet does not obtain its final collimation ( as observed at pc and kpc scale ) until a few parsec from the core . even at this high spatial resolution",
    ", there is still a dominant core component of size @xmath118mas .",
    "this corresponds to 0.04 pc or 130 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath119 ) for m87 .",
    "the peak flux density is 228 mjy / beam , while the vlba core flux density at 1.49 ghz is 1570 mjy / beam at a resolution of 10mas x 10mas .",
    "hence a decrease by a factor of 2500 in beam area corresponds to only a decrease by a factor 7 in peak flux density .",
    "the vlba core emission could therefore originate at the same scale as the vlbi core emission .",
    "the flux difference might then be due to radio core variability .",
    "alternatively , the flux difference between 1.4 ghz and 43 ghz corresponds to a radio spectral index of 0.57 .",
    "thus , it is possible for at least m87 that the vlba core flux ( fwhm @xmath120 ) is dominated by a nuclear component which resides at radii smaller than those where jet collimation takes place .    optical spectral indices for an adaf can vary considerably as a function of mass accretion rate ( narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , the radio spectral index between @xmath121 ghz is always inverted with @xmath122 ( yi & boughn 1998 ) compared to @xmath123 typically for jet models .",
    "table  [ t : spectralindex ] lists the radio spectral index between the 1.49 ghz / 1.67 ghz and 5 ghz core fluxes .",
    "core flux variability would have a significant effect on the derived spectral index due to the small frequency range : a factor of two change in the flux density ratio would result in a change by 0.6 in the derived spectral index . for the spectral index between 1.49 ghz and 5 ghz , for which the observations have similar resolution , 7 out of 10 sources",
    "have spectra with @xmath124 . for the spectral index between 1.67 ghz and 5 ghz only 2 out of 10 have @xmath124 .",
    "however , in the latter case @xmath0 is a lower limit as the 5 ghz flux is measured at lower resolution than the 1.67 ghz vlba measurements .",
    "we conclude that at the _ arcsecond _ scale the radio cores are most likely dominated by the typical flat spectrum of a jet component instead of a second non - relativistic component .",
    "however , it is unclear at this point whether jet synchrotron or a second component , such as adaf synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission , dominates the @xmath125 scale optical and @xmath126 scale radio core emission in all ugc fr i galaxies .",
    "addressing this issue will require knowledge of the core seds from radio to x - ray frequencies , constraints on jet viewing angles and accretion flow and jet modeling .",
    "both the compactness of the core h@xmath0+[nii ] emission and its strong correlation with the radio and optical core emission from the agn indicate that the emission gas is excited by an agn - related process .",
    "the existence of young nuclear star clusters , which could also produce the compact h@xmath0+[nii ] emission , appears unlikely ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : cluster ] ) .",
    "excitation by old stars from the host galaxy appears implausible as well , because the core h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity does not correlate with either host magnitude or central stellar surface brightness ( as measured just outside the optical core ; cf .  table  [ t : nuclum ] ) .",
    "two viable agn - related excitation mechanisms are photo- and shock - ionization . on the one hand",
    "the gas is very close to the agn which is generally believed to produce a significant amount of photo - ionizing photons . on the other hand jets are present , which might shock the central gas . for extended gas at kiloparsec scales in nearby radio - loud galaxies ( both fr i and fr iis ) both excitation mechanisms often provide good fits to the observed optical emission - line ratios ( e.g. , baum , heckman & van breugel 1992 ; simpson & ward 1996 ) .",
    "this degeneracy can be lifted by observing uv emission - lines , for which the relative intensities are significantly larger in the case of shock - ionization compared to photo - ionization ( allen , dopita & tsvetanov 1998 ) .",
    "this approach shows for m87 that the gas as close as 50 pc from the nucleus is almost certainly shock - excited ( dopita et al .",
    "1997 ) . as a reference , the core h@xmath0+[nii ]",
    "flux in m87 contributes about 20% to the total flux inside an aperture with a 50 pc radius and this radius is typically about the size of the fwhm ( @xmath127 ) of our h@xmath0+[nii ] cores .",
    "m87 is a special case in the sense that it sits at the center of a cooling flow which might cause enhancement of shock excitation .",
    "photons ionizing the gas can be produced by the accretion disk and jet .",
    "however , any photo - ionizing flux from the jet is highly beamed even for the relatively low lorentz factors inferred in section  [ s : boosting ] .",
    "the typical opening angle due to boosting , @xmath128 ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) is @xmath129 and @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively .",
    "photo - ionization by the accretion disk appears more likely .",
    "thus agn processes certainly excite the central gas in the ugc fr i galaxies but it can not be determined at this point whether shock- or photo - ionization is the dominant mechanism .",
    "we have recently obtained hst / stis optical spectra which can shed more light on this issue ( noel - storr et al .",
    "how similar are the central engines of ugc fr i nuclei and agn - type liner nuclei which have radio cores but no large - scale radio jets ? the radio and optical core emission properties of the three agn - type liners discussed in section  [ s : cluster ] roughly follow the core emission correlations found for the ugc fr i sample galaxies .",
    "for this reason we construct a larger sample of nearby early - type galaxies with liner type nuclei and radio core emission .",
    "ho et al .  ( 1995,1997 ) identified liner nuclei among a sample of 486 nearby galaxies in the rsa catalogue ( rsa ; sandage & tammann 1981 ) .",
    "many of these liner nuclei were surveyed for radio core emission by wrobel & heeschen ( 1991 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) inferred brightness temperatures @xmath133k from higher resolution radio observations for a few agn - type liners .",
    "further support for an agn interpretation comes from the fact that the five ugc fr i nuclei in the ho  et al .  sample ( ngc 315 , ngc 4261 , ngc 4374 , ngc 4486 and ngc 7626 ) are also classified as liner nuclei .",

    "an offset remains when one takes the radio core emission for the ugc fr i sample at different resolutions ( i.e. , the 1.4 ghz or 5 ghz vla observations ) .",
    "the cores of the ugc fr i sample are expected to have flat radio seds as function of @xmath137 so frequency differences are not expected to alter the observed offset significantly . in the luminosity - luminosity plane",
    "the liner sample seems less offset , but this could be due to the fact that both quantities depend on distance . the offset is smaller for the elliptical liner galaxies than later - type liner galaxies .",
    "in fact , the elliptical liner galaxies are consistent with following the luminosity correlation of the ugc fr i sample .",
    "this was also noted by ho ( 1999a ) who argued that a correlation is present even after taking into account the common dependence on distance and host magnitude .",
    "the h@xmath0+[nii ] emission for the two samples is integrated over similar apertures , while the core emission for the ugc fr i sample is observed at much smaller resolution than the core emission for the liner sample .",

    "conclusions 1 to 5 prompt us to make the following speculation : if the radio and optical core emission are indeed inner jet synchrotron emission , then their strong correlation with h@xmath0+[nii ] core emission implies either a direct link between jet luminosity and gas excitation power , possibly via jet - gas interactions or a close relation between agn photo - ionizing power and jet radiative ( and possibly kinetic ) power .",
