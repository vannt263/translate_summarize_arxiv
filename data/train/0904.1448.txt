    "over the course of the past few decades , li abundances have been measured for many metal - poor main - sequence turn - off stars , in hopes of placing constraints on the nature of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the first such investigation , by @xcite , revealed that warm metal - poor main - sequence stars exhibited a constant li abundance .",
    "this so - called spite plateau was interpreted as a result of the synthesis of light nuclei in the first several minutes of the evolution of the universe ( it is conventionally assumed that li is not destroyed at the surface of such stars because of their shallow surface convection zones ) . since then , measurements of li abundances have been obtained over wide ranges of effective temperature and metallicity , confirming that the scatter of the li abundances in most stars with @xmath7@xmath8  k and [ fe / h]@xmath9 is small , if present at all ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "= @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for elements a and b. lithium abundances are conventionally presented as @xmath3(li ) instead of @xmath12 . ]",
    "however , it has been recognized that the spite plateau value of a(li ) ( @xmath13 ) is 0.30.4  dex lower than the li abundance predicted by standard bbn models @xcite , adopting the baryon density determined by recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation with the wmap satellite @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy indicates the existence of poorly understood processes that deplete li in metal - poor turn - off stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , astration of li in the gas that formed these stars ( perhaps by massive zero - metallicity progenitors ; piau et al .",
    "2006 ) , problems in the measured abundances of li in metal - poor stars , systematic uncertainties in the standard bbn model predictions , or exotic processes in the early universe arising from nonstandard particle physics ( cyburt et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "recent measurements of very metal - poor turn - off stars also suggest a decreasing trend of li abundances with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite investigated the li abundances for a sample that includes eight stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 .",
    "they showed that the li abundances of these stars are lower than those of stars with higher metallicity , investigating very carefully the scatter and trend of li abundances with metallicity and effective temperature .",
    "another unsolved problem is the low li abundance found in he  13272326 , a hyper metal - poor turn - off star having [ fe / h]@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "only an upper - limit on the li abundance has been determined , @xmath3(li)@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although the star has probably evolved to the subgiant branch @xcite , the effective temperature of this object ( 6180  k ; frebel et al .",
    "2005 ) is still sufficiently high that depletion of li by surface convection is not expected .",
    "another possible explanation for the apparent depletion of li is mass accretion from an evolved companion star @xcite , in particular because this star is highly carbon - enhanced ( [ c / fe ] @xmath16 ; aoki et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , no signature of binarity has been found yet for this object @xcite .",
    "thus , concerning the @xmath17li abundances in very metal - poor stars , we are confronted with three problems : ( 1 ) the discrepancy between the observed spite plateau value and the prediction of standard bbn models adopting the baryon density determined by cmb measurements ; ( 2 ) a possible trend of the li abundance as a function of metallicity in extremely metal - poor stars ; and ( 3 ) the low li abundance in he  13272326 ( see also the summary by piau et al .",
    "although possible connections between the above three problems are still unknown , we have obtained measurements of li abundances for several extremely metal - poor turn - off stars in a search for hints to solving these li puzzles .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of li abundances for very and extremely metal - poor stars .",

    "the two objects from the sdss sample were observed in a program for carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars @xcite . although these two stars were selected as candidate cemp turn - off stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath18 , they turned out to show no clear carbon excess in our high - resolution spectroscopy , thus were good targets for studying the li abundances in the extremely low metallicity range .",

    "spectra of this wavelength region are shown in figure  [ fig : sp ] .",
    "equivalent widths of fe , na , mg , and sr lines were measured by fitting gaussian profiles , in order to determine atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions . since the @xmath266708 line consists of a doublet , gaussian fitting is not appropriate for the measurement of equivalent widths . instead , we determined the li abundances by fitting synthetic spectra (  [ sec : liana ] ) . for comparisons of equivalent widths with previous studies , we measured the equivalent widths of this line from the synthetic spectra (  [ sec : ana ] ) that provided the best fits to the observed ones .",
    "the equivalent widths of the interstellar d lines , which can be used to estimate the interstellar reddening (  [ sec : ana ] ) , were measured by direct integration of the absorption features .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities listed in table  [ tab : obs ] were measured from the same clean lines that were used to determine iron abundances .",
    "the uncertainty given in table  [ tab : obs ] is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the standard deviation of the measurements and @xmath29 is the number of lines used . in addition , one should take into account possible small systematic errors due to the instability of the instrument , which are at most 0.4  km  s@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the effective temperatures ( @xmath7 s ) of our program stars were determined from profile fits to hydrogen balmer lines , a technique used as well by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we employed the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines [ @xmath7(h@xmath1 ) and @xmath7(h@xmath2 ) ] .",
    "although h@xmath31 is also covered by our observations , it lies at the edge of the ccd , making continuum rectification difficult , and thus has not been used .",
    "the method for continuum rectification of the observed spectra and analysis used follows exactly that described in @xcite , which may be consulted for details .",
    "the most important aspects of the analysis are that the synthetic profiles are computed assuming lte line formation using 1d lte plane - parallel marcs models @xcite , with convection described by mixing length theory with parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the most important line - broadening mechanisms for the wings are stark broadening and self broadening , which are described by calculations of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the fitting is accomplished by minimisation of the @xmath34 statistic , comparing the observed and synthetic profiles .",
    "essentially the same method was used by @xcite , although with some differences in the rectification and profile comparison techniques .",
    "we note that the assumption of lte for formation of the balmer line wings in cool stars has recently been shown to be questionable on the basis of theoretical non - lte calculations @xcite , the role of hydrogen collisions being a major uncertainty .",
    "those calculations admit that the temperatures from lte balmer line wings could be systematically too cool by of order 100  k if hydrogen collisions are inefficient , although lte is not ruled out . due to the fact that there is no strong evidence favoring any particular hydrogen collision model , we chose to calculate in lte as this temperature scale is well studied , and it is computationally most practical .",
    "however , we emphasize that lte is not a safe middle ground , and will lead to temperatures systematically too cool should departures from lte exist in reality .",
    "often , h@xmath1 is given higher weight than higher series lines such as h@xmath2 for reasons discussed by @xcite . however , in extremely metal - poor turn - off stars this is no longer obvious since blending by metal lines becomes unimportant , and h@xmath2 becomes in fact almost insensitive to gravity , while h@xmath1 is quite gravity sensitive ( see table 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "further , the calculations by @xcite suggest that non - lte effects , if they exist , will be largest in h@xmath1 .",
    "thus , in combining the temperatures from h@xmath1 and h@xmath35 , we have in fact given h@xmath2 double the weight of h@xmath1 .",
    "the derived effective temperatures are dependent on the gravity assumed in the calculation .",
    "the analysis is iterated for the gravity , which is determined from the analysis of the high - resolution spectrum (   [ sec : ana ] ) for each object .",
    "the results and uncertainties of the @xmath7 determinations are listed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the uncertainties listed in the tables are estimated from the quality of the spectrum and the fit .    for comparison purposes , we also estimated the effective temperatures from the @xmath36 colors [ @xmath7@xmath37 , using the effective temperature scales of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for the estimates using the scale of @xcite , we assume [ fe / h]@xmath38 for stars having [ fe / h]@xmath39 following @xcite . the photometry data were collected from @xcite , the 2mass catalogue @xcite , and the simbad database",
    ". the @xmath40 magnitudes of the sdss stars are derived from the @xmath41 magnitude and @xmath42 color , as in @xcite .",
    "interstellar reddening is estimated from the dust maps of @xcite and from the interstellar d line , using the scale of @xcite ; results are listed in table  [ tab : teff ] .",
    "we adopt the reddening estimate obtained from the na d line for the brightest four stars ( hd  84937 , bd+26@xmath193578 , g  6412 and g  6437 ) because these are nearby stars , and the reddening might be overestimated from the dust maps .",
    "the interstellar na d lines blend with the stellar lines in the spectrum of he  11480037 , so the reddening value from the dust map is adopted for this object . for the other six objects , the averages of the reddening values derived from the two methods are adopted .",
    "the differences between the @xmath43 values based on the two methods are generally 0.01 mag or smaller .",
    "the exception is for cs  22965054 , which exhibits the largest @xmath43 among the sample , @xmath44 from the dust map and 0.13 from the na d line .",

    "the differences between the results from @xcite and from @xcite are 100 - 150  k. the results from @xcite are 100 - 200  k higher still than those from @xcite for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath0 , while the agreement is fairly good for the three stars having higher metallicity ( shown by smaller symbols in the figure ) .",
    "these differences between the effective temperature scales were already reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the comparisons with the results from balmer line analyses indicate that the effective temperatures from the scale of @xcite agree in general with those from the balmer lines .",
    "the star showing the largest discrepancy is sdss  0040 + 16 .",

    "the results from the scales of @xcite and @xcite for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath0 are systematically higher than those from balmer lines by 150  k and 250  k , respectively .",
    "determination of the li abundance is sensitive to the effective temperatures adopted in the analysis .",
    "we discuss the impact of effective temperatures on the metallicity dependence of li abundances in   [ sec : disc ]",
    ".    the estimate of effective temperatures for extremely metal - poor stars from these temperature scales would be rather uncertain , because of the small number of stars in the sample used to produce the scales .",
    "@xcite includes a very small number of stars for the ranges of the color and metallicity .",
    "@xcite increased the number of such stars , which are used to produce the scale of @xcite .",
    "however , the sample is still not large ( 10 stars ) and includes one carbon - enhanced star and two known double - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "further measurements of effective temperatures by the infrared flux method are desired for this metallicity range .",
    "the abundance analyses were made using the grid of atlas9 newodf model atmospheres @xcite , with enhancement of the @xmath1-elements .",
    "calculations of synthetic spectra for abundance analyses were made employing a 1d - lte spectral synthesis code that is based on the same assumptions as the model atmosphere program of @xcite .",
    "the surface gravities ( @xmath47 ) are estimated from the effective temperatures and @xmath48 isochrones @xcite for [ fe / h]=@xmath49 ( for hd  84937 and bd+26@xmath193578 ) and [ fe / h ] @xmath50 ( for the others ) assuming the ages of these stars to be 12  gyr . for the @xmath7 range of our sample , two possibilities of @xmath47 exist : the subgiant case ( @xmath47@xmath51 ) and the main - sequence case ( @xmath47@xmath52 ) .",
    "we performed abundance analyses for and ( see below for details ) , and selected the @xmath47 that provides better agreement of iron abundances from the two species for each star .",
    "the derived @xmath47 value is not sensitive to the assumption of the age for selecting isochrones .",

    "doppler corrections for the observed spectra are determined by the line positions used for the above abundance measurements . in the fitting procedure for the four bright stars ( hd  84937 , bd+26@xmath193578 , g  6412 and g  6437 ) ,",
    "a small wavelength shift is included as a fitting parameter ( see below ) .",
    "the continuum level is estimated from the wavelength range around the li line ( 6706.96707.4   and 6708.26708.7   ) .",
    "the list of the li lines provided by @xcite is adopted , neglecting the contribution of @xmath60li .",
    "we assume a gaussian profile to account for the broadening by macro - turbulence , including rotation , and by the instrument .",
    "we assume a broadening of 7  km  s@xmath30 for the stars observed with @xmath61 , and 8  km  s@xmath30 for the others , values that sufficiently explain the widths of weak fe lines .",
    "we performed the analyses changing the value by @xmath62  km  s@xmath30 , and confirmed that the effect of the assumed line broadening on the derived @xmath17li abundance is small ( @xmath63  dex ) .",
    "we then search for the li abundance that yields the minimum @xmath64 .",
    "we found that the fit is slightly improved by allowing a small wavelength shift for the four brightest stars , while the effect is negligible for the others .",
    "hence , in our procedure for fitting of the synthetic spectra to the observations , the free parameter was the li abundance , and for the four brightest stars also a wavelength shift . the number of data points to which the fitting is applied is 18 and 36 for the cases of two pixel binning and of no binning , respectively .",

    "such a difference can obviously be produced by a decreasing trend ( slope ) of @xmath3(li ) as a function of metallicity .",
    "the possible slope of @xmath3(li ) was discussed by @xcite in detail .",
    "however , no clear physical reason for the slope , which appears only at the lowest metallicity range , has yet been identified .",
    "another possibility is that scatter of @xmath3(li ) increases in the range [ fe / h ] @xmath18 , and , as a result , the average decreases .",
    "this case would be relatively easily explained by depletion of li , although some reason for the metallicity dependence of the depletion is also required .",
    "if the effective temperatures estimated from the @xmath36 colors using the scales of @xcite and @xcite are employed , the li abundances of our stars would be systematically higher .",
    "the effective temperatures derived using the scale of @xcite are systematically higher by 220  k and 150  k than the values from the balmer line analysis for emp stars and for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath76 , respectively , resulting in 0.15  dex and 0.10  dex higher li abundances .",
    "although the difference of li abundances between the emp stars and less metal - poor stars becomes slightly smaller than the result derived adopting the effective temperature from the balmer line analysis , the difference is still significant .",
    "by contrast , if the effective temperatures estimated using the scales of @xcite are adopted , the values are 290  k and 150  k higher than those from the balmer lines , resulting in 0.20  dex and 0.10  dex higher li abundances . in this case ,",

    "for instance , even if the stars with the largest measurement errors are excluded from the evaluation , a similar scatter of @xmath3(li ) remains .",
    "a difference of 0.14  dex is found in @xmath3(li ) for the two bright stars g  6412 and g  6437 , as found by @xcite and @xcite . in this subsection",

    "figure  [ fig : liteff ] shows @xmath3(li ) as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "no clear correlation can be seen in this figure .",
    "it should be noted that the random error of the effective temperature propagates into the derived li abundance , which is represented by the arrows shown in the diagram .",
    "an increasing trend of li abundance with decreasing @xmath7 is potentially influenced by this error .",
    "our sample includes stars that have already evolved to the subgiant branch .",
    "their effective temperatures during the main - sequence stage should be higher than the current values , and might be as high as the hottest stars among the main - sequence sample .",
    "the stars having @xmath87 are over - plotted by large circles representing candidate subgiants in the figure . if these stars are excluded , we find that stars cooler than 6150  k exhibit higher and almost constant li abundances , while the warmer stars show some scatter",
    ". however , this probably reflects a metallicity effect , as the cooler stars ( excluding subgiants ) are objects having [ fe / h ] @xmath88 studied by @xcite , while the warmer stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath89 .",
    "that is , the sample of very metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath90 ) have @xmath7@xmath91  k , or are subgiants .",
    "this could be due to a bias in the sample selection caused by the fact that distant stars must be observed to cover lower metallicity ranges , and intrinsically faint stars are not sampled .",
    "other than this point , no clear correlation appears between the li abundances and effective temperature , even if subgiants are removed from the plot , or if the highest temperature among the sample ( @xmath92  k ) is assigned for them as their @xmath7 during their main - sequence phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : limgsr ] shows li abundances as functions of [ na / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] , and [ sr / fe ] .",
    "an anti - correlation between the li abundance and the [ na / fe ] ratio was reported for the globular cluster ngc  6752 by @xcite .",
    "such a trend is , however , not seen in our sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : limgsr ] ) : the two low li stars he  11480037 and sdss  0040 + 16 have comparatively high [ na / fe ] ratios , while that of the other low li star , cs  22948093 , is low . if the nlte effects on the na abundances are taken into consideration , the abundances of less metal - poor stars become lower by about 0.3  dex .",
    "however , this correction does not result in any correlation between the li and na abundances .",
    "no significant scatter is found for [ mg / fe ] in our sample .",
    "also , no correlation is found between the abundances of li and the mg abundances .",
    "in contrast , a large scatter of measured sr abundances exists , which could reflect the contribution of a neutron - capture process that is efficient in the very early galaxy @xcite , as well as the contribution of the main r - process to higher metallicity objects . no correlation is found between the li and sr abundances , indicating that the li production or depletion is not likely to be related to neutron - capture nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "we are also interested in exploring whether the kinematics of the stars with lower @xmath3(li ) exhibit any peculiarities that distinguish them from the rest of the stars . for this exercise",
    ", we combined our present sample with that of bonifacio et al .",
    "proper motions of sdss stars are listed in the public dr6 database , while those of other stars are taken from the nomad database ( zacharias et al .",

    "the adopted surface gravities , metallicities , photometry , distances , radial velocities , and proper motions are listed in table  [ tab : kine1 ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : kine ] shows the derived rotational velocity with respect to the galactic center , @xmath96 , as a function of [ fe / h ] . the stars with low values of @xmath3(li ) are labeled by filled circles .",
    "we note that three stars with `` normal '' @xmath3(li ) are on highly prograde orbits ( an additional star , cs  310610032 , with @xmath96 = 205  km  s@xmath30 , may be a member of the metal - weak thick disk ) .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected , given the essentially zero net rotation of the inner halo , and net retrograde rotation of the outer halo .",
    "we plan to study these stars in more detail in the near future .",
    "based on the derived space velocities and orbital parameters , an attempt was made to assign approximate population memberships for these stars , listed in the second column of table  [ tab : kine2 ] .",
    "the assignments take into account the values of the velocity ellipsoids derived for the inner and outer halo , and the thick disk ( including the metal - weak thick disk ; d. carollo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , as well as the derived @xmath97 ( the maximum distance from the galactic plane in the vertical direction ) for each star .",
    "we did not attempt to assign a membership to the four highly prograde stars , because , as was mentioned above , they require further investigation ( fi in the second column of table  [ tab : kine2 ] ) .",
    "note that in some cases it was not possible to uniquely distinguish a single population assignment , so multiple assignments are given .",
    "inspection of these assignments indicates no tendency for the stars with low @xmath3(li ) to be associated preferentially with either the inner- or outer - halo populations .",
    "this is similar to the conclusions drawn by bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on inspection of radial velocities alone .",
    "however , the sample size ( especially of low @xmath3(li ) stars ) and the existing errors on the li abundance determinations preclude a final determination .",
    "our measurements of the li doublet for extremely metal - poor stars based on the effective temperatures from the balmer lines showed that the li abundances in the metallicity range [ fe / h ] @xmath6 are lower , on average , than for stars with higher metallicity .",
    "the same conclusion is also reached by adopting the effective temperatures from @xmath36 using the scales of @xcite and @xcite , although the li abundances are systematically higher if the latter is adopted .",
    "if the temperature scale of @xcite for @xmath36 is adopted , the dependence of the li abundances on metallicity becomes marginal .",
    "although no scatter or trend of li abundances is detected within the sample of extremely metal - poor stars , the metallicity dependence of the li abundance could be a key to understanding the li problems found for metal - poor stars .",
    "observations to obtain better quality spectra for such extremely metal - poor stars , to improve measurements of the li feature itself , as well as for improved determination of @xmath7 from the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 profiles , will provide a useful constraint on the possible scenarios proposed to explain the li problems .",
    "moreover , measurements of li abundances for even lower metallicity stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath98 ) are also vital",
