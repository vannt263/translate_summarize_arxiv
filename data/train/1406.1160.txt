    "there has been significant interest in _ ab initio _ solutions for systems of neutron drops trapped in external potentials aimed at providing insights into properties of unstable neutron - rich nuclei and neutron star matter @xcite . at the same time , comparisons of neutron drop results using different microscopic interactions provide information on the isovector part of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction and the @xmath4 component of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) interaction . with these goals in mind ,",
    "we present the first _ ab initio _",
    "results for pure neutron systems using chiral nn+3n hamiltonians in an external trap and compare with results previously obtained using high - precision phenomenological nn+3n hamiltonians .    we adopt no - core configuration interaction methods ( e.g. , see refs .",

    "we follow refs .",
    "@xcite for the configuration interaction approach to trapped neutron drops in the current application .    at the same time",
    ", significant theoretical advances regarding the underlying hamiltonians , constructed within chiral effective field theory ( eft ) , provide a firm foundation for nuclear many - body calculations rooted in qcd @xcite , leading us to adopt a chiral eft hamiltonian here .",
    "we also make use of the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) approach @xcite that provides a straightforward and flexible framework for consistently evolving ( softening ) the hamiltonian and other operators , including 3n interactions  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we aim to provide results for neutron drop systems in a 10 mev harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) trap using realistic chiral nn+3n interactions with uncertainty estimates where feasible .",
    "second , we present comparisons between our results and those of other high - quality nn+3n interactions .",
    "in particular , we compare with results obtained using the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) and auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite , where the argonne @xmath3 ( av8@xmath5 ) nn interaction  @xcite was used in conjunction with the urbana ix ( uix ) 3n interaction  @xcite and with the illinois-7 ( il7 ) 3n interaction  @xcite .",
    "we limit our investigations to a single form of the chiral nn+3n interaction .",
    "that is , we use the chiral nn interaction at n@xmath6lo  with 500mev / c cutoff from ref .  @xcite together with the chiral 3n interaction at n@xmath7lo  @xcite in the local form of ref .",
    "@xcite for 500mev / c cutoff with low - energy constants determined entirely in the three - nucleon sector @xcite .",
    "this is also the hamiltonian used in refs .",
    "@xcite for _ ab initio _ studies of nuclear properties .",
    "we evolve this hamiltonian using the free - space srg to two representative flow parameters or momentum scales to examine the scale - dependence of our results . as in the earlier applications , we retain the induced many - body interactions up to the three - nucleon level and neglect induced four - nucleon ( and beyond ) interactions . depending on whether the initial chiral 3n interaction is included or not we use the term nn+3n - full or nn+3n - induced , respectively , to characterize the srg - evolved hamiltonian .    in selected cases , we also compare our results with those obtained using jisp16 @xcite , a nonlocal nn potential without 3n interactions .",
    "the neutron drop results with jisp16 have appeared previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in section  [ sec : back ] , we briefly review the formalism and summarize related results from previous work .",
    "the results for our neutron drop observables are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions and provides perspectives on future efforts .",
    "we employ _ ab initio _ configuration interaction and coupled - cluster methods to solve for the properties of neutron drops . in the first approach , the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) , we follow refs .",
    "@xcite where , for a given nn and 3n interaction we diagonalize the resulting many - body hamiltonian in a sequence of truncated ho basis spaces .",
    "these basis spaces are characterized by two parameters : @xmath8 specifies the maximum number of total ho quanta above the lowest allowed ho slater determinant and @xmath9 specifies the ho energy of the basis .",
    "this latter variable is distinct from the ho energy of the trap which is fixed to be 10 mev in the present application .",
    "the goal is to achieve convergence as indicated by independence from these two basis parameters .",
    "we also employ an extension of the ncsm , the importance truncated ncsm ( it - ncsm ) , for which we follow refs .",
    "@xcite where subspaces of the @xmath8-truncated spaces are dynamically selected according to an importance measure derived from perturbation theory .",
    "the it - ncsm uses this importance measure @xmath10 for the individual many - body basis states and retains only states with @xmath11 above a threshold @xmath12 in the model space . through a variation of this threshold and an _ a posteriori _",
    "extrapolation @xmath13 the contribution of discarded states is recovered .",
    "we use the sequential update scheme discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which connects to the full ncsm model space and , thus , the exact ncsm results in the limit of vanishing threshold .",
    "we recently compared the it - ncsm with the ncsm in basis spaces where calculations in both approaches are feasible  @xcite .    for neutron",
    "drops that exhibit subshell closure we apply the coupled - cluster ( cc ) method which is capable of providing results for heavier systems .",
    "we use single - reference cc with singles and doubles excitations  @xcite , in which the ground state @xmath14 of a many - body hamiltonian is parametrized by the exponential ansatz , where @xmath15 are @xmath16-particle-@xmath16-hole excitation operators acting on a single slater - determinant reference state @xmath17 , which is the hartree - fock determinant in our calculations .",
    "effects of the @xmath18 clusters are included through an _ a posteriori _ correction to the energy via the @xmath19  @xcite method .",
    "the underlying single - particle basis is an ho basis truncated in the principal oscillator quantum number . in this work",
    "we quote results from @xmath20 = 12 model spaces that are sufficiently well converged . including explicit 3n interactions into cc calculations results in a significant increase of the computational expense  @xcite . to facilitate the calculations",
    ", we use the normal - ordered two - body approximation ( no2b )  @xcite to the 3n interaction , which was shown to be very accurate in calculations of atomic nuclei  @xcite . in the no2b approximation ,",
    "contributions of the 3n interaction are demoted to lower particle ranks through normal - ordering techniques , and the residual normal - ordered three - body operator is discarded  @xcite . due to their enormous number ,",
    "not all of the 3n matrix elements that would be required by the large model spaces employed by the cc method can be included in the normal - ordering procedure .",
    "for that reason we impose an energy truncation @xmath21 on the 3n matrix elements .",
    "we have checked that our results are converged with respect to this truncation .",
    "we adopt the chiral nn+3n interaction described above as this hamiltonian has been applied in a range of _ ab initio _ calculations of light and medium - mass nuclei  @xcite . for",

    "is constrained by the total number of required 3n interaction matrix elements as well as by the number of many - body matrix elements that are computed and stored for the iterative lanczos diagonalization algorithm . through an efficient @xmath24-coupled storage scheme and",
    "an on - the - fly decoupling during the calculation of the many - body hamilton matrix @xcite , the limit arising from handling the 3n matrix elements has been pushed to significantly larger model spaces .    for the full ncsm calculations we employ the mfdn code  @xcite that is highly optimized for parallel computing .",
    "in order to exploit parallel architectures that include gpus , such as the titan facility at oak ridge national laboratory , we have developed and implemented new algorithms that significantly speed up the required decoupling transformations  @xcite .",
    "the it - ncsm calculations are performed with a dedicated code that has been developed to accommodate the specific demands of an importance - truncated calculation in a framework optimized for parallel performance . due to the reduction of the model - space dimension resulting from the importance truncation ,",
    "typically by two orders of magnitude , the many - neutron hamiltonian matrix is significantly smaller and the memory needs are drastically reduced .",
    "the cc calculations are performed based on a highly - efficient angular - momentum coupled implementation @xcite .",
