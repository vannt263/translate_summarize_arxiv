    "this method can also be used for weakly active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , such as low - luminosity agns , liners , and seyfert  2s ( table  1 ) . for more luminous agns ( type  1 sources ) the strong nuclear emission washes out the stellar features in the spectrum .",

    "the _ rms _ velocity width and time lag for different broad emission lines correlate such that higher ionization lines have larger widths and smaller lags ( consistent with the same central mass for each object ) .",
    "this virial relationship for multiple lines is seen for all four agns for which this is testable ( ngc7469 , ngc3783 , ngc5548 , 3c390.3 ) and for the well - measured emission lines of siiv @xmath41400 , civ @xmath41549 , heii @xmath41640 , ciii ] @xmath41909 , h@xmath5 @xmath4 4861 , and heii @xmath44686 ( peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson 2002 ) .",

    "since the primary mass determination methods are either inapplicable or impractical for more luminous and more distant agns and quasars , several secondary methods have been adopted in the literature to _ estimate _ the central mass .",
    "these methods , summarized in table  2 , are either approximations to the reverberation mapping technique or rely on the empirical relationships between the black - hole mass , @xmath0 , and the properties of the host galaxy bulge : velocity dispersion , @xmath10 , or bulge luminosity , @xmath17 .",
    "the measurements of the bulge properties are most useful for agns at low redshift ( @xmath20 ) where the host galaxy is easier to characterize .",
    "it is noteworthy that , even so , these methods can yield mass estimates that are currently quite uncertain , as explained below .",
    "based on single - epoch spectroscopy the scaling relationships are approximations to the virial - mass measurements obtained from reverberation mapping .",
    "the method relies on the radius ",
    "luminosity relationship , established by reverberation mapping . for a photoionized blr , its size @xmath21 should scale with the square root of the source luminosity , @xmath22 .",
    "kaspi ( 2000 ) found empirically that the size of the h@xmath5 emitting region scales with the continuum luminosity at 5100 to the power of 0.7 : @xmath21(h@xmath5 ) @xmath23(5100 ) . while this difference is yet to be understood",
    "( work is in progress ;   peterson & onken , this volume ) , this means that @xmath0 can be _ estimated _ when we have measurements of the continuum luminosity and the emission - line width : @xmath0 @xmath24 fwhm@xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "( note , the slope adopted in the literature is not uniform but ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 ) .",
    "the use of fwhm is a single - epoch approximation to the velocity dispersion of the line - emitting gas responding to continuum variations ( peterson & onken 2004 , this volume ) .",
    "vestergaard ( 2004b , this volume ) explains why these scaling relations are reasonable    three different broad emission lines ( h@xmath5 , mgii , and civ ) have been adopted along with continuum luminosities ( at 5100 , 3000 , and 1350 , respectively ) to estimate black - hole masses in large samples of quasars and agns [ h@xmath5 , civ : vestergaard ( 2002 ; 2004b , this volume ) ; mgii : mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) ; jarvis & mclure ( 2004 , this volume ) ] .",
    "there are pros and cons to each method as outlined next . using optical spectroscopy , the h@xmath5 method probes redshifts below 0.9 , mgii probes redshifts between 0.3 and 2.3 , while civ is accessible at redshifts between 1.2 and 4.9 .",
    "while feii emission heavily contaminates the mgii line profile (  francis 1991 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) and thus needs to be subtracted to allow measurements of fwhm(mgii ) , typically only strong feii emission affects the h@xmath5 line width .",
    "civ is only affected in the extreme wings by heii@xmath41640 , and occasionally by niv]@xmath41486 , and ( weak ) feii multiplets .",
    "however , the contribution to h@xmath5 from the narrow - line region needs to be subtracted .",
    "the only concern about civ is the possible presence of outflowing high - ionization blr gas , which may yield blue asymmetric broad profiles .",
    "this is seen very clearly in the case of narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies (  leighly 2000 ) for which the civ method is not well suited .",
    "but very few quasars appear to display such asymmetric profiles , so emitting outflows are probably not a general concern for quasars ( vestergaard 2004 ) .",
    "a notable assumption enters the mgii method , namely that mgii _",
    "should _ be emitted co - spatially with h@xmath5 and should therefore have similar line widths ( which seems to be the case ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "then fwhm(mgii ) can be used as a direct surrogate for h@xmath5 in the scaling relation .",
    "unfortunately , the only published data on mgii constrain the mgii lag ( or the distance from which it is emitted ) very poorly but the analysis by clavel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and dietrich & kollatschny ( 1995 ) suggest that mgii is not necessarily emitted co - spatially with h@xmath5 .",
    "the additional advantage of the available h@xmath5 and civ scaling relations is that they are calibrated to the more accurate reverberation mapping masses of nearby agns ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; kaspi 2000 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "the statistical scatter indicates 1@xmath27 uncertainties of factors 2.5 to 3 ( relative to the reverberation masses ) for these scaling relations .",
    "similar uncertainties are argued to be obtainable with mgii ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "nonetheless , individual mass estimates may be uncertain by as much as a factor 10 .",
    "the power of scaling relations is in their application to large statistical agn samples .",
    "the uncertainties of these scaling relations are dominated by the scatter in the @xmath28 relation , and improvements to this relation is thus desirable .",
    "also , there is a need to understand the outliers in the scaling relations ( table  2 ) .",
    "dramatically improving the accuracy of the reverberation masses , on which the scaling relations rely , will require a dedicated space - based observatory , such as the proposed midex mission _ kronos _",
    "(  peterson 2004 ) .    the radius @xmath21 can also be estimated with the reasonable assumption that the product of the ionization parameter and the electron density is roughly similar in all objects ( the photoionization method ) . in this case",
    "the mass estimate is a function of @xmath29fwhm@xmath25 and seems accurate to within a factor two of the reverberation masses ( wandel , peterson,&malkan1999 ) .      as the @xmath30 relation for quiescent galaxies is relatively tight and agns also fall on this relationship , good measurements of the bulge velocity dispersion in agn host galaxies can be used to estimate the black - hole mass ( and with a similar uncertainty ; table  2 ) .",
    "so far , only agns at @xmath31 have had @xmath10 measured because the caii@xmath4@xmath48498 , 8542 , 8662 absorption lines used for",
    "this measurement move into the atmospheric water vapor bands at @xmath32 ( ferrarese 2001 ) .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) suggested using fwhm([oiii ] ) as a proxy for @xmath10 since the near - nuclear stellar velocity dispersion correlates with fwhm([oiii ] ) for a sample of 75 seyfert galaxies ( nelson & whittle 1996 ) .",
    "boroson ( 2003 ) used data from the sdss early data release to assess and confirm that the 1@xmath27 uncertainty of this method is a factor of 5 . for this method to be more useful , both the scatter and the outliers need to be understood ( table  2 ) .",
    "some line asymmetries are suspected to be connected with outflows and can be prominent in radio sources where the narrow - line region and the radio source may interact .",
    "studies in the literature have used agn host galaxy imaging and the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies to measure the effective surface brightness , @xmath33 , and the effective radius , @xmath34 , to derive first @xmath10 and then @xmath0 .",
    "the reasoning is that especially nearby quasars and radio galaxies seem to reside in giant elliptical galaxies , which _ should _ fall on the fundamental plane .",
    "unfortunately , this method potentially has large uncertainties because ( a ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 are very hard to measure accurately in the presence of the bright nucleus of most agns , ( b ) the bulge / disk decomposition process is difficult even for nearby quiescent galaxies and is particularly challenging for agns , and ( c ) the method is subject to the uncertainties of both the fundamental plane and the @xmath0 @xmath6 relation . for radio galaxies , unaffected by nuclear glare , a factor 4 ( or larger ) uncertainty in estimating @xmath10 alone seems appropriate ( woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "the combined uncertainty of the fundamental plane      the black - hole mass of quiescent galaxies correlates , in addition to @xmath10 , with the bulge luminosity , @xmath17 , although with larger scatter . for this reason ,",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath35 relation is generally not preferred for mass estimates of normal galaxies .",
    "this method has also proven difficult and prone to significant uncertainties owing to the nuclear glare affecting the bulge / disk decomposition process (  wandel 2002 ) .",
    "nonetheless , mclure & dunlop ( 2001 , 2002 ) argue that with careful @xmath21-band measurements of the agn host galaxy , first @xmath17 and then @xmath0 can be estimated to within a factor 3 to 4 .",
    "unfortunately , this method has not yet been calibrated to reverberation mapping masses , but rather to mass estimates based on scaling laws .",
    "this may not be a severe problem since the authors find their agns to have the same slope and scatter as the inactive galaxies with dynamical mass measurements to within the errors .",
    "table  2 lists suggestions to how we may improve the mass estimation methods . in addition , it is important to understand their limitations as well as their efficacy . since reverberation masses provide the anchor of the scaling relations a few comments thereon are in order .",
    "an understanding of the blr structure and kinematics is required to determine the absolute zero - point of the reverberation masses ( the ` @xmath3 ' factor ) .",
    "this is a non - trivial but an achievable task with a dedicated observatory like _ kronos _ and existing advanced analysis techniques ( peterson 2004 ; peterson & horne 2004 ) .",
    "also , direct comparisons of stellar dynamics and reverberation mapping need to be effected .",
    "moreover , the odd objects need to be understood : for example , for 3c390.3 the lower ionization lines appear to have shorter lags , in contrast to other agns . as",
    "this object is the only broad - line radio source which has been monitored , it needs to be established whether or not it belongs to a separate class of objects . understanding this behavior is also    boroson , t.  a. 2003 , , 585 , 647 clavel , j. , et al .",
