    "the present paper concerns models for infectious diseases in a community of households , in which the response to disease varies between individuals ; we restrict our attention to having two different responses , denoted mild and severe .",
    "one common such situation is for example where there are asymptomatic cases showing no or hardly any symptoms but still contributing to the further spread of the disease .",
    "the reason why individuals show different symptoms may vary for different diseases . in the present paper we focus on two potential explanations .",
    "the first explanation is that the disease response is determined by individual characteristics , for example someone having partial immunity might become asymptomatic if infected ( e.g.  staalsoe and hviid ( 1998 ) for malaria and leroy _ et al . _  ( 2001 ) in the context of ebola ) .",
    "the second explanation we consider is where the response depends on the type of infectious contact and/or whom the individual was contacted by .",
    "examples where this seems to be the case are dengue fever ( mangada and igarashi 1998 ) , measles ( morley and aaby 1997 ) and varicella ( mehta and chatterjee 2010 ) .",
    "ball and becker ( 2006 ) consider the evaluation of vaccination strategies for a model in which infectious cases may be either mild or severe .",
    "however , their analysis is based on post - vaccination reproduction numbers rather than on mechanistic models such as those considered in this paper .",
    "the first explanation , where the response is determined by individual characteristics of the infected person , is suitably modelled using a multitype epidemic household ( mt - hh ) model ( ball and lyne 2001 ) . in the mt - hh model individuals",
    "are categorized into different types ; the type of an individual may affect susceptibility to the disease and also response , in particular infectivity , in the event when the individual becomes infected .",
    "quite often an individual s characteristics would not be known , which implies that the proportions of individuals of the different types in the community are unobserved .",
    "the second explanation can be modelled by extending the so - called infector - dependent - severity ( ids ) epidemic model of ball and britton ( 2007 ) to an infector - dependent - severity household ( ids - hh ) epidemic model . in the ids model ,",
    "the probability of an individual becoming a mild / severe case depends on the disease response of the person who caused that individual s infection . in the ids - hh model",
    "this may also depend on whether the contact causing the infection was a within- or between - household contact ; for example , within - household transmission might have a higher risk of leading to severe infection .",
    "once the final size distribution of the ids - hh epidemic model is obtained , together with known such results for the mt - hh model , it is possible to compare the two distributions .",
    "the motivation for the present paper lies in this comparison .",
    "in particular we pose ( and answer ) the following question : can final size data from an epidemic outbreak with varying disease response be used to discriminate between the two candidate explanations for why infection response varies ? except in a few degenerate cases , the answer to",
    "the question is yes .",
    "this is illustrated numerically by showing that , in the limit as the population size tends to infinity in an appropriate manner , a possible outcome for either of the model is ( usually ) inconsistent with the other model .",
    "this is done by generating `` data '' from the mt - hh ( ids - hh ) model and showing that the kullback - leibler divergence of the estimated outbreak probabilities from the `` data '' is much smaller when inference is based on the mt - hh ( ids - hh ) model than when it is based on the ids - hh ( mt - hh ) model .",
    "the final size outcome probabilities for the ids - hh epidemic are obtained by numerically solving a set of differential equations , and the final size outcome probabilities for the mt - hh model are obtained numerically by solving a set of balance equations .",
    "consequently , we have no analytical results `` proving '' that the two models are inconsistent  our arguments are instead based on numerical studies",
    ". we also consider data generated from finite populations and use a simulation study to demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate between the models using a pseudolikelihood approach .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec - mt - hh ]",
    "we define the mt - hh model and review final outcome results for that model . in section  [ sec - ids - hh ]",
    "we define the ids - hh model and derive an appropriate determinstic approximation to it . in section",
    "[ sec : fsproperties ] we compare and contrast the final size outcomes of the two models via simulation studies , which ( i ) confirm the applicability of the asymptotic results to finite populations , ( ii ) strongly suggest that , as proved by ball and lyne 2010 for the mt - hh model , the final outcome of the ids - hh model satisfies a central limit theorem and ( iii ) shed light on some interesting differences between the models . in section  [ sec : modeldisc ]",
    "we show numerically that inference from final outbreak data makes it possible to distinguish between the two models , using both infinite populations , as described in the previous paragraph , and also finite populations , where a pseudolikelihood approach ( cf .",
    "ball and lyne 2010 ) is applied to simulated data .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion in section  [ disc ] .",
    "the multitype household epidemic was first analysed in depth by ball and lyne ( 2001 ) , see also becker and hall ( 1996 ) and britton and becker ( 2000 ) .",
    "we now describe this model using slightly different notation . with the present application in mind , we restrict the model to two types and exponentially distributed infectious periods .",
    "each individual is categorized as being a mild or a severe type , with the interpretation that if infected , the individual will become this type of infective .",
    "additional to this , individuals reside in households .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the number of households having @xmath2 mild and @xmath3 severe individuals , let @xmath4 denote the number of households of size @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 denote the total number of households .",
    "further , let @xmath7 denote the total population size , which is assumed to be finite .",
    "our analysis is of the limiting situation in which the total number of households @xmath8 tends to infinity in such a way that @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 and the limiting mean household size @xmath12 is finite",
    ". it would rarely be the case that the type of an individual is known , so we assume that each individual is a mild case with probability @xmath13 ( and severe with probability @xmath14 ) , with the types of different individuals being mutually independent .",
    "it then follows that the number of mild cases in a household of size @xmath5 is binomially distributed .",
    "hence , in a large community , we have that @xmath15 , and this holds with equality in the limiting situation described above",
    ".    the disease spreads according to the following rules .",
    "initially , a small given number of individuals are infected ( from some external force ) and the remaining individuals are susceptible . during his / her infectious period",
    "a mild infectious individual has ( global ) infectious contacts with any given other mild individual at rate @xmath16 and with any given severe individual at rate @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , an infectious severe individual has ( global ) infectious contacts with any given mild individual at rate @xmath18 and with any given other severe individual at rate @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , an infectious mild individual has ( local ) infectious contact with any given other mild member of his / her household at rate @xmath20 and with any given severe mamber of his / her household at rate @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding rates for local infectious contacts of an infectious severe individual are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "an ` infectious contact ' is defined as a contact which results in infection if the other individual is susceptible  otherwise the contact has no effect .",
    "the infectious period of all individuals follow exponential distributions , with rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 for mild and severe infectives , respectively .",
    "all contact processes are governed by homogeneous poisson processes , having rates as above .",
    "further , all infectious periods and all contacts processes ( whether or not either or both of the indivdiduals involved are the same ) are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "we assume that infected individuals are able to infect other individuals as soon as they have become infected , i.e.  there is no latent period .",
    "once an inidividual s infectious period is over , he / she recovers and becomes immune to further infection .",
    "the absence of a latent period , though unrealistic for most , if not all , human diseases , has no consequence for our present purpose , since the distribution of the final outcome of the mt - hh model is not changed if an almost surely finite latent period is incorporated ( provided the rest of the model is the same ) .",
    "the mt - hh model has the following 11 parameters : @xmath26 .",
    "later we consider final size data for this model .",
    "in that situation we can , and hence do , assume without loss of generality that @xmath27 .",
    "( the final outcome of a closed - population stochastic sir epidemic of this type can be obtained by considering a random directed graph whose vertices are the individuals in the population and , for any vertices @xmath28 , there is a directed edge from @xmath29 to @xmath30 if and only if individual @xmath29 , if infected , has infectious contact with individual @xmath30 ; see , for example , pellis _ et al . _  ( 2008 ) .",
    "the set of people who are ultimately infected by the epidemic is given by the those individuals for which there is a chain of directed edges leading to them _ from _ an initial infective .",
    "thus if , for example , @xmath31 , we can divide all infection rates _ from _ mild infectives by @xmath24 and then set @xmath32 without changing the probability measure of the above random directed graph , and hence without changing the final outcome distribution . note that this directed random graph explains also the above comment concerning a latent period . ) it is also shown in ball _",
    "et al . _  ( 2004 ) that the 4 global infection parameters are not uniquely identifiable from final size data ",
    "what is identifiable are two separate linear combinations of these four parameters ( details are given at the end of section  [ sec : mtlargepop ] ) .",
    "in conclusion we hence have 7 parameters that are identifiable from final size data for the mt - hh model .",
    "the mt - hh model is closely related to the model analysed in ball and lyne ( 2001 ) .",
    "( the latter model allows for arbitrarily many types , non - random allocation of types of individuals to households and arbitrary but specified infectious period distributions . ) using essentially the same argument as in ball and lyne ( 2001 ) , the mt - hh model possesses a threshold parameter @xmath33 , a reproduction number for the proliferation of infected households , which determines whether or not an epidemic started with few initial infectives can become established in a large population .",
    "we now consider the final outcome of such an epidemic that becomes established ,",
    "so implicitly we assume that @xmath33 is above its threshold value of 1 . for @xmath10 and @xmath34",
    "such that @xmath35 , let @xmath36 denote the limiting fraction of households of size @xmath5 that have @xmath37 mild cases and @xmath38 severe cases at the end of an epidemic that becomes established , where the limit is as the total number of households @xmath39 .",
    "an outline derivation of a method for determining @xmath40 is given below .",
    "it is a slight adaptation of the argument used in ball and lyne ( 2001 ) , which should be consulted for further details .",
    "it is fruitful to consider first the following two - type single - household epidemic model proposed by addy _",
    "_  ( 1991 ) .",
    "suppose that the household is of size @xmath5 , that it contains @xmath2 mild individuals and @xmath41 severe individuals , and that all @xmath5 individuals are initially susceptible .",
    "during the course of the epidemic , individuals avoid infection from outside of the household independently , with probabilities @xmath42 and @xmath43 for mild and severe individuals , respectively .",
    "the local spread within the household is governed by the same disease dynamics as in the mt - hh model .",
    "write @xmath44 , \\quad { \\boldsymbol{\\pi}}= ( \\pi_m,\\pi_s)\\ ] ] and denote this single - household epidemic model by @xmath45 .",
    "( recall that we assume that @xmath27 . )",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote respectively the numbers of mild and severe removed cases in the household at the end of the single - household epidemic , let @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the probabilities @xmath53 may be determined using the following triangular system of linear equations ( see addy _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 , equation  ( 4 ) ) ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 the means @xmath57 and @xmath58 are easily computed once the probabilities + @xmath53 have been obtained .",
    "returning to the mt - hh model , suppose that there are few initial infectives , and let @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote respectively the proportions of individuals that are ultimately mild removed and severe removed , respectively .",
    "then , if the total population size @xmath61 is large , the probability that a given mild susceptible avoids _ global _ infection throughout the course of the epidemic is approximately @xmath62 = \\exp [ -(z_m \\lambda_{mm}^{(g ) }   + z_s \\lambda_{sm}^{(g ) }   ) ] $ ] .",
    "the corresponding probability for a given severe susceptible is @xmath63 $ ] . in the limit as the number of households @xmath39 , the approximate probabilities @xmath42 and @xmath43 become exact and whether or not distinct individuals avoid global infection become independent .",
    "it follows that , in the event of an epidemic becoming established , the final outcome within a typical household of size @xmath5 , that initially contained @xmath2 mild and @xmath41 severe susceptibles is distributed according to the final outcome of the single - household epidemic @xmath45 , with @xmath64 given by @xmath65 \\text{\\quad and\\quad } \\pi_s = \\exp [ -(z_m \\lambda_{ms}^{(g ) } + z_s \\lambda_{ss}^{(g)})].\\label{pimpis}\\ ] ] note that the expected final number of mild removal cases in a household chosen uniformly at random is given by @xmath66 .",
    "thus , by conditioning on first the size of and then the number of mild individuals in such a randomly chosen household , we have that @xmath67 a similar argument shows that @xmath68 after substituting for @xmath69 from ( [ pimpis ] ) , equations ( [ muhzm ] ) and ( [ muhzs ] ) give a pair of non - linear equations for @xmath70 .",
    "these equations always have the solution @xmath71 . if @xmath72 this is the only solution , whilst if @xmath73 there is ( subject to very mild conditions on the parameters ) a unique second solution in @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath75 say , giving the proportions of individuals that are ultimately mild and severe removed in the event of an epidemic that becomes established .",
    "it follows that , if @xmath76 is obtained by substituting @xmath77 in ( [ pimpis ] ) , then , for @xmath10 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 calculating these final size probabilities numerically is relatively straightforward and follows exactly this procedure .",
    "having substituted for @xmath69 from  , we first solve ( numerically ) the balance equations   and   to find @xmath80 , substitute this into   to find @xmath81 , then use   to calculate the final size distributions @xmath82 .",
    "note from   that any @xmath83 satisfying @xmath84 and @xmath85 yields the same final size probabilities @xmath82 , so only these two linear combinations of @xmath83 and not the individual global infection rates are identifiable from final size data .",
    "thus when fitting the mt - hh model we estimate @xmath86 rather than @xmath83 .",
    "the infector - dependent - severity household model is an epidemic model where infected individuals may , upon infection , become either severely infected or mildly infected , and the probability that an infected individual becomes mildly ( or severely ) infected may depend on both the type of its infector and whether the infectious contact is local or global .",
    "additionally , individuals reside in households and the transmission rate is typically appreciably higher between individuals sharing a household . the model is defined as follows .",
    "assume that there are @xmath61 individuals in total , and that each individual resides in a household .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the number of households of size @xmath5 and let @xmath88 denote the total number of households .",
    "we consider the limiting situation in which the population size tends to infinity in the same way as described in section  [ sec : mtdef ] .",
    "initially there are @xmath89 mild infectives and @xmath90 severe infectives , with the remaining individuals assumed to be susceptible .",
    "( the locations of the initial infectives is discussed later . )",
    "mild infectives recover and become immune at rate @xmath24 and severe infectives recover and become immune at rate @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the infectious periods of infectives are assumed to follow exponential random variables , with parameter depending on whether an infective is a mild or a severe case . while infectious , a mild infective makes global infectious contacts with any given individual at rate @xmath91 .",
    "if a contacted person is susceptible he / she becomes mildly infected with probability @xmath92 and severely infected with probability @xmath93 ; if a contacted person is already infected then the contact has no effect .",
    "additionally , a mild infective has contact with any ( other ) given household member ( local contact ) at rate @xmath94 , and such a contacted individual , if susceptible , becomes a mild infective with probability @xmath95 and severe infective with probability @xmath96 .",
    "severe infectives have contacts according to the same rules , although with parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "all contact processes and infectious periods are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "the epidemic continues until there is no ( mild or severe ) infective present , when the epidemic stops .",
    "the parameters of the ids - hh model are @xmath101 .",
    "note that rescaling time does not change the final outcome of an epidemic , so , without loss of generality , we may assume that e.g.  @xmath32 , whence there are 9 parameters that are , in principle , identifiable from final outcome data .",
    "note also that the directed random graph argument used for the final outcome of the mt - hh model fails to hold for the ids - hh model , since the distribution of edges emanating from any given individual depends on the type of that individual , which is not determined at the outset of the epidemic and indeed depends on the temporal behaviour of the epidemic .",
    "thus , fixing @xmath24 as well as @xmath25 would involve a loss of generality and the distribution of the final outcome of the ids - hh model is generally not invariant to a latent period .",
    "suppose that the epidemic starts at time @xmath102 and for @xmath103 , let @xmath104 denote the number of households of size @xmath5 that at time @xmath105 have @xmath29 mild infectives , @xmath30 severe infectives , @xmath2 mild removed individuals and @xmath106 severe removed individuals .",
    "assume now that there is a maximal household size @xmath107 , so @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath103 , let @xmath110 be the vector obtained by letting @xmath111 vary over all possible feasible values ; viz .",
    "then @xmath113 is a density - dependent markov population process which can be analysed using theory developed in ethier and kurtz ( 1986 , chapter  11 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath114 as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 satisfies @xmath117 , so a strictly positive fraction of the population is initially infected in the limit as @xmath39 .",
    "then the above - mentioned theory of ethier and kurtz ( 1986 ) shows that the ids - hh epidemic process scaled by @xmath8 , @xmath118 , converges in probability to a vector of deterministic functions defined by a set of differential equations .",
    "more precisely , the component @xmath119 converges to @xmath120 defined below .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath121 is hence the ( asymptotic ) fraction of the size-@xmath5 households that at time @xmath105 have @xmath29 mild infectives , @xmath30 severe infectives , @xmath2 mild removed individuals and @xmath106 severe removed individuals . using this notation we can define the ( asymptotic ) fraction mildly and severely infected at time @xmath105 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively , by @xmath124    the functions @xmath125 are defined by the following set of differential equations : @xmath126 with initial values given by @xmath127 .",
    "the differential equation   applies to all relevant @xmath128 , i.e.  where each of the indices are non - negative and @xmath129 .",
    "vector components ` out of bounds ' , e.g.  where some index is negative , are defined to be 0 , for example @xmath130 .",
    "the first four terms in   are for households entering the state @xmath128 , explaining why they have a plus sign .",
    "the first term is for a household presently in state @xmath131 having a mild infection and gives the overall rate for such an event to occur .",
    "the second term is for @xmath132-households having another severe infection , the third term is for @xmath133-households having a mild removal and the fourth term is for the severe removals .",
    "the remaining terms describe events that cause a household to leave the state @xmath128 .",
    "the fifth term is the overall rate at which susceptibles in a @xmath128-households become infected , either mildly or severely and the last term is the overall rate at which infectives ( mild and severe ) in @xmath128-households are removed .",
    "our goal is to obtain @xmath134 , the limiting fraction of households of size @xmath5 that have @xmath37 mild and @xmath38 severe cases at the end of the epidemic .",
    "if the numbers of initial mild and severe infectives , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are held fixed as @xmath39 , then , for large @xmath8 , the epidemic can become established only if the household reproduction number @xmath135 is strictly larger than one .",
    "( the reproduction number @xmath135 can be obtained by approximating the process of infected households by a two - type branching process , the type of an infected household being the type of its initial case ; we omit the details as @xmath135 is not required for the present paper . )",
    "ideally , we would like to be able to calculate @xmath134 for an epidemic that becomes established under these conditions .",
    "however , if @xmath89 and @xmath90 are held fixed , then @xmath136 and the theory of ethier and kurtz ( 1986 ) can not be applied directly .",
    "thus we assume instead that a very small , but strictly positive , fraction of individuals are initially infected and approximate @xmath134 , by solving the differential equations   numerically up to a time when the remaining fraction of infective individuals is negligible .",
    "more specifically , we assume that a fraction @xmath137 of the population is initially severely infective , with these infective individuals being chosen uniformly at random , so @xmath138 we stop the numerical integration at the first time @xmath139 when the proportion of the population that is infective , i.e.  @xmath140 , is less than @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the final size probabilities are then given by @xmath143 .",
    "however , note that the final size probabilities are essentially insensitive to the initial conditions , provided that the proportion of index cases is sufficiently small .    the theory of ethier and kurtz ( 1986 , chapter  11 ) can also be used to show that , in the limit as the number of households @xmath39 , the fluctuations of the stochastic model @xmath144 about its deterministic limit @xmath145 ( defined by @xmath146 ) , after being suitably scaled , converge to a zero - mean gaussian process , whose covariance function can , in principle , be determined . as in ball and britton ( 2007 , 2009 ) , this central limit theorem can be extended heuristically to hold also for the end of the epidemic , the time of which tends to infinity as @xmath39 , by making a random time scale transformation in which the clock runs at rate @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are respectively the total number of mild and severe infectives present at time @xmath105 in the untransformed process , cf .",
    "ethier and kurtz ( 1986 , pp .",
    "466467 ) .",
    "this yields a multivariate central limit theorem for the quantities @xmath150 ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) , where @xmath150 is the number of households of size @xmath5 which ultimately have @xmath37 mild removed and @xmath38 severe removed individuals . in principle , it is possible to compute the covariance matrix of the limiting normal distribution numerically , though in practice the required computations are prohibitive except for populations comprising only very small households . for a population with households of sizes @xmath154",
    ", determining the deterministic limit @xmath145 requires solving a system of @xmath155 differential equations and determining the above covariance matrix requires solving a system of @xmath156 differential equations . for @xmath157 , @xmath158 , so while it is perfectly feasible to solve for @xmath145 numerically , that may not be the case for the covariance matrix .",
    "to illustrate the asymptotic results given in the previous sections and explore some of the properties of the two models we have presented , we performed simulation studies of both models and compared some of their final size properties . in order to do this",
    "we first needed to select values for the parameters of our models .",
    "first we address these parameter choices in the mt - hh model . as mentioned in section  [ sec : mtdef ] , the removal rates can without loss of generality be set to unity : @xmath27 .",
    "the fraction of mild types in the community was set to @xmath159 .",
    "this value was chosen so that approximately one third of all infected are mild cases ( reported by carrat _",
    "et al . _  ( 2008 ) to be the case for asymptomatic cases regarding influenza ) .",
    "the global contact rates were chosen as @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , so severe infectives are more infectious and also mild infectives rarely globally infect mild susceptibles .",
    "the corresponding local contact rates were chosen as @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , so severe infectives are also more infectious locally and mild infectives have a relatively higher probability of infecting mild susceptibles when compared with global contacts .",
    "the absolute values of the two contact matrices were chosen so that approximately 50% of the population becomes infected , this being a realistic value for influenza ( see ferguson _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "the relative magnitude of the global and local contact rates was chosen so that both types of contact play a significant role in the spread of infection .",
    "the parameters of the ids - hh model were chosen to be @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath32 and @xmath176 .",
    "these parameter values were chosen for the same reasons as the parameters for the mt - hh model , with the addition that the infectious period was set to be shorter ( on average ) for severe cases than for mild cases , having in mind asymptomatic individuals who are less likely to ` self - quarrantine ' as they are unaware of their infection .",
    "the parameter common to both models is the distribution of household sizes . in this paper",
    "we consider two different population structures .",
    "the first is for the case where households of size 1 , 2 and 3 are equally likely and no larger households exist , i.e.  @xmath177 , and is chosen largely for computational convenience .",
    "the second population structure corresponds to the household structure of uk in 2003 ( found by typing ` household sizes ' into the search box at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/census2001.asp ) , with the simplification that households of size 5 and larger were truncated and all assumed to have size 5 ( only 2% of the households had larger household size than 5 , so this truncation should have negligible effect ) .",
    "the household structure for this case is given by @xmath178 .",
    "for future reference we denote these distributions by @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we also note that 3 is the minimum value of @xmath181 for both models to be , in principle , identifiable .    for both models we ran 10,000 simulations of systems with 10,000 households , the sizes being given by @xmath182 .",
    "( we treated @xmath183 as giving the proportions of households of different sizes , rather than having random household sizes with distribution @xmath183 . ) in order that minor outbreaks are unlikely , we initiated the epidemics with 10 infectives , each randomly chosen in different households of size 5 ; in the mt - hh model these individuals may be mild - type or severe - type ( with respective probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and in the ids - hh model we specified that they are all severe cases . for simulations that result in more than 0.15 of the population becoming infected",
    "we then recorded the overall final size amongst initial susceptibles and the within - household final sizes amongst households that are initially completely susceptible .",
    "( inspection of histograms ( not shown ) of the final proportion of individuals infected suggests that this cutoff is appropriate for separating minor and major outbreaks . )",
    "figures  [ fig : mtsimhist ] and  [ fig : idssimhist ] show histograms of the numbers of individuals ultimately mildly and severely infected in , respectively , the 9,992 simulations of the mt - hh model and the 9,993 simulations of the ids - hh model that resulted in major outbreaks . overlaid on these histograms are probability density functions ( scaled so as the area under them matches that of the histograms ) of normal distributions with the same mean and variance .",
    "the excellent agreement between the histograms and density functions in figure  [ fig : mtsimhist ] is expected in view of the central limit theorem for the mt - hh model of ball and lyne ( 2001 ) and in figure  [ fig : idssimhist ] this lends credence to the central limit theorem discussed in section  [ sec : idslargepop ] above for the final outcome of the ids - hh model .",
    "though the mean values of these distributions are similar ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ; @xmath186 , @xmath187 )  indeed the parameter values were chosen with this intention  it is interesting to note that the variability is rather different in the two models .",
    "the spread of the distribution of the number of mild cases in the ids - hh model is appreciably larger than that in the mt - hh model ( @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) and , though not to the same extent , the distribution of the number of severe cases is also slightly more spread in the ids - hh model ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) .",
    "part of the reason for this is that in the mt - hh model the types of individuals are determined in advance , but in the ids - hh model the types of the infected individuals depend on the evolution of the epidemic and some feedback may occur ( though with different parameters it might potentially be positive or negative ) .",
    "tables  [ tab : mtestepprop ] and  [ tab : idsestepprop ] give further information about the within - household outcomes of major outbreaks in the two models .",
    "these tables give , for each household size @xmath5 , estimates from the simulations of the probability that a typical individual in a household of size @xmath5 is ultimately ( i ) mildly infected ( @xmath192 ) , ( ii ) severely infected ( @xmath193 ) and ( iii ) infected ( @xmath194 ) , and also of the probability that a case in a household of size @xmath5 is severe ( @xmath195 . the figures in parentheses are the corresponding infinite population asymptotic quantities obtained from @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",

    "this a consequence of local spread being greater in larger households . in the mt - hh model",
    "the proportion of cases that are severe decreases with @xmath5 , whereas this proportion increases with @xmath5 in the ids - hh model . in the ids - hh model",
    "this simply reflects the fact that local infections are very likely to result in severe cases . in the mt - hh model",
    ", however , an individual s type is determined in advance rather than by the spread of infection and this results in a ` saturation effect ' of sorts .",
    "note that the proprtion of cases in households of size 1 that are severe ( 0.7191 ) is larger than the proportion of individuals that are of severe type ( 0.6 ) . in larger households more local spread",
    "is expected than in smaller households ( as @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 are independent of household size ) and the rates are such that severe types are more likely to be infected .",
    "indeed , in a very large household we would expect everyone to be infected , in which case the proportion of cases that are severe must be equal to the proportion of individuals of severe type .",
    "for any household size , the proportion of globally contacted individuals that are severe is 0.7191 . however , since local spread increases with households size and there is greater scope for local infection amongst mild types than severe types ( as relatively fewer are infected globally ) the proportion of cases that are severe must decrease with household size .",
    "clearly the above phenomena depend on the parameter values chosen in the two models .",
    "for example , in either model , simply interchanging the labels of the two types results in the opposite effect of household size on @xmath204 being observed .",
    "suppose data from a population with household structure given by @xmath205 are generated from one of the two models , with some given parameters @xmath206 or @xmath207 , as appropriate .",

    "disc ] , we describe our main findings concerning whether the mt - hh and ids - hh models can be distinguished on the basis of final size data . in section  [ sec : klmotivation ] we motivate our use of the kullback - leibler divergence as a tool for model fitting and discrimination and finally , in section  [ sec : ident ] , we discuss identifiability issues that arise in fitting the models to final outcome data .      final size data for an infinite population are generated using the methods described in the previous sections . for the mt - hh model",
    "we solve equations ( 2.1)(2.4 ) numerically and for the ids - hh model we solve the differential equations   numerically , as described in sections  [ sec : mtlargepop ] and  [ sec : idslargepop ] , respectively . to generate final size data for finite populations",
    "we simulate an outcome of the relevant stochastic process according to the model description in section  [ sec : mtdef ] or  [ sec : idsdef ] , as appropriate , ( with 10 initial severe infectives , each in separate households of size @xmath181 , to increase the chance of a major outbreak occuring ) . if a major outbreak does occur ( which we take to be more than 0.15 of the population becoming infected ) then we calculate the empirical final size distribution considering only the households in that simulation that had no initial infectives . in either case",
    "we denote by @xmath211 the ` target ' household final size distributions that we try to reproduce from the model we choose to fit to the data .",
    "we now describe the algorithm we use to fit each model to given final size data @xmath212 .",
    "the goal is to find parameters @xmath213 of the model we are fitting so that the distance between the final size distributions @xmath214 , corresponding to @xmath206 or @xmath207 , and the ` target ' final size distributions @xmath212 is as small as possible .",
    "we measure this distance using the kullback - leibler ( k - l ) divergence @xmath215 the use of the k - l divergence is motivated by its well - known relationship with likelihood - based inferential procedures ( see , for example , bishop _",
    "et al . _",
    "( 1975 , pp .",
    "344348 ) ) , which is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : klmotivation ] .",
    "we minimise @xmath216 numerically using matlab s fmincon constrained optimisation routine .",
    "this requires selecting a starting point @xmath217 for the parameters ; we choose these starting values independently at random , the rate parameters from an exponential distribution with mean 1 and proportion / probability parameters uniformly from the interval @xmath218 . in the case of fitting the ids - hh model",
    "we find that the numerical optimisation is more difficult and that it is beneficial to sample several ( we use 20 ) such possible starting points @xmath217 and then start the numerical optimisation routine at the best of these points ( i.e.  that with smallest @xmath219 ) , so that the numerical routine is more likely to start at a point in parameter space that is at least moderately compatible with the target final size distributions @xmath209 .",
    "we describe this process of choosing a starting point for and then running the optimisation routine as a single ` run ' of our algorithm ( i.e.  model fitting procedure ) .",
    "calculating @xmath220 using the methods described in section  [ sec : mtlargepop ] or  [ sec : idslargepop ] is straightforward and in principle evaluating @xmath216 is then trivial as long as @xmath221 has no zero entries , i.e.  as long as the parameter vector @xmath213 results in the model being super - critical .",
    "however , there are numerical problems that can arise when calculating the k - l divergence as in equation  .",
    "these problems arise due to so - called ` catastrophic cancellation ' which occurs when using the formula   if @xmath209 and @xmath221 differ only slightly .",
    "the terms @xmath222 are all small ( since @xmath221 and @xmath209 are close ) but are of differing signs ( since sometimes @xmath223 and sometimes vice - versa ) , thus when the sum @xmath224 is close to zero there can be catastrophic cancellation and the calculated sum can be wildly inaccurate .",
    "we resolve this by using the taylor series approximation @xmath225 about @xmath226 ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "( 1975 , lemma  14.9 - 1 ) ) , which implies @xmath227 this approximation becomes exact as @xmath228 so using it when the calculated k - l distance is small gives a good approximation and avoids numerical problems .",
    "numerical experiments comparing the calculated values of @xmath216 using   and   show good agreement , improving as @xmath216 becomes smaller ( precisely as expected ) , but when @xmath216 is less than about @xmath229 we begin to see significant disagreement .",
    "therefore , all our calculations of k - l distance initially use   but if the result is smaller than @xmath230 we recalculate using  .",
    "the random starting values of @xmath206 and @xmath207 in our fitting procedure will sometimes be poor ( i.e.  give large values of @xmath216 ) and result in the optimisation routine staying in a part of parameter space that gives a very poor fit .",
    "thus , when fitting a model to data we run our algorithm many times over to ensure that as much as possible of the parameter spaces are explored .",
    "the number of these runs necessary is somewhat variable ; this issue is addressed in section  [ sec : ident ] .",
    "initially we focus simply on the smallest of the k - l distances @xmath231 of the model from the data that we find for each combination of dataset and model . in section  [ sec : ident ] we explore in more detail the variability of the @xmath231 from run to run of our algorithm and also examine the behaviour of the corresponding parameter estimates @xmath232 .        to determine whether or not each model is capable of producing the final size distributions generated by the other model we fit a given final size distribution to both models , in the expectation that the correct model will fit appreciably better .",
    "we find that the correct model can be made to fit as well as we please by tightening the stopping criteria of the numerical optimisation routine but that there is a definite non - zero lower bound for @xmath231 when we fit the wrong model .",

    "we investigate how our model fitting methodology works in practice .",
    "we find that there are two key issues that influence the overall behaviour of our algorithm .",

    "the target final size distribution can not be captured exactly when either ( i ) we try to fit the wrong model or ( ii ) the data is from a finite population .",
    "( this has the important consequence that when fitting a model to empirical final size distributions we need only run the algorithm a few , say 510 , times to be confident that we have found the best possible fit . )",
    "we therefore restrict our attention here to an exploration of seeking to fit the models to ` data ' which are the asymptotic ( @xmath210 ) distributions corresponding to the parameter values given earlier , with household size distribution @xmath179 .",
    "we refer to these data with this household size distribution and the parameters given previously as @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "in the course of this we clearly see the second issue that arises , namely that there are identifiability issues in the ids - hh model . in the ids - hh model",
    "as we parameterise it , it seems that some parameters are identifiable while some are more difficult to identify , though we can find functions of these parameters which do appear to be identifiable .",
    "firstly we look at fitting each model to data generated from that same model , so we should be able to recover the input parameters used to generate the data and find that @xmath231 is very close to 0 .",

    "we mention in section  [ sec - mt - hh ] that it is known that in the mt - hh model the global rate parameters are not uniquely identifiable from final size data ( ball _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) and for this reason we estimate the probabilities @xmath69 rather than the global rates @xmath83 .",

    "careful examination of the parameter estimates when fitting the ids - hh model to @xmath279 suggests that some identifiability issues are present here .",

    "nevertheless , when the initial guess for @xmath25 is close to its optimum ( correct ) value , @xmath282 and the above linear combination of @xmath284 and @xmath285 are also estimated easily and reasonably accurately , and a very good fit is obtained . in the latter situation",
    "it is also possible to recover the individual rates @xmath284 and @xmath285 with our algorithm but this is far more difficult . that @xmath290 is estimated well is demonstrated in table  [ tab : idsfittoidsinfdata2 ] , in which @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by their observed values in the ( infinite ) data .",
    "the other parameters with identifiability issues are the global infection probabilities @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "some information about these parameters can be obtained by considering households of size 1 which become infected .",
    "focus on such a household and suppose that there are in total @xmath293 mild and @xmath294 severe infectives in the population just prior to its infection .",
    "then the probability that this infection is mild is @xmath295 now , @xmath293 and @xmath294 are random and vary throughout the epidemic .",
    "a crude approximation is to replace the ratio @xmath296 by @xmath297 , the latter taking into account the different infectious periods of mild and severe infectives .",
    "thus the proportion of infected households of size 1 that are mildly infected is approximately @xmath298 leading to the relationship @xmath299 we have seen above that the denominator in the right hand side of   can be estimated well , hence it is reasonable to expect that the numerator might be too . that this is indeed the case",
    "is borne out in table  [ tab : idsfittoidsinfdata2 ] .",
    "@xmath300    [ tab : idsfittoidsinfdata2 ]      we now turn our attention to the situation where we try to fit one of the models to final size data arising from the other model .",
    "fitting the mt - hh model to ids - hh data gives parameter estimates summarised in table  [ tab : mtfittoidsinfdata ] .",
    "while there is more variation in the mt - hh parameter estimates than when we fit to data from the mt - hh model , the variation is still relatively small .",
    "furthermore , the variation in the final k - l distances @xmath231 is very small ( mean @xmath301 , st .",
    "@xmath302 ) , giving confidence that ( i ) we have found the region of parameter space where the mt - hh model can best reproduce the data from the ids - hh model and ( ii ) that the best fitting mt - hh model does not reproduce the ids - hh final size distribution very well . for comparison",
    "the minimum of these k - l distances is also shown in figure  [ fig : exactfithist ] , as a point rather than a density because the variation is so small .",
    "@xmath303    [ tab : mtfittoidsinfdata ]",
    "lastly we consider fitting the ids - hh model to the mt - hh data ; see table  [ tab : idsfittomtinfdata ] and figure  [ fig : exactfithist ] . here",
    "we see variations in @xmath232 roughly the same as those seen when fitting the ids - hh model to data it can reproduce exactly .",
    "again we find that the estimates of @xmath304 and the @xmath305 s show little variation and we also see the same identifiability issues present .",
    "although the estimates of @xmath25 , @xmath282 , @xmath285 and the @xmath306 s individually vary wildly we find that @xmath283 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 show very little variation ( see table  [ tab : idsfittomtinfdata2 ] ) .",
    "similarly to when we fit the mt - hh model to the ids - hh data , we find very little variability in the final k - l distances that we find , for the 90 smallest values the mean and st .",
    "are @xmath309 and @xmath310 , respectively . though these k - l distances certainly seem bounded away from zero , suggesting that the ids - hh model can not reproduce the mt - hh final size distribution , they are appreciably smaller than when fitting the mt - hh model to ids - hh data .    @xmath311    [ tab : idsfittomtinfdata ]    @xmath312    [ tab : idsfittomtinfdata2 ]",
    "in this paper we define two candidate models that might explain how an infectious disease having varying disease response could spread in a community of households .",
    "large population properties of the two models are presented .",
    "these results are used to show by means of numerical illustrations , that it is generally possible to discriminate between the two models .",
    "more precisely , given final outcome data from a sufficiently large community of households it is , except in some degenerate cases , possible to determine which of the two explanations to varying disease response that best explain the data .",
    "both models could of course be extended towards higher realism .",
    "for example , besides household structure , all individuals are assumed similar whereas it would be more realistic to distinguish between adults and children having different mixing rates .",
    "another extension would be to allow for more than two different disease responses .",
    "it is of course also possible to come up with other models giving rise to mild and severe infectives .",
    "however , we believe that the two models studied capture the perhaps two most likely reasons : either the infection status of an individual is predetermined or else it depends on whom the person was infected by . in the first situation it could be natural to extend the model to allow this predetermined status to be dependent between individuals of the same household , for example due to previous exposure to the disease . in the present model it is assumed that the predetermined infection status is independent also within households .",
    "another important extension would of course be to apply the method to real data with the hope to find out more about the underlying reason for having varying disease response .",
