    "momentum correlations between pions have been widely used to study the space - time extent of the emitting source in nucleus - nucleus collisions . for identical bosons",
    "the symmetry requirement of bose ",
    "einstein ( be ) statistics results in an enhanced production of bosons with small momentum difference .",
    "this effect was first observed by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee and pais ( gglp ) @xcite for pairs of like - charge pions at small opening angles .",
    "kopylov and podgoretsky @xcite noticed the deep analogy with hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) space time correlations @xcite of the classical electromagnetic fields used in astronomy for interferometric measurement of star angular radii and developed the basic methods of momentum interferometry in particle and nuclear collisions .",
    "this technique represents an important tool for investigating the underlying reaction mechanism as far as it influences the decoupling configuration . for example , an unusually long decoupling time was suggested as one of the signatures of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present data from an experimental study of be correlations between charged kaons emitted in central collisions of pb nuclei at a beam energy of 158 a@xmath0gev with a fixed pb target .",
    "we compare the results with those from earlier analyses of pion data for the same reaction .",
    "it was argued @xcite that correlations of kaons and pions might differ due to different contributions from resonance decays during their propagation toward freeze - out . a comparison could help to distinguish between a qgp deflagration and a conventional production mechanism based on independent nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "however , rescattering between the final hadrons may smear out the differences and obscure what happened in the earlier stages of the collision .",
    "= 14 cm    a probably more important aspect of kaons is associated with their higher mass .",
    "the particle source resulting from a collision between heavy nuclei is rapidly expanding in longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "this manifests itself in a dependence of the extracted correlation parameters on the transverse mass @xmath1 of the particles , which form the pair @xcite .",
    "therefore , kaons and pions probe the situation in different kinematic regimes .",
    "assuming that the decoupling surface coincides for both particle species , the kaons extend the @xmath1 range of the pion data and improve the sensitivity of comparisons with reaction models .    because of their much smaller abundance a study of kaon correlations requires higher event numbers and a significantly improved particle identification compared to the pion case .",
    "the only published results on kaon correlation in pb+pb collisions were obtained by experiment na44 at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "the na49 spectrometer @xcite includes a high - resolution time - of - flight ( tof ) detector with acceptance at mid - rapidity which allows to select a relatively clean kaon sample .",
    "data obtained from an analysis of approximately 1.7 million central as well as from 2 million semi - central events will be shown .",
    "the k@xmath27k@xmath27 and k@xmath28k@xmath28 correlation functions are obtained in terms of the bertsch - pratt ( bp ) @xcite and yano - koonin - podgoretsky ( ykp ) @xcite coordinate frames .",
    "they are corrected for coulomb effects .",
    "the extracted parameters - correlation radii , freeze - out duration - will be compared with those obtained for pions @xcite in the same central rapidity range .",
    "the 158 a@xmath0gev pb ions from the cern sps were measured in position and direction by beam position detectors before hitting a pb foil target of 224(336 ) mg/@xmath29 thickness ( 1(2.5 ) % interaction probability ) during the 1995/1996(2000 ) data taking periods .",
    "the trigger condition was derived from the signal detected in the veto calorimeter ( vcal , see fig .  [ figure1 ] ) which intercepts mainly projectile spectators 25 m downstream of the target . for the central data sample",
    "the 5% most central interactions were selected . in a geometrical picture",
    "this corresponds to impact parameters smaller than 3.5 fm .",
    "data taken during different run periods contribute 380 000 ( 1995 ) , 400 000 events ( 1996 ) and 911 000 events ( 2000 ) . from the year 2000",
    "run an additional sample corresponding to semi - central events ( centrality 5% - 20% ) was available and analysed .",
    "= 14 cm    the na49 spectrometer ( described in detail in @xcite ) consists of two superconducting magnets ( total bending power of 7.5 tm ) with tpcs ( time projection chambers ) inside the magnetic field , two additional tpcs downstream of the magnets , and several tof ( time - of - flight ) walls on both sides of the beam ( fig .  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the momentum vectors of charged particles are determined from their trajectories as measured in the tpcs and the position of the interaction point .",
    "the accuracy of the four - momentum difference ] @xmath30 of a particle pair is of the order of 3.5 mev in the momentum range of interest .    for particle identification a combination of the specific energy loss @xmath31 measured in the tpcs mtpc - r / l with the mass information obtained from the tof walls tof - r1/l1",
    "the method is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figure2]a for a typical momentum range . from fig .",
    "[ figure2]a it is clear that no satisfactory kaon identification can be derived from either the specific ionization or the tof signal alone .",
    "therefore we restrict the phase space used in the present study to the acceptance of the tof walls .",
    "particles inside the region around the kaon peak ( see fig .  [",
    "figure2]a ) are selected as kaons . the corresponding population in the rapidity ( @xmath32 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath33 ) plane",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure2]b for the k@xmath27 mesons ; for k@xmath28 it is nearly identical . from fits of sums of gaussian distributions for the different particle species the purity of the kaon sample",

    "the distribution of the average transverse mass , where @xmath34 is the average transverse momentum of the kaons in the pair . ] @xmath1 of accepted k@xmath27k@xmath27 pairs is shown in fig .  [ figure2]c . due to statistical limitations",
    "a subdivision into @xmath34 intervals was not possible . because of slightly different detector efficiencies the weighted means of the correlation functions obtained from the 1995 , the 1996 data and the 2000 data were used for the be correlation analysis .",
    "details of the analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath35 is defined as the ratio of the probability of observing particles with four - momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 simultaneously in one event divided by the probability for pairs of independent particles with the same single- particle phase space distribution .",
    "experimentally , the raw correlation function is obtained as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the yield of particle pairs from the same event with the four - momentum difference @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the uncorrelated reference generated by the event - mixing method and the factor @xmath42 is used to normalize the correlation function to be unity at large relative momenta ( 200 - 2000 mev ) .",
    "assuming an expanding gaussian source in a representation given by yano - koonin - podgoretsky @xcite and heinz @xcite that is appropriate to explicitly take into account collective expansion , the correlation due to quantum statistics can be parameterized in terms of the components of @xmath30 : @xmath43 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the transverse momentum difference , @xmath45 is the longitudinal momentum difference , @xmath46 is the energy difference , @xmath47 is the correlation intensity parameter and @xmath48 is the `` yano - koonin velocity '' which describes the source s longitudinal collective motion in the given rapidity range .",
    "the radii @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denote the transverse , longitudinal and temporal extent of the coherence lengths , respectively .",
    "although the ykp parameters have the most straightforward physical interpretation @xcite , this parameterization can be ill - defined in some kinematic regions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the bertsch - pratt parameterization in addition . for cylindrically",
    "symmetric systems and the midrapidity range it reads with vanishing cross terms @xcite : @xmath51 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is identical with @xmath53 defined above , and ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) are the components of the transverse 3-momentum difference in outward direction and perpendicular to it . as reference frame",
    ", a pairwise defined co - moving system would be appropriate . in view of the limited rapidity range considered here",
    "it is approximated by the so - called fixed local center - of - mass system , thus having the same frame for all particle pairs .",
    "projections of the raw correlation function of @xmath56 and @xmath57 pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] in bp - variables .    in order to extract the quantum - statistical effects , the counter - acting influence of the coulomb repulsion as well as the dilution by misidentified pairs must be taken into account , while the effect of the strong interaction can be neglected @xcite .",
    "this leads to the ansatz : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the purity of the pairs , @xmath60 represents the coulomb repulsion factor and @xmath61 is the correlation from quantum statistics parameterized by eqs .",
    "[ ykp ] or [ bp ] . because of the considerable size of the source in the present reaction @xcite the classical gamov correction factor is not appropriate @xcite . for pions",
    "the coulomb correction can be approximately determined from the experimental correlation function for unlike - sign pairs @xcite , which is dominated by the coulomb interaction and receives no contribution from be correlation .",
    "in contrast , the strong interaction can not be neglected @xcite for unlike - sign kaons .",
    "therefore , a parameterization of the coulomb repulsion factor derived from a finite - size source coulomb wave calculation @xcite is used for the present analysis : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the average distance between the emission points of the kaons in the pair center - of - mass system . following @xcite",
    "the value of @xmath63 can be calculated from the correlation radii @xmath49 in eqs .",
    "[ ykp ] and [ bp ] . as a consistency check",
    "the analogous procedure is applied below to the @xmath64 correlations which are also measured in this experiment .",
    "the determination of the radius parameters @xmath49 proceeds in an iterative way . starting with estimated values for @xmath49 , the coulomb repulsion factor @xmath60 ( eq .  [ coul ] )",
    "is calculated and smeared with the measuring resolution of @xmath30 .",
    "a set of @xmath49 and @xmath47 are then obtained from a 3-dimensional maximum likelihood fit of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ fitfunc ] to the raw correlation function eq .",
    "[ c2_define ] .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the fit parameters reach stable values .    for the central collisions",
    "the final results for the ykp and bp parameterizations are summarized in table [ tab_result ] with the fit quality given by @xmath65 .",
    "the quoted errors are only statistical .",
    "the systematic errors on the the fitted parameters due to uncertainty in coulomb correction and strong interaction are estimated to be about 10% of each parameter .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "from tables [ tab_result ] and [ tab_result2 ] one observes that the radius parameters for k@xmath27 and k@xmath28 are similar with a trend to somewhat larger values for k@xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected influence of coulomb interaction with the positive charge of the reaction zone @xcite .",
    "the correlation intensity parameter @xmath47 stays below unity .",
    "possible causes are e.g. a partially coherent source , a contribution to the observed kaons from decays of long - lived resonances , or a deviation from the gaussian parameterization due to a mixture of sources with different radii @xcite . the longitudinal source velocities @xmath48 are close to zero in agreement with the fact that our acceptance is restricted to midrapidity ( see fig .  [",
    "figure2]b ) .    when comparing the radius parameters obtained from kaon correlations with those of pions one has to bear in mind that these parameters depend on the transverse momentum or transverse mass as a consequence of the collective expansion of the source @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ figure6 ] we show the earlier pion data @xcite for the same reaction together with the kaon results from table [ tab_result ] as well as those from the cern experiment na44 @xcite . the radii show @xmath66 dependence with @xmath67 for the longitudinal radii ( as suggested by makhlin and sinyukov @xcite ) and @xmath68 for the transverse radii .    according to the relation : @xmath69 based on a hydrodynamic expansion model @xcite , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the freeze - out time and temperature of the particles , respectively , the longitudinal radii can be plotted as a function of @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ figure7]a ) using the known freeze - out temperature @xmath73 mev from @xcite . from its gradient the freeze - out time is extracted as @xmath74 fm , which is consistent with the previous estimate based on the pion correlation study in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relatively weak dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath1 can also be reproduced by hydrodynamic expansion models @xcite with a transverse expansion velocity @xmath76 around 0.55 ( see fig .  [ figure7]b ) .    in conclusion",
    "the kaon radius parameters are fully consistent with the published pion results and the hydrodynamic expansion model .",
    "the influence of different contributions of resonance formation and different rescattering cross sections seem to be either minor or similar in both cases .",
    "pions and kaons thus seem to decouple simultaneously .",
