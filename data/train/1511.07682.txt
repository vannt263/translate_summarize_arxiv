    "thermodynamic properties of the degenerate fermi liquid are determined by quasiparticles near the fermi surface whose dispersion law is of the same form as that of free particles , but with the effective mass depending on thermodynamic quantities @xcite . in the fermi - liquid approach",
    "the effective mass is expressed through a phenomenological amplitude that describes the interaction between quasiparticles . on microscopic level",
    "the effective mass was calculated for a weakly nonideal fermi gas @xcite .",
    "but such calculations are true only for low - density systems , on the assumption of validity of the born approximation , when the interaction between particles can be characterized by the only parameter  the scattering length that can be either positive or negative , as in the case of @xmath0he atoms .    in a more realistic description by means of model potentials ,",
    "one should take into account that the interaction between particles at short distances has the strong repulsive character and at long distances  the attractive character .",
    "therefore , in sufficiently dense mediums the characteristics of a system depend substantially on a concrete form of the interaction potential between particles and its parameters , as well as on the density . at low particle number density ,",
    "when the average distance between particles is comparable to or exceeds the characteristic range of action of the potential , it is the long - range component of the interparticle potential that plays a considerable role .",
    "with increasing the density and decreasing the average distance between particles , the effects of the strong repulsion between particles manifest themselves more and more . in a simplified description of the interaction by means of the only parameter , the scattering length ,",
    "the effects connected with the contributions of the long - range attraction and the short - range repulsion can not naturally be taken into account .",
    "note also that the born approximation is not valid , as a rule , for the realistic potentials with repulsion at short distances .",
    "it is known that accounting for the strong repulsion ( the hard core ) at short distances leads to considerable difficulties in calculations within the self - consistent field model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the contribution of the short - range forces into a system s energy appears to be considerably overestimated . in order to bypass this difficulty , in this paper it is proposed to use the effective interaction potential between particles differing from the interaction potential between free particles , as it is adopted in calculations by the self - consistent field method in nuclear physics @xcite . at that the `` hard '' core is replaced by the `` soft '' one ,",
    "the value of which is an adjustable parameter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the effective mass and to derive the equation of state of the fermi system in the microscopic approach within a variant of the self - consistent field model that was formulated in papers @xcite , by means of the interaction potentials accounting for both the repulsion and attraction between particles .",
    "a general formula is derived for the quasiparticle effective mass in the fermi system .",
    "the influence of the short - range repulsive forces and the long - range forces of interparticle attraction on the magnitude of the effective mass and the equation of state is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the repulsive forces promote a decrease of the effective mass , and the attractive forces promote its increase .",
    "specific calculations of the effective mass and the equation of state are carried out at zero temperature with the use of the modified morse potential . with a certain choice of the potential parameters",
    ", the dependence of the total pressure on the density appears to be nonmonotonic and the equation of state describes the coexistence of the gaseous and liquid phases . with increasing the density the calculated effective mass of quasiparticles decreases , which does not agree with experimental data on the liquid @xmath0he .",

    "the role of three - body interactions is considered and it is shown that accounting for three - body attractive forces promotes an increase of the effective mass .",

    "we assume @xmath12 . in the formula ( [ eq01 ] )",
    "the self - consistent potential @xmath13 has the meaning of the mean field acting on a single particle @xcite . in the absence of an external field in the spatially uniform case",
    "the state of a single particle can be characterized by its momentum @xmath14 , and its wave function has the form of a plane wave : @xmath15 under these conditions and neglecting the magnetic effects , the self - consistent potential has the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 the form of the potentials @xmath18 , conditioned by the direct and exchange interactions , is given below . in the spatially uniform case from ( [ eq01 ] )",
    "it follows the expression for the quasiparticle energy @xmath19 at low but finite temperatures , we define the fermi wave number for the degenerate system by the relation @xmath20 this relation establishes the connection between the chemical potential and the fermi wave number . with the help of the formula ( [ eq05 ] ) , eliminating the chemical potential from ( [ eq04 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath21 near the fermi surface @xmath22 , and the effective mass is defined by the relation @xmath23 .",
    "it can be represented in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 is the first order spherical bessel function . in this form",
    "the formula for the effective mass is true at finite temperature and for an arbitrary character of the interparticle interaction , and applicable for both the pair and many - body forces .",
    "note that the definition of the effective mass can be given in somewhat different way , namely @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xcite , but it leads to the same result ( [ eq07 ] ) .",
    "the total pressure in the fermi system with the pair interaction in the self - consistent field model is determined by a sum of two contributions @xmath29 : the positive pressure of a gas of quasiparticles with the effective mass @xmath30 and the pressure conditioned by the pair interparticle interaction , which can have both positive and negative sign : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the particle number density , @xmath33 .",
    "since the pair correlation function @xmath34 is everywhere positive , then the short - range positive part of the potential gives a positive contribution to the pressure , and the long - range part gives a negative contribution .",
    "potential energy of a system of @xmath35 particles possessing an internal structure can be represented as a sum of pair , three - body , etc .",
    "interactions @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a symmetric in all permutations of its coordinates function .",
    "the self - consistent field theory with account of contribution from three - body interactions is considered in paper @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the question of choosing the potentials of interparticle interactions .",
    "we begin with the analysis of the pair potentials .",
    "model potentials are often used to describe the interparticle interaction , which in the simplest case depend only on the distance between particles .",
    "an example of such potentials is given by the frequently used lennard - jones potential @xmath39 , % } % \\end{array}\\ ] ] containing two parameters : the distance @xmath8 and the energy @xmath40 .",
    "this potential rapidly tends to infinity at small distances .",
    "it turns into zero at @xmath41 , becoming negative at @xmath42 .",
    "the potential ( [ eq12 ] ) and similar ones can be written in the general form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the short - range part of the potential for which it is in many cases assumed @xmath45 at @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the long - range part of the potential such that @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "the use of the potentials with the hard core in quantum mechanical calculations , as it is known @xcite , leads to considerable difficulties .",
    "the potentials with the infinite core do not have the fourier image and the self - consistent field becomes infinite when using such potentials .",
    "sometimes , this fact is used as an argument to justify non - applicability of the self - consistent field model in one or another case , for example for describing the liquid @xcite .",
    "the use of the potential which rapidly tends to infinity at small distances means that an atom or other compound particle retains its identity at arbitrary high pressures .",
    "meanwhile , it is evident that the critical pressure must exist at which atoms approach each other so closely that they will be `` crushed '' and loose their identity .",
    "therefore , the requirement of absolute impermeability of particles at arbitrary high pressures is excessively rigorous and unphysical and , in our opinion , it is more reasonable to use the potentials which tend to a finite value at small distances .",
    "an example of such potential is the known morse potential @xmath50 - 2\\exp[-(r - r_0)/a]\\big\\ } , } % \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the energy parameter and @xmath51 are specific distances .",
    "it should also be noted that quantum chemical calculations lead to the potentials having a finite value of energy at zero @xcite .",
    "this energy proves to be rather large .",
    "thus , for the helium - helium potential it is of the order of @xmath52k .    but even at a finite but large energy , the role of the effects conditioned by the hard core appears to be considerably overestimated .",
    "it is associated with the fact that if , as it usually happens , a wave function with a slowly varying in space modulus is used for describing a quasiparticle state then the hard core gives an essentially overestimated contribution to the energy and other system characteristics , to which attention was long ago called by jastrow @xcite .",
    "indeed , the presence of the hard core does not allow particles to approach each other to distances less than its radius so that a real wave function , as distinct from a plane wave for example , must decrease rapidly at such distances . in order to remove the noted shortcoming ,",
    "jastrow @xcite suggested a wave function that takes into account this circumstance , though it appeared quite hard to use such function in calculations .",
    "one can try to correct the situation in another way , namely , having retained the description of quasiparticles by means of plane waves , to reject the use of the `` realistic '' potentials by means of which free particles interact . instead of the `` hard '' potentials with a large value of the repulsive energy at short distances , it is possible to use the `` soft '' effective potentials for which the energy at short distances is a phenomenological adjustable parameter determined by comparing some measurable quantity with an experiment .",
    "it is this idea that was laid in the basis of calculations of nuclei by the self - consistent field method @xcite . in these calculations , in order to bypass the problems arising due to the strong repulsive core @xcite , the effective interaction is introduced without connection to the basic interaction of free nucleons @xcite .",
    "the simplest way of modification of the potentials ( [ eq13 ] ) is the replacement of their short - range part by a constant , so that @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "some of the known model potentials can be chosen as the long - range part .",
    "thus , for the sutherland potential @xmath55 more realistic is the kihara potential @xmath56 , % } % \\end{array}\\ ] ] which contains an additional parameter of the length dimension as compared with the lennard - jones potential , and turns into the latter at @xmath57 ( [ eq12 ] ) .    in numerical calculations in this paper",
    "we will use the morse potential ( [ eq14 ] ) as the long - range part .",
    "although the morse potential is finite at all distances , its energy value at zero is still large so that the positive part of this potential , according to the above said , will be replaced by a constant thereby introducing an additional adjustable parameter of the length dimension .",
    "as regards to the choice of the potential for three - body interactions , very little is known about these potentials .",
    "note that the derivation from first principles of the potential of interaction of three atoms as structureless entities presents a complex quantum mechanical problem @xcite .",
    "a review of the present state of the problem of three - body forces is given in paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , the three - body potential can be chosen in the form proposed in ref .",

    "% \\end{array}\\ ] ] such choice is characteristic in that in the limit @xmath60 the potential ( [ eq19 ] ) turns into the three - body potential of zero radius which , as shown in paper @xcite , gives no contribution into the self - consistent field . in principle",
    ", the model three - body potential can be chosen to depend on the three distances between three particles @xmath61 in this paper we will use in calculations the potential just of this kind , which is taken in the form of `` semi - transparent sphere '' potential : @xmath62 the potential ( [ eq21 ] ) is nonzero only in the case when distances between each pair of three particles are less than @xmath63 .",
    "both pair and three - body interactions give contribution into the self - consistent potential ( [ eq03 ] ) @xmath64 , @xmath65 . in the case of pair forces @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the pair interaction potential , @xmath68 .",
    "the one - particle density matrix has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and the particle number density is @xmath71 .",
    "the contribution of three - body forces is determined by the relations @xcite : @xmath72 for the three - body potential depending on distances between particles ( [ eq20 ] ) : @xmath73 here @xmath74 @xmath75",
    "in this section we will give the results of calculations of dependencies of the effective mass , pressure and chemical potential on the particle number density at zero temperature , for the effective pair potential of type ( [ eq15 ] ) with the morse potential ( [ eq14 ] ) chosen as the long - range part .",
    "the results of calculations will be compared with experimental data on the liquid @xmath0he @xcite at temperature close to zero .",
    "note that the normal fermi system is considered in this paper , while @xmath0he passes into the superfluid state at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , since the superfluid transition temperature @xmath76 is very low , of the order of several millikelvins , and it is much less than the fermi temperature , then under the fulfilment of the condition @xmath77 the normal system can be considered with a sufficient accuracy , assuming it to be at zero temperature .",
    "the choice of the morse potential as the long - range part is convenient because , in particular , it admits the derivation of analytical expressions in some cases .",

    "the choice of adjustable parameters in the pair potential will be discussed below .",
    "it is seen that at low densities the quasiparticle effective mass increases with increasing the density , which is in qualitative agreement with the calculation for the low - density fermi gas @xcite , and then decreases with the density .",
    "qualitatively this result can be understood on the ground of the general formula ( [ eq07 ] ) .",
    "as one can see , the positive part of the potential describing the repulsion leads to a decrease of the effective mass , and its attractive negative part gives a contribution that increases the effective mass . with increasing the density ,",
    "the average distance between particles decreases and , therefore , the role of the interparticle repulsion increases leading to a decrease of the effective mass .",
    "the obtained result does not correspond to the experimentally observed dependence of the effective mass on the pressure in the liquid @xmath0he , which increases with increasing the pressure @xcite .",

    ", the pressure appears to be a nonmonotonic function of the density .",
    "there is a range of pressures in which to each value of the pressure there correspond the two densities , the larger of which matches the liquid and the lower matches the gas . to obtain the equilibrium condition between phases , from the formula ( [ eq05 ] ) we have to calculate the chemical potential which for the modified morse potential has the form @xmath85 + % } \\vspace{2mm}\\\\% \\displaystyle{% \\hspace{4mm}+\\frac{4\\varepsilon e^{2\\gamma}}{3\\pi}\\bigg[i_{\\mu1}\\bigg(k_fr_*,\\frac{2\\gamma}{k_fr_0}\\bigg)-\\frac{3}{2}i_{\\mu3}\\bigg(k_fr_*,\\frac{2\\gamma}{k_fr_0}\\bigg)\\bigg]- % \\frac{8\\varepsilon e^{\\gamma}}{3\\pi}\\bigg[i_{\\mu1}\\bigg(k_fr_*,\\frac{\\gamma}{k_fr_0}\\bigg)-\\frac{3}{2}i_{\\mu3}\\bigg(k_fr_*,\\frac{\\gamma}{k_fr_0}\\bigg)\\bigg ] . % } % \\end{array}\\ ] ] here the designations are used : @xmath86 the dependence of the chemical potential on the density is shown in figure 3 . in the ideal fermi gas at zero temperature the chemical potential is positive and coincides with the fermi energy .",
    "the presence of the interaction between particles , in particular the attraction at long distances , leads to a considerable change in the dependence of the chemical potential on the particle number density as compared with the case of the ideal gas . as seen ( figure 3 )",
    ", this dependence can appear to be nonmonotonic and the sign of the chemical potential to be negative .",
    "now we discuss the question of choosing the parameters of the effective potential .",
    "the distance to the minimum and the depth of the well of the standard model potentials are known @xcite .",
    "for helium they are @xmath87k , @xmath88 . generally speaking ,",
    "when using the effective potential there is no reason to choose the values of these parameters to be equal to the parameters of the interaction potential of free particles .",
    "however , in numerical calculations in this paper we assume that @xmath89 do not differ considerably from the above mentioned values",
    ". there remain the two adjustable parameters @xmath80 and @xmath90 , which should be chosen from additional considerations .",
    "the character of the dependence of the total pressure on the density depends on the choice of the parameter @xmath91 . at a sufficiently large value of this parameter",
    "the pressure monotonically increases with increasing the density . with decreasing",
    "the noted parameter the dependence @xmath92 becomes nonmonotonic , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "thermodynamically stable are the regions on which @xmath93 .",
    "there exists a range of pressures to which there correspond the two values of the density , the lower density matches the vapor and the larger matches the liquid .",
    "it is known from the experiment @xcite that the pressure of the saturated vapors of @xmath0he tends to zero as temperature goes to zero .",
    "therefore , one of the conditions which should be satisfied when choosing the adjustable parameters is the requirement that the larger , different from zero density , at zero pressure should coincide with the observed density of the liquid helium .",
    "since the equilibrium condition between phases is the equality of their chemical potentials , then the second condition which should be satisfied is the equality to zero of the liquid chemical potential , equalling the vapor chemical potential as its density tends to zero .",
    "thus , the two adjustable parameters of the effective potential are determined from the conditions @xmath94 with account of the fact that the density of the liquid @xmath0he close to zero temperature @xmath95 , we find @xmath96k .",
    "dependencies of the effective mass , pressure and chemical potential from the density in figures _ 1 _  _ 3 _ are calculated for such values of these parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the value of the adjustable parameter @xmath90 is considerably less than the value of the morse potential ( [ eq14 ] ) at zero @xmath97k .",
    "the effective mass @xmath98 calculated for the indicated values of parameters proves to be approximately four times less than the effective mass of quasiparticles in the liquid @xmath0he and , as shown in figure 1 , decreases with increasing the density .",
    "this does not agree with the observed rising dependence of the effective mass on the pressure @xcite .",
    "the noted circumstance , apparently , is not connected with the choice of the specific effective potential , since qualitatively similar dependencies arise also when using the effective potentials that are different from the morse potential used in this paper .",
    "it can be suggested that the noted disagreement is connected with the contribution from three - body interactions which role will be considered in the next section .",
    "as a possible reason that explains an increase of the effective mass with increasing the pressure and , consequently , the density , let us consider the contribution from three - body interactions @xcite .",
    "the role of three - body interactions in the fermi system is theoretically studied in paper @xcite where , in particular , it is shown that three - body forces give contribution into the self - consistent potential only with account of their nonlocality .",
