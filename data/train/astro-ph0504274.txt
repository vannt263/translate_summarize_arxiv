    "observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite offer the hope of revealing much about the properties of galaxy clusters and the evolution of large - scale structure .",
    "several instruments are being built ( act , spt , apex , planck ) that will make use of the sz effect to produce deep galaxy cluster surveys , and upgrades to current experiments , such as suzie iii , will produce deep targeted observations of known galaxy clusters .",
    "these surveys , in addition to measuring the number density of clusters , can , in principle , reveal each galaxy cluster s peculiar velocity , gas temperature , and optical depth , if the sz information is fully exploited .",
    "the aim of this paper is to quantify some of the difficulties with determining these individual cluster parameters from future sz measurements and to discuss what cluster parameters these future surveys can constrain .",
    "the sz effect is a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background caused by an intervening galaxy cluster . the hot gas in the intracluster medium inverse compton scatters the microwave photons creating this distortion .",
    "for reviews of the sz effect see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the dependence of this spectral distortion on the gas temperature ( @xmath7 ) , radial peculiar velocity ( @xmath8 ) , and optical depth ( @xmath2 ) , including relativistic corrections , has been computed in several papers @xcite . since the amplitude of this distortion is also a function of frequency , sz measurements at three different observing frequencies would ideally be enough to disentangle the three unknowns ( @xmath9 ) contributing to the sz signal .",
    "some first attempts to determine cluster temperatures using the relativistic sz effect were carried out by @xcite and @xcite , the former simulating clusters observed with planck and the latter providing a temperature estimate of abell 2163 with quite large uncertainties .",
    "more recently , @xcite has developed code to extract cluster parameters using the sz effect which results in rather large errors if given prospective data from upcoming surveys .",
    "the difficulty , as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , is that there exist degeneracies among the physically interesting parameters ( @xmath9 ) that can best be broken by choosing one frequency relatively low ( around 30 ghz ) and placing the other two around 150 ghz and 300 ghz .",
    "in addition , the observations need to be of arcminute - resolution to resolve individual clusters .",
    "a 30 ghz observing band is not a realistic option for upcoming arcminute - resolution bolometer based instruments ( such as act , spt , and apex ) since high - sensitivity bolometers sharply lose sensitivity below 90 ghz and the single - dish diameter required for arcminute - resolution observations at 30 ghz is unrealistically large . in addition",
    ", large interferometers capable of observing at 30 ghz with arcminute - resolution can only view small areas of the sky at a time , making a large survey impractical .",
    "thus it is important to determine what information about individual galaxy clusters these future sz surveys will be able to constrain given the reality that they will have approximately arcminute - resolution observations at or above 90 ghz .    in this paper",
    "we make a preliminary investigation of information we can potentially extract from sz measurements . in particular , we do not include the effects of a variety of real world complications including radio and infrared point sources , galactic dust , non - sz microwave fluctuations or instrumental systematic effects . while these are certainly important considerations for any data set , the goal of this paper is to elucidate the maximum information about individual clusters we can in principle obtain .",
    "rough estimates of the impact of these various contributions are briefly discussed in  8 .",
    "detailed analysis including these effects is in progress .    in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the sz effect . in ",
    "3 we investigate how varying observing frequencies and detector sensitivity affects parameter degeneracies and parameter extraction . in ",
    "4 a markov chain / fisher matrix method is used to determine which cluster parameters can be well constrained by future sz measurements , and in  5 this method is applied to simulated nbody+gasdynamics clusters and the results presented . in  6 we discuss the near - linearity of the sz intensity shift with respect to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and show the resulting close correspondence between the constrained effective parameters from 2d sz images and line - of - sight integrals through the 3d cluster . in  7 we show that an independent measurement of @xmath0 breaks the parameter degeneracy and use a simple analytical model to show that the velocity thus determined is approximately the optical - depth - weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight .",
    "we then use a markov chain to calculate errors on cluster velocities and optical depths given x - ray temperature priors . in  8 we discuss sources of contamination to the sz signal , and we conclude with a summary of the above .",
    "when microwave photons pass through the hot gas in the intracluster medium of a galaxy cluster , roughly @xmath10 of the photons interact with the free electrons in the gas .",
    "these photons are inverse compton scattered and energy is transferred from the hot electrons to the cool photons , causing a slight distortion of the microwave background spectrum .",
    "this up - scattering of photons causes the intensity of photons with frequencies below about 220 ghz to decrease while the intensity of photons with higher frequencies increases .",
    "this process is called the thermal sz effect , and it causes an effective temperature shift relative to the mean microwave background temperature on the order of one part in @xmath11 . if the galaxy cluster has some bulk velocity with respect to the microwave background rest frame , then this will doppler shift the scattered microwave photons and cause an additional spectral distortion . this further shift in the microwave spectrum",
    "is referred to as the kinematic sz effect and is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal sz effect .",
    "the derivation of the combined sz effect can be found in @xcite and @xcite , and more recent papers ( e.g. @xcite ) have included relativistic corrections to these derivations .",
    "the expression for the sz effect we use throughout this work is from @xcite and is given by @xmath12 }                                           \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\\tau ( \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{c})^{2 } \\bigl[\\frac{1}{3 } y_{0 } + \\theta_{e } ( \\frac{5}{6 } y_{0 } + \\frac{2}{3 } y_{1 } ) \\bigr ]                                           \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\\tau \\frac{v}{c } \\bigl[1 + \\theta_{e } c_{1 } + \\theta_{e}^{2 } c_{2 } \\bigr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath8 is the peculiar line - of - sight velocity , @xmath17 is the optical depth , and the @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s are numbers that depend on frequency in a well - defined way . note that @xmath20 is equivalent to the well known compton - y parameter which we will show is tightly constrained .",
    "the most dominant terms in this expression are proportional to @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath21 .",
    "it is also important to note that the above expression is independent of redshift .",
    "this makes the sz effect a powerful probe of the high - redshift universe because the amplitude of the sz signal does not weaken at high redshift ( for fixed @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath2 ) , unlike x - ray and optical signals .",
    "since this microwave intensity shift for a given frequency is a non - trivial function of the cluster s gas temperature , peculiar velocity , and optical depth , one could hope that choosing at least three well placed observing frequencies would allow these three cluster parameters to be separated and measured . in practice",
    ", the observing frequencies and sensitivities available to upcoming sz surveys result in degeneracies among these parameters .",
    "these degeneracies are illustrated in the next section .",
    "to understand the intrinsic limitations in determining a galaxy cluster s gas temperature , peculiar velocity , and optical depth from multi - frequency sz measurements , we create likelihood surfaces for these parameters and compare the 1-@xmath22 regions for various choices of observing frequencies and detector sensitivity .",
    "we do this by first assuming some region of gas with uniform temperature @xmath0 , peculiar line - of - sight velocity @xmath8 , and total optical depth @xmath2 .",
    "we neglect any transverse peculiar velocity since the full sz effect generates a temperature shift on the order of one part in @xmath11 , and the transverse velocity component of the sz effect contributes a temperature shift on the order of one part in @xmath23 .    using the expression for the intensity shift given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we calculate the change in intensity one would measure from our fiducial gas region at three different observing frequencies .",
    "we perform these calculations for several frequency sets . the first observing frequency set we choose to be ( 30 , 150 , 300 ghz ) , which is the optimal frequency set found by @xcite and roughly that found by @xcite .",
    "we also choose the sets ( 90 , 150 , 300 ghz ) and ( 145 , 225 , 265 ghz ) , the latter being the frequencies planned for act ( see @xcite ) .",
    "after obtaining the intensity shift for each of the three frequencies in each set , we change variables to the ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the three frequencies in a set .",
    "these ratios are independent of @xmath2 ( though their errors depend on @xmath2 ) , so we have two equations and two unknowns ( @xmath0 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "we eliminated @xmath2 so that we could more easily construct and view the likelihood surfaces of the remaining parameters . assuming first @xmath29 detector noise per arcminute beam and then @xmath30 noise per beam , we step through the @xmath31 parameter space and calculate the likelihood of the model described by ( @xmath0 , @xmath8 ) , given the underlying fiducial model , in the usual way .",
    "thus , we create a 2-dimensional likelihood surface for the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath8 for each observing frequency set at both detector noise levels . a 1-@xmath22 contour is then drawn for each likelihood surface by connecting all the points with @xmath32 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath22 contours we obtain from these likelihood surfaces verify that the set of frequencies 30 , 150 , 300 ghz puts tighter constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath8 than the other sets . with @xmath29 detector noise per arcminute beam , the set 145 , 225",
    ", 265 ghz exhibits a clear degeneracy between the @xmath0 and @xmath8 parameters , and with @xmath30 detector noise per arcminute beam all three frequency sets show significant degeneracy .",
    "figures 1a-1c show the comparison of 1-@xmath22 contours for 10 kev ( @xmath33 k ) gas with a line - of - sight velocity of 200 km / sec , optical depth of 0.012 , and @xmath29 detector noise .",
    "we choose gas parameters corresponding to a hot cluster because it is the case which has the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "these parameter values roughly correspond to the known cluster ms 0451 @xcite .",
    "the gas temperature is constrained to within 0.5 kev and its velocity to within 25 km / sec at the 1-@xmath22 level for 30 , 150 , and 300 ghz observing frequencies ( figure 1a ) .",
    "shifting the lowest frequency to 90 ghz increases these uncertainties by a factor of two ( figure 1b ) . using observing frequencies at 145 , 225 , and 265 ghz results in temperature uncertainties of 6 kev and velocity uncertainties of 220 km / sec ( figure 1c ) .",
    "figures 2a-2c show the 1-@xmath22 likelihood contours for 10 kev gas with a line - of - sight velocity equal to -200 km / sec , optical depth of 0.012 , and @xmath29 detector noise . comparing these to the previous group of figures indicates that a negative line - of - sight velocity somewhat increases the uncertainties obtained for all frequency sets , as has been pointed out in @xcite . adding a 30 ghz or 90 ghz observing frequency to the 145 , 225",
    ", 265 ghz frequency set with @xmath29 noise greatly reduces the 1-@xmath22 regions and makes the temperature and velocity constraints as tight as for the 30 , 150 , 300 ghz and 90 , 150 , 300 ghz frequency sets respectively .",
    "these results confirm previous results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is clear that measurements near the null of the sz effect are not particularly useful for sz studies from a signal - to - noise perspective , but such measurements will be useful for microwave observations that aim to minimize sz contamination and as a useful diagnostic of point source contamination .    with @xmath30 detector noise per arcminute beam ,",
    "figures 3a-3c show the 1-@xmath22 contours for the same 10 kev gas region with 200 km / sec line - of - sight velocity and an optical depth of 0.012 . the gas temperature is constrained to within 5 kev and the velocity to within 200 km / sec at the 1-@xmath22 level for the 30 , 150 , and 300 ghz set ( figure 3a ) .",
    "increasing the lower frequency to 90 ghz constrains the temperature to within 8 kev and the velocity to within 250 km / sec ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the 145 , 225 , and 265 ghz frequency set gives 1-@xmath22 errors of 9 kev and 350 km / sec for temperature and velocity respectively with @xmath30 detector noise ( figure 3c ) .",
    "thus to constrain the cluster parameters well using sz observations alone ( in the absence of sz signal contamination from point sources or residual primary microwave background ) , one needs both a low frequency band ( 90 ghz or lower ) and a detector sensitivity not much higher than @xmath29 per arcminute beam .",
    "we also compare the 1-@xmath22 likelihood contours for gas with different compton - y parameters keeping the observing frequencies fixed . in figure",
    "4a we see the 1-@xmath22 contour for a 7 kev gas region with an optical depth of 0.009 , 200 km / sec line - of - sight velocity , @xmath29 detector noise , and observing frequencies at 30 , 150 , and 300 ghz .",
    "figure 4b shows the 1-@xmath22 contour for a 3 kev gas region with an optical depth of 0.004 and the same line - of - sight velocity , detector noise , and observing frequencies .",
    "the 1-@xmath22 contour for the gas region with lower compton - y parameter shows a larger parameter degeneracy for the same set of observing frequencies and detector noise .",
    "this is because a decrease in compton - y parameter lowers the signal - to - noise .",
    "the signal - to - noise is reduced by two effects as one moves to lower mass clusters : a lower signal in all bands and reduced relative importance of relativistic effects .",
    "we have verified that the former is a more important contributor to parameter degeneracies than the latter .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the above 1-@xmath22 errors on @xmath0 and @xmath8 for differing observing frequencies , detector noise , and compton - y parameters for convenient reference .",
    "despite the inability of upcoming experiments like act , spt , and apex to determine all of the cluster gas parameters , they will provide tight constraints on certain combinations of parameters .",
    "the next two sections explicitly demonstrate the parameter combinations which will be determined with good precision by these kinds of experiments .",
    "we create a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) using the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath2 to find realistic error regions for all three parameters .",
    "this mcmc is made using the metropolis - hastings algorithm which randomly steps through a parameter space and accepts all points whose likelihood is greater than the previous point .",
    "if the likelihood is less than the previous point , the current point is accepted with a probability given by the ratio of the two likelihoods .",
    "a comprehensive review of mcmcs can be found in @xcite ; they were introduced into cosmology by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the region in the 3-dimensional parameter space containing @xmath34 of all the points accepted in the chain we define as the 1-@xmath22 region .",
    "this 1-@xmath22 region is projected onto 2 dimensions in the figures below .",
    "figures 5a-5c show the 1-@xmath22 regions generated by a mcmc for 10 kev gas with 200 km / sec line - of - sight velocity and an optical depth of 0.012 .",
    "the frequency set 145 , 225 , and 265 ghz was used with @xmath29 detector noise per beam to simulate act observations . in the markov chain , the parameter space was restricted to @xmath35 k ( 17 kev ) ) , @xmath36(0 , 0.02 ) , and @xmath37(-1500 km / sec , 1500 km / sec ) , and 5 million steps were used with about @xmath38 acceptance rate in the chain .",
    "in addition , each step was taken in all three parameter directions simultaneously with different step sizes in each parameter direction . from the 1-@xmath22 regions in figures 5a-5c",
    ", we can see a clear degeneracy among all three parameters .",
    "figures 6a-6c show the same 1-@xmath22 region as figures 5a-5c except using the parameter directions @xmath3 , @xmath39 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we have verified that the mcmc in either variable set gives the same results , although it is significantly more efficient to use the second set of variables .",
    "we choose this set of parameters since these are the dominant terms in the intensity shift expression in eq .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the cluster parameters lie in a nearly 1-dimensional subspace of the 3-dimensional parameter space given by @xmath3 , @xmath39 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we can find two axes within this parameter space ( both orthogonal to the degeneracy direction ) along which the cluster parameters are tightly constrained and one axis ( parallel to the degeneracy direction ) along which the cluster parameters are largely unconstrained .",
    "the three orthogonal directions in this parameter space that allow us to tightly constrain the gas parameters in two directions with one direction unconstrained correspond to the principal axes of the 1-@xmath22 error ellipsoid which is projected in 2 dimensions in figures 6a-6c . to find these principal axes",
    "we calculate a fisher matrix at the most likely point found by the mcmc .",
    "the fisher matrix describes the curvature of the likelihood surface at a given point in parameter space .",
    "it is expressed by the formula @xmath40 since we have @xmath41 , the fisher matrix becomes @xmath42 .",
    "using @xmath43 where @xmath44@xmath3/(@xmath45 k ) , @xmath21/(1 km / sec ) , @xmath5/(@xmath46 k@xmath47 ) ) , @xmath48 is the observed @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the error on @xmath51 , and averaging gives @xmath52 ( see @xcite for a good explanation of the fisher matrix and its applications . ) the eigenvectors of the fisher matrix evaluated at the minimum point of @xmath53 correspond to the principal axes of the error ellipsoid .",
    "this technique is essentially a version of principal component analysis ( pca ) . in pca",
    "it is known that the principal components one finds depend on how the variables are scaled .",
    "there is no single correct scaling to choose , but the one that is widely preferred in physical uses is scaling all the variables to order unity , which has the advantage that all the variables are weighted the same .",
    "( @xcite provides a good overview of pca . )",
    "we scale @xmath3 , @xmath21 , and @xmath5 by @xmath45 k , 1 km / sec , and @xmath46 k@xmath47 respectively , which are characteristic cluster values for these variables .",
    "the principal axes are linear combinations of the previous parameter directions such that @xmath54 where the rows of @xmath55 are the eigenvectors of @xmath56 , @xmath57 is a point in the new parameter space , and @xmath58 are the old parameter directions described above .",
    "the vector @xmath59 describes @xmath58 evaluated at the maximum likelihood point .",
    "note @xmath55 ( and thus @xmath60 ) will differ with @xmath59 , but the variation with @xmath59 is fairly weak for realistic parameter regions .",
    "roughly , the fisher matrix eigenvectors are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 normalized to unity .",
    "therefore the @xmath64 parameter is dominated by @xmath3 , and the @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters are primarily linear combinations of @xmath21 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , sz measurements provide precise measures of the @xmath67 parameter and one linear combination of the kinematic sz effect and the relativistic corrections .",
    "figures 7a-7c show that the gas parameters for this fiducial model are constrained to within @xmath10 in the @xmath64 direction , @xmath68 in the @xmath65 direction , and @xmath69 in the c direction . for a 4 kev gas region with 200 km",
    "/ sec line - of - sight velocity , an optical depth of 0.005 , and detector noise of @xmath29 , the gas parameters are constrained to within @xmath70 in the @xmath64 direction , @xmath71 in the @xmath65 direction , and @xmath72 in the @xmath66 direction .",
    "the gas parameters are constrained to within @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 in the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 directions respectively for a 10 kev gas region with 200 km / sec line - of - sight velocity , an optical depth of 0.012 , and @xmath76 detector noise .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 parameters , which are linear combinations of @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath21 , are therefore well constrained by an act - like sz survey with observing frequencies near 145 , 225 , and 265 ghz and @xmath29 detector noise .",
    "this technique can be applied to determine the constrained gas parameters from any multi - frequency sz observations that are without arcminute - resolution observations at frequencies below 100 ghz or that have low frequency information but with a noise component considerably larger than @xmath29 . by combining this gas information from sz surveys with a data set that can constrain just one of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 ( such as an x - ray survey of clusters that constrains @xmath0 for each cluster )",
    ", all three cluster gas parameters can be well determined .",
    "we now apply this technique to simulated sz observations which we generate using simulated galaxy clusters . in  5.1 we describe the two simulated clusters we use , one about 9 kev and the other about 3 kev , and in  5.2 we discuss how sz simulations are created from these .",
    "the results of applying the technique in  4 to simulated act - like sz maps of both clusters and to simulated planck - like sz maps of the 9 kev cluster are contained in  5.3 .",
    "the clusters we use are two high - resolution 3d cluster simulations that were made using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) nbody+gasdynamics code @xcite .",
    "these clusters were simulated using a @xmath77cdm model with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "each cluster has a redshift of z=0.43 and is contained in a cube of side length 2 mpc ( @xmath82 6 arcminutes ) .",
    "each grid element within the larger cube has a side length of 0.0078 mpc ( @xmath82 0.02 arcminute ) .",
    "the simulations track the density of dark matter particles , the density of gas particles , the gas temperature , and the 3-dimensional gas velocity for each grid element .",
    "one cluster is similar in size to the coma cluster and has a mass of @xmath83 , an optical depth of @xmath84 , and an average gas temperature of 9 kev .",

    "both clusters have characteristic bulk velocities of several hundred km / sec .",
    "the morphology of the virgo - size cluster indicates that it consists of a recent merger of two smaller clusters .",
    "these cluster simulations do not include the effects of gas cooling , stellar feedback , magnetic fields , and thermal conduction . for a more detailed cluster description see @xcite and @xcite .      to create a simulation of an sz observation , we choose one of the cluster simulations and a set of observing frequencies . the sz intensity shift that microwave photons would experience passing through each grid element",
    "is calculated using eq .",

    ". we use a 3 ghz frequency bandwidth , as opposed to a more realistic bandwidth of @xmath82 25 ghz , for numerical convenience . however , the bandwidth size has a negligible effect on cluster constraints , which we verified by redoing some of our results with a 25 ghz bandwidth .",
    "thus , for each frequency band we end up with an sz cube of @xmath87 values .",
    "this cube is then projected along the line of sight into a two - dimensional sz distortion of the sky .",
    "we do not include the primary microwave background in our simulations , assuming it is perfectly subtracted , since it varies on scales large compared to the cluster .",
    "the main effect of residual primary microwave contamination will be as a source of noise for extracting estimates of the peculiar velocity from the constrained parameters .",

    ", we smooth each image by convolving it with a gaussian beam , and increase the pixel size of our images to sizes realistic for upcoming sz surveys by averaging together smaller pixels .",

    "the cluster parameters we constrain using this method are really effective parameters that correspond to integrals of the cluster parameters along a line of sight .",
    "the sz intensity ( eq . [ 1 ] ) is not linear , so there is no guarantee that the sum of sz signals of varying temperature and velocity can be fit to a single temperature and velocity .",
    "we fit the resulting sz intensity as a function of frequency to a model with a single temperature and velocity and call the constrained parameters @xmath90 ; we discuss what integrals these effective parameters correspond to within the three dimensional cluster in  6 .",
    "figures 12a-12c show the projected 1-@xmath22 contours for the @xmath90 parameters for the central pixel of act - like sz images of the simulated 9 kev cluster .",
    "we do this analysis on a pixel - by - pixel basis to potentially obtain the most information about cluster substructure .",
    "( see @xcite for some discussion of substructure . ) in a low signal - to - noise experiment or as a means to average out substructure , it could be advantageous to add together pixels .",
    "the 1-@xmath22 errors on @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for this central pixel are 0.06 , 0.5 , and 5 respectively .",

    "clusters with larger sz signals ( and thus larger @xmath0 s and @xmath2 s ) tend to have larger @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 parameters , and this is borne out in the comparison of our results for the 9 kev and 3 kev clusters . since the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 parameters have been scaled to roughly order unity for characteristic cluster values , the absolute errors are a meaningful reflection of how well the gas properties are constrained .",
    "similar results are obtained from the act - like sz simulation of the 3 kev cluster and the planck - like sz simulation of the 9 kev cluster .",

    "these figures demonstrate @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "thus @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are constrained to a small region of the available parameter space , with the first two components especially well - constrained .",

    "these figures show @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , indicating again that the measurements are providing strong constraints within the available parameter space .",
    "these results demonstrate that the @xmath91 and @xmath92 cluster parameters are well constrained and @xmath93 is moderately well constrained by sz observations typical of act and planck , assuming perfect primary microwave background and point source removal .",
    "the cluster gas parameters we have constrained in the previous sections using a projected two dimensional sz image correspond to integrals along the line of sight of the three dimensional cluster .",
    "previous studies of cluster projection effects have been done indicating that the temperature in principle obtainable from sz measurements is really a compton - averaged quantity ( i.e. each line - of - sight integral of @xmath0 is weighted by the compton parameter ) @xcite . here",
    "we show that the line - of - sight integrals corresponding to the @xmath90 parameters are even more straightforward .",
    "the reason for the simple correspondence is that the sz intensity shift given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) is nearly linear with respect to @xmath106 , @xmath21 , and @xmath107 .",
    "these three terms are the most dominant terms in the expression and represent most of the change in intensity for temperatures of several kev and velocities of several hundred km / s . if @xmath108 were exactly a function only of @xmath106 , @xmath21 , and @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , then @xmath108 would be exactly a linear function of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . in that case , the measured @xmath90 would be equal to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , and the sum is over the gas properties @xmath111 of each element @xmath112 along the line of sight .    the full sz intensity shift expression in eq . ( 1 ) includes terms non - linear in @xmath106 , @xmath21 , and @xmath107 .",
    "however , the addition of these non - linear terms in the calculation of @xmath113 integrated along a line of sight only introduces a slight bias between @xmath90 and @xmath114 . in figures 12 - 14 ,",
    "within the 1-@xmath22 contours of @xmath90 , we indicate the best fit @xmath90 found by the mcmc , for a given noise realization , by a star ( @xmath115 ) . the best fit @xmath90 obtained",
    "if the clusters are observed with an ideal instrument without detector noise are indicated by dots ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "diamond shapes ( @xmath117 ) mark the values of the line - of - sight integrals given by @xmath118 and calculated using the 3d cluster simulations . in figure 12a ,",
    "the difference between @xmath91 from an ideal , no noise instrument and from the line - of - sight integral is @xmath119 .",
    "the difference between @xmath92 from an ideal instrument and from the line - of - sight integral is @xmath120 .",
    "clearly , in the absence of detector noise , the correspondence between @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the line - of - sight integrals is very close .",
    "moreover , the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the line - of - sight integrals given realistic detector noise is still well within the 1-@xmath22 errors on @xmath91 and @xmath92 given by the mcmc .",
    "similar results can be seen in figures 13a and 14a .",
    "these simulations demonstrate an agreement to within 1-@xmath22 between the @xmath91 and @xmath92 parameters constrained by sz measurements and line - of - sight integrals given by @xmath118 .",
    "figure 15 shows this correspondence more explicitly .",
    "plotted on the y - axis are best - fit @xmath90 obtained via a mcmc using intensities from simulated noise - free sz images of the 9 kev and 3 kev clusters assuming act - like observations . on the x - axis",
    "are plotted @xmath121 for the corresponding lines of sight .",
    "four different lines of sight through both the 9 kev and 3 kev simulated clusters are plotted .",
    "these lines of sight are 0 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 from the central pixel of the simulated sz images .",
    "filled shapes correspond to the 9 kev cluster and unfilled shapes to the 3 kev cluster . for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 parameters , which can be well constrained ,",
    "their equivalence to @xmath114 is extremely close .",
    "this confirms the near linearity of the sz intensity shift with respect to the a , b , and c parameters .",
    "the @xmath93 parameters demonstrate some scatter around the @xmath122 line , and this is because the degeneracy in the @xmath66 direction prevents a mcmc from settling on the correct @xmath93 value .",
    "if we could tightly constrain @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 via sz measurements , we could solve for the quantities @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , where the subscript @xmath2 corresponds to optical - depth - weighted integrals ( e.g. @xmath126 ) .",
    "from these one can find @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , following the algebra in @xcite , where the subscript @xmath67 corresponds to a pressure - weighted integral .",
    "therefore sz measurements would constrain the pressure - weighted temperature ( arising from the relativistic corrections ) , the optical - depth - weighted velocity times a correction factor and the optical depth times a similar correction factor which is the ratio of different weighted temperatures . since degeneracies will allow sz measurements to constrain only @xmath91 and @xmath92 , information from an external source",
    "will be needed to constrain the above physically interesting quantities .",
    "assuming contamination sources can be dealt with effectively , future sz observations should be able to constrain two quantities given by @xmath132 where the @xmath66 s are elements of the matrix @xmath110 defined in eq .",
    "it is conceivable that temperature measurements from an x - ray survey of clusters could allow the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath133 .",
    "formally x - ray observations would need to provide a constraint on @xmath134 , where the @xmath66 s are known constants .",
    "however , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are not obviously given by x - ray observations .",
    "an x - ray derived temperature is also not equivalent to @xmath135 .",
    "the two may differ by as much as 1 kev @xcite . if x - ray observations gave @xmath137 and it was true that @xmath138 , then the effective velocity we would get from a mcmc , after adding the @xmath139 prior , would be equal to @xmath133 . for our",
    "9 kev simulated cluster , @xmath140 and @xmath136 agree to within @xmath141 on average , and for our 3 kev simulated cluster , the two agree to within @xmath142 on average .    to get an estimate of the biases incurred by not having the correct weighted temperatures , we assume @xmath138 and add a temperature prior of @xmath135 to our mcmc . adding a @xmath135 prior , in the manner we discuss further in  7.2 , we find for the central pixel of the 9 kev cluster , from simulated , noise - free , act - like sz images , an effective velocity of 230 km / sec from the mcmc and an optical - depth - weighted line - of - sight velocity of 218 km / sec from the three dimensional cluster simulation . for the central pixel of the 3 kev cluster sz image , we find an effective velocity of -10 km / sec from the mcmc and an optical - depth - weighted line - of - sight velocity of -3 km / sec from the three dimensional cluster simulation .",
    "the bias between the velocity from the mcmc and @xmath133 is most likely due to the breakdown of the @xmath138 assumption .    to quantify the bias incurred from @xmath139 differing from @xmath135 , we add a @xmath143 1 kev offset to our @xmath135 prior .",
    "we find for the central pixel of the 9 kev cluster sz image , an effective velocity of 228 km / sec from the mcmc for both + and - 1 kev offsets .",
    "we find for the central pixel of the 3 kev cluster sz image , an effective velocity of -45 km / sec from the mcmc for a + 1kev offset and an effective velocity of 6 km / sec for a - 1 kev offset .",
    "this would suggest a total bias between the measured effective velocity and @xmath133 of about 15 km / sec for the 9 kev cluster and between 10 and 40 km / sec for the 3 kev cluster .      to determine realistic errors on @xmath144 and @xmath2 from adding a measurement of @xmath145 to our simulated sz data",
    ", we again use a mcmc .",
    "we weight each point in our mcmc by the factor @xmath146 where we calculate @xmath147 from the 3d cluster simulation and @xmath148 is the assigned measurement error on @xmath145 .",
    "for a 1 kev error on @xmath145 , our act simulation of the 9 kev cluster gives @xmath149 km / sec and @xmath150 for the central pixel .",
    "our act simulation of the 3 kev cluster gives @xmath151 km / sec and @xmath152 for the central pixel .",
    "assuming a 2 kev error on @xmath145 , the act simulation of the 9 kev cluster gives @xmath153 km / sec and @xmath152 , and the act simulation of the 3 kev cluster gives @xmath154 km / sec and @xmath155 .",
    "our planck simulation of the 9 kev cluster gives @xmath156 km / sec and @xmath157 for a 1 kev error on @xmath145 and @xmath158 km / sec and @xmath159 for a 2 kev error , for the central pixel .",
    "table [ table2 ] lists these 1-@xmath22 errors for convenient reference .",
    "the errors obtained on @xmath160 and @xmath161 from our mcmc are smaller than those obtained using a fisher matrix . however , the mcmc errors are more accurate than those from a fisher matrix since a fisher matrix approximates the likelihood surface by an ellipsoidal gaussian , which can result in overestimated errors for likelihood surfaces with strong spatial curvature such as these .",
    "these results show that , in the absence of contamination from imperfect point source and primary microwave background removal , adding x - ray temperature measurements to the data from upcoming act - like sz surveys can determine cluster peculiar velocities to within 100 km / sec or less .",
    "large - scale velocity fields obtained from galaxy clusters out to high redshift could provide an interesting probe of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "major sources of possible contamination have been neglected in this exercise . in particular , it is possible that primary and secondary microwave fluctuations and point sources ( both radio and infrared ) could be problematic .",
    "primary fluctuations are in some ways both the largest and the smallest concern .",
    "the fluctuation amplitudes are on the order of 100 @xmath162 and have the exact same spectral behavior as the kinematic sz effect , providing a noise source that is an order of magnitude larger than the signal",
    ". however , these fluctuations will be highly coherent over the extent of the cluster , so the pixel - by - pixel component separation will naturally measure this extended emission . at that point , a simple spatial filter can be applied to remove the primary microwave fluctuations .",
    "this spatial filter will have the effect of removing roughly half of the cluster kinematic sz signal @xcite , thereby reducing the signal - to - noise by approximately this same factor .",
    "secondary fluctuations will be dominated by kinematic sz from the quasi - linear regime ( the vishniac effect ; @xcite ) and the thermal sz background .",
    "the kinematic sz fluctuations are expected to be below the pixel noise , and therefore subdominant , the thermal sz background will simply add noise to the component that is separated as thermal sz .",
    "the rms is expected to be roughly 10 @xmath162 , which will most likely serve as the dominant source of noise for this component . however ,",
    "this is much smaller than the expected thermal sz signal from each cluster and should not impact the component separation process at a noticeable level .",
    "radio point sources that are uncorrelated with galaxy clusters are not a concern @xcite , but radio point sources within galaxy clusters can `` fill in '' the sz decrement and severely impact cluster sz measurements .",
    "this is a long - standing concern for low frequency sz measurements @xcite , and could be a concern even at frequencies as high as 150 ghz .",
    "the spectra of radio sources up to such high frequencies are not well known , but very rough estimates can be made of the most likely contamination .",
    "radio surveys at 1.4 ghz have been done of nearby abell clusters @xcite and distant x - ray selected clusters @xcite that find that a typical galaxy cluster has of order one radio source at 1.4 ghz that would be of order a few mjy at a cosmological distance .",
    "detailed studies of spectra of bright radio sources indicate @xcite that typical radio sources have spectra that are falling and steepening with frequency .",
    "in particular , in their sample they found only a handful of sources that were as bright at 40 ghz as at 1.4 ghz .",
    "most sources with rising spectra at 1.4 ghz eventually turned over and had lower fluxes at 40 ghz than at 1.4 ghz , indicating that studies based on spectral indices at low frequency will not provide accurate estimates of behavior at high frequencies .",
    "assuming that cluster sources have the same spectral behavior and that the steepening at high frequencies continues , this would indicate that only a few percent of clusters will have a radio source contributing of order mjy flux at 150 ghz . in this handful of clusters",
    ", radio sources will be a concern , as this flux would be an order of magnitude larger than the pixel noise .",
    "however , in the majority of clusters the contamination due to cluster radio galaxies would be comparable to or smaller than the pixel noise .",
    "infrared point sources , consisting largely of dusty star forming galaxies , are likely to be a major source of contamination @xcite .",
    "a detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this paper , but the results of @xcite suggest that hot clusters ( with temperatures above about 6 kev ) will have a large enough sz signal that the infrared point sources can be estimated simultaneously with the thermal sz and kinematic sz signals , assuming an independent measure of the gas temperature . in this work",
    "we have found that the three measurements by an act - like experiment provide only two effective constraints , suggesting that there is redundancy in the measurements and that an additional degree of freedom ( infrared point sources ) could be allowed without significantly degrading the constraints .",
    "the surest solution is to use alma to measure the relevant point source fluxes . as a point of comparison , alma could image 100 square degrees ( comparable to the act survey area ) to a point source sensitivity of 0.1 mjy at 140 ghz in less than 1 month .",
    "if one were to instead focus on the inner 2 of the largest 100 galaxy clusters , this would take several hours of observing time .",
    "note that these same observations could be used to estimate the sz effects , but the small primary beam of alma ( due to the large telescopes ) would require careful mosaicing of the cluster to avoid resolving out much of the cluster flux .",
    "instruments such as act , spt , apex , and planck will find thousands of galaxy clusters in the near future via sz observations .",
    "in addition to determining the number density of clusters , which can put limits on cosmological parameters , these surveys will reveal information about the gas properties of individual clusters .",
    "ideally , sz observations would be made in at least three frequency bands with one frequency around 300 ghz , one around 150 ghz , and another either near 90 ghz or better yet near 30 ghz .",
    "arcminute - resolution observations at those frequencies with @xmath163 detector noise would tightly constrain the cluster gas temperature , line - of - sight velocity , and optical depth in the absence of excessive point source and primary microwave background contamination from imperfect subtraction . without this set of sz observations ,",
    "parameter degeneracies prevent disentanglement of these three cluster parameters .",
    "current limitations in technology and instrument availability will make it impractical to obtain 30 ghz , arcminute - resolution , @xmath164 sensitivity , sz observations of the majority of the clusters that will be found .",
    "sz surveys that will have 90 ghz channels will still have parameter degeneracies resulting from detector noise @xmath165 .",
    "however , we find that upcoming sz surveys will be able to tightly constrain two cluster gas parameters which are linear combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath21 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the constrained parameters are roughly @xmath3 and a single linear combination of the other two terms .",
    "we demonstrated that this is the case for both individual isothermal gas regions and for 3d simulated nbody + hydro clusters .",
    "the sz intensity shift that microwave photons experience passing through a cluster is nearly a linear function of @xmath3 , @xmath166 , and @xmath5 , these being the most dominant terms in the intensity shift expression .",
    "this near - linearity results in a close correspondence between the two effective parameters sz surveys will constrain and simple line - of - sight integrals of these parameters through the three dimensional cluster .",
    "we illustrated this correspondence with our three dimensional cluster simulations .",
    "this will greatly simplify data analysis of multi - frequency sz data : it will not be necessary ( or useful ) to model the intensity as a superposition of elements along the line of sight but instead the sz effect can be modeled as a single gas element with a single effective temperature and velocity .    we have shown that a temperature constraint added to sz data breaks the parameter degeneracy between @xmath2 , @xmath145 , and @xmath144 . using the above linearity , we show that the effective velocity constrained by combining sz with an independent temperature measure is approximately the optical - depth - weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight .",
    "since x - ray derived temperatures do not give us precisely the weighted temperature measurements that are required to determine @xmath131 exactly , we find the measured effective velocity will be biased away from @xmath167 by about 15 to 40 km / sec , with a smaller bias for hotter , relaxed clusters .",
    "errors on @xmath2 and @xmath144 are calculated via a markov chain monte carlo method assuming a temperature prior in addition to sz data .",
    "we find for act - like sz simulations of our 9 kev cluster , @xmath160 = 20 km / sec and @xmath161 = 0.002 for a 1 kev error on @xmath145 , and @xmath160 = 40 km / sec and @xmath161 = 0.004 for a 2 kev error on @xmath145 . for our 3 kev simulated cluster , @xmath160 = 60 km / sec and @xmath161 = 0.004 , and @xmath160 = 100 km / sec and @xmath161 = 0.005 for 1 kev and 2 kev errors on @xmath145 respectively .",
    "the markov chain errors we find on @xmath144 and @xmath2 are smaller than those obtained via a fisher matrix .",
    "a fisher matrix overestimates the errors because the likelihood surface is strongly curved in this parameter representation , strongly violating the implicit assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry over the parameter region of interest .",
    "note that the errors on velocities will be increased when residual primary microwave contamination is included , and that bulk flows within the clusters provide comparable noise in matching observed peculiar velocities to the true bulk velocity of the cluster @xcite .",
    "if an independent cluster temperature estimate from x - ray spectroscopy is unavailable , temperature estimates can also be obtained from either the cluster velocity dispersion @xcite or the cluster integrated sz flux @xcite and scaling relations . since an accuracy of only 2 kev",
    "is required on an additional temperature measurement to obtain very interesting velocity estimates , the use of these scaling relations could prove to be a very beneficial tool .    as discussed in  8 , contamination from primary microwave background fluctuations and point sources add another source of noise that must be factored into these parameter constraints .",
    "radio point sources due to emission from galaxy cluster members themselves and infrared point sources will both be non - negligible sources of sz signal contamination .",
    "studies of the effect point source contamination will have on cluster parameter extraction have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both studies have found that the contamination could potentially be serious ; however the latter study considers the effect of point source contamination if no attempt is made to filter point sources out of the observations or model them into the parameter extraction routines .",
    "moreover , even in the worst case point source contamination scenario , observations with an instrument such as alma will allow straightforward point source subtraction from sz images .",
    "clearly either filtering techniques or additional alma type observations will be needed to minimize both the point source and primary microwave background contamination of sz signals .",
    "near - future sz surveys will open the door to a wealth of information about galaxy clusters . determining the number density of galaxy clusters as a function of redshift is potentially a strong probe of dark energy s equation of state and variability over time @xcite . however , galaxy clusters offer more information that can also yield cosmological information",
    ". the kinematic sz signature of galaxy clusters can reveal large - scale velocity fields out to high redshift that can provide an alternative probe of large - scale dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "cluster optical depth information yields cluster gas mass estimates , and optical depths are crucial to any of the tests that have been proposed using the ( _ extremely _ difficult to measure ) polarization of scattered microwave photons at the position of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the gas parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath8 of individual galaxy clusters are of direct interest for cluster astrophysics .",
    "arcminute - resolution sz observations can begin to probe cluster substructure and offer more information about cluster gas profiles and internal gas dynamics . in summary ,",
    "sz observations are entering new territory , where large scale surveys will offer new understandings of galaxy clusters and cosmology .",
