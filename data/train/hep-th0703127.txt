    "studies of pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) yang - mills theories at finite temperature @xmath2 represent an important subject in modern high energy physics and a fundamental step toward the analysis of the properties of the quark - gluon - plasma . in particular , the question if and for which temperatures a gas of ( almost ) free gluons offers a valid approximate description of such strong interacting theories goes to the heart of the problem .",
    "a key - quantity to address this issue is the trace of the stress energy tensor @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy density and the pressure of the system .",
    "in fact , the trace @xmath6 vanishes for a free gas of massless gluons , being a consequence of conformal invariance of yang - mills theories .",
    "thus , one would expect that @xmath6 vanishes in the high - temeperature limit , where a yang - mills theory is asymptotically free .    in the lattice simulations of refs.millerrev,miller97,miller96 , based on the lattice works of refs .",
    "neew , a striking result was found : the trace of the stress - energy tensor @xmath7 of pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) yang - mills thermodynamics in the deconfining phase does @xmath8 vanish ( and neither decreases ) but @xmath9 linearly with @xmath2 for @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the phase boundary . as emphasized in @xcite",
    ", this result means that the system is strong interacting even at high @xmath2 and puts strong constraints on models aiming at describing these yang - mills theories at finite @xmath2 .",
    "notice that in @xcite a quadratic rise at high @xmath2 ( instead of linear ) of @xmath6 is inferred out of lattice data in the su(3 ) case . on one hand",
    "this difference points to the difficulty in extracting high @xmath2 behavior for thermodynamical quantities , on the other hand it confirms that nonperturative physics is at work in the high temperature domain .",
    "while phenomenological models @xcite predict that , in accord with asymptotic freedom @xcite , the interaction measure @xmath12 vanishes for @xmath13 , there is no general agreement on how fast @xmath14 approaches zero .",
    "namely , as discussed above , not only @xmath14 but the quantity @xmath15 itself should vanish for @xmath13 if the thermodynamical system is described by a noninteracting realtivistic gas of gluons .",
    "notice that in the framework of resummed perturbation theory nonzero contributions to @xmath16 start at order @xmath17 @xcite , where it is shown that @xmath6 keeps growing even for high @xmath18    assuming the correctness of the results of @xcite , it is therefore important to study models which @xmath19 describe the linear growth of @xmath16 in order to understand the origin of this property . in this work we show that within the analytical approach to yang - mills thermodynamics of ref.@xcite the linear growth of @xmath20 is predicted with slopes compatible with lattice results .",
    "this property is a consequence of the presence of a thermal ground state , which takes into account the contributions of calorons ( i.e. instantons at finite @xmath2 ) .",
    "intuitively , this thermal ground state , described by an adjoint - scalar field @xmath21 , represents an @xmath22 over such topologically non - trivial configurations . from a phenomenological perspective",
    "the ground - state contribution to @xmath4 behaves like a temperature dependent bag constant , see for example @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the introduced field @xmath21 generates a higgs mechanism : ( some of ) the gauge modes acquire a temperature - dependent mass , see details in following section .",
    "the ground - state contribution to the pressure @xmath23 is negative ( like the bag pressure is ) and dominates when @xmath24 .",
    "lattice simulations of @xmath5 do not agree on this point .",
    "namely , within the differential method , close to @xmath25 negative pressure is predicted @xcite while the integral method @xcite is designed to generate positive pressure .",
    "however , in the present report we investigate @xmath6 only for @xmath26 , thus well above the phase boundary .    in ref.@xcite a linear growth of @xmath6",
    "was obtained based on the suppression of the infrared modes by invoking a modified dispersion relation of gribov type .",
    "the latter circumvents the well - known problems inherent in a perturbative treatment @xcite . in the alternative approach of @xcite",
    "the stability of the infrared sector is guaranteed by the above mentioned thermal ground state , embodied by an adjoint scalar field @xmath21 , taking into account nontrivial - topology fluctuations .",
    "remarkably , this approach predicts the slopes @xmath27 in @xmath28 once the yang - mills scale @xmath29 ( or alternatively @xmath25 ) is fixed .",
    "the present analysis is not intended to discuss phenomenological fits to lattice curves ( for work in that respect see @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "rather , our goal is to show that the ( asymptotically ) linear growth of @xmath6 is related to the presence of a nontrivial and temperature - dependent ground - state ralfrev , garfield .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we briefly review the approach of ref.@xcite and list expressions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the su(2 ) case .",
    "subsequently , we show numerically and analytically that within this approach @xmath28 for @xmath30 and compare @xmath27 with the results of @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the su(3 ) case and give our conclusions .",
    "_ _  _ _ in ref.@xcite an adjoint scalar field @xmath21 is derived which , upon spatial coarse graining , describes the dynamics of nontrivial , bps - saturated topological configurations @xcite giving rise to an energy density and pressure of the thermal ground state .",
    "the field @xmath21 acts as a background to the dynamics of topologically _ trivial _ fluctuations .",
    "the modulus @xmath31 exhibits a dependence on @xmath2 and on @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding potential is @xmath32 ralfrev , garfield . in unitary gauge",
    "the effective lagrangian describing a thermalized , pure su(2 ) yang - mills system reads : @xmath33 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left ( g_{e}^{a,\\mu \\nu } [ a_{\\mu } ] \\right ) ^{2}+2e^{2}\\left\\vert \\phi \\right\\vert ^{2}\\left ( \\left ( a_{\\mu } ^{1}\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( a_{\\mu } ^{2}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ) + 2\\frac{\\lambda ^{6}}{\\left\\vert \\phi \\right\\vert ^{2}}\\ , ,   \\label{lagfirstord}\\]]where @xmath34 denotes the temperature dependent _ effective _ gauge coupling ( see below ) which enters both into the effective field strength @xmath35 and into the mass @xmath36 for the fields @xmath37 .",
    "one has @xmath38that is a temperature - dependent mass is generated in a nonperturbative fashion by the adjoint - scalar field @xmath39 from the effective lagrangian ( [ lagfirstord ] ) one derives , on the one - loop level ( accurate to about 0.1% @xcite ) , the energy density @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath40 as @xmath41where @xmath42 denotes the sum over the two massive modes .",
    "explicitly we have : @xmath43let us now rewrite the system in terms of dimensionless quantities:@xmath44where the function @xmath45 is introduced for later use . in dependence of the dimensionless temperature",
    "@xmath46 the dimensionless energy density @xmath47 and pressure @xmath48 read:@xmath49@xmath50by virtue of the legendre transformation @xmath51the evolution equation for @xmath45 follows:@xmath52there exits a low - temperature attractor to the evolution described by eq.([ev.e ] ) with a logarithmic pole at the critical temperature @xmath53 @xcite . at @xmath54 the fluctuations @xmath37 decouple thermodynamically .",
    "the effective coupling is given as @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath56 the coupling @xmath57 is constant : @xmath58 .",
    "in fact @xmath59then is a solution to eq.([ev.e ] ) .",
    "this plateau is reached rapidly for increasing @xmath46 , see figures in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the linear rise of @xmath6 within the approach described in the previous section . in therms of dimensionless quantities",
    "one has @xmath61a plot of the quantity @xmath62 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "notice the linear growth .",
    "asymptotically ( @xmath63 ) this linear rise can be shown to hold analytically . to this end",
    "let us consider the function@xmath64for @xmath56 ( i.e. @xmath63 ) we have @xcite : @xmath65as a consequence , the function @xmath66 becomes:@xmath67where eq.([alamdalim ] ) has been used .",
    "thus @xmath68 is approximately constant for @xmath56 . the numerical behavior for the function @xmath66 is plotted in the right panel of fig.[fig-1 ] .",
    "notice that the asymptotic value @xmath69 is practically reached for @xmath70 .    by virtue of eq.([hdef ] ) we have asymptotically ( corresponding to the gray curve in the left panel of fig[fig-1]):@xmath71 it is interesting that @xmath6 splits as @xmath72 where the first summand is the direct contribution of the ground state while the second summand arises from the massive modes @xmath37 .",
    "that is , the mass @xmath73 behaves in such a way that fluctuations generate a linear contribution to @xmath6 at high @xmath2 .",
    "let us now compare our prediction for the slope with lattice results . to this end",
    "we relate the yang - mills scale @xmath29 to the critical temperature @xmath25 as@xmath74where @xmath53 has been used .",
    "then we have asymptotically @xmath75 in the work of @xcite a value of @xmath76gev was used .",
    "thus eq.([slopeff ] ) asymptotically predicts @xmath77 .",
    "notice that according to our approach the slope increases from @xmath78gev@xmath79 to the asymptotic value @xmath80gev@xmath79 for @xmath81@xmath82 .",
    "thus our prediction for the slope is in agreement with that of miller @xcite whose lattice simulation yields @xmath83gev@xmath79 ( read off from his fig.1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a slope of @xmath84gev@xmath79 was obtained for the su(2 ) case which also is in qualitative agreement with our result .",
    "notice that the lattice simulations of @xcite observes a linear behavior of @xmath6 , too .    in fig .",
    "2 we report the ( scaled ) energy density @xmath4 , pressure @xmath5 , and entropy density @xmath85 as functions of temperature .",
    "a detailed comparison of these results with those obtained on the lattice ( for both differential and integral method and for the su(3 ) case ) is carried out in @xcite . while there is good agreement for the entropy density @xmath85 ( for which the ground state is not relevant ) the pressure @xmath5 becomes negative close to the phase boundary in virtue of the negative contribution of the ground state . while this is in qualitative agreement with the result of the differential method , it is not with that of the integral method",
    "this fact , as emphaiszed in the introduction , represents a motivation to perform the present work where lattice results safely above the phase boundary , such as the behavior of @xmath6 at high @xmath2 , are compared with the effective approach under study .",
    "in the su(3 ) case the behavior of @xmath6 is qualitatively similar to the su(2 ) case .",
    "we only report on some relevant formulas and briefly discuss their consequences .",
    "the modulus of the scalar field @xmath21 is exactly the same .",
    "as shown in @xcite out of the eight coarse - grained gauge modes four acquire a mass @xmath86 ( contributing to @xmath4 and @xmath5 by @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) , two a mass @xmath89 ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , and two stay massless ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) . explicitly , we have ( @xmath94 ) : @xmath95@xmath96eq.([tsc ] ) assumes the following form:@xmath97the asymptotic solution to eq.([e.ev3 ] ) reads @xmath98 , and the effective coupling reaches a plateau value of @xmath99 the value for @xmath54 is @xmath100 @xcite where the coupling and all masses diverge .",
    "the function @xmath68 , defined in ( [ hdef ] ) , has an asymptotic value of @xmath101 like in the su(2 ) case .",
    "thus the asymptotically linear behavior @xmath102 holds .",
    "relating @xmath29 to the critical temperature @xmath25 as in eq .",
    "( slope ) , we take into account the su(3)-value @xmath100 .",
    "this yields:@xmath103as in ref.@xcite we set @xmath104gev and thus find @xmath105 for @xmath30 . in @xcite a somewhat smaller slope of @xmath106gev@xmath79 is extracted . in @xcite a slope of @xmath107gev@xmath79 was estimated .",
    "in this paper we studied the high - temperature behavior of the trace of the stress - energy tensor @xmath108 this quantity measures the breaking of scale invariance and vanishes for a relativist gas of free gluons : recent lattice works @xcite show a linear rise for high @xmath2 ( see however also @xcite , where the rise is quadratic ) .",
    "this means that strong interactions still play a decisive role even in the high temperature domain .",
    "theoretical studies should therefore be concerned with the predicted behavior of @xmath6 at high temperatures .",
    "we have shown that the linear growth of @xmath6 for high @xmath2 is an analytic prediction of the approach to yang - mills thermodynamics @xcite , which involves a thermal ground state emerging as an average over instantons at finite @xmath2 .",
    "that is , even in the high-@xmath2 limit the dynamic of these field configurations is important and can be detected by lattice simulations . in both cases , su(2 ) and su(3 )",
    ", we evaluated the slope of @xmath6 and the results @xmath109and @xmath110where @xmath25 is the deconfining temperature , are found for high @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we compared to the lattice results of miller @xcite and to the theoretical work of zwanziger @xcite finding good agreement . in the latter a momentum - dependent , universal modification of the dispersion relation for propagating , fundamental gluon fields , motivated by the reduction of the physical state space a la gribov ,",
    "is introduced . our approach and @xcite share the property of a nonpertrubative gluon mass leading to the linear growth of @xmath6 . however , while in our case the mass is a temperature - dependent coarse grained quantity and the ground state itsself contributes to @xmath111 this is not the case in @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison would be surely interesting but goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we believe that future studies on the high @xmath2 behavior of @xmath112 are therefore very important , both numerically and analytically , in order to confirm the linear growth and to relate it to nonperturbative aspects of yang - mills theories .",
