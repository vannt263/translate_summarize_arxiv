    "it has long been known that gamma - ray - bursts ( grbs ) come in ( at least ) two classes : those typically lasting two seconds or less and having hard prompt emission spectra ( short / hard grbs ) and those lasting typically longer than two seconds and having softer prompt spectra often showing strong hard - to - soft spectral evolution ( long / soft grbs ) @xcite .",
    "the long / soft grbs have been related spectroscopically @xcite to the deaths of massive stars , the so - called collapsar model @xcite ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it was proposed that all long grbs are accompanied by photometric supernova signatures @xcite .",
    "the short / hard grbs have been more enigmatic , as they are rarer and harder to localize .",
    "the most favored model is the merger of two compact objects , i.e. two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole @xcite .    while there have also been extremely intense short / hard grbs , such as grb 841215 @xcite , grb 930131 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and grb 031214 @xcite , the true breakthrough in the observations only came with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite and its discovery of well - localized afterglows in the x - ray band @xcite , as well as the _ hete-2 _ localization of grb 050709 .",
    "these lead to identifications in the optical @xcite and radio @xcite bands , thus allowing for the first time an association between some short / hard grbs and galaxies at moderate redshift that show no evidence of recent star - formation @xcite .",
    "thus , at least some short / hard grbs must stem from a different progenitor class than long / soft grbs , and several lines of evidence favor the compact object merger models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for recent reviews on short",
    "/ hard grbs , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further observations showed that the classic short / hard vs. long / soft dichotomy could not hold .",
    "observations of early , soft , extended emission bumps and late x - ray flares in the afterglows of short / hard grbs @xcite showed that even for compact object mergers , the central engine must be active for much longer time than previously thought .",
    "the situation became even more complex when two temporally long grbs at low redshift were discovered which showed no evidence for accompanying supernovae , grbs 060505 and 060614 @xcite .",
    "grb 060614 , with @xmath0 s , was clearly a long grb but showed @xcite , next to the missing supernova , another clear sign of typical short / hard grbs , negligible spectral lag between different energy bands of the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that it was possible to `` transform '' the prompt emission light curve of grb 060614 into a light curve strongly resembling that of grb 050724 ( short , hard spike , long , faint and soft emission tail ) simply by reducing the luminosity of the grb .",
    "this lead to the idea of a new classification scheme for grbs @xcite : in analogy to type ia and type ii supernovae , grbs can be classified as type i events ( merger - induced , no supernova , can be found in all types of galaxies ) and type ii events ( collapsar - induced , associated with broad - lined type ic supernovae , found only in galaxies with high specific star - formation ) .",
    "this definition is not based on a single observed quantity ( such as the location in a @xmath1hardness diagram ) , and thus it is , in some cases , not possible to clearly state if a grb is of type i or ii .",
    "we will adopt this terminology , and will use several observed indicators to separate the type i and type ii samples . also , we will later point out some shortcomings of the original definition .",
    "for an even more radical approach toward grb classification based on physical progenitor models , see @xcite .    in a companion paper (",
    "* henceforth paper i ) , we compiled optical light curves of _ swift_-era type ii grbs and compared them with those of a pre-_swift _ sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth k06 ) .",
    "we found that the two samples are very similar , and that , intrinsically , the afterglows had comparable luminosities . therefore , it is justified to treat all afterglows as one large , coherent sample . in this work ,",
    "we have compared the type i grb afterglows ( which often only consist of non - detections and thus upper limits ) with this large sample of type ii grbs afterglows .",
    "the type i grb afterglow sample and the selection criteria , as well as the methods for modeling supernova contributions , are described in  [ datai ] . using the method described in k06 , all grb afterglow light curves",
    "have been shifted to a common redshift , allowing a direct comparison of the afterglow luminosities of type ii and type i grbs .",
    "this allowed us to find the luminosity distribution of type i grb afterglows (  [ intrinsic ] ) , place deep upper limits on accompanying supernova emission (  [ sncon ] ) , and put constraints on the parameter space of heavy - element- and neutron - decay driven `` mini - supernovae '' as proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth lp98ab ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth k05 ) (  [ minicon ] ) .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ disc ] .",
    "furthermore , using the derived bolometric energetics of our type i and type ii grb samples , we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emission and the afterglow luminosities derived at a fixed rest - frame time  [ eac ] .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ end ] .    in our calculations we assumed a flat universe with matter density @xmath2 , cosmological constant @xmath3 , and hubble constant @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as has been stated in the introduction , the `` type i and type ii '' nomenclature is based on different observational quantities , not all of which are as easily accessible as @xmath6 , the duration , in the observer frame , during which the grb emits 90% of its fluence , starting after the first 5 % and extending to 95% @xcite . for this paper",
    ", we took a relatively open approach toward the sample selection .",
    "@xcite outline different criteria for deciding whether a grb belongs to the `` merger population '' or the `` collapsar population '' .",
    "taking into account our complete sample , we focused on deciding which grbs are probably type i. any remaining grbs are then part of the type ii sample , without any controversial evidence that they might belong to the merger - population .",
    "most grbs in this paper that are classified as type i grbs also fulfill the `` classical '' @xmath6 definition out of the batse era @xcite .",
    "none of the grbs in the type ii sample in paper i have @xmath7 s , although a few are just beyond the limit ( e.g. , xrf 050416a , which is an x - ray flash and has an associated photometric supernova , * ? ? ?",
    "those that are longer than @xmath8 s have other indicators that put them into the type i class . @xcite propose that a strong indicator for a merger - population event is a negligible spectral lag between different energy bands , i.e. type i grbs do not follow a lag - luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite propose that certain batse grbs that had been classified as `` long '' are indeed type i grbs , consisting of a short ( usually @xmath9 s ) single spike or series of spikes ( the initial pulse complex , ipc ) , followed by a long , usually soft and faint extended soft emission component ( esec ) .",
    "this link was made due to several _ swift _ grbs showing this characteristic light curve shape , with the classic example being grb 050724 , which was a clear type i event due to its association with an old stellar population @xcite . since we expect no or only very little light contribution from the decay of radioactive elements in the light of a type i grb afterglow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , a final criterium is no detected sn emission to very deep limits several weeks after the grb .",
    "grb 060614 is a type i grb according to these criteria , in spite the very long @xmath6 .",
    "grb 060505 , on the other hand , is a very special case , while the sn limits are deeper than for any other grb ( @xmath10 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) , it has recently been shown to have significant spectral lag @xcite .",
    "for reasons detailed later (  [ hybrid ] ) , we will keep it in the type i sample and discuss it in this paper .",
    "details on all grbs in our sample can be found in  [ appa ] , where we also list the sources of the data used in this study .    in summary ,",
    "our selection criteria are :    * @xmath11 s and a hard spectrum with a high peak energy ( `` classical '' short / hard grb definition , we thus do not consider the sometimes short but very soft xrfs ) * and/or an ipc+esec prompt emission shape combined with negligible spectral lag ( we thus do not consider  long  grbs with negligible spectra lag like grb 050717 , * ? ? ? * ) * and/or the lack of a supernova down to deep , late limits for low - redshift events where it is known that dust extinction would not suppress supernova emission ( this includes grb 060505 , grb 060614 is also adressed by the second point )      in almost all cases , no optical afterglows were discovered , so that only upper limits are available , either ground - based or by _ swift _ uvot . in order to maximize the available light curve information for our study , we transformed the data of all filters to the @xmath12 band ( after correcting for the individual foreground extinction for each grb and each filter , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by making the following assumptions : first , we assumed that the intrinsic spectral slope of the optical / nir afterglow of each grb is @xmath13 , unless the data were sufficient to measure it . in the standard fireball model ,",
    "if the cooling frequency @xmath14 lies blueward of the optical bands , it is @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , with the canonical value @xmath16 @xcite , implying @xmath13 . observations of type ii grb afterglows show that this situation has the highest probability ( k06 ) , and the mean and median values of the complete sample of paper i are almost exactly 0.6 . while we caution that it has been shown that @xmath17 is not universal ( k06 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that @xmath14 can also lie redward of the optical bands ( e.g. , the case of grb 060505 ,  [ appa ] ) , our assumption should be valid in the majority of cases .",
    "the influence of a different spectral slope on the shift @xmath18  [ shift ] is dependent on redshift .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath19 , @xmath20 mag between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , it is only @xmath24 mag . for the luminosity distribution ,",
    "these small differences are not critical .",
    "our second assumption is that the observed sed is unaffected by wavelength - dependent extinction through dust in the grb host galaxies . as merger - induced events are typically expected to occur far from star - forming regions ( but see , e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this assumption is reasonable ( see table [ tabtypeisample ] ) .",
    "we caution , however , that one type i grb afterglow sed , that of grb 050709 , seems to show line - of - sight extinction even though the grb is located in the outskirts of its host galaxy @xcite . in those cases where",
    "no afterglow has been detected and we have upper limits only , we choose successively deeper limits , as the afterglows are not expected to rebrighten significantly and follow a typical monotonic decay ( see fig .",
    "[ bigfig1 ] ) .    many type i grbs do not have measured redshifts .",
    "so far , no absorption spectroscopy of a type i grb",
    "afterglow has been successful ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that redshifts can only be determined from host galaxy spectroscopy . in some cases , no galaxies ( or only extremely faint ones )",
    "are found in the _ swift _ xrt error circles , and the grbs are instead assumed to be associated with bright nearby galaxies , such as in the case of grb 050509b @xcite ( localized in the outskirts of a bright elliptical galaxy ) , grb 060502b @xcite and grb 061201 @xcite , or galaxy clusters , as for grb 050911 @xcite .",
    "finally , if no association can be made at all , we choose a redshift @xmath25 , which is the ( rounded ) median value of all measured redshifts we consider secure . in two cases ( grb 051227 and grb 060313 ) ,",
    "we choose @xmath26 , as the host galaxies of these grbs ( localized to subarcsecond precision through their optical afterglows ) are exceedingly faint ( @xmath27 ) and thus resemble the hosts of type ii grbs ( although we caution that we have no detailed information on properties such as star - formation rates etc . ) . in an earlier version of the draft",
    ", we also assumed @xmath26 for grb 070714b , as it shows several similarities to grb 060313 (  [ appa ] ) . in the meantime , the redshift has been measured from host galaxy spectroscopy to be @xmath28 @xcite , very close to our initial estimate .",
    "we caution that while there is evidence that these grbs do not lie much beyond @xmath26 ( e.g. , the detection of the afterglow of grb 060313 in all uvot filters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they may lie significantly closer , with their host galaxies lying at the faint end of an as yet unknown luminosity distribution .      with knowledge of the redshift @xmath29 , the extinction - corrected spectral slope @xmath30 and the host galaxy rest frame extinction @xmath31",
    ", we can use the method described in k06 to shift all type i grb afterglows to a common redshift of @xmath26 , corrected for extinction along the line of sight . as stated in ",
    "[ datai ] , we do not have @xmath30 and @xmath31 for most type i grb afterglows , and in some cases , even @xmath29 is unknown .",
    "thus , on many type i grb afterglows , we can not derive results analogous to the type ii grb afterglows ( paper i ) , but have to view them as an ensemble .",
    "compared with the true but unknown values for the parameters needed for the magnitude shift @xmath18 , the magnitudes or upper limits of some grbs may be fainter or brighter . the effect is stronger for low redshifts , for @xmath19 in comparison to @xmath25 , it is @xmath32 , for @xmath23 in comparison to @xmath25 , it is @xmath33 .",
    "still , in a statistical sense , the effect will not be strong as we expect the true redshifts of the grbs to be distributed relatively evenly around @xmath25 .      using the method described in  [ shift ] ,",
    "we have shifted type i grb afterglow light curves to a redshift of @xmath34 . in most cases ,",
    "the shift to @xmath34 is smaller in @xmath29-space than a shift to @xmath26 , implying a smaller uncertainty through the unknown @xmath30 .",
    "another reason for performing this analysis at @xmath34 and not at @xmath26 is that at the latter redshift , the observer frame @xmath35 band of the supernova template is highly insecure due to strong uv blanketing .",
    "our sample consists of those type i grbs that have a known redshift ( which , in some cases , is derived only from associating the grb with a nearby bright galaxy or a cluster ) and late detections / upper limits : grb 050509b , grb 050709 , grb 050724 , grb 050813 , grb 050906 , grb 051221a , grb 060502b , grb 060505 , grb 060614 ( the latter two being the `` sn - less long grbs '' ) and grb 061201 .",
    "we then compare the detections / upper limits with the template light curve of sn 1998bw @xcite , see @xcite for details of the method and descriptions of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which measure the grb - sn luminosity in units of the luminosity of sn 1998bw at peak and the light curve stretching in comparison to the sn 1998bw light curve , respectively . in our comparison",
    ", we conservatively assume that the late optical emission from the type i grbs is due only to supernova light and there is no contribution from afterglow emission . in the case of deep ( host - galaxy subtracted ) detections , we fit the template to pass through the brighter @xmath38 error bar of the faintest data point , and in the case of an upper limit , we fit the template to pass through the most restrictive upper limit .",
    "as we have no information at all about the stretch factor @xmath37 , we assumed @xmath39 in all cases .",
    "if the stretch factor is smaller than sn 1998bw , such as xrf 060218/sn 2006aj @xcite or the photometric sn bump of xrf 050824 @xcite the luminosity limit typically would be slightly less constraining .",
    "our fitting then results in a value of the luminosity factor @xmath36 , e.g. , @xmath40 implies a supernova that has 0.1 times the peak luminosity of sn 1998bw in the same band at the same redshift .",
    "as there have been no signs of supernova bumps in the light curves of type i grb afterglows , our @xmath36 values can be seen as conservative upper limits on any supernova contribution .",
    "the mini - sn model was introduced by lp98ab as a potential observational consequence following the merger of two compact objects ( ns + ns or ns + bh ) . during the merger , neutron star matter at nuclear densities",
    "can be ejected at subrelativistic velocities , condensing into neutron - rich nuclei which rapidly decay , yielding a similar heating source as classical radioactivity - driven supernovae .    from the numerical point of view",
    "the analytical solutions given in lp98ab are easy to handle and , therefore , we used them in our study",
    ". basically , the lp98ab model depends on three free parameters , the ejected mass @xmath41 which is assumed to be identical to the radiating mass , the expansion velocity @xmath42 of the ejected matter , which is assumed to be independent of time , and the fraction @xmath43 of rest mass energy that is transformed into internal heat of the ejecta .",
    "a more detailed description can be found in  [ appc ] .    lp98ab",
    "considered two cases of decay laws for the heating source , an exponential - law decay and a power - law decay .",
    "they found that in both cases for , e.g. , @xmath43=0.001 bright sne are predicted with bolometric peak luminosities up to @xmath44 erg / s , or even higher .",
    "ten years later , in the _ swift _ era , it has become clear however that such bright sne following short bursts are not seen @xcite .",

    "upper limits are marked with downward pointing triangles connected by straight lines , while detections are squares connected with splines .",
    "all the afterglow data have been corrected for galactic extinction ( which is often small ) and in some cases , the contribution of the host galaxy was subtracted (  [ appa ] ) .",
    "we have labeled only a few special afterglows , as this would otherwise decrease legibility .",
    "it is visible immediately that observationally , the optical afterglows of type i grbs are much fainter than those of type ii grbs .",
    "most optical afterglows are not detected at all , to upper limits that would have clearly detected all type ii grb afterglows in this sample .",
    "this is especially the case for early times ( @xmath45 days ) , where only a few type ii grb afterglows ( e.g. grb 050820a , xrf 050416a , grb 070110 ) are fainter than most limits .",
    "the most constraining upper limits are on grb 050509b , which was observed rapidly by rotse @xcite and raptor @xcite , an upper limit of @xmath46 is found after just 30 seconds .",
    "furthermore , @xcite give an upper limit @xmath47 at only 0.09 days after the grb , almost four magnitudes deeper than needed to detect any type ii grb in the sample of paper i. the faintest type i afterglow in our sample is that of grb 051227 , discovered by the vlt @xcite and seen to decay very rapidly , possibly due to post - jet - break decay .",
    "the only afterglow of a type i grb ( and a controversial one at that ) that is comparable to the typical type ii grb afterglows is that of grb 060614 @xcite .",

    "for the complete type i grb afterglow sample ( detections and upper limits , but without grb 060121 ) , the variance is at least 3.6 magnitudes .",

    ", the afterglow of grb 060614 , by far the brightest observed type i grb afterglow , is half a magnitude fainter than the afterglow of grb 070419a ( paper i ) , and then it becomes even fainter rapidly .",
    "assuming the association with a galaxy at @xmath52 @xcite , the afterglow of grb 061201 has a magnitude of @xmath53 just a few minutes after the grb , which is about 11 magnitudes fainter than the typical early type ii grb afterglows .",

    "it is thus clearly not a classical type ii grb , but also not of the subluminous type ii family , such as grb 980425 @xcite , grb 031203 @xcite and xrf 060218 @xcite , as these grbs , while possessing very faint afterglows , were also accompanied by energetic supernovae .",

    "almost all other type i grbs with redshifts are closer than this , so it is more likely that the true redshifts of these two grbs will be @xmath56 than @xmath57 , making their absolute magnitudes even fainter and the strong bimodality of type i and type ii grb afterglows even more secure .",
    "also , we note that one of the type ii grb afterglow samples of paper i , the `` bronze sample '' , is not corrected for host extinction , as sed information was lacking .",
    "therefore , the luminosities of those afterglows are lower limits , any extinction correction would make them brighter , which would also strengthen the bimodality .",

    "the limits for grb 060502b and grb 061201 stated here are derived for the first time in this paper .",
    "this compilation further substantiates the observation that type i grbs are not associated with the deaths of massive stars and their accompanying supernovae and must derive from progenitors that produce only very small amounts of @xmath61ni , such as the mergers of compact objects .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , there must exist a broad gap in peak luminosity between these faint sne ( if they exist at all ) and the traditional sne associated with type ii grbs .",
    "it must be stressed that only in two cases detections of the optical transient at the time of the suspected sn maximum at @xmath64 days have been reported in the literature ( for grb 050709 and grb 060614 ; even though , after host subtraction , with a large error bar for the latter ) , but no late - time follow - up observations weeks after the suspected sn peak have been published so far .",
    "this leaves open the question if this positive detection was the late afterglow light or in fact an underlying faint sn component , even though the error bar is small enough for grb 050709 only to tackle this question seriously . in all other cases",
    "only upper limits are available at the suspected sn maximum around @xmath65 days after the corresponding burst , if at all",
    ".    clearly , the upper limits we can set will be misleading if the light curve evolution of any kind of a sn following a type i event differs substantially from the one of grb - sne of type ii bursts , i.e. with respect to peak time and stretch factor .",
    "this brings us to the mini - sn model .",
    "we first consider the power - law decay model , which was considered by lp98ab as the most likely case .",
    "lp98ab demonstrated that , depending on the chosen model parameters , a mini - sne can peak at much earlier times than a normal core - collapse supernova . therefore , given the currently available data base ( fig .",
    "[ snfig ] ) , one has to distinguish between those type i grbs with and those without detected early afterglow light .",
    "for example , a relatively bright mini - sn peaking at , say , @xmath12=22 about 0.5 days after the burst could have been escaped detection in the early light curve of the afterglow of grb 051221a .",
    "faint mini - sne could also be underlying the afterglow light curves of grb 050709 and grb 060614 without being recognized because of lack of spectral information .",
    "much tighter constraints can be set for those type i grbs with deep upper limits .",
    "figure [ bigfig2 ] shows that up to about 2 weeks after the event , the observed upper limits on any optical afterglow following grb 050509b are the deepest limits for any type i grb obtained so far .",
    "in addition , the very likely association of grb 050509b with a giant elliptical galaxy @xcite and the offset from this host makes it unlikely that the faintness of the afterglow / mini - sn was due to internal extinction in the host galaxy . for this burst ,",

    "[ snfig ] ) .",
    "figure  [ lipa ] shows the allowed parameter space ( @xmath67 ) ( see  [ mini ] for the definitions of these quantities ) for any mini - sn following grb 050509b , assuming an expansion velocity of @xmath68 ( following lp98ab ) and a matter opacity identical to thomson scattering .",
    "if , within this model , log @xmath43 lies somewhere between @xmath693 and @xmath695 then for this event the ejected mass must have been less than 0.001 @xmath63 .",
    "k05 discussed in detail the model of an explosion where the decay of free neutrons is the internal heating source .",
    "moreover , by adding the contribution of the thermal pressure to the equation describing the expansion of the ejected envelope , k05 generalized in some way lp98ab s approach . unfortunately , no analytic solution is then known .",
    "following k05 we assumed that the energy source decays according to an exponential law with a half life time of 10.4 min but we fixed @xmath70 .",
    "the evolution of the neutron - rich ejecta is then photon pressure dominated so that the analytic solutions given in lp98b ( their eq .",

    "the ejecta is usually very hot ( @xmath72 k ) at the time of the peak of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the luminosity in the optical bands then peaks at later time ( see also k05 , their figures 5 and 6 ) , usually around 1 day . unfortunately , for small ejected masses the envelope becomes rapidly optically thin so that our approach to calculate the optical luminosity via the assumption of black body radiation ( see  [ appc ] concerning the method ) becomes less secure in such cases .",

    "this constraint on @xmath41 is still in the lower range of the results obtained by numerical studies of neutron star mergers ( cf .",
    "several years before the first detection of a type i grb afterglow , @xcite predicted that the discovery and follow - up of type i grb afterglows would be a big observational challenge .",
    "based on the observational fact that typical type i grbs show a fluence more than an order of magnitude smaller than typical type ii grbs , they predicted that the afterglows should be 10 to 40 times fainter , with radio afterglows hardly detectable and x - ray afterglows giving the best chance for detection .",
    "furthermore , a low density external medium , as might be expected from merger progenitor models , would further complicate the chances for follow - up , as would less collimated jets . basically , their predictions have been observationally confirmed .",
    "we have shown , however , that the factor is around 100 , not only 10 to 40 .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy is that many _ swift_-detected type i grbs have up to orders of magnitude less isotropic energy release than the @xmath75 erg @xcite used in their modeling .",
    "the additional detrimental effects of low density external media ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and large jet opening angles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the circumburst medium is expected to have a constant density . with typical parameters ,",
    "the optical band should satisfy @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath14 are the minimum injection synchrotron frequency and cooling frequency of relativistic electrons , respectively .",
    "the optical afterglow flux density in this regime is @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79^{(p-1)}$ ] @xcite .",
    "other notations follow the convention of the standard afterglow model : @xmath80 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the blastwave , @xmath81 is the circumburst medium density , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the fractions of the shock internal energy carried by electrons and magnetic fields , respectively , @xmath17 is the spectral index of the relativistic electrons , and @xmath84 is the luminosity distance of the burst .",
    "the fainter afterglows of type i grbs are due to the combination of a lower fluence and a lower energy density as expected for the merger scenarios @xcite .",
    "the derivation of @xcite was based on two assumptions : type i grbs have similar radiative efficiency as type ii grbs , and @xmath80 of type i grbs is on average 20 times smaller than that of type ii grbs . with the recent observations of type i grbs ,",
    "it is clear that the first assumption holds , i.e. for a sample of type i grbs studied , the radiative efficiency is not very different from that of type ii grbs @xcite .",
    "however , the second assumption , which was based on the fact that type i grbs have a @xmath85 times smaller fluence than type ii grbs and the implicit assumption that both populations have a similar mean redshift , is no longer justified .",
    "it is now known that a large fraction of type i grbs are nearby , so that they are less energetic than previously expected , i.e. @xmath80 is more like 100 times smaller than that of type ii grbs . leaving out the @xmath86 factor in eq.([fnu ] ) which takes account for the fluence factor discussed by @xcite , there is an additional @xmath87 dependence .",
    "this accounts for another factor of @xmath88 reduction of type i grb flux ( assuming a typical value of @xmath89 ) with respect to the estimate of @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the results presented in this paper . in some cases , an even lower density @xmath81 ( to be consistent with the intergalactic medium outside the host galaxy - as expected to happen for some short grbs with large kick velocities )",
    "is needed to account for the faintness of the afterglows @xcite .",
    "the larger spread of @xmath90 for type i grbs than type ii grbs is less straightforwardly interpreted .",
    "both types of grbs should follow the same parameter dependences as shown in eq.([fnu ] ) .",
    "one has to argue that the scatter of the parameters is larger for type i grbs than type ii grbs .",
    "one factor of @xmath90 scatter is due to that of @xmath91 ( with a dependence of @xmath92 ) .",
    "the high-@xmath29 type i grb 060121 is an example that has a much larger @xmath91 than its low-@xmath29 brethren .",
    "it may be highly collimated @xcite , or may be related to a different progenitor from most other type i grbs . a second factor that causes the larger scatter of @xmath90 for type",
    "i grbs is the circumburst medium @xmath81 ( with a dependence @xmath93 ) .",
    "since merger events can happen in all types of galaxies and either inside and outside the hosts , as suggested by the data , the ambient density could have a large scatter . while mergers inside star - forming galaxies may have a medium density comparable to that of type ii grbs ,",
    "those events outside the hosts ( due to large kicks received during the births of one or two neutron stars in the system ) could have a tenuous medium , which tends to give rise to a `` naked '' burst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility that leads to a low density circumburst medium and a large offset without the need for high kick velocities are mergers in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "a more speculative possibility is the scatter of shock parameters . while for type ii grbs @xmath83",
    "may be mainly determined by the post - shock instabilities that generate the in - situ fields @xcite , the existence of a pulsar wind bubble ( for reviews , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) before the merger events would introduce a background magnetic field which would be compressed by the shock to power synchrotron emission ( for grbs and pulsar wind nebulae , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this extra complication may introduce a larger scatter of @xmath83 and hence @xmath90 ( with a dependence @xmath94 ) .",
    "but the existence of such a bubble can be ruled out for all but the youngest merging systems , which are expected to make up only a small part of the population ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ) .",
    "classical sn 1998bw light with its peak around @xmath95 days after a burst is still the clearest signature of a type ii event .",
    "type i events , on the other hand , should not have such a pronounced sn signal and in fact it has never been found .",
    "the deepest limit obtained so far for a potential sn 1998bw component that followed a burst is for grb 060505 with @xmath96 .",
    "as it has already been shown by lp98ab and k05 , getting very deep upper limits between around some hours and 1 days after a short burst might provide the strongest constraints on extra light related to the ejecta from merging compact objects .",
    "for example , for certain models discussed here the current data set , given by the upper limits on an optical transient following grb 050509b , already excludes a mass ejection of more than about 0.001 solar masses .",
    "unfortunately , since the peak luminosity is proportional to @xmath97 ( lp98a , their eq .",
    "13 ) getting deeper flux limits basically means setting tighter constraints on @xmath43 and not so much on @xmath41 .    given the very small signal strength we potentially might expect from a mini - sn or macronova , observing in white light ,",
    "i.e. unfiltered , is perhaps the very best strategy at first . since short bursts related to elliptical host galaxies",
    "are the best candidates for having faint afterglows , any additional signal might be best detectable or constrained in these cases .",
    "additional strong constraints on decay - driven light in type i grb optical transients would come from spectroscopy or broadband optical / nir photometry .",
    "this would allow the detection of a component in the transient light that deviates from the expected afterglow synchrotron spectrum ( which may be additionally affected by dust ) , or allow the placement of upper limits thereon .",
    "acquiring such spectroscopy will be challenging , though .",
    "thus far , only three type i grbs have had their afterglows detected within the first minutes after the grb ( grb 060313 , grb 061201 and grb 070714b ) , and in all cases , the early evolution was flat and the afterglow was fainter than 20th magnitude upon discovery .",
    "only grb 060614 , for which the identification as a type i grb remains questionable , had an afterglow which was bright enough at observation time to allow 8m - class telescopes to obtain high s / n spectroscopy .",
    "this case illustrates a second quandary concerning the spectroscopy of type i grb afterglows , and the identification of absorption lines and thus unambiguous redshifts .",
    "the first spectrum of the afterglow of grb 060614 contained no lines in emission or absorption @xcite , and a redshift could only be determined after the afterglow had faded enough to allow host galaxy emission lines to be detected @xcite .",
    "even so , the association with the galaxy is somewhat controversial @xcite due to the quite large offset from its host galaxy in terms of half - light radius or brightest pixel distribution @xcite , but this is based on _ a posteriori _ statistics , @xcite use hst imaging to determine a very low probability ( @xmath98 ) of a chance association .",
    "indeed , it is this offset , and the associated low - density medium surrounding the progenitor , which is probably the source of the low column densities of any absorption lines .",
    "this may turn out to be a serious problem for the determination of absorption line redshifts , as the typical observed magnitudes of type i grb afterglows preclude the use of echelle spectroscopy , which is a better tool to detect low column density absorption lines .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the first successful ( i.e. , high continuum s / n ) spectroscopy of a type i grb afterglow will probably not yield usable absorption lines that allow a redshift determination .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently reported that spectroscopy of the afterglow of grb 061201 revealed neither absorption nor emission lines , but pointing constraints limited the exposure time to one hour , and the s / n is low .",
    "our unique sample of type i and type ii grb afterglow luminosities allows us to look for correlations between different parameters . to achieve a comparison with the energies of the grbs",
    ", we compile the fluences and band function ( or cut - off power law ) parameters for our type i grb sample ( table [ tabtypeisample ] ) and add these parameters for the type ii grb sample ( paper i ) . in total , our sample encompasses 30 type i grb events and 58 type ii grb events . using the given spectral parameters and the redshifts",
    ", we derive @xmath36-corrections for the rest - frame bolometric bandpass of 1 to 10000 kev following the method of @xcite . using the bolometric correction , the fluences and the luminosity distances",
    ", we then derive the bolometric isotropic energy @xmath99 for all grbs .",
    "the plot of bolometric isotropic energy release ( table [ tabtypeisample ] ) versus the flux density of the afterglow at one day after the grb assuming @xmath26 ( converted from table [ tabtypei ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ mageiso ] .",
    "this is an expansion of figure 7 in paper i. we differentiate between five data sets .",
    "all type ii grb afterglows have detections and a secure redshift . in the case of type",
    "i grb afterglows , we differentiate between detected afterglows and upper limits , and between secure and insecure redshifts .",
    "taking the complete data set , there is a clear trend visible .",
    "grbs with larger isotropic energy output tend to have brighter optical afterglows at a fixed late time after the grb , when possible additional early emission processes like reverse shock flashes contribute only negligibly .",
    "this trend is very similar to the one found by @xcite , who compared the isotropic energies ( without performing a @xmath36-correction ) with the x - ray luminosities at a fixed datum , and it confirms the trend already seen in the type ii grb afterglows alone ( paper i ) . at first glance ,",
    "the type i and type ii samples form a homogeneous sample , with the brightest and most powerful type i grbs ( e.g. , grb 060121 , grb 060313 , grb 070714b ) overlapping with the faintest type ii grbs ( e.g. , grb 060512 , xrf 050416a , grb 070419a , see paper i ) .",
    "the type ii grb afterglows have a very large scatter , e.g , the spread around @xmath100 erg is almost a factor of 40 ( four magnitudes ) , and in most cases , the errors on the flux density of the optical afterglows are very small . without several low - luminosity events such as those mentioned before , no trend would be visible at all ( paper i ) .",
    "this large scatter is probably due to several underlying causes , with the diverse jet opening angles probably having the strongest impact .",
    "a large spread of circumburst densities may also play a role .",
    "an unweighted linear fit to the type i grb afterglows with detections and secure redshifts shows that while the slope is similar ( from linear fits to the logarithmic quantities , we find slopes of 0.36 and 0.38 for type ii and type i afterglows , respectively ) , the normalization is different . at @xmath101 erg ,",
    "the difference in flux density is a factor @xmath102 ; and @xmath103 at @xmath104 erg , where the two data clouds overlap . as discussed before , assuming the radiative efficiencies and blastwave physics to be similar for both central engine types ( also , the jet opening angle distribution needs to be similar , it is as yet unclear if this is the case ) , this is an indication that the typical circumburst density around type i grb progenitors is lower than for collapsar - induced grbs .",
    "as the normalization difference is @xmath93 , this implies that the typical ambient density around type i grb progenitors is roughly a factor of @xmath105 less , albeit with very large error margins ( the range of 10 to several 1000 ) .",
    "still , a spread of efficiencies is possible ( for a detailed analysis , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may also induce the large scatter in the type ii sample . finally , since many type i grbs only have upper limits on the optical luminosity , the reduced scatter that seems to be visible in fig [ mageiso ] is probably not real",
    "we also plot the effect of an unknown redshift . here , we use grb 060313 as an example , since it has a well - determined prompt emission spectrum and a well - observed afterglow too .",
    "we determine the isotropic bolometric energy release assuming the grb actually lies at @xmath106 and 2.0 , as well as the magnitude shift @xmath18 for these redshifts ( ignoring the fact that uvot detections in all bands imply @xmath107 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then use the shifted light curve to determine the flux density at one day assuming @xmath26 .",
    "the results are shown as data points connected by a spline .",
    "they rise more rapidly than the slope of the correlations , implying that an unknown redshift will have a significant effect on the scatter and on the fit results if one were to add these additional grbs .",
    "figure [ magoffset ] shows the afterglow magnitude of type i grbs ( the same data as in fig . [ mageiso ] )",
    "plotted against the offset from their host galaxy .",
    "once again , we differentiate between detections and upper limits and secure and insecure redshifts .",
    "if we concentrate on the secure redshifts only , a clear trend emerges , with larger offsets implying fainter magnitudes .",
    "this trend once again indicates the probable effect of the density of the circumburst medium on the kinetic energy conversion efficiency and thus the afterglow magnitude . for the cases with insecure redshift ,",
    "the scatter is much larger , with grb 051227 ( faint afterglow centered on the host ) and the high - redshift solution of grb 060121 ( extremely bright afterglow with a moderate host offset ) being the strongest outliers .",
    "again , we use grb 060313 to analyze the effect of an unknown redshift .",
    "the derived track is roughly perpendicular to the trend mentioned above , implying a strong dependency on redshift .",
    "the track of grb 060313 crosses the trend at roughly @xmath108 .",
    "interestingly enough , the @xmath51 solution of grb 060121 is quite close in both afterglow magnitude and host offset to grb 060313 at a similar redshift , at first glance implying a similar track for grb 060121 and a naive `` prediction '' of a redshift around @xmath108 .",
    "independent of the validity of the trend as a rough redshift indicator , the track for grb 060121 would be different , though , as the red afterglow would imply a strong extinction correction at such a low redshift @xcite , which would correct the afterglow magnitude up again ( no extinction correction has been assumed for grb 060313 ) .",
    "@xcite researched a possible correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath109 , and found tentative evidence for a correlation between the two parameters . with our larger sample",
    ", we repeat this analysis .",
    "we correct the @xmath6 times for the redshift .",
    "a more correct approach would need to involve the modeling of detector thresholds and a temporally resolved spectral analysis of the prompt emission to determine which parts would still be detectable at different redshifts .",
    "this is especially important for the esec component , which typically has both a very low peak flux as well as soft emission , and thus rapidly becomes undetectable with rising redshift . ] , and , in contrast to @xcite , our isotropic energies are bolometric . in the case of grbs which have an extended soft emission component ( esec ) , we separate this total @xmath6 from the duration of the initial pulse complex ( ipc ) only , which is shorter than 5 seconds in all cases . fig .",
    "[ t90eiso ] shows the plotted data . disregarding the @xmath6 values which include an esec",

    "we once more use grb 060313 to derive a redshift track .",
    "again , this grb is very suited for this analysis , as it was exceedingly bright and had the highest ( lower limit ) ratio of ipc to esec emission @xcite , therefore our naive @xmath6 transformation with redshift is expected to be adequate . similar to the effect of an unknown redshift on host galaxy offset ( fig .",
    "[ magoffset ] ) , the track is roughly vertical to the trend seen in fig .",
    "[ t90eiso ] and thus redshift uncertainty may strongly contribute to scatter .",
    "in this case , grb 060313 agrees with the values of other grbs only for low redshifts @xmath110 .",
    "if a redshift @xmath111 is confirmed spectroscopically , it will be a strong outlier in this plot , indicating the lack of a true correlation .",
    "we also compared the @xmath6 with the host galaxy offset .",
    "we find marginal evidence that type i grbs with an esec ( i.e. , large @xmath6 ) typically have a smaller host galaxy offset than grbs that consist of an ipc only .",
    "this result was independently discovered by @xcite , and we refer to this paper for a deeper analysis and discussion on why this may indicate two different progenitor types .      in fig .",
    "[ mbz ] , we plot the absolute magnitude @xmath112 of all type i and type ii grbs in our sample over the redshift of the grbs . there is clearly a `` zone of avoidance '' in the lower right corner .",
    "if we plot the constant observer frame luminosity @xmath113 ( with the normalization constant @xmath114 in this case ) , shown as a dashed line , it becomes clear that this effect is due to the optical detector threshold , in this case the limiting magnitude that the telescopes used for observations can reach .",
    "this is similar to the detector threshold bias in high energy observations @xcite .",
    "another point , different from detector thresholds , is how much effort is ( can be ) actually invested into obtaining deep observations .",
    "grb 050509b is a good example , being the first well - localized type i grb , it triggered an unprecedented observing campaign , yielding very deep early limits ( fig .",
    "[ bigfig1 ] ) .",
    "another strong bias in the case of type ii grb afterglows comes from the sample selection criteria , especially the need for a spectroscopic redshift , which favors afterglows that are bright in the observer frame ( k06 , paper i ) . for type",
    "i grbs , this bias is reduced , as all redshifts have been derived from host galaxy spectroscopy , but here , the need for ( at least ) an x - ray afterglow detection to determine the host identification with sufficient significance yields a similar effect .",

    "this afterglow was only discovered due to very deep observations with 8 m class telescopes @xcite . in this case , the redshift assumption is almost irrelevant , as changing the redshift will move the data point more or less parallel to the threshold line .",

    ", this event has become of crucial importance . in light of all data on this grb , one of two `` gold indicators '' of progenitor affiliation must be incorrect in at least some cases .",
    "either not all merger population grbs show negligible spectral lag , or not all collapsar population grbs show a supernova component .",

    "the fact that the grb does not obey the amati relation @xcite is also not a strong indication of this being a type i event , as several clear collapsar events ( grb 980425 , grb 031203 ) are also not in accordance with the amati relation .",
    "the one strong argument for this being a type ii grb is the significant spectral lag , and the one strong argument for this being a type i grb is the deepest non - detection of a supernova in a grb afterglow light curve ever .    from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", there is no compelling reason for type i grbs to have negligible spectral lag . @xcite and",
    "@xcite interpret the lag - luminosity correlation @xcite as a kinematic effect , dependent on the viewing angle from which we see the jet and on the lorentz factor .",
    "one may now speculate that the jets of type i grbs have higher lorentz factors , and thus smaller lags , as they propagate into a cleaner environment , since they do not have to penetrate a heavy stellar envelope and are thus less affected by baryon loading .",
    "a test of this hypothesis awaits the measurement of the lorentz factors of type i grb jets , something that is non - trivial even for the much brighter afterglows of type ii grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . concerning a missing sn component ,",
    "we have already pointed out that several authors have proposed the `` fallback black hole '' scenario which results in a grb without an accompanying supernova @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that grb - producing relativistic jets can be launched with negligible ni@xmath61 production , leading to the absence of supernova emission .",
    "but it seems that such events must be either rare or usually very subluminous , thus evading detection .    from the afterglow luminosity perspective , in retrospect",
    ", we have discussed this grb within the type i sample , as it shows an intrinsically extremely faint afterglow that is as much an outlier in comparison to the type ii grb afterglows as grb 060121 is an outlier compared to the type i grb afterglows .",
    "if this truly is a type ii event , we are left with a uniquely subluminous grb , one that is faint in the prompt emission , in the afterglow _ and _ in the supernova emission , the latter implying that only a small amount of energy is deposited in the subrelativistic ejecta too , in strong contrast to the other subluminous local universe events .",
    "therefore , if the progenitor is of similar mass as a typical type ii grb collapsar , most of the kinetic and rest mass energy of the collapsing core must fall rapidly without significant emission through the event horizon of the central engine .",
    "we have compiled a complete set of optical / nir photometry of _ swift_-era type i grb afterglows , both detections and upper limits , creating a total sample of 31 grbs , considering events up to the end of november 2007 . using the methods of @xcite and k06 , and assuming reasonable values in cases where parameters like the redshift and the spectral slope are unknown , we analyzed the light curves and derived the luminosity distribution of the optical afterglows of type i grbs .",
    "furthermore , we collected data on the energetics , and other prompt emission parameters , of the grbs , as well as host galaxy offsets . with this sample",
    ", we are able , for the first time , to compare the parameter spaces of type i grbs to those of type ii grbs from the sample of paper i ( both pre-_swift _ and _ swift _ grbs ) , both in terms of optical luminosity as well as in terms of energetics .",
    "to summarize , we come to the following results .",
    "* observationally , the optical afterglows of type i grbs are significantly fainter than those of type ii grbs .",
    "many type i grbs do not have any optical detections at all , and often these non - detections reach upper limits much deeper than the magnitudes of our ( biased ) type ii grb afterglow sample at similar times .",
    "type ii grbs not detected to similar depths are usually dark grbs .",
    "* the luminosity distribution of type i grb afterglows shows a larger scatter than for type ii grbs , which have been found to cluster in luminosity space .",
    "the fact that many type i grbs have upper limits on their optical afterglows only implies that the luminosity distribution is even broader than we find . with few exceptions ,",
    "the results for assumed redshifts agree with those for grbs with redshifts we consider secure , implying that our assumptions were not too far off the mark .",
    "we find that the afterglows of type i grbs are , in the mean , five magnitudes fainter than those of type ii grbs .",
    "this is further support that type i and type ii grbs have different progenitors , exploding in different environments .",
    "* we find no evidence for the existence of radioactive - decay - driven supernova emission in the light curves of type i grb afterglows , confirming earlier studies , and adding several more examples of strong upper limits .",
    "* we research the parameter space of li & paczyski mini - sne , driven both by the decay of radioactive elements as well as neutrons , and strongly rule out the brightest emission models . * using our knowledge of the energetics and typical afterglow luminosities of type i grbs ,",
    "we explore theoretically why their afterglows are even fainter than predicted by @xcite . * in paper",
    "i , we found a very tentative correlation , with a large degree of scatter , between the isotropic bolometric energy release and the afterglow luminosity at a fixed late time .",
    "the type i grb results extend this correlation to smaller energies and lower luminosities .",
    "we find a different normalization of the fit , which can be explained by a strong difference in the density of the external medium into which the jets propagate . *",
    "another trend that confirms expectations is found between the host galaxy offset and the afterglow luminosity .",
    "if confirmed by more data , it may be used as a rough redshift indicator . * a trend between the duration and the isotropic energy release",
    "is not detected in a significant way .",
    "* we discuss three anomalous grbs , which have been assumed to be type i grbs , in the light of the results on their optical luminosities . 1 .",
    "grb 060121 is found to resemble type ii grbs much more than type i grbs , but would then have an extremely short prompt emission spike .",
    "2 .   grb 060614 , notwithstanding its extreme duration , is in good agreement with the upper end of the type i grb distribution in terms of energetics and afterglow luminosity , and thus seems to represent an extreme case of an extended soft emission component .",
    "grb 060505 remains a puzzling object .",
    "the recent measurement of a significant spectral lag by @xcite would place it with the type ii grbs ( in agreement with the environment ) , whereas the total lack of a supernova and the very low optical afterglow luminosity we derive are more akin to type i grbs .",
    "we pose the question if the existence of significant spectral lag truly is a surefire indication that a grb is a type ii event .",
    "one of the main results of paper i was that the afterglows of pre-_swift _ and _ swift _ type ii grbs are , all in all , very similar to each other . here",
    ", we clearly find that this is not the case for type ii and type i grb afterglows , the latter are much less luminous .",
    "the number of detected afterglows as well as the density of the follow - up observations is still too small to derive if the light curve evolution is also significantly different .",
    "more than a decade has passed since the afterglow era began , but for a long time , it was the type ii grb afterglow era only .",
    "the type i grb afterglow era is only three years old , and this study can only be a first exploration into a research area that is just now becoming accessible to us , thanks to an ever - evolving follow - up technology which allows us to be there faster , more precise and deeper all the time . and only a much larger sample will tell where exactly peculiar `` hybrid indicator '' grbs are to be found in the ever - expanding zoo that is the grb parameter space .",

    "<S> , we find that those of type i grbs have a lower average luminosity and show a larger intrinsic spread of luminosities . from late and deep upper limits on the optical transients , </S>",
    "<S> we establish limits on the maximum optical luminosity of any associated supernova , confirming older works and adding new results . </S>",
    "<S> we use deep upper limits on type i grb optical afterglows to constrain the parameter space of possible mini - sn emission associated with a compact - object merger . using the prompt emission data , we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emission and the late optical afterglow luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we find trends between the bolometric isotropic energy release and the optical afterglow luminosity at a fixed time after trigger , and between the host offset and the luminosity , bit no significant trend between the isotropic energy release and the duration of the grbs . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss three anomalous grbs , grb 060121 , grb 060505 , and grb 060614 , in the light of their optical afterglow luminosities . </S>"
