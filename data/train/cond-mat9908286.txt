    "the _ fluctuation theorem _ refers collectively to a number of theoretical results in the field of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , which are striking because they are valid _ far _ from thermal equilibrium .",
    "following the original numerical discovery by evans , cohen , and morriss@xcite , a _ transient _ fluctuation theorem ( applicable to systems driven away from an initial state of equilibrium ) , and a _ steady - state _ fluctuation theorem ( for systems in a nonequilibrium steady state ) , were derived by evans and searles@xcite , and by gallavotti and cohen@xcite , respectively , for systems evolving under deterministic but non - hamiltonian equations of motion .",
    "these results have stimulated considerable research@xcite , in which the fluctuation theorem has been generalized ( in particular to stochastic evolution ) and related to linear response theory , specific examples have been studied , and the relation between the transient and steady - state fluctuation theorems has been discussed .",
    "the steady - state version of the fluctuation theorem can be written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath2 is the probability distribution of observing an average entropy production rate @xmath3 over a time interval of length @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution is defined with respect to an ensemble of trajectory segments of duration @xmath4 , sampled while the system in question evolves in a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "physically , maintaining a system in a nonequilibrium steady state requires the participation of one or more heat reservoirs , for instance to absorb the heat generated by shear forces , or to maintain boundaries of the system at different temperatures .",
    "derivations of the fluctuation theorem which have appeared in the literature ( whether pertaining to systems driven away from equilibrium , or to those in a nonequilbrium steady state ) have discussed a variety of thermostating schemes , both deterministic@xcite and stochastic@xcite , to model the presence of reservoirs .",
    "many of these schemes originated as numerical strategies for simulating the microscopic evolution of a system in thermal contact with a heat reservoir , without simulating the huge number of degrees of freedom making up the reservoir itself .",
    "the very fact that the fluctuation theorem seems to be independent of the thermostating scheme lends it considerable support .",
    "indeed , maes@xcite has argued on quite general grounds that the fluctuation theorem can be understood as a gibbs property of space - time histories ; see also ref.@xcite for illustrative examples .",
    "recently , crooks@xcite has shown that the fluctuation theorem is closely related to another set of results@xcite  also valid far from equilibrium  which relate the free energy difference between two equilibrium states of a system , to the external work performed on the system during a _",
    "non_equilibrium process from one state to the other .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive a result similar to the fluctuation theorem , _ by explicitly including the degrees of freedom of heat reservoirs in the analysis _ , and assuming hamiltonian evolution at the microscopic level .",
    "this approach corresponds closely to the situation present in a laboratory experiment , where the `` thermostating '' is precisely the result of interactions between the system and the innumerable degrees of freedom which constitute its environment .",
    "we will argue that , when all microscopic degrees of freedom are taken into account , then there emerges a `` detailed fluctuation theorem '' ( eq.[eq : central ] below ) , valid for finite times @xmath4 , and expressed without reference to steady states .    a hamiltonian treatment of nonequilibrium processes , similar in spirit to that taken here , was carried out by bochkov and kuzovlev@xcite ( though with less emphasis on a distinction between the `` system of interest '' and its `` environment '' ) .",
    "the central result derived below , however , is new , as is the connection to the fluctuation theorem .",
    "more recently , eckmann , pillet , and rey - bellet@xcite have introduced and studied an exactly solvable , hamiltonian model of a system ( a chain of nonlinear oscillators ) coupled to two heat reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "it would be very interesting to establish the precise relation between the results which they obtain for their model  especially in connection with the nonequilibrium steady state  and the approach taken in section [ sec : ft ] of the present paper .    in the following two sections ,",
    "the central result is stated and derived .",
    "while this result does not explicitly refer to a nonequilibrium steady state , we argue in section [ sec : ft ] that , under appropriate circumstances , it leads to the steady - state fluctuation theorem . in section [ sec :",
    "fe ] we show that the nonequilibrium free energy relation of refs.@xcite also follows from the central result of the present paper .",
    "we end with a discussion in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "suppose we have the following ingredients at our disposal :    1 .   a finite , classical _ system of interest _ ,",
    "@xmath5 , 2 .   a number of _ heat reservoirs _ , @xmath6 , 3 .   and , possibly , a _ work parameter _ , @xmath7 .",
    "the work parameter is some degree of freedom which we control externally , for instance an external field , and which interacts directly with @xmath5 ( but not with the reservoirs ) .",
    "the reservoirs are also finite , classical systems , prepared ahead of time at various temperatures . we suppose that we can establish or break thermal contact between our system of interest and any of the reservoirs , as we choose . finally , we assume that , at the most fundamental level of description , the system and reservoirs are composed of a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom , and that the collection of these obeys hamiltonian evolution .    our ability to directly manipulate @xmath7 , and to make or break contact with the reservoirs , allows us to subject our system of interest to a variety of thermodynamic processes .",
    "we will take the word _",
    "process _ to be synonymous with an explicit prescription spelling out `` what we do to the system '' at the macroscopic level , using the tools at our disposal ( the work parameter and heat reservoirs ) .",
    "more precisely , a process @xmath8 is defined by a set of instructions specifying :    1 .   the temperatures ( @xmath9 ) at which to prepare the reservoirs , 2 .   when to establish and/or break thermal contact between @xmath5 and any of the @xmath10 s , and 3 .",
    "the time - dependence of the work parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "we will refer to items 2 and 3 as the _ protocol_. we will restrict ourselves to processes occurring over a finite interval of time , @xmath12 $ ] , and will say that a process is _ static _ if the work parameter and thermal contacts are constant over the course of the process . note that a process is defined without reference to the preparation of the system of interest itself .",
    "having introduced the notion of a process to specify `` what we do to @xmath5 '' at the macroscopic level , let us now turn our attention to the microscopic response of the system of interest and reservoirs .",
    "a complete description of this response is provided by a trajectory @xmath13 , detailing the ( hamiltonian ) evolution of all participating degrees of freedom .",
    "we will , however , be interested in a less complete description , consisting of : the microscopic history of @xmath5 itself , and the net entropy generated , @xmath14 , over the course of the process . by the former , we mean a trajectory @xmath15 specifying the evolution of the microstate of the system of interest ( the position and momentum of each constituent degree of freedom ) , from @xmath16 to @xmath17 . by _",
    "entropy generated _ , we mean the quantity @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the net heat absorbed by @xmath5 from the @xmath20th reservoir , over the course of the process .",
    "we justify the nomenclature by noting that , at the macroscopic level of description , @xmath21 corresponds to the net change in the entropy of the @xmath20th reservoir .",
    "thus , @xmath14 can be viewed as the change in the entropy of the _ environment _ of @xmath5 ( the collection of reservoirs ) , which we abbreviate to `` entropy generated '' .",
    "( see also the definition of the rate of entropy production introduced in ref.@xcite . )",
    "note that both @xmath15 and @xmath14 can be obtained from the complete microscopic description , @xmath13 : the former , by projecting out the reservoir degrees of freedom ; the latter , by using the initial and final conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 to compute the net change in the internal energy of each reservoir .",
    "( see eq.[eq : defdq ] below , and commentary in section [ sec : disc ] ) .    because the system of interest interacts with the reservoirs , the microscopic evolution of @xmath5 itself is not deterministic .",
    "rather , an initial microstate @xmath24 determines a _ statistical ensemble _ of possible realizations , each characterized by a particular history @xmath15 , and a particular value of entropy generated @xmath14 .",
    "this is the ensemble of realizations which we would obtain by endlessly repeating the same process , always initializing @xmath5 in the microstate @xmath24 ; the difference from one realization to the next arises solely from the different initial conditions sampled for the reservoirs . from this ensemble ,",
    "let us imagine constructing the statistic @xmath25 which is the joint probability distribution of obtaining a final microstate @xmath26 , and an entropy generated @xmath14 , conditional on the initial microstate @xmath27 .",
    "this joint , conditional probability distribution @xmath28 will be the object of central interest in this paper .",
    "this is admittedly a somewhat peculiar quantity to investigate .",
    "no attempt will be made to motivate our interest in this statistic other than that `` it works '' , in the sense that consideration of @xmath29 leads to the neat result expressed by eq.[eq : central ] below .",
    "let us now introduce a final piece of notation .",
    "for an arbitrary process",
    "@xmath30 , let its _ time - reversed _ counterpart , @xmath31 , denote the process obtained by using the same set of reservoir temperatures , but carrying out the protocol of @xmath30 in reverse order ( reversing the time - dependence of both the work parameter and the thermal contacts established and broken ) .",
    "we will , quite arbitrarily , refer to @xmath30 as the `` forward '' process and @xmath31 as the `` reverse '' process . when discussing the conditional probability @xmath32 , computed for two processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 related by time - reversal , the notation @xmath33 and @xmath34 is used to distinguish between the two cases .",
    "the central result of this paper then asserts that the probability distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the following relation : @xmath35 where the asterisk ( @xmath36 ) denotes a reversal of momenta : @xmath37 . to obtain some intuition for what this result says , imagine filming the evolution of the system , work parameter , and reservoirs during one realization of the process @xmath30 , as the microstate of @xmath5 evolves from @xmath24 to @xmath38 and",
    "the entropy generated is @xmath14 .",
    "now imagine running the film backward ; you will then see a realization of the process @xmath31 , with @xmath5 evolving from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and entropy generation @xmath41 .",
    "eq.[eq : central ] thus relates the conditional probability of observing one set of events ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) during a given process , to that of observing the time - reversal of those events ( @xmath44 , @xmath41 ) during the time - reversed process : it states that the ratio of these two probabilities is just the exponent of the entropy generated , @xmath14 , in units of @xmath1 . for a static thermodynamic process",
    ", we have @xmath45 , and therefore we can drop the subscripts @xmath46 and @xmath47 appearing in eq.[eq : central ] .",
    "eq.[eq : central ] is a hybrid result , akin both to the fluctuation theorem ( through dependence on @xmath14 ) , and to a statement of detailed balance ( because of the appearance of the initial and final microstates of @xmath5 ) ; for this reason we refer to it as a _ detailed fluctuation theorem_.    note that if @xmath48 , then the conditional probability appearing in the numerator is greater than that in the denominator ; if @xmath49 , the opposite is true .",
    "this makes intuitive sense : of the two scenarios , the one which remains obedient to the second law by generating positive entropy is more likely than its disobedient twin , by a factor exponential in the entropy generated .",
    "the proof of eq.[eq : central ] will follow directly from the assumption that evolution in the full phase space ( including the degrees of freedom of @xmath50 ) is deterministic and hamiltonian . for a process @xmath8 , the statistical ensemble of realizations corresponding to a particular initial microstate @xmath24 for the system of interest",
    "is then defined operationally : it is the ensemble obtained by initializing @xmath5 in the microstate @xmath24 , then sampling the initial conditions of the reservoirs ( @xmath51 ) from canonical distributions at the specified temperatures ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "given @xmath24 , the choice of @xmath52 uniquely determines the subsequent evolution of all degrees of freedom , @xmath13 .",
    "the probability distribution of obtaining a given realization , conditional on a given microstate @xmath24 for @xmath5 , then reduces to that of sampling the appropriate initial microstates of the reservoirs .",
    "to carry out the derivation of eq.[eq : central ] , we begin by introducing notation and spelling out assumptions , starting with the classical approximation : all quantal effects are ignored .",
    "the system of interest , @xmath5 , is taken to have a finite number of degrees of freedom , and its instantaneous microstate is described by a point @xmath53 in the phase space of @xmath5 , with the usual assignment of @xmath54 to denote configurational variables , and @xmath55 the associated momenta . at any instant in time , the internal energy of @xmath5 is given by a hamiltonian @xmath56 , parametrized by the current value of the work parameter @xmath7 .",
    "next , assume that each heat reservoir @xmath57 is itself a classical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom , whose microstate is described by a point @xmath58 in the phase space associated with that reservoir .",
    "we do _ not _ assume the reservoirs to be physically identical , so the dimensionalities of the @xmath58 s may differ .",
    "the internal energy of the @xmath20th reservoir is given by a hamiltonian @xmath59 .",
    "finally , let @xmath60 denote a weak coupling term between the system of interest and the @xmath20th reservoir .",
    "as discussed below , thermal contact between @xmath5 and @xmath57 can be established or broken by turning this term `` on '' and `` off '' , using parameters @xmath61 .    for simplicity of presentation ,",
    "assume time - reversal invariance ( `` no magnetic fields '' ) for these hamiltonian terms : @xmath62    the vector @xmath63 specifies the instantaneous state of all degrees of freedom involved , where @xmath64 denotes the collective microstate of the @xmath65 reservoirs .",
    "the evolution of @xmath13 is taken to be deterministic , and governed by a hamiltonian @xmath66 here @xmath11 denotes the time - dependence of the work parameter , and the @xmath61 s take on values of 0 or 1 , which can also change with time . at a given time @xmath67 ,",
    "if @xmath68 , then this indicates that the system of interest is in thermal contact with the @xmath20th reservoir at that time ; when @xmath69 , @xmath5 and @xmath57 are _ not _ in contact .",
    "( more generally , we could let the @xmath70 s take on a continuous range of values , allowing the thermal contacts to be turned on and off smoothly rather than abruptly .",
    "this modification would have no effect on the analysis . )",
    "the collection @xmath71 represents the `` tool - kit '' available for externally manipulating the system of interest .",
    "the protocol for a given process , @xmath8 , is then just a particular prescription for doing so : it is synonymous with a specific set of functions of time , @xmath72 , instructing us exactly how to manipulate the work parameter and thermal contacts over a time interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this protocol uniquely specifies the time - dependence of the hamiltonian function @xmath73 , since that time - dependence enters only through @xmath11 and @xmath74 .",
    "we will use @xmath75 to denote the time - dependent hamiltonian corresponding to a particular process @xmath8 . if the protocol for a process @xmath30 is @xmath72 , then that of its time - reversed counterpart @xmath31 is given by @xmath76 .    while the time - dependence of the parameters @xmath77 is controlled externally ,",
    "the participating _ dynamical _ degrees of freedom @xmath78 evolve under hamilton s equations , as determined by @xmath79 .",
    "thus , initial conditions @xmath22 uniquely determine a trajectory @xmath13 , which chronicles the microscopic history of all degrees of freedom . from this trajectory , as mentioned earlier , we can extract both the microscopic history of the system of interest , @xmath15 ( by projecting out the reservoir variables @xmath80 ) , and the net heat absorbed by @xmath5 from each of the reservoirs .",
    "the heat absorbed by @xmath5 from a particular reservoir is equal to the net decrease in the internal energy of that reservoir : @xmath81 from the @xmath19 s we in turn compute the entropy generated ( eq.[eq : ent_gen ] ) .",
    "we note that , if @xmath82 is a microscopic realization of a process @xmath30 , then @xmath83 is a realization of the reverse process @xmath31 .",
    "this follows from the assumption of time - reversal invariance : if @xmath82 satisfies hamilton s equations for the forward process , then @xmath84 will do so for the reverse .    the reservoirs , as mentioned , are initially prepared at specified temperatures , @xmath9 .",
    "we take this to imply that their initial microstates @xmath85 are sampled from canonical ensembles .",
    "this defines the following probability distribution for the collection of initial reservoir conditions : @xmath86,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is a product of partition functions .",
    "finally , for a process @xmath30 and a set of initial conditions @xmath88 in the full phase space , let @xmath89 denote the point in phase space reached after time @xmath67 , and let @xmath90 denote the net entropy generated over the entire realization of the process ( from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) .",

    "finally , since the integrand is expressed in terms of @xmath110 , which is an invertible function of @xmath88 ( defined by time evolution , followed by a reversal of momenta ) , let us change the variables of integration from @xmath88 to @xmath110 .",
    "the jacobian for this change of variables is unity ( by liouville s theorem ) , so we simply replace @xmath115 by @xmath116 in eq.[eq : interm2 ] .",
    "but then we can drop the prime and asterisk altogether ( since @xmath110 is just a variable of integration ) to get : @xmath117\\cdot \\delta[{\\bf z}_b^*-\\hat{\\bf z}_-^0(\\gamma)]\\cdot \\delta[\\delta s+\\delta\\hat s_-(\\gamma ) ] \\\\ & = & e^{\\delta s / k_b } \\int d{\\bf y } p({\\bf y } ) \\delta[{\\bf z}_a^*-\\hat{\\bf z}_-^\\tau({\\bf z}_b^*,{\\bf y})]\\cdot \\delta[\\delta s+\\delta\\hat s_-({\\bf z}_b^*,{\\bf y } ) ] \\\\ & = & \\label{eq : final } e^{\\delta s / k_b } p_-({\\bf z}_a^*,-\\delta s\\vert { \\bf z}_b^*),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the desired result .    the origin of the exponential term in eq.[eq : central ]",
    "can be understood informally , as follows .",
    "given a `` forward '' realization @xmath82 , and its time - reversed image @xmath84 , @xmath118 is the probability distribution for sampling the reservoir initial conditions corresponding to the forward realization , relative to those corresponding to the reverse realization , from canonical distributions : @xmath119 .",

    "we end this section by pointing out that a result similar to eq.[eq : central ] can be derived for the statistic @xmath120 which is the joint probability distribution that @xmath5 will evolve through the sequence of points @xmath121 , at times @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , and that the entropy generated will be @xmath14 , given @xmath124 .",

    "the latter remains valid as well in the opposite limit , @xmath130 ( with @xmath4 fixed ) , in which case the entire history of @xmath5 is specified .",

    "perturbed by external forces of finite duration , we have @xmath134 , by definition .",
    "thus , by eq.[eq : m ] , the conditional probability distribution of observing the ( isolated ) system evolve through a given sequence of points during the process @xmath30 , is equal to that of observing it to pass through the time - reversed sequence during @xmath31 .",

    "( a technical point of difference is that bochkov and kuzovlev consider the _ unconditional _ probability of observing a given realization , _ assuming the system of interest begins in equilibrium _ , for both the forward and the reverse realization ; the exponential factor which they obtain is a ratio of probabilities of sampling microstates of @xmath5 itself from a given equilibrium distribution . )    for a single heat reservoir ( @xmath138 ) , eq.[eq : m ] is similar to eq.9 of ref.@xcite .",

    "we pursue the relationship between the detailed fluctuation theorem of this paper and the steady - state fluctuation theorem .    rather than aiming at complete generality , we will focus on a specific physical situation which might exhibit a nonequilibrium steady state in the appropriate limit , with the expectation that the line of reasoning applied here can serve as a model for other examples . in fig.[fig : ness ] , the system of interest is a fluid composed of particles of `` type @xmath143 '' , inside a finite cylindrical container of length @xmath144 .",

    "a somewhat different approach has been taken by eckmann , pillet , and rey - bellet@xcite , in their study of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to two infinite heat reservoirs .",

    "note that eq.8 of ref.@xcite can be viewed as a special case of eq.[eq : fed ] above , for the situation in which the initial and final hamiltonian functions are the same : @xmath255 , hence the free energy difference is identically zero : @xmath256 .",
    "the motivation for this paper has been a belief that one ought to be able to derive the fluctuation theorem  or something like it  within the framework of traditional statistical mechanics ; that is , by contemplating a system of interest interacting with a thermal environment .",
    "the central result of this exercise , eq.[eq : central ] , is a detailed fluctuation theorem , valid for finite times and made without reference to a steady state .",
    "given the definitions and assumptions made in this paper , eq.[eq : central ] is identically true .",
    "we now briefly address a number of issues related to this result .",
    "the first involves the definition of @xmath14 .",
    "specifying what is meant by the entropy generated during a single realization of a given process is inherently problematic , since entropy , in statistical mechanics , is ordinarily associated with an _ ensemble _ of microstates .",
    "eq.[eq : ent_gen ] must therefore be regarded as constituting a particular _ choice _ of definition of @xmath14 .",
    "this choice , however , is not entirely arbitrary , but rather ( as indicated in section [ sec : central ] ) guided by macroscopic thermodynamics , where the entropy increase of a thermal environment is identified with the heat , per unit temperature , absorbed by that environment .",
    "there is another apparently troubling feature of the definition of entropy generated : to compute @xmath14 , it seems we must know the exact initial and final microstates of each reservoir ( eq.[eq : defdq ] ) .",
    "this is extremely unsatisfying , as it conflicts with the usual notion of a thermal environment as a huge collection of unmonitored ( and uninteresting ) degrees of freedom `` out there '' .",
    "however , one can infer the @xmath19 values by monitoring the evolution of only those environmental degrees of freedom which are at any moment interacting ( exchanging energy ) with the system of interest . therefore if , due to short - range interaction forces , the exchange of energy between @xmath5 and the @xmath10 s occurs _ locally",
    "_  say , at an interface  then @xmath14 can be computed by knowing only what goes on in the immediate vicinity of the system of interest ( e.g.  within boundary layers of width @xmath257 in fig.[fig : ness ] ) , _ without _ explicit knowledge of initial and final reservoir energies .",
    "thus , while eq.[eq : defdq ] is indisputably useful as a device in the derivation of the detailed fluctuation theorem , that final result is really a statement about @xmath5 and the heat fluxes into and out of @xmath5 , rather than one about @xmath5 and initial and final reservoir energies .    finally , there is a bit of arbitrariness even in the definition of the heat absorbed by a given reservoir ( eq.[eq : defdq ] ) , owing to the small but finite interaction energy @xmath258 . as with eq.[eq : ent_gen ] , this definition represents a particular choice , but again this choice is consistent with macroscopic thermodynamics .    the derivation presented in section [ sec : derivation ]",
    "explicitly assumes that the reservoir degrees of freedom are initially sampled canonically ( eq.[eq : canon ] ) .",
    "the result itself , however , might not depend as strongly on this assumption as the derivation suggests .",
    "for macroscopically large reservoirs , eq.[eq : central ] ought to remain valid , at least to an excellent approximation , if the initial reservoir conditions are sampled from _",
    "micro_canonical , rather than canonical , distributions .",
    "the argument for this is similar to the usual one for the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical averages in the thermodynamic limit , and goes roughly as follows .",
    "imagine constructing a joint , conditional probability distribution @xmath259 defined in the same way as @xmath29 , but with reservoir initial conditions sampled from microcanonical distributions . in this case",
    "the temperatures @xmath260 appearing in the definition of @xmath14 are the `` microcanonical temperatures '' of the heat reservoirs : @xmath261.\\ ] ] @xmath262 depends on the set of initial reservoir energies , just as @xmath28 depends on the initial reservoir temperatures .",
    "explicitly , we can write @xmath263 where @xmath264 denotes the known initial energy _ per particle _",
    "( alternatively , per degree of freedom ) of the @xmath20th reservoir : @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the initial energy of , and @xmath267 the number of particles constituting , the @xmath20th reservoir . since the @xmath267 s are fixed , the initial microcanonical ensemble of each reservoir is uniquely specified by the value of @xmath264 .",
    "now , @xmath268 can be expressed as a weighted average of @xmath269 : @xmath270\\ , \\tilde p^{\\epsilon_1\\cdots \\epsilon_n } ( { \\bf z}_b,\\delta s\\vert{\\bf z}_a),\\ ] ] where @xmath271 is the statistical weight of the microcanonical ensemble at energy - per - particle @xmath264 , within the canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath260 , for the @xmath20th reservoir.$ ] , with the subscript @xmath20 suppressed . the normalization is chosen so that @xmath272 . ] in the thermodynamic limit of arbitrarily large reservoirs ( @xmath273 , with extensive and intensive quantities scaled appropriately ) , @xmath271 becomes peaked arbitrarily sharply around the value @xmath274 whose corresponding `` microcanonical temperature '' is equal to @xmath260 .",
    "assuming as in section [ sec : ft ] that @xmath262 converges to a well - defined function of @xmath24 , @xmath38 , and @xmath14 , we will therefore get , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath275 resulting in a microcanonical detailed fluctuation theorem .",
    "more generally , we expect eq.[eq : central ] to remain valid , provided that each reservoir is prepared in what would be characterized at the macroscopic level as a state of thermodynamic equilibrium ( regardless of whether the method of preparation truly yields a canonical distribution of microstates when carried out repeatedly ) .",
    "this reflects a strong prejudice that the canonical ensemble should be viewed primarily as a computational convenience , and ought not to be taken too seriously as characterizing the `` true '' statistical distribution of microstates of entire macroscopic bodies .",
    "of course , all this presupposes macroscopically large heat reservoirs ; for microscopic `` reservoirs '' , the detailed fluctuation theorem still holds , but its validity then depends on a literal interpretation of eq.[eq : canon ] .",
    "another issue involves the assumption of time - reversal invariance , eq.[eq : tri ] .",
    "while this assumption was made for convenience , it is straightforward to generalize the analysis to the situation in which ( possibly time - dependent ) magnetic fields are present . in that case ,",
    "given a process @xmath30 , its time - reversed counterpart @xmath31 is obtained by carrying out the protocol in reverse order , while also reversing all magnetic fields : @xmath276 . with this modification , eq.[eq : central ] remains valid ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of the detailed fluctuation theorem presented in this paper is admittedly not as `` clean '' as in previous works@xcite , where the ( deterministic or stochastic ) thermostating is accomplished without the explicit introduction of reservoir degrees of freedom . for instance , the present treatment forces us to consider the unphysical limit of infinite reservoirs ; caveats need to be made about ignoring interaction energies ; the time @xmath16 is privileged ( since that is when the reservoir microstates are sampled canonically ) ; and so forth .",
    "there is some consolation , however , in knowing that these messy issues are likely to arise in any laboratory setting , where real thermal environments and finite times of observation are an inherent part of the game .",
    "nos ' e - hoover - type thermostating schemes@xcite  employing one or a handful of `` reservoir '' degrees of freedom ( and non - hamiltonian equations of motion )  might offer an interesting middle ground between the deterministic thermostats of refs.@xcite and the approach taken here . in the original nos ' e - hoover scheme , the reservoir degree of freedom ( @xmath277 ) is initially sampled from a gaussian distribution . therefore , given an appropriate definition of @xmath14 , it would be straightforward to define a joint , conditional probability distribution @xmath278 , as in this paper , basically replacing the canonical distribution of initial reservoir conditions in eq.[eq : formal ] by the gaussian distribution of initial values of @xmath277",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether a detailed fluctuation theorem then follows .",
    "if so , this approach might lead ( by arguments along the lines of section [ sec : ft ] ) to a nos ' e - hoover steady - state fluctuation theorem .",
    "presumably some chaoticity assumption would still be required to make this result rigorous , but at least there would be no need to worry about infinitely large reservoirs !",
    "finally , it would be very nice to come up with a laboratory experiment to test the main result derived in this paper .",
    "the system of interest in such an experiment would doubtless have to have very few degrees of freedom ( ideally , only one ) , in order to collect data with sufficiently good statistics in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "furthermore , one would want a process during which the typical entropy generated is not much greater than @xmath1 ; otherwise , prohibitively many realizations would be needed before observing a single one for which @xmath49 . in this respect , the fact that eq.[eq : central ] is valid for _ finite _ durations @xmath4 is helpful .",
