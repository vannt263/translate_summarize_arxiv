    "to date , about 250 extrasolar planets have been identified using the indirect techniques of radial velocity , photometric transit and microlensing @xcite . the direct detection of a planet s light allows a detailed study of its physical properties and it is crucial to improve our undestanding of these objects .",
    "at present , one extrasolar planetary - mass companion has been directly imaged around the brown dwarf in the very young tw hydra association @xcite .",
    "several substellar companions with masses close but likely above the deuterium burning mass limit ( @xmath1 13 @xmath5 = 1047.7 m@xmath4 ] , @xcite ) have also been imaged around stellar and substellar primaries @xcite .",
    "all these systems are young ( @xmath7 50myr ) and have projected separations lower than 260au .",
    "there are also two unconfirmed planetary candidates imaged around brown dwarfs in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orionis clusters @xcite . here",
    ", we present the discovery of a companion near the deuterium burning mass limit located at the much wider projected separation of 670au from the brown dwarf @xcite , which belongs to the upper scorpius ( usco ) association .",
    "this is one of the youngest and closest ob associations to the sun , located at an average distance of 145@xmath02pc and with an estimated age of 56 myr , @xcite .",
    "we have searched for very red and faint companions ( @xmath10@xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath13 ) around 500 previously known members and candidates of the usco association ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) using the 2mass and denis catalogues database and the united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) plates . among other candidates",
    ", we identified a red source ( ) in the 2mass catalogue around uscoctio108 ( ) .",
    "follow - up observations in the @xmath14-band showed that the new object has @xmath15 and is located at an angular distance of 4.6@xmath00.1 and a position angle of 177@xmath01@xmath16 .",
    "additional optical and near - infrared imaging and low resolution spectroscopy were carried out using different instrumentation .",
    "the detailed observing log is provided in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "weather conditions were photometric at all the observatories and average seeing was in the range 0.71.0 .",
    "we reduced the data with standard techniques , using routines within the iraf environment , including bias and flat - field correction in the optical , and sky subtraction and flat - field correction in the near infrared .",
    "finally , we aligned and combined individual images to obtain the final one .",
    "a composite colour image using the @xmath17 bands of uscoctio108a and b is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we have performed aperture and psf photometry of the resulting images using the daophot package .",
    "optical and near - infrared images have been calibrated using bright sources in common with the denis and 2mass catalogues .",
    "the photometry of both the primary and the secondary are indicated in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the apall routine , wavelength calibrated , and corrected for the instrumental response with observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars and .",
    "near - infrared spectra have been corrected for telluric lines by dividing them by the a3-type star and multiplying by a blackbody of the corresponding effective temperature ( @xmath18 ) of 8500k .",
    "using the photometry from table  [ tab2 ] , we have determined that uscoctio108a and b belong to the photometric sequence of the usco association . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we represent an @xmath14 , @xmath19 color  magnitude diagram , where both objects are indicated by filled circles .",
    "the primary follows the sequence of previously known members @xcite and the secondary smoothly extrapolates it towards fainter magnitudes and redder colours .",
    "we note that uscoctio108b lies on the location of isolated planetary - mass objects in the @xmath8 orionis cluster @xcite when they are shifted to the distance of the usco association ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . using the wht and iac80 @xmath14-band images and the astrometry provided by 2mass",
    ", we have measured the proper motion of uscoctio108a to be ( @xmath20cos@xmath21 , @xmath22 = @xmath2314 , @xmath2413)masyr@xmath25 and uscoctio108b to be ( @xmath20cos@xmath21 , @xmath22 = @xmath2640 , @xmath2740)masyr@xmath25 .",
    "both measurements are consistent with the proper motion of the usco association ( @xmath20cos@xmath21 , @xmath22 = @xmath28 , @xmath29masyr@xmath25 , @xcite ) , but the large error bars of the secondary prevent us from reaching any firm conclusion .    we have determined the spectral classification of uscoctio108a and b by comparison with standard objects of well - known spectral type and using pc3 and pc4 indexes for the optical spectra @xcite and the water index at 1.2  @xmath30 m for the infrared ones @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present our spectra and data of other young ( , ) and field dwarfs ( , , ) taken from the literature ( see references in the caption of the figure ) .",
    "we have derived a spectral type for the primary of m7 with an error of half a subclass in both the optical and near - infrared spectra , although the bluer part of the optical spectrum seems to be of a hotter object .",
    "we estimate that the secondary is an m9.5 by comparison of the optical and @xmath10-band data with the young sources oph1622 - 2405b and kpnotau4 , an l1 according to the pseudocontinuum index pc3 ( [ 823827]/[754758]nm ) , and its near - infrared spectrum is similar to the l3 field dwarf 2massj1506544 + 132106 . the slightly different typings may be due to the effects of a low - pressure , cool atmosphere on the various optical and near - infrared spectroscopic features .",
    "we finally adopt a classification of m9.5 for uscoctio108b .",
    "the spectral types of the primary and secundary correspond to a @xmath18 of 2700@xmath0100k and 2350@xmath31k , respectively , adopting the temperature scale for high gravity field dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 of uscoctio108a is consistent with the @xmath18 calculated for both components of the low - gravity m6.5 eclipsing binary ( 2900 and 2800k ) .",
    "we have computed these values from the total luminosity ( estimated from the @xmath32-band magnitude , the bolometric correction from @xcite , and a distance of 480pc ) , the radii , and @xmath18 ratio given by @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy of uscoctio108a shows spectral features characteristic of youth , such as a very strong h@xmath33 ( equivalent width , ew @xmath34 ) and hei emission lines ( ew[5876]@xmath35 , ew[6678]@xmath36 ) , which indicate that the primary is still in the process of accreting from a disk .",
    "in addition , alkaline lines such as nai and ki are weaker than their field dwarf counterparts , which is characteristic of still contracting low - gravity objects .",
    "the lii line is also detected in absorption ( ew @xmath37 ) , but it is slightly less intense than expected for its spectral type and youth .",
    "this could be caused by the higher continuum in this region , i.e. , veiling , probably due to the accretion of material from the disk . by dividing its spectrum by that of other non - accreting m7 dwarfs , such as @xcite , @xcite and ( this paper ) , we estimate a veiling factor ( @xmath38 ) of 0.40.7 , which gives a corrected ew(lii ) = 0.60.8 , consistent with a total preservation of this element . optical spectroscopy of uscoctio108b also shows h@xmath33 in emission , but this is less intense than in the primary ( ew @xmath39 ) .",
    "the presence of this line is rare ( less than 20% ) in the spectra of field l dwarfs @xcite , and this could be a signature of youth .",
    "the nai and ki lines are weaker and the tio and vo molecular bands are more intense than expected for objects of the same spectral type in the field ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) , which are also indicative of youth .",
    "low - gravity features are even clearer in the @xmath10-band spectra , where both the primary and secondary show weaker k lines than the late - type field dwarfs .",
    "the hydrides ( feh and crh ) also appear weaker at optical and near - infrared wavelengths in the usco objects than in the field dwarfs .",
    "this is likely related to an intense tio absorption characteristic of low gravity , cool atmospheres @xcite . in summary , from optical and near - infrared spectroscopy , we may conclude that uscoctio108a and b have spectral features of a very young age , which support their membership of the usco association .",
    "we have derived the luminosity of both objects from their @xmath40-band magnitudes , the bolometric correction from @xcite , @xcite and the usco distance modulus @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we have not applied any reddening correction to apparent magnitudes since the extinction in the usco association is found to be quite small ( @xmath42 , @xcite ) .",
    "we have obtained a luminosity of @xmath43 for uscoctio108a and @xmath44 for uscoctio108b .",
    "we can estimate the mass of the objects by comparison of the derived luminosity with predictions from theoretical models @xcite . figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "shows the luminosity of both objects and other very low - mass substellar companions in comparison with evolutionary models from @xcite .",
    "isochrone fitting to the more massive stars sequence suggests an age of 56myr for usco @xcite . from this estimated age",
    ", we obtain a mass of @xmath45 for the primary , i.e. , within the brown dwarf domain , and a mass of @xmath46 for the secondary , i.e. , at the deuterium burning mass limit .",
    "the existence of li in very low - mass stars provide an alternative way to restrict the age of the association , because this element is destroyed very fast in their fully convective interiors .",
    "the comparison of the li abundance in early m - type members @xcite with theoretical spectral synthesis @xcite indicates that most of them preserve their initial li content . according to evolutionary models , this indicates that the age of the association is lower than 8myr and most likely in the interval 24myr ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the great similarity between the photometric sequences of usco and @xmath8 orionis , which has a likely age of 3 myr , when both star associations have been moved to the same distance , and uscoctio108a being still in a strong accretion phase , also argue in favor of a younger age for the system . adopting the wider range of ages of 18myr",
    ", we estimate a conservative wider mass range for both components : @xmath2@xmath47 for the primary and @xmath3@xmath47 for the secondary .",
    "once we have demonstrated that uscoctio108a and b are members of the usco association and we have estimated their masses , one question still remains open , which is whether the binary is physically bound or just a chance projection effect . to check this ,",
    "we have estimated the probability of finding a planetary - mass member ( @xmath48 ) in our search within a radious of 10around 500 members and candidates of the association .",
    "this exploration is limited by sensitivity of the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite , which is @xmath49 .",
    "we have derived the density of such objects with a @xmath10-band magnitude in the range of 1617.5 to be @xmath50deg@xmath51 from a survey @xcite that is much deeper than 2mass . assuming a poissonian distribution for the number of additional members in a given area",
    ", we can estimate this probability to be 1-@xmath52 , and @xmath53 , where @xmath52 is the probability of finding no additional member , @xmath54 is the number of events ( 500 ) , and @xmath55 is the expected number of objects in a 10radious ( @xmath56 ) , with the result that there is a probability of about 1.3% that uscoctio108b is another member of the association located by chance in the direction of uscoctio108a .",
    "if we consider only the probability of finding another member at the distance of uscoctio108b ( 4.6 ) , this probability turns out to be lower by a factor of 4.5 .",
    "the projected separation of both components , 670au for the average distance to the association , is also not very common in very low - mass stars and star / brown dwarf systems , but there are some known cases at this separation and even at larger ones ( see fig . 15 from @xcite ) .",
    "the escape velocity from the primary at this distance is only 0.4 kms@xmath25 and the gravitational bound energy of the system is 1.86@xmath5710@xmath58j .",
    "although other substellar pairs with similar mass ratio are known , the uscoctio108a and b system is the widest identified so far and possibly has a lowest gravitational bound energy than any other known low - mass binary ( see fig . 16 from @xcite ) . following the analytical solutions given in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the timescale of disruption of the system in an environment with the typical density of usco ( @xmath1 0.3 objectpc@xmath59 ) is a few hundred million years , which is a longer timescale than that expected for the dissipation of usco .",
    "in conclusion , we have found a @xmath3@xmath47 companion to the @xmath2@xmath47 brown dwarf uscoctio108 at an angular separation of 4.6@xmath00.1 ( projected distance of @xmath1670 au ) in the very young usco association .",
    "it seems very difficult to explain the in situ formation of this object in a disk by core accretion @xcite or disk instability @xcite .",
    "given the typical size and density profile of stellar disks , there does not seem to be enough mass at such a wide separation to form a companion of this mass , unless it has originated at a lower distance and migrated to its present location .",
    "this very low - mass substellar system has a low binding energy , implying that it is unlikely to have been ejected from a higher mass unstable multiple system @xcite .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the system was originated from the disruption of a more massive core @xcite in a way similar to other binary stars are supposed to be formed .",
    "if the formation of these wide and very low mass systems in the denser central part of clusters is relatively frequent , this could explain the existence of isolated planetary - mass objects as planetary - mass companions that became unbound from their primaries .",
