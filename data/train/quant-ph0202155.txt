    "since the discovery by shor @xcite nearly a decade ago of a quantum algorithm for efficient integer factorization there has been a rapidly growing interest in the development of new quantum algorithms capable of solving computational problems that are practically intractable on classical computers .",
    "perhaps the most notable example is that of a combinatorial optimization problem ( cop ) . in the simplest case",
    "the task in cop is to minimize the cost function (  energy \" ) @xmath2 defined on a set of @xmath3 binary strings @xmath4 @xmath5 , each containing @xmath0 bits . in quantum computation",
    "this cost function corresponds to a hamiltonian @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath5 and the summation is over @xmath3 states @xmath8 forming the computational basis of a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "state @xmath9 of the @xmath10-th qubit is an eigenstate of the pauli matrix @xmath11 with eigenvalue @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear from the above that the ground state of @xmath6 encodes the solution to the cop with cost function @xmath2 .",
    "cops have a direct analogy in physics , related to finding ground states of classical spin glass models . in the example above bits @xmath13 correspond to ising spins @xmath14 .",
    "the connection between the properties of frustrated disordered systems and the structure of the solution space of complex cops has been noted first by fu and anderson @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized @xcite that many of the spin glass models are in almost one - to - one correspondence with a number of cops from theoretical computer science that form the so - called np - complete class @xcite .",
    "this class contains hundreds of the most common computationally hard problems encountered in practice , such as constraint satisfaction , traveling salesmen , and integer programming .",
    "np - complete problems are characterized in the worst cases by exponential scaling of the running time or memory requirements with the problem size @xmath0 .",
    "a special property of the class is that any np - complete problem can be converted into any other np - complete problem in polynomial time on a classical computer ; therefore , it is sufficient to find a deterministic algorithm that can be guaranteed to solve all instances of just one of the np - complete problems within a polynomial time bound .",
    "it is widely believed , however , that such an algorithm does not exist on a classical computer ; whether it exists on a quantum computer is one of the central open questions .",
    "ultimately , one can expect that the behavior of new quantum algorithms for cops and their complexity will be closely related to the properties of quantum spin glasses .",
    "recently , farhi and co - workers suggested a new quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems which is based on the properties of quantum adiabatic evolution @xcite .",
    "running of the algorithm for several np - complete problems has been simulated on a classical computer using a large number of randomly generated problem instances that are believed to be computationally hard for classical algorithms @xcite .",
    "results of these numerical simulations for relatively small size of the problem instances ( @xmath15 20 ) suggest a _ quadratic _ scaling law of the run time of the quantum adiabatic algorithm with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that the previous query complexity argument that led to the exponential lower bound for unstructured search @xcite can not be used to rule out the polynomial time solution of np - complete satisfiability problem by the quantum adiabatic algorithm .    in @xcite special symmetric cases of cop",
    "were considered where symmetry of the problem allowed the authors to describe the true asymptotic behavior ( @xmath16 ) of the algorithm . in certain examples considered in @xcite",
    "the quantum adiabatic algorithm finds the solution in time polynomial in @xmath0 while simulated annealing requires exponential time .",
    "this effect occurs due to the special connectivity properties of the optimization problems that lead to the relatively large matrix elements for the spin tunneling in transverse magnetic field between different valleys during the quantum adiabatic algorithm . in the examples considered in @xcite the tunneling matrix element scales polynomially with @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , in simulated annealing different valleys are connected via classical activation processes for spins with probabilities that scale exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "it was also shown for certain simplified examples @xcite , that quantum adiabatic algorithm can be modified to completely suppress the tunneling barriers even if the corresponding classical cost function has local minima well separated in the space of spin configurations",
    ".    however , so far there are no study on the true asymptotic behavior of the algorithm for the general case of randomly generated hard instances of np - complete problems .",
    "also there are no analysis of the limitations of the quantum adiabatic computation arising from the intrinsic properties of disorder and frustration in this problems .",
    "such analysis is of the central interest in this paper .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : npp ] we introduce the random number partitioning problem and describes conditional cost distributions ( neighborhood properties ) in this problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qaea ] we describe the concept of quantum adiabatic computation applied to combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a green function method for the analysis of the minimum gap . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mingap ] we describe the effect of quantum diffusion in the algorithm dynamics , derive the scaling for the minimum gap and the complexity of the algorithm for the random number partitioning problem .",
    "we also obtain the scaling of the minimum gap numerically from the form of the cumulative density of the adiabatic eigenvalues at the avoided - crossing point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : udo ] we discuss the results of the simulations of the time - dependent schr \" odinger equation to simulate quantum adiabatic computation for number partitioning and obtain its complexity numerically .",
    "number partitioning problem ( npp ) is one of the six basic np - complete problems that are at the heart of the theory of np - completeness @xcite .",
    "it can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem : @xmath17 given a sequence of positive numbers @xmath18 find a partition , i.e. two disjoint subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 , such that the residue @xmath21 is minimized .",
    "in npp we search for the bit strings @xmath22 ( or corresponding ising spin configurations @xmath23 ) that minimize the energy or cost function @xmath2 @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) if @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) if @xmath30 . the partition @xmath31 with minimum residue",
    "can also be viewed as the ground state of the ising spin glass , @xmath32 , corresponding to the mattis - like antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath33 .",
    "npp has many practical applications including multiprocessor scheduling @xcite , cryptography @xcite , and others .",
    "the best deterministic heuristical algorithm for npp , the differencing method of karmakar and karp @xcite , can find with high probability solutions whose energies are of the order @xmath34 for some @xmath35 .",
    "the interest in npp also stems from the remarkable failure of a standard simulated annealing algorithm for the energy function ( [ omega ] ) to find good solutions , as compared with the solutions found by deterministic heuristics @xcite .",
    "the apparent reason for this failure is due to the existence of order @xmath3 local minima whose energies are of the order of @xmath36 @xcite which undermines the usual strategy of exploring the space of the spin configurations @xmath31 through single spin flips .",
    "the computational complexity of random instances of npp depends on the number of bits @xmath37 needed to encode the numbers @xmath38 . in what follows",
    "we will analyze npp with independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random b - bit numbers @xmath38 .",
    "numerical simulations show @xcite that solution time grows exponentially with @xmath0 for @xmath39 then decreases steeply for @xmath40 ( phenomenon of peaking \" ) and eventually grows polynomially for @xmath41 .",
    "the transition from the  hard \" to computationally  easy \" phases at @xmath42 has features somewhat similar to phase transitions in physical systems @xcite .",
    "the detailed theory of the phase transition in npp was given in refs .",
    "if one keeps the parameter @xmath43 fixed and lets @xmath44 then instances of npp corresponding to @xmath45 1 will have no perfect partitions with high probability . on the other hand for @xmath46 1 number of perfect partitions will grow exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "transitions of this kind were observed in various np - complete problems @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will focus on the computationally hard regime @xmath47 .",
    "the values of individual energies are random and depend on the particular instance of npp ( i.e. , the set of numbers @xmath38 ) .",
    "however on a coarse - grained scale ( i.e. after averaging over individual energy separations ) the form of the typical energy distribution is described by some universal function for randomly generated problem instances .",
    "we introduce for a given set of randomly sampled numbers @xmath38 a coarse - grained distribution function of signed partition residues @xmath48 ( [ omega ] ) @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the dirac delta - function ; the sum is over @xmath3 bit - strings @xmath51 and @xmath52 is a normalization factor . in ( [ rho ] )",
    "we average over an interval @xmath53 of the partition residues whose size is chosen self - consistently , @xmath54 . using ( [ omega ] ) we can rewrite ( [ rho ] ) in the form @xmath55 here @xmath56 is a window function that imposes a cut - off in the integral ( [ i ] ) at @xmath57 . for large @xmath0",
    "this integral can be evaluated using the steepest descent method . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the @xmath37-bit numbers @xmath38 are distributed inside of the unit interval @xmath58 $ ] and are integer multiples of @xmath59 , the smallest number that can be represented with available number of bits @xmath37 .",
    "we note that for large @xmath0 the function @xmath60 has sharp maxima ( minima ) with width @xmath61 at the points @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "only one saddle point at @xmath64 contributes to the integral in ( [ i ] ) due to coarse - graining of the distribution ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "indeed , it will be seen below that the window size @xmath65 can be chosen to obey the conditions @xmath66 .",
    "therefore in the case of high - precision numbers , @xmath67 , saddle - points @xmath68 with @xmath69 lie far outside the window and their contributions can be neglected ( see also appendix [ sec : subharmonics ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the window function @xmath56 can be replaced by unity while computing the contribution from the saddle - point at @xmath64 .",
    "finally we obtain for @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath71 the coarse - grained distribution @xmath72 depends on the set of @xmath38 s through a single self - averaging quantity @xmath73 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one can also introduce the distribution @xmath74 of cost values ( energies ) @xmath75 . due to the obvious symmetry of the npp ,",
    "the cost function @xmath2 in ( [ omega ] ) does not change after flipping signs of all spins , @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xmath77 we emphasize that , according to eq .",
    "( [ pgauss ] ) for a typical set of high - precision numbers @xmath38 the energy spectrum in npp is quasi - continuous , and there are only two scales present in the distribution @xmath78 : one is a microscopic \" scale given by the characteristic separation of the individual partition energies , @xmath79 , and another is given by the mean partition energy @xmath80 ( or the distribution width @xmath81 ) @xmath82 this justifies the choice for @xmath53 above that corresponds to coarse - graining over many individual energy level separations .",
    "we note that the distribution @xmath72 ( [ pgauss ] ) is gaussian for @xmath83 and can be understood in terms of a random walk with coordinate @xmath84 using eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) .",
    "the walk begins at the origin , @xmath85 , and makes a total of @xmath0 steps . at the @xmath10-th step",
    "@xmath84 moves to the right or to the left by distance \" @xmath86 if @xmath25 or @xmath28 , respectively . in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0",
    "the result ( [ pgauss ] ) corresponds to equal probabilities of right and left moves and the distribution of step lengths coinciding with that of the set of numbers @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the energy distribution function @xmath88 of the form ( [ pgauss]),([rhotilde ] ) was previously obtained by mertens @xcite using explicit averaging over the random instances of npp .",
    "he also computed the partition function @xmath89 for a given instance of npp at a small finite temperature @xmath90 using the steepest - descent method and summation over the saddle - points @xmath91 similar to our discussion above @xcite ( in his analysis @xmath92 played a role similar to our regularization factor @xmath53 in ( [ rho]),([i ] ) ) .",
    "we emphasize however , that the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite based on @xmath89 is necessarily restricted to the analysis of the static \" properties of npp at @xmath93 , i.e. , the phase transition in the number of perfect partitions @xcite when the control parameter @xmath94 crosses a critical value . on the other hand distribution @xmath72 ( [ rho ] )",
    "introduces at finite energies , as well as the conditional distribution introduced in the next section also allow us to directly study the intrinsic _ dynamical _ properties of the problem in question such as the dynamics of its quantum optimization algorithms .",
    "consider the set of bit - strings @xmath95 obtained from a given string @xmath51 by flipping @xmath96 bits .",
    "the conditional distribution of the partition residues @xmath97 ( [ omega ] ) in the @xmath96-neighborhood of @xmath51 can be characterized by its moments : @xmath98 here @xmath99 is a kronecker delta and function @xmath100 computes the number of bits that take different values in the bit - strings @xmath51 and @xmath101 .",
    "it is the so - called hamming distance between the two strings @xmath102 the hamming distance @xmath103 between the bit - strings is directly related to the overlap factor @xmath104 between the corresponding spin configurations often used in the theory of spin glasses @xcite : @xmath105 ( in what follows we shall use both quantities @xmath96 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "for @xmath106 in ( [ moments ] ) one obtains after straightforward calculation the first and second moments of the conditional distribution @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given in ( [ pgauss ] ) and ( [ meane ] ) , respectively .",
    "the conditional distribution of @xmath97 can also be defined in a way similar to ( [ rho ] ) @xmath110 where averaging is over the small interval @xmath111 that , however , includes many individual values of @xmath112 for a given @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ m1]),([m2 ] ) that the first two moments of @xmath113 depend on @xmath51 _ only _ via the value of @xmath48 .",
    "this does not hold true , however , for the higher - order moments that depend on other functions of @xmath51 as well .",
    "for example , @xmath114 involves the quantity @xmath115 , etc .",
    "our main observation is that in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0 the conditional distribution @xmath113 is well - described by the first two moments ( [ m1]),([m2 ] ) .",
    "then , according to the discussion above , its dependence on @xmath116 is only via @xmath48 .",
    "the detailed study of the higher moments ( [ moments ] ) will be done elsewhere .",
    "here we use the following intuitive approach relevant for analysis of the computational complexity of the quantum adiabatic algorithm for the npp .",
    "we average @xmath113 over the strings @xmath51 with residues @xmath48 inside a small interval @xmath53 ( containing , however , many levels @xmath48 ) .",
    "after such averaging the result , @xmath117 , can be written in the form @xmath118 where @xmath72 is given in ( [ pgauss ] ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ rhoomegaomega1 ] ) formally coincides with the bayesian rule expressing the conditional distribution function @xmath119 through the 2-point ( joint ) distribution function @xmath120 and the single - point distribution @xmath72 ( [ pgauss ] ) .",
