    "@xcite analyzed the recently discovered white dwarfs sdss  j133739 + 000142 and lhs  3250 @xcite , identifying both objects as extreme helium rich cool white dwarfs .",
    "however they encountered significant problems when attempting to fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that the discrepancy between their seds and the observed fluxes , is due to the physics used to calculate their model atmospheres .",
    "here we investigate the molecular ion heh@xmath0   as part of the missing physics of helium rich white dwarfs .",
    "we demonstrate that the opacity of a helium rich white dwarfs photosphere is significantly affected by heh@xmath0 . from the discussion of @xcite",
    ", it follows that increased opacity arising from heh@xmath0 , will lengthen the cooling time for helium rich white dwarfs with @xmath2@xmath3 8000  k.    the only attempts to study heh@xmath0   in helium rich white dwarfs known to us was made by @xcite .",
    "they showed that heh@xmath0   exists in significant quantities in helium rich white dwarfs and suggested a search for the infrared lines of heh@xmath0 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is a vital component of any model atmosphere , it links the state parameters such as temperature , pressure , density , and internal energy .",
    "it also calculates the relative abundance of each species within the gas , which are essential to obtain accurate radiative opacities .",
    "the photospheres of cool extremely helium rich white dwarfs have densities which can reach upward of 1 g @xmath4 , under such conditions the use of a non - ideal eos is required .",
    "we have adapted the non - ideal h / he eos of @xcite .",
    "this eos accounts for the non - ideal effects of electron degeneracy , coulomb coupling and pressure ionization , but lacks an accurate treatment of pressure dissociation .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath5   is estimated using an equilibrium constant for the reaction : h@xmath6 2h , so that h@xmath5   pressure dissociates as hydrogen pressure ionizes .    to account for the pressure ionization of h@xmath1 we have added a term to the hydrogen ionization equilibrium , given by eq .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 23 ) in @xcite , so that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ionization fraction of atomic and ionic hydrogen in the form of h@xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the grand partition functions of atomic hydrogen and a proton ( see @xcite eq . 23 )",
    ". the grand partition function of h@xmath1 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron degeneracy , @xmath13 is the sum of the ionization potential of hydrogen and h@xmath1 ( 14.352 ev ) , and @xmath14 is given by eq .",
    "( 11)-(16 ) in @xcite using a characteristic radius for h@xmath1 of 1.15    @xcite .    under certain conditions , the trace ionic molecules h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , heh@xmath0 , and he@xmath16   are responsible for nearly all the free electrons in a h / he gas .",
    "we calculate equilibrium constants for the formation of h@xmath5 , h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , heh@xmath0 , and he@xmath16  from atomic h and he , h@xmath1 , and free electrons with the saha equation .",
    "subject to conservation of charge , and of h and he nuclei , the equilibrium constants and ionization fractions are used to construct 3 non - linear simultaneous equations .",
    "these 3 equations are solved using a multi - variable newton - raphson technique . in this way the number densities for each species can be calculated for any given temperature , pressure , hydrogen fraction and value of @xmath12 .",
    "the internal partition functions we use are detailed in @xcite , for heh@xmath0   we use the partition function of @xcite . a converged value of @xmath12 is found by iterating over a further conservation of charge equation : @xmath18 where n@xmath19 is the number density of species @xmath20",
    ", @xmath21 is the free electron coulomb coupling energy @xcite , @xmath22 is a fermi - dirac integral , t is temperature and a constant @xmath23 .",
    "the left hand side of eq [ eq : coneq ] is the number density of free electrons ( see @xcite ) and the right hand side counts the charge on all ions .",
    "figure [ fig : eos ] shows the number fraction of the species within our eos , as a function of h to he number ratio , density , and temperature . at 5000  k and density of 0.2 g @xmath4 h@xmath17   is the dominant positive ion for the hydrogen rich case .",
    "heh@xmath0   is the dominant positive ion for the helium rich range @xmath24 and he@xmath16   becomes the dominant positive ion for @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : eos ] indicates that heh@xmath0   continues to be the dominant positive ion over a range of densities and temperatures .",
    "@xcite present an eos and mean opacities for a h / he gas of 72% hydrogen by mass , they correctly state that the opacity coefficent of heh@xmath0   is wholely irrelevant . however , as illustrated below , for a helium rich mix heh@xmath0   strongly affects the opacity and can not be neglected .",
    "the opacity of a gas under the extreme pressures found in the photospheres of helium rich white dwarfs remains in question @xcite .",
    "the opacity of a cool helium rich atmosphere is dominated by h@xmath5-he collision induced and he@xmath1 free - free absorption , and he  i   rayleigh scattering @xcite .",
    "as such the opacity is strongly dependent upon the abundance of free electrons and h@xmath5 .",
    "the sources of opacity data that we use is discussed in @xcite .    the monochromatic absorption coefficient at @xmath26  g @xmath4 , @xmath27@xmath285 , over a range of temperatures , computed both including and neglecting heh@xmath0   from our eos , is shown in figure [ fig : opa - t ] .",
    "it is evident that if heh@xmath0   is neglected the gas opacity can be underestimated by as much as a factor of 5 , over a significant range of temperatures .",
    "the dominant opacity , across the frequency range shown in figure [ fig : opa - t ] and for temperatures upward of 5000 k , is he@xmath1 free - free absorption . at lower temperatures",
    "collision induced absorption , in the infrared , and he  i   rayleigh scattering , in the visible / ultra - violet , become important and eventually take over from he@xmath1 free - free .    to determine if heh@xmath0   rotation - vibration lines would be observable in a helium rich white dwarf",
    "we have employed the recent publicly available heh@xmath0   linelist of @xcite .",
    "we find that the absorption lines of heh@xmath0   are too weak to overcome the continuous opacity , under the temperatures and densities found in helium rich white dwarfs",
    ". therefore heh@xmath0   lines will not be visible in the spectra of helium rich white dwarfs . for a discussion of heh@xmath0   line opacity and some of the temperatures densities in which it is important see @xcite .",
    "we use the plane parallel model atmosphere code marcs @xcite , modified for the new non - ideal eos subroutines , discussed in section [ sec : eos ] , and the new continuous opacity subroutines , discussed in section [ sec : opacity ] . the new eos and opacity function subroutines are fast enough to be run in real time .    as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , in the optically thin regions , the unusual opacity function of a metal free h / he gas results in multiple roots in the equation of radiative equilibrium . the high temperature solution to radiative equilibrium in the optically thin regions",
    "is preferentially found in our models .",
    "such a solution is not physically realistic , rendering our models of @xmath2@xmath295000  k below @xmath30 unreliable .",
    "however , as this only occurs at very small optical depths the emergent flux is unaffected .",
    "we also experienced a problem with convergence of the convective flux at temperatures of 5000  k and below .",
    "the pressure - temperature gradient ( @xmath31 ) is very close to the adiabatic gradient ( @xmath32 ) , so that @xmath33 in the convective zone . in the cool highly non - ideal regions , numerical noise in the value of @xmath32 calculated within our eos",
    "is of this order , resulting in convergence problems with the convective flux .",
    "we have therefore not been able to obtain converged models below @xmath2@xmath284500  k.    we have computed a set of model atmospheres for @xmath34 , @xmath27@xmath35 , and between effective temperatures of 4500 and 8000  k , including and neglecting heh@xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : atm ] shows optical depth verses temperature and density for model atmospheres of 4500 , 5000 , 6000 , 7000 and 8000  k. although the temperatures remain relatively unperturbed by the inclusion of heh@xmath0 , there is a very strong affect upon the density and pressure .",
    "if heh@xmath0   is neglected then the density and pressure can be overestimated by up to a factor 5 , similarly the electron pressure significantly underestimated . for @xmath2   of @xmath36 8000  k",
    "there are significant electrons released from h  ii   and he  ii , which reduces the importance of heh@xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows the seds of our 4500 , 5000 and 6000  k models , with and without heh@xmath0 .",
    "the 4500 and 5000  k seds show a significant changes if heh@xmath0   is included in the ionization equilibrium , but the effect is only small for the 6000 k model .",
    "the reason for this is that above @xmath375000  k he@xmath1 free - free is the only significant source of opacity , so although the total opacity is increased the shape of the absorption function and hence sed is unchanged . for temperatures below 5500  k , he rayleigh scattering and he - h@xmath5 collision induced absorption contribute to opacity . as these opacity sources are unaffected by the increased abundance of electrons from heh@xmath0 , the increase in he@xmath1 free - free",
    "opacity changes the shape of the total opacity function and sed .",
    "these differences are reflected in the broadband color indexes given in tables [ tab:1 ] and [ tab:2 ] .",
    "these colors were computed by using the bandpasses given by @xcite and calibrating using a spectrum of vega .",
    "there are significant differences , at @xmath2@xmath285500  k and below , between colors computed whilst including and neglecting heh@xmath0 .",
    "the large increase in the v  k magnitude , and most of the other color indices indicates that the models calculated with heh@xmath0   are significantly redder than the models calculated without heh@xmath0 , this is also apparent in the seds .",
    "in general all our colors are redder than the colors of @xcite .",
    "a non - ideal h / he equation of state ( eos ) which includes the molecular ion heh@xmath0   within the ionization equilibrium , has been presented .",
    "it has been demonstrated , that under helium rich conditions and over a range of temperatures and densities relevant to helium rich white dwarfs , heh@xmath0   is the dominant positive ion . using the eos ,",
    "we have computed a set of continuous opacities which illustrate that heh@xmath0   can indirectly increase the opacity of a helium rich gas by up to a factor of 5 .",
    "using the recent heh@xmath0   linelist of @xcite , we have found that heh@xmath0   line opacity does not significantly contribute to the opacity at the densities found in helium rich white dwarfs .    from a physical point of view one of the most interesting reasons for studying helium rich white dwarfs",
    "is that the densities of their photospheres access regions in which the gas is strongly non - ideal . @xcite",
    "have studied the pressure dissociation of h@xmath5   in a pure hydrogen environment . however , one of the shortcomings of our , and all other equations of state known to us is that there has been no study of the pressure dissociation of the important molecular ions , h@xmath17 .",
    "heh@xmath0 , and he@xmath16 .",
    "before we can fully understand helium rich white dwarfs , our understanding of the physics of cool dense h / he plasmas must be improved .",
    "our eos and opacity function have been incorporated into a version of marcs @xcite . using this code",
    "we have computed model atmospheres , spectral energy distributions and broad band color indices for an illustrative range of helium rich white dwarfs .",
    "we find that in all models below 8000  k the pressure and density of the model atmospheres is reduced by up to a factor of five by the inclusion of heh@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , heh@xmath0  significantly reddens the seds and color indices , for models below @xmath2@xmath28 5500  k. the importance of heh@xmath0   should prompt a review of all current model atmospheres , synthetic spectra and cooling curves for cool helium rich white dwarfs .",
