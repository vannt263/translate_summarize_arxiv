    "a systematic study of the propagation of electromagnetic pulses in a dispersive medium originated with sommerfeld @xcite and brillouin @xcite . the subject has subsequently been studied by means of a number of interesting methods and novel interpretations ; see for example references and references therein .",
    "some of these methods are extensions to the classic sommerfeld - brillouin theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is firstly to provide an analytic expression for the behavior of dispersive wave packets by use of a straightforward method [ see eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) ] , along with a description of the initial conditions that must be satisfied in order to render this expression valid .",
    "secondly , we furnish the explicit formula that results when the method is applied to the case of gaussian pulses in a cold plasma [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ] .",
    "we conclude by using the method to discuss and exhibit features of the dispersive propagation and interaction of multiple pulses in such a plasma .",
    "the method we employ is based on taylor expansion techniques and gaussian wave packet expansion techniques that allow required integrals to be computed exactly .",
    "more specifically , we expand an initial wave packet as a superposition of gaussian packets ; then power - expand the dispersion relation to second order around the dominant wavenumber of each gaussian .",
    "this allows for an exact solution of the fourier integral describing the evolution of the packet .",
    "we take as our starting point the standard linear fourier integral @xcite describing the propagation of a pulse @xmath0 in a medium of dispersion @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 must be chosen to satisfy the initial boundary conditions for @xmath0 @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath4 , so that @xmath3 is just the fourier transform of the initial pulse @xmath5 @xcite ,    @xmath6    we then take the real part of eq .",

    "we now outline some of the features of the dispersive behavior of a single pulse in a cold plasma , which can be observed from plots of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "it is readily observed that the envelope of a short initial pulse broadens more rapidly as time elapses compared to the broadening of the envelope of a long initial pulse , the initial pulse frequencies being equal .",
    "this is of course well known , and can be explained analytically @xcite .",
    "it is also seen that in general , the number of oscillations within the pulse envelope increases with time , and more interestingly , the effect of dispersion on the pulse is to shift high - frequency components of the pulse toward the spatial front of the pulse and low - frequency components of the pulse toward the spatial rear of the pulse ( see the pulse @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this effect becomes more prominent as the initial pulse is shortened .",
    "additionally , the spatial packet velocity of a pulse increases as the pulse frequency is increased ( with spatial packet velocity we mean @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the distance traveled by the spatial maximum of the pulse envelope during a given time period @xmath81 .",
    "temporal pulse velocity is similarly defined as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the time that elapses before the temporal maximum of the pulse envelope appears at a given distance @xmath84 @xcite ) .",
    "however , as expected , in no cases is the center of a packet beyond the point @xmath85 at time @xmath81 if it is at the origin @xmath47 at time @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the velocity of light in vacuum , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) from the dispersion relation ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the envelope shape is better maintained for a high frequency initial pulse than for a low frequency initial pulse , the initial pulse durations being equal .",
    "therefore , increasing the frequency of a short pulse will improve the preservation of its shape as it travels through a dispersive medium , as well as increase its packet speed .",
    "the propagation of short , high - frequency pulses is a topic of strong current interest @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we next examine the the dispersive evolution of more than one ( right - traveling ) pulse through a cold plasma .",
    "one can readily do this by repetitive use of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "for example , the propagation of two initial pulses @xmath87 and @xmath88 separated by an initial time delay @xmath89 is described by    @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are obtained by substituting ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) and ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) respectively , into eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "the first pulse @xmath78 is here @xmath89 time units ahead of the second pulse @xmath98 when @xmath98 passes the origin @xmath47 at the time @xmath86 ( a description of the general dispersive behavior of @xmath99 initial pulses @xmath100 of the form ( [ eq4 ] ) separated by initial time delays @xmath101 can analogously be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) by the set of substitutions @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 for @xmath17 and @xmath105 ) .",

    "( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] )",
    ". these figures also illustrate some of the properties of single pulse propagation mentioned above ( note that the packets in the top plots of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] at the initial time @xmath86 are identical to those given by eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , except that their amplitudes have half the magnitude of those in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "this is because half of the energy of the initial packets is carried by the left - traveling parts of @xmath74 , which are omitted from all plots ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows how two initially distinct packets of the same frequency and duration gradually overlap and interact with each other due to the dispersive stretching of the two packets as time elapses .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of the interaction after a very long time .",
    "one can clearly see the emergence of constructive and destructive interference effects among the different spatial regions of the coalescing pulses .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , a high frequency , short pulse is dispatched after the dispatch of a low frequency , long pulse .",
    "we see that the high frequency pulse eventually overtakes the low frequency pulse , in accord with the single - pulse feature that the packet velocity is greater for a high - frequency initial pulse than a low - frequency initial pulse .",
    "the middle and bottom plots show how the high frequency pulse interferes with the various spatial parts of the low frequency pulse .",
    "the bottom plot depicts an instant of constructive interference between the two pulses , where the total amplitude is larger than the separate amplitudes of either pulse . for longer times than those shown in the figure , the high frequency pulse eventually passes and leaves the other pulse .    as a final example of a usage of eq .",
