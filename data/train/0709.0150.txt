    "we next have the following result which combines theorems of ezell  @xcite and edmonds - kulkarny - stong  @xcite :    a candidate surface branched cover @xmath9 is realizable if either @xmath13 is non - orientable and @xmath33 , or @xmath13 is the projective plane and @xmath12 is non - orientable .    according to these results",
    "the problem of the realizability of @xmath9 remains open only if @xmath12 is orientable and @xmath13 is either the sphere @xmath34 or the projective plane .",
    "however other results in  @xcite allow to reduce the latter case to the former one .",
    "for this reason we will restrict in the rest of this paper to the case @xmath35 .",
    "many exceptions are known in this case , the easiest of which is @xmath36 but the general pattern of realizability and exceptionality remains elusive . the following conjecture suggesting connections with number - theoretic facts was however proposed in  @xcite :    [ prime : conj ] if @xmath37 is a candidate surface branched cover and the degree @xmath1 is a prime number then the candidate is realizable .",
    "its validity was recently supported by the results and computer experiments of zheng  @xcite and by the results of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in the rest of this paper we will review five different techniques employed to attack the hurwitz problem , using them we will give five independent proofs of the exceptionality of @xmath10 , and we will state the main results they have led to .",
    "we address the reader to  @xcite for more details .",
    "hurwitz himself already showed that the problem of realizability of a candidate surface branched cover can be reformulated , using the notion of monodromy , in terms of permutations .",

    "let @xmath39 denote the surface obtained from the sphere @xmath34 by removing @xmath3 open discs with disjoint closures .",
    "clearly , @xmath14 induces a genuine cover @xmath40 such that each boundary component of @xmath41 is covered by two boundary components of @xmath42 , and the degrees of the restrictions to these components are ( 2,2 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,1 ) .",
    "choose two simple proper disjoint arcs @xmath43 , @xmath44 cutting @xmath41 into a 2-disc @xmath45 , and denote by @xmath46 the arcs in the boundary of @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "now note that a genuine cover over a disc is given by a disjoint union of discs , each of which is mapped homeomorphically to the target .",
    "therefore each degree-4 cover over @xmath41 can be reconstructed in the following way .",
    "we first take the disjoint union of @xmath48 copies @xmath49 of @xmath45 , with the corresponding arcs @xmath50 , and we choose two permutations @xmath51 .",
    "then we glue each @xmath52 to @xmath53 and we project to @xmath41 in the obvious way .",
    "it is easy to show that the degrees of the covers over the boundary components of @xmath41 are then given by the lengths of the cycles of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",

    "so in all cases one has to deal with a small number of topological types of dessins denfant , and a slightly larger number of inequivalent embeddings of these graphs in the relevant surface @xmath12 .",

    "the complement of the graph consists of 4 black and 4 white discs ( because the degree of @xmath14 is 4 ) .",
    "each disc is actually a ( curvilinear ) triangle , and whenever two triangles share an edge they have different colours ( as in a checkerboard , whence the name of the technique ) .",
    "see figure  [ checker:1:sample : fig ] .",
    "we now modify our graph by merging together all the black triangles into one black disc , and all the white triangles into one white disc .",
    "this is done by moves such as those of figure  [ checker:2:sample : fig ] .",
    "the moves are applied successively and in such a way that each time the pairs of local germs of discs merged together belong to different global discs .",
    "in addition to performing this merging , as also shown in figure  [ checker:2:sample : fig ] , we insert some vertices and arcs labelled @xmath109 , @xmath77 or @xmath110 , with obvious conventions .",

    "it is not difficult to prove that , after all the merging , on the boundary of the single black disc there are 12 vertices , with labels @xmath113 repeated cyclically 4 times . in addition there are two arcs labelled @xmath109 with vertices @xmath109 at the ends , two similar arcs labelled @xmath77 , and an arc labelled @xmath110 with two vertices labelled @xmath110 at the ends and one in the middle .",
    "there are a few different possibilities for the background colours of the arcs , and by examining all of them one sees that this triple actually can not exist .",
    "one of the situations to consider is shown as an example in figure  [ checker:3:sample : fig ] ,        where after insertion of the arcs labelled @xmath109 and @xmath77 it is impossible to draw the arc labelled @xmath110 , because the arcs must be mutually disjoint .",
    "this shows that the initial assumption about the existence of @xmath14 was absurd , which implies once again that @xmath10 is exceptional .",

    "the strategy used in the example extends as follows to the general situation .",
    "suppose we have a map realizing a candidate surface branched cover @xmath115 .",
    "then we arrange the branching points to be the @xmath3-th roots of @xmath109 and we consider the graph @xmath111 .",
    "giving black colour to the complementary discs mapped to @xmath45 , and white to the other discs , we see that @xmath111 is a checkerboard graph in @xmath12 . putting labels on the vertices and performing moves as those in figure  [ checker:2:sample : fig ] ( each consisting in the merging of two discs and the insertion of a labelled arc )",
    ", we end up with a checkerboard graph whose complement consists of a single black and a single white disc , together with a collection of labelled vertices and disjoint trees satisfying a long list of conditions in terms of the partitions @xmath116",
    ". the precise list would be too long to give here , so we address the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the main point is however that the whole process is reversible , namely from a checkerboard graph and a family of labelled vertices and trees satisfying the conditions corresponding to some candidate branched surface cover @xmath115 one can construct a map realizing the candidate .",
    "thus checkerboard graphs give a necessary and sufficient criterion for realizability .",

    "a composition of branched covers is a branched cover , so if a candidate can be expressed as a `` candidate composition '' of two realizable covers then it is realizable . on the other hand",
    "if one has a candidate cover and one can show that a map realizing it , if any , should be the composition of two maps one of which realizes an exceptional cover , one deduces that the original cover is exceptional too .",
