    "we present evidence herein for the presence of an unique , 2.14-ms pulsar , which appears to precess and whose spindown is apparently dominated by gravitational radiation , but one which has also been very difficult to detect over the past three years due to its faintness and the complicated nature of its signal .",
    "a more detailed and exhaustive treatment of this candidate and upper limits for any other signal are given elsewhere ( middleditch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the observations discussed in this work were made between feb .",

    "in addition , archival data from the hst on sn1987a was also used .",
    "a gaas tube with an 800 nm longpass filter were used for the first year ( ibid . ) .",

    "the 2nd harmonic phase was twice that of the fundamental , a sure sign of a `` peaked '' pulse profile , which turned out to have a noise probability of @xmath5 when actually computed .",
    "this profile is shown in fig .  1 , folded into 20 phase bins per cycle , together with results from the u.  tas 1-m which will be discussed in part below .",
    "the statistics of the pulse profiles are derived from folding into 11 phase bins .",
    "we continued to observe sn1987a with the 800 nm longpass filter in the year following the initial appearance of the 2.14-ms signal .",
    "a targeted search was made using the sum of the complex fourier amplitudes , a(f ) , near the @xmath1467.5 hz fundamental frequency , f , with those near the @xmath1935 hz second harmonic , a(2f ) , computed in the following way :   @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the phase of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the phase of @xmath10 .",
    "on the night of 6 feb .",
    "ut 1993 , in a run on the lco 2.5-m which lasted @xmath180 minutes before high humidity forced an early termination ( conditions were otherwise perfect ) , an unusual pattern of power appeared in the sum of the fourier spectra from frequency regions encompassing 467.4843 hz ( close to the extrapolation of the feb .",
    " 92 frequency ) and twice this value ( fig .  2 )",
    "the three high peaks in the sum power spectrum , are , to within errors , evenly spaced by 0.00214 hz , modulo the 467.5 hz fundamental frequency , and immediately suggest a periodic modulation in the phase / frequency and/or amplitude of the 2.14 ms signal with a period of @xmath1467 s. the 467.48429 hz frequency of the central peak ( 1/3 of the frequency of the top scale ) also indicates a _",

    "the probability of noise producing three such peaks in the sum spectrum , each exceeding 10 times mean power , is less than @xmath11 , even considering the rest of the data from feb .",

    " 92 ( middleditch et al . 2000 ) . further modulation structure of the individual fourier power peaks of the fundamental and 2nd harmonic lead to a further , very conservative , reduction in this probability by a factor of 100 , in addition to the realization that the period of modulation was actually twice 467.5 s , or 935 s. thus the probability fell to 10@xmath12 .",
    "the remainder of the data from lco during 1992 and feb .",
    "1993 was searched for the 2.14 ms signal and @xmath11,000 s modulation , and evidence was found for this signal and modulation in data taken on the other nights at lco and ctio ( the 3rd , 5th , 7th , 11th , and 12th of feb .  ",
    "93 ) and in two of three nights during nov .",
    " 92 ( the 6th and 8th ) .",
    "in addition , a moderately strong and consistent 1430 s modulation was found in the data from feb .",
    "by the time the pattern of the 2.14 ms signal was beginning to be discerned , the regular ",
    "92/93 observing season was over . in order to continue observations during an interval in which the signal seemed reasonably consistent ,",
    "observations had to be made from farther south . thus the search continued ( in the broad s20 band ) with the 1-m telescope of the university of tasmania , which was sufficiently far south to allow observations of sn1987a while under the pole ( and through at most 2.7 airmasses ) .",
    "a peak in the fourier power spectrum at 467.481992 ( 5 ) hz was found in the initial observation made from tasmania on may 16 , 1993 ut . the pulse profile had `` flat '' main and interpulses , both of which sharpened far more than would be expected from noise ( which would have added only relatively `` smooth '' structure ) when the obvious @xmath11,000 s phase modulation of the 2nd harmonic was incorporated into the pulse folding ( see middleditch et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the next observation , made on july 26 , 1993 , has over ten times mean power for a fundamental frequency near 467.48056(1 ) hz , and a second harmonic with about half as much power at exactly twice this frequency , and stands out very clearly in the sum spectrum ( fig .",
    "the pulse profile of this signal confirmed the fourier spectral analysis , indicates a mean magnitude of 21.6 for the 320 - 750 nm s20 band , and is similar to that of the feb .   92 observations ( fig",
    ".  1 ) .",
    "sn1987a was observed again four weeks later on 23 august  93 .",
    "analysis of this observation revealed a peak in the sum of the 2nd and third harmonics , and in addition , power in the fourth and fifth harmonics , when folded at 467.479874(4 ) hz .",
    "unusually high numbers ( 0.67@xmath130.073 and @xmath130.095 , where 0.5 is expected  middleditch et al .",
    "1993 ) for the centroids of harmonics 2 and 5 ( 3 and 4 were still @xmath14 0.5 ) led to the discovery that most of the contribution to the main pulse occurred during the last hour of the observation . the pulse profile for this hour , a single sharp pulse , is less probable still than that of the july 26 data ( 2.44@xmath210@xmath12 ) , and the peak in the sum spectrum produced by the 2nd and third harmonics for this run is even higher than that shown in fig .",
    "3 .    observations of sn1987a and detections of the 2.14 ms signal continued on the big telescopes , in spite of the fading of the signal after sep .",
    " 93 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the data from all telescopes , large and small , remain consistent .",
    "if the apparent precession is a result of the _ same _ non - axisymmetric oblateness ( relative to the axis of rotation ) which drives the apparent spindown , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rotational frequency of the pulsar , @xmath18 is the precession frequency , i is the moment of inertia of the ( precessing part of ) the neutron star , @xmath19 is the non - axisymmetric contribution to i , and @xmath20 is the spindown . combining these gives , @xmath21 ( fig .  5 ) .",
