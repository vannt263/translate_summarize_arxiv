    "the light quark masses , despite being fundamental parameters of the standard model , are surprisingly poorly known at present . since , in the standard ( `` large condensate '' ) scenario for the chiral counting in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , however , the ratio @xmath5 is known@xcite , fixing either @xmath6 or @xmath7 is sufficient to determine the other . in this paper",
    "we focus on @xmath6 , which has been the subject of several recent investigations , employing both qcd sum rules@xcite and lattice qcd @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "reliable results are presently restricted to the quenched approximation and vary somewhat depending on the fermion implementation and on whether one chooses @xmath8 or @xmath9 when matching to physical meson masses .",
    "unquenched calculations are at a more preliminary stage , but suggest unquenching is likely to lower quenched results@xcite .",
    "recent quenched results for @xmath6 ( where here , as in what follows , all masses , unless otherwise specified , will be quoted at a scale @xmath10 gev in the @xmath11 scheme ) are @xmath12 mev@xcite , @xmath13 mev@xcite , @xmath14 mev@xcite , @xmath15 mev@xcite ( for @xmath16 input ) , @xmath17 mev@xcite , @xmath18 mev@xcite ( update as quoted by kenway@xcite ) , @xmath19 mev@xcite , @xmath20 mev@xcite and @xmath21 mev@xcite . for dynamical ( @xmath22 ) simulations , the cp - pacs results @xmath23 mev ( with @xmath24 as input ) and",
    "sesam result @xmath25 mev@xcite do not appear compatible .",
    "( note , however , that there are unresolved issues of chiral extrapolations , renormalization constants , and the lack of extrapolation to the continuum limit in the sesam result ; for a further discussion of these issues see section 6 of the review by bhattacharya and gupta@xcite , and allton@xcite . )",
    "recent attempts to extract @xmath6 using qcd sum rules are of four types . two employ flavor - breaking differences of vector and/or axial vector current correlators , either the isovector - hypercharge difference@xcite or the isovector - strange difference@xcite .",
    "the others involve analyses of the strange scalar@xcite and strange pseudoscalar@xcite channels .    for the vector current isovector - hypercharge difference ,",
    "isospin - breaking corrections are crucial due to the high degree of cancellation on the hadronic side of the sum rule .",
    "these are , for natural reasons@xcite , larger than one would naively expect , and can only be obtained indirectly@xcite .",
    "the high degree of cancellation also magnifies experimental and theoretical uncertainties , leading to significant errors on @xmath6 ( @xmath26 mev@xcite , if one takes the isovector spectral function from hadronic @xmath27 decay data@xcite ) .    the isovector - strange difference , which employs @xmath27 decay data for the isovector and strange spectral functions , is subject to complications resulting from ( 1 ) very poor convergence of the perturbative series for the longitudinal contributions on the ope side@xcite , and ( 2 ) strong cancellation , which again significantly magnifies the effect of the ( otherwise rather small ) experimental errors . combining errors in quadrature and translating to the scale @xmath28 gev",
    ", one finds @xmath29 mev@xcite , @xmath30 mev@xcite and @xmath31 mev@xcite .",
    "the third approach involves the correlator @xmath32 ( where @xmath33)@xcite . in this case , the @xmath34 pole contribution to @xmath35 is known , but contributions from the continuum ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 resonance region ) are not . both analyses of this type",
    "employ a sum - of - breit - wigner modulation of the near - threshold tree - level chpt form to deal with this problem , together with some assumptions about the relative size of the two unknown resonance decay constants . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this type of normalization procedure for a continuum spectral ansatz can involve potentially significant systematic errors .",
    "for example , in the scalar strange channel , it leads to a rather poor representation of the actual spectral function ( compare the model versions of refs .",
    "@xcite with that of ref .",
    "in addition , because both analyses employ borel transformed ( svz ) sum rules@xcite , they involve the conventional `` continuum '' ( or local duality ) approximation to @xmath35 above @xmath38 ( where the `` continuum threshold '' , @xmath39 , is a parameter of the analysis ) .",
    "since , for borel masses , @xmath40 , in the stability windows of both analyses , @xmath41 is far from being satisfied , there are potential systematic errors resulting from violations of local duality in the `` continuum '' region .",
    "( that contributions from the `` continuum '' region are not numerically negligible can also be inferred , e.g. , from the figures of ref .",
    "it is worth noting that violations of local duality are , in general , expected in kinematic regimes where typical resonance widths are comparable to or smaller than typical resonance separations . this has been quantified in the isovector vector channel , where the hadronic spectral function is known experimentally ; violations of local duality in that channel , even at scales @xmath42 , are seen to be , in general , rather large@xcite . taking the results from refs .",
    "@xcite which employ @xmath43 mev ( which best corresponds to recent experimental values for @xmath44@xcite ) , one finds , for @xmath6 , the values @xmath45 mev@xcite ( see figure 5 ) and @xmath46@xcite ( where the errors do not reflect the systematic uncertainties discussed above ) .",
    "the last approach involves the correlator , relevant to the strange scalar channel , @xmath47 which has been analyzed , in refs .",
    "@xcite , using the borel transformed sum rule method .",
    "this channel is a favorable one for sum rule analyses because the hadronic spectral function , @xmath35 , turns out to be rather well - determinable ( albeit indirectly ) from experimental data .",
    "the reason is that since , experimentally , @xmath48 scattering is known to be purely elastic up to @xmath49@xcite , the phase of the timelike scalar @xmath48 form factor , @xmath50 , is known up to this point .",

    "@xmath52 has been assumed to be @xmath53 ( or , equivalently , very slowly varying in the range of @xmath62 important to the analysis ) .",
    "the fact that , at the edge of the experimentally explored region , @xmath63 , the @xmath64 @xmath48 phase shift is very nearly @xmath65@xcite , the asymptotic value required if @xmath66 , suggests , first , that this assumption is rather plausible and , second , that the treatment of the high energy behavior of the phase , @xmath55 , employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 for @xmath68 , is sensible .",
    "we will also see below that , making these assumptions , one obtains extremely well - satisfied sum rules , providing strong _ post facto _ justification as well . with these assumptions ,",
    "the @xmath48 contribution to @xmath69 is completely determined , and multiparticle contributions begin only above @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting @xmath48 contribution to @xmath35 is , moreover , much smaller in the @xmath71 than in the @xmath72 region ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since the @xmath71 @xmath48 branching fraction is known to be @xmath73@xcite , the remaining multiparticle contributions to @xmath69 , in the @xmath71 region ,",
    "will also be small .",
    "this means that , to the extent that one may expect multiparticle contributions to @xmath69 to be resonance dominated , ( 1 ) such contributions will play only a small role in the full spectral function out to @xmath74 , and ( 2 ) in this region , the magnitude of these contributions can be obtained by combining information from the omnes - generated @xmath48 component and the known experimental @xmath71 @xmath48 branching fraction .",
    "we do not quote results from the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite since the spectral ansatz employed there has been shown to be incompatible with the omnes representation@xcite .",
    "results from refs .",
    "@xcite are @xmath75@xcite and @xmath76@xcite .",
    "the main potential uncertainty in these analyses is that associated with violations of local duality in the `` continuum '' region , @xmath77 .",
    "that continuum contributions are non - negligible may be seen from the lack of a stability plateau for @xmath6 in the analysis of ref .",
    "finite energy sum rules constructed using the extracted values of @xmath6 from refs .",
    "@xcite and the omnes - generated spectral ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite ( also used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as input have been shown to be moderately well satisfied@xcite .",
    "the residual deficiencies could arise from either shortcomings in the spectral ansatz or approximations on the ope side of the sum rules .",
    "we will investigate this question in what follows .",
    "unitarity and analyticity ensure that correlators like @xmath78 , defined above , satisfy either appropriately subtracted conventional dispersion relations or finite energy sum rules ( fesr s ) .",
    "borel transformation of the former leads to the conventional@xcite ( svz ) form of qcd sum rules .",
    "in what follows we choose to employ fesr s , which are based on cauchy s theorem , rather than the cauchy representation theorem , and work with the `` pac - man '' contour , which traverses both sides of the physical cut , and is closed by a circle of radius @xmath39 in the complex-@xmath62 plane .",
    "one then has @xmath79 valid for any function @xmath80 analytic in the region of the contour , where @xmath35 is the spectral function and @xmath81 the relevant physical threshold . to make this relation useful",
    ", one wishes to use the physical spectral function , whose extraction was described in the introduction , on the lhs , and the ope for the correlator on the rhs . since the ope is proportional to @xmath2 , this provides a method for extracting @xmath82 .    to make the results of this analysis reliable , @xmath39 should satisfy two criteria : ( 1 )",
    "it should be large enough to make the ope representation of the rhs accurate , and ( 2 ) it should be small enough that one still has experimental information on @xmath35 for @xmath83 on the lhs .",
    "the latter criterion , in the present case , restricts us to the region up to and including the @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath84 or so ) .",
    "since , even at @xmath85 , resonance widths and separations are comparable , one expects local duality to be violated , creating potentially significant uncertainties on the ope side .",
    "it has been argued , however , that even if local duality is not exactly satisfied for given timelike @xmath39 , the ope may , nonetheless , provide a good representation of the correlator on most of the circle @xmath86 ( i.e. , except possibly for a region of hadronic scale near the timelike real axis)@xcite .",
    "the isovector vector channel , for which the spectral function has been extracted from hadronic @xmath27 decay data , provides explicit empirical confirmation of this argument .",
    "first , the conventional fesr treatment of these decays@xcite is very well satisfied , presumably because it involves a weight function ( determined by kinematics ) with a double zero at @xmath38 which cuts out contributions from the potentially dangerous part of the contour .",
    "second , one may demonstrate that using weights @xmath87 ( with no such zero at @xmath38 ) leads to significant violation of local duality , even at scale @xmath88 , whereas fesr s based on weights having either a single or double zero at @xmath38 are all extremely well satisfied , even at scales significantly below @xmath88@xcite . using such fesr s one may ,",
    "thus , hope to construct sum rules in which the use of the `` continuum '' ansatz for the high energy portion of @xmath35 may be avoided . in what follows , therefore , we study fesr s for the correlator , @xmath78 , using weights of the form @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , @xmath90 is a free parameter , to be chosen in such a way as to optimize the reliability of the analysis .",
    "since ( 1 ) instanton effects are known exactly only in dilute gas single - instanton - background approximation@xcite and ( 2 ) the instanton density used to obtain these results is known to be altered by quark and gluon condensate effects@xcite , the magnitude of the resulting instanton contributions ( as stressed by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be considered only a rough guide .",
    "for this reason , we restrict our attention to weights which , after integration , yield instanton effects ( including corrections to the coefficients of both the unit operator and quark condensate in the ope , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which are small for all @xmath39 employed .",
    "while any @xmath91 turns out to satisfy this criterion , @xmath92 creates an optimal suppression and we will display results below for this value of @xmath90 .",
    "we now discuss the input on the hadronic side of the sum rules .",
    "the @xmath48 and multiparticle portions of @xmath35 are obtained , using the omnes representation , experimental @xmath48 phases , and the experimental @xmath48 branching fractions of the @xmath72 and @xmath71 , as described in the introduction .",
    "we employ two slightly different implementations of this procedure , the difference in the resulting @xmath6 values serving to quantify the effect of uncertainties in our knowledge of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "in the first implementation , the fit to the experimental @xmath48 phases obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is used as input to the omnes representation , and multiparticle contributions are allowed in both the @xmath72 and @xmath71 regions , constrained by the particle data group s @xmath48 branching fractions@xcite . in the second implementation we employ the lass fit@xcite to the @xmath48 phase shifts and inelasticities . for this fit , the form of the parametrization of phase shift data used is slightly different from that of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the fit to the @xmath48 amplitude is still purely elastic in the @xmath72 region , in employing this implementation we allow multiparticle contributions to the spectral function only from the @xmath71 region .",
    "( note that the background effective range parameters , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath72 resonance parameters , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , were mis - recorded in ref .",
