    "<S> we have studied bps vortices in a cpt - odd and lorentz - violating maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcsh ) electrodynamics attained from the dimensional reduction of the carroll - field - jackiw - higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz - violating parameter induces a pronounced behavior at origin ( for the magnetic / electric fields and energy density ) which is absent in the mcsh vortices . for some combination of the lorentz - violating coefficients there </S>",

    "<S> this interconnection was established since the seminal works by abrikosov @xcite and nielsen - olesen @xcite , which demonstrated the existence of electrically neutral vortices in type - ii superconducting systems and in field theory models , respectively .  since then </S>",
    "<S> , vortex solutions have become a theoretical field of increasing interest , reinforced with the works arguing the existence of bps ( bogomolnyi , prasad , sommerfeld ) solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bps vortices were found in the chern - simons - higgs model @xcite and in the maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcsh )  model @xcite , with additional investigations involving nonminimal coupling @xcite and other aspects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown the existence of generalized maxwell - higgs and chern - simons vortices @xcite in the context of k - field theories @xcite which have been a fertile environment for studying new topological defects solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of charged bps vortices in a generalized maxwell - chern - simons - higgs model was also demonstrated in ref . </S>",

    "<S> unusual vortex configurations in condensed matter systems , endowed with magnetic flux reversion @xcite and fractional quantization frac , have also caught attention in the latest years .    </S>",
    "<S> lorentz violating theories have been focus of strong interest since the proposal of the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite , whose gauge sector was intensively scrutinized in many respects km , klink , nm . the study of topological defects in lorentz - violating scenarios was initially conducted for scalar systems defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of monopole solutions in the presence of lorentz violation was regarded in the context of the carroll - field - jackiw electrodynamics monopole1 . </S>",
    "<S> topological defects were also examined in a broader framework of field theories endowed with tensor fields that spontaneously break the lorentz symmetry @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the lorentz - violating bps vortices are compactlike and could present fractional quantization of the magnetic flux . in a similar context , it was shown that the parity - odd sector of the cpt - even term @xmath2 allows the existence of electrically charged bps vortices in absence of the chern - simons term @xcite , endowed with magnetic flux reversion . </S>",
    "<S> the study of vortex configurations in lorentz - violating models has been an issue of active investigation recently @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we highlight the features of the corresponding bps solutions , which possess magnetic flux reversion : a remarkable feature induced by lorentz - violation which may find applications in some vortex systems of condensed matter physics @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> we thus start from a planar lorentz - violating maxwell - chern - simons model attained via the dimensional reduction of the cpt - odd maxwell - carroll - field - jackiw electrodynamics coupled to the higgs sector , examined in ref . @xcite . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec1 ] , we present the model and implement the bps formalism to attain the self - dual first order equations describing the topological vortices . in sec . </S>",

    "<S> also , the results of the numerical analysis are presented , revealing charged vortex profiles that recover the mcsh solutions in the asymptotic region , and may strongly differ from these ones near the origin . finally , in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec3 ] , we give our remarks and conclusions . </S>"
