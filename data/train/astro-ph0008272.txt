    "the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) of globular clusters show a great variety of horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies . it has long been known that the hb morphology tends to become bluer with decreasing cluster metallicity .",
    "however , the existence of pairs of globular clusters with the same metallicity but different hb morphologies shows that there must be at least one `` second parameter '' .",
    "theoretically , an increase in age is expected to reduce the envelope mass and thus yield a bluer hb morphology , _ provided that no other parameters are changing . _ if age _ is _ the second parameter , then there are profound consequences for models of the formation of the galactic halo ( e.g.  sarajedini et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the origin of the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  park & lee @xcite ) .",
    "however , much recent work indicates that age may not be the only or even the dominant second parameter controlling the hb morphology ( stetson et al .",
    "@xcite , ferraro et al .",
    "@xcite , catelan @xcite ) .",
    "fusi pecci et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the cluster density may influence the extension of the blue hb to rather faint magnitudes ( `` blue tail '' ) that is seen in the cmd s of many globular clusters , due to enhanced mass loss triggered by stellar interactions ( see also bailyn @xcite ) .    the clusters 47 tuc and ngc 362 are famous for their red hb morphologies .",
    "47 tuc is the prototype metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath30.71 ; harris @xcite ) red hb cluster , with only a single known rr lyr star ( v9 ; carney et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ngc 362 [ fe / h = @xmath31.16 ; harris @xcite ) is the red member of a famous second - parameter pair of clusters ( along with ngc 288 ) .",
    "thus it was a surprise when observations with the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) revealed the presence of 51 hot ( @xmath0  @xmath4 8500  k ) stars in the field of 47 tuc ( oconnell et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 84 hot stars within a radius of 825 from the center of ngc 362 ( dorman et al .",
    "although both 47  tuc and ngc  362 are located in projection on the outer halo of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , oconnell et al . and dorman et al .",
    "were able to show from the distribution with cluster radius that a significant fraction of the detected hot stars should be cluster members .",
    "independently , kaluzny et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) used optical photometry to identify eight candidate blue hb stars in 47  tuc ( all of which were detected with uit ) , but suggested from the absence of a radial gradient that most of these candidates were actually smc halo members .",
    "if the hot stars in ngc 362 and 47  tuc are hb stars and cluster members , then they should have the same age and metallicity as the majority red hb population , and might provide important clues to the other parameters that can yield blue hb stars in globular clusters .",
    "as noted above , not all the hot stars detected on the uit images are cluster hb stars . from the distribution of young stars in the outer halo of the smc mapped by gardiner & hatzidimitriou ( @xcite ) , we expect significant smc contamination of the hot stars in ngc 362 , whereas 47 tuc is located in a region mostly devoid of young stars in the northwest smc halo",
    ". some of the hot stars in ngc 362 and 47 tuc might also be extreme blue stragglers , analogous to those seen in the cores of ngc 6397 ( burgarella et al .",
    "@xcite ) and m3 ( ferraro et al .",
    "the temperatures of these blue stragglers can reach 12,000  k , and recent hst spectroscopy has confirmed that the mass of the two bright blue stragglers in the core of ngc 6397 exceeds twice the turnoff mass ( sepinsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    to reach any conclusions about these stars and their evolutionary status we need information about their atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature and surface gravity ) and also about their cluster membership . we therefore started a programme to obtain spectra of the hot hb star candidates in 47 tuc and ngc 362 .",
    "the radial velocities can be used to assess cluster membership , and the derived atmospheric parameters ( @xmath0  and @xmath1 ) can be used to distinguish hb stars from blue stragglers and background stars .",

    "there has been increasing interest in understanding the origin of the hot stars that can appear in old , metal - rich systems .",
    "the metal - rich open clusters ngc  6791 ( [ fe / h ] = + 0.4 ) and ngc  188 ( [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ) contain hot hb populations sufficiently large that the uv - turnup in their integrated cluster spectra would be as strong as that observed in elliptical galaxies ( landsman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . at these high metallicities , hot hb stars can be a natural product of single - star hb models ( e.g. dorman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although a significant fraction of the hot stars in the two clusters are binaries ( green et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the metal - rich bulge globular clusters , ngc  6388 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath30.60 , harris @xcite ) and ngc  6441 ( [ fe / h = @xmath30.53 , harris @xcite ) contain a sizable population of blue hb stars .",
    "a possible scenario for the blue hb in these clusters is a merger of two systems with different ages , with the blue hb arising from the minority old population ( yoon et al .",
    "however , this scenario does not explain several other peculiar aspects of the blue hb population in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , including the slope of the hb , and the gravities which are higher than predicted by canonical models ( moehler et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we have shown that at least some hot hb stars exist in the classical red hb clusters 47  tuc and ngc  362 , and ",
    "unlike the case of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441  they perfectly fit the expectations of canonical hb evolution .",
    "the three blue members in 47 tuc all have 10,000 k @xmath2 @xmath0@xmath2 15,000 k , and thus are well separated from the rest of the hb population , which is ( except for the single rr lyr v9 ) entirely redward of the instability strip .",
    "( a fourth probable hot star member of 47 tuc is uit-14 , which is only @xmath35 from the cluster center , and for which the iue spectrum obtained by oconnell et al .",
    "@xcite indicates @xmath0@xmath36 50,000  k. ) the small number of hot hb stars in 47  tuc , and their high temperatures , point to a scenario in which they have a different physical origin ( such as binary interactions ) than the dominant red hb population .",
    "it is suggestive that one of the hot stars in 47 tuc ( _ mj38529 _ ) appears to be a photometric binary , whose hot component could , however , also be an extreme blue straggler .",
    "interestingly , whereas ngc  362 has 14 bright blue stars within 14  radius of its center ( dorman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the inner 1  of 47 tuc probably does _ not _ contain any hot hb stars , as shown by observations with iue ( rich et al .",
    "@xcite ) , uit ( oconnell et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and wfpc2 ( rich et al .",
    "@xcite ) . rose & deng ( @xcite ) found that only about 7% of the mid - uv light in the core of 47  tuc comes from stars hotter than about 7,500  k ( most of which are probably blue stragglers ) .    the three hot hb stars in ngc  362 are somewhat cooler than those in 47  tuc , and the dominant hb in ngc  362 is not as red as that of 47  tuc .",
    "thus it is plausible that the blue hb stars in ngc  362 arise from a small percentage of red giants with unusually high mass loss , and no special mechanism is required for their production .",
    "unfortunately , the smc contamination is larger in ngc  362 than in 47  tuc , and five out of our eight targets turned out to be nonmembers",
    ". it would be interesting to study the stellar parameters of the hot stars in the core region , which we could not observe due to high crowding , but where the relative smc contamination should be much lower .",

    "<S> atmospheric parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , and radial velocities are derived for twelve candidate blue horizontal branch ( hb ) stars in the globular clusters 47  tuc and ngc  362 , which so far have been known to contain primarily red hb stars . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic targets were selected from the catalog of hot stars detected in these clusters at 1600    using the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic analyses of these stars reveal , however , that one of the four hb candidates targets in 47  tuc , and five out of the eight targets in ngc  362 are probably background stars belonging to the small magellanic cloud . with the exception of the photometric binary _ </S>",
    "<S> mj38529 _ in 47  tuc , the parameters of those stars that are probable members of 47  tuc and ngc  362 agree well with canonical hb evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the three hot stars in 47 tuc all have 10,000 k @xmath2 @xmath0@xmath2 15,000 k and include one photometric binary , which suggests that they might have a different physical origin than the dominant red hb population . the somewhat cooler blue hb stars in ngc  362 show more continuity with the dominant red hb population and might simply arise from red giants with unusually high mass loss . </S>"
