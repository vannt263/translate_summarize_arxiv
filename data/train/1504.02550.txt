    "describing an ecosystem is a problem of dimensionality reduction . given a community of billions of individuals , or millions of strains ,",
    "the challenge is to find a reduced set of degrees of freedom that could allow characterizing its properties or dynamics with an acceptable degree of accuracy .    ]",
    "the standard approach to this problem is through clustering .",
    "most commonly , the microscopic degrees of freedom , such as abundance of individual strains , are assumed to be located at the leaves of a tree ( based on phenotypic similarity , phylogenetics , etc . ) . a coarse - grained description",
    "is then constructed by choosing a transect cutting across this tree , and combining branches lying downstream of the transect ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) . for concreteness ,",
    "consider an example of combining just two leaves .",
    "imagine a community where a species of rabbits comes in two varieties that differ only slightly : say , a `` white '' rabbit @xmath0 and a `` brown '' rabbit @xmath1 ( fig .  [ fig:1]b ) .",
    "when describing their predator - prey dynamics with foxes , a two- or three - variable description could be used , depending on the desired level of detail .",
    "the comprehensive three - variable description might capture come subtle features , but for many questions , the classic lotka - volterra model , whereby the two varieties are clustered together into a single variable `` rabbits '' @xmath2 , would provide a sensible approximation : @xmath3    this work proposes a different perspective on the clustering operation  . to a first approximation , most environmental perturbations will affect the population of rabbits as a whole ; e.g.  an increase in predator efficiency , or habitat deterioration will depress the population of both varieties together . upon careful examination ,",
    "however , the small functional differences will manifest themselves on a slow timescale : for example , if the predator is better attuned to spotting a particular coat colour , one variety may eventually outcompete the other . in this way , compositional changes naturally align not with the lotka - volterra axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but with the rotated axes that provide an hierarchically - informed description : one variable @xmath4 ( `` rabbits '' ) that changes on a fast timescale , and another @xmath5 ( `` coat color '' ) that changes on a slow timescale .",
    "this work proposes to reinterpret fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b not as clustering , but as a change of basis , followed by the decision to ignore a slow - timescale variable .",
    "as we will see , an appropriately rotated basis can be constructed for an arbitrary population of interacting individuals , and can serve as a naturally hierarchical characterization of a community . borrowing the term introduced in  @xcite , one could call this the `` ecomode description '' .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a full individual - based description of a community : a list of all present organisms ( labelled by indices @xmath7 , @xmath8  ) and their functional characteristics .",
    "a general model for ecological dynamics can be written as a rule that associates to each individual @xmath7 a `` rate of abundance change '' @xmath9 : the probability per unit time with which it will either generate another individual ( @xmath10 ) or die ( @xmath11 ) . in a most general model ,",
    "this rate can depend on any detail of the community state , as well as on external environmental parameters denoted by @xmath12 : @xmath13 within any such model , we can define a matrix @xmath14 of interactions between individuals : @xmath15 is the effect that a hypothetical duplication of individual @xmath7 would have on the instantaneous division / death rate of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath16 importantly , here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are _ individuals _ , not species , and so the definition of @xmath14 does not require the partitioned community assumption . for the classic lotka - volterra scenario , the `` functional characteristics '' of an individual need only specify whether it is a fox or a rabbit , but we can allow this microscopic description to be arbitrarily detailed , down to the point of all individuals being unique .",
    "note that the interaction matrix @xmath14 is defined instantaneously ; the number of individuals and thus the size of @xmath14 can change in time .",
    "the primary focus of this work is the eigensystem of the interaction matrix @xmath14 . for a population of @xmath17 individuals",
    ", this @xmath18 matrix will always have @xmath17 eigenvalues .",
    "note , however , that if individuals @xmath7 and @xmath19 happen to be functionally identical , then @xmath20 for all @xmath8 , and @xmath21 has a zero eigenvalue . for a coarse model ascribing all individuals to only @xmath22 distinct phenotypes",
    ", the matrix @xmath14 will be highly degenerate with only @xmath23 non - trivial eigenvalues ; the remaining @xmath24 will be strictly zero .",
    "a detailed functional description recognizing all individuals as unique will remove the degeneracy ; however , if the partitioning into @xmath23 categories were indeed a good approximation , @xmath24 eigenvalues will remain small ( here and everywhere , characterizing an eigenvalue as `` small '' refers to its absolute value ) .",
    "we are led to hypothesize that the spectrum of @xmath14 may provide a naturally hierarchical description of ecological relationships in a community , with progressively smaller eigenvalues resolving finer and finer details .",
    "the grouping of individuals into discrete types , when it exists , is established as a result of this analysis ; in this framework , it no longer constitutes a fundamental assumption .",
    "in the interest of full generality , the definition of the previous section was explicitly individual - based .",
    "the existence of such a definition is a very important feature of the eigenmode framework ; however , the inconvenience of dealing with discrete individuals is a technical nuisance that could obscure the larger points in the subsequent discussion . to build intuition about the eigenmode perspective",
    ", the best approach is to illustrate it on simple examples .",
    "the most familiar setting is that of a generalized lotka - volterra model , with @xmath23 continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "its linearized dynamics in the vicinity of an equilibrium point take the form : @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes the deviation from equilibrium abundance , and the index @xmath27 runs from 1 to @xmath23 . for simplicity ,",
    "this is the context that will be used for most of the discussion . positing",
    "a finite number of @xmath23 interacting phenotypes may seem to contradict the stated goal of avoiding the `` species '' partitioning .",
    "however , the reader is invited to think of these phenotypes not as a `` species '' label , but as a microscopic , sub - species description ; e.g.  interacting bacterial strains that may or may not group into species . in this context ,",
    "the variable - size individual interaction matrix @xmath14 has only @xmath23 non - trivial eigenvalues and eigenvectors , which correspond to the eigensystem of the lotka - volterra interaction matrix @xmath28 ( see the supplementary material ; sm ) .",
    "the eigenvalues have units of inverse time and correspond to the relaxation time scales of perturbations applied along each eigenmode .    in order to make the eigenmodes interpretable , rather than positing the interaction matrix @xmath28 in some arbitrary manner ,",
    "it is extremely helpful to construct it from a functional description of what these phenotypes do ( recall the example above , where the @xmath29 axis could be conveniently interpreted as `` rabbits '' and @xmath30 as `` coat color '' ) .",
    "one simple way to do this is provided by the macarthur model of resource competition  @xcite , where phenotypes are characterized by the resources they are able to consume .",
    "this defines a particular instance of a competitive lotka - volterra model , while also giving us an intuition for phenotypic similarity , and a functional interpretation for the eigenmodes we will observe .    specifically , following ref .",
    "@xcite , consider a well - mixed microbial community in a medium where a single limiting element ( e.g.  carbon ) exists in @xmath31 forms ( `` resources '' @xmath32 ; in what follows @xmath33 ) .",
    "each resource can be metabolized with a dedicated `` pathway '' .",
    "the phenotypes are defined by two pieces of information : first , their requirement for the limiting element , and second , the pathways they carry .",
    "the former will be randomly drawn for simplicity , but the latter will be chosen strategically , by hand , in order to construct the most instructive examples .",
    "the set of @xmath23 phenotypes defines a @xmath23-by-@xmath31 binary matrix @xmath34 of pathway presence / absence ( @xmath35 if phenotype @xmath27 carries the pathway enabling it to consume resource @xmath36 ) , and this matrix @xmath34 determines the phenotype - phenotype interactions .",
    "specifically , the competition between a pair of phenotypes @xmath37 is the stronger , the larger the overlap in their resource preference @xmath38 . under macarthur s model",
    ", such competition always results in a unique and stable equilibirum  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical details are provided in the sm , but for the discussion that follows , this description should already be sufficient .",
    "for the first example , consider a community composed of phenotypes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a , competing for 20 resources supplied in equal abundance .",
    "these 12 phenotypes were purposefully generated to form three clear clusters ( see sm for the exact procedure ; matlab scripts ( mathworks , inc . ) reproducing all examples and figures are available as supplementary file  1 ) .",
    "this community can be interpreted as harbouring three species ; within each species , phenotypes share a core set of pathways ( indicated ) and differ only in a small subset , similar to the `` core '' and `` accessory genome '' of a species  @xcite .",
    "how is this scenario seen from the eigenmode perspective ?",
    "resource competition between these phenotypes defines a 12-by-12 interaction matrix .",
    "its eigenmode spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b .",
    "each eigenvector is a linear combination of phenotypes , and is difficult to interpret .",
    "however , since each phenotype is defined by its resource consumption , their linear combination can be conveniently characterized in the same way : the pathway presence / absence matrix @xmath34 can be used to project each eigenvector into the pathway expression space ( fig .  [",
    "fig:2]c ) .",
    "this provides a functional interpretation for the eigenmodes : each row in the matrix shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c indicates how the community - level pathway expression changes if its composition is perturbed in the direction of a given eigenmode .",
    "we observe that the spectrum is dominated by 3 modes , whose projections in the pathway expression space are linear combinations of the `` core genomes '' of the three phenotype clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c , top 3 rows ) .",
    "this indicates that at the short timescale , the response of the system to a perturbation can be well approximated using only 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "above , characterizing this habitat as `` harbouring 3 species '' was an interpretation that relied on a subjective judgement of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a by a human observer .",
    "the eigenmode spectrum contains this information , and more , in an objective format , decomposing community dynamics over a range of time scales .",
    "the first eigenvector is a collective mode , with each entry close to @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the statement that , if we insisted on reducing the community to a single degree of freedom , our best choice would be to say that all resources are being consumed at a certain overall rate . however , this is a poor approximation ; capturing the dominant fast dynamics requires 3 degrees of freedom . far below the dominating eigenvalues",
    ", a fourth one becomes apparent ( arrowhead ) .",
    "examining the fourth row in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c and comparing it to panel a reveals that this mode corresponds to a finer structure within the first cluster , where coexisting variants differ in their ability to consume resources 1 and 2 .",
    "the eigenmode decomposition provides a way to describe dynamics with increasing level of detail ; smaller differences manifest themselves as smaller eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the eigenmode description of community structure is naturally hierarchical .        the key property of the eigenmode spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b is the existence of a noticeable _ gap _ in its spectrum , which provides a justifiable cutoff point for the number of degrees of freedom to include into a low - dimensional description ( note that in some contexts , the term `` spectral gap '' is used in a narrower sense to describe the difference between specifically the first and second eigenvalues ; this is not the meaning adopted here ) . whenever an ecosystem exhibits a spectral gap",
    ", one could define the effective number of species as the number of dominant eigenvalues .",
    "importantly , however , the spectral gap need not be unique , and is a fluid property : under a continuous change of parameters , gaps can move , appear and disappear .",
    "the next example explores the implications of this fact .",
    "consider now a community of 11 phenotypes of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a . for equiabundant resources ,",
    "we observe the expected `` 2-species '' spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) , the dominant eigenmodes reflecting the two `` core genomes '' that correspond to the dominating binary clustering pattern .",
    "however , by construction ( see sm for details ) , each of these phenotypes specializes in only one of the first three resources .",
    "if the supply of these resources is strongly increased , this preference will become the more relevant clustering criterion ; the same 11 phenotypes now behave as a community of 3 effective species ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]d ) .",
    "note that in this regime , the eigenmode corresponding to the binary clustering ( which used to be mode # 2 ) is again part of the spectrum ( now as mode # 4 ) , but is characterized by a much smaller eigenvalue , signaling much slower dynamics than those governed by the dominant three resources .",
    "both these extremes were easy to interpret , but how should we think of the regime lying in between ( fig .  [ fig:3]c ) ?",
    "a smooth process leading to a change in the number of species may seem familiar from the study of speciation .",
    "one cluster of phenotypes can be smoothly separated into two , and if we insisted on counting species , then somewhere in between there must be a gray area of `` more than one , but less than two '' .",
    "this inability to draw a hard threshold of exactly when two close varieties should be considered distinct species is not , however , a significant challenge to the species paradigm .",
    "whether a finer subdivision is warranted is merely a question of the desired level of detail .",
    "this was already illustrated in the previous example : the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b exhibits two significant gaps , leaving us the choice of characterizing it with either three or four degrees of freedom . and just as in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , subjecting the community of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a to an increased abundance of resources 1 and 2 would reduce the first spectral gap , making the finer ( 4-species ) description increasingly more justifiable . in this scenario ,",
    "the origin of our inability to define an exact number of species is well understood",
    ".    however , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows that the problem is more general .",
    "the somewhat artificial example of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a was purposefully constructed to show that a smooth change of parameters can interpolate between two clustering patterns even when they are entirely unrelated ( not nested ) : the same 11 phenotypes are grouped as \\{15 } , \\{611 } in one case ( panel b ) , and \\{1 ,  6 } , \\{2 ,  710 } , \\{35 ,  11 } in the other ( panel d ) .",
    "the `` gray area '' in between is of a different nature than the uncertainty about whether to further subdivide a particular cluster .",
    "this suggests that the intermediate regime of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c should be interpreted not as `` two and a half species '' , but rather as a situation where a gap - less spectrum means that the effective number of species can not be defined at all .",
    "characterizing such a `` regime without species '' is indeed our ultimate destination .",
    "unfortunately , this particular example suffers from an obvious problem : it was constructed within a lotka - volterra framework with 11 degrees of freedom . whether or not they can be grouped into clusters , such a model can always be seen as describing an interacting system of 11 species .",
    "this issue is a consequence of the decision , made early on , to work within the familiar lotka - volterra context .",
    "no simple lotka - volterra model can generate a truly gap - less spectrum : as discussed above , a model grouping individuals into @xmath23 discrete categories always has a gap separating the @xmath23 non - trivial eigenvalues from the vast number of those that are strictly zero , as a consequence of the partitioning assumption .",
    "similarly , _",
    "virtually all classical ecological models describe systems whose eigenvalue spectrum exhibits a prominent gap . _",
    "what reasons do we have to believe that natural ecosystems , e.g. the microbial communities inhabiting our intestines , possess this property",
    "? absent such evidence , we must acknowledge that spectral gaps , whose existence is a prerequisite for a low - dimensional `` species - based '' description to be adequate , could be an artifact of familiar theoretical models , and not necessarily the best approximation of ecological reality .",
    "if one could build an ecosystem model whose spectrum really did exhibit no gaps , such a scenario fundamentally could not be conceptualized as a system of interacting species .",
    "one signature of this regime is that any attempt to approximate it with a @xmath23-dimensional lotka - volterra model will appear to contain exactly @xmath23 species , for any @xmath23 .",
    "the next section will construct one concrete example exhibiting this behavior .",
    "constructing an ecosystem with a dense spectrum requires a model where the number of distinct phenotypes can be arbitrarily large",
    ". it would be convenient to also maintain two useful features of the previous examples : a functional characterization of phenotypes , and the existence of a stable equilibrium . finally , to underscore the interpretation of this scenario as a regime `` without species ''",
    ", we will set an additional objective , requiring the set of coexisting phenotypes to be unstructured , so that no grouping is privileged .",
    "ideally , then , we would like to have a model where an arbitrarily large , unstructured set of functionally defined phenotypes can co - exist at a stable equilibrium .    in the classic ( well - mixed ) framework of macarthur",
    ", @xmath31 resources can stably sustain at most @xmath31 phenotypes  @xcite .",
    "however , imagine a spatially structured habitat with @xmath40 patches , whose boundaries are permeable to resources , but not to organisms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a ) .",
    "the mathematical details of this model are provided in the supplement ; however , qualitatively , the behavior is intuitive . at infinite permeability ( resources",
    "are exchanged freely ) , the @xmath40 patches are effectively a single patch , and we are back to the classic macarthur model . if permeability is zero , the @xmath40 isolated patches can sustain up to @xmath41 phenotypes , but these have no interactions across patch boundaries . at intermediate permeability , we find the desired situation where the interactions are nontrivial , and yet the total number of coexisting phenotypes can be arbitrarily large . although the number of distinct binary vectors is bounded by @xmath42 , two phenotypes located in different patches count as distinct even if their pathway content is identical , because they interact differently with other phenotypes ( for example , of the two `` red - blue '' phenotypes in the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a , one has a strong competitor in the same patch , but the other does not ) .    for each patch",
    ", define an independent pool of local phenotypes that is fully random ( each phenotype carries or not a given pathway with probability 1/2 ) .",
    "after the system equilibrates , the total number of coexisting phenotypes is of order @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig:4]b shows the complete interaction matrix for 298 phenotypes in @xmath43 patches ( see sm for details ) .",
    "predictably , phenotypes group by patch : at weak resource permeability , organisms interact more strongly within a patch than they do across patches . however , the pathway content of these phenotypes is , by construction , completely unstructured .",
    "these observations are reflected in the eigenmode structure .",
    "@xmath40 eigenvalues clearly stand out in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c ) , reflecting the patch structure : at the very top , we recognize the collective mode ; the remaining @xmath44 modes are pairwise differences between the collective modes of the individual patches .",
    "these dominant modes are followed by a dense spectrum of eigenvalues , whose distribution exhibits no gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]d ) : aside from the patch structure , no grouping of phenotypes is in any way privileged , offering no possibility for a coarse - grained description .    in order to take the limit @xmath45 , consider now the projection of the eigenvectors into the @xmath31-dimensional expression space .",
    "this corresponds to adopting the perspective of an observer who can measure the community - wide expression of metabolic pathways , but can not resolve individual patches .",
    "such an observer can see the dominant collective mode , but modes 2 through @xmath40 are effectively hidden : their projection into the pathway expression space has vanishingly small components ( panel  c ) . to understand this , consider a perturbation where all phenotypes in patch 1 experience an increase in abundance , and all phenotypes in patch 2 , a decrease .",
    "such a perturbation will relax quickly , corresponding to one of the dominant ( strongly negative ) eigenvalues . however , the internal dynamics represented by this mode is effectively hidden from an outside observer whose measurements do not resolve individual patches .",
    "such an observer can only see a unique collective mode over a fully unstructured background ( modes from @xmath46 onwards ) : a dense spectrum , whose shape is independent of @xmath40 .",
    "this characterization allows sending @xmath40 to infinity .",
    "this limit is proposed as a tractable model case of an `` ecology without species '' . in this regime ,",
    "the number of interacting phenotypes becomes infinite , their pathway content is unstructured , and the spectrum is dense ; yet this construct continues to describe a valid ecology at equilibrium whose properties could be investigated .",
    "for instance , if the supply of some resource is increased , this system will have some well - defined response , which our hypothetical observer could measure and could attempt to predict .",
    "what is the utility of this regime ?",
    "the extreme , fully unstructured case is certainly a poor approximation of any natural setting .",
    "however , it provides a baseline that can be perturbed to describe novel scenarios of `` weakly structured '' ecologies , as illustrated in the next and final example .",
    "d ) . [ fig:5 ] ]    fig .  [ fig:5 ] repeats the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , with one exception : the first and last pathway are forbidden from ever appearing within the same organism .",
    "specifically , for each patch , the procedure generating the local phenotype pool was modified as follows : each entry in the pathway presence matrix @xmath34 was independently set to 1 with probability 1/2 as before , but whenever this resulted in a phenotype carrying the forbidden pathway pair , this phenotype was removed from the pool .",
    "this kind of structure is not implausible : a detrimental cross - talk between certain pathways can make their simultaneous activity in the same organism difficult ; for example , the enzyme nitrogenase is inactivated by oxygen and thus must be kept separate from oxygen - utilizing pathways .",
    "the spectrum of this ecosystem , projected into the pathway expression space , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c , we see that there are now two modes that stand out from the gap - less background .",
    "in addition to mode # 1 ( the collective mode ) , there is now also mode # @xmath47 that represents the only perturbation imposed on an otherwise unstructured phenotype background . the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a was computed for one particular random realization of a system with @xmath43 patches ; however , as @xmath40 is increased , the projection of this mode into pathway space and its position in the spectrum both remain invariant ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that the fully unstructured regime constructed here can indeed be meaningfully perturbed to describe the dynamics of `` weakly structured '' ecologies , an interesting theoretical scenario that was previously out of reach .    to maintain consistency with the previous examples ,",
    "the approach taken here focused exclusively on resource competition .",
    "the `` hidden '' modes corresponding to unobservable inter - patch dynamics is the price to pay for this simplicity .",
    "other approaches are possible ; one might , for instance , imagine constructing a dense - spectrum model by means of a fully individual - based description , or through a sequence of iterative subdivisions of a lotka - volterra model ( similar to the approach taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , but repeated an infinite number of times ) .",
    "one of these methods might yield a more elegant construction ; however , the multi - patch example constructed here has the advantage of being easily interpretable , and potentially even analytically tractable with methods developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of the `` eigenmode approach '' described here is very simple .",
    "anyone familiar with the principle component analysis ( pca ) has encountered the problem of choosing the number of components on which to focus . in rare circumstances , a few components are sufficient to capture most of the variance ; the generic situation ,",
    "however , is that the spectrum shows no obvious gap , offering no natural truncation point  @xcite .",
    "normally , one thinks of the pca modes as linear combinations of the fundamental degrees of freedom , namely the species abundances . here , the novelty is to ask whether the eigenmodes could be used as the fundamental degrees of freedom themselves .",
    "even if the concept of species is not called into question , the eigenmodes provide a naturally hierarchical description which allows asking new questions .",
    "are there general laws governing the structure and evolution of community spectra ? what ecological mechanisms might cause a given eigenvector to change in a predictable way , or a cause a given eigenvalue to become more prominent ?",
    "how is the spectrum affected by evolutionary mechanisms ?",
    "one may , for example , expect that purifying selection encourages the development of spectral gaps , while diversity - creating mutations have the opposite effect .",
    "a major advance in classical physics came with the development of the renormalization group , a framework explaining why many physical systems , as they become large , do in fact develop a gap in the spectrum , enabling some low - dimensional `` effective theory '' to become an excellent description  @xcite . ecology and evolution provide a new context for asking similar questions , which are particularly relevant today with the study of highly diverse microbial ecosystems of medical and environmental interest  @xcite .",
    "the eigenmode formalism admits the possibility that , for a given ecosystem , the most relevant degrees of freedom may take a different form than simply the combined abundance of some taxa . as a simplest example ,",
    "imagine a two - species consortium @xmath48 , @xmath49 that runs the same metabolic reaction that species @xmath50 performs alone . in this scenario ,",
    "the combination @xmath51 might be a functionally `` negligible '' ( slow ) eigenmode , but the reduction of dimensionality this observation affords does note reduce to simple branch - merging on a phylogenetic tree .",
    "situations when one diverse set of species is essentially interchangeable with another diverse set are likely the rule , rather than an exception , as evidenced by the dramatic compositional variations of human - associated microbiota across healthy individuals , at all taxonomic levels  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the number of negligible eigenmodes may indeed be large , and recognizing them could simplify the task of modelling these communities even within the traditional species - based framework",
    ".    however , more profoundly , the perspective developed here allows conceptualizing a novel scenario of an `` ecology without species '' .",
    "the classic lotka - volterra model investigates an ecology of perfectly defined species , a regime that has been studied extensively .",
    "this work presented a theoretical construct that can be seen as the opposite extreme , one where the phenotypes are completely unstructured , and yet form a valid ecology .",
    "in any real setting , organisms sharing a recent common ancestor are functionally similar , and the approximation `` every single organism is unlike any other '' is even more extreme than the converse assumption of perfect clustering into a small number of species . nevertheless ,",
    "a theoretical investigation of this unstructured regime will likely be a valuable step towards understanding the middle ground occupied by the real - life communities ; in physical terms , its role would be to provide a different origin for a perturbative expansion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idea ] ) .",
    "for example , in condensed matter physics it was recently proposed that a granular medium at the brink of a jamming transition can be thought of as a `` maximally disordered '' solid , the opposite extreme of a perfectly ordered crystal  @xcite .",
    "importantly , it was shown that certain properties of real - life solids , even at relatively low disorder , can be more adequately described as a perturbation of this `` maximally disordered '' regime , rather than as a perturbation of a perfect crystal  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is intriguing to hypothesize that some behaviors of highly diverse natural ecosystems may be better described as a perturbation of a fully unstructured no - species regime ( adding some tendency of phenotypes to cluster ) , rather than as a small deviation from the classic picture of well - clustered species ( where we attempt to recognize that species boundaries are `` fuzzy '' ) .",
    "this approach would provide a systematic framework to investigate the implications of `` structured '' and `` unstructured '' variation imposed at a range of scales , effects whose importance at the intraspecific level was recently highlighted  @xcite .",
    "the eigenmode formalism is by no means limited to resource competition models ; macarthur s model merely provided a convenient setting for constructing easily interpretable examples .",
    "the framework described here does , however , suffer from a number of other limitations : for example , only deterministic dynamics were considered , and the discussion was restricted to small fluctuations around some ecological state .",
    "nevertheless , the question raised here was whether our description of ecosystems could move beyond the inherently discrete concept of a `` species '' . in light of this challenge ,",
    "the simplifications above provide a reasonable starting point .",

    "the ecological dynamics remain identical to those of a single - patch macarthur s model described above .",
    "the coupling between patches manifests itself only in the magnitudes of resource influx experienced by each patch .",
    "the global external supply @xmath113 is evenly split between all @xmath40 patches ; however , each patch may experience additional influx or outflux depending on the resource uptake efficiency of its local community .    specifically ,",
    "if @xmath114 labels patches , define @xmath115 as the _ average _ resource availability across all patches : @xmath116 patches where the availability ( concentration ) of resource @xmath36 is lower than @xmath117 experience a net influx of this resource from other patches , where the availability is higher .",

    "[ fig:4 ] , at each patch , a local pool of random 200 competitors for 20 resources was generated ( at each patch , the pathway presence matrix was a random binary matrix of size 200-by-20 , each entry set to 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 ) .",

    "<S> this approach reduces to the familiar species - based perspective when it applies , but remains well - defined even when the species description breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea behind this formalism is that species clustering can be reinterpreted as a special form of a more general operation , namely a change of basis in the compositional space . </S>"
