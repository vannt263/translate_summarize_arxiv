    "let us elucidate how some important features of the consideration above are seen in the brane picture . to this end",

    "the ns5 branes can be split in the @xmath215 direction which corresponds to the introduction of the fayet - iliopoulos term in the u(1 ) factor of u(@xmath1 ) , namely , @xmath216    the higgs branch in this theory occurs when the d6 branes touch the d4 branes . after this",
    ", the d4 branes can split in pieces which can be moved in the ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) directions .",
    "the coordinates of these pieces in in the ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) directions , along with the wilson line of @xmath217 , yield coordinates on the higgs branch of the moduli space .",
    "fluctuations of the ends of the d4 branes in the @xmath218 plane provide the coordinates on the coulomb branch of the moduli space .    to break @xmath11susy down to @xmath12we rotate one of the ns5 branes .",
    "the angle of rotation corresponds to the mass of the adjoint scalar in the superpotential ( [ superpotbr ] ) .",
    "the fact that this superpotential does not vanish removes the coulomb branch of the moduli space .",
    "the positions of the d4 branes in the ( 4,5 ) plane are now fixed .",
    "now , let us switch on the meson field @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that it emerges as a particular limiting brane configuration in the setup described above , without any additional branes .",
    "consider the situation when the @xmath214 coordinates of all d6 branes are the same .",
    "first , in this limit the open strings connecting the pairs of the d6 branes yield a massless field which is in the adjoint representation with respect to the _ flavor _ group u(@xmath219 . in the field - theory language",
    "this is nothing but our @xmath16 field .",
    "taking into account the standard three - string vertex we immediately derive the superpotential @xmath220 . on the other hand ,",
    "since all d6 branes have the same @xmath214 coordinate , it is impossible to split the pieces of the d4 branes  such a splitting would require different values of @xmath214 for the pair of the d6 branes .",
    "thus , the higgs branch disappears .",
    "we see that in the brane language the introduction of the @xmath16 field is in one - to - one correspondence with the disappearance of the higgs branch .",
    "consider now the evolution of the monopoles discussed in sect .",
    "[ evol ] within the framework of the brane picture . in the @xmath11theory in the regime ( [ stage1 ] )",
    "the monopole is represented by a d2 brane stretched between two ns5 branes in the @xmath214 direction and two d4 branes located at @xmath221 and @xmath222 , which yields the correct monopole mass @xmath223    switching on the fayet - iliopoulos parameter parameter @xmath69 in the regime ( [ stage2 ] ) corresponds to a displacement of one of the ns5 branes in the @xmath215 direction . since the d4 branes split in two pieces at the common @xmath214 coordinate where the d6 branes are located , and each piece is attached to the ns5 brane , a squark condensate develops .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath224 .",
    "this regime supports quasiclassical non - abelian strings which have a transparent geometrical interpretation @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian strings are identified with the d2 brane parallel to the d6 branes stretched between two ns5 branes along the @xmath215 coordinate .",
    "geometrically , the string tension equals @xmath225 , in full agreement with the field - theory result .",
    "the d2 brane representing the monopole in the higgs phase is located as follows .",
    "it extends along two coordinates , @xmath214 and @xmath226 . along the @xmath214",
    "coordinate the d2 brane is stretched between the common position of the d6 branes and the ns5 brane . in the @xmath226 direction it is stretched between two d4 branes .    from this picture",
    "one immediately recognizes the monopole to be a junction of two non - abelian strings since it is stretched between two different non - abelian strings in the @xmath226 direction . if one switches off the fayet  iliopoulos term then the monopole in the higgs phase geometrically smoothly transforms into the t hooft  polyakov monopole .",
    "this picture implies that in the semiclassical regime of large @xmath181 the monopole mass is the same as the mass of the t hooft  polyakov monopole . with @xmath181 decreasing",
    "we eventually find ourselves in the purely quantum regime described by lifting type iia string to m - theory and , hence , lifting the d2 brane to m2 brane . in m - theory",
    "the monopole in the higgs phase can be easily described by the m2 brane wrapping the appropriate circle on the riemann surface , using its identification with the kink in cp(@xmath193 ) model @xcite .    finally in the regime ( [ stage4 ] ) we rotate one of the ns5 branes which results in vanishing vacuum expectation values of the adjoint scalars .",
    "however , the m2 brane representing the non - abelian string is still clearly identified .",
    "the monopoles are the m2 branes wrapped around the riemann surface responsible for this regime upon rotation of the branes .",
    "let us emphasize that the monopoles in all regimes are represented by the m2 branes , and their evolution from the coulomb branch to the higgs one corresponds just to different placement of one and the same brane in a certain brane background .",
    "note that the brane picture suggests the possibility of a more general situation , when only @xmath227 of the d6 branes have the same @xmath214 coordinates .",
    "then , the massless meson field m belongs to the u@xmath228 subgroup of the flavor group . in particular",
    ", one can consider the case @xmath111 , introduce a meson field of some rank and perform the standard seiberg duality transformation by exchanging two ns5 branes .",
    "let us summarize our findings .",
    "deformation of @xmath11sqcd leads us to the @xmath16 model , @xmath12sqcd supplemented by the @xmath16 field , see ( [ mmodel ] ) .",
    "we observe confined non - abelian monopoles in this model which has no monopoles whatsoever in the semiclassical limit .",

    "this is the main result of the present paper .",
