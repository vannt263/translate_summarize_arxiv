    "iron - based oxides have very interesting properties due to the different oxidation states of fe , which give rise to different crystal structures and stoichiometries .",
    "well known examples are feo and fe@xmath2 where fe can exist in fe@xmath3 and fe@xmath4 states , respectively .",
    "all these materials are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or ferrimagnetic ( fim ) insulators .",
    "fe - containing ferroelectric oxides are currently attracting tremendous attention , not only due to their magnetic properties but also due to their applications .",
    "particularly , those oxides that exhibit magnetic and ferroelectric characteristics simultaneously , known as multiferroics , can have practical device applications such as spin transistor memories , whose magnetic properties can be tuned by electric fields through the lattice strain effect.@xcite a lot of work has been done on perovskite materials to understand the origins of multiferroic behavior .",
    "@xcite perovskite materials containing fe , e.g. , bifeo@xmath0@xcite and srfeo@xmath0 ( sfo )  @xcite , have very complicated magnetic structures that promote such type of behaviors.@xcite in cubic sfo , which is afm and metallic down to low temperatures@xcite , fe is surrounded by six o atoms and it is in the fe@xmath5 state .",
    "sfo is of particular interest due to its simple crystal structure and helical magnetic structure .",
    "recently , the helical spin order in fe perovskites has been investigated using a double exchange ( de ) model including oxygen @xmath6 orbitals.@xcite in particular , it was found that g - type helical magnetic structure could be changed to a - type by reducing the superexchange ( se ) interactions .",
    "@xcite    another example of perovskites is bafeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) , which is one of the few oxides where iron has an oxidation state of + 4.@xcite in bulk , bfo normally assumes a hexagonal crystal structure , although various polymorphs have been observed with oxygen deficiency.@xcite bulk hexagonal bfo exhibits an interesting afm to fm transition at 160 k.@xcite recent experiments observed however ferromagnetism in cubic bfo , where the metastable cubic structure was shown to be stable down to @xmath7k,@xcite and a field - induced switching from afm to fm .",
    "bfo has also spin spiral magnetic order , but it is different from that of sfo . as a consequence , sfo needs larger external fields than bfo for the afm to fm transition .",
    "et al._@xcite have grown epitaxially cubic bfo on sto and found week ferromagnetism with a transition temperature of 235 k. similarly , matsui _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have also reported ferromagnetic ( fm ) in pseudocubic bfo on sto .",
    "very recently , li _ et al._@xcite used dft@xmath1 to investigate the helical structure of cubic fm bfo and sfo and found afm to fm transitions under external pressure . the structural fm stability of cubic bfo has also been studied experimentally and it was found that cubic bfo remains fm up to 40 gpa.@xcite the magnetic structure of bfo can also be tuned by external small magnetic field ( 0.3 t).@xcite such experimental and theoretical results indicate that magnetic phase transitions ( afm to fm ) can easily be affected by external perturbations . motivated by this recent experimental work on cubic bfo , here",
    "we demonstrate that this bfo structure shows fm to afm / fim phase transitions due to jahn - teller(jt ) type distortions , which can be used to engineer bfo for applications .",
    "we performed calculations in the framework of density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite using linear combinations of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) as implemented in the siesta code  @xcite .",
    "we used a double-@xmath8 polarized ( dzp ) basis set for all atoms .",
    "we employed both the local density approximation ( lda ) as parametrized by ceperly and adler , @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as parametrized by wu and cohen @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we used standard norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite in their fully nonlocal form .",
    "@xcite we carefully checked the convergence of the cutoff energy for the real - space grid , since the lattice parameters and magnetic moments in this system were rather sensitive to this parameter .",
    "this energy cutoff defines the energy of the most energetic plane wave that can be represented on such grid , i.e. , the larger the cutoff the smaller the separation between points in the grid ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a reciprocal vector and @xmath11 is the separation between points ) .",
    "we found that 400 ry was enough to converge the lattice parameters and magnetic moments .",
    "similarly , we performed the brillouin zone integrations using different monkhorst - pack grids .",
    "we found that the magnetic moments and lattice parameters were converged with a @xmath12 mesh . with such optimized computational parameters",
    ", we obtained @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the the lda and gga lattice constants @xmath15 , respectively , which are comparable to the experimental lattice constant , @xmath16 @xcite or @xmath17  .",
    "@xcite using such optimized lattice constants , we obtained magnetic moments per fe atom of 3.40 @xmath18 and 3.58 @xmath18 for lda and gga , respectively , which are also comparable to the experimentally determined magnetic moment @xmath19 @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite    we performed the lda@xmath1 and gga@xmath1 calculations with the lda and gga calculated lattice constants . in order to determine the influence of different @xmath20 s and cutoff radii and see how the results compare to previous experiments and calculations",
    ", we studied first the typical case of bulk oxide feo , @xcite where dft is known to give qualitatively different behavior ( metallic instead of insulating character)@xcite .",
    "we performed calculations with @xmath21 ev and @xmath22 ev , which is the range of values most used in the literature for iron @xcite , and used projectors with different radii .",
    "the parameters that best fitted the experiments and previous calculations for feo were , @xmath23 ev and @xmath24 bohr for gga@xmath1 , and @xmath22 ev and @xmath25 bohr for lda@xmath1 , which gave a gap of approximately @xmath26 ev .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the previous value of 2 .. 4 ev given in ref . .",
    "the quantitative and qualitative agreement of our lda / gga and lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 results with previous theoretical and experimental works guarantees the computational approach used in the present study .",
    "we carried out total energy calculations of cubic bfo in nonmagnetic ( nm ) , fm , and afm states",
    ". we will only discuss gga@xmath1 data , but comparison with lda@xmath1/lda / gga will be made wherever necessary .",
    "we found that at ambient pressure bfo has a fm ground state .",
    "figure  [ dosfm ] shows the calculated total and projected density of states ( pdos ) .",
    "the electronic structure of bfo shows typical half metallic behavior , which has important applications in spin based electronic devices ( spintronics ) .",
    "strong bonding of fe @xmath27-o @xmath28 orbitals can be seen around the fermi energy both in the majority and minority spin states .",
    "the @xmath27-o @xmath28 hybridization is essential for ferromagnetism and can be perturbed either by external pressure or by distorting the local environment around the fe atoms .",
    "two sharp peaks , contributed by @xmath27 electrons , in the valence spin - up and conduction spin - down states can be seen .",
    "this calculated electronic structure is agreement with the recent work of li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite it is important to mention that our calculated lda / gga electronic structures showed metallic behavior , which is also in agreement with the previous dft calculations .",
    "@xcite we therefore believe that including an optimum value of @xmath20 is essential to describe the true electronic structure of bfo .",
    "we mainly considered two types of distortion @xmath29 denoted as jt1 and jt2 . in jt1 ( see fig .",
    "[ jt1 ] ) , the atomic position of the fe atom is fixed at the center of the cell , whereas the six o atoms surrounding fe are distorted by @xmath30 @xmath310 , 0.01 , ... , 0.10@xmath32   along the @xmath33 direction in such a way that the elongation of some of them is compensated by the contraction of the other .",
    "we denote these systems as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... , @xmath36 . a double unit cell ( @xmath37 )",
    "was used to take into account afm coupling between the fe atoms as well .",
    "notice bfo has bao and feo@xmath38 layers .",
    "the two fe atoms in fig .",
    "[ jt1 ] are bonded through the o atoms of a bao layer .",
    "we denote these oxygen atoms as o@xmath39 . in the ideal case ( no distortion ) , the in - plane bond angle o - fe - o is 90 , the out of plane bond angle fe - o@xmath39-fe is 180 and the bond lengths is @xmath40 @xmath41  .",
    "the distortion of the octahedron around the fe atoms directly affects the bond lengths and bond angles between fe and the oxygens .",
    "since different o atoms are moving in opposite direction , it is expected that consecutive fe atoms will have different bond lengths and therefore there will be two different kinds of fe atoms , i.e. , fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 ( see fig  [ jt1 ] ) . in the second type of distortion jt2 ( fig .",
    "[ jt1 ] ) , the atomic positions of the o atoms are fixed and the fe atoms are displaced along the @xmath33 direction by @xmath29 from its ideal positions , i.e. , ( @xmath44 ) . notice that in both types of distortions the bond lengths and bond angles are perturbed but the atomic volume is conserved .",
    "the total energy was calculated for each distortion in the fm and afm states .",
    "the energy difference between the fm and afm states ( @xmath45 ) gives an approximate value of the exchange integral @xmath46 . in the following",
    "we will show how @xmath46 changes with @xmath29 and the exchange correlation functional ( without and with @xmath20 ) .",
    "the lda / gga and lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 calculated @xmath47 of jt1 is shown in the left panel of fig  [ jt1-te ] .",
    "negative ( positive ) @xmath47 corresponds to fm ( afm ) configurations . in both lda and",
    "gga the unstrained bfo is in the fm state but as the strain increases , @xmath47 decreases and changes sign around @xmath48 ev / @xmath49 .",
    "such reversal of sign is an indication of magnetic phase transition , fm @xmath50 afm .",
    "bfo remains in the afm state in the strained region ( 0.03 to 0.07 ) ev / @xmath49 . beyond 0.07 ev",
    "/ @xmath49 , bfo has however zero @xmath47 , i.e. , fm and afm are isoenergetic .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that bfo has to cross an energy barrier @xmath51 ev per cell to transit from one magnetic state ( fm ) to another magnetic state ( afm ) .",
    "when the calculations were repeated with lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 , a similar magnetic phase transition was obtained .",
    "including @xmath20 , however , decreases the barrier height ( @xmath52 ev ) , shifts the phase transition region to higher strains and reduces the isoenergetic region .",
    "the second type of strained bfo exhibits a different behavior ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ jt1-te ] ) .",
    "the lda / gga calculations show that bfo retains its fm configuration up to 0.07 ev / @xmath49 but beyond that point it transits to an afm state .",
    "this shows that large strains would be required for such magnetic phase transition .",
    "the phase transition is shifted to even higher strained regions @xmath53 ev / @xmath49 when @xmath20 is included .",
    "interestingly , @xmath47 has a local minimum around @xmath54 ev / @xmath49 , which is exactly the amount of strain where a fm - afm transition was observed in the jt1 case .",
    "comparing jt1 and jt2 , we see that when some of the oxygen atoms are moved away from the fe atoms distorting the octahedra the fe atoms couple antiferromagnetically beyond some strain limit . from this",
    "it is possible to infer that o displacements suppress de and favor se beyond some critical strain .",
    "changes in the exchange integral @xmath46 due to strain will therefore have significant effect on de and se interactions , as will be discussed below .",
    "moving the fe atoms away from the oxygen atoms brings however the fm order to lower energy states .",
    "these calculations suggest that small atomic displacements are crucial for the magnetic ground state structure .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moments per unit cell of bfo in the fm and afm states of jt1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ jt1-mm ] .",
    "the magnetic moments saturate at small displacements and are rather robust against small strains . in the small strain region",
    "the total magnetic moment per cell in the lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 is @xmath55 @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 @xmath56 per fe atom , suggesting that the nominal oxidation state of fe in this region is fe@xmath5 , which is consistent with the charge neutrality of bfo and agrees with experimental results .",
    "@xcite however , there is a drastic change in the magnetic moments around 0.04 ev / @xmath49 , since they tend to sharply decrease beyond this value .",
    "this is the region where the magnetic phase transition is also observed . beyond 0.08 ev / @xmath49 , the total magnetic moments in the fm state saturates at @xmath57 @xmath56 per cell . in this region ,",
    "lda / gga and lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 almost give the same magnetic moments per unit cell . to understand this drastic ( about 50 @xmath58 ) decrease in the value of the magnetic moment , we analyzed the mulliken charges of the fe atoms .",
    "the main drop in the magnetic moment comes from fe@xmath42 .",
    "this drop is due to the o@xmath39 atoms , which are displaced towards fe@xmath42 .",
    "such displacement decreases the bond length and angle between o@xmath39 and fe@xmath42 and strongly increases the overlap , which reduces the magnetic moment of fe@xmath42 .    the total magnetic moments per unit cell of jt1 in the afm state ( shown in fig .  [ jt1-mm ] ) are also analyzed . in the unstrained case",
    ", bfo has zero magnetic moment which is consistent with a true afm structure . however , when the structure is distorted , i.e. , when the octahedral symmetry is lowered , bfo develops a non zero magnetic moment .",
    "therefore , changing the atomic positions of the o atoms not only changes the local magnetic moments of the fe atoms , but it also transforms bfo to an afm structure with non zero magnetic moments , i.e. , a fim .",
    "it is interesting to note that starting from an afm structure , the electronic self - consistent cycle converges to a fim structure whenever some strain is imposed in the jt1 case .",
    "more importantly , it is also possible to see a more severe change in the total magnetic moments than that found in the fm calculations , i.e. , beyond 0.07 ev / @xmath49 , the total magnetic moment converges to @xmath59 @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , in both fm and afm calcul ations , the magnetic moments of the unit cell converge to @xmath60 @xmath56 , which suggests that fm and afm states are isomagnetic in this high - strain region .",
    "note that similar considerations were also derived from the total energy calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ jt1-te ] )    the magnetic moments of bfo in the fm and afm states were also examined in the jt2 case .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments in the fm states are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ jt1-mm ] .",
    "lda@xmath1/gga@xmath1 gives as before a magnetic moment per unit cell @xmath55 @xmath56 in the low strained region . upon imposing strain ,",
    "a drastic change in the magnetic moments is observed around @xmath61 ev / @xmath49 . beyond this strain",
    "the total magnetic moments converge to @xmath57 @xmath56 in the fm state , similar to the jt1 case .",
    "this drastic change in the magnetic moment is due to fe - o@xmath39 strong bonding , as discussed in the jt1 case . in the jt2 case , both fe atoms are moved towards the o@xmath39 atoms , which are fixed . at some strain both types of atoms bond strongly , which decreases the magnetic moments of fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 . in the strained afm case , which is more stable than the fm case , fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 have @xmath62 and 1.82 @xmath56 magnetic moments , respectively , for @xmath63 , where the fe@xmath42-o@xmath39 ( fe@xmath43-o@xmath39 ) bond length is @xmath64 / ( 2.94 ) .",
    "the net magnetic moment per unit cell in this case is zero , i.e. , a true afm structure .",
    "this implies that moving the fe atoms transforms bfo from fm to afm at large strains .",
    "this magnetic phase transition is different from that of the jt1 case , which transformed fm to fim at large strains .    to elucidate the origin of these magnetic phase transitions and the reduction of the magnetic moments beyond some critical strain , we focus on the effect of distortions on the electronic structure of bfo .",
    "as we previously showed , pristine bfo has a half metallic electronic structure where @xmath27 and @xmath65 states are separated from each other due to a crystal field splitting ( see fig.[dosfm ] ) .",
    "the calculated dos for the jt1 case in the fm and afm states for a strain of 0.03 ev / @xmath49 , which is very close to the fm - afm / fim transition , are given in fig .",
    "[ dos - sys3 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the electronic structure remains half metallic but now the low lying @xmath27 band is splitted into two energy states , particularly in the fe@xmath42 @xmath11 band .",
    "a broad majority @xmath27 band is also formed just below the fermi energy , which shows a strong bonding with the o@xmath39 atom connecting fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 .",
    "both fe atoms have different local magnetic moments and exchange splittings , which implies that strain changes the local symmetry and distorts differently the electronic structure of each atom .",
    "similar behavior can be seen in the afm dos as well .",
    "we consider now the electronic structure in the strained region , where afm / fim is the ground state structure , to have a clear understanding of such magnetic phase transition .",
    "figure [ dos - sys5 ] shows the electronic structure of jt1 bfo under 0.05 ev / @xmath49 ( @xmath66 ) in the fm and afm states .",
    "the most noticeable feature of this electronic structure is a clear splitting of the low lying fe @xmath27 band , in both the fm and afm states . at this strain ,",
    "the jt distortion is almost completed at the fe@xmath42 site , while fe@xmath43 will show a similar jt distortion at higher strains .",
    "the fm - afm / fim magnetic phase transition is mainly caused by such jt distortion at the fe@xmath42 site , which destabilizes the fm ground state and reduces the local magnetic moment , as compared with the pristine and low strained systems .",
    "the oxygen pdos associated to o@xmath39 is also significantly changed , and becomes partially occupied .",
    "therefore , the fm state becomes unstable when the pdos of o@xmath39 in the spin - up state touches the fermi energy . at larger strains the o@xmath39 pdos further crosses the fermi energy , which stabilizes the afm / fim state",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ dos_sys9 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ dos_sys9 ] shows the pdos in the fm and afm states of jt1 @xmath63 .",
    "compared with the unstrained bfo in the fm state , the @xmath27 states of fe are shifted now towards the fermi energy .",
    "there are also unoccupied @xmath11 states which were occupied in the unstrained case .",
    "the exchange splitting of the fe@xmath42 @xmath11 band significantly decreases , which reduces its magnetic moment to 0.12 @xmath56 in the fm state .",
    "however , fe@xmath43 still carries a large magnetic moment .",
    "the local moments of both fe atoms are therefore different ( see also their pdos ) , which implies the presence of different crystallographic environments .",
    "@xcite in such different local environments the fe atoms generate a fim - type behavior , similar to fim fe@xmath38o@xmath0 .",
    "the band structure in the afm case is similar and shows that fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 are not coupling antiferromagnetically but ferrimagnetically , which is consistent with the local magnetic moments of fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath67 .",
    "the dos also demonstrates the existence of an electronic phase transition ( half metal to metallic ) at large strains .",
    "the magnetic phase transition is therefore accompanied by an electronic phase transition at large strains , mainly contributed by @xmath27 and o @xmath68 orbitals .    to shed more light on the mechanism of the phase transition we look now into the spin densities of different systems in the fm and afm states in the ( 110 ) plane .",
    "this analysis will further help us to understand the origin of magnetic phase transitions and the reduction of magnetic moments at large strains .",
    "figure  [ spin - dos ] shows the spin densities of jt1 @xmath69 , @xmath70 and jt2 @xmath70 .",
    "the spin denisty of @xmath69 exhibits a large spin polarization at o@xmath39 , both in the fm and afm states and a large spin density at the fe sites .",
    "also , a clear anitiferromagnetic coupling between fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 can be seen in the afm state .",
    "notice that as we increase the strain the magnetic moment at the fe@xmath42 site starts decreasing because the o@xmath39 atom connecting fe@xmath42 and fe@xmath43 moves towards fe@xmath42 , which decreases its magnetic moment .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figure  [ spin - dos ] , where fe @xmath43 has a large spin polarization , whereas fe@xmath42 has a smaller magnetic moment of @xmath71 @xmath56 ( @xmath72 @xmath56 ) in the fm ( afm ) state .",
    "notice also the spin polarization at the o@xmath39 site is reduced .",
    "this behavior shows again that the fm - afm / fim transition is mainly governed by strong fe@xmath42-o@xmath39 bondings . in the jt2",
    "@xmath70 the spin densities of both fe atoms decrease again due to the strong overlap with the o@xmath39 atom but their shape is indistinguishable , which is expected since the local environments are the same .",
    "the origin of the fm - afm / fim phase transition can be discussed in terms of se and de models .",
    "generally , compressing a lattice parameter @xmath15 leads to the increase of the hopping integral @xmath73 , represented by @xmath74 . in this particular case",
    "@xmath73 personifies the orbital hybridization between o @xmath28 and fe@xmath75 .",
    "since de and se energies are proportional to @xmath73 and @xmath76 , respectively , increasing @xmath73 enhances se as compared with de . in our case the lattice constant @xmath15 of bfo is fixed at its optimized value , and we only changed the bond angle / length between the atoms in such a way that it strongly modifies the electronic structure . as we have shown ( see all dos figures )",
    "when the strain increases , the hybridization between the fe and o orbitals also increases . at a large strains @xmath73 becomes very strong and bfo transitions to afm / fim .",
    "this shows that se is enhanced by strain , since the oxygen band width increases and favors afm / fim . on the other hand , at low strain the overlap between fe",
    "@xmath77 and o @xmath6 is relatively weak and de wins , which compels bfo to be in the fm state .",
    "this competition between de and se is consistent with our total energy calculations , i.e. , fm vs. afm states . at large strain",
    "the energy difference @xmath46 increases , suggesting that @xmath73 also increases , which agrees with the dos figures .",
    "in such competition , the magnetic moments decrease due to the strong @xmath73 .",
    "changing @xmath15 can also change the magnetic structure of bfo , i.e. , a - type or g - type helical spin structures .",
    "in particular , decreasing @xmath15 produces a g - type structure .",
    "@xcite such magnetic structural changes are again mainly caused by @xmath73 . in the light of the phase diagrams presented in ref.(fig.3 ) , where it is shown that the transition from fm to a helical magnetic ( hm ) phase transition depends on @xmath78 and oxygen - oxygen hoping amplitudes @xmath79 , it is possible to infer that large @xmath79 is also important for the stabilization of the hm state . in our case , straining bfo produces afm or fim magnetic states , depending on the nature of the strain .",
    "therefore , we believe that the experimentally observed magnetic phase transition at high pressure or external magnetic fields@xcite may distort the local environment of the fe and o atoms in bfo and such distortion can favor fm - fim / afm magnetic phase transitions .",
    "cubic bafeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) was investigated using density functional theory ( dft ) within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the effect of on site coulomb interaction @xmath20 was also considered .",
    "we showed that bfo has a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state in all cases .",
    "this fm ground state is in agreement with recent experimental work .",
    "the electronic and magnetic structure of bfo was modified by two different types of jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions , denoted as jt1 and jt2 .",
    "we showed that jt frustrates the magnetic structure of bfo and induces fm to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and fm to ferrimagnetic ( fim ) transitions .",
    "such magnetic phase transitions are governed by the displacements of the o and fe atoms from their ideal positions .",
    "the dft and dft@xmath1 calculations reveled that a larger jt distortion is needed for the fm to afm transition as compared to the fm to fim transition .",
    "the coulomb interaction mainly shifted the magnetic phase transition to higher strains .",
    "the jt distortions also reduced the magnetic moments of the fe atoms .",
    "the mechanisms of the transitions were elucidated using partial densities of states and spin density contours .",
    "these results suggest that different magnetic phase transitions can be induced in bfo by different types of strain .",

    "<S> using density functional theory ( dft ) with local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) correlation functionals , the electronic and magnetic structures of cubic bafeo@xmath0 in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states are studied . </S>",

    "<S> two types of jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions , denoted as jt1 and jt2 , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find fm to ferrimagnetic ( fim ) and fm to afm magnetic phase transitionn in the jt1 and jt2 type of distortions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> larger strains are required for the fm - afm transition as compared to the fm - fim . </S>",
    "<S> dft@xmath1 calculations also show that the magnetic moments dramatically decrease at large strains due to strong overlapping between the fe and o atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the origins of these transitions is discussed in terms of a competition between double exchange and superexchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen and fe displacements are therefore responsible for the magnetic phase transitions and the reduction of the magnetic moments . </S>"
