    "since its introduction by witten @xcite , the idea of twisting supersymmetric field theories has had a profound impact on quantum field theory and on related areas of mathematics .",
    "twisted supersymmetric field theories know about certain bps operators in the original physical theory , and often one can perform exact computations in the twisted theory . in this way one can obtain many checks on the conjectural dualities of string and @xmath1-theory .",
    "one important duality is not accessible by this method , however : the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this is because the ads / cft correspondence relates a supersymmetric field theory with a supergravity theory , and witten s construction of twisting does not apply to supergravity .    in this paper",
    "we remedy this gap , by proposing a definition of twisted supergravity which we conjecture is ads dual to twisted supersymmetric field theory .",
    "we give conjectural formulations of twisted type iia and type iib supergravity in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "for example , we conjecture that twisted type iib supergravity is the kodaira - spencer theory @xcite ( or bcov theory as extended for arbitrary calabi - yau manifolds in @xcite ) in @xmath2 complex dimensions .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , type iib twisted supergravity theory can be quantized uniquely in perturbation theory , despite the fact that the theory is non - renormalizable .",
    "this result was proved in @xcite where we showed that bcov theory on @xmath3 admits a canonically defined perturbative quantization .",
    "we believe a similar argument applies to type iia ; we plan to present the details elsewhere .",
    "these results are the first step in a program to give a precise formulation of the ads / cft correspondence in terms of rigorously defined mathematical objects : quantum twisted supergravity and quantum twisted supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "we will explore the ads / cft correspondence in detail in subsequent publications .",
    "the primary aim of this article is to define and motivate the concept of twisted supergravity , to state our conjectural description for various twisted supergravity theories , and to provide evidence for these conjectures .    to be able to formulate the twisted ads / cft correspondence , we need to understand not just twisted supergravity , but also how branes appear in twisted supergravity . in this paper",
    "we describe how @xmath4-branes behave in our twists of type iia and type iib .",
    "we find that the theory living on a @xmath4-brane in twisted type iib supergravity can be described as holomorphic chern - simons theory on a certain supermanifold , and that there is a similar description for @xmath4-branes in type iia .",
    "we prove ( using a result of baulieu ) that the theory living on a @xmath4-brane in twisted supergravity in @xmath0 dimensions is a twist of the theory living on the brane in the physical theory .",
    "we hope that our formulation of twisted string theory and supergravity will make aspects of the subject accessible to mathematicians .",
    "indeed , we conjecture that twists of type iia and iib superstring theory can be described in terms of topological string theories which are mixtures of @xmath5- and @xmath6-models .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the concept of twisted supergravity and discuss its relation with twisted supersymmetric field theories .      before describing twisted supergravity ,",
    "let us first recall what a twisted supersymmetric field theory is .",
    "suppose we have a supersymmetric field theory in dimension @xmath7 , which is acted on by the lorentz group @xmath8 and has an @xmath9-symmetry group @xmath10 .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath10 act on the supersymmetries of the theory . as witten described it , twisting the theory amounts to performing the following three steps .    1 .",
    "first , we choose a homomorphism @xmath11 .",
    "this gives rise to a new action of @xmath8 on the fields of the theory , using the homomorphism @xmath12 and the action of @xmath13 on the fields .",
    "using these new action of @xmath8 means that we have changed the spin of the fields , and also of the supersymmetries .",
    "2 .   next , we choose a supercharge @xmath14 which is invariant under the new action of @xmath8 , and which has @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   finally",
    ", we add @xmath14 to the brst differential @xmath16 of the theory , and treat the differential @xmath17 as the brst differential of the twisted theory .",
    "for example , the space of physical operators in the twisted theory is the cohomology of the space of operators of the original theory with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "typically , this cohomology is much smaller than the cohomology with respect to just @xmath16 .",
    "the criterion that @xmath14 must be invariant under a copy of @xmath8 implies that the image of the operation of bracketing with @xmath14 in the supersymmetry algebra is an @xmath8-invariant subspace of @xmath18 , and so must be the whole space ( otherwise @xmath14 would be central ) .",
    "this tells us that translation in every direction in space - time is @xmath14-exact .",
    "this implies that the hamiltonian and momentum operators in the twisted theory are zero , and that the correlation functions of local operators are independent of position .",
    "these are hallmarks of having a topological theory .",
    "if one is willing to consider non lorentz - invariant theories , there is no need for step 1 .",
    "we can just choose any supercharge @xmath14 of square zero , and then add @xmath14 to the brst differential .",
    "these leads to a more general class of twists than those originally considered by witten .",
    "these twists may not be topological .",
    "for example , working in euclidean signature on @xmath19 , there is typically whenever there are at least @xmath20 supercharges ] a unique @xmath14 ( up to rotation by @xmath9-symmetry ) which is @xmath21-invariant , and for which the translations @xmath22 in anti - holomorphic directions are @xmath14-exact .",
    "this is a holomorphic twist .",
    "the holomorphic twist is present even when there is no topological twist , and will contain more information about the physical theory than any topological twist will .",
    "we mention this because the twists of supergravity that we will be interested in will be of this more general kind .      in supergravity ,",
    "the local supersymmetry algebra is a gauge symmetry of the theory .    in ordinary einstein gravity ,",
    "the fundamental field is a metric , and the diffeomorphisms play the role of gauge symmetries .",
    "the functional integral ( morally speaking ) is an integral over a space of metrics modulo gauge . in the bv formalism , which is how we like to approach field theory ,",
    "one models the quotient of the space of metrics by diffeomorphisms by introducing ghost fields corresponding to vector fields on the manifold .",
    "these ghost fields are fermionic ( i.e. anti - commuting ) ; they have cohomological degree @xmath23 .    in supergravity",
    ", there are more fields and more symmetries .",
    "the precise field content will not matter right now ; however , it is important to understand the extra symmetries . as well as",
    "diffeomorphism symmetries , there are extra _ fermionic _ symmetries called local supersymmetries .",
    "these are sections of a bundle of spinors ( which bundle of spinors appears depends on the theory considered ) . like in ordinary gravity and in gauge theory",
    ", one should introduce ghost fields to model taking the quotient of the space of fields by these symmetries .",
    "the ghost field corresponding to an ordinary bosonic symmetry is fermionic .",
    "similarly , the ghost corresponding to a fermionic symmetry is _",
    "bosonic_. for a supergravity theory on @xmath24 , where the local supersymmetries take value in some spin representation @xmath25 of @xmath26 , then the bosonic ghost fields are elements @xmath27 that is , @xmath28 is an @xmath25-valued smooth functions on @xmath29 .",
    "the main idea is that :    to understand this better , however , we need to understand the equations of motion satisfied by this bosonic ghost field .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , we consider a supergravity configuration on @xmath29 where the only fields that take a non - zero value are the metric @xmath30 and the bosonic ghost field @xmath28 .",
    "then , this configuration satisfies the equations of motion if and only if    1 .",
    "@xmath30 satisfies the usual equations of motion of supergravity , that is , it is ricci flat .",
    "the spinor @xmath28 is covariant constant for the metric given by @xmath30 .",
    "the spinor @xmath28 satisfies @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the map defining the lie bracket on the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "( thus , the components of @xmath33 are @xmath33-matrices ) .    the fact that @xmath30 must be ricci flat is immediate .",
    "to see the second equation , note that the supergravity action functional , in the bv formalism , will have a term like @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the anti - field to the gravitino , and @xmath36 refers to the covariant derivative of the ghost field @xmath28 with respect to the metric @xmath30 .",
    "this term reflects the gauge symmetry of the gravitino of the form @xmath37 .",
    "variation of this term with respect to @xmath35 will tell us that @xmath38 .",
    "there will also be a term of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the anti - field to the ghost for the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry , and @xmath41 is viewed as a vector field on @xmath29 and thus as a ghost for the diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "varying this term with respect to @xmath40 leads to the equation that @xmath42 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    recall that when we discuss quantum field theory on @xmath24 , to define the functional integral , we need to not only specify the lagrangian , but we also need to specify the behaviour of the fields at infinity . typically one requires that the fields converge towards some fixed constant solution to the equations of motion at infinity .",
    "this is the choice of a vacuum of the theory .",
    "we can do the same thing in supergravity .",
    "we can consider the theory on flat space where at @xmath43 we require the fields to converge towards some fixed vacuum solution .",
    "twisted supergravity on @xmath29 is supergravity in the vacuum where the metric is the standard flat metric , and the bosonic ghost field take some non - zero value @xmath28 with @xmath42 .",
    "note that this vacuum will not be lorentz invariant , only translation invariant .",
    "if one considers supergravity in perturbation theory , the fields will be small fluctuations of this vacuum .    of course",
    ", one can consider twisted supergravity on other manifolds than @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a manifold of dimension @xmath44 , then a twisted background for supergravity on @xmath1 is a solution to the equations of motion where the bosonic ghost takes some non - zero value .",
    "such a solution to the equations of motion will consist of a metric on @xmath1 , together with some other bosonic fields ( such as flux fields ) , which satisfy the usual equations of motion .",
    "these fields must admit a generalized killing spinor ( i.e.  be a bps solution ) , and the value of the bosonic ghost is some generalized killing spinor of square zero .",
    "if we work in perturbation theory , then it makes sense to consider twisted supergravity on a compact manifold .",
    "this is just supergravity in perturbation theory around a twisted background .",
    "non - perturbatively , however , this does nt really make sense , as one must perform the path integral over all field configurations .",
    "one can , however , imagine finding an approximation to the full non - perturbative supergravity path integral by doing perturbation theory around each solution to the equations of motion and then performing a finite - dimensional integral over the space of solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "if one does this , one sees that twisted supergravity backgrounds will contribute to the full supergravity path integral .      in this section",
    "we will explain an analogy that supergravity in a twisted vacuum is similar to a gauge theory on the coulomb branch .",
    "suppose we have a gauge theory on @xmath24 with gauge group @xmath45 , with some matter fields .",
    "the precise field content is not important for this discussion , but let us assume that the matter fields include a scalar field @xmath46 living in a representation @xmath9 of the group @xmath45 .",
    "suppose we are in a vacuum of the theory where the scalar field @xmath46 has some non - zero expectation value .",
    "then , the theory is said to be on the higgs branch .",
    "we should think of the field @xmath46 as an excitation of a constant field @xmath47 valued in the representation @xmath9 of @xmath45 .",
    "in this situation , the gauge symmetry of the theory is broken to the subgroup @xmath48 of elements which fix the element @xmath49 . often , this subgroup is trivial .    at the origin of the higgs branch ,",
    "the element @xmath49 takes value @xmath50 . in this case , the gauge symmetry of the theory is not broken at all , and another branch of the moduli of vacua breaks off : the coulomb branch . on the coulomb branch , expectation values of operators constructed from the gauge field have some non - zero value .",
    "something similar happens in supergravity .",
    "suppose we have a supergravity theory in @xmath7 dimensions , coupled to some supersymmetric field theory .",
    "let us suppose that this supersymmetric theory has some ( possibly disconnected ) space of vacua , which contains a smaller space of supersymmetric vacua .",
    "let s fist consider `` ordinary '' vacua of this coupled theory , where the bosonic ghost fields have zero expectation value .",
    "a generic such vacuum will have no supersymmetry , just like a generic vacuum on the higgs branch of a suitable gauge theory will have no gauge symmetry .",
    "at supersymmetric vacua an extra branch of the moduli space of vacua breaks off , on which the bosonic ghosts have non - zero expectation value .",
    "this is completely analogous to the way the moduli of vacua of a gauge theory can acquire a coulomb branch connecting to the higgs branch at vacua with non - trivial gauge symmetry .",
    "any supersymmetric field theory in dimension @xmath44 with @xmath51-extended supersymmetry can be coupled to the corresponding @xmath51-extended supergravity theory . in particular ,",
    "if we treat the supergravity theory as a classical theory , we can consider the supersymmetric field theory in any supergravity background .",
    "we are interested in what happens to a supersymmetric field theory placed in a twisted supergravity background , i.e. a background where the bosonic ghost field has non - zero value .    to be concrete ,",
    "let s consider our supersymmetric theory on a manifold @xmath1 in a supergravity background where the only non - zero fields are the metric and the bosonic ghost field @xmath28 .",
    "we require that the bosonic ghost @xmath28 takes value @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a covariant - constant spinor - field @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the corresponding supersymmetry acting on the super - symmetric field theory .",
    "the supersymmetric field theory in this supergravity background is the same as the supersymmetric theory twisted by the supercharge @xmath55 .",
    "( recall that by twisting we mean that we add @xmath55 to the brst operator @xmath56 ) .",
    "let us consider the brst operator of the theory coupling the supersymmetric field theory to the supergravity theory ( where we consider both theories , for now , at the classical level ) .",
    "in this coupled theory , we have gauged the action of local supersymmetry on both the supergravity theory and the supersymmetric field theory .",
    "it follows that one of the terms in this brst operator must be the chevalley - eilenberg differential for the action of local supersymmetry on fields .",
    "let us write down this term in the brst operator explicitly . to fix notation ,",
    "let us pick a basis of the ( infinite - dimensional ) space of local supersymmetries , say @xmath57 , and let @xmath58 be the corresponding dual basis of the dual vector space .",
    "we will view the functions @xmath58 as parametrizing the bosonic ghost - field .",
    "then , the term in the brst operator which comes from this chevalley - eilenberg differential , applied to a local operator @xmath59 of the supersymmetric field theory , is of the form @xmath60 here by @xmath61 we mean the action of supersymmetry corresponding to @xmath57 on the operators of the gauge theory .",
    "if the bosonic ghost field @xmath28 is given a particular value @xmath62 , we find that we have added @xmath63 to the brst differential of the field theory .",
    "although we will not focus so much in this paper on the other aspect of twisting supersymmetric field theories , whereby one changes the spin if the fields using a homomorphism from @xmath64 to the @xmath9-symmetry group , this can also be given a supergravity interpretation @xcite .",
    "for this to work , we need to use a model of supergravity in which the @xmath9 symmetry group is gauged . then , given a homomorphism @xmath65",
    ", one can construct a principal @xmath10 bundle with connection on any riemannian @xmath7-manifold as the bundle associated to the frame bundle with its levi - civita connection , using the homomorphism @xmath66 .",
    "since the @xmath9 symmetry group is gauged , a riemannian manifold equipped with this @xmath10 bundle defines a supergravity background . putting a supersymmetric field theory in a background of this form has the effect of changing the spin of the fields .",
    "the rest of the paper contains conjectural descriptions of certain twists of type iia and type iib supergravity theories , together with evidence for these conjectures .",
    "we start by reviewing some features of bcov theory , which we will need to formulate our conjectural descriptions of twisted supergravity theories .",
    "then , we discuss twisted type iib supergravity .",
    "we conjecture that twisted type iib supergravity on @xmath67 is bcov theory on @xmath3 .",
    "we further conjecture that the twist of the type iib superstring is the @xmath6-model topological string theory on @xmath3 .    for formal reasons ,",
    "one expects to find the @xmath14-cohomology of the @xmath68 supersymmetry algebra of type @xmath69 supergravity appearing in the fields of the twisted supergravity theory . here",
    "@xmath14 is the supercharge which we use to twist .",
    "we calculate this @xmath14 cohomology algebra and find that it does indeed appear in the fields of bcov theory on @xmath3 .",
    "there are some subtle points here : the supersymmetry algebra of type iib that we analyze is not simply the @xmath68 supersymmetry algebra in @xmath0 dimensions , but rather its central extension corresponding to the fundamental string . we find that , for the commutator in the residual algebra of supersymmetries to hold in bcov theory , it is necessary to take account of this central extension .",
    "then , we analyze the relation between @xmath4-branes in type iib superstring theory and branes in the topological @xmath6-model on @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the holomorphic twist of the theory living on a @xmath70 brane ( i.e.  of the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in @xmath71 dimensions ) is the theory living on a topological @xmath6-brane on @xmath72 , which is a version of holomorphic chern - simons .",
    "baulieu @xcite proved this in the case that @xmath73 , and we derive the general case as a consquence of his result .",
    "as a further consistency check , we calculate that the residual supersymmetry that acts on the holomorphic twist of the theory on a @xmath70 brane matches with part of the @xmath14-cohomology of the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath68 supersymmetry algebra that appears in bcov theory .",
    "the results of @xcite to show that bcov theory ( and so , conjecturally , twisted type iib supergravity ) can be perturbatively quantized on @xmath3 . to have a self - contained story",
    ", we will explain a little about these results from the point of view expounded here .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite concerns bcov theory on @xmath3 coupled to holomorphic chern - simons theory for the group @xmath74 .",
    "the statement is that the coupled open - closed theory can be quantized in a unique way when we work in a uniform way in @xmath75 .",
    "the proof has two parts : first , we verify that a certain one - loop anomaly vanishes . this is somewhat analogous to the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation",
    "then , we construct the theory at all loops using a cohomological argument , whereby possible counter - terms from the open - string sector cancel precisely with those from the closed string sector .",
    "holomorphic chern - simons on @xmath3 is a twist of @xmath0-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theor .",
    "this supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group @xmath76 is the theory living on a stack of @xmath75 @xmath77 branes in type iib .",
    "it has recently been argued @xcite , that one can realize the theory with gauge group the super - group @xmath78 from a stack of @xmath75 @xmath77 and @xmath75 anti-@xmath77 branes .",
    "thus , the main result of @xcite can be interpreted as saying that , after twisting , the theory coupling type iib supergravity with @xmath75 @xmath77 and @xmath75 anti-@xmath77 branes has a unique quantization in perturbation theory .",
    "it is natural to ask whether a similar statement holds before twisting , and in particular whether the one - loop anomaly cancellation result of @xcite can be seen in the physical theory .",
    "this would be an interesting type iib analog of green - schwarz s classic result .",
    "we perform a similar analysis for type iia .",
    "we consider an @xmath79 invariant twist of type iia supergravity and superstring theory .",
    "we conjecture that the twist of the string theory is a topological string theory on @xmath80 which is the topological @xmath5-model on @xmath81 and the topological @xmath6-model on @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , we conjecture that the twist of type iia supergravity theory is the closed string field theory constructed from this topological string ( which we write down explicitly ) .",
    "we analyze the @xmath14-cohomology of the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath83 supersymmetry algebra of type iia .",
    "we find this supersymmetry algebra present in our conjectural description of twisted type iia supergravity . as in the case of type iib ,",
    "for this to work we need to use the central extension of the @xmath83 supersymmetry algebra in @xmath0 dimensions corresponding to the fundamental string .",
    "we then analyze the @xmath4-branes in type iia in a manner parallel to our analysis of branes in type iib .",
    "a brane in the topological string theory which we conjecture is the twist of type iia lives on a submanifold of @xmath80 of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are linear subspaces .",
    "we prove that the theory living on this brane is a twist of the theory living on the @xmath87 brane in the physical string theory .",
    "we also show that the residual supersymmetries present in our twisted type iia supergravity which preserve the brane are precisely the residual supersymmetries present in the twist of the @xmath87-brane gauge theory .",
    "one expects twists of type iia and type iib superstring theory to be related by @xmath88-duality .",
    "we verify that our twist of type iia on @xmath89 is @xmath88-dual to our twist of type iib on @xmath90 .",
    "we also verify that type iia and type iib supergravity theories become the same when reduced to @xmath91 dimensions .",
    "our conjectural descriptions of twisted supergravity theories are mostly in terms of bcov theory ( also known as kodaira - spenser theory ) , whose definition ( as formulated in @xcite generalizing that in @xcite ) we briefly recall .",
    "we refer to @xcite for detailed discussion .",
    "if @xmath92 is a calabi - yau of dimension @xmath7 , let @xmath93 be the space of poly - vector fields of type @xmath94 on @xmath92 .",
    "contraction with the holomorphic volume form yields an isomorphism @xmath95 and so to operators @xmath96 on @xmath97 which correspond via this isomorphism to the operators of the same name on @xmath98 .",

    ", a field theory is specified by a dg manifold with an odd symplectic structure .",
    "locally , one reconstructs the action functional from this data by representing the differential as the hamiltonian vector field associated to a function ; this function is the action functional .",
    "a degenerate theory is specified by a dg manifold with an odd poisson structure . since",
    "not every poisson vector field is hamiltonian , a degenerate theory does not necessarily have an action functional .",
    "we will find that our theory can be specified by a dg odd poisson manifold where the linear term in the differential is not hamiltonian , but the non - linear terms are .",
    "we can alternatively describe the theory as being given by a linear odd dg poisson manifold , with constant - coefficient poisson tensor , together with a functional describing the interactions .",
    "this functional satisfies the classical master equation . adding the poisson bracket with this functional to the differential",
    "deforms the linear poisson manifold to a non - linear one .    for us ,",

    "we are abusing notation in our use of the symbol @xmath123 above : really we mean an appropriate completion which describes polyvector fields on @xmath122 with distributional coefficients .",

    "note that the poisson tensor lives in the subspace of fields which have no powers of @xmath115 .",
    "for a theory which is degenerate in the bv formalism , and with a constant - coefficient odd poisson tensor , the propagator @xmath127 with an infrared cutoff is constructed so that it provides a homotopy between the odd poisson tensor and a different odd poisson tensor which is smooth .",

    ", we will explain how to realize the @xmath353 of twists of @xmath182 supersymmetric yang - mills in terms of supergravity .    as we have seen , the holomorphic twist of the @xmath250 brane theory is holomorphic chern - simons theory on @xmath443 . if , as before , @xmath375 are bosonic coordinates and @xmath444",

    "the @xmath353 of twists introduced by kapustin and witten is implemented by the family of supercharges @xmath445 for complex numbers @xmath446 .",

    "this follows immediately from our discussion above .",
    "now we can quote one of the main results of @xcite .",
    "bcov theory on @xmath3 admits a unique quantization which extends to a quantization of the theory coupling bcov theory with holomorphic chern - simons on @xmath3 , with gauge group @xmath151 , compatible with the embedding @xmath455 .",
    "this theorem tells us that our candidate for twisted type iib supergravity can be quantized in perturbation theory , in a canonical way .    combining the result of baulieu with that of @xcite",

    "thus , we can interpret this theorem as saying that there is a unique quantization of twisted type iib supergravity which is compatible with coupling to such a brane - antibrane system .",
    "in the physical string theory , @xmath4-branes are eletrically and magnetically charged under the ramond - ramond fields . in this section",
    "we will see how branes in the @xmath6-model on @xmath3 are magnetically charged under certain fields of bcov theory .",
    "this will allow us to match certain fields of bcov theory with components of the rr field - strengths of type iib .",
    "we will argue that we ca nt see how branes are electrically charged in the twisted theory because bcov theory only knows about the field - strengths of the ramond - ramond fields .",

    "we can construct a de rham current @xmath458 where by @xmath459 we mean @xmath460 where @xmath461 is the laplacian .",

    "one arises at the expression for @xmath470 in the presence of a @xmath70-brane by observing that , in the presence of a @xmath70-brane , there are terms in the lagrangian of the form @xmath471 varying with respect to @xmath472 tells us that @xmath473 is a @xmath121-function on @xmath474 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we will find a similar pattern in bcov theory . consider a brane on @xmath72 .",
    "we would like to view the brane as deforming the action functional of bcov theory .",
    "the natural deformation of the action functional will arise by considering the @xmath6-model topological string on worldsheets which have one boundary on the brane .",
    "the first such worldsheet that one encounters is a disc with boundary on the brane , and with a single interior marked point labelled by a field of bcov theory .",
    "there is a subtlety that arises when one tries to make sense of this @xmath6-model amplitude . because we are considering the topological string",
    ", we should integrate over the moduli of the worldsheet . in this case",

    "we can do this by rigidifying the disc by putting a single marked point on the boundary , which we label by the identity operator on the brane .",
    "then , we find that the closed - open string map is the map @xmath476 where @xmath477 is the @xmath478 form obtained by contracting the polyvector field @xmath479 with @xmath480 .",
    "what happens when we take account of the circle rotation ? in a topological field theory , the @xmath475 action on the space of states associated to a circle extends to an action of the algebra @xmath481 of singular chains on @xmath475 .",

    "an action of this algebra is given by an operator of cohomological degree @xmath23 which squares to zero .",

    ", we conclude that if @xmath491 is the linear map @xmath492 obtained from the disc with one point in the interior and boundary on the brane @xmath179 , then @xmath493 in other words , @xmath494    how does this relate to what happens in the physical string ?",
    "the only possibility is that the field @xmath495 represents a component of the field - strength of the ramond - ramond @xmath71-form .",
    "thus , @xmath496 will be a component of the rr form , which is electrically coupled to the brane by integrating it over the brane .",
    "we further conclude that bcov theory , as we have presented it , does not contain a field corresponding to the rr form itself .",
    "let us now use our calculation of the leading term in the action of bcov theory in the presence of a @xmath497 brane to calculate the equations of motion in the presence of the brane .",
    "let us calculate to leading order , by ignoring the interaction term in bcov theory .",
    "let us also use the original formulation of bcov theory involving a non - local quadratic term .",
    "the relevant term in the action is then @xmath498 this leads to the equation that @xmath499 where distributional @xmath500 form @xmath501 is turned into a distributional @xmath502 poly - vector field .",
    "this tells us that the @xmath70 brane is magnetically charged under @xmath503 .",
    "we can introduce new fields into bcov theory whose field - strengths will be certain polyvector fields that appear in the original formulation . in this section",
    "we will sketch briefly how to do this .",
    "as we have seen , in the physical string , the rr @xmath264-form @xmath504 and the rr @xmath505-form @xmath506 are not independent , but satisfy @xmath507 thus , it is not possible to have a formulation where both the fields @xmath504 and @xmath506 are treated as fundamental fields .",
    "instead , one has to treat half of the rr forms as fundamental , for example , @xmath508 .",
    "then , only the field - strengths of @xmath509 will exist in the theory , and will be represented by @xmath510 .    in type iib",
    "there is a problem because the rr @xmath20-form is it s own electro - magnetic dual .",
    "thus , one of the constraints of the theory is that @xmath511 is self - dual .",
    "one can not , therefore , have formulation of type iib as a conventional field theory where @xmath512 is treated as a fundamental field .",
    "either one introduces the constraint ( not coming from the lagrangian ) that @xmath511 is self - dual , or one treats the self - dual @xmath2-form as a fundamental field and with the additional constraint that it is closed",
    ".    we will find that exactly this phenomenon occurs in bcov theory . the way we have presented it , we have treated the rr field - strengths as the fundamental fields and had the constraint that the fields are in the kernel of the operator @xmath99 .",
    "( in our formulation , we represented this by setting up the theory as a degenerate theory in the bv formalism , which presumably one can also do for physical type iib supergravity ) .",
    "however , we can introduce a different formulation of bcov theory where some , but not all , of the original polyvector fields will be represented as @xmath99 of something .",

    "the fields in @xmath529 are in degree @xmath530 .",
    "the differential is , as before , @xmath116 , with the convention that in the second summand the operation of multiplying by @xmath115 on a field accompanied by @xmath531 yields @xmath50 .",
    "fields with negative powers of @xmath115 are gauge transformations for the ramond - ramond fields .",
    "the fields in the second summand are the rr forms , together with their gauge transformations .",
    "there is a map from this new complex of fields to the original complex of fields of the form @xmath532 in the last row , we see how this map sends an element @xmath533 where @xmath534 ( thought of as a ramond - ramond form field ) to @xmath535 , which we interpret as one of the components of the field strength .",
    "the kernel which defines the bv anti - bracket for bcov theory lifts to an element in the tensor square of this new space of fields .",
    "if we restrict the interaction @xmath140 from the original space of fields to this new space of fields , we find automatically a solution to the classical master equation .",

    "the proof of this is rather indirect . we know , from general arguments , that there must be such an action on the twisted theory and that translations , @xmath9-symmetry , and space - time rotations must act in the obvious way .",
    "we then find that there s a unique way to make the fermionic elements act so that the commutation relations hold .",
    "let us start by computing the @xmath14-cohomology of the supersymmetry algebra in various dimensions , starting with @xmath400 .",

    "such a homomorphism is , in particular , an @xmath214- invariant element in @xmath856 invariant theory for @xmath214 tells us that the space of invariants is of rank two , with one invariant element in @xmath857 and the other in @xmath858 . in coordinates",
    ", the first invariant element corresponds to the supersymmetries acting by the polyvector fields @xmath859 , and the other corresponds to the supersymmetries acting by @xmath418 .",
    "the first possibility can be excluded because these are bosonic elements in the super lie algebra of polyvector fields .",
    "it follows that we have proved that the only possible action of the residual supersymmetries in the case @xmath400 is by the vector fields @xmath418 acting on @xmath402 .",
    "next , let us discuss the case @xmath412 .",
    "we find , by an argument similar to that used in the @xmath400 case , that we need a homomorphism of lie algebras from our residual supersymmetry algebra to the cyclic cohomology of @xmath860 , which is @xmath861 . at the level of cohomology , only polyvector fields that are of dolbeault degree @xmath50 and in the kernel of @xmath394 survive .",
    "we find that the cohomology of the space of polyvector fields is @xmath862 where @xmath863 is the space of holomorphic functions on @xmath179 and @xmath99 is the divergence operator .",

    "the @xmath866 can not involve any @xmath483 s , and as functions of @xmath868 they must be constant , so that they are in @xmath869 if @xmath870 , then the only elements which transform in the correct representation are of the form @xmath871 but these elements are odd polyvector fields , whereas to correspond to supersymmetries they must be even .",
