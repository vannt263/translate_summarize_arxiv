    "throughout our calculations , we will keep @xmath17 fixed .",

    "such a mean - field analysis provides a reasonable description of the zero temperature phase diagram , but at finite temperature , it neglects the contribution of non - condensed pairs to both the density @xmath25 and magnetisation @xmath26 .",
    "this contribution is necessary to approach the transition temperature of an ideal bose gas in the molecular limit , and can be included in the non - condensed phase ( @xmath27 ) through the nozires - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) fluctuation correction to the energy  @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 + \\tanh[\\frac{\\beta}{2}(\\xi_{{{\\mathbf p}}+{{\\mathbf q } } } - h)]}}{i\\omega + \\xi_{{{\\mathbf p } } } + \\xi_{{{\\mathbf p}}+{{\\mathbf q } } } } \\ ; .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this gives an estimate of the effect of pair fluctuations on the second order phase boundary ( but not the first order boundary , where @xmath30 ) .     and magnetisation @xmath31 ( inset ) versus interaction @xmath19 .",
    "there are four different phases : the normal ( n ) state , the phase - separated ( ps ) state , the ordinary superfluid ( sf ) and the magnetised superfluid ( sf@xmath32 ) . above the line @xmath33 , the normal state is completely polarised ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the red and black lines enclosing the ps state are both first - order phase boundaries , while the sf@xmath32-n transition is second - order , and the sf - sf@xmath32 transition ( green line ) is at least third - order .",
    "the tricritical point is represented by orange circles at @xmath35 with @xmath36 or @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : zerot],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "considerable insight can be gained by first examining the zero temperature mean - field phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] .",
    "the general structure parallels that of the two - channel case found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since there is a gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum @xmath37 of the unpolarised superfluid , the superfluid ground state will remain unchanged for @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the @xmath39 superfluid line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] corresponds to an _ area _ in the @xmath40 versus @xmath19 diagram , which expands as @xmath19 increases .",
    "a key feature of the strong coupling side is that for @xmath41 the superfluid state is able to sustain a finite population of majority quasiparticles .",
    "this `` gapless ''  @xcite superfluid phase is only stable for @xmath42 and it thus possesses only one fermi surface . in the extreme bec limit , this state is straightforwardly understood as an almost ideal mixture of bosonic pairs and fermionic quasiparticles . however , as we move towards unitarity , the bosons and fermions begin to interact more strongly , leading eventually to a first - order phase transition to the normal state . here , a system with fixed @xmath43 will undergo phase separation into normal and superfluid regions if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the magnetisation in the normal and superfluid phases at @xmath46 , the critical field for the first - order transition . in the bcs limit ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 which is less than the quasiparticle gap , so the superfluid state is unmagnetised @xmath49 , and phase separation occurs for arbitrarily low magnetisation , consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite . for the moment we neglect the fflo state , but will return to this point later .",
    "a crucial observation is that the line @xmath34 to the right of the region of phase separation can be thought of as a continuous zero temperature transition at which the condensate is totally depleted .",
    "it is thus natural to identify the point on @xmath34 where phase separation starts as a tricritical point . indeed a landau expansion of the free energy both confirms this and identifies the tricritical point at @xmath35 .     and interaction @xmath19 .",
    "the plane at temperature @xmath50 is the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] .",
    "the yellow line represents the locus of tricritical points calculated in the mean - field approximation , while the orange tricritical line corresponds to mean - field theory plus pair fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuation correction breaks down in the unitarity regime @xmath51 , and is thus shown as a dotted line .",
    "the slice at @xmath52 is based on a mean - field calculation and it shows the region of phase separation terminating in a tricritical point ( yellow circle ) at finite temperature , followed by a second - order phase transition from the superfluid to normal state .",
    "note that the boundary between the fflo and normal states ( blue line ) defines a small region of fflo phase confined to the bcs side of the crossover , as explained in the text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .",
    "the effective interaction is parameterised by the detuning @xmath53 .",
    "the colour scheme for tricritical lines is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tricritical].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    with this background , we now turn to the analysis of the fate of the tricritical point when temperature is finite , beginning with the mean - field description .",
    "it is well known that there exists a finite temperature tricritical point in the bcs limit @xmath54 , which is a natural consequence of having a first - order transition from the superfluid to normal state at @xmath50 and a second - order transition at @xmath39 .",
    "first studied by sarma in the context of superconductivity in the presence of a magnetic field  @xcite , the bcs tricritical point is located at @xmath55  @xcite , where @xmath56 $ ] ( i.e. at weak coupling all energies scale with @xmath22 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetisation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fermi surface density of states . to investigate how the bcs tricritical point is related to the one at zero temperature ,",
    "we must develop a perturbative expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) for small @xmath22 and general @xmath19 .",
    "doing so , one finds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tricritical ] ) that the tricritical point at @xmath34 is connected to that in the bcs limit by a line of tricritical points that passes through a maximum somewhere in the ` unitarity ' regime @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , for any given value of @xmath60 , the @xmath61 phase diagram is highly reminiscent of the @xmath0he-@xmath1he system , with @xmath31 playing the role of the fraction of @xmath0he .",
    "this is not surprising , as the finite @xmath43 system corresponds in general to a mixture of bosonic pairs and fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "note that even the gapped superfluid can be magnetised at finite temperature due to thermal excitation of quasiparticles . of course , at @xmath39",
    "the transition into the superfluid state is second order at any point in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "it is interesting to examine how the fflo phase fits in with the basic topology of the phase diagram . in the bcs limit",
    ", we already know that the point where the fflo - normal phase boundary meets the normal - superfluid boundary asymptotes to the tricritical point  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the transition from the fflo state to the normal state is second - order ( although ref .",
    "@xcite found it to be weakly first order , this will make a relatively small difference ) , and performing a mean - field analysis , we find that the fflo point of intersection leaves the finite temperature tricritical point with increasing interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tricritical ] ) , leading eventually to the extinction of the fflo phase at @xmath62 .",
    "note that although this treatment is somewhat approximate , as we have taken the sf - fflo boundary to be the same as the sf - n boundary in the absence of fflo , the point of intersection will coincide with that derived from a complete mean - field analysis .",
    "moreover , despite all our assumptions , we expect the detachment of the point of intersection from the tricritical point and the eventual disappearance of fflo to be robust features , since in the bec regime we essentially have a mixture of bosons and fermions . the inclusion of the fluctuation contribution eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) is crucial for recovering the extreme bec limit , where it is clear that the ( second - order ) transition temperature asymptotes to @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) , the ideal bec temperature of a gas of bosons of density @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 .",
    "more importantly , we find that fluctuations shift the mean - field tricritical line to lower temperatures and magnetisations on the bec side , while leaving the tricritical points on the bcs side largely unchanged , as expected .",
    "however , in a broad region around unitarity , we find that the approximation underlying eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) generally leads to non - monotonic behavior of @xmath67 , with @xmath68 for small @xmath8 .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as a breakdown of the nsr treatment , yielding an unphysical compressibility matrix @xmath69 that is not positive semi - definite .    to address this problem",
    ", we note that the nsr scheme is a controlled approximation when we introduce resonant scattering with a finite width , with the width being a small fraction of the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "the simplest such description is provided by the two - channel model  @xcite .",
    "the two - channel description of scattering depends upon two parameters : a detuning @xmath53 describing the distance from the resonance , and a width @xmath70 of the resonance measured in units of the fermi energy .",
    "the one - channel description is recovered in the @xmath71 limit , while the treatment of gaussian fluctuations is essentially perturbative in @xmath70 , with @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) being replaced with @xmath73 , so in this case the nsr treatment is expected to be accurate .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : tricritical_2chan ] .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram coincides with the result of ref .  @xcite . with fluctuations accounted for , and for sufficiently small @xmath70",
    ", we now find a well - behaved line of tricritical points spanning the crossover region .",
    "we expect that the true phase boundary at @xmath71 is qualitatively similar .     in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane .",
    "the red and black lines are first- and second - order phase boundaries , respectively .",
    "the arrows at constant @xmath75 represent the trajectories followed when going from the centre to the edges of a trapped gas .",
    "the two trajectories correspond to two different magnetisations of the gas : one greater and one less than the tricritical point @xmath76.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]",
    "we now discuss the consequences of our results for trapped gases studied in experiment . modeling the trapped gas by the local density approximation ( lda )",
    ", the spatial dependence of the density induced by the trapping potential @xmath77 is accounted for by a spatially - varying chemical potential @xmath78 , with @xmath8 kept constant . in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane , we thus move on a horizontal line ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tri_trap ] ) . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "a trapped gas will consist of a superfluid core surrounded by the normal state .",
    "the transition between normal and superfluid states in the trap can be either second or first order , depending on whether @xmath75 is above or below the tricritical point .",
    "moreover , as long as the temperature is non - zero , we can always find a sufficiently small @xmath8 so that @xmath75 lies above the tricritical point .",
    "this leads us to a key point : if a trapped gas at a given temperature and magnetisation has a first - order transition between its normal and superfluid phases , then we will _",
    "always _ cross the tricritical point by decreasing the magnetisation at fixed temperature .",
    "we emphasise that there are qualitative differences between first and second order transitions in a trap : the former yields a discontinuity in the density and magnetization at the phase interface , resulting in a form of phase separation as seen in recent experiments  @xcite , while the latter possesses a density that varies smoothly in space .",
    "therefore , the magnetisation and temperature at which a tricritical point is crossed should be detectable experimentally .",
    "in fact , a critical magnetisation for the onset of phase separation in a trap has been observed experimentally  @xcite , and a calculation by chevy supports the idea that this coincides with crossing a tricritical point  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the order of the transition will have an impact on experiments that use phase separation as a signature of superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a first - order transition in the trap can be even more pronounced if the density discontinuities result in a breakdown of lda .",
    "experiments on highly elongated traps already provide evidence for such a breakdown  @xcite , and one requires the addition of surface energy terms at the phase interface to successfully model the trapped density profiles  @xcite .",
    "an outstanding issue is the experimental detection of the gapless sf@xmath32 phase .",
    "while optically probing the momentum distribution of the minority species is one promising method for detecting sf@xmath32  @xcite , another possibility is to study density correlations using , for example , shot noise experiments as suggested in ref .",
    "a simple mean - field calculation gives ( for the uniform system ) : @xmath79 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the fermi - dirac distribution . at @xmath50 ,",
    "the result is a ` hole ' in the correlation function for momenta less than the fermi wavevector of the majority quasiparticles .",
    "such a measurement would therefore constitute both a confirmation of the sf@xmath32 phase and a vivid demonstration of the blocking effect of quasiparticles on @xmath81 pairing .    in conclusion",
    ", we have determined the structure of the finite temperature phase diagram of the two component fermi gas , as a function of both interaction strength and population imbalance , finding a region of phase separation terminating in a tricritical point for general coupling in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "a secondary result of our work is the demonstration that the nsr scheme yields unphysical results in a broad region around unitarity .",
    "this is significant , as it is widely viewed as offering a smooth , albeit uncontrolled approximation throughout the crossover .",
    "we emphasize that there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe in the accuracy of the nsr scheme without introducing an additional parameter , as we have done here .",
    "the ginzburg criterion governing the smallness of fluctuation corrections is satisfied in both the bcs limit where it takes the form @xmath82 , and in the bec limit where @xmath83 is the relevant criterion . but at unitarity the shift in the transition temperature relative to the mean field value will be of order @xmath84 . at the same time",
    "the upper critical dimension at the tricritical point is three , so we may expect that our results there will be little changed .    finally , we have argued that these tricritical points play an important role in experiments on trapped fermi gases ( see , also , the subsequent related work on trapped gases at unitarity by gubbels et al .",
    "indeed , a recent comprehensive study of the temperature dependence of the phase - separated state at unitarity has yielded experimental results consistent with the phase diagram outlined here  @xcite ."
