    "the properties of neutron - rich nuclei close to the drip - line are crucial for understanding fundamental mechanism governing the stability and formation of nuclei . in recent years",
    ", tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to the investigation of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the discoveries of light nuclei with halo structures have attracted great attention because of their exotic properties @xcite . and",
    "their important role in the big bang nucleosysnthesis @xcite . for the nitrogen isotopes ,",
    "many studies have focused on neutron - rich isotopes with mass number ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0n has rarely been investigated since its first production in 1998 @xcite . as a newly synthesized drip - line nucleus , many physical properties of @xmath0n such as the energy spectrum and the structure configuration",
    "have not been observed or predicted yet except for the one - neutron separation energy @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4s in @xmath5n and @xmath0n are respectively 1.28 mev and 1.79 mev , which are much smaller than that in @xmath1n of 4.59 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a first - order approximation , one can treat the @xmath0n nucleus as a three - body system composed by an inert @xmath1n core , which is tightly bound , and two valance neutrons moving at a relatively large distance away from the core .",
    "various few - body methods have been adopted to calculate different three - body quantum systems , such as the faddeev formalism @xcite , the equivalent two - body method @xcite , the green s function monte carlo @xcite , and the thsr ( tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ) wave function @xcite . among these different approaches ,",
    "the faddeev formalism has a specific advantage that it can also describe the three - body mechanism in a heavier system , which is normally encoded in microscopic calculations , in a computationally simpler way @xcite .",
    "various neutron - rich nuclei , including @xmath6he , @xmath7li , @xmath8be , @xmath9b , and @xmath5c have been investigated with the faddeev formalism @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been applied recently to proton - rich nuclei , such as @xmath9ne , @xmath10ne , and @xmath11s @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have applied the faddeev equations to the @xmath12n+n+n three - body system . by solving these equations ,",

    "we then introduce the jacobi coordinates , which include the hyper radius @xmath26 and the hyper - angle @xmath27 .",
    "they are related to the jacobi coordinates by @xcite @xmath28 one should notice that the hyper - radius is the same in different sets of jacobi representation , but the hyper - angles are different . to solve the faddeev equations , we adopt the hyperspherical harmonic method . using this approach",
    ", one can conveniently separate the hyper - angle and hyper - radial dependencies of the wave function . the hyperspherical decomposition of the i - th component of the wave function is defined as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the quantum numbers in the specific partial - wave channel occupied by the three - body system .",

    "we then apply the super symmetric transformation to this interaction to eliminate the spurious bound states which are forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "we discuss in this section the numerical results for calculating @xmath0n in a three - body model .",
    "we firstly discuss the physical model for the core and explain our choices of parameterization for the effective n-@xmath1n interaction , which are suitable to reproduce the experimental data . then we solve the faddeev equations and calculate the neutron - separation energies and configuration - space wave functions of @xmath0n .",

    "we make two assumptions in the shell - model description .",
    "firstly , we assume that the neutrons inside the @xmath1n core occupy the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 orbits , which are forbidden to be occupied by the valence neutrons due to the pauli principle @xcite . with the lack of the experimental information about the excited states in @xmath1n",

    "we also take into account the one - neutron separation energy of @xmath1n , which is related to the binding of the @xmath50 orbit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath51 mev . the experimental error of @xmath52 is considered in our calculations ; while the error bar of @xmath53 is neglected due to its relatively small size . by reproducing the upper bound , lower bound and mean value of @xmath52 , and also fixing the mean value of @xmath53",
    ", we determine three sets of parameters of the core - n interactions and list them in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "the corresponding root - mean - square ( r.m.s . ) radii of the core , the valence neutron and total matter in the @xmath1n - n two - body system are calculated with respect to different parameterizations and shown in table [ table : properties ] .",
    "the neutron density distributions of @xmath5n are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density distributions ] , where the probability density of the neutrons inside core and of the last neutron occupying the @xmath48 state , are shown respectively .",
    "we find that the last neutron has a much more extended matter density distribution than the neutrons inside the core do .",
    "this clearly indicates a halo structure in the @xmath1n - n system .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , we also analyze the correlation density distributions of the ground and excited states of @xmath0n in configuration space .",
    "these quantities are evaluated in the jacobi - coordinate representation with @xmath1n as the spectator particle , _ i.e. _ , in the third diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : jacobi coordinates ] .",
    "the spatial correlation density distribution is calculated as @xcite @xmath54 the correlation densities for the ground and excited states are shown in figs .",

    "the spatial separation in the excited state of @xmath0n supports the halo structure suggested above .",
    "furthermore , in fig .  [",

    "radius , and much more extended spatial distribution than the ground state , one may be able to describe the excited state as an efimov state in the halo nucleus  @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can utilize the geometrical similarity between the ground- and excited - state configurations to distinguish efimov states  @xcite : one of the magic properties of efimov physics is that two consecutive efimov states can be related to each other by a discrete spatial scaling factor  @xcite . in @xmath0n , the dominant parts of the spatial density distribution of the ground and excited states ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ground state ] and [ fig : excited state ] ) indicate that the configurations of @xmath0n in these two states have very similar shapes .",
    "moreover , the same ratio between @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the ground and excited states ( eq .  ) suggests that a discrete scaling symmetry exists between the two states .",
    "these features are highly consistent with the explanation of efimov states",
    ". however , further theoretical or experimental investigations are needed to confirm the excited state in @xmath0n .",
    "we have investigated the properties of @xmath0n as a three - body system consisting of an inert @xmath1n core and two valence neutrons .",
    "we apply the woods - saxon potential form to represent the effective @xmath1n - n interaction , and reproduce the basic characteristics of the @xmath5n . by solving the faddeev equations of the @xmath1n+n+n three - body system , implemented with the @xmath1n - n and n - n potentials , we calculate the bound - state observables in the @xmath0n ground state , where we obtain the two - neutron separation energy @xmath60 consistent with the experimental result .",
    "we also discover an excited @xmath0n with a much shallower two - neutron separation energy of 0.18 mev .",
    "we also calculate the r.m.s .",
    "matter radii for the two states .",
    "the obtained results suggest a relatively small halo structure for the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "a more extended distribution of the valance neutrons is unveiled in the excited state , which indicates an distinct halo structure .",
    "the average distances between the valence neutrons , the average distances from the core to the center - of - mass of the valence - neutron pair , and the spatial correlation density distributions of the two states in @xmath0n are also calculated to investigate the geometric structure of the three - body system .",
    "these results indicate that the two states have very similar triangular shapes and can be related to each other by a discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "these features suggest that the excited state of @xmath0n can be an efimov state .",
    "our calculations of @xmath0n with the faddeev formalism enable a new exploration toward the neutron drip line , and urge further experimental investigation of the @xmath0n ground state and the potential discovery of the @xmath0n excited state .",
