    "the high italian prices for electric energy are mainly due to the use of an expensive mix of fuels ( mainly oil and gas ) ; notice the large import of electric energy ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the use of solar energy and energy from the wind , both subject to variability , are compatible with the use of plants optimized for continuity of production .",
