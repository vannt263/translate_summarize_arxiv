    "secure communication against eavesdropping has drawn unprecedented attention from wireless researchers  @xcite due to a fast growing amount of private and sensitive data transmitted over wireless media . in some situations ,",
    "preventing eavesdropping is not enough and one wants to transmit covertly .",
    "for example , one may wish to communicate covertly to keep the privacy or avoid possible attacks .",
    "for some military operations , an army may want to communicate without being detected by the enemy in order to hide its presence or movement .",
    "considering additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels , a square root law was found in  @xcite .",
    "that is , with an arbitrarily low probability of being detected , one can reliably send at most @xmath0 bits over @xmath1 uses of the channel , which indicates that the asymptotic covert rate approaches zero .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the square root law can be broken when the warden has uncertainty about its receiver s noise power , and the asymptotic covert rate approaches a non - zero constant . in  @xcite ,",
    "the detection performance at the warden was analyzed by a worst - case approach from the warden s perspective , where the actual noise power is assumed to be at the worst - case scenario for the detection .",
    "such an approach to analyzing the detection performance with noise uncertainty was originally adopted in  @xcite for the study of spectrum sensing , where one wanted to ensure that secondary users can always detect the communication between primary users , even in the worst - case scenario .",
    "however , this approach has an important limitation for evaluating the detection performance at the warden for covert communication , since any true level of covertness can not be guaranteed by assuming a worst - case scenario from the warden s perspective .    in this work ,",
    "we restudy covert communication with the consideration of noise uncertainty . to address the limitation of the existing approach , we propose new approaches for evaluating the covertness of the systems with noise uncertainty .",
    "we analyze the systems with both bounded and unbounded models of the noise uncertainty , which are distinguished by whether the uncertainty range is finite .",
    "our analysis takes the distribution of noise uncertainty into account , and hence , gives new results on covertness significantly different from the existing analysis which simply considered the worst limit of noise uncertainty .",
    "we show that our approaches are appropriate to study the covertness of the system with either bounded or unbounded noisy uncertainty , while the existing approach overestimates the covertness of the system .",
    "consider the scenario where alice attempts to transmit messages to bob with a low probability of being detected by willie .",
    "we consider the awgn channel with real - valued signals .",
    "alice , bob , and willie each have a single antenna .",
    "the normalized transmitted signals from alice are denoted by @xmath2\\sim\\mathcal{n}\\left(0,1\\right)$ ] , where @xmath3 .",

    "willie attempts to distinguish the following two hypotheses : + @xmath12=v_w[n]$ ] and @xmath13=\\sqrt{p_t / r_w^\\alpha}x[n]+v_w[n]$ ] .",
    "+ based on the received vector @xmath14,\\cdots , y_w[n]\\right)$ ] , willie makes a binary decision on whether the received signal is noise or signal plus noise .",

    "denote @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the decisions that the received signal is noise and that the received signal is signal plus noise , respectively .",
    "the false alarm probability and the misdetection probability are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath20 denotes the probability measure .",
    "willie wishes to minimize @xmath21 and the ultimate objective of covert communication is to guarantee @xmath22 for a positive and arbitrarily small @xmath23 . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the case of @xmath24  @xcite , which allows willie to observe an infinite number of samples .",
    "denote the average received signal power at willie as @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 is known . without the noise uncertainty",
    ", we have the following approximations for the case of large @xmath27 from the central limit theorem  @xcite :    @xmath28 + @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the threshold of willie s detector and @xmath31 denotes the tail probability of the standard normal distribution .",
    "based on the above approximations , we have , as @xmath24 , @xmath32 if @xmath33 is known without uncertainty , willie can simply set any @xmath34 $ ] to ensure @xmath35 , which implies that willie can detect the communication without any error",
    ".      the lack of knowledge of the exact noise power is called noise uncertainty  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the sources of background noise include thermal noise , quantization noise , imperfect filters , ambient wireless signals , etc .",
    "noise uncertainty is almost unavoidable due to , e.g. , temperature change , environmental noise change , and calibration error .",
    "therefore , the consideration of noise uncertainty is practical and necessary for the study related to power detection .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in  @xcite and  @xcite , legitimate users can also intentionally generate interference signals to increase and ensure the noise uncertainty at willie for the purpose of covert communication .    in this work , we consider two models of the noise uncertainty at willie , which are detailed as follows .      for the bounded uncertainty model ,",

    "we further assume that @xmath42 is uniformly distributed in its uncertainty range in the db domain  @xcite .",
    "then , the log - uniform distribution of @xmath36 for the bounded uncertainty model is given by @xmath43      for the unbounded uncertainty model , the exact noise power @xmath36 does not necessarily lie in a finite range . instead ,",
    "@xmath44 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the difference between the exact noise power and the nominal noise power in the db domain follows a normal distribution  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath45 .",

    "as introduced in section  [ sec : sm_ht ] , the covertness is examined by @xmath48 . for a known noise power @xmath33 and detection threshold @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath49 is given by  .",
    "in what follows , we discuss the approach to analyzing the covertness with the consideration of noise uncertainty .",
    "we first point out a severe limitation of the existing approach adopted in  @xcite , and then introduce the newly - adopted approaches in this work .      in the existing work",
    "@xcite , a robust statistics approach was adopted to measure covertness with noise uncertainty .",
    "specifically , the upper limit of @xmath50 with noise uncertainty is adopted as the measure and is given by @xmath51 the requirement of covert communications is @xmath52 . note that characterizes the worst - case performance from willie s perspective .",
    "the robust statistics approach was originally adopted in  @xcite for the study of spectrum sensing with noise uncertainty where the aim is to ensure that users can always detect communications , even in the worst - case scenario .",
    "in contrast , for the purpose of covert communication , one wants to ensure that willies can not detect the communication .",
    "the robust statistics approach from willie s perspective is actually the most idealized ( non - robust ) approach to achieve covert communication from the legitimate user s perspective .    a system that achieves @xmath53 can not , in fact , guarantee any true level of covertness . for example , it is found in  @xcite that a system with @xmath54 can ensure that @xmath52 for an arbitrarily small @xmath23 , when the bounded uncertainty model of @xmath55 $ ] is adopted .",
    "however , a system with @xmath56 will result in @xmath57 as long as the exact noise power at willie is not at the worst - case limit .      in this work ,",
    "we adopt two new approaches to measure the covertness with noise uncertainty . instead of focusing on the worst - case scenario at willie",
    ", we analyze the overall performance at willie with the noise uncertainty .",
    "the two approaches are described as follows .",
    "the first approach is the bayesian statistics approach  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the average of @xmath50 over the a priori distribution of the noise power is adopted as the measure , which is given by @xmath58 we name @xmath59 as the average covert probability , and the requirement of covert communication is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the average covert probability captures the average covertness performance of the system over multiple times of communications / experiments .",
    "the second approach is the outage - based approach .",
    "specifically , the probability that @xmath61 is adopted as the measure , which is given by @xmath62 we name @xmath63 as the covert outage probability .",
    "the requirement of covert communication is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the maximum acceptable outage probability .",
    "the covert outage probability captures the probability that covert communication fails in such scenarios .",
    "note that the concept of covert outage probability is similar to the concept of secrecy outage probability  @xcite which characterizes the probability that secure communication fails .",
    "[ remark:2 ] both @xmath59 and @xmath63 depend on the a priori distribution of the noise power .",
    "therefore , the covertness depends on the uncertainty model of the noise power .",
    "mathematically , @xmath66 in this work with the consideration of @xmath67 , and the requirement of @xmath68 is equivalent to the requirement of @xmath69 .",
    "this is because @xmath49 in   is equal to either @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "however , the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath63 will be different when @xmath49 starts taking values within the range of @xmath72 , which happens in scenarios where willie has a finite number of samples  @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "now , we investigate the maximum rate at which alice can reliably communicate with bob subject to a constraint on the average covert probability , namely , the covert rate . denoting the covert rate as @xmath73",
    ", the problem is formulated as    [ ] @xmath74    as explained in remark  [ remark:2 ] , the requirement of @xmath75 is equivalent to the requirement of @xmath69 in this work .",
    "thus , we do not consider the requirement of @xmath64 in this section . in the following ,",
    "we derive the covert rate in systems with different models of noise uncertainty . for each model",
    ", we first obtain the received power threshold at willie below which @xmath60 , and then present the corresponding covert rate .      the noise power at willie is assumed to follow a log - uniform distribution given by  .",
    "[ theo : pthbayes ] with the log - uniformly distributed noise power , the received power threshold at willie below which @xmath60 is given by @xmath76    the detailed proof is omitted here due to space limitation .",
    "instead , the important steps in the proof are given as follows :    if @xmath77 , willie can set @xmath78 to have @xmath79 , so that he can detect the communication without any error .",
    "we then focus on the case that @xmath80 .",
    "one can find that willie s optimal detection threshold is @xmath81 with  , we have @xmath82 solving the inequality @xmath83 for @xmath26 completes the proof .",
    "[ remark:3 ] we note from   that @xmath84 as @xmath85 , which indicates that a sufficiently small @xmath26 is required to ensure an arbitrarily small @xmath23 .",
    "we also note from   that @xmath86 as @xmath87 , which is equal to the threshold to ensure @xmath52 with @xmath85 ; see  .",
    "therefore , we confirm that a designed system based on the measure of @xmath88 can not guarantee any true level of covertness .    with  , the transmit power is limited by @xmath89 .",
    "the covert rate for systems with a log - uniformly distributed noise power at willie is given by @xmath90      the noise power at willie is assumed to follow the log - normal distribution given by  .",
    "the closed - form expression for the power threshold is mathematically intractable due to the complicated expression of @xmath91 in  .",
    "instead , we give an approximated power threshold in the following proposition .",
    "[ theo : pthbayes_lognormal ] with the log - normally distributed noise power , the received power threshold at willie below which @xmath60 is approximated by @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 denotes the error function , and @xmath97 denotes the inverse error function .    the detailed proof is omitted here due to space limitation .",
    "instead , the important steps in the proof are given as follows :    when the level of noise uncertainty is small , the expression for @xmath98 in   can be approximated by a gaussian function  @xcite , given by @xmath99 with  , one can find that willie s optimal detection threshold is @xmath100 .",
    "we then have @xmath101 solving the inequality @xmath83 for @xmath26 completes the proof .",
    "we note from   that @xmath102 as @xmath85 .",
    "we also note from   that @xmath103 as @xmath87 , which , in fact , would be the threshold to ensure @xmath52 with @xmath85 under the unbounded uncertainty model .",
    "intuitively , it is unreasonable that we could achieve covert communication with an arbitrarily large power so long as willie has an unbounded noise uncertainty model .",
    "thus , we again confirm that @xmath88 is not appropriate in evaluating the covertness of systems with noise uncertainty .    with  ,",
    "the transmit power is limited by @xmath104 .",
    "the covert rate for systems with a log - normally distributed noise power at willie is given by @xmath105",
    "we first examine the accuracy of the obtained approximation of @xmath106 given in proposition  2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : appcheck ] compares the approximated @xmath107 in   and the numerically obtained @xmath107 by monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the nominal noise power at willie in the db domain is @xmath108 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the approximations match precisely with the simulations .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation improves as the variance of the noise decreases , and the approximation error is almost unnoticeable for the case of @xmath109 .",
    ".,width=211,height=172 ]    [ fig : appcheck ]    we now show the covert rates of systems with different levels of noise uncertainty at willie .",
    "figure  [ fig : lun](a ) plots @xmath110 versus @xmath111 for the bounded noise uncertainty model with log - uniformly distributed noise power at willie , while figure  [ fig : lun](b ) plots @xmath112 versus @xmath113 for the unbounded noise uncertainty model with log - normally distributed noise power at willie .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath114 and @xmath115 ,  where @xmath116 . for comparison ,",
    "the curve of  prior result \" in figure  [ fig : lun](a ) represents the achievable covert rate with an arbitrarily small probability of being detected derived in the prior work  @xcite , which adopted @xmath88 to measure the covertness .",
    "the curve of  prior result \" is not shown in figure  [ fig : lun](b ) , since the achievable covert rate based on @xmath88 always goes to infinity . as depicted in the figures , the covert rate increases as willie s noise uncertainty increases and/or the required @xmath23 increases .",
    "the covert rate approaches zero if willie does not have uncertainty of his noise power , i.e. , @xmath117 . according to our analysis ,",
    "the covert rate still approaches zero as @xmath23 approaches zero subject to any level of noise uncertainty .",
    "we note that the prior result is much larger than the achievable covert rate according to our analysis .",
