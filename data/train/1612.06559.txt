    "in the earlier epoch , the universe was in the fully ionized phase . with the expansion of the universe , the temperature of igm decreased and",
    "protons combined with electrons to form hydrogens .",
    "this process is named recombination and occurs at the redshift @xmath2 .",
    "after the recombination , the universe went into the epoch named `` dark age '' . the most exciting way of detecting the `` dark age '' is to observe the 21 cm background signal .",
    "the 21 cm signal is caused by the transition of hyperfine split ( @xmath3 ) of the hydrogen .",
    "it is the result of the competition among the temperature of baryonic gas ( @xmath4 ) , radiation ( @xmath5 ) and spin ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , the energy injection during the dark age will affect @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and left imprint on the 21 cm background signal  @xcite .    as a kind of extra source , dark matter annihilation can also affect the 21 cm signal .",
    "the basic idea is that the dark matter annihilation productions , e.g. photons ( @xmath8 ) , electrons ( @xmath9 ) and positrons ( @xmath10 ) , have interactions with the particles which are present in the universe causing the heating , ionization and excitation of igm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature @xmath7 and @xmath6 will be affected and changed . due to the factor that dark matter annihilation rate is proportional to the number density square of particles , the influence of dark matter annihilation on igm",
    "can be studied using the 21 cm background signal  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new kind of dark matter structure named ultracompact dark matter minihalos ( ucmhs ) was proposed  @xcite .",
    "they can be formed in the early universe via the collapse of large density perturbations , @xmath11 . compared with the general dark matter halos , the density profile of ucmhs is steeper , @xmath12 , and the formation time is earlier , @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , it is excepted that the dark matter annihilation rate is large within ucmhs .",
    "several works have discussed the gamma - ray flux and neutrino flux from ucmhs due to the dark matter annihilation or decay  @xcite . due to the large annihilation rate of dark matter within ucmhs , the gamma - ray or neutrino flux from ucmhs",
    "can exceed the threshold of some detectors or the atmosphere neutrino background . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated the effects of ucmhs on the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background and the structure formation due to the dark matter annihilation . in this paper",

    "dark matter as an essential component of the universe has been confirmed while its nature is still unknown . at present , the mostly researched model is the weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the typical mass of wimps is @xmath14 gev @xmath15 tev , and the thermally averaged cross section is @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to explain the gamma - ray excess of the milky way center the dark matter particle mass would be @xmath17 gev , e.g. ref .",
    "the observations on the positrons and electrons of the cosmic ray imply that the dark matter particle mass is @xmath18 tev and the thermally averaged cross section is @xmath19 , e.g. see the review  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , after the analysis of @xmath8-ray data of the milky way dsphs from the fermi - lat the authors excluded the thermally averaged cross section @xmath20 for the dark matter particle mass @xmath21 .",
    "the observational results of h.e.s.s towards the galactic center for the very high energy @xmath8-ray flux show that there is no a residual @xmath8-ray flux in the energy range between @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite , and the thermally averaged cross section which is larger than @xmath24 is excluded for the einasto density profile .    in this paper , we will focus on the general case , @xmath14 gev with @xmath25 , and our results can be applied for the other cases . for the cosmological parameters , we used the results given by the planck collaboration  @xcite .",

    "the main conclusions and discussions are given in sec .",
    "the ground state of hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) can split into triplet and singlet states , which is named hyperfine structure .",
    "the energy change of these two levels is @xmath26 ev which corresponds to the wavelength of photon @xmath27 cm .",
    "the transition between two states is usually expressed in the form of spin temperature , @xmath6 , which is defined as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number density of hydrogens in triplet and singlet states , @xmath31 k is the equivalent temperature corresponding to the transition energy . during the evolution of the universe , there are mainly three processes which have influence on the spin temperature ( i ) the background photons , e.g. comic microwave background ( cmb ) , which can be absorbed by hydrogen atoms ; ( ii ) the collisions of the hydrogen atoms with other particles , such as hydrogen atoms , electrons and protons ; ( iii ) the resonant scattering of ly@xmath32 photons which is named the wouthuysen - field effect . including these effects , the spin temperature can be written as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 corresponds to the wouthuysen - field effect , and in this work we use the form as  @xcite    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the einstein coefficient of the hyperfine spontaneous transition .",

    "if the density perturbations are larger than @xmath61 the primordial black holes can be formed .",
