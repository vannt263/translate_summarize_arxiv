    "although a consensus on the basic @xmath2 symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in most cuprate materials is now established @xcite , the possibility of further symmetry breaking due to the presence of competing ground states has been widely discussed , both on theoretical and experimental grounds .",
    "one of the possible additional order parameters is a secondary superconducting gap of different symmetry . in the resulting mixed - gap state , the minimum free energy is usually taken for complex order parameters like @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which implies the violation of time - reversal invariance ( that we will call @xmath6-breaking ) , in addition to the broken u(1 ) symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "experimentally , the observed splitting of the zero - bias conductance peak @xcite of tunneling experiments in the overdoped regime of yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite has been interpreted as evidence for a @xmath6-breaking mixed - gap state . however , the precise nature of this mixed gap is not entirely clear , as a number of studies reduce to tentative fits of the tunneling spectra using the different gap structures allowed by symmetry @xcite .",
    "we also point out that the signature of such a mixed gap has remained elusive in other physical probes .",
    "surface effects may play a role , as a small secondary gap can be induced by the proximity to interfaces @xcite , although other mechanisms based on competing pairing attractions @xcite , magnetic fields effects @xcite and presence of magnetic impurities @xcite have been proposed .",
    "it is worthwile mentioning that a quantum phase transition , associated with the passage from the pure @xmath2-wave phase to the mixed superconducting state , would provide a source of anomalous scattering of the nodal quasiparticles in the quantum critical regime @xcite .",
    "photoemission measurements in optimally doped bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath10 @xcite have indicated the presence of such critical scattering , however , experimental details have not been fully sorted out .    in electron - doped",
    "cuprates the situation appears to be different , as several experiments on pr@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath13 indicated a rather sharp transition from a @xmath2-wave to a @xmath1-wave state as a function of doping @xcite .",
    "therefore a mixed - gap phase could at best be present in a narrow region of the phase diagram .    of course ,",
    "in addition other symmetries could be broken in those materials , such as the lattice symmetry ( denoted @xmath14-breaking in the following ) .",
    "indeed , theoretical studies of models for doped mott insulators have demonstrated the possibility of several different ordering patterns , such as bond ( or spin - peierls ) order @xcite , stripes @xcite , and staggered flux states @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "neutron scattering measurements revealed stripe formation in la@xmath11sr@xmath15cuo@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "more recently , signatures of charge order were observed by tunneling experiments in the superconducting phase of bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath10 @xcite , giving further evidence that competing orders may be generic to these materials .    in this paper , we argue that disorder plays a significant role for competing instabilities in unconventional superconductors , by possibly suppressing or enhancing the tendency for the system to form complex symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "a basic remark is that non - magnetic impurities are known to strongly suppress the pure @xmath2-wave state , while usual @xmath1-wave superconductors are extremely robust to the addition of static disorder , according to the famous anderson s theorem @xcite .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the competition of pairing states with different symmetry .",
    "first , a putative phase transition such as @xmath17 could be tuned by varying the disorder strength ( e.g. using irradiation or addition of impurities ) .",
    "second , we can expect that order parameters of @xmath4 and @xmath5 types should behave quite differently to the addition of non - magnetic impurities , and this effect ( which is discussed in more detail below ) could be used to experimentally discriminate among the several gap structures discussed for cuprate and other unconventional superconductors .    to gain some physical understanding , the first part of this paper is devoted to the simplest theory of disorder in superconductors with a two - component gap .",
    "we argue that the bcs formalism together with a self - consistent t - matrix approximation @xcite is enough to capture the essential features of the problem , although quantum critical dynamics  @xcite , localization phenomena  @xcite and non - uniform pairing patterns  @xcite are not described by our calculation . in particular , some of our results obtained in the strong disorder regime should be taken with some caution due to the development of strongly inhomogeneous regions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will be able to determine the phase diagram as a function of the impurity concentration and of the ratio of two competing pairing attractions , which can be expected to be qualitatively correct .",
    "previous studies of this problem @xcite were devoted to the calculation of the critical temperature in the ginzburg - landau formalism , and to our knowledge the solution of the bcs problem with disorder for @xmath4 and @xmath5 superconductors was not investigated in detail .",
    "we shall demonstrate that disorder generates and stabilizes an @xmath1-wave part in the @xmath4 situation .",
    "this result is due to the combination of two remarkable properties of superconductors : the insensitivity of the @xmath1-wave gap to disorder ( anderson s theorem ) and the presence of a finite density of states in a disordered @xmath2-wave state , leading inevitably to a secondary bcs instability in the @xmath1-channel at low temperature ( a similar result was discussed in @xcite , but here we are able to provide a more transparent physical picture ) . because anderson s theorem does not hold for a @xmath5 superconductor , the effect of disorder in this case is quite similar to the pure @xmath2-wave case : superconductivity is rapidly destroyed , and no emergent order parameter can follow from impurity addition .",
    "because of these two different situations , we propose that disorder can be used in practice to distinguish the two debated scenarios in overdoped yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , and hope to stimulate new experimental studies .    the second part of the paper concerns the sensitivity to disorder of superconductors with spontaneous lattice symmetry breaking , motivated both by stripes physics and possible charge ordering in cuprates . for simplicity , and because of the local nature of the t - matrix approximation ,",
    "we restrict our attention to superconductors with additional bond order , and demonstrate that the non - magnetic impurities have a general tendency to restore in an extremely fast manner the global translation symmetry .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we concentrate on translation - invariant dirty superconductors with mixed gap symmetry , and develop the basic formalism , referring the reader to appendix  [ app1 ] for technical details .",
    "we investigate in turn the @xmath4 and @xmath5 cases , discussing the evolution of the superconducting gap as a function of the impurity concentration and of the ratio of attractive interactions in the two channels . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we study the more general problem of the influence of disorder on superconductors that combine u(1 ) and lattice symmetry breaking . the complete derivation of the t - matrix formalism is given in appendix  [ app2 ]",
    ". a general discussion of disorder effects in cuprates is given in sec .",
    "iv , together with a summary which will close the paper .",
    "most of the numerical calculations are performed assuming strong impurities , i.e. , unitary - limit scatterers .",
    "however , we expect the qualitative results to be insensitive to details of the disorder potential .",
    "in this section we will investigate the instabilities of a two - component superconductor using the weak - coupling bcs theory , owing to the fact that strong - coupling effects would only modify quantitatively the results , according to previous results in the eliashberg framework @xcite .",
    "however , the quantum - critical dynamics near the phase transition between states of different pairing symmetry @xcite can not be accounted for in our formalism , as fluctuations of the order parameter are discarded in the mean - field approximation .    introducing a general pairing attaction @xmath18 in the singlet channel , which corresponds to",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath19 the complex superconducting gap @xmath20 obeys the bcs equation , @xmath21 , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature and @xmath23 the matsubara frequency . in the following",
    ", we will assign the two real gap functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 to two different representations of the lattice symmetry group , keeping the global phase of the order parameter fixed .",
    "further , @xmath26 is the single - particle green s function of the nambu spinor @xmath27 .",
    "it can be decomposed as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the pauli matrices , and @xmath31 is the identity matrix .",
    "the green s function is determined by dyson s equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the quasiparticle dispersion and the contribution of impurity scattering to the electronic self - energy is @xmath34 .",
    "we have precedently introduced the frequency - dependent renormalized quantities : @xmath35    we will determine @xmath36 in the self - consistent t - matrix approximation , which employs the exact solution of the single impurity problem . if we note by @xmath37 the static potential generated by a given impurity , the t - matrix obeys the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite : @xmath38 in the case of a finite impurity concentration , @xmath39 , the t - matrix approximation amounts to the neglect of interference effects between different impurities .",
    "the main limitation is that localization effects @xcite are ignored , which may be important in low - dimensional systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; also , the occurence of inhomogeneous states due to disorder can not be accounted for @xcite . within the t - matrix approach ,",
    "disorder averaging effectively restores translation invariance , and the disorder - induced self - energy is given by the relation : @xmath40 for simplicity , we will assume a local potential , @xmath41 , so that the solution is easily found : @xmath42 where we have introduced the local green s function : @xmath43 equations  ( [ bcs]),([dyson]),([sigma]),([gloc ] ) constitute the starting point of our analysis and must be solved in a fully self - consistent manner . in the following two paragraphs , we will specialize to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 cases respectively , which will allow to carry out further the analysis .",
    "we consider here an attractive pairing potential in both @xmath1 and @xmath2-wave channels @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angle specifying the direction of @xmath46 in polar coordinates .",
    "this results in @xmath4 superconducting order : @xmath47 ordered states with a relative phase between the two components different from @xmath48 , such as @xmath49 , are easily shown to have a higher free energy @xcite , and will not be considered here . here and in the following , we employ the continuum limit , which also corresponds to the infinite bandwidth limit for the electronic dispersion .",
    "particle - hole symmetry then implies @xmath50 , whereas the fact that the @xmath0-wave part of the gap averages to zero on the fermi surface gives @xmath51 . performing the @xmath46 summation in  ( [ gloc ] ) we find the green s functions : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fermionic density of states",
    ", @xmath54 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite , and we defined @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] . using the self - energy  ( [ sigma ] ) , we find that the renormalized frequency  ( [ wt ] ) is determined by the relation : @xmath56 the renormalized @xmath1-wave gap @xmath57 is given by an equation similar to  ( [ wt_sid ] ) , which we can write in the following way : @xmath58 this important relation will be central to the later physical discussion .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath51 implies @xmath59 , so that the @xmath0-wave gap does not acquire a self - energy correction in eq .",
    "( [ wt2 ] ) .    the momentum summation in the gap equation  ( [ bcs ] ) can be performed similarly , and leads to @xmath60 in the @xmath1-wave channel , while the @xmath2 gap is determined by : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is complete elliptic integral of the second kind @xcite .",
    "the primed summation indicates that a frequency cutoff @xmath63 needs to be introduced ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this procedure is crucial in order to preserve anderson s theorem in a superconductor with non - retarded interaction such as  ( [ v_sid ] ) . indeed",
    ", the use of a finite energy bandwidth together with an unbounded frequency sum would violate this basic result @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could employ a retarded pairing interaction from the outset , without restricting the frequency summation , however , this procedure would significantly complicate the analysis without modifying the results .",
    "we now consider an attractive pairing potential in both @xmath3 and @xmath2-wave channels : @xmath64 this leads to a @xmath5 superconducting order : @xmath65 arguments discussed previously give @xmath66 , so that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are not renormalized .",
    "the only non - zero local propagator is : @xmath69 where @xmath70^{-1/2}$ ] , with the definitions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "there is therefore a single equation to solve for the renormalized frequency : @xmath73    setting @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we finally express the two gap equations : @xmath76 \\\\",

    ". then we study the fate of the critical point in the presence of disorder .",
    "finally we present the phase diagram obtained from the numerical solution .",
    "it is useful to recall the nature of the ground state in a superconductor with competing @xmath1 and @xmath0-wave instabilities .",
    "let us first consider the possible occurence of an @xmath1-wave instability in a clean well - formed @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "basically , the bcs singularity is cut off by the presence of the @xmath2-wave gap , as shown by the fact that the propagator behaves as @xmath77 in the gap equation  ( [ gap1_sid ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath78 to zero in this equation , one sees that a _ finite _ critical interaction @xmath79 is necessary to trigger the @xmath1-wave instability , in contrary to the situation in a normal metal . from the same argument ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave state is stable at small @xmath80 up to a critical value of @xmath80 where the additional @xmath0-wave order parameter develops .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that there exists a finite range domain in which both orders coexist at zero temperature ( see @xcite and appendix  [ app1 ] ) : @xmath81 for instance , the quantum critical point associated to the transition @xmath17 occurs when couplings obey @xmath82 and can be described by a field theory involving the coupling of nodal quasiparticles to ising fluctuations associated to the additional @xmath1-wave order @xcite .",
    " clearly , this description lies beyond the scope of the present mean - field analysis .",
    "[ [ s - wave - instability - in - a - dirty - d_x2-y2-wave - background ] ] @xmath1-wave instability in a dirty @xmath2-wave background ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    let us start with an important remark on the effect of disorder in @xmath1-wave superconductor ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the local propagator  ( [ g0_sid ] ) reads @xmath84 where we have used the relation  ( [ crucial ] ) to get the r.h.s .",
    "all renormalization factors in @xmath85 drop out , and therefore the gap equation  ( [ gap1_sid ] ) of the pure @xmath1-wave superconductor is _ unchanged _ by the presence of disorder , in accordance with anderson s statement . for the pure @xmath0-wave case ,",
    "no such cancellation occurs , and the gap is rapidly suppressed when a few percent of impurities are added .",
    "we note that , in reality , anderson s theorem holds to order @xmath39 @xcite , so that the strict insensitivity of @xmath78 to disorder here is actually an artefact of the t - matrix approximation .",
    "we now consider a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( @xmath86 ) containing a small amount of disorder ( such that the gap @xmath68 is not completely driven to zero ) . from  ( [ wt_sid ] ) , assuming unitary scattering ( @xmath87 ) but small impurity concentration ( @xmath88 ) , we find the renormalized frequency @xmath89 at @xmath90 ( up to logarithmic corrections coming from the elliptic function ) .",
    "this leads to the density of states at the fermi level : @xmath91 i.e. a _ finite _ density of states is generated at low energy due to the pair breaking effect of the non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "this result is also valid in the born limit of small scattering potential @xmath92 , although @xmath93 is exponentially small in @xmath39 in this case @xcite .",
    "experimentally , scatterers in high-@xmath94 materials appear to be closer to the unitary limit .",
    "now , we focus on the @xmath1-wave attraction and study the related bcs equation  ( [ gap1_sid ] ) in the presence of this disorder - induced density of states @xmath93 . by similarity to the bcs instability in a normal metal , we would naively say that any infinitesimal @xmath79 would lead to a finite @xmath1-wave gap @xmath78 .",
    "as we will see in the later case of the @xmath5 superconductor , this argument is true provided anderson s theorem is fulfilled , which is the case for @xmath4 superconductors only . indeed",
    "the bcs equation  ( [ gap1_sid ] ) can be re - expressed using again relation  ( [ crucial ] ) : @xmath95 because @xmath96 is finite at zero frequency in a dirty @xmath0-wave superconductor , a @xmath97 singularity is generated at vanishing @xmath78 and the weak - coupling bcs instability to the @xmath4 state occurs , in accordance with our intuitive argument .",
    "let us summarize this interesting result : _ due to anderson s theorem , an arbitrarily small @xmath1-wave component of the pairing potential will always generate an @xmath1-wave contribution to the order parameter in a disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor_. of course the critical temperature for the onset of the @xmath1-wave gap is exponentially small in the disorder - induced density of states ( up to multiplicative factors ) : latexmath:[\\ ] ] where we have defined : @xmath215 taking into account the contribution from site @xmath216 , and in the unitary limit @xmath103 , we find the final expression  ( [ tmatrix ] ) ."
