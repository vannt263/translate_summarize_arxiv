    "simple models of dna thermal denaturation have attracted a lot of attention for a long time @xcite . although it was pointed out rather early that excluded volume effects may be crucial in determining the order of the denaturation transition @xcite , it was only very recently that such effects were taken into account both at analytical and numerical level @xcite .",
    "even once accepted excluded volume effects as a key factor in determining the nature of the transition , one can still be interested in understanding how the relaxation of self - avoidance constraints influences the overall behavior of the system . as this can be done in different ways , learning in detail about the effects of different geometrical exclusion constraints can help in conceiving better models or more efficient approximations .",
    "the main general aim of this paper is that of producing a contribution to the debate on these general issues . in particular we analyze the model of dna denaturation recently introduced and studied by garel , monthus and orland ( gmo ) @xcite . among other things ,",
    "we show that this model is a rather ideal context in which a recently proposed representation of dna in terms of block copolymer networks @xcite can be applied .",
    "the hamiltonian for the gmo model is @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 describe the conformations of the two strands as functions of the curvilinear coordinate @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the attractive interaction between homologous base pairs ( @xmath7 ) . the last term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ hamin ] ) is due to excluded volume interactions , which act only between the two chains and not within a single chain .",
    "thus the self - avoidance constraint is relaxed and each isolated strand follows a simple random walk ( rw ) statistics .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite simplified further the hamiltonian ( [ hamin ] ) by approximating the excluded volume term by a long range interaction between the strands , which allows for an analytical solution of the problem . within such approximation , the denaturation transition turns out to be of first order type @xcite , as in models where excluded volume effects are fully incorporated @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to clarify further this point .",
    "we start from a description _  la _ poland - sheraga ( ps ) @xcite of the gmo model and use a series of exact results on reunion exponents of mutually avoiding walks , which show indeed that the denaturation transition is first order .",
    "more surprisingly , the transition turns out to be even sharper than that occurring in models where excluded volume effects are fully taken into account .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by approximate analytical treatments of excluded volume effects due to loop - loop interactions and by a series of numerical results obtained for polymer lattice models in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "0.2truecm    in the poland - sheraga ( ps ) model @xcite the dna chain is treated approximately as a sequence of non - interacting bound double segments and denaturated loops . within this scheme the full partition function @xmath10 for a chain whose constituent strands have lengths @xmath11 , is factorized in terms of elementary partition functions for loops and segments ( see fig .",

    ", the total partition function reads @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the grand canonical partition functions for loops and double segments , respectively .",
    "the form of the numerator @xmath16 depends on boundary conditions and is not interesting for our purposes .",
    "the crucial quantity is the loop partition function , which in the most general form reads @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ( non - universal ) effective connectivity constant , while @xmath1 is a universal exponent .",
    "the order of the transition is related to the value of @xmath1 @xcite : at the transition temperature ( which in the ps model corresponds to @xmath19 ) loops are power - law distributed in size with probability @xmath20 , thus their average size @xmath21 is finite for @xmath0 , implying a first order denaturation , while it diverges for @xmath22 and the transition becomes continuous .    for self- and mutually avoiding strands @xmath1",
    "was estimated analytically in an extended ps scheme @xcite , where excluded volume effects between a self - avoiding loop and the rest of the chain are approximately taken into account .",
    "this exponent was also obtained directly by monte carlo simulations @xcite for polymer lattice models .",
    "the agreement between the analytical estimates and simulation results for @xmath1 is very good both in @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .    in the next sections we will present analytical and numerical estimates of the exponent @xmath1 for the gmo model .",
    "the former are based on the general theory of copolymer networks , which is briefly reviewed in the appendix .    0.2truecm",
    "a denaturated loop in the gmo model is formed by two mutually avoiding random walks of equal length @xmath23 , with common origin and endpoint ( see example of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the probability that two random walks , with common origin , meet for the first time after @xmath23 steps decays asymptotically as @xmath20 with @xcite : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the dimensionality of the embedding space , @xmath26 for rws and @xmath27 denotes the contribution of a vertex from which the two walks originate ( see fig . [ fig02 ] ) .",
    "we follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite and indicate with @xmath28 the exponent associated to a vertex from which @xmath29 solid and @xmath30 dashed lines depart , at the gaussian fixed point , which is the relevant one for our purposes . at this fixed point",
    "solid and dashed lines do not interact with themselves , but they avoid the lines of the other group .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] , as well as figs .",
    "[ fig03]-[fig05 ] below , are examples of so called _ copolymer networks _ , i.e. networks whose constituents are polymers of different species .",
    "the relevance of these block copolymer networks for a description of denaturating dna has been already stressed in the context of models with full excluded volume effects @xcite .",
    "a general network of this type may be made , for instance , by an arbitrary mixture of random and self - avoiding walks ( saws ) .",
    "any pair of these walks may either avoid , or be allowed to cross each other . as for the homopolymer case ,",
    "the general entropic exponent for a network with arbitrary topology follows from those of the constituents vertex exponents ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . the general rule to calculate",
    "the entropic exponent of a network is simple and it is reviewed in the appendix .",
    "restricting to the case in which all constituent polymers have the same @xmath31 exponent , one associates to each independent loop a factor @xmath32 and to each vertex a factor @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the appropriate exponent which depends on the number of outgoing legs , and on their type .",
    "the generalization to an arbitrary mixture of polymer segments with distinct @xmath31 s , as for instance rws and saws , is also possible .",
    "coming back to eq .",
    "( [ cisolated ] ) , the vertex exponent for one solid and one dashed line is known exactly in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "its value is @xmath35 , which leads to @xmath36 . in higher dimensions one has to resort to @xmath37 expansion renormalization group results . in @xmath9 resummation techniques",
    "yield @xmath38 @xcite , which implies @xmath39 .",
    "thus , both in @xmath40 and @xmath41 the reunion exponent is larger than the threshold value ( @xmath0 ) , which immediately implies a first order denaturation for the gmo model , within the ps picture of non - interacting loops and bound segments .    as a comparison we recall that for an isolated loop made by two self- and mutually avoiding strands the entropic exponent is @xcite : @xmath42 for a saw one has @xmath43 in @xmath8 , which implies @xmath44 , while @xmath45 in @xmath9 , implying @xmath46 .",
    "thus , within the ps picture , denaturation is a continuous transition ( @xmath47 ) when full self- avoidance within a single loop is included @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to go beyond the ps approximation in the gmo model , but it is already quite clear at this point that excluded volume effects between a single loop and the rest of the chain `` localize '' even more the loops and @xmath1 can only increase .",
    "this can be shown explicitly for some simple geometries in which the loop is embedded .",
    "the calculations follow closely those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the model in which self - avoidance is fully included and are also briefly reviewed in the appendix .",
    "we give here only the final results .",
    "0.2truecm    we consider the geometry shown in fig .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] where the two possible distinct types of vertices with four outgoing lines , two solid and two dashed , are shown . for a vertex of type ( a ) more configurations",
    "are possible as neighboring lines of the same type are allowed to overlap . in ( b ) , instead , the distinction between solid and dashed lines becomes irrelevant as neighboring lines avoid each other . in the latter case the lines form a vertex of four mutually avoiding walks ( maws ) @xcite .",
    "a vertex with @xmath52",
    "outgoing maws , has an associated entropic exponent @xcite : @xmath53 hence , for loops embedded in a geometry as in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , and formed by vertices of type ( b ) one finds @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider now vertices of type ( a ) for which we keep the notation @xmath55 to indicate the associated exponent .",
    "using the prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite one has @xmath56 and thus from eq .",
    "( [ cinteracting ] ) @xmath57 .",
    "notice that stronger excluded volume effects ( as for vertices of type ( b ) ) imply a higher value for @xmath1 , with a quite large difference between the two estimated values .",
    "we point out that , obviously , @xmath58 in all dimensions .    in @xmath9",
    "the above subtleties do not occur .",
    "the vertex exponent @xmath59 was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite using @xmath37 expansions and resummation techniques .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ cinteracting ] ) , one obtains @xmath60 .",
    "we consider now another geometry , where a loop is connected to two long double stranded segments , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] . using the same method of ref .",
    "@xcite we find ( see appendix ) : @xmath61 where with @xmath62 we indicate the exponent associated to a vertex where one double , and two single stranded segments join .",
    "notice that the double stranded segment is actually a self avoiding walk since , if it would overlap itself in some part , the mutual avoidance condition between the two constituent strands would be violated .",
    "0.2truecm    again in @xmath8 one can use the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite to find @xmath63 which leads to @xmath64 .",
    "to our knowledge , there exists no field theoretical analysis for this type of vertices in higher dimensions , thus we are not able to make any predictions for @xmath1 in @xmath9 , at present .",
    "table [ table01 ] summarizes the exponents found in the gmo model for an isolated loop ( @xmath65 ) , for a loop interacting with other loops ( @xmath66 ) , as in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , and for a loop interacting with double stranded segments ( @xmath67 ) , as in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "for the two dimensional case we reported both values of @xmath66 corresponding to the loops formed by the two types of vertices of fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "we notice that , as anticipated above , the interaction with other parts of the chain has the effect of increasing the loop exponent @xmath68 as is the case for all other models studied so far @xcite .",
    "the first order character of the transition in the gmo model is therefore strengthened .",
    "it is interesting to compare the exponents obtained in this paper with the corresponding ones for the model in which strands are fully self - avoiding ( fsa ) .",
    "the latter , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , are given in table [ table01 ] .",
    "the comparison between the two models indicates that the transition in the gmo model is generally sharper ( higher @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is always true with the exception of the exponent @xmath69 in @xmath8 for vertices of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig04](a ) for which we find @xmath70 , for the gmo model , while @xmath71 in the fsa case .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the gmo model for the type of vertex considered excluded volume effects are not so pronounced as walks have considerable freedom to overlap .",
    "we performed a series of numerical calculations for a lattice version of the gmo model both in @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( cubic and square lattices ) .",
    "we considered two random walks of length @xmath11 , described by the vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) which identify the positions of the lattice monomers .",
    "the walks have common origin ( @xmath75 ) , and no specific boundary condition is imposed on the other ends . while each strand can overlap itself , mutual avoidance requires that @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "overlaps at homologous points are however allowed ( @xmath78 ) ; these correspond to a bound state of complementary base pairs , to which we assign an energy @xmath79 . at sufficiently low temperature ( @xmath80 )",
    "the walks are fully bound and form an object obeying self - avoiding walk statistics .",
    "we used the perm @xcite algorithm and computed @xmath81 the probability distribution function ( pdf ) to find a loop of length @xmath48 in the chain .",
    "while at low temperatures loops are exponentially distributed in size , at the critical point the pdf has an algebraic decay @xmath20 , from which we can extract the exponent @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig06 ] shows a log - log plot @xmath81 vs. @xmath23 in @xmath9 at the estimated critical point ( @xmath82 ) , for chains of lengths up to @xmath83 .",
    "a linear fit of the data yields @xmath84 , not far from the @xmath69 given by eq .",
    "( [ cinteracting ] ) ( see table [ table01 ] ) .",
    "the result confirms that the transition in the gmo model is sharper than when self - avoidance is fully included .",
    "indeed , in the latter case the most accurate numerical estimate of the loop exponent is @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "0.2truecm    we consider next @xmath86 , the probability that the distance between homologous points in the strands @xmath87 equals @xmath88 .",
    "this quantity was found to decay as a stretched exponential for @xmath89 @xcite , from an analysis of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamin ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is at odd with the algebraic decay of the loop pdf found here for the gmo model , and also in other similar models with a first order transition @xcite . for the numerical calculation of @xmath90 we registered all distances between homologous pairs along the chains @xmath87 , starting from @xmath91 and up to the highest @xmath92 for which the two strands are in contact ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "figure [ fig07 ] shows a plot of @xmath94 vs. @xmath95 at the transition temperature in @xmath96 .",
    "we can not fit the data with a stretched exponential decay , but by increasing the system size the data approach a power law decay @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the fact that @xmath99 implies that the probability is normalizable .",
    "this is a confirmation that the transition is of first order type ( see ref .",
    "notice however , that the algebraic nature of @xmath90 implies infinite moments @xmath100 starting from @xmath101 .",
    "we conclude that the exponential decay found in ref .",
    "@xcite is an artifact of the approximation introduced .",
    "we performed a series of calculations also in the two dimensional case . at the estimated critical temperature ( @xmath102 ) we find , from the decay of the probability distributions @xmath81 and @xmath90 , the estimates @xmath103 and @xmath104 , confirming the first order nature of the transition .",
    "again denaturation happens to be sharper than in the case where self - avoidance is fully incorporated , for which @xmath105 @xcite . in the perm algorithm",
    "both types of vertices of fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] are generated , thus @xmath1 can not be directly compared with any of the value obtained analytically in the previous section .    0.2truecm",
    "in this paper we studied the model for dna denaturation recently introduced by garel , monthus and orland @xcite .",
    "our analysis is complementary to that of ref . @xcite and it is based on the calculation of the exponent @xmath1 describing the algebraic decay of the probability of denaturated loop lengths at the critical point . using exact results from mutually avoiding",
    "walks statistics we find that @xmath0 already for isolated loops , implying that the transition is of first order type .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is not based on the approximate treatments @xcite .    for some specific simple geometries in which a loop is embedded in the chain we provide analytical estimates of @xmath1 , following ideas from the theory of polymer networks @xcite .",
    "these calculations show explicitly that @xmath1 increases with respect to the isolated loop value , i.e. the transition robustly maintains its first order character .",
    "more surprising is , at first sight , the fact that the denaturation in the gmo model is sharper than that occurring in models where excluded volume constraints are fully incorporated ( higher @xmath1 ) , as indicated by our analytical and numerical estimates of @xmath1 both in @xmath8 and @xmath41 .",
    "this behavior can be explained by taking into account that the self - avoidance of the single strands somehow contrasts the excluded volume effects between each loop and the rest of the molecule .",
    "the result is that , when the single strand self - avoidance is relaxed , the loop sizes are further reduced , consistently with an increase of @xmath1 .    it is somehow remarkable how results of the theory of block copolymer networks , which are relevant to issues like that of establishing a link between field theory and multifractal measures ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , allow to draw reliable predictions on models of the denaturation transition of dna .",
    "there is another possibility of relaxing the self - avoidance which is somehow complementary to that of the gmo model .",
    "one can indeed neglect the mutual avoidance between the strands , while keeping self - avoidance within each stand .",
    "this possibility was studied in @xmath9 in ref . @xcite and the denaturation transition turns out to be continuous ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , relaxing the self - avoidance constraint in two different ways within the single loop , results in a softening ( as in the latter example ) or a sharpening ( as in the gmo model ) of the transition .",
    "finally , we also considered the probability distribution of the distances between homologous monomers of the two strands .",
    "we found that this quantity decays as a power law at the transition point , in disagreement with the stretched exponential behavior found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is probably an artifact of the approximation introduced there .",
    "the algebraic decay of various quantities at denaturation , even in the case of first order transitions , is a common feature of other similar models . finding the appropriate treatment of the hamiltonian ( [ hamin ] ) , which provides power - laws decay at the transition point is still an open question .",
    "useful discussions with david mukamel are gratefully aknowledged .    0.2truecm",
    "we review here some known results for entropic exponents of networks of arbitrary topology .",
    "we focus mainly on networks whose constituent polymers are all of the same type , and just briefly mention copolymer networks .",
    "let us consider a network made of self - avoiding walks , all avoiding each other , as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08](a ) .",
    "let @xmath106 be the total length of the network , where each segment has length @xmath107 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath108 , @xmath109 , the total number of configurations for the network scales as @xcite : @xmath110 where the factor @xmath18 is the effective connectivity constant for the walks ( see e.g. ref @xcite ) and @xmath111 is a scaling function .",
    "the universal exponent @xmath112 depends only on the number of independent loops , @xmath113 , and the number of vertices with @xmath92 outgoing segments @xmath114 as @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 are exponents associated to a vertex with @xmath92 outgoing legs .",
    "such exponents are known exactly in @xmath8 from conformal invariance @xcite , while they have been obtained from renormalization group and resummation techniques in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we notice that it is also customary to use the definition @xmath117 .",
    "this theory was recently applied to the denaturation problem @xcite . in this case one",
    "considers network geometries as that of fig .",
    "[ fig08](b ) , in which a loop of total length @xmath48 is connected to two polymers of lengths @xmath118 each . following the above notation one has @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 and thus the total number of configurations scale as : @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "now in the limit @xmath124 one should recover the partition function for a self - avoiding walk of total length @xmath11 which has an entropic exponent @xmath125 .",
    "this requires that : @xmath126 in the limit @xmath127 .",
    "thus , loops of length @xmath23 embedded within a long chain of length @xmath11 ( @xmath128 ) are distributed according to the probability @xmath129 , with @xcite : @xmath130    as second example we consider a loop of length @xmath48 embedded between two long loops of total length @xmath131 , as depicted in fig . [ fig08](b ) . the total number of configurations is still given by eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) with @xmath132 , as the network has now @xmath133 independent loops and two vertices with four outgoing legs , i.e. @xmath134 . in the limit @xmath124",
    "one should find the partition function of two loops joined at a single vertex .",
    "matching the scaling function in this limit yields @xmath135 for @xmath127 .",
    "one finds thus that loops are distributed according to the probability @xmath20 , with @xcite : @xmath136    finally , this theory can be generalized to the case of networks with more than one type of polymer , as for _ copolymer _ networks .",
    "( [ gammag ] ) can be generalized easily in the case that the constituting polymers have all the same metric exponents ( for instance in the case of mutually avoiding random walks ) .",
    "the only difference is that now vertex exponents will not depend only on the number of outgoing legs , but also on the type of polymers forming the vertex and , in two dimensions , also on the order .",
    "for instance , for a network made of two types of polymers , which are random walks and mutually avoiding with a geometry of fig .",
