    "optical wide - field surveys with a high cadence has recently emerged as a potential powerful tool to search for optical transient phenomena , and hence to advance our understanding of astrophysics of compact and high - energy objects .",
    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) survey with the palomar 1.2-m schmidt telescope and the kiso supernova survey ( kiss ) with the kiso wide field camera ( kwfc ) on the kiso 1.0-m schmidt telescope have discovered new species of transients with timescales of hours to days from supernovae , novae , to active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "high - cadence and wide - field monitoring surveys with the hyper suprime - cam on the subaru 8.2-m telescope and the kepler space telescope have successfully obtained transient light - curves originating in shock breakouts of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate importance of high - cadence wide - field survey observations to find rare and short - duration transients . unsurprisingly",
    ", some next - generation survey projects , such as 8.2-m large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and zwicky transient facility ( ztf ) on the palomar schmidt telescope , will be also high - cadence and cover wide fields for galactic , extra - galactic , and solar - system objects @xcite .",
    "the tomo - e gozen is a wide - field cmos camera on the kiso 1.0-m schmidt telescope under development at the time of writing , and is expected to be completed in 2018 @xcite .",
    "it is optimized for movie observations with sub - second to seconds time - resolutions , and once completed , will be capable of taking consecutive frames with a field - of - view of 20 deg@xmath1 at 2 frames per second ( fps ) by 84 chips of 2k @xmath2 1k cmos sensors .",
    "the primary objective of observations with the tomo - e gozen is to catch rare and fast transient phenomena with a time duration shorter than 10 seconds , such as optical counterparts of fast radio bursts @xcite , giant pulses in millisecond pulsars @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and binary neutron - star mergers @xcite .",
    "the wide - field movie observation with the tomo - e gozen is also ideal for exploring fast moving objects , including near - earth objects and space debris .",
    "such phenomena can not be explored by the projects using ccds like ptf , ztf and lsst , whose time resolutions are 60 , 30 and 15 seconds , respectively .    a prototype model of the tomo - e gozen with 8 cmos chips on the kiso schmidt telescope",
    "( hereafter , the tomo - e pm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been developed , which has achieved the frame rate of 2-fps so far .",
    "we have obtained movie data with a format of fits cube for each cmos sensor . a data file",
    "typically consists of 400 frames of the same field images with @xmath3 pixels .",
    "the data rate of the tomo - e pm is @xmath080 mb s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath03 tb per night .",
    "then , an observation with the complete model of the tomo - e gozen will produce a huge amount of data of @xmath030 tb per night .",
    "it is therefore practically indispensable to compress the data .",
    "the data - compression methods have two types : lossless and lossy compressions . since random noise pervades all the pixels in our case ,",
    "the former is not effective .",
    "for example , the popular lossless tool gzip reduced our movie data by only @xmath018% .",
    "some lossless methods were proposed for astronomical data sets @xcite . in this paper , we discuss the latter , lossy compression .",
    "various lossy compression algorithms have been proposed for application to astronomical data , such as jpeg2000 @xcite , the method using singular value decomposition ( svd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wavelet @xcite . none of them , however , are so far optimized for astronomical `` movie '' data .",
    "commercial compression tools for movie data like mpeg4 are readily available .",
    "however , we think that at least mpeg method is not appropriate for our data",
    ". this method divides images into box regions , and for each box region it compresses the data based on the discrete cosine transform .",
    "the level of compression is not uniform , then the fluctuation of pixel intensities becomes different in a source and a background region used for aperture photometry .",
    "it results in uncertainty for the photometric intensity of point sources .    here",
    ", we propose an efficient method to compress the movie data for both the space and time domains simultaneously in the lossy - compression manner but without losing signals of transient phenomena , with a calculation speed comparable or faster than the production rate to avoid accumulating yet - unprocessed data .",
    "in order to compress the movie data obtained by the tomo - e gozen , we choose to use low - rank matrix approximation to reduce the data size without losing transient events . before applying it",
    ", we re - arrange the pixel values contained in a movie data set ( @xmath5 frames of images with @xmath6 pixels ) into a matrix with @xmath6 rows and @xmath5 columns ( figure  [ fig : matrix_decomp_merge ] ) . here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the concept of low - rank matrix approximation with sparse matrix decomposition was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite improved the algorithm and the computational speed , and developed godec .",
    "since the computational speed is critical in the tomo - e gozen application , we develop our method based on godec . in our case",
    ", an original data matrix @xmath12 is decomposed into @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are a low - rank , sparse , and noise matrix , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : matrix_decomp_merge ] ) , so that the following function is minimized , @xmath17 subject to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the frobenius norm of a matrix .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 control the rank and cardinarity of the low - rank and sparse matrices , respectively .    for the low - rank matrix @xmath14",
    ", we check the distribution of singular values , applying singular value decomposition ( svd ) , as shown in the main panel of figure  [ fig : sigval ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath14 is expressed as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are orthogonal matrices , and @xmath26 is a diagonal one .",
    "then , we set the rank of the low - rank matrix by setting zeros for the singular values at indices larger than the rank . within the sparse matrix @xmath15 , the transient events can be easily extracted , because these events are innately sparse .",
    "the time variation of the sky background can be monitored by checking the noise matrix @xmath16 .",
    "after the data matrix @xmath12 is decomposed into three matrices , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , further data processing is necessary , because otherwise the data size would remain three times larger than that of the original data .",
    "the low - rank matrix @xmath14 is easily compressed to three small matrices , as shown in figure  [ fig : matrix_decomp_merge ] . for the sparse matrix @xmath15 , the frames that contain a transient event(s )",
    "must be preserved , and the others should be discarded . for this reduction ,",
    "we use machine - learning methods to select point sources , which has been already established ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for the noise matrix @xmath16",
    ", we obtain some statistics to summarize the distribution of the pixel values and remove the matrix .",
    "then , the number of pixels can be reduced from the original number of @xmath27 to @xmath28 where @xmath21 is a rank of the low - rank matrix @xmath14 , and @xmath29 is the number of frames of the sparse matrix @xmath15 , which contains transient events .",
    "typically , @xmath21 is about @xmath30 and @xmath29 is smaller than 10 .",
    "therefore , the reduction factor of the data is @xmath31 .",
    "the original code of godec was implemented with matlab .",
    "however , we find the original code to be impractical to apply to our movie data due to the speed of computation and memory consumption . we have rewritten the godec code with c++ , utilizing openblas and lapack libraries .",
    "we use quick select , instead of full sorting , to select non - zero elements for a sparse matrix in the godec algorithm .     made by the decomposition .",
    "the central panel shows the distribution of singular values of the matrix as a function of the index of the diagonal matrix @xmath26 , obtained by svd .",
    "the five images in the left - hand side show stable point sources , where each image is the decomposed component in the matrix @xmath24 corresponding to the top five singular values .",
    "the upper panel shows the time variation of intensity of these components in the matrix @xmath25 in gray scale .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "we used a movie dataset of a cmos sensor for 400 frames obtained with the tomo - e pm in 2015 december , which contains some transient events lasting for a short duration @xcite .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( e ) of figure  [ fig : ols_img ] show sub - array images with 300 @xmath2 300 pixels  in two different time - frames , which contained a transient point source and a meteor , respectively .",
    "we applied the decomposition to the data by setting @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "panels ( b , c , d ) and ( f , g , h ) of figure  [ fig : ols_img ] show the result . a transient was extracted in the sparse matrix @xmath15 ( panel c ) and a line generated by a meteor was also detected ( panel g ) .",
    "in contrast , the low - rank image @xmath14 ( panels b , f ) did not contain any transients .",
    "these results confirm that the decomposition was successful .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigval ] shows the singular values obtained by svd of the low - rank matrix @xmath14 , suggesting that the rank of 10 is sufficient to preserve the information of stable point sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise ] shows the pixel values of the noise images @xmath16 .",
    "the histograms have a symmetrical shape , no bias and no anomaly structure . in figure",
    "[ fig : noise_g_m ] , pixel intensities of noise images @xmath16 were plotted against those of original images @xmath12 , which shows that the intensities of @xmath16 are independent of the original intensities .",
    "we found that the photometric intensity of point sources in the low - rank matrix @xmath14 is reduced from the original value , as shown in figure  [ fig : intensity_ratio ] .",
    "however , it is possible to recover the original intensity as follows .",
    "the photometric intensity of a point source is measured by the standard aperture photometry . to model the distribution of the pixel intensity of a point source , namely point spread function ( psf ) , we assume a two - dimensional gaussian function with symmetrical widths for simplicity",
    ". that is , the pixel value at a distance @xmath21 from the center of the point source is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the fwhm and the total intensity of a point source , respectively .",
    "then , the total intensity of the pixels within an aperture radius @xmath37 is @xmath38.\\ ] ] for the residual from the low rank approximation , the pixels lower than a threshold ( @xmath39 ) are separated into the sparse matrix @xmath15 or the noise matrix @xmath16 .",
    "this applies for the psf , which results in reducing the aperture size of a point source to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath39 corresponds to the lower threshold of pixel value selected for the sparse matrix @xmath15 .",
    "then , the fraction of the photometric intensity in the low - rank matrix @xmath14 ( @xmath42 ) to the original one @xmath12 ( @xmath43 ) is approximated by @xmath44 figure  [ fig : intensity_ratio ] shows the model curve of @xmath45 for @xmath46 , obtained from the sparse matrix ( figure  [ fig : sparse ] ) , and it is in good agreement with the actual data .",
    "this implies that the original intensities are recovered well from the low - rank matrix .",
    "next , we examined the sparse matrix , using the transient point source that appeared in the frame of the upper row of figure  [ fig : ols_img ] .",
    "we extracted the source from the original @xmath12 ( panel a ) and sparse @xmath15 ( panel c ) matrices , and found that the intensity of the latter was 74% of the former .",
    "this would not be a problem , because we can simply preserve the original image data in any time - frame that is found to contain a transient source(s ) .",
    "finally , the processing time of the decomposition was 320 s for the movie data with @xmath3 pixels and @xmath11 frames , by setting 10 for the rank of a low - rank matrix , for which we used a budget computer , equipped with a cpu of intel xeon processor e5 - 1630 ( 3.70 ghz ) consisting of eight cores .",
    "the processing time is 1.6 times longer than the duration of observation of 200 s ( @xmath47 s @xmath2 @xmath11 frames ) , which is sufficiently fast for daily observations , as long as one cpu is used for each sensor .",
    "we have proposed to use the low - rank matrix approximation with sparse matrix decomposition in order to compress the movie astronomical data without losing transient events . compared with the conventional low - rank matrix approximation with principal component analysis and svd",
    ", our method has an advantage of preserving the transients in the sparse matrices , which is essential for the transient - search project with the tomo - e gozen .",
    "although the value of @xmath22 was chosen by hand in the current study , it should be chosen so as to maximize the number of the transients which would be selected by the following machine - learning method .",
    "if the optimal @xmath22 is small , further data compression is possible for the sparse matrix @xmath15 by storing @xmath48 numbers for the indices and values of non - zero elements of @xmath15 . in the machine - learning step for the transient detection , either of @xmath15 and @xmath49 can be used .",
    "the latter data may be better , but we have not yet confirmed .",
    "we will present these studies in the future .",
    "our method may miss transient sources which have low significance in each frame but are high significance by stacking multiple frames , if they have time durations of more than a few seconds . in our policy",
    ", we discard this type of sources , because the primary objective of the tomo - e gozen project is discovering transient sources with a short time scale .",
    "in addition , it is possible to keep these transients by stacking raw frames in various time durations like 5 , 10 , 50 seconds and so on , before applying our compression method .",
    "now , we are developing both the hardware and software systems of the tomo - e gozen survey , including the cmos camera , data analysis pipeline , and scheduling .",
    "our proposed method has successfully overcome one of the challenges that the project faces .",
    "the tomo - e gozen will pioneer a new field of astronomy , `` movie astronomy . ''",
    "this research is supported by crest and presto , japan science and technology agency ( jst ) , and in part , by jsps grants - in - aid for scientific research ( kakenhi ) grant number jp25120008 , jp25103502 , jp26247074 , jp24103001 , jp16h02158 and jp16h06341 .",
