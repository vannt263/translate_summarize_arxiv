    "while large cp violating asymmetry has recently been confirmed in b - meson decay  @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) does not predict any appreciable cp violation ( cpv ) in the lepton sector .",
    "however , physics beyond the sm could produce cpv in leptonic processes ; we would expect such effects to be enhanced for @xmath1 leptons due to their large mass .",
    "parameterizing cpv in @xmath1-pair production by an electric dipole moment @xmath0 , several authors have found possible effects of order @xmath9 cm due to new physics models  @xcite .",
    "the best existing bounds on @xmath0 are indirect , requiring @xmath10 cm based on naturalness arguments  @xcite and precision lep data  @xcite.cm has also been derived from the experimental limits on @xmath11 decay  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that this result assumes a particular ansatz for the lepton mixing matrix . in a recent preprint  @xcite",
    ", other authors have argued that the same constraint may be derived under weaker assumptions . ]",
    "previous direct measurements have been performed at lep , where l3  @xcite found @xmath12 cm and opal  @xcite found @xmath13 cm , using the process @xmath14 ; and by argus  @xcite , which set limits @xmath15 cm and @xmath16 cm based on a study of @xmath17 production .    in this paper",
    "we present the first direct measurement of the @xmath1 lepton s electric dipole moment with a sensitivity in the @xmath18 cm range .",
    "we improve on the sensitivity of argus by an order of magnitude , by reducing the systematic uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath0 , and by analyzing a much larger sample of events .",
    "we adapt the so - called optimal observable method  @xcite , which maximizes the sensitivity to @xmath0 . here",
    "the optimal observables are defined as @xmath41 the mean value of the observable @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where the integration is over the phase space ( @xmath44 ) spanned by the relevant kinematic variables .",
    "the cross - term containing the integral of the product of @xmath45 and @xmath46 drops out because of their different symmetry properties .",
    "the expression for the imaginary part is similar .",
    "the means of the observables @xmath47 and @xmath48 are therefore linear functions of @xmath49 , @xmath50    eight different final states in the decay of @xmath1-pairs , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , are analyzed , where all particles except @xmath59 and @xmath60 are positively or negatively charged .",
    "because of the undetectable particles , we can not fully reconstruct the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , for each event we calculate possible kinematic configurations and obtain the mean value of @xmath61 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 by averaging over the calculated configurations . in the case when both @xmath1 leptons decay hadronically ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) , the @xmath1 flight direction is calculated with a two - fold ambiguity  @xcite and we take the average of @xmath61 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 over the two solutions . in the case",
    "when either one or both @xmath1 leptons decay leptonically ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) , a monte carlo ( mc ) treatment is adopted to take into account the additional ambiguity in the effective mass of the @xmath66 system ( @xmath67 ) . for each event we generate 100 mc configurations using a hit - and - miss approach by varying @xmath67 , and compute the averaged @xmath61 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 over successful tries in which the @xmath1 direction can be constructed kinematically . in the calculation",
    ", we ignore the effect of undetected photons coming from initial state radiation , radiative @xmath1 decays and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the resulting bias in @xmath0 is included among the systematic errors ; the effect on the final result is negligible .",
    "in this analysis , we use 26.8 million @xmath1-pairs ( @xmath68 ) accumulated with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb accelerator  @xcite .",
    "kekb is an asymmetric energy @xmath69 collider with a beam crossing angle of 22 mrad .",
    "its center - of - mass energy is 10.58 gev , corresponding to the @xmath70 resonance , with beam energies of 8 and 3.5 gev for electrons and positrons , respectively .",
    "belle is a general - purpose detector with an asymmetric structure along the beam direction . among the detector elements , the central drift chamber ( cdc ) and the silicon vertex detector ( svd ) are essential to obtain the momentum vectors of charged particles . the combined information from the silica aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) , the time - of - flight counters ( tof ) , the csi electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) , and the @xmath71 detector ( klm ) is used for particle identification .",
    "the mc event generators koralb / tauola  @xcite are used for @xmath1-pair production and decays .",
    "the detector simulation is performed with a geant - based program , gsim .",
    "actual data and mc generated events are reconstructed by the same program written by the belle collaboration .",
    ".yield , purity and background rate obtained for the event selection described in the text , where the purity is evaluated by mc simulation and its error comes from mc statistics . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we obtain mean values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 over the eight different @xmath74 modes weighted by quadratically summed statistical and systematic errors , @xmath75 with corresponding 95% confidence limits @xmath76        we would like to thank professors k.  hagiwara , o.  nachtmann , and z.  was for their constructive advice and many helpful discussions .",
