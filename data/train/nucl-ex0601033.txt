    "the study of identified hadron spectra at large transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions can be used to test the predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite . in the framework of models based on qcd",
    ", the inclusive production of single hadrons is described by the convolution of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , parton interaction cross - sections and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) .",
    "the pdf provide the probability of finding a parton ( a quark or a gluon ) in a hadron as a function of the fraction of the hadron s momentum carried by the parton .",
    "the ffs  @xcite give the probability for a hard scattered parton to fragment into a hadron of a given momentum fraction .",
    "these are not yet calculable from the first principles and hence are generally obtained from experimental data ( e.g. , @xmath10+@xmath11 collisions ) .",
    "the factorization theorem for cross - sections assumes that ffs are independent of the process in which they have been determined and hence represent a universal property of hadronization .",
    "it is therefore possible to make quantitative predictions for other types of collision systems ( e.g. , @xmath1+@xmath1 ) .",
    "comparisons between experimental data and theory can help to constrain the quark and gluon ffs that are critical to predictions of hadron spectra in @xmath1+@xmath1 , @xmath1+a , and a+a collisions .",
    "the simultaneous study of identified hadron @xmath0 spectra in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions may also provide important information on the pdfs  @xcite of the nucleus .    the identified particle spectra in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions also provide reference spectra for particle production at high @xmath0 in au+au collisions .",
    "moreover , studies of identified particle production and their ratios as a function of @xmath0 in high - energy heavy - ion collisions have revealed many unique features in different @xmath0 regions  @xcite and between baryons and mesons  @xcite .",
    "a good description of both identified pion and proton spectra in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions at intermediate and high @xmath0 by nlo pqcd will provide a solid ground for models based on jet quenching  @xcite and quark recombination  @xcite .",
    "these emphasize the need for a systematic study of @xmath0 spectra from @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions at the same energy as the nucleus - nucleus collisions .    in this letter",
    ", we present the @xmath0 spectra for identified pions , protons and anti - protons in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions at @xmath3 = 200 gev as measured by the star experiment at rhic .",
    "the results are compared to nlo pqcd calculations and a phenomenological model .",
    "we also study the @xmath8-scaling in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions and the nuclear modification factors in @xmath2+au collisions .",
    "the star experiment consists of several detectors to measure hadronic and electromagnetic observables spanning a large region of the available phase space at rhic .",
    "the detectors used in the present analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector , a set of trigger detectors used for obtaining the minimum bias data , and the forward time projection chamber for the collision centrality determination in @xmath2+au collisions .",

    "since pions are the dominant component of the hadrons in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions at rhic , the prominent pion peak in the @xmath16 distribution is fit with a gaussian to extract the pion yield  @xcite .",
    "the proton yield is obtained by integrating the entries ( @xmath22 ) in the low part of the @xmath16 distribution about @xmath23 away from the pion @xmath16 peak .",

    "the tracking efficiencies are @xmath31 88% and 92% in @xmath1+@xmath1 and @xmath2+au collisions , respectively .",
    "the difference in tracking efficiency arises because of worse vertex determination in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions than @xmath2+au collisions .",

    "the spectra are not corrected for momentum resolution effects , but they are included in the systematic errors .    the total systematic uncertainties associated with pion yields are estimated to be @xmath34 15% .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in modeling the detector response in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "protons from hyperon ( @xmath32 and @xmath35 ) decays away from the primary vertex can be reconstructed as primordial protons at a slightly higher @xmath0 than their true value , but with worse momentum resolution .",
