    "the existence of gluonic mesons belongs to the early predictions of qcd and first scenarios have been developed back in 1975@xcite . today , quantitative results are available from + 1 .",
    "lattice qcd : in full qcd both glue and @xmath8 states couple to the flavour singlet @xmath9 states and first `` unquenched '' results for the lightest gluonic state point towards a mass of around 1 gev@xcite .",
    "this is a considerably lower mass value than what is obtained in the pure yang mills theory for gluons ( quenched approximation ) where the lightest glueball is found at masses around 1700 mev ( recent review@xcite ) .",
    "further studies concerning the dependence on lattice spacing and the quark mass appear important .",
    "qcd sum rules : results on the scalar glueball and various decays are obtained in@xcite .",
    "the lightest gluonic state is found in the mass range ( 750 - 1000 ) mev with a decay width of ( 300 - 1000 ) mev into @xmath10 and the width into @xmath11 of ( 0.2 - 0.3 ) kev .",
    "other analyses find similar or slightly higher masses @xmath12 mev for the lightest glueball@xcite .",
    "in the search for glueballs one attempts to group the scalar mesons into flavour multiplets ( either @xmath8 or tetraquarks ) and to identify supernumerous states .",
    "the existence of such states could be a hint for glueballs either pure or mixed with @xmath8 isoscalars .",
    "in other experimental activities one looks for states which are enhanced in `` gluon rich '' processes and are suppressed in @xmath11 processes .",
    "the lightest isoscalar states listed in the particle data group@xcite are @xmath13 where the question mark behind @xmath5 will be explained below .",
    "there are different routes to group these states into multiplets together with @xmath14 and @xmath15 states .    in a popular approach the two lightest isoscalars in ( [ scalars ] )",
    "are combined with @xmath16 and @xmath17 to form the lightest nonet , either of @xmath8 or of @xmath18 type .",
    "then the next higher multiplet from @xmath8 would include @xmath19 ; near these masses three isoscalars are found in the list ( [ scalars ] ) at 1370 , 1500 and 1710 mev and this suggests to consider these three mesons as mixtures of the two members of the @xmath8 nonet and one glueball ( for an early reference , see@xcite ) .",
    "a potential problem in this scheme for the glueball is the very existence of @xmath5 , otherwise there is no supernumerous state in this mass range .",
    "some problems with this state will be discussed below , see also the review@xcite .",
    "the low mass multiplet depends on the existence of @xmath20 which we consider as not beyond any doubt : its observed phase motion is rather weak and it is markedly different from the one of @xmath21 , see below .",
    "there are other approaches for the classification of the scalar mesons where @xmath22 is the lightest @xmath8 scalar . in the scheme we prefer@xcite",
    "the lightest @xmath8 nonet contains @xmath23 together with @xmath19 .",
    "the supernumerous state @xmath3 , called previously @xmath24 , corresponds to a very broad object which extends from @xmath10 threshold up to about 2 gev and is interpreted as largely gluonic .",
    "no separate @xmath5 is introduced , nor @xmath16 .",
    "our classification is consistent with various findings on production and decay processes including @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays@xcite .",
    "related schemes are the bonn model@xcite with a similar mixing scheme for the isoscalars and the k - matrix model@xcite which finds a similar classification ( but with @xmath5 included ) and a broad glueball , centered at the higher masses around 1500 mev .",
    "we are interested here in particular in the problem of @xmath5 and also in the behaviour of the broad `` background '' which is related to @xmath3 or `` @xmath4 '' , alias @xmath24 and describe the results from an ongoing analysis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "information on @xmath10 scattering can be obtained from production experiments like @xmath28 by isolating the contribution of the one - pion - exchange process . in an unpolarised target experiment these amplitudes",
    "can be extracted by using dynamical assumptions , such as `` spin and phase coherence '' , which have been tested by experiments with polarised target . at the level of the process @xmath29 in",
    "different charge states one measures the distribution in scattering angle , @xmath30 , or their moments @xmath31 , in a sequence of mass intervals .",
    "the @xmath10 partial wave amplitudes @xmath32 can be obtained in each bin from the measured moments up to the overall phase and a discrete ambiguity ( characterised by the `` barrelet zeros '' ) .",
    "the overall phase can be fixed by fitting a breit wigner amplitude for the leading resonances @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the experimental moments @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively",
    ".    phase shift analyses of this type for @xmath38 scattering have been performed by the cern - munich group : an analysis guided by a global resonance fit ( cm - i @xcite ) and a fully energy - independent analysis by cm - ii@xcite and by estabrooks and martin@xcite ; the latter two analyses found 4 different solutions above 1 gev in mass .",
    "up to 1400 mev a unique solution has been found@xcite using results from polarised target and unitarity .",
    "two solutions remain above 1400 mev , classified according to barrelet zeros in@xcite as ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) . corresponding to sols . a , c in@xcite",
    ".    a new result has been added recently@xcite by the construction of the isoscalar s wave @xmath41 from the @xmath42 data ( gams collaboration@xcite ) and the @xmath43 scattering data .",
    "this @xmath41 wave shows a qualitatively similar behaviour to @xmath41 obtained from @xmath44 scattering above , namely a resonance circle in the complex plane ( argand diagram ) related to @xmath45 above a slowly moving circular background amplitude .",
    "this has lead us to select the solution ( @xmath40 ) as unique solution .",
    "we relate the differences in the two results to systematic errors introduced through the overall phase and the @xmath46 wave , but these are only slowly varying effects as function of mass .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      the resulting amplitude @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] using the cm - ii data after correction for the more recent @xmath43 amplitudes .",
    "the curves refer to a fit of the data ( cm - ii for @xmath48 gev , cm - i for @xmath49 gev ) to an s - matrix in the space of 3 reaction channels ( @xmath50 ) as product of individual s - matrices for resonances @xmath51 @xmath52^{-1 }     \\nonumber\\\\     & &    \\phantom{xxx}\\times\\rho^{\\frac{1}{2}t } ( g_ig_j)\\rho^\\frac{1}{2 }      \\label{smatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] the fit including 3 resonances gives a reasonable description of the data .",
    "for @xmath45 the fit parameters @xmath54 are obtained in remarkable agreement to the pdg numbers , despite the different approaches involved .",
    "the broad object is also described by a resonance form with mass parameter @xmath56 mev and width @xmath57 mev .",
    "the elastic width is about 85% whereas the gams data suggest rather a smaller value around 70% .",
    "more details will be given elsewhere .",
    "this parametrisation is also shown at the lower rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] .",
    "it describes about 3/4 of the full resonance circle .",
    "the breit wigner mass parameter @xmath58 denotes the mass where the amplitude is purely imaginary .",
    "it is different from the pole mass which is referred to as resonance mass .",
    "this mass value appears to be considerably lower and requires a more careful study of the line shape in the denominator of ( [ smatrix ] ) .    in any case , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] suggest there is evidence for a broad state in @xmath10 , centered around 1000 mev along the physical region and what is called @xmath3 or @xmath4 refers to the same state , there can not be two states .",
    "we also note here that the @xmath10 scattering looks considerably different from elastic @xmath59 scattering in that the phase of the `` background '' found in the analysis of the lass data@xcite moves more slowly staying below 90@xmath60 always .",
    "the existence of @xmath20 would become evident if the phase passed through @xmath61 in forming a circle as in case of @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] do not give any indication of the existence of @xmath5 which would show up as a second circle in the argand diagram with respective signals in @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , none of the energy - independent bin by bin analyses of the cm or ckm data@xcite nor of the gams data@xcite gave such an indication . from our analysis",
    "we exclude an additional state with branching ratio @xmath64 near 1370 mev ( this would correspond to a circle of diameter 0.1 ) .",
    "these results from the bin - by - bin analysis are in apparent conflict with two other analyses presented at this conference@xcite . in both studies",
    "cm - i moments as well as various other data sets from 3 body final states , have been fitted by model amplitudes with resonances in all relevant partial waves .",
    "the amplitude @xmath41 by bugg@xcite shows @xmath5 as an extra circle of diameter 0.25 whereas sarantsev s argand diagram@xcite shows no extra circle but an effect in the phase movement .",
    "obviously , these discrepancies need to be understood .",
    "the following arguments are in favour of this state to be a glueball@xcite .",
    "this state is produced in almost all `` gluon rich '' processes , including central production @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and finally @xmath71 related to @xmath72 .",
    "the high mass tail above 1 gev is seen as `` background '' in @xmath73 and in @xmath74 decay channels where it leads to striking interference phenomena with @xmath45@xcite .",
    "+ 2 . within our classification scheme@xcite without @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath5 the state @xmath3 is supernumerous .",
    "the mass and large width is in agreement with the qcd sum rule results and also with the first results from unquenched lattice qcd .",
    "suppression in @xmath11 production .",
    "+ recently , the radiative width @xmath75 kev has been determined by pennington@xcite from the process @xmath76 . as",
    "this number is larger than expected for glueballs ( see sect.1 ) , he concluded this state `` unlikely to be gluonic '' .",
    "similar results on this width are obtained by@xcite .",
    "a resolution of this conflict has been suggested in a recent paper@xcite .",
    "it is argued that the phenomenology of @xmath76 at low energies is different from the one at high energies . at low energies ,",
    "few 100 mev above threshold , the photons couple to the charged pions and the born term with one pion exchange dominates in @xmath77 , in addition there is a contribution from @xmath38 rescattering .",
    "explicit models with @xmath10 scattering as input and with @xmath3 pole , can explain the low energy processes@xcite , also calculations in @xmath78 with non - resonant @xmath10 scattering at low energies @xcite . in this case of the rescattering contribution ,",
    "a resonance decaying into @xmath10 would also decay into @xmath11 irrespective of the constituent nature of the state .    at high energies , the photons",
    "do resolve the constituents of the produced resonances : for example , the radiative widths of tensor mesons @xmath79 in the region 1200 - 1500 mev follow the expectations from a @xmath8 state .    in the model by mennessier@xcite the low energy rescattering and the high energy `` direct '' component relating to the constituents",
    "are added ; the unitarization keeps the validity of watson s theorem .",
    "a fit of the data at the lower energies @xmath80 mev provides an estimate of the direct contribution from its deviation from the rescattering term .",
    "this yields @xmath81 kev ( @xmath82 ) , alternatively , one can express this result as upper limit @xmath83 kev ( 90%cl ) .",
    "this result implies that there is no contradiction with a gluonic interpretation of @xmath3 .    finally , we express some expectations for experiment which follow from this interpretation .",
    "+ 1 . because of its large width the state @xmath3 overlaps with both physical regions . whereas the low energy region is governed by hadronic rescattering",
    "there is the transition to high energies with a resolution of the constituents .",
    "therefore we expect that for increasing mass @xmath84 gev the decay fraction @xmath85 decreases strongly relative to @xmath86 in consequence of the weak intrinsic coupling of the glueball to @xmath11 by an order of magnitude .",
    "+ 2 . in processes with virtual photons",
    "the @xmath10 rescattering contribution should be suppressed with respect to the direct @xmath8 coupling contribution because of the pion formfactor .",
    "this could result in a relative suppression of @xmath3 production at low @xmath10 mass with respect to @xmath22 if the latter state is dominantly @xmath8 ; this should hold for both space like ( @xmath87 ) and time like photons ( @xmath88 ) .    in this way",
    "the study of the @xmath89 wave cross section in two - photon processes ( or its upper limit obtained using the positivity of the density matrix@xcite ) could provide new clues on the interpretation of the broad state @xmath3 .",
