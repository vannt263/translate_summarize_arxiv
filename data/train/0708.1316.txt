    "* ) are transient low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that show x - ray pulsations during their outbursts .",
    "a total of nine amps out of  100 non - pulsating lmxbs have been found to date .",
    "the reason why only this small subgroup of binaries pulsates is still unknown .",
    "the first seven amps discovered showed persistent x - ray pulsations throughout the outbursts .",
    "recently @xcite discovered the amp hete  j1900.12455 , which has remained active for more than 2 years but showed pulsations only intermittently during the first @xmath2 months of activity @xcite . from the transient source aql x-1 pulsations",
    "were detected @xcite only for @xmath3  sec out of the @xmath4  msec the source has ( so far ) been observed with the rossi x - ray time explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "@xcite recently reported on the detection of @xmath5  hz pulsations in an observation of the 2005 outburst of a transient source in the globular cluster ( gc ) ngc  6440 .",
    "the pulsations followed a flux decay observed at the beginning of the observation and were reminiscent of those observed during superbursts ; however , as @xcite suggest , they could also be a detection from a new intermittent accreting millisecond pulsar .",
    "@xcite report a 409.7  hz burst oscillation in an x - ray transient ( sax  j1748.92021 ) located also in ngc  6440 and this gc harbors at least 24 x - ray sources @xcite , so @xcite concluded that the burst oscillations and the pulsations were probably coming from different x - ray transients in the same gc .",
    "the exact formation mechanisms behind the pulsations of these three sources remains unknown .",
    "the existence of intermittent pulsations with a small duty cycle implies that many other apparently non - pulsating lmxbs might be pulsating , bridging the gap between the small number of amps and the large group of non - pulsating lmxbs .",
    "we are performing a detailed analysis of all rxte archival data of neutron - star lmxbs to search for transient pulsations in their x - ray flux ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter we present the results of our search on the three x - ray outbursts observed from the globular cluster ngc  6440 .",
    "ngc  6440 is a gc at @xmath6  kpc @xcite .",
    "bright x - ray outbursts from a lmxb were reported in 1971 , 1998 , 2001 and 2005 @xcite .",
    "@xcite from x - ray and optical observations concluded that the 1998 and 2001 outbursts were from the same object , which they designated sax  j1748.92021 .",
    "we used data from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca , for instrument information see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "up to july , 2007 , there were 27 pointed observations of sax j1748.92021 , each covering 1 to 5 consecutive 90-min satellite orbits .",
    "usually , an orbit contains between 1 and 5 ksec of useful data separated by 14 ksec data gaps due to earth occultations and south atlantic anomaly passages . adopting a source position ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; j2000 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we converted the 260  kev photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter with the ftool faxbary , which uses the jpl de-200 ephemeris along with the spacecraft ephemeris and fine clock corrections to provide an absolute timing accuracy of  5 - 8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we performed a fourier timing analysis using the high - time resolution data collected in the event ( e_125us_64m_0_1s ) and the good xenon modes .",
    "power spectra were constructed using data segments of 128 , 256 and 512 seconds and with a nyquist frequency of 4096  hz .",
    "no background or dead - time corrections were made prior to the calculation of the power spectra , but all reported rms amplitudes are background corrected ; deadtime corrections are negligible .    .timing parameters for ngc  6440 [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : data ]      from the standard  2 data @xcite , we calculated colors and intensities with a time resolution of 16 seconds and normalized by crab ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the pca observations sample three different outbursts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the color - color diagrams show a pattern ( not plotted ) typical for atoll sources .",
    "the power spectral fits confirm the identification of these states ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we looked for khz qpos , but found none .",
    "no thermonuclear bursts were detected in the first outburst , sixteen during the second @xcite and four during the third one .",
    "we searched for burst oscillations during all bursts in the 154000  hz frequency range but found none .",
    "@xcite reported a @xmath10 burst oscillation at @xmath11  hz .",
    "we find these authors underestimated the number of trials by a factor of at least 180 , as their estimate did not take into account the number of x - ray bursts analyzed and the fact that a sliding window was used to find the maximum power .",
    "moreover , we also found that the distribution of powers is not exponential as these authors assumed .",
    "taking into account these effects we estimate the significance for their detection to be @xmath12 .",
    "we inspected each power spectrum for significant features .",
    "we found several , at frequencies @xmath5  hz in 7 observations : 60035 - 02 - 02 - 04/05/06 , 60035 - 02 - 03 - 00/02/03 during the second outburst and 91050 - 03 - 07 - 00 during the third outburst ( see also * ? ? ? * for a detailed analysis of this observation ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that the 1998 and 2001 outbursts from the lmxb in ngc  6440 were from the same source ( section 2 ) .",
    "since pulsations are detected in both the 2001 and 2005 outbursts , we can now conclude that these two outbursts are also from the same source .",
    "hence , all outbursts observed from ngc  6440 over the last decade are from sax j1748.92021 .",
    "the pulsations are detected intermittently , appearing and disappearing on time scales of hundreds of seconds .",
    "the appearance of pulsations seems to be related to the occurrence of type - i x - ray bursts , but the relation is not strict .",
    "the first two bursts were observed in an observation on october @xmath13 2001 ; the first pulsations a day later . during the third outburst",
    "we detect four bursts ; pulsations were only detected after the third one .",
    "we also detected pulsations with no preceding burst .",
    "the structure of our data does not allow us to tell if pulsations and/or other bursts occurred during data gaps .",
    "figure  [ fig : pds ] ( top ) illustrates the relation between pulsations and bursts .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsations varies strongly between @xmath2% and ( often ) undetectable ( 0.3% rms amplitude upper limit at the 95% confidence level ) .",
    "pulsations are seen right after the occurrence of the first and the third burst , but in the middle of the data pulsations are present without the detection of a preceding burst ( although a burst could have happened just before the start of this data segment ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : pds ] ( bottom ) we show a power spectrum and corresponding 260 kev pulse profile ( inset ) . in these data",
    "the pulsation is relatively hard ; the rms amplitude increases with energy from @xmath14% at 3  kev to @xmath15% at 13  kev .",
    "the 210  kev luminosity during the observations in which we detected pulsations was between 3 and @xmath16  ergs  s@xmath17 ( assuming a fixed @xmath18 @xmath19 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other observations at similar flux and those at higher ( up to @xmath20  ergs  s@xmath17 in observation 91050 - 03 - 06 - 00 ) and lower fluxes do not show pulsations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) . from 16 , 32 , 64 and 128  sec average colors we found no significant changes in the energy spectra correlated with the pulse - amplitude variations .",
    "we studied the pulse frequency drifts using power spectra of 128 , 256 and 512  sec data and find a clear 8.7 hours sinusoidal modulation which we interpret as due to doppler shifts by binary orbital motion with that period . in order to obtain an orbital solution",
    ", we performed a @xmath21 scan on the orbital parameters using the method described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our best estimates are listed in table  [ table : data ] . the combination of data gaps and intermittency of the pulsations yielded aliases , which are taken into account by the reported errors . in figure",
    "[ fig : phase ] we plot the pulse frequency as a function of orbital phase .",
    "we have discovered intermittent pulsations from the neutron - star lmxb sax  j1748.92021 . pulsations appear and disappear on time scales of hundreds of seconds .",
    "although we find a suggestive relation between the appearance of the pulsations and the occurrence of type - i x - ray bursts ( the pulsations appearing after a burst ) , the relation is not strict .",
    "we find bursts with no subsequent pulsations and pulsations with no preceding burst ( although a burst could have occurred in the preceding data gaps ) . from the doppler shifts on the pulsations",
    "we determine that the system is in a near - circular orbit with period of 8.7 hours and projected radius of 0.39 lightsec .",
    "the stability of the pulsations ( after correcting for the binary orbit ) strongly suggests that the pulsation frequency reflects the neutron star spin frequency and that sax  j1748.92021 is an accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar .",
    "the characteristics of the pulsations are reminiscent of the those found in hete  j1900.12455 : in both sources the pulsations were only intermittently detected and a possible relation between burst occurrence and pulse amplitude exists .",
    "however , there are differences : in hete  j1900.12455 the pulsations were only seen during the first two months of the outburst and their amplitude decreased steadily on timescales of days after the bursts which might have caused them to reappear @xcite . in sax",
    "j1748.92021 we find the pulsations in the middle of the 2001 and 2005 outbursts and not in the beginning .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the pulsations behaves erratically , switching between detection and non - detection on time scales of hundreds of seconds . despite these differences ,",
    "the behavior of the pulsations in both sources is so similar that we consider it likely that the same mechanism causes the intermittency of the pulsations in both .",
    "a related system might be aql  x-1 in which a short - lived ( @xmath0150  s ) and very rare ( duty cycle of 0.03% ) episode of strong pulsations at the neutron - star spin frequency has been detected @xcite . in this source ,",
    "no x - rays bursts were seen in the @xmath22  s before the pulsations , making it unlikely that they were triggered by a burst .",
    "it is unclear if the pulsations in aql x-1 were accretion  driven or due to unusual nuclear burning episodes ; the same applies to sax  j1748.92021 .",
    "the extreme rarity of the pulsations in aql x-1 could indicate that the mechanism behind them is different from that responsible for the pulsations in hete  j1900.12455 and sax  j1748.92021 .",
    "nevertheless , irrespective of the mechanisms behind the pulsations in these three sources , it is clear that a strict division between pulsating and non - pulsating sources can not be made anymore .",
    "it is possible that all sources pulsate occasionally although the recurrence times could be very long .    assuming a constant dipolar magnetic field , following @xcite ( i.e. , assuming a geometrically thin disk and neglecting inner disk wind mass loss , radiation drag and gr effects ) we estimate the magnetic field to be @xmath23  gauss .",
    "this assumes a 10  km radius @xmath24 neutron star and @xmath25 , the highest accretion rate at which pulses are detected , of 0.28 of the eddington critical value as derived from the luminosity observed at the time using a bolometric flux correction of 1.4 @xcite . in the standard magnetic channeling scenario",
    ", the question remains of what causes the large variations in pulse amplitude .",
    "comparisons between hete  j1900.12455 , sax  j1748.92021 and the other 7 amsps can provide clues to understand the pulse - strength variations . in sax  j1748.92021 and aql x-1 the time scales on which the pulse amplitude can fluctuate are as short as @xmath26  s , too short for the properties of the neutron star core to change @xcite .",
    "so , these changes must originate in the disk or the outer layers of the neutron star envelope .",
    "@xcite suggested ( for hete  j1900.12455 ) that the accumulation of matter on the surface burying the magnetic field @xcite plays a role .",
    "our results show that this mechanism probably can not work for sax  j1748.92021 , as the pulsations are not seen in the beginning of the outbursts , but instead @xmath15  weeks and @xmath27  weeks after the start of the 2001 and 2005 outbursts , respectively , so after a considerable amount of matter has already accreted .",
    "interestingly , we observe pulsations only around a mass accretion rate of @xmath28sec as inferred from the x - ray luminosity , not above or below , indicating that instantaneous mass accretion rate rather than total accreted mass is the important quantity .    in both hete",
    "j1900.12455 and sax  j1748.92021 the pulsations seem to appear together with bursts although the exact connection is complex .",
    "this suggests that surface processes may affect the magnetic field .",
    "hydrodynamic flows in the surface layer of the neutron star may screen the magnetic field ( see review by * ? ? ? * and references within ) ; perhaps violent processes like bursts temporarily affect such flows , diminishing screening and enhancing the channeling .",
    "alternatively , variations in a scattering or screening medium may cause the pulse amplitude modulation ( see e.g. discussions in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references within ) . for our results , the properties of such a medium should change on timescales of hundreds of seconds ; note that we did not detect spectral changes associated with pulse strength modulation .    with an orbital period of @xmath29 hours , this binary system is clearly not an ultra - compact binary as usually found in globular clusters and in fact , sax  j1748.92021 is the amsp with the longest orbital period after aql  x-1 , which has an orbital period of @xmath30  hrs @xcite .",
    "the mass - radius relation for a low - mass roche lobe - filling companion in a binary @xcite is @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the orbital period in hours , @xmath33 the mass of the neutron star , @xmath34 radius of the companion and @xmath35 , the mass ratio . given the mass function and the orbital period and assuming a @xmath24 neutron star , we plot in figure  [ fig : rvsm ] the mass - radius relationship for the companion star .",
    "given that the age of the globular cluster ngc 6440 is @xmath36 gyrs @xcite and its metallicity is approximately solar @xcite , in figure  [ fig : rvsm ] we also plot the isochrones for stars with ages of 8 and 12 gyrs and solar metallicity .",
    "stars with a @xmath37 can not fill the roche lobe while stars with @xmath38 would have a radius exceeding the roche lobe .",
    "this would imply a donor star mass of @xmath39 .",
    "however , for masses of 0.951.1@xmath40 , stars have evolved off the main sequence so binary mass transfer can have affected the radius of the donor star , which means we can not firmly exclude masses of 0.951.1@xmath40 . therefore a more conservative mass range for the donor star is 0.85 - 1.1@xmath40 .",
    "intriguingly , this requires the inclination to be about @xmath41 , which has a @xmath42 a priori probability for an isotropic sample of binary inclinations . of course , this estimate is assuming that sax  j1748.92021 is in a primordial binary .",
    "if a different evolutionary path took place ( e.g. dynamical interactions ) , the mass of the companion might be much smaller ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
