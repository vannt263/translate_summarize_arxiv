    "grain boundaries ( gbs ) and interfaces in general have a strong influence on mechanical behavior and other materials properties .",
    "therefore , they have been widely studied both experimentally @xcite and computationally @xcite for a long time . at high temperatures close to the melting point",
    ", gbs can display pronounced disorder , even leading to the formation of nanometer - scale intergranular films with liquid - like properties .",
    "the formation of those films below the bulk melting point , known as gb premelting , lead to catastrophic materials failure , initiated by an enormous reduction of the shear resistance .",
    "this phenomenon is of interest for predicting the formation of solidification defects associated with the formation of those intergranular films , which can lead to hot cracking during the late stages of solidification @xcite , and more generally for understanding the microstructure and mechanical behavior of structural alloys at high homologous temperature .    over the years",
    ", there have been many experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations of gb premelting .",
    "the latter include discrete lattice models @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite , as well as conventional phase - field models @xcite , which either exploit an orientational order parameter @xcite or multiple phase - fields @xcite to distinguish between grains , and the phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) method @xcite , which resolves the crystal density field on an atomic scale and hence naturally models crystal defects such as isolated dislocations and gbs .",
    "the determination of the premelted layer width @xmath0 and the quantification of the fundamental forces that control this width are of striking interest for gb premelting .",
    "experimentally , these issues are difficult to address . observations to date support the existence of a nanometer - thick premelted layer in pure materials a few degrees below the bulk melting point and there is more ample evidence for premelting in alloys . modeling activities based on pfc @xcite and md simulations @xcite allow characterization of the structural forces underlying gb premelting .",
    "these forces are quantified by the introduction of the `` disjoining potential '' @xmath1 , which is defined via the excess gibbs free - energy per unit of grain boundary area @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bulk gibbs free - energy difference between liquid ( @xmath4 ) and solid ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 is the solid - liquid interfacial free - energy . based on this definition , @xmath1 represents the part of this excess due to the overlap of crystal density waves from the two grains on each side of the gb ( see fig .",
    "[ intro::sketch ] ) .",
    "the ordering of the solid phases extends also into the melt on the range of the interface thickness @xmath7 , thus the crystals start to interact with each other as soon as their separation @xmath0 is of the order of the interface thickness . depending on the alignment of the crystals their structures may match  which leads to an attractive interaction  or are locally displaced such that the energy of the system is increased by the overlap , which leads to a repulsive interaction .",
    "hence the derivative @xmath8 expresses the force between crystal - melt interfaces due to this overlap , which can be either repulsive or attractive depending on whether the sign of @xmath8 is positive or negative , respectively .",
    "so far , there is little analytical knowledge on the short range contributions to these forces , with the exception of phase - field models @xcite , which are based on phenomenological models that do not consider atomic structures , dislocation formation and elastic interactions .",
    "the purpose of the present article is therefore to gain analytical insights into the nature of these forces , based on a complex ginzburg - landau description .",
    "additionally , @xmath1 also contains attractive contributions due to london dispersion forces that are neither accounted for in pfc and md simulations , nor in the short range forces analyzed here , but play an important role in other systems such as ceramic materials @xcite .",
    "however , in metallic systems , dispersion forces can be estimated to only contribute an attractive tail to @xmath1 whose magnitude is less than a mj / m@xmath9 for @xmath0 on the nanometer scale .",
    "in contrast , md computations of @xmath1 in pure ni @xcite show that @xmath1 has a magnitude of tens of mj / m@xmath9 for @xmath0 in this same range .",
    "a major outcome of this work is that the structural interaction can be calculated analytically in the case of zero misorientation between the grains , which only have a translational misfit .",
    "the range of the interaction can still be computed also for the more general case of misoriented crystals .",
    "the results therefore offer new insights into the phenomenon of gb premelting , as they show which quantities and ingredients are essential for the structural interactions .",
    "this paper therefore complements the numerical results in ref .",
    ", which compare pfc and amplitude equations results with md data .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ ae ] the underlying model is summarized , which is then used in section [ sl ] to investigate the properties of single solid - melt interfaces .",
    "there , in particular , the decay of the density waves into the melt is analyzed , since this turns out to be the key parameter for the interaction of two solid - melt interfaces .",
    "first , in section [ interfaceinteraction ] the special case of crystals without misorientation but with translational misfit is considered , as here the asymptotics of the interaction can be calculated fully analytically , which is demonstrated for several interface orientations . in section [ misoriented ] grain boundaries",
    "are considered ; although a full analytical treatment is not possible here , still the range of the interaction can be predicted .",
    "from the classical density functional theory of freezing ( dft ) a functional can be derived which expresses an emerging solid phase as density fluctuations appearing from the liquid state , whereas the ( time - averaged ) density is spatially constant in the melt phase @xcite . to this",
    "end the spatial variations of the density field @xmath10 , are expanded as a sum of density waves @xmath11 where each @xmath12 is one of the @xmath13 different reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlvs ) and @xmath14 are their associated amplitudes . in the liquid phase , where the time averaged density is spatially constant , the amplitudes vanish , and in an undistorted solid phase they all attain the same constant value , @xmath15 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath19 is the density in the liquid state and @xmath20 is the direct correlation function with fourier transform @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; it is related to the liquid structure factor by @xmath24 here , all quantities are evaluated at the ( first ) peak of the structure factor @xmath25 . unlike dft , where a large number of modes is required to obtain sharp peaks around atomic positions , the simpler free energy allows for a truncation of this sum to a small set of reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "various methods have been developed to change the kernel of the free energy in order to stabilize a variety of two and three dimensional periodic and crystal structures .",
    "here we focus on bcc structures , therefore we restrict the summation to the @xmath26 principal reciprocal vectors @xmath27 , [ 101 ] , [ 011 ] , [ 1\\bar{1}0 ] , [ 10\\bar{1 } ] , [ 01\\bar{1 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ \\bar{1}\\bar{1}0 ] , [ \\bar{1}0\\bar{1 } ] , [ 0\\bar{1}\\bar{1 } ] , [ \\bar{1}10 ] , [ \\bar{1}01 ] , [ 0\\bar{1}1].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that by the condition of having a real density field @xmath28 the @xmath13 complex amplitudes are not independent but are complex conjugate ( denoted by a star ) for antiparallel rlvs . therefore , we restrict the description to the first row of these rlvs and use only @xmath29 independent complex fields @xmath14 .    the differential operator @xmath30 is given by @xcite @xmath31 where the vectors @xmath32 are the normalized principal rlvs .",
    "the second term in the operator preserves the rotational invariance of the equations and is related to the use of the nonlinear strain tensor in elasticity .",
    "below we refer to this second term as the higher order correction term in the box operator , since it is vanishingly small for rough interfaces .    for most of the present analysis",
    "the precise form of the higher order nonlinearities is not important , as they enter the expressions for the interface interaction only as prefactors in terms of matching constants .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath38 is spatially constant . a detailed derivation of the amplitude equations , which describe the evolution of the fields @xmath39 has been given in refs .  ,",
    "and therefore we only give the resulting expressions here .",
    "the evolution equations can be derived from a free energy functional , which reads @xmath40 + f_t . \\label{fenae}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have introduced rescaled amplitudes @xmath41 also , we have introduced a dimensionless length scale @xmath42 in these rescaled coordinates the box operator becomes @xmath43 and the prefactor @xmath44 is @xmath45 finally , the thermal tilt @xmath46 is added phenomenologically , @xmath47 to favor either the solid or liquid state . here , @xmath48 is the melting temperature , @xmath49 the latent heat and @xmath50 is an `` order parameter '' which discriminates between solid and liquid , @xmath51 with @xmath52    alternatively , the tilt can be chosen such that it reproduces the pfc results , and then the coupling function is chosen to be @xmath53 we note that this expression is invariant under elastic deformations and lattice rotations , which affect the complex phases of the amplitudes . in the original dft formulation",
    "the coupling therefore reads @xmath54    we note that the two above coupling functions ( [ tilt::eq2 ] ) and ( [ tilt::eq3 ] ) are substantially different : the first is quartic in the amplitudes variations in the solid and liquid state , and therefore the minima of the functional remain at @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "this is not the case for the second coupling , which is linear in the amplitudes ; therefore here the bulk values depend on the temperature .",
    "we will discuss the implications of these two different couplings in appendix [ lincoupling ] .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to a stationary state of the free energy functional , and we use relaxation dynamics according to @xmath58 since we focus here exclusively on static situations , the choice of the kinetic coefficients @xmath59 is arbitrary .",
    "this description predicts the correct anisotropy of surfaces energies @xcite and elastic properties and contains naturally the linear theory of elasticity @xcite .",
    "the form of these nonlinearities depends slightly on the underlying model : above it is given for a pfc model , and there are some differences if these terms are derived from dft using an equal weight ansatz",
    ". however , the differences are small and lead e.g.  only to tiny changes of the anisotropy of the surface energy , as had been investigated in ref .  .",
    "also , we point out that  as will be shown in the following sections  the higher order nonlinearities do not contribute to the short - range interaction tail for shifted crystals .",
    "finally , we note that this amplitude equations model for crystals is conceptually close to theories of superconductivity and pattern formation in hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "properties of solid - melt interfaces , in particular interfacial energies and their anisotropy , were discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "here we concentrate on specific properties that are relevant for the understanding of interface interactions in the next section .    in the melt region sufficiently far away from the interface , the amplitudes of the density waves have decayed and can be well described by the linearized equilibrium conditions or , equivalently , the free - energy density with the local terms up to second order in the amplitudes .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the free energy functionals , as derived from pfc and dft , agree up to this order , and therefore the following results are generic .",
    "let the interface normal @xmath60 be the @xmath61 direction of a straight solid - liquid interface , and all density wave amplitudes depend then only on this coordinate . in the liquid ,",
    "where the solid ordering has decayed almost completely , the equilibrium conditions decouple and are given by @xmath62 where we ignore for the moment the higher order corrections of the box operator . for reasons that will become more obvious later",
    ", we denote here derivatives with respect to @xmath61 by a dot .",
    "although we consider a three - dimensional situation , the amplitudes depend only on @xmath61 .",
    "we focus here on stationary states , therefore time - derivatives do not appear .",
    "obviously , ( stationary ) coexistence between solid and liquid bulk phases with a planar interface is only possible for @xmath63 .",
    "the general solution of this linearized equilibrium condition is a superposition of two exponentials , @xmath64 with the inverse decay length @xmath65 we also define the characteristic scale @xmath66 @xmath67 since we consider only a single interface , with the solid phase being located at @xmath68 , the growing exponential can not be present ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we note that a shift of the interface by @xmath70 leads to a change of the remaining exponential prefactor @xmath71 by a factor @xmath72 .",
    "since the problem is one - dimensional , it is straightforward and fast to solve the full set of amplitude equations ( not only in the linearized region ) using a real space implementation via the relaxation scheme ( [ relaxscheme ] ) at @xmath63 , until an equilibrium solid - liquid interface is established .",
    "the grid spacing is chosen to be much smaller than the interface thickness , @xmath73 , to obtain results which do not depend on the discretization .",
    "corresponding to the analytical investigation we do not take into account the higher order term in the box operator , thus the equilibrium profile is described by a second order ordinary differential equation . from the equilibrium",
    "profile the solid - liquid interfacial energy @xmath6 is also computed . to obtain a numerical value for the prefactor @xmath71 we have to match it to the full solution of the nonlinear problem @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we set the origin @xmath75 exactly at the location of the interface . since the interface is smooth , the position of it requires a precise definition .",
    "the choice of this measure is not critical , since another definition only leads to slightly different values for the exponential prefactors , and later on in the following sections , to a horizontal shift of the disjoining potential .",

    "notice that in the liquid the amplitudes have decayed to zero , whereas in the solid all of them have the value @xmath78 .    for a single solid - liquid interface ,",
    "the amount of liquid depends of course on the system size , i.e.  the length of the integration interval @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the interface position ) , @xmath0 becomes a linear function of @xmath79 , @xmath82 .",
    "we can extrapolate this linear function to the value @xmath83 , which then defines the location of the interface , and this is shown in fig .",

    "for @xmath88 they decay exponentially on the scale @xmath89 , and we can determine the exponential prefactors as shown in fig .",
    "[ single::fig3 ] .",
    "we note that for a single interface all amplitudes can be chosen to be purely real ( as long as the correction from the box operator is suppressed ) . for a ( 100 ) surface ,",

    "this means that they decay faster , as they are `` slaved '' by the other fields ( see fig .",
    "[ single::fig3 ] ) .        as explained in ref .",
    "the density waves can therefore be grouped into two classes .",
    "the matching constant for the slowly decaying fields is then determined numerically as @xmath95 for the definition of the interface position given above ( the subscript denotes the density wave , the superscript the interface normal ) .",

    "the range of these slaved fields is very short , and therefore they do not contribute significantly to the interaction potentials derived below .",

    "[ single::fig5 ] .",
    "is not determined by quadratic but cubic interactions .",
    ", width=302 ]    let us briefly discuss the relevance of the box operator corrections to the preceding results .",
    "so far , a single straight interface is in principle described by a real density wave amplitude , or at least by a constant complex phase .",
    "the box operator explicitly introduces an imaginary factor , and therefore the amplitudes pick up a small and slow oscillatory contribution .",
    "also , the results without the higher order corrections ( as given on the slow scale ) , do not yet depend on the value of @xmath36 , which is only re - introduced when the density profile is reconstructed from the amplitudes . with the correction terms , @xmath36 appears also explicitly in the amplitude equations .",
    "the linearized equations in the liquid region become @xmath107 and in one dimension @xmath108 the general solution of the linearized problem then becomes @xmath109 with four independent solutions , since the equation is now of fourth order .",
    "the new decay scales are given by @xmath110 with the abbreviations @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "hence we have for the real parts the relation @xmath113 , which means that the solutions with superscript @xmath114 are growing solutions and the ones with @xmath115 are decaying solutions , all with the same range .",
    "notice that they all also have oscillatory contributions , i.e.  a non - vanishing imaginary part , @xmath116 .",
    "we also have obviously @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "these relations are important for the proper matching of incoming and outgoing waves in the interface region between the two grains .",
    "they imply @xmath119 and @xmath120 , therefore the oscillation frequency is equal for corresponding decaying and growing solutions .",
    "also , the growth rates @xmath121 are only weakly imaginary in contrast to @xmath122 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we find numerically that amplitudes of the strongly oscillatory solutions are very small , @xmath123 , since an interface should mainly be a decay and not an oscillation of the density waves  the latter corresponds to a local change of the lattice spacing ; the oscillatory modes can therefore safely be neglected . for @xmath124 iron",
    "we have @xmath125 ( i.e.",
    "@xmath126 ) , and for this value @xmath127 is only very slightly changed , and the amplitudes almost undistinguishable .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath127 formally becomes complex and that the decay rates @xmath128 for the incoming and outgoing waves are slightly different , but for present small values of @xmath36 this difference can be neglected .",
    "the simplest case of interacting solids is that of two lattices of the same material and with the same structure that are perfectly aligned up to a translation in the contact plane , i.e.  without misorientation between them ( see fig .  [ shift::fig1 ] ) .    , is not shown .",
    "we assume that in the normal direction the crystals are not shifted , as illustrated by the dotted circles.,width=302 ]    if the crystals are fully aligned , which means that the atomic planes match , the interaction between the solid - melt interfaces is attractive , because exactly at the melting point ( @xmath63 ) merging of the crystals removes two solid - melt interfaces , which reduces the total energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is more complicated if the crystals are shifted against each other , which implies elastic deformations of the lattices close to the grain interface .",
    "as we will show , a sufficiently large mismatch can lead to repulsive interactions .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the asymptotic of this structural interaction between the crystals can be calculated fully analytically from the free - energy expression .",
    "the procedure is as follows : we assume two parallel crystal surfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ shift::fig1 ] ) , which are separated by a melt layer of thickness @xmath0 . for large @xmath0 , the density wave amplitudes are almost decayed in the center of the melt , and it is therefore sufficient to consider only the free energy terms up to quadratic order in the amplitudes .",
    "the related equilibrium equations are therefore linear and can be solved easily , and the corresponding ( approximative ) solution has to be matched to the exact solution of the full problem of a localized interface at @xmath129 . by the means of this matching , we get an analytical expression for the disjoining potential .    we start the analysis with the derivation of a conservation law . as before ,",
    "we first ignore the higher order correction that stems from the box operator .",
    "the full free - energy expressions ( [ ae::eq2 ] ) and ( [ fenae ] ) have the structure @xmath130 where @xmath131 depends only on local terms ( no gradients of the amplitudes ) , whereas @xmath132 contains only first order derivative terms .",
    "notice that due to the parallel structure , all amplitudes depend only on the coordinate @xmath61 perpendicular to the interfaces .",
    "equilibrium demands @xmath133 for all fields @xmath134 .    for a solid - melt - solid layer system ,",
    "the free energy is in the spirit of equation ( [ gbexc ] ) @xmath135 in the present case of the underlying nvt ensemble .",
    "the bulk free energy density difference @xmath136 for a temperature deviation from the melting temperature @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath137 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gbexc ] ) and will be discussed in detail below .    to emphasize the analogy to a problem in classical mechanics , we use a dot for the spatial derivative in @xmath61 direction .",
    "the `` hamiltonian '' , @xmath138 is then a `` constant of motion '' , i.e.  it does not depend on the @xmath61 coordinate , @xmath139 for interfaces that are far apart , the amplitudes have almost decayed to zero in the melt region , and all contributions which are higher than qudratic in the amplitudes give only negligible corrections .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath140 the corresponding linearized `` equations of motion '' which describe the small amplitudes in the liquid region are therefore again given by eqs .",
    "( [ single::eq1])-([single::eq3 ] ) , with the only difference that we have here two interfaces , and therefore both exponentials are present . from this solution",
    "we can calculate the hamiltonian in a quadratic approximation , @xmath141 we can choose the origin @xmath75 in the center between the two interfaces , and then the exponential prefactors have the same absolute value but can differ by their phase , @xmath142 . furthermore , from the general solution ( [ single::eq2 ] ) it is obvious that a translation of the interface position in the normal direction increases or decreases the prefactors @xmath143 by an exponential factor @xmath144 , where @xmath70 is the shift distance .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath145 ; the matching constants @xmath146 were determined already in the previous section .",
    "hence , @xmath147 in general , it is necessary to introduce a tilt term to favor either the liquid or the solid state , because otherwise a repulsive or attractive interaction between the interfaces would forbid the existence of a stationary solution ( stable or unstable ) with a specific melt layer thickness @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore have to raise or lower the free energy density of the solid phase relative to the liquid by @xmath136 .",
    "in particular , overheating above the melting point corresponds to @xmath148 . notice that for the following calculation of the asymptotic interface interaction the precise form of the coupling in @xmath149 is not important , and only the tilt @xmath150 enters into the result , provided that the bulk states @xmath151 and @xmath15 are temperature independent",
    "this is the case e.g. for the coupling function ( [ tilt::eq2a ] ) , or  more generally  if the coupling function does not have a linear term in the amplitude variation @xmath152 in the solid and @xmath153 in the melt phase .",
    "the case that a linear term exists will be discussed in more detail below in appendix [ lincoupling ] .    in the solid ,",
    "the amplitudes are ( up to a phase factor ) all equal to @xmath154 , the gradients vanish , and therefore the hamiltonian becomes @xmath155 comparison of this exact value , calculated from the solid phase , and the asymptotic value for large interface separations ( [ shift::eq8 ] ) , calculated from the liquid phase , using the conservation law ( [ shift::eq2b ] ) we obtain an implicit relation for the ( asymptotic ) width of the liquid layer @xmath0 as function of the deviation from the melting point , @xmath150 .",
    "asymptotically , only the slowest decaying density waves with the smallest inverse decay length @xmath156 contribute to the hamiltonian , and we get @xmath157 thus @xmath158 this expression diverges logarithmically at the melting point , where @xmath159 is the equilibrium solution . if @xmath160 is positive , we find an asymptotic solution only for @xmath161 .",
    "the interfaces _ attract _ each other , and this has to be compensated by overheating , i.e.  favoring the liquid phase .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath162 , we have _ repulsive _ solutions asymptotically only below the melting point .    at shorter distances",
    "the other density waves also contribute , and we therefore have to sum over all of them , which leads to an implicit relation for the melt layer thickness as function of temperature , @xmath163 which follows directly from eqs .",
    "( [ shift::eq8 ] ) and ( [ shift::eq9 ] ) .",
    "this expression is valid as long as the overlap of the density waves is still small , such that the nonlinear energy contributions can be neglected .",
    "we can interpret the free energy shift @xmath150 as the chemical force that balances the interface interaction .",
    "in fact , for a single interface it is the driving force for melting or solidification . from the equilibrium condition",

    "since their contribution vanished quickly in the melt phase , it is intuitively clear , that the interaction range for misoriented grains is shorter than for shifted crystals .",
    "one can interpret this statement also in a physical way : for two misoriented grains the normal shift between lattice planes of the two crystals varies along the grain boundary , and therefore the interface alternatingly consists of region , where the atomic planes match and where they are out of phase .",
    "this leads to alternations of attractive and repulsive regions along the grain boundary .",
    "since the strength and size of attractive and repulsive regions is equal at quadratic order , their contributions cancel each other in the total interaction energy between the grains .",
    "thus , only shorter range higher order terms can be responsible for the disjoining potential here .    to understand the range of the remaining interaction further , one can continue to employ the conservation law ( [ gencons::eq5 ] ) .",
    "the next step is to assume that the interaction stems from the cubic terms in the functional .",
    "they can appear in two different ways : first , products of two incoming and one outgoing waves or one incoming and two outgoing waves from expression ( [ misoriented::eq1 ] ) .",

    "the entire interaction is a superposition of the contributions of the different density waves , and the longest range fields at a solid - liquid interface , i.e.  those density waves which extend the crystalline ordering furthest into the melt , also give the longest - range contribution to the solid - melt interface interaction .",
    "the range of this interface interaction is given by eq .",
    "( [ single::eq3 ] ) for the individual density waves .",
    "this analytical expression also shows that the range of the interaction is determined by scattering properties of the melt phase and the relative orientation of the density wave vector to the interface normal .",
    "the case of purely translated grains describes unstable configurations or repulsive interactions , since strong lateral forces will force the system back to configurations with aligned crystallographic planes .",
    "nevertheless , the results shall be relevant for the understanding of the merging of dendrite sidearms from the same grain , where due to elastic deformations the lattices in the sidebranches are shifted against each other .",
    "apart from the remarkable feature that the interaction and its origin can be understood fully analytically , we also mention the relation to the similar concept of @xmath247-surfaces@xcite  the energy landscape of two half crystals are which are tangentially displaced against each other  which is essential for the understanding of stacking faults and other defect formation mechanisms . here",
    ", we obtain a fully analytical prediction of this lateral dependence of this energy landscape for solid - melt - solid layer systems at larger distances .    at this point",
    "we also mention that the term interaction must not be interpreted as a mechanical force that leads to an interaction between the grains , but rather a thermodynamic force .",
    "the central difference is that a mechanical attraction e.g.  would move the grains towards each other , so each atom moves . here , however , we consider the situation of a melt layer that separates the two grains , and therefore the attraction between the grains would manifest in the solidification of the melt layer . as a consequence , the gap between the crystal is closed , but without a rigid body motion of the entire grain .",
    "in other words , during the solidification process the number of atoms in the solid phases increases , whereas it would be conserved for a purely mechanical motion .",
    "this aspect is also important from another point of view : in the consideration of the shifted crystals we have excluded translations in normal direction ( @xmath61 direction ) and only investigated motion in the tangential @xmath248 plane .",
    "this means that the atomic planes are always aligned in the normal direction and only exhibit a mismatch in the others .",
    "one could also consider the translation in @xmath61 direction , which would then lead to an additional oscillatory interaction dependence in this direction .",
    "this @xmath70 dependence is not related to the exponential decay of the disjoining potential , which appears separately on a larger scale .    beyond the case of pure grain translation",
    "we have also considered grain boundaries with a misorientation . in this case , a full analytical calculation of the disjoining potential is not possible anymore and numerical investigations are needed @xcite . nevertheless , we have explained that the interaction then stems from higher order terms in the free energy functional , since the longest - range contributions from quadratic terms cancel . as a result",
    ", we find that the disjoining potential decays twice faster then for shifted crystals .",
    "this prediction of the interaction range is confirmed also by numerical simulations and further discussed in ref .  .",
    "thanks the the dfg collaborative research center 761 _ steel  ab initio _ for financial support .",
    "the difference between the coupling functions ( [ tilt::eq2 ] ) and ( [ tilt::eq3 ] ) is that the first is quartic in the amplitude variations in the bulk states and the latter linear . from this",
    "we immediately conclude that in the first case it is not necessary to take the tilt term into account for the solution of the linearized equations in the liquid region , as it is of higher order , and it appears there only effectively through the energy shift as the value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the situation is different for the linear coupling , and different effects have to be taken into account formally : ( i ) the amplitudes in the liquid change since the minimum of the potential energy is shifted away from @xmath151 for @xmath57 , ( ii ) the amplitudes in the solid change since the minimum of the potential energy is shifted away from @xmath15 for @xmath57 , ( iii ) the thermal tilt gives a contribution to the hamiltonian in the liquid , which needs to be taken into account up to second order , and ( iv ) the value of the hamiltonian changes in the solid due to the shift of the solid amplitudes .    at a first glance",
    ", one may therefore expect that the results are changed by these effects , and that the long range interaction should depend on the precise choice of the coupling function .",
    "however , here we show that this is not the case up to linear order in @xmath249 . for simplicity",

    "we consider from now only the case of real amplitudes , i.e.  no crystal translation , @xmath254 .",
    "then the general solution is @xmath255 where the decay parameters are unchanged and given by eq .",
    "( [ single::eq3 ] ) .",
    "the constant term is @xmath256    in the same way , we can analyze the behavior in the solid phases , where the amplitudes are constant .",
    "one readily finds that the deviation from the previous bulk value @xmath15 is linear in the temperature deviation @xmath249 .",
    "the expression for the hamiltonian up to second order in the amplitudes also now contains the tilt term , @xmath257 inserting the above solution gives up to first order in @xmath249 the same expression ( [ shift::eq7 ] ) as before .    in the solid ,",
    "the value deviates from the previous expression @xmath258 only by quadratic corrections in @xmath150 .",
    "consequently , the long range interaction is unaffected by the choice of the linear instead of a higher order coupling function for the temperature .",
    "as has been demonstrated in section [ interfaceinteraction ] the consideration of the hamiltonian @xmath259 as a conserved quantity is a valuable way to understand the interaction of two crystals , which have the same lattice orientation but are shifted against each other .",
    "the limitations were ( i ) the neglect of the box operator correction and ( ii ) the restriction to pure translations , which forbids the analysis of grain boundaries , where the crystals are misoriented .",
    "for the shifted crystals , the translation leads to a multiplication of the amplitudes by a spatially constant phase factor .",
    "the main difference is that a rotation leads to non - constant phase factors . in particular , the amplitudes then do not depend only on a single coordinate normal to the grain boundary , but on all spatial coordinates .",
    "therefore , a proper conservation law should also take into account the directions parallel to the interface .",
    "we consider a `` lagrangian '' ( i.e.  the free energy density in the present context ) of the form @xmath260 where expressions like @xmath261 denote the set of all amplitudes @xmath14 . for simplicity , we assume that all fields depend only on two coordinates , which we choose to be normal and tangential to the interface .",
    "this is the case e.g. for tilt grain boundaries , and a twist would require the straightforward inclusion of another tangential dependence . derivatives with respect to these directions are denoted by a dot for the normal and a prime for the tangential direction , although this assignment of directions is in principle arbitrary ; however , it will turn out to be a useful choice .",
    "we align our coordinate system such that @xmath262 is the normal and @xmath263 the tangential direction .",
    "in contrast to the pure hamiltonian system in the previous section here also higher order derivatives appear .",
    "it turns out that in our case mixed mode derivatives like @xmath264 do not appear , and therefore we do not consider them .",
    "we introduce generalized momenta , @xmath265 here , @xmath14 and @xmath206 are treated as independent variables .",

    "the expressions are written here for a two - dimensional dependence of the fields , which is the case of tilt boundaries in a three - dimensional system .",

    "<S> we predict the structural interaction of crystalline solid - melt interfaces using amplitude equations which are derived from classical density functional theory or phase - field - crystal modeling . </S>",
    "<S> the solid ordering decays exponentially on the scale of the interface thickness at solid - melt interfaces ; the overlap of two such profiles leads to a short range interaction , which is mainly carried by the longest - range density waves , which can facilitate grain boundary premelting . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the tail of these interactions , depending on the relative translation of the two crystals fully analytically and predict the interaction potential , and compare it to numerical simulations . for grain boundaries </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is predicted to decay twice faster as for two crystals without misorientation . </S>"
