    "in stochastic inflation , one is interested in the behavior of a coarse - grained field @xmath0 obtained after taking the spatial average of the original inflaton field over a volume the size of which is of the order of a hubble patch .",
    "the coarse - grained field obeys a langevin equation that can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the inflaton potential and @xmath3 a white noise defined such that its correlation function simply reads @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the dirac distribution .",

    "@xcite , see in particular figs .  2 and  3 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the issue that we now address is the reliability of the method of approximation used in order to establish these results .",
    "an important question is the determination of the interval in which the perturbed solution of the langevin equation that we have obtained , @xmath41 , remains a good approximation of the exact one .",
    "indeed , initially , the perturbed solution is `` by definition '' a good approximation since we have @xmath42 .",
    "then , as the field evolves from @xmath43 , we expect @xmath44 and @xmath12 to grow and the approximation to break down at some value of @xmath45 .",
    "_ a priori _ , the criterion of validity is simply @xmath46 . but things can be more complicated . for instance , let us assume that the classical field is initially very small , as is the case for new inflation",
    ". then , @xmath47 becomes large very quickly ( because @xmath10 is very small ) , apparently signaling a breakdown of the approximation .",
    "however , it is clear that this could just be an artifact of the criterion used which , somehow , would be too naive . to illustrate this last point ,",
    "let us consider the following simple example .",
    "suppose that we want to calculate @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a given function that we do not need to specify explicitly .",
    "taylor expanding this expression leads to @xmath50 and , in general , this expression gives a good approximation provided that @xmath51 .",
    "however , if the derivatives of @xmath49 are very small around @xmath10 , then the approximation can be good even if @xmath52 is much larger than could naively be expected .",
    "we will see that , in the case of the perturbative expansion of the langevin equation , we are exactly in this situation .",
    "the deep reason for that is the fact that the role of the derivatives of @xmath49 is now played by the derivatives of the hubble parameter . since these ones are necessarily small as long as the slow - roll approximation is satisfied , one can expect the previous phenomenon to happen .",
    "therefore , it is important not to underestimate the reliability of the perturbative expansion and to study this issue carefully .    in the following ,",
    "we address this question from a slightly different point of view , focusing on the langevin equation itself rather than on its exact solution which is , of course , unknown .",
    "our goal is to find a criterion that controls when the perturbed equation that we are able to solve is a good approximation of the exact one .",
    "this is a simpler task since we now compare known `` objects '' . at this point",
    ", one can even dare an analogy .",
    "the situation under consideration is indeed similar to what is done with the slow - roll approximation , for instance for the klein - gordon equation . in this case",
    ", one does not compare the exact solution ( which is , most of the time , unknown as well ) to the slow - roll one .",
    "one rather studies how small the term that we neglect in the exact equation ( @xmath53 ) is in comparison with the term that we keep ( @xmath54 ) , _",
    "i.e.  _ we study the magnitude of the slow - roll parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the spirit of the method that we use below is along the same line . finally , before embarking on the discussion of the reliability of the approximation used here , let us stress again that , so far and despite its importance , this question has not been given a satisfactory answer in the literature on the subject .    in order to determine the accuracy of the expansion",
    ", we will make use of the lagrange remainder theorem @xcite for the error in a taylor expansion .",
    "this theorem states that any function @xmath56 around some value @xmath10 can be written as @xmath57 for some value of the parameter @xmath58 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "let us emphasize that this expression is exact and does not assume anything on @xmath61 , in particular does not assume @xmath62 .",
    "the next step is to apply this theorem to the langevin equation , @xmath63 , more precisely to the function @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the left and right hand sides respectively . in our case , we take @xmath66 since we have considered the perturbative expansion of the langevin equation up to second order in the noise .",
    "this gives @xmath67 where we have used the classical equation of motion and where , according to eq .",
    "( [ lagrange ] ) , we have @xmath68 we stress again that , despite its resemblance with eqs .",
    "( [ eqdefi1 ] ) and  ( [ eqdefi2 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eqexact ] ) is an exact equation determining @xmath69 ( hence the exact stochastic field @xmath70 ) , as long as some values of the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 are suitably chosen between @xmath59 and @xmath60 . at this stage",
    ", this is just a complicated way to re - write the exact langevin equation  ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "the main idea is now to assume that the truncated expansion is reliable for values of @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are small in comparison with the other terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqexact ] ) . indeed , if this is the case , then the approximated eqs .",
    "( [ eqdefi1 ] ) and ( [ eqdefi2 ] ) become indistinguishable from the exact one  ( [ eqexact ] ) .",
    "more precisely , for each value of @xmath10 , we have to find the limiting values @xmath76 and @xmath77 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are small in comparison with the other terms in the equation of motion .",
    "then , the validity of the perturbative treatment will be guaranteed as long as @xmath78 or , in other words , as long as we have @xmath79 $ ] . in practice , since we are dealing with stochastic quantities , instead of @xmath80 , we will apply our criterion to the quantity @xmath81 , @xmath18 being evaluated with or without the volume effects .",
    "however , to explicitly derive @xmath82 and @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ eqexact ] ) can not be used directly because we do not know the values of @xmath71 and @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to take the maximum of the absolute value of the lagrange remainders ( for @xmath85 $ ] ) in order to get an upper bound on the error . therefore , the approximation is reliable , _ i.e.  _ @xmath74 and @xmath75 are negligible , when the two following conditions @xmath86 } \\left\\vert    \\frac{h^{(4)}(x)}{6}{\\delta\\varphi}^3\\right\\vert \\ll \\left\\vert    \\frac{h'''_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{2}\\right\\vert{\\delta\\varphi}^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath87 } \\left\\vert \\frac {    \\left(h^{3/2}\\right)''(x)}{2}\\right\\vert { \\delta\\varphi}^2     \\ll \\left\\vert    \\left(h^{3/2}_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\right)'{\\delta\\varphi}\\right \\vert\\ ] ] hold , while it breaks down when ( for fixed values of @xmath88 ) at least one of the two is violated .",
    "the limiting values @xmath82 and @xmath83 are then determined by requiring that the two above inequalities become equalities .",
    "since we have two equations and each of them involves absolute values , this gives two positive and two negative solutions , the actual value of @xmath82 and @xmath83 clearly being the one leading to the tightest constraint .    having determined @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the above procedure",
    ", one must also take into account the fact that we are dealing with stochastic quantities . in this respect ,",
    "the validity of the perturbative treatment will be guaranteed as long as the probability of finding @xmath89 , is sufficiently close to @xmath60 . in terms of probability",
    ", this means that one requires @xmath90 \\simeq 1 \\ , , \\ ] ] where we have considered @xmath15 as the probability density function . in the case where the volume effects are taken into account , @xmath21 should be used instead .",
    "finally , there is yet another constraint coming from the fact that , in general , @xmath91 , is a good approximation only if @xmath92 .",
    "this is necessary if we want to `` separate '' eq .",
    "( [ eqexact ] ) into two equations , one for @xmath11 and one for @xmath12 .",
    "let us now see how the previous considerations work in practice for the chaotic inflation potential @xmath93 . in this particular case",
    ", @xmath91 is an exact solution of the approximated second order equation since @xmath94 and the constraint @xmath95 does not apply .",
    "in addition , we also have @xmath96 and , as a consequence , the limiting values @xmath97 and @xmath98 are found only from the constraint   involving @xmath75 . using the slow - roll equations of motion , one has @xmath99 and @xmath100 . the next step is to evaluate the maximum of this last function in the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "let us start with the upper bound .",
    "since @xmath102 one has @xmath103 , _ i.e.  _ @xmath104",
    ". then one can solve for @xmath98 .",
    "applying eq .",
    ", one arrives at @xmath105 from which one obtains @xmath106 .",
    "let us now consider the lower bound @xmath107 . the maximum of the function @xmath108 is now given by @xmath109 , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , in this case , solving the corresponding equality   requires to solve a second order algebraic equation in @xmath111 , namely @xmath112 and the result reads @xmath113 .",
    "gathering the two limits obtained before , one finds that the reliability interval is given by @xmath114 this interval is represented in fig .",
    "[ limits_chao ] ( left panel ) by the uniformly colored ( grey ) region .",
    "one clearly sees that this region is limited by two straight lines as calculated above . as inflation proceeds , the allowed region shrinks",
    "this has to be compared with @xmath115 represented by the hatched ( blue ) area .",
    "the lower border line of the hatched ( blue ) region is @xmath116 while the upper border line is @xmath117 .",
    "the two lines meet at the beginning of inflation where they vanish since @xmath118 . as long as the hatched region lies within the uniformly colored one ,",
    "the approximation is reliable .",
    "when this is no longer the case , the approximation breaks down . in fig .",
    "[ limits_chao ] , this is signaled by the vertical dotted - dashed line and occurs for @xmath119 .",
    "it is clear that the second order approximation is good until one approaches the end of slow - roll inflation .",
    "the right panel of the same figure shows the probability of finding @xmath91 between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , computed according to eqs .",
    "( [ probaaccuracy ] ) and  ( [ eqrelia ] ) , and confirms the previous conclusion .    when volume effects are considered , the situation becomes conceptually more complicated but the same ideas can be utilized to check the accuracy of the volume - weighted distribution . in particular , one should now compare the region limited by @xmath120 with the reliability region . in the case of large field models , however , we do not plot this region because the volume effects are so important that the corresponding region would be outside the figure .",
    "this will be done for the other models , see below .",
    "one can also use the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ probaaccuracy ] ) but this time , as already mentioned above , the probability should be evaluated with the distribution @xmath121 rather than with @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding results can strongly differ since the field realizations having higher potential energy ( _ i.e .",
    "_ with a faster expansion rate ) will be favored .",
    "in particular , if their expansion rate is sufficiently large , this can give a high statistical significance to realizations outside the reliability range having a very low significance according to the original distribution . in this situation , when the difference between the two distributions is very important , the form of @xmath121 obtained from the perturbed solution can not be trusted although @xmath122 is reliable .",
    "this means that , in most domains , the statistical properties of the field are correctly described by @xmath122 but that the universe is mainly made up of very big domains where @xmath122 can not be trusted .",
    "this is exactly what happens for lf models where the volume - weighted probability of finding the field in the confidence range ( dashed red line , right panel in fig .",
    "[ limits_chao ] ) is basically vanishing while the single - domain one ( solid blue line ) is large .",
    "therefore , in this case , the perturbative method does not allow us to reliably compute the volume - weighted distribution .",
    "+      we have also performed the same study for new inflation and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ limits_new ] .",
    "now , the reliability interval , still given by the uniformly colored ( grey ) region , is no longer determined only from @xmath75 but also from @xmath74 because , contrary to the lf case , @xmath74 does not vanish for sf . therefore , in this situation , one has to determine @xmath98 and @xmath97 from eqs .",
    "( [ consl ] ) and ( [ consr ] ) and not only from eq .",
    "( [ consr ] ) , as was the case for the lf models .",
    "the form of @xmath98 and @xmath97 as a function of @xmath10 is also more complicated and is no longer given by straight lines .",
    "it must be computed numerically . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ limits_new ] , the allowed region increases at the beginning of inflation , reaches a maximum extension and shrinks as the end of inflation is approached .",
    "the region @xmath115 without the volume effects is given by the hatched ( blue ) region , the lines having a positive slope .",
    "the region @xmath115 with the volume effects taken into account is represented by the hatched ( red ) region , the lines having a negative slope .",
    "when these regions are within the uniformly colored ( grey ) region , the approximation is reliable . as before , the border lines @xmath123 meet at the beginning of inflation where they vanish .",
    "the break down of the approximation , without the volume effect , is signaled by the vertical dotted - dashed ( blue ) line and , with the volume effects , by the dotted ( red ) line .",
    "one notices that the results for sf are basically similar to those that have been obtained in the chaotic model case , namely the approximation remains reliable until the very end of the inflationary phase .",
    "however , in the case of new inflation , one clearly sees the importance of using a carefully defined criterion to estimate the reliability of the approximation .",
    "as already mentioned , the naive criterion @xmath124 would have indicated that the approximation becomes untrustworthy very quickly after the beginning of inflation since we have initially @xmath125 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ limits_new ] that , on the contrary , the approximation is good during a large part of inflation . finally , the probability of being in the reliability region , computed with @xmath15 ( solid blue line ) or @xmath21 ( dashed red line ) is also displayed in fig .",
    "[ limits_new ] ( right panel ) . in the case of sf models ,",
    "the volume effects are less important and , as a consequence , the two probabilities are similar .",
    "the fact that the break down of the approximation occurs at the end of inflation only , at @xmath126 for the particular example studied here , is confirmed .",
    "a similar analysis can also be done for the running mass potential .",
    "the results for the two models under consideration are displayed in fig .",

    "all the conventions concerning the allowed regions , volume effects etc  are the same as before . in the case of the rm1 model ( upper panels ) , eq .   giving the constraint on @xmath74",
    "can be analytically solved to the lowest order in @xmath127 .",
    "this gives @xmath128 it turns out that this constraint is the dominating one at late times as can be checked in fig .",
    "[ limits_run ] ( left panel ) : the shape of the allowed region near the end of inflation is delimited by two straight lines .",
    "the constraint on @xmath75 has been solved numerically .",
    "the figure demonstrates , and this is also confirmed in the right panel , that the perturbative solution for rm1 is very good during almost all the inflationary phase and breaks down only at the very end of inflation .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the rm2 model , see the two bottom panels .",
    "finally , one notices that the two probabilities [ _ i.e .  _",
    "the ones obtained with @xmath122 and @xmath121 ] , and contrary to the lf case , do not dramatically differ from each other . in the case of the rm2 model",
    ", the reliability of the volume - weighted description can even be larger than the single - point one .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the new results obtained in this article .",
    "the main goal of the paper was to present a new method aimed at estimating the precision of the perturbative expansion studied in ref .",
    "this method is based on the use of the lagrange remainder . after having discussed the general features of this new approach ,",
    "we have applied it to the inflationary models studied in ref .",
    "we have proven that the approximate probability density functions derived in this reference are , in general , a very good approximations to the actual ones except , as expected , at the end of inflation .",
    "this conclusion holds even if the volume effects are taken into account except in the case of the large field models .",
    "we conclude that the perturbative expansion of the inflationary langevin equation together with the method presented here , besides being the only available method with a built - in measure of its domain of validity , form a robust formalism to efficiently compute the stochastic effects during inflation .",
