    "the dynamics of language has recently been identified as a rich field for interdisciplinary application of statistical techniques traditionally associated with mathematics and physics .",
    "a host of analytical and numerical models have been proposed , aimed at reproducing more or less quantitatively several aspects of language as a dynamical sociocultural entity.@xcite among them , models of language evolution focus on the joint processes of mutation of linguistic features and of language acquisition , switching , and adoption by human populations.@xcite    bit - string models of language evolution , prototyped by schulze s model,@xcite conceive that a language is completely characterized by a sequence of dichotomic properties .",
    "each of them represents , for instance , whether the language in question possesses certain grammatical property or not .",
    "the sequence is naturally represented as a string of binary variables ( bits ) , whose length is the number of yes / no questions which fully identify a language .",
    "emphasis in the study of bit - string language models has been put on agent - based numerical simulations,@xcite addressing possible explanations for the distribution of population among languages and the abundance of language families .",
    "the language spoken by an individual can mutate at a certain rate , and each individual can also abandon his / her language and adopt a different one copied from a randomly chosen member of the population . upon variation of the mutation rate ,",
    "simulations show a sharp transition between a state of dominance , where most of the population speaks the same language , and a situation where the population is homogeneously distributed among languages.@xcite    in this paper , i introduce a formulation of bit - string language models based on differential equations for the population fraction speaking each language .",
    "the evolution turns out to be a combination of replicator dynamics , representing language switching , and diffusion in the bit - string ( hypercubic ) space , representing mutation .",
    "while the stability of the homogeneous state can be exactly analyzed , the study of the dominance state requires a mean - field - like approximation .",
    "the results , nevertheless , are in very good agreement with numerical resolution of the differential equations and with agent - based simulations .",
    "they predict a region of bistability , where dominance and homogeneity coexist as possible asymptotic states of the system , and the disappearance of the dominance state through a tangent bifurcation .",
    "the present formulation provides an alternative to simulations to trace language progress and regression in the framework of bit - string models .",
    "as advanced in the introduction , in bit - string models an individual language is represented by a string of @xmath0 binary variables ( bits ) , each of them adopting one of two possible values , say , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the total number of possible languages is @xmath3 .",
    "evolution is driven by two dynamical rules .",
    "first , the language of an individual can mutate with a certain probability per time unit .",
    "each mutation event consists of a change in a single , randomly selected bit of the individual s language , from @xmath1 to @xmath2 or _",
    "vice versa_. second , an individual can give up his / her language and adopt a new one . to account for the preference for more widespread languages , the new one is chosen by selecting an individual at random from the whole population and adopting his / her language . in this way",
    ", the probability of switching to a given language ( say , to language @xmath4 ) equals the fraction of the population speaking @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the probability of abandoning the original language ( say , language @xmath6 ) is weighted by a monotonically decreasing function @xmath7 of the fraction of the population speaking @xmath6 .",
    "a language is thus less likely to be given up if it is spoken by a large fraction of the total population .",
    "previous numerical analyses of bit - string models have considered the cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , both of which satisfy @xmath10 and @xmath11.@xcite    bit - string models are added with population dynamics , for instance , asexual reproduction with births at a given rate , and deaths with a mortality rate proportional to the population size .",
    "this insures that after a transient , and up to small fluctuations the total population remains constant in time .",
    "a newborn inherits the language of the parent , except possibly for mutation or switching to a new language , following essentially the same rules as described above .",
    "the effect of births on language evolution , thus , is effectively the same as mutation and switching by `` adult '' individuals .    in its original formulation,@xcite schulze s model",
    "considers that the features of a given ( `` superior '' ) language may be preferred to those of any other language . during mutation events , with a certain probability , a bit copies the value of the homologous bit in the `` superior '' language , enhancing the possibility that this language is eventually spoken by most of the population .",
    "here , i disregard this mechanism and assume that all languages are intrinsically equivalent .    the dynamical rules of bit - string language models can be readily expressed as differential equations for the fractions @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the population speaking each language , which satisfy the normalization condition @xmath14 at all times .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , i will assume that the total population remains exactly constant in time , incorporating newborn language s mutation and switching to the respective overall mechanisms .",
    "the contribution of mutation to the time variation of @xmath5 consists of a gain term proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 if languages @xmath4 and @xmath6 differ by just one bit , and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "the sum runs over all the languages .",
    "the gain term represents the fraction of the population speaking any language @xmath6 which mutates to language @xmath4 in a time unit .",
    "the factor @xmath18 accounts for the fact that a mutation event can lead , with identical probability , from each language @xmath6 to @xmath0 different languages .",
    "correspondingly , there is a loss term proportional to @xmath19 , which represents mutations of language @xmath4 to other languages . in turn",
    ", the gain term associated to the mechanism of language switching is proportional to @xmath20 , because the probability of abandoning @xmath6 is @xmath7 , and the probability of adopting @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding loss term is proportional to @xmath21 .    if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the rates of mutation and switching events , the evolution of the fraction @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) is given by @xmath25 summing these equations over the index @xmath4 yields @xmath26 , which insures that eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) holds if the initial fraction satisfy normalization . the functions @xmath27 make the equations nonlinear , so that little can be expected from trying to solve them exactly .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that a joint dynamical description of mutation and population growth here corresponding to switching to widespread languages has been proposed for the process of language learning and the evolution of universal grammar.@xcite several exact results are known for the relevant equations,@xcite though they depend crucially on the fact that the functions which play a role analogous to that of @xmath28 are linear on the population fractions .    also , it is important to realize that the representation of languages as bit strings is essentially irrelevant to the form of the evolution equation ( [ fund ] ) .",
    "as long as each language is interpreted as a kind of _ state _ to which a certain fraction of the population is assigned at each time , the specific way in which such states are individualized does not play a role in the equation . at most ,",
    "it is necessary that those states are suitably labeled , in such a way as to discern the languages between which population can be transferred due to mutations , i.e. as to fix de coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise , the mathematical form of the equations will be the same irrespectively of the individual characterization of languages .",
    "though , for clarity , i discuss eq .",
    "( [ fund ] ) with reference to bit - string models , it is important to bear in mind that most results will also hold for other models driven by the mechanisms of mutation and switching .",
    "the contributions of mutation and switching to the evolution of @xmath5 have opposite , competing effects .",
    "while mutation spreads individuals over different languages , switching tends to concentrate the population on languages with an already large number of speakers .",
    "it is useful to begin with a separate analysis of the two mechanisms , which are closely related to well - understood processes in other areas of science .",
    "then , one can proceed to show that the combination of the two competing mechanisms gives rise to a critical transition between language diversity and dominance , as effectively observed to occur in numerical simulations of bit - string models.@xcite",
    "in order to isolate from each other the effects of mutation and switching , let us first disregard the latter , setting @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ fund ] ) . taking into account that @xmath31 , the dynamics without switching is governed by the equations @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "this expression emphasizes the fact that mutation is a form of linear diffusion , with population transfer between languages at a rate proportional to the population difference @xmath34 .",
    "the diffusion process takes place on the set of bit strings of length @xmath0 , which can be assimilated to the vertices of the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube of unitary side .",
    "mutation events transfer population between languages which differ in a single bit , i.e. between hypercube vertices at hamming distance @xmath35 .",
    "each vertex has @xmath0 neighbour vertices at @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath16 if the hamming distance between @xmath4 and @xmath6 equals one , and @xmath17 otherwise , one has @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , introducing the hypercube adjacency matrix @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ dif1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the identity matrix .",
    "the solution to the linear equation ( [ dif2 ] ) can be found by standard methods , in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath42 and eigenvectors @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "one of the eigenvalues of @xmath45 , say @xmath46 , equals zero , and all the remaining eigenvalues are negative .",
    "consequently , the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , yields the equilibrium solution which , due to the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) , is @xmath48 for all @xmath4 . in other words , starting from any initial condition , the system asymptotically reaches a homogeneous state . in the context of the original problem , in the absence of language switching",
    ", mutation leads for long times to a state where the population is homogeneously distributed among all possible languages .      if , now , @xmath49 so that mutation is absent , eq .",
    "( [ fund ] ) becomes a member of a well - studied class of nonlinear equations , generally written as @xmath50 @xmath33 , with @xmath51 .",
    "equations ( [ replic ] ) define the so - called replicator dynamics.@xcite they describe the evolution of a system of interacting species in terms of the fractions @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of individuals of species @xmath4 and @xmath54 is the total population in the system . the function @xmath55 is the reproductive rate , or ( fisherian @xcite ) fitness , of species @xmath4 .",

    "this kind of feedback effect will be enhanced as time elapses . if , on the other hand , @xmath66 , the ratio @xmath65 will monotonically decrease along the evolution .",
    "since the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) holds , this result suggests that , generically , the language which initially has the largest population fraction , say language @xmath4 , will asymptotically accumulate the whole population , @xmath67 as @xmath68 , while the fractions of all the other languages will asymptotically vanish .",

    ", however , this equilibrium solution corresponds to an extremely special initial condition , where all the initial populations are identical . as a matter of fact , all the equilibria with @xmath83 , where more than one language survives asymptotically , are rather special , since they require that two or more populations are initially identical .",

    "however , the overall pictures are qualitatively identical .",
    "in this paper , i have presented a formulation of bit - string models of language evolution based on differential equations for the fraction of the population speaking each language .",
    "the formulation highlights the fact that these models conceive language evolution as combining a diffusion mechanism , given by mutation between similar languages , with replicator dynamics for language switching , when an individual adopts the language of a randomly selected member of the population . the combination of replicator dynamics and diffusion is not new in the literature of biological evolution models .",
    "in contrast with bit - string language models , however , these applications to biological evolution often assume that the fitness of individuals of each species is independent of the population , though it varies between species.@xcite in bit - string models , on the other hand , the dependence of the unfitness on the population fraction is essential to represent preference for more widespread languages .",
    "the decrease of the unfitness of a language when its population grows is the key ingredient which shapes the behaviour of bit - string models . in particular , the occurrence of a tangent bifurcation where the dominance state with most of the population speaking the same language disappears , and the existence of a parameter region where dominance and homogeneity coexist and are stable , are direct consequences of such dependence .",
    "this bistability opens the possibility that , in a system of languages divided into weakly - interacting domains , where inter - domain switching is much less likely than intra - domain transitions , some domains converge to the dominance state while others approach homogeneity , even when the evolution parameters are identical all over the system .",
    "it is worth remarking that a dominance - homogeneity transition is known to happen in genetic space within replication - mutation models of molecular evolution , specifically , in eigen s model.@xcite though the involved critical phenomenon is mathematically different from the tangent bifurcation disclosed here , they are qualitatively much the same from the viewpoint of the competing balance between the basic mechanisms at work .",
    "it would be interesting , by inspiration from mathematical studies of biological evolution , to add bit - string models with some non - uniformity in the individual properties of languages , for instance , assigning different parameters to the unfitness function of each language .",
    "in fact , it may well be that the preference for a very widespread language is inhibited by intrinsic difficulties to acquire it .",
    "_ vice versa _ , a language whose acquisition is perceivably easier could be chosen as a common communication means by populations speaking more widespread but more intricate languages .",
    "do you imagine the whole of mankind eventually deciding to speak mandarin and its dialects?@xcite think also of mark twain s `` the horrors of the german language.''@xcite    let me finally point out that comparison of numerical results from bit - string models and empirical data of language statistics specifically , the distribution of language sizes , and the abundance within language families has been focused on transient stages of the evolutionary process . in agreement with this , though not analyzed in detail here , the present study shows that asymptotic states in bit - string models are not a good representation of empirical observations .",
    "transient effects in the present formulation could be addressed by numerical resolution of eqs .",
