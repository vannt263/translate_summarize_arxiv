    "black holes are exotic objects in the theory of classical and quantum gravity .",
    "even more surprising is their connection with the laws of standard thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "since black hole thermodynamics is expected to play a role in any meaningful theory of gravity , therefore it will be a natural question to ask whether the thermodynamic properties of black holes are modified if higher dimensional corrections are incorporated in the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "one can expect a similar situation to appear in an effective theory of quantum gravity , such as string theory .",
    "thermodynamics of black holes in higher dimensional ads space has been a fascinating topic of research since the discovery of a phase transition by hawking and page in @xmath1 dimensional schwarzschild ads background @xcite . since then , a large number of investigations have been focused on the question of thermodynamic properties in higher dimensional anti de sitter space time @xcite-@xcite . however",

    "an attempt along this direction has been commenced recently @xcite-@xcite , where different black holes in ads space were considered .",

    "we adopt a gibbsian approach in the grand canonical frame work to discuss the thermodynamics of phase transition in arbitrary @xmath0 dimensional rn ads and schwarzschild ads black holes .",
    "this phase transition is characterized by a discontinuity of specific heat , compressibility and volume expansivity at the critical point .",
    "our analysis clearly reveals that such a transition takes place between a black hole with smaller mass ( phase 1 ) to a black hole with larger mass ( phase 2 ) .",
    "the specific heat corresponding to phase 1 is negative , while it is positive for phase 2 .",
    "therefore this phase transition is essentially a transition between a thermodynamically unstable phase to a thermodynamically stable one .",
    "explicit expressions for the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) and critical mass ( @xmath3 ) ( segregating large from small mass black holes ) are determined .",
    "we also study the nature of this phase transition using ehrenfest s scheme of standard thermodynamics .",
    "our analysis reveals the fact that such transitions are indeed second order equilibrium transitions . in order to do that we analytically check both the ehrenfest s equations at the critical point .",
    "it is to be noted that in spite of infinite divergences of all the relevant thermodynamic quantities ( e.g ; specific heat , volume expansion coefficient and compressibility ) near critical point , we have been able to carry out our analysis .",
    "it is important to point out the difference between the phase transition we study in this paper with the conventional hawking - page phase transition .",
    "our analysis is strictly confined to the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) where the specific heat ( @xmath4 ) acquires an infinite divergence . on the other hand hawking - page transition occurs at a temperature @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) where gibbs free energy ( @xmath7 ) changes its sign @xcite-@xcite . from our analysis",

    "it is clear that such a transition takes place from a black hole with smaller mass ( @xmath52 ) to a black hole with larger mass ( @xmath53 ) , where @xmath3 denotes the critical mass .",
    "also , we have found that the black hole with smaller mass falls in an unstable phase since it has negative specific heat , whereas that with the larger mass possesses a positive specific heat and thereby corresponds to a stable phase .",
    "we have provided completely generalized expressions for the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) and critical mass ( @xmath3 ) that characterize this phase transition .",
    "also , we have explicitly calculated the temperature @xmath5 ( @xmath118 ) which is associated with the change in sign in gibb s free energy ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "following our approach , we have established a universal relation ( [ univ ] ) between @xmath2 and @xmath5 that is valid in any arbitrary dimension ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "employing ehrenfest s scheme we have resolved the vexing issue regarding the nature of phase transition in reissner nordstrom ads black holes . in order to do that we have analytically checked the validity of both the ehrenfest s equations near the critical point .",
    "this clearly suggests that the phase transition that is associated with the divergence in the heat capacity at the critical point ( @xmath2 ) is indeed a second order equilibrium transition .",
    "although there have been a number of investigations @xcite-@xcite in order to analyze the phase transition phenomena in higher dimensional ( charged ) ads black holes , most of these are confined to the canonical ensemble .",
    "a detailed study based on a grand canonical frame work was lacking .",
    "moreover , explicit expressions for the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) and/or critical mass ( @xmath3 ) , were in general , unavailable .",
    "our analysis reveals an important distinction between the thermodynamics of black holes and that of usual systems . while most discussions in the canonical ensemble @xcite-@xcite point to a first order phase transition we obtain a second order transition in the grand canonical frame work .",
    "thus , contrary to usual thermodynamics , the nature of the phase transition appears to depend on the specific ensemble .",
