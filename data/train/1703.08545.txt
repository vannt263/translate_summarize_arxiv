    "the theoretical proposal @xcite and experimental discovery @xcite of weyl semimetals have opened up a new research field called topological semimetals@xcite . due to the topologically nontrivial structure of wavefunctions , near a positive weyl point , the electronic spin polarizations take on an `` all - out '' configuration , making the weyl point a magnetic monopole in momentum space . physically , the essence of topological band theory , that the bloch wavefunction on a closed surface in momentum space can have nontrivial topological structures , is independent of the statistics of the constituent particles @xcite . by replacing the electronic spin polarization in the above example by light polarization , for instance ,",
    "one obtains a topological band crossing in photonic crystals .",
    "such ideas of generalization have inspired researchers to find topologically nontrivial band crossings in boson systems of photons @xcite , phonons@xcite and magnons@xcite .",
    "most topological band crossings studied so far are protected by lattice symmetries : weyl points by ( lattice ) translation symmetry , dirac points by translation and point - group or nonsymmorphic symmetries @xcite , and other exotic band degeneracies at brillouin - zone boundary @xcite by certain space group symmetries .",
    "an ( almost ) full classification of these band crossings has appeared in the literature @xcite . in this paper , we focus on a new type of symmetry groups : the magnetic groups , which naturally rise in magnetically ordered systems .",
    "the difference between a magnetic group and a space group is that in addition to lattice symmetries , the former generically contains elements of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some space - group operation and @xmath4 time - reversal @xcite .",
    "band crossings protected by magnetic groups can presumably be found in the electronic band structures in magnetic materials , as well as the band structure of magnons ( coherent spin excitations ) over a magnetic ground state .    in this paper , we choose for our study one of the simplest magnetic groups , generated by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is spatial inversion .",
    "this magnetic group pertains to various antiferromagnets with centro - symmetric crystal lattices , where two spins related by inversion have opposite polarizations in the ordered state .",
    "in addition , we require that the ordered moments are collinear , introducing a global u(1 ) spin - rotation symmetry along the ordered moments . then , if the spin interactions are either fully isotropic such as heisenberg [ with su(2 ) spin - rotation symmetry ] , or have an easy axis [ with u(1 ) spin - rotation symmetry ] , we show that dirac points are protected in the band structure of the magnons .",
    "the excitations near such dirac points in the magnon bands are hence called dirac magnons .",
    "different from all known types of dirac points , these dirac points are _ not _ pinned to any high - symmetry points @xcite , lines @xcite or planes , but can appear at generic momenta in the magnetic brillouin zone . on the surface , in the region near the projection of a dirac point in the surface brillouin zone , there are topological surface states , whose dispersion takes on the shape of a `` double - helicoid '' @xcite , and the equal energy contours are `` double arcs '' @xcite connecting the projections of two dirac points .",
    "furthermore , we find that when the u(1 ) symmetry is broken ( _ e.g. _ , by dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions @xcite or other anisotropic effects ) , but @xmath5 still preserved , each dirac point _",
    "necessarily _ breaks into a nodal ring . in ref .",
    "[ ] , it was proved that nodal lines protected by @xmath7 can be divided into two types , both protected by the @xmath8-berry phase@xcite , but are distinguished by the presence ( absence ) of the @xmath9-monopole charge , and the second latter type have not been predicted in realistic materials@xcite .",
    "here we prove that every nodal ring broken from a dirac point upon u(1)-symmetry breaking has nontrivial @xmath9-charge .",
    "to be concrete , we apply the general theory to a three - dimensional spin - web compound , cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 , which develops long - range collinear antiferromagnetic order below @xmath10 k. we use a @xmath11-@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) heisenberg model to simulate the spin interactions and calculate the magnon band structure using linear - spin - wave approximation , where eight pairs of dirac points are identified between two optical magnon branches .",
    "surface states on the @xmath14- and @xmath15-planes are simulated and in both cases we find equal energy contours take the form of `` double - arcs '' connecting the projections of the dirac points .",
    "experiments for detecting key features of dirac and nodal line magnons are proposed .",
    "we begin by noting that when the total @xmath16 is preserved , all single - particle excitations can be labeled by their spin quantum numbers . for magnons , these numbers are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and magnons with opposite spins are decoupled .",
    "next we look at how the magnetic - group symmetry @xmath5 acts on the magnons .",
    "physically , parity ( spatial - inversion ) preserves spin and time - reversal reverses it , making the composite symmetry @xmath5 invert the spin quantum number of a magnon .",
    "based on these observations , we see that the single - particle hamiltonian decouples into two sectors , one for each spin quantum number , or symbolically @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hamiltonian for the spin-@xmath21 sector in the spin system . magnetic group symmetry",
    "@xmath5 then requires @xmath22 there is no further constraint on the form of @xmath23 except that it is hermitian .",
    "when @xmath23 is defined in three - dimensional brillouin zone , there can be weyl points in the spectrum as band crossings@xcite .",
    "due to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , @xmath24 and @xmath23 have the same band structure and therefore when weyl points appear in @xmath23 , there must be weyl points in @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath5 reverses the berry curvature while preserving the momentum , it reverses the monopole charge of a weyl point . in the end , for each weyl point in @xmath23 , there is an equal and opposite weyl point in @xmath24 at the same momentum , and they together make a dirac point .    below are some basic properties of these dirac points in the bulk .",
    "( i ) the weyl points in @xmath23 are not pinned to any high - symmetry point , line or plane , so the dirac point may appear at any momentum in the brillouin zone , in contrast to previously studied dirac points that are pinned to high - symmetry points and lines .",
    "( ii ) since the weyl points in @xmath23 must appear in pairs , so do the dirac points .",
    "( iii ) upon @xmath5-symmetry breaking a dirac point splits into two weyl points , because in this case @xmath25 .",
    "( iv ) for each dirac point we can define a monopole charge that equals the monopole charge of the weyl point in @xmath23 , and two dirac points with opposite monopole charges `` annihilate '' each other when they meet in the brillouin zone , creating a gap .    due to the bulk - edge correspondence , the topological nature of a bulk node",
    "is also manifested on the surface .",
    "for example , a weyl point in the bulk corresponds to helicoid surface states near the projection of the bulk node in the surface brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "a dirac point , considered as a superposition of two opposite weyl points from @xmath20 respectively , then corresponds to double - helicoid surface states@xcite . due to @xmath5 ,",
    "the dispersions on opposite surfaces are identical .    in realistic magnetic materials , besides the isotropic heisenberg terms , other terms , such as site - dependent single - ion anisotropy , exchange anisotropy and dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction , break the u(1 ) spin - rotation symmetry , but will leave the space - time symmetry @xmath5 intact .",
    "for example , when the bonds connecting two magnetic atoms to the ligand atom make an angle less than 180@xmath26 , dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction is in general present .",
    "when u(1 ) symmetry is broken , a dirac point is no longer stable , and as long as @xmath5 is still preserved , weyl points are disallowed @xcite , so in principle a dirac point can either be fully gapped or broken into a nodal ring . further analysis rules out the former possibility , and shows that each dirac point becomes a nodal ring upon turning on these anisotropic perturbations , where the two bands cross along a one - dimensional closed line .    to see this , we first notice that the spin - lattice coupling does not break the magnetic - group symmetry @xmath5 , and that in any spin system @xmath27 . in an earlier theoretical work ,",
    "one of us showed that in the presence of @xmath5 with @xmath27 , the generic band crossing is a nodal ring , which may or may not carry a @xmath9 monopole charge  a topological index defined on a sphere enclosing the ring .",
    "when a nodal ring carries ( does not carry ) a @xmath9 monopole charge , the ring can not ( can ) continuously shrink to a point and disappear . to compute this @xmath9 charge , we notice that near the dirac point , the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath28 ) is generally given by , up to a gauge @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the @xmath9-index of this hamiltonian is found to be nontrivial , _",
    "i. e. _ , the dirac point is only a special case of a nodal ring when u(1)-symmetry is broken . to our best knowledge , while nodal rings without @xmath9 monopole charge have been proposed in many fermionic and bosonic systems@xcite",
    ", nodal rings carrying nontrivial @xmath9 monopole charge have not yet been predicted in realistic materials .",

    "nearest neighbors are connected by solid lines and their spins are antiparallel .",
    "next - nearest neighbors are connected by dotted lines ( only one is shown ) .",
    "star symbol indicates inversion center.,width=302 ]    three - dimensional collinear antiferromagnets are the best platform for us to realize these topological band crossings in @xmath32-space and here we have chosen cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 , which was recently reported to host a novel spin lattice @xcite , dubbed a three - dimensional spin web @xcite .",
    "the lattice consists of almost planar cu@xmath33 hexagons that are perpendicular to one of the four space diagonals of the cubic unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) , featuring a hybrid between a 3d spin-1/2 network and a low connectivity of the superexchange pathways : each cu@xmath33 ion is shared by two hexagons and has only four nearest neighbors . below @xmath34 k , the system develops long - range antiferromagnetic order that leaves clear signatures in magnetic susceptibility and neutron diffraction measurements @xcite . without loss of generality ,",
    "we believe that the large yet highly symmetric magnetic unit cell of cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 is favorable for symmetry - protected magnon band crossings in the bulk that inevitably lead to interesting surface states .",
    "furthermore , we note that the lattice structure of cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 is very similar to those of @xmath35-type sesquioxides @xmath36o@xmath0 ( @xmath37 y , sc , in , or rare - earth elements ) @xcite .",
    "the spin lattice of cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 can be realized in the latter , if the wyckoff 24@xmath38 and 8@xmath39 sites can be occupied by magnetic and non - magnetic ions , respectively . given the rather broad distribution of the @xmath40 ionic radii , ranging from 81 pm ( sc and in ) to 106 pm ( la ) , it might be possible to synthesize solid solutions of them , such as nd@xmath0sco@xmath1 , with minimal inter - site disorder @xcite .",
    "along with the rich magnetic properties of rare - earth elements , this renders our analysis of cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 potentially applicable to a large family of interesting magnetic materials .",
    "available neutron diffraction data are consistent with a collinear antiferromagnetic spin configuration plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] , though a slightly noncolinear configuration can not be completely ruled out @xcite .",
    "this ground state is mostly easily understood by assuming the unfrustrated nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange interaction @xmath41 . yet , due to the geometric configuration of the atoms , the next - nearest - neighbor exchange may also have an appreciable magnitude , whose sign is likely to be also positive ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "we thus model the spin interactions in cu@xmath0teo@xmath1 using the following @xmath11-@xmath12 heisenberg model @xmath42 the classical ground state of @xmath43 depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and when @xmath44 , the ground state configuration matches the experimental one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "it is easy to check that this spin configuration preserves both @xmath5 and @xmath16 , and hence it may host dirac magnons .",
    "the strongly localized moment , and the relatively small quantum fluctuation in three dimensions allow us to treat the magnon excitations using the linear spin - wave approximation .    , where the inset shows a zoomed - in region near p. ( b ) positions of all dirac points in the first brillouin zone and their projections onto the @xmath14- and @xmath15-surface brillouin zones .",
    "red and blue colors indicate the monopole charge of + 1 and -1 , respectively . for clarity , only one of the eight w@xmath0 points",
    "is displayed in the three - dimensional brillouin zone in ( b).,width=321 ]    there are twelve spins in each primary cell , with six pointing downward and six upward in the ground state .",
    "( note that the magnetic order does not enlarge the lattice unit cell . )",
    "we perform the standard holstein - primakoff transformation on the up spins @xmath45 and down spins @xmath46 we remark that under spin rotation along @xmath47-axis through @xmath48 , spin wave operator @xmath39 transforms as @xmath49 on up spins and @xmath50 on down spins , making them @xmath51 and @xmath18 operators , respectively .",
    "all spin - wave operators can thus be divided into two sets by their spins : @xmath52 having @xmath51 and @xmath53 having @xmath54 . as long as the u(1 )",
    "symmetry is present , these two sets do not couple to each other in a quadratic spin wave hamiltonian .    for @xmath55 ( but see appendix [ sec : otherj2 ] for other values of @xmath12 ) , the magnon bands along high - symmetry lines in the brillouin zone are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) .",
    "distinct linear band crossings can be found between two optical branches ( marked blue and red ) .",
    "calculation of the monopole charge using the wilson loop technique confirms that all these band crossings are dirac points defined in this paper : there are six positive dirac points along @xmath56h and its symmetry equivalents ( denoted by @xmath57 ) , two negative dirac points at two p s ( @xmath58 ) and eight negative weyl points along @xmath56p and its symmetry equivalents ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "more detailed search shows that there is no other band crossing between the two branches .",
    "we remark that the limited experimental data in the literature on this compound can not fully justify the @xmath11-@xmath12 model ( or any spin model ) , so that some dirac points may appear away from the positions predicted in our calculation .",
    "nonetheless , we emphasize that the high - symmetry point p ( @xmath58 ) is _ always _ a dirac point as long as the symmetries are preserved .",
    "this _ model independent _ dirac point deserves some detailed analysis given below . the three screw rotations @xmath60 and @xmath5 are elements of the little group at p. it is straightforward to check that @xmath61=\\pm2i\\epsilon_{ijk}r_k,\\ ] ] forming an su(2 ) group , where the lowest dimension of irreducible representations is two . on the other hand , @xmath5 requires that all @xmath62 are real , which is incompatible with the two dimensional representation , since @xmath63 are purely imaginary .",
    "therefore the lowest irreducible representation is four dimensional , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . above is the formal proof that p must be a dirac point as long as two twofold screw axes and @xmath5 are preserved .",
    "due to the widely acknowledged bulk - edge correspondence principle , bulk topological states in @xmath38-dimensions have anomalous surface states that can not be realized on a @xmath66-dimensional lattice without breaking certain symmetries . for topological band crossings ,",
    "the surface bands form a helicoid structure surrounding the projection of the bulk node . to be specific , if two bulk bands cross each other at a dirac point , then in the surface brillouin zone , inside the gap between the two bands , there are surface states , and the dispersion of the surface states form a double - helicoid ( two helicoids winding in different directions ) centered at the projection of the dirac point . as stated in ref .",
    "[ ] , the equal energy contours of a double - helicoid are two arcs emanating from the dirac point projection , ending at the projection of another dirac point of opposite charge .     on the @xmath14- and the @xmath15-surface at @xmath67 in ( a ,",

    "the surface brillouin zones are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](b ) by projecting the bulk brillouin zone .",
    "the dirac points are also projected onto the surface brillouin zone and there are instances when two dirac points in the bulk brillouin zone project to the same point on the surface .",
    "we set the parameters to @xmath55 such that @xmath70 are close in energy .",
    "then we choose an energy @xmath71 that is the average energy of @xmath72 and plot the equal energy contours in the surface brillouin zone . for clarity",
    ", we separately plot the contribution from @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] . in a spin - unpolarized experiment",
    ", the two patterns ( upper and lower ) should be superimposed .",
    "we see that the projection of each positive dirac point is connected to that of a negative dirac point by an arc and vice versa ; and the projection of two positive dirac points is connected to the two projections of negative dirac points and vice versa .",
    "since the positive and negative dirac points are set far apart in the brillouin zone , the arcs connecting their projections are long , a desirable feature for experimental observation .",
    "additionally , we note that due to the symmetry @xmath5 , the two opposite surfaces have identical dispersions of the surface states .",
    "finally , we remark on possible experiments that will be able to justify our assumptions and testify our predictions",
    ". the actual symmetry and configuration of the ordered phase may be better confirmed than was done using powder sample by performing elastic neutron scattering on single crystals @xcite .",
    "the dirac points as well as nodal lines in the bulk can be directly measured with inelastic neutron scattering , and they are further expected to exhibit gap - opening behaviors in a magnetic field . since magnons of each spin form many weyl points , there are thermal hall currents for each spin component . however , because the total hall current of magnons must vanish due to @xmath5 , a spin - resolved measurement of the magnon currents is required to observe this effect .",
    "the arcs states , however interesting , are expected to be difficult to directly observe by inelastic neutron scattering due to the very small sample volume from the surfaces .",
    "one may be able to detect these states using surface - sensitive probes , such as high - resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy , or helium atom energy loss spectrascopy .    a    40ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevx.5.031013 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat4788 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.100.013904 [ * * ,   ( ) ]",
