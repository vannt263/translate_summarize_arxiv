    "it is immediately seen that the projective lines @xmath8 are leaves of the one - dimensional foliation induced by ( [ sh ] ) on @xmath9 . on each leaf",
    "@xmath10 the foliation has four singular points defined by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a point on @xmath10 and consider a germ of a cross - section @xmath13 to @xmath10 at @xmath14 .",
    "the holonomy group @xmath15 at infinity is then the image of the holonomy representation @xmath16 it is defined up to a conjugation by a diffeomorphism , depending on the germ of cross - section and the initial point @xmath14 .",
    "our main result is    [ main ] the holonomy group at infinity of the sixth painlev equation is virtually commutative .",
    "recall that a group @xmath15 is said to be virtually commutative , provided that there is a normal commutative subgroup @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 is finite .",
    "the isomorphism class of the holonomy group @xmath15 along the leaf @xmath10 has in fact a canonical meaning . as we shall see in section [ compactification",
    "] , the leaf @xmath10 coincides with the divisor @xmath19 in the okamoto compactification@xcite of the phase space of @xmath20 , see fig.[fig2 ] . in particular , the holonomy group along @xmath10 is isomorphic to the holonomy group along the okamoto divisor @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining divisors shown on fig.[fig2 ] are topological cylinders , the associated holonomy has therefore one generator and is commutative .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] is based on lemma [ mainlemma2 ] which claims that the local holonomies near the singular points of the leaf @xmath10 are involutions , as well on the algebraic lemma [ mainlemma ] .",
    "lemma [ mainlemma2 ] and lemma [ mainlemma ] suggest that theorem [ main ] is related to the fact that the vertical divisor shown on fig.[fig2 ] belongs to the kodaira list of degenerate elliptic curves .",
    "let @xmath21 be the @xmath22-th order variational equation along @xmath10 and @xmath23 the associated differential galois group .",
    "@xmath21 defines a connection on the riemann sphere @xmath24 with four regular singular points at the punctures @xmath25 .",
    "the monodromy group of @xmath21 represents the @xmath22-th order jet of the holonomy group along @xmath19 .",
    "we describe these monodromy groups in the simplest cases @xmath26 in section [ higher ] .",
    "it follows , for instance , that the monodromy group of @xmath27 is isomorphic to a semi direct product @xmath28 , while @xmath29 .",
    "in particular @xmath30 , as well @xmath31 , are virtually commutative .",
    "this is a particular case of a general fact . according to theorem [ main ] the monodromy group of @xmath21 is virtually commutative for all @xmath22 .",
    "as its zarisky closure is @xmath23 , then we also have    [ main2 ] for every @xmath22 the differential galois group @xmath23 is virtually commutative .",
    "the present paper was motivated by the study of the liouville non - integrability of the @xmath20 system through the ziglin - morales - ramis - simo theory of non - integrability @xcite .",
    "this theory asserts that integrability in a liouville sense along a particular solution @xmath10 implies that the variational equation @xmath27 , as well all higher order variational equations @xmath21 along this solution , have virtually commutative differential galois groups .",
    "indeed , in such a way the `` semi - local '' non - integrability in a neighborhood of some particular solutions and parameter values of the @xmath20 system has been recently proved by horozov and stoyanova @xcite , see also morales - ruiz @xcite . to prove the non - integrability for all parameters we need , however , an explicitly known particular solution which exists for all parameter values .",
    "the only such appropriate solution is the vertical divisor @xmath32 , defined in theorem [ main ] .",
    "the result of theorem [ main2 ] shows that , contrary to what we expected , one can not prove the absence of a first integral of the @xmath20 equation , by making use of the ziglin - morales - ramis - simo theory .",
    "it is an open question , whether the @xmath20 equation has a first integral , meromorphic along the divisor @xmath10 `` at infinity '' .",
    "this question , but in a more general setting , has been raised in @xcite .",
    "non - integrability or transcendency of solutions is one of the central subjects in the study of the @xmath20 equation .",
    "the fact that its general solution can not be reduced to a solution of a first order differential equation has been claimed already by painlev , and proved more recently by watanabe @xcite and others .",
    "a different approach to the transcendency , going back to drach and vessiot , is to interpret it as an irreducibility of the galois groupoid defined by malgrange , see @xcite .",
    "the irreducibility of the @xmath20 equation in the sense of drach - vessiot - malgrange has been shown by cantat and loray ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) .",
    "it follows from these results that the @xmath20 equation does not allow an additional rational first integral .",
    "the relation between the irreducibility of the galois groupoid of a hamiltonian system and the differential galois group along a given algebraic solution is studied recently by casale @xcite . in this context ,",
    "our theorem [ main ] comes at a first sight as a surprise .",
    "the solution @xmath10 which we use is however rather special : it is an irreducible component of the anti - canonical divisor of the space of initial conditions , and hence it is invariant under the action of the galois groupoid .",
    "this leads to special properties of the galois groupoid along @xmath10 too .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ compactification ] ,",
    "we resume briefly the okamoto compactification of the phase space of @xmath20 equation @xcite . in section",
    "[ higher ] we describe the monodromy group of the first and the second variational equation along @xmath10 , in terms of complete elliptic integrals of first and second kind .",

    "we conclude that when @xmath290 and belongs to a suitable neighborhood of the point @xmath265 , then the foliation ( [ 2prime ] ) is transverse to the fibers of the map @xmath46 , and hence the path @xmath45 can be lifted until its lift reaches the border of @xmath284 . in the case",
    "when @xmath291 , this means that the path can be lifted until the cone - like domain @xmath252 which is filled up by holomorphic curves ( leaves of the foliation ) .",
    "therefore the path can be further lifted until the origin and the claim is proved .",
    "it remains to show that in the course of the lifting @xmath291 holds true .",

    "the monodromy of the puiseaux series @xmath296 , when @xmath297 makes one turn around the origin is easily described : it is an involution .",
    "this follows geometrically from the fact , that the divisor @xmath298 is obtained after two blow up s from @xmath261 .",
    "analytically , this means that if @xmath299 is a local coordinate on the projective line @xmath256 , then @xmath252 is an union of holomorphic curves ( leaves ) parameterized by @xmath299 and @xmath56 , such that for fixed @xmath300 we have @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the coordinate of @xmath303 and @xmath304 is the intersection point of the leaf and @xmath256 .",
    "therefore @xmath305 is an analytic function in @xmath306 and the result follows .",
