    "after the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite , the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field becomes more important .",
    "actually , apart from the electroweak symmetry breaking , the universe may have experienced several phase transitions such as the peccei - quinn ( pq ) phase transition  @xcite , grand unified theory ( gut ) phase transition and so on .",
    "most of these phase transitions are thought to be associated with vevs corresponding scalar fields , @xmath4 .",
    "while the concept is simple , the dynamics of the scalar fields leading to the symmetry breaking might be rather complicated and may have significant cosmological implications .",
    "the usual argument is as follows  @xcite . at high temperature",
    ", @xmath4 sits at the origin @xmath5 due to thermal effective potential since it is an enhanced symmetry point .",
    "as the temperature decreases , thermal effects become less significant , and finally @xmath4 relaxes to the minimum .",
    "however , the assumption that @xmath4 starts at the point @xmath6 may not always be justified , because @xmath4 can have very large initial value during and just after inflation .",
    "then we need to study dynamics of a scalar in order to see whether or not the symmetry is restored ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) in the early universe .",
    "if the initial amplitude of the scalar field is displaced from the minimum of the potential , the subsequent dynamics of the scalar field is non - trivial .",
    "with such an initial condition , the scalar field oscillates and dissipates its energy via the interaction with background .",
    "if the effect of the cosmic expansion is negligible , the scalar field eventually relaxes to an equilibrium state , which is determined by the initial energy ( and other conserved quantities ) .",
    "in such a case , the scalar field is expected to be trapped at the enhanced symmetry point if the temperature of the equilibrium state is higher than the critical temperature for the phase transition . on the contrary , if the cosmic expansion alone efficiently reduces the energy of oscillating scalar field , the scalar field can not experience the restoration of the symmetry and results in the symmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "the actual situation lies somewhere between these two extreme cases .",
    "therefore , to see whether the scalar field experiences the trapping or not , we have to study in detail the dynamics of scalar field and compare the time scale of dynamics with that of cosmic expansion . on this respect , the phenomenon called non - thermal phase transition  @xcite and moduli trapping  @xcite was studied previously .",
    "the complete analysis of dynamics of scalar field in a concrete setup including interactions with standard model ( sm ) sector in thermal environment has been lacking . in a realistic setup",
    ", such a scalar field often interacts with gauge - charged matters and the background is filled with thermal plasma after inflation .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to analyze the scalar dynamics with symmetry breaking potential by taking into account all possible relevant effects : thermal correction to the scalar potential , dissipative effects on the scalar field , non - perturbative particle production and the resulting modification on the scalar potential .    to make our discussion concrete",
    ", we will pay particular attention to the dynamics of saxion in a class of supersymmetric ( susy ) axion model .",
    "we will show that , even if the initial amplitude of the saxion is much larger than the pq scale , the zero - mode of the saxion field is eventually trapped at the symmetry enhanced point in large parameter space ; this is due to the modification of the saxion potential and the dissipation of the oscillation .",
    "thus , the thermal inflation  @xcite is quite often caused by the saxion .",
    "we also study the scalar dynamics after phase transition .",
    "we find the situation where thermal dissipation into sm plasma efficiently reduces the saxion energy density without axion overproduction .",

    "[ sec : saxion ] , we study the saxion dynamics in detail in the cases of both small and large mixing between pq and sm quarks . we will study in detail whether the saxion is trapped at the origin or not by taking account for thermal and non - thermal effects in the following sections ( sec .",

    "here , we consider the evolution of a complex scalar field which is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath7 symmetry ; the ( zero - temperature ) potential of @xmath4 has a minimum at @xmath8 . above this scale ,",
    "the potential of @xmath4 , which is lifted by the susy breaking effect , is assumed to be quadratic : @xmath9 in addition , the scalar @xmath4 is assumed to have interactions with scalar @xmath10 and fermion @xmath11 as @xmath12 with coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are assumed to have sm gauge interactions . having a susy model in mind , we call @xmath11 and @xmath10 as quark and squark , respectively , hereafter",
    ".    how does the phase transition proceed ?",
    "as described in the introduction , the usual arguments are as follows . at high temperature",
    ", @xmath4 sits at the origin @xmath5 due to thermal effective potential . in our case , it may be caused by the interaction with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , thermal effects become less significant , and finally @xmath4 relaxes to the minimum @xmath15 .    however , it is non - trivial whether @xmath4 actually starts at the point @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that initially , just after inflation , @xmath4 is placed far from the origin : @xmath16 .",
    "this assumption is quite natural if @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "an immediate consequence is that since @xmath10 and @xmath11 get large masses from the vev of @xmath4 , they may decouple from thermal bath even after the reheating , depending on the reheating temperature .",
    "thus we need to investigate the dynamics of @xmath4 in order to see whether @xmath4 will be eventually trapped at @xmath6 or not .    *",
    "if @xmath19 is large enough , @xmath10 and @xmath11 decouple from thermal bath .",
    "still , however , @xmath4 feels thermal effects through the so - called thermal logarithmic potential  @xcite , which may tend to stabilize @xmath4 toward the origin . *",
    "the dissipation is essential to effectively reduce the coherent oscillation energy density  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we must take into account thermal dissipation effects on the scalar in order to see @xmath4 truly relaxes to the origin . * in the limit of low reheating temperature , such thermal effects would be inefficient .",
    "even in such a case , because of the large amplitude of @xmath4 , non - perturbative particle production events happen at each oscillation of @xmath4 .",
    "then , the finite number density of @xmath10 and @xmath11 modifies the effective potential of @xmath4 which also tends to stabilize @xmath4 at the origin . * the produced @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay or annihilate depending on their interactions to the sm particles .",
    "if @xmath11 has the same gauge quantum numbers as of right - handed down - type quarks , for example , we may obtain the following mixing term @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are sm left - handed quark and higgs boson , respectively . with the above interaction , @xmath11 soon decays and generates thermal plasma . even without such mixings , annihilation processes into sm particle",
    "also reduce @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which would also generate thermal plasma . through these processes ,",
    "@xmath4 coherent oscillation effectively lose its energy by producing thermal plasma , which may significantly affect the scalar dynamics .",
    "thus the actual dynamics of the scalar @xmath4 would be complicated due to the combinations of these effects .",
    "we will analyze the scalar dynamics in sec .",
    "[ sec : saxion ] with an explicit example of the saxion in susy axion model , but we emphasize that the analysis can be applied to general class of scalar fields with symmetry breaking potential . in the rest of this section , we briefly summarize the thermal effects and particle production processes .",
    "when the primordial inflation ends , the scalar field @xmath4 may be displaced far from the true vacuum @xmath23 .",
    "eventually , it begins to relax towards the equilibrium state which is not necessarily identical to the true vacuum because there is a background thermal plasma .",
    "even with this initial condition , which is far from the origin of potential , the scalar field may be trapped at the origin due to thermal effects since the ( s)quarks become massless at the origin of scalar potential . in addition , even if thermal effects are not efficient , the scalar field can be trapped by the explosive production of squarks via the parametric resonance  @xcite .",
    "now let us summarize the effect of background thermal plasma at the beginning of scalar coherent oscillation and also the conditions for non - perturbative particle production in the presence of thermal plasma  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss whether the saxion is trapped at the origin or not by taking account for thermal and non - thermal effects in the following sections ( sec .",
