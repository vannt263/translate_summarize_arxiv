    "the performance of a quantum computer relies on certain universal one - qubit and two - qubit logic gates .",
    "any quantum computation @xcite can be reduced to a sequence of these gates @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of experimental systems proposed as candidates for implementing these logic gates and many of these have been implemented .",
    "we may mention trapped ions @xcite , cavity qed @xcite , nmr @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and neutral atoms in optical lattice @xcite as examples .",
    "some of the basic two - qubit logic gates are the conditional quantum phase gate ( qpg ) @xcite , controlled - not ( cnot ) gate which is a universal two qubit gate @xcite , swap gate etc .",
    "it should be mentioned that a @xmath0 shift of qpg and appropriate rotation of the second qubit realize the cnot gate .",
    "the qpg can be performed using a three - level atom interacting with a detuned cavity .",
    "the two - photon transitions are especially attractive in this case as then one can work with long - lived ground states of the atom .",
    "in such a situation the excited state does not participate in the transition and thus it is possible to minimize the effect of decoherence associated with the finite lifetime of the excited state @xcite .",
    "however , the two - photon transitions have complications associated with stark shifts of the energy levels .",
    "the stark shifts are quite natural to any two - photon process as one considers single - photon transitions which are detuned from the intermediate levels .",
    "if one ignores stark shifts , as is very often done , then the nature of the two - photon process becomes similar to the one - photon process and many of the results like rabi oscillations carry over to two - photon processes . in this paper",
    "we consider a situation where a three - level atom in @xmath1 configuration interacts with a bimodal cavity where the modes are highly detuned from the corresponding one - photon transition .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of performing a number of logic operations ( e.g. , qpg , cnot , swap ) using two - photon raman transition . we show this in spite of the non - zero stark shifts in the raman transitions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model system and its theoretical description . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how different two - qubit logic gate operations can be performed using this model . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the role of stark shift in quantum logic gate operations .",
    "let us consider a three - level atomic configuration [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the atom passes through a bimodal cavity . the modes with annihilation operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 interact with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 transitions , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian under rotating wave approximation can be written as @xmath6 \\label{fullhamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath7 @xmath8 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath9 @xmath10 is the frequency of the cavity modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath11 is the atom - cavity coupling constant .",
    "we assume @xmath11 to be real .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture can be written as @xmath12 , \\label{hamil1}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the one - photon detuning of the cavity modes .    if the initial number of photons in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , then the state vector of the atom - cavity system can be expanded in terms of the possible basis states in the following way : @xmath17    where , @xmath18 s @xmath19 are the probability amplitudes for the corresponding states",
    ". the amplitude equations can be obtained from the schrdinger equation as @xmath20-i\\delta_1 d_2,\\\\ \\dot{d}_3&=&-ig_2\\sqrt{\\mu+1}d_2-i(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)d_3,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the following transformations have been used : @xmath21    we now work under the limit of large one - detunings .",
    "we assume that , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this limit",
    ", we put @xmath25 and the amplitude equations ( [ ampequ ] ) reduce to    @xmath26 , \\\\",
    "\\dot{d}_3&=&-i(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)d_3+\\frac{ig^2\\sqrt{\\mu+1}}{\\delta_1}\\left[\\sqrt{n}d_1+\\sqrt{\\mu+1}d_3\\right]\\;.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ amp1 ]    we note that the eqs .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) can be obtained from an effective hamiltonian given by @xmath27\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{\\hbar g^2}{\\delta_1}\\left[|g\\rangle\\langle f|a^\\dag b+|f\\rangle\\langle g|a b^\\dag\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)|f\\rangle\\langle f| . \\label{effham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the first two terms represent the stark shifts and the next two terms give the interaction leading to a transition from the initial state to the final state .",
    "the last term represents a shifting of the level @xmath28 due to the two - photon detuning . from the hamiltonian ( [ effham ] )",
    ", one can easily see that the stark shift terms are of the _ same order of magnitude _ ( @xmath29 ) as the coupling term , and thus are as important as the coupling term and should be kept in further discussion .",
    "so one can not ignore these stark shift terms from the hamiltonian .",
    "the solution of eqs .",

    "the solution reduces to    @xmath35(e^{i\\theta}-1)+d_1(0)\\;,\\\\ d_3(t)&=&\\frac{1}{2}[d_1(0)+d_3(0)](e^{i\\theta}-1)+d_3(0)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ amp2 ]    where @xmath36 .",
    "we note that , if we exclude stark shift terms from the hamiltonian ( [ effham ] ) , and work under two - photon resonance ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) then the effective hamiltonian reduces to @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the atomic two - photon creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equations using this hamiltonian is    @xmath40    [ soln1 ]    which represents a rabi oscillation of the vector @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we will show how different kinds of two - qubit logic gates can be performed using the present model .",
    "let us first consider the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) under the total effective hamiltonian ( [ effham ] ) ( with @xmath42 ) , given by eqs . ( [ solns ] ) . from these solutions",
    "one can easily see that , if @xmath43 then , for an interaction time @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 @xmath46 becomes @xmath47 for the initial condition @xmath48 . at this particular interaction time",
    ", one can perform the following qpg operation : latexmath:[\\ ] ] here @xmath88 is the projection operator with the eigenvalues ) and 1 . the swap gate of sec .",
    "[ sec : swap ] can also be implemented using the above unitary operator for @xmath78 .",
    "it is also very interesting to note that not only for a particular phase relation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , but for any arbitrary phase between them , the swap gate works in the following way : @xmath89 is defined through the relation @xmath90 .",
    "we should emphasize that all these universal logic gates are the key resource in quantum computation .",
    "our method and system can also be used to prepare two - particle and three - particle entangled states involving metastable states of the atoms . this can be done by sequentially addressing the atoms by the two - mode cavity under two - photon resonance condition ( cf .",
    "next we investigate the role of the stark shift term in performing the logic gates .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian ( [ effham1 ] ) under two - photon resonance condition which _ excludes the stark shift term_. from the corresponding solutions of ( [ soln1 ] ) for the probability amplitudes , one can obtain the following qpg operation with a @xmath91-pulse ( @xmath92 ) : @xmath93 ) ] and continue to work under the two - photon resonance condition , one can not achieve phase gate operation .",
    "it should be borne in mind that one can not ignore the stark shift term as they are as important as the coupling term in the hamiltonian .",
    "iiia shows how to perform the qpg in spite of the stark shift term .",
    "we used the extra freedom provided by two - photon detunings in our model .",
    "we should mention here that many authors have utilized an additional field to cancel the unwanted stark shifts @xcite .",
    "we also note that in the context of other models , stark shifts have been used for two - qubit logic @xcite , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite , and quantum holography @xcite .",
    "note that , recently , solano _ et al .",
    "_ have reported a qpg operation based on the interaction of a three - level atom in ladder configuration and two modes of a cavity ( each mode can have either zero or one photon ) .",
    "the cavity modes are highly detuned from single photon transition ( see fig .",
    "2 , @xcite ) , but are two - photon resonant . they have shown how excluding the self - energy terms in the effective hamiltonian , one can perform a qpg operation in photonic hilbert space ( @xmath94 conclusions -----------    in conclusion , we have presented a system where a three - level atom in @xmath1-configuration interacts with a high - q bimodal optical cavity , with the cavity modes being highly detuned from the corresponding single - photon transitions .",
    "we have shown how a variety of logic operations can be performed using the ground states of the atoms .",
    "the decoherence associated due to spontaneous emission is thus negligible , though the quality of the cavity would lead some decoherence .",
    "we further emphasize that stark shifts are systematically included in our case .",
    "further the present system can be used to prepare bipartite and tripartite entangled states involving the metastable states of the atoms .",
