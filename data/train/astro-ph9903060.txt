    "the study of the global velocity field of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcd hereafter ; thuan & martin 1981 ) provides important clues about their gravitational potential , since these systems are rotationally supported ( e.g. van zee et al@xmath12 1998 ) .",
    "high spatial resolution hi observations have shown that the rotation curves of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( meurer , staveley - smith & killeen 1998 ; van zee et al@xmath12 1998 ) and dwarf irregulars ( di hereafter ; moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ) are nearly flat in the galaxy outer regions and have nearly constant velocity gradients within their optical radius . also , optical studies of the velocity field of the ionized gas in bcds obtain constant velocity gradients , characteristic of a _ solid - body _ rotation law ( see petrosian et al@xmath12 1997 for i  zw  18 ) .",
    "although the neutral ( see van zee et al@xmath12 1998 and references therein ) and molecular hydrogen ( young & knezek 1989 ; israel , tacconi & bass 1998 ) are quite abundant in blue compact dwarfs and dwarf irregulars , they are not enough to reproduce the flattening of the rotation curve . like in spiral galaxies , the existence of this flattening in the rotation curve of dwarf galaxies has been related with the presence of large amounts of dark matter in galaxy outer regions ( carignan & freeman 1988 ; carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; broeils 1992 ) .",
    "the dark matter content derived indicates that dark matter is even more abundant in dwarfs that in more massive galaxies ( see moore 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , standard cold dark matter ( cdm hereafter ) models predict that low - mass halos are denser than more massive systems , because their higher formation redshift ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 , nfw hereafter ) .",
    "the density profiles of the simulated cdm halos fall with radius as @xmath13 .",
    "this is density profile expected for a flat rotation curve body .    the competition between the dark matter and the stellar mass components within the optical radius difficults the analysis of _ solid - body _ portion of the rotation curve .",
    "several works have argued that dark matter in dwarf galaxies dominates the total mass density profile even within their optical radius ( carignan & beaulieu 1989 ; broeils 1992 ) , showing a constant density dark matter _ core _",
    "( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ; salucci & persic 1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , lo , sargent & young and staveley - smith , davies & kinman deduced reasonable virial mass to blue light ratios , lower than 7m@xmath11/l@xmath11 , for a large fraction of their samples .",
    "loose & thuan found that the virial mass of haro  2 can be reproduced just adding the stellar and hi mass components . also the study of swaters of the rotation curves of 44 dwarf galaxies indicates that the mass of a large fraction of these galaxies could be dominated by the stellar component , even at distances larger than three disk scale lengths .",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainty in all these studies is the mass - to - light ratio adopted for the stellar component ( meurer , staveley - smith & killeen 1998 ; swarters 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , high quality optical and near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy in order to obtain the physical parameters of the stellar populations and derive reasonable mass - to - light ratios is mandatory to prevent this inconvenient which is inherent to this kind of kinematical studies .",
    "superimposed on the regular _ solid - body _ portion of the velocity field , peculiar motions of the ionized gas have been observed in many star forming dwarf galaxies ( tomita et al@xmath12 1997 ; petrosian et al@xmath12 1997 ) .",
    "they have been commonly explained as infalling motions of hii regions @xcite , multiple clouds merging @xcite and local peculiar gas motions induced by violent star formation events @xcite .",
    "very high star formation rates associated with these intense star forming events have been demonstrated to be able to produce a cavity of shock - heated gas due to the energy input provided by supernovae and stellar winds ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; vader 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "this hot gas will accelerate the ambient interstellar medium resulting in a collective supernova - driven wind .",
    "in fact , several galactic supernova - driven winds phenomenae have been found to be associated with violent star formation places in dwarf galaxies ( roy et al@xmath12 1991 ; izotov et al@xmath12 1996 ; martin 1996 , 1998 , cm98 hereafter ) .",
    "they have been generally detected as holes in the neutral hydrogen distribution ( puche et al@xmath12 1992 ; brinks 1994 ) , bubbles or shells in h@xmath0 emission ( marlowe et al@xmath12 1995 , mhw hereafter ) or from their hot gas x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the existence of these phenomenae could produce the loss of a significant fraction of the galaxy interstellar medium . depending on the final destination of the accelerated gas",
    ", these structures could produce no mass loss , @xmath14-@xmath15 , only affecting the galaxy chemical evolution , or @xmath14-@xmath16 processes , with a significant loss of interstellar mass ( young & gallagher 1990 ; cm98 ; mac low & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , these supernova - driven galactic winds are accepted to be a key parameter in the dwarf galaxy formation ( silk et al@xmath12 1987 ; mori et al@xmath12 1997 ) and evolution ( mhw ; mac low & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "blue compact dwarf galaxies , with intense recent or ongoing star forming activity , are those systems where the interplay between _ star formation _ and the _ interstellar medium _ is more feasible to be studied . however , although the majority of the bcd galaxies are ie type bcds ( @xmath1770 per cent ; thuan 1991 ) , with star formation spreading over the whole galaxy , the effects of the supernova - driven winds have been mainly studied in dwarf amorphous galaxies ( see , e.g. mhw ) , which show nuclear star forming activity .    the galaxy mrk86=ngc  2537 ( shapley & ames 1932 ; markarian 1969 ) , also known as arp 6 @xcite , constitutes an excellent laboratory to test the properties and effects of the supernova - driven winds on the interstellar medium of dwarf galaxies , as a nearby prototype of the ie bcd galaxies class .    after introducing mrk86 in sect .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "we have used @xmath18=50kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath19=0.5 through this paper .",
    "the galaxy mrk86 ( @xmath0 ( 1950)= 08@xmath2009@xmath2143@xmath22 ; @xmath23 ( 1950)= + 460833 ) , as a prototype of the ie type bcd galaxies , is characterized by a smooth elliptical low surface brightness underlying stellar component on which several irregular knots of star formation are superimposed . see figure  [ image ] for a @xmath1-band image .",
    "up to 50 different knots have been detected ( gil de paz et al@xmath12 1999 , g99 hereafter ) . in the figure  [ field ]",
    "we show those line - emitting regions with h@xmath0 surface brightness higher than 1.5@xmath24ergs@xmath6@xmath25 . assuming a receding velocity of 443kms@xmath6 ( de vaucouleurs & pence 1980 ) ,",
    "the distance to mrk86 would be 8.9mpc and the physical scale 42.9pc/. mrk86 has an absolute magnitude of m@xmath26=@xmath27 , and it has been detected on 1.2 , 2.8 and 6.3 cm ( klein , wielebinski & thuan 1984 , klein , weiland & brinks 1991 ) ; the galaxy is a source of hi 21 cm emission ( thuan & martin 1981 ; bottinelli et al@xmath12 1984 ; whisp survey , kamphuis , sijbring & van albada 1996 ) ; also it was detected in co ( verter 1985 ; sage et al@xmath12 1992 ) ; it is a strong iras source ( lonsdale et al@xmath12 1985 ; dultzin - hacyan , masegosa & moles 1990 ) ; near - infrared data were obtained by thuan ; optical images were obtained by hodge & kennicutt , loose & thuan and ojha & joshi ; and , finally , ultraviolet spectra has been analyzed by fanelli , oconnell & thuan and longo et al@xmath12 .",
    "papaderos et al@xmath12 ( 1996a , 1996b ; p96a & p96b hereafter ) obtained the physical parameters of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 photometric components .",
    "these components have been related with three different stellar populations ( respectively , currently forming , @xmath171gyr and @xmath317gyr old ; gil de paz , zamorano & gallego 1998 , g98 hereafter ) .",
    ".journal of observations . [ cols=\"<,>,<,^,^ \" , ]     at 3(130pc ) to the ne from the bubble geometrical centre ( origin of coordinates in figure  [ bubbleb ] ) an optical emission knot ( # 49 in g99 ) is observed in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands ( figure  [ bubbleb ] , left panel ) .",
    "if we compare the instantaneous burst evolutionary synthesis lh models to the colours measured ( see sect .",
    "[ models ] and table  [ parameters ] ) , considering an age for the old underlying population of 7gyr ( g98 ) , the best fit obtained yields an starburst age of about 11.5myr , a burst strength of 1 per cent and a metallicity of about 0.1z@xmath11 .",
    "we are confident with the instantaneous burst assumption because we are dealing with single star forming regions ( lh ) . from the @xmath1-band total luminosity , and taking into account",
    "the burst strength derived , we estimate the involved total burst mass to be about 6.3@xmath32m@xmath11 .    assuming that the kinematical features observed represent the foreground and receding parts of the expanding bubble , the dynamical age for this bubble , obtained as @xmath33=0.6@xmath34 ,",
    "will be about 6.5myr , quite similar to the evolution time deduced for the starburst region , if we consider the massive stars main sequence time , i.e. about 4 - 5myr , subtracting it from the starburst age ( 11.5myr ) .    generally , the h@xmath0 luminosity observed in expanding bubbles is accepted to be produced by photoionization from massive stars of the starburst precursor ( mhw ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "then , the predicted collisionally excited h@xmath0 contribution should be irrelevant to the total h@xmath0 emission in the expanding lobes .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosities measured for both lobes are l@xmath35=4.7@xmath36ergs@xmath6 and l@xmath37=2.5@xmath7ergs@xmath6 . considering that both lobes are well reproduced by ellipsoids of revolution ,",
    "we can obtain the lobe surface areas , that allow to estimate the colissionally produced h@xmath0 luminosity @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hi ambient density , @xmath40 the bubble expansion velocity , @xmath41 is the number of h@xmath0 photons produced per shocked proton , and @xmath42 is the frequency of the h@xmath0 photons .",
    "the predicted collisionally excited luminosities are l@xmath35=2.4@xmath43ergs@xmath6 and l@xmath37=1.6@xmath43ergs@xmath6 , less than the 10 and 1 per cent of the total h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "we have assumed that approximately 0.1 h@xmath0 photons are produced per shocked proton .",
    "this is the value predicted by the shull & mckee models for a 50kms@xmath6 shock .",
    "we have also adopted a hi ambient density of @xmath440.3 @xmath45 , that is the same value adopted by mhw for a sample of dwarf amorphous galaxies .",
    "this value is obtained considering the galactocentric distance of the mrk86b bubble , 1.2kpc , and the galaxy hi density profile given by the equation  [ rhohi ] .    due to the uncertainties present in the hi total mass and scale measurements",
    ", we could be dealing with significantly higher hi ambient densities ( e.g. @xmath461@xmath45 ) , that could enhance the predicted collisional h@xmath0 luminosity . in any case",
    ", this contribution would not dominate the total h@xmath0 luminosity in the north lobe ( @xmath47% ) , and would be negligible in the south lobe case ( @xmath48% ) .",
    "then , if the emission is photoionization dominated , the ratio between the luminosity of both lobes has to be related with the solid angle subtended from the starburst by each lobe .",
    "in fact , assuming revolution symmetry for both lobes , the solid angle ratio obtained is @xmath49=5.5 ( @xmath50=6.6sr and @xmath51=1.2sr ) , very close to the ratio l@xmath52=5.3 . in the right panel of figure  [ bubbleb ]",
    "we show the aperture angles assumed , and the position of the ionizing radiation source ( # 49 knot in g99 ) .    in order to estimate the relevance of the shock excitation mechanism , we have also studied the [ oii]3727/[oiii]5007 , [ oiii]5007 / h@xmath9 , [ nii]6583 / h@xmath0 and ( [ sii]6717@xmath536731)/h@xmath0 line ratios across both lobes ( see figures  [ bratios]a &  [ bratios]b ) . for the south lobe region",
    "we obtain low excitation , log([oiii]/h@xmath9)@xmath170.3 , but with moderate log([oii]/[oiii])@xmath170.3 values .",
    "these values can be explained using photoionization models with low ionization parameter ( log u@xmath10@xmath544 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "however , for the more remote north lobe regions the very high log([oii]/[oiii])@xmath170.6 ( figure  [ bratios]a ) and high log([nii]/h@xmath0)@xmath17@xmath540.5 and log([sii]/h@xmath0)@xmath170 ( figure  [ bratios]b ) values obtained imply that an _",
    "additional _ excitation mechanism should be present ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "these line ratios are well reproduced taking into account the emission predicted from the models of shull & mckee with shock velocities of 90kms@xmath6 .",
    "this result is consistent with the higher collisional h@xmath0 luminosity predicted for the north lobe of the bubble .      from the high - resolution spectra",
    "# 7r and # 8r we infer the presence of deep velocity minima close to the g99 # 9 knot emission maximum ( c region in figures  [ image ] and  [ aregion ] ) .",
    "these minima observed in both spectra # 7r and # 8r ( see figures  [ cratios]a &  [ cratios]b ) are well understood if we are dealing with the foreground part of a highly extinct expanding bubble , with median parameters , @xmath55=110pc and @xmath40=17.3kms@xmath6 ( @xmath564myr ) .",
    "these parameters ( see table  [ parameters ] ) are obtained fitting the radial velocity profiles ( global velocity gradient subtracted ; @xmath57 ) to an isotropic expanding structure velocity law ( see figures  [ cratios]a &  [ cratios]b ) @xmath58 the central starburst should have a high extinction , large enough to obscure the h@xmath0 emission of the receding part of the bubble . in order to test this hypothesis we should estimate the physical properties , extinction included , of the starburst which has originated this collective wind .",
    "the mrk86c bubble has similar appearance in all the optical and nir images , including the h@xmath0 image ( see figure  [ aregion ] ) , in contrast with the b bubble case , probably due to its lower dynamical time .",
    "its h@xmath0 emission is slightly more extended along the w - e than that observed in broad - band filters .",
    "the corresponding optical and nir colours measured for the starburst are given in the table  [ parameters ] and are fully compatible with a 7.7myr old and z=0.1z@xmath11 metallic region , adopting , in order to better fit the colours measured , an colour excess of e@xmath59=0.73 .    from these parameters , and the total @xmath1 absolute magnitude measured , applying the lh results we obtain a starburst mass of about 4.7@xmath32m@xmath11 .",
    "in addition , because the total h@xmath0 luminosity measured for mrk86c , 1.7@xmath8ergs@xmath6 , is 6@xmath60 times higher than that predicted for the collisional case , 2.7@xmath61ergs@xmath6 , we can conclude that the line emission is also in mrk86c mainly due to photoionized gas .",
    "finally , we have studied the [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios measured from the high resolution spectra .",
    "they change between @xmath100.10 in regions close to the starburst centre , and @xmath100.25 and @xmath100.30 , respectively , in the external low h@xmath0 surface brightness bubble regions ( see figures  [ cratios]a &  [ cratios]b ) .",
    "the increase in line ratios values towards bubble outer regions seems again to indicate a decrease in the ionization parameter due to the dilution of the radiation from the centralized source @xcite .",
    "the values obtained are compatible with a pure low - metallicity hii region photoionization mechanism ( see , e.g. shields & filippenko 1990 ) .",
    "we have measured the ionized gas velocity dispersion for the # 7r and # 8r high - resolution spectra . from the calibration lamp and night sky lines",
    "we have estimated the spectral resolution in @xmath62=16.4@xmath632.1kms@xmath6 .",
    "then , we have obtained the velocity dispersion of the mrk86c bubble from these spectra , subtracting to @xmath64 the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the spatial variation of these velocity dispersion measured is shown in figure  [ cratios ] . the velocity dispersion obtained for the _ whole _ ( @xmath66 ) bubble c were @xmath67=16@xmath632kms@xmath6 and @xmath68=15@xmath632kms@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we have obtained the _",
    "mean _ velocity dispersion for the whole emitting region , averaging the values measured in intervals of 033 , 1  and 2  along the spatial direction .",
    "we have estimated 17@xmath633 and 14.9@xmath631.6kms@xmath6 , respectively for the # 7r and # 8r spectra and 033 intervals , 18@xmath635 and 15.4@xmath630.5kms@xmath6 for 1  intervals , and finally , 19@xmath635 and 15.2@xmath630.3kms@xmath6 for 2  intervals .",
    "we observe that there is no significant differences between local and total velocity dispersion values , i.e. the velocity widths obtained for regions of size @xmath69 are similar to that obtained for an important fraction of the whole emitting region ( @xmath66 ) , and that they do not change with the considered spatial interval@xmath12    we have now considered the expresion for the mass of a virialized system given by guzmn et al@xmath12 ( 1996 , 1997 ; see also bender , burstein & faber 1992 and gallego et al@xmath12 1998 ) , @xmath70 if we take for mrk86c the @xmath1-band effective radius of the starburst measured with cobra , @xmath7136pc , and @xmath7215kms@xmath6 , we obtain a virialized mass ( eq .  [ virialmass ] ) for mrk86c of about @xmath73m@xmath11 .",
    "let us compare this result with the mrk86c starburst total mass estimated from the mass in newly formed stars ( @xmath74=5.3@xmath32m@xmath11 ) , underlying stellar population , gas and dark matter present in this region .",
    "considering the mass density profile given in sect .",
    "[ global ] we can estimate the mass content inside the effective radius of the mrk86c starburst precursor . assuming the most favourable case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath75=0  and a dark matter model with @xmath76=2@xmath77 , the density expected at a galactocentric distance , @xmath3=1.0kpc , will be about 9at@xmath78@xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the mass content inside @xmath79 should be about 10@xmath80m@xmath11 .",
    "we can conclude that the burst total mass is significantly lower that the virialized mass deduced .",
    "the similarity of the velocity dispersion measured pixel by pixel rules out the global velocity gradient as origin for the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "first reason for mrk86c not to be bound arises from the existence of local gas motions induced by the mrk86c supernova - driven wind .",
    "another argument is mrk86c is not placed at the galactic centre and , therefore , is subject of strong tidal forces that prevents it to be virialized .",
    "we have obtained the turbulent velocity dispersion ( see , e.g. fuentes - masip 1997 ) , applying the expression @xmath81 that yields a @xmath8210.7kms@xmath6 and 10.0kms@xmath6 , respectively for # 7r and # 8r spectra , assuming for h@xmath0 an @xmath83=7.1kms@xmath6 @xcite , and a temperature , @xmath84=10@xmath85k . adopting a sound velocity for the ionized gas in hii regions of about 12.8kms@xmath6 @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath86 is approximately 8kms@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the velocity dispersion in this region is sonic or slightly supersonic .",
    "1 .   the global velocity field in mrk86",
    "has a central angular velocity of about 34kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 with orientation pa@xmath1012  ( rotation axis pa@xmath8778 ) .",
    "this velocity gradient shows a progressive diminution towards outer galaxy regions , from 34kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 at the galactic centre to @xmath1010kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 at 1kpc .",
    "the density profiles of the different mass components indicate that the underlying stellar component dominates the total mass within its optical radius .",
    "the velocity gradients measured for different distances along the galactic rotation axis indicate that the ionized gas is probably distributed in a inclined rotating disk , with inclination in relation to the plane of the sky of about 50 .",
    "high velocity gradients of about 70kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 associated with intense star forming regions have been observed . both , a high mass concentration or a recent merger could be responsible for these local , steep velocity gradients .",
    "our observations have revealed the existence of two bubbles , mrk86b and mrk86c .",
    "they present @xmath40 of 34 and 17kms@xmath6 and @xmath55 of 374 and 120pc , respectively .",
    "these structures are driven by supernovae and massive stars winds originated in two low metallicity ( z@xmath100.1z@xmath11 ) hii regions 11 and 8myr old , with masses of 6.3@xmath32 and 5.3@xmath32m@xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is dominated by photoionization mechanisms , contributing at least with the 90 per cent of the total h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "moreover , the optical line ratios measured agree with photoionization mechanisms as the origin for their emission .",
    "4 .   in addition",
    ", we have studied the physical properties of the starburst precursor of the mrk86a bubble described by martin .",
    "the optical - nir colours measured for these region are well described by a 14myr old , low metallicity ( z@xmath100.25z@xmath11 ) , 10@xmath80m@xmath11 massive starburst .",
    "+ the predicted starburst ages agree quite well with the dynamical times measured if we assume a delay of @xmath104myr between the starburst formation and the time when the bubble begins to inflate .",
    "in fact , the one tenth solar metallicity leitherer & heckman models predict an increment of about 1.5dex in the deposition rate of mechanical energy 4myr after the star formation burst .",
    "the global velocity dispersion obtained for mrk86c does not trace the total mass of the burst .",
    "the turbulent velocity dispersion obtained for the mrk86c bubble is sonic or slightly supersonic , with @xmath8810kms@xmath6 .",
    "these values do not show significant changes across the region .",
