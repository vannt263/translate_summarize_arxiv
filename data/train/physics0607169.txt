    ".    equation ( [ eq : convolution ] ) shows that the width of the sbs amplifying resonance can be increased by using a broadband pump .",
    "regardless of the shape of the pump power spectrum , the resultant sbs spectrum is approximately equal to the pump spectrum when the pump bandwidth is much larger than the intrinsic sbs linewidth .",
    "this increased bandwidth comes at some expense : the sbs gain coefficient scales inversely with the bandwidth , which must be compensated using a higher pump intensity or using a fiber with larger @xmath16 .    to develop a quantitative model of the broadband sbs slow - light",

    "figures [ fig : pattern](a)-(c ) show the delayed pulse waveforms of three simple nrz data patterns with a bit - rate of 14 gb / s .",
    "it is clear that the pulses overlap when they are closer to each other , which degrades the system performance . to quantify the signal quality degradation , we use q - factor ( signal quality factor ) of input and output pulses , which is defined as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the mean and standard deviation of the signal samples when a ` 1 ' or ` 0 ' is received .",
    "we examine the q - penalty ( decrease in q - factor ) produced by the broadband sbs slow - light system by numerical simulations .",

    "is assumed to be gaussian - shaped with a pulsewidth ( fwhm ) of the bit time ( 100 ps for 10 gb / s , 75 ps for 13.3 gb / s ) .",
    "the slow - light delay is normalized by the bit time so that q - penalties in different bit - rate systems can be compared .",
    "it is seen that the q - penalty increases approximately linearly with the normalized delay , and that the 13.3 gb / s data rate incurs a higher penalty than the 10 gb / s data rate . the penalty is higher at the higher data rate because the higher - speed signal is more vulnerable to the pattern dependence , especially when the slow - light bandwidth is comparable to the signal bandwidth .",
    "error - free transmission ( ber @xmath66 ) is found at a normalized delay of 0.25 or less . in an optimized system , it is expected that the pattern dependence can be decreased using a spectrum - efficient signal modulation format or the signal carrier frequency detuning technique  @xcite , for example .",
    "in summary , we have increased the bandwidth of sbs slow light in an optical fiber to over 12 ghz by spectrally broadening the pump laser , thus demonstrating that it can be integrated into existing data systems operating over 10 gb / s .",
    "we observed a pattern dependence whose power penalty increases with increasing slow - light delay ; research is underway to decrease this dependence and improve the performance of the high - bandwidth sbs slow - light system .",
