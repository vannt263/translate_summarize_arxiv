    "there is now a substantial body of work to suggest that life on earth arose from an initial reservoir of simpler organic material that formed in the presolar nebula rather than on the early earth ( see e.g holtom et al .",
    "2005 ; bailey et al .",
    "1998 ; hunt - cunningham & jones 2004 ) .",
    "these arguments centre around    1 .",
    "primitive mechanisms of self - replication involving only rna , which indicate the need for a reservoir of homochiral ( having like chirality ) organic molecules on the early earth before living organisms could evolve ( joyce et al .",
    "1984 ) , and 2 .",
    "the lack of any known abiotic mechanisms operating on the surface of the earth to generate the required enantiomeric excess @xcite .    however , an extraterrestrial origin for this reservoir is not universally accepted , and mechanisms which could amplify an enantiomeric excess on planetary surfaces , such as catalytic processes on the surfaces of minerals , have also been suggested ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the detection of chiral molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ) would lend support to an extraterrestrial origin for the initial reservoir of prebiotic molecules . despite a possible extraterrestrial origin for homochiral molecules ,",
    "none of the molecules so far detected in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is chiral .",
    "one relatively simple chiral molecule that may be present in detectable quantities in the ism is propylene oxide ( c - c@xmath3h@xmath4o ) ( fig [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "its non - chiral lower homologue , ethylene oxide ( c - c@xmath5h@xmath6o ) , has been detected in the ism ( dickens et al .",
    "in addition , propylene ( c@xmath3h@xmath4 ) , although not yet detected in the ism , is considered important as an intermediary in the production of ism polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( kaiser et al .",
    "propylene oxide is known to form in the gas phase from the oxidation of propylene ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although the likelihood of this mechanism in interstellar contexts has not yet been studied .",
    "the known interstellar homologue of propylene oxide , ethylene oxide , is isomeric with two other known interstellar species : acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath3cho ) and vinyl alcohol ( ch@xmath5=choh ) . the likelihood of interstellar propylene oxide is supported by the interstellar detection @xcite of its isomer propanal ( ch@xmath3ch@xmath5cho ) .    ) ]    another group of molecules of particular interest for the origin of life are the amino acids , which are generally chiral and which are likely to have been present in the presolar nebula .",
    "glycine , although not a chiral molecule , is the simplest amino acid utilized in biological processes on earth , and is found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites , which are thought to be relatively unprocessed remnants of the presolar nebula ( see e.g. wirick et al .",
    "however , despite numerous searches covering more than a quarter of a century ( see e.g. kuan et al .",
    "2004 ) glycine has not yet been incontrovertibly detected in the ism ( snyder et al .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that we now know of more than 130 molecular species in the ism , including molecules of similar complexity , such as acetic acid , which shares some structures with glycine .",
    "the reported detection by @xcite was disputed by @xcite , who concluded that if glycine was present in the compact hot cores of sgr b2 ( n - lmh ) , orion kl and w51 e1/e2 then it could only be in the form of the higher energy conformer ii . in jones et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter ) , we showed , using observations from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , that glycine conformer ii could not be present at the levels reported by @xcite for sgr b2 ( n - lmh ) if it was confined to small scales on the order of the lmh continuum source ( @xmath7 5 arcsec ) .",
    "in this paper we report on a search for glycine ( conformer ii ) and propylene oxide in more extended gas using the mopra telescope .",
    "we have also serendipitously observed several transition frequencies of glycine conformer i. the search was initially prompted by the new availability of laboratory measured ( rather than calculated ) transition frequencies for both molecules in the 86 - 115 ghz range , allowing the search to be undertaken with high frequency resolution . the search has involved a multi - pronged approach , using both atca and the mopra telescope , as it was not clear whether the molecules were most likely to be found in small diameter hot cores , in which case an interferometer is the best strategy , or whether they were more likely to be extended , in which case a single dish telescope is the preferred instrument .",
    "gives a detailed justification of the search strategy .",
    "most previous searches for glycine have been for glycine i , so we have concentrated on glycine ii .",
    "this conformer has relatively stronger transitions than conformer i , owing to its larger dipole moment , although it is higher in energy . under laboratory conditions glycine ii is more readily detected in the higher temperature gas , and the expected line intensities of the two conformers equalise at 285 k @xcite .",
    "under interstellar conditions the energy barrier between conformers i and ii will inhibit relaxation from one to the other , so the relative abundance of the two conformers will depend on the chemical and thermal history of the gas .",
    "single - dish observations in the 3-mm band were made with the 22-m mopra telescope of the australia telescope national facility , during 2002 and 2003 . there were two pointing positions used in each of sgr b2 and orion .",

    "k. the energy levels of glycine ii are expressed relative to the lowest energy state of glycine i in the jpl database and table 5 , but we have considered the two conformers as separate species in the total column density calculations .",
    "hence when correcting for the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of levels we converted the energies to those relative to the lowest energy state of glycine ii for the @xmath31 factor .",
    "although we primarily concentrated on glycine ii , we also serendipitously observed glycine i transitions in three tunings , namely 94045 , 96413 and 113153 .",
    "we were not able to obtain an upper limit for the transition at 96414 mhz in the 96413 tuning due to contamination from a strong adjacent transition of c@xmath32s at 96416 mhz .",
    "likewise we were not able to obtain upper limits for the 113156 transition of glycine i in sgr b2 due to contamination in the 113153 tuning , due to c@xmath33o contamination from the lower side band .",
    "however , in tunings 94055 ( orion kl and sgr b2 ( lmh ) ) and 113153 ( orion kl ) we had clear portions of spectra at the expected positions of the transitions and so were able to obtain good upper limits ( table [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "we find upper limits for glycine i abundance of 3.7 @xmath0 @xmath1 in both orion - kl and sgr b2 ( lmh ) .",
    "this 3sigma limit is of the same order as the reported detection of conformer i by @xcite of 4.4 @xmath0 @xmath1 in orion  kl and 4.2 @xmath0 @xmath1 in sgr b2 ( lmh ) .",
    "however , our results are 3sigma upper limits rather than detections , and there is no evidence in the three good spectra for a weak feature at the expected positions .",
    "we conclude that this weighs against confirmation of the claimed detection of @xcite .",
    "we find upper limits for glycine ii abundance of 7.7 @xmath2 @xmath1 in both orion - kl and sgr b2 ( lmh ) .",
    "these are similar to the results of combes , rieu & wlodarczak ( 1996 ) who used the iram 30-metre telescope to search for glycine conformer ii in a number of molecular clouds , including sgr b2 and orion a. the limits obtained by @xcite for glycine conformer ii were 8@xmath2 @xmath1 in orion a and 1 @xmath34 @xmath1 in sgr b2 . in both orion kl and sgr b2 ( lmh ) ,",
    "our upper limits are over an order of magnitude lower than the reported detections of conformer i @xcite , who used observations from the nrao 12-m telescope , which like the mopra telescope will be most sensitive to extended emission .",
    "the results presented here show that glycine conformer ii is not present in the extended gas at the level detected by @xcite for conformer i , and the presence of both conformers in the compact hot lmh at the level reported by @xcite has previously been ruled out ( paper i ; snyder et al .",
    "although we can not completely rule out the presence of glycine conformer i in the extended gas , this scenario also seems unlikely , and we conclude that it is unlikely that glycine has been detected in the ism .",
    "a summary of these results is given in table [ tab6 ] .",
    "the difference in the upper limits for glycine ii compared to those of glycine i deserves some comment .",
    "it results partly from better sensitivity in some of the tunings which include glycine ii transitions , but the major effect is the higher dipole moment of conformer ii c.f .",
    "conformer i , as spectral intensity is proportional to the square of the dipole moment ( see e.g. paper 1 ) .",
    "if we use the reported detections of @xcite for conformer i ( similar to our upper limits ) then we find that the ratio of glycine conformer ii to conformer i is @xmath35 0.02 in both orion - kl and sgr b2 .",
    "given the high energy barrier between the two conformers , which prevents ready conversion of one to another , this ratio reflects the history of the glycine molecules rather than the current gas temperature .",
    "it suggests that the reactions by which glycine is produced favour conformer i , unless conformer i has an abundance far lower than the upper limits presented in this paper .",
    "we have also calculated the upper limits for the column density of propylene oxide ( table [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "we have assumed excitation temperature @xmath36 k and q(200 ) = 17811 from the approximate formula @xmath37 and the rotational constants a , b , c from creswell & schwendeman ( 1977 ) .",
    "the energy levels and einstein coefficients ( table [ tab5 ] ) were calculated with a rigid asymmetric rotor model , using the spectroscopic constants from creswell & schwendeman ( 1977 ) and the dipole moment components from swalen & herschbach ( 1957 ) .",
    "we find upper limits for propylene oxide abundance of 3.0 @xmath0 @xmath1 in orion - kl and 6.7 @xmath0 @xmath1 in sgr b2 ( lmh ) , assuming the propylene oxide emission is extended with respect to the mopra beam . in",
    "we reported upper limits for propylene oxide emission of 8.9 @xmath38 @xmath1 in sgr b2 ( lmh ) , assuming that the emission is extended with respect to the atca synthesized beam of 17.0 @xmath39 3.4 arcsec@xmath40 , so the mopra observations place a more stringent limit on the presence of propylene oxide in the extended gas of sgr b2 .",
    "ethylene oxide , the lower homologue of propylene oxide , was found by @xcite to have an abundance of 3.3 @xmath0 @xmath1 in sgr b2(n ) , with the emission likely to be originating from extended gas rather than a compact source .",
    "as it is unlikely that propylene oxide will be more abundant than ethylene oxide , the non  detection at the level of sensitivity achieved in the mopra observations is to be expected .",
    "we have detected fourteen features in sgr b2 and four features in orion - kl not previously reported in the ism ( tables and figures [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "some features are almost certainly the same carrier seen in the two separate velocity components of 64 and 73 km s@xmath41 present near sgr b2 ( lmh ) .",
    "uk86944 has a velocity separation of + 10.9 km s@xmath41 from uk86947 and so these are likely to be same transition seen in both components , as is likely to be the case for uk86979 and uk86976 ( separated by 10.9 km s@xmath41 ) .",
    "this also may be the case for uk113128 and uk113126 ( separation 5.3 km s@xmath41 ) although this spectrum is contaminated by @xmath33co in the lower side band so we have less confidence in the accuracy of the line centres .    the features uk86979 , uk86976 and uk86956 were also observed with the atca with a synthesized beam of 17.0 @xmath39 3.4 arcsec@xmath40 .",
    "these transitions are clearly seen in the atca spectrum , and have similar line profiles .",
    "for all three transitions the brightness temperature of the mopra observations compared with those of the atca are consistent with the carriers of these features being found in the hot core of the lmh rather than in the extended gas .",
    "the previously undetected features were checked against line frequencies from the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl , pickett et al .",
    "1998 ) and cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms , mller et al 2001 ) on - line databases .",
    "although a number of features were found to have coincident entries in the databases , all possibilities were ruled out by calculating the column density of the molecule that detection of the particular transition would imply , using the procedure described in section [ limits ] .",
    "we have used the mopra telescope to search for glycine conformers i and ii , and the simple chiral molecule propylene oxide , in sgr b2 ( lmh ) and orion kl . the major results are as follows :    * we did not detect either molecule but have been able to place sensitive upper limits on the column density of both .",
