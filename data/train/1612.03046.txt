    "fractional calculus is an effective tool to study nonlocal and memory effects in physics .",
    "successful applications to anomalous diffusion and evolution problems [ 14 ] were immediately followed by applications to quantum mechanics [ 512 ] .",
    "in particular , laskin s space fractional quantum mechanics is intriguing since it also follows from feynman s path integral approach over lvy paths [ 5 ] .",
    "one of the first solutions of the space fractional schrdinger equation was given for the infinite square well problem [ 6 ] . despite its simplicity ,",
    "this solution is important since it is basically the prototype of a quantum detector with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , this solution has also been the subject of some _ controversy _ and was used to point to the potential existence of an _ inconsistency _ in the solutions obtained by the piecewise method [ 1013 , 15 , 16 ] .",
    "the proposed inconsistency argument was based on the evaluation of a certain integral , which resulted when the solution for the box problem obtained by the piecewise method was substituted back into the schrdinger equation [ 15 , 16 ] .",
    "one of the crucial elements of the space fractional quantum mechanics is the riesz derivative .",
    "we have shown that a particular representation of the riesz derivative that accommodates analytic continuation can be used to evaluate the integral in question , thus resolving the so - called _ inconsistency problem _ [ 1013 ] .",
    "misleading conclusions regarding the laskin s space fractional quantum mechanics [ 5 ] often results when one ignores the basic assumptions and restrictions involved in the use of the riesz derivative [ 1521 ] .",
    "a crucial part of the space fractional quantum mechanics is the riesz derivative operator , @xmath3 , which satisfies the fractional diffusion equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6stable lvy distribution and @xmath7 @xmath8 is called the lvy index .",
    "the @xmath6 stable lvy distribution with @xmath9 has finite moments of order @xmath10 and infinite moments for higher orders [ 5 ] .",
    "the gaussian distribution , @xmath11 , is also stable with moments of all orders . in space",
    "fractional quantum mechanics , the existence of average position , @xmath12 and momentum , @xmath13 , of a particle demands that the moments of first order exist [ 5 ] . in this regard,@xmath14 has to be restricted to the range @xmath15 .",
    "even though the problems regarding a particular integral in the infinite box solution , which was the basis of the inconsistency arguments , has been resolved for the range @xmath16 potential issues regarding the @xmath17 limit of the solutions and its connection with the particular solution of the space fractional schrdinger equation for @xmath1 need to be clarified [ 20 ] .",
    "as the upper bound , @xmath18 is approached , the space fractional schrdinger equation approaches smoothly to the ordinary schrdinger equation for the classical particle .",
    "however , we can not say the same thing as @xmath19 approaches the lower bound .",
    "we will discuss in the last section that within the context of  the schrdinger theory , the interpretation of the _ ordinary derivative _ operator for the lower bound , @xmath1 , and the corresponding hamiltonian is dubious [ 17 , 18 ] .    in literature ,",
    "arguments about the @xmath1 case are usually carried over another representation of the riesz derivative , which is usually given as also valid for @xmath1 [ 3 , 2126 ] . to investigate this in detail , in section ii we start with a brief review of the riesz derivative , which is generally given in terms of its fourier transform and valid for the range @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 in section iii",

    "we scrutinize its derivation and its fourier transform , and on the contrary to common opinion , we show that its behavior at and near @xmath1 is no different than the previous definition . finally , in section iv we have conclusions and discuss the implications of our results in terms of laskin s space fractional quantum mechanics .",
    "we argue that the nonlocality implied by the riesz derivative is of different nature than the nonlocatily of the particular solution of the schrdinger equation for @xmath23",
    "riesz derivative , @xmath24 is usually defined in terms of its fourier transform as@xmath25 the fact that @xmath26 is not an analytic function does not allow one to use complex contour integral theorems . in space",
    "fractional quantum mechanics , one usually encounters real singular integrals like @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a complex valued even function with finite number of singular points on the real axis .",
    "one can also write @xmath29 as @xmath30 however , a common source of error is in dropping the absolute value sign and then evaluating the integral :  @xmath31 via the complex contour integral theorems [ 27 ] .",
    "the last step naturally alters the analytic structure of the riesz derivative and as in the box problem leads to misleading results [ 15 , 16 , 28 ] . in such situations , using the original expression of the riesz derivative [ 1013 ] that accommodates analytic continuation allows correct implementation of the contour integral theorems , thus resolving the controversy .    using the fourier transforms [ 13 ] : @xmath32 where @xmath33 we define the derivative@xmath34 the fourier transform of which is@xmath35 for real @xmath36 , the fourier transform , @xmath37 can be written as@xmath38 from here",
