    "superconducting transition - edge sensors ( tes ) have become very popular as practical radiation detectors because of their high sensitivity and energy resolution , maturity of the fabrication technology required allowing wafer - scale processing , and versatility , so that they can be used for detection of both particles and photons from sub - millimeter frequencies to gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the basic operational theory of a voltage - biased tes in electrothermal feedback was described long ago @xcite , however , in the original form the simplest possible thermal circuit was assumed , namely , that the detector could be described as a single lumped heat capacity , connected to the heat bath by a single thermal conductance .",
    "sometimes this thermal model is fairly adequate in describing the detector response @xcite , but some detector designs have been experimentally shown to behave in a more complex manner @xcite . therefore , theoretical modeling has been advanced in recent years to include more complex thermal circuits @xcite .",
    "one way to approach the problem is to generalize the problem fully to any number of heat capacity blocks and thermal conductances , and solve the obtained ( large ) linearized system of equations numerically @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it is straightforward to move from simple models to more complex models within the same formalism , and for the most complex models this may be the only approach available .",
    "nevertheless , for models of intermediate complexity , such as systems of two or three connected heat capacities , it is possible to calculate the detector properties analytically , as well .",
    "analytical solutions have the advantage that they are easier to work with , can be used further for fitting of experimental data , and a lot of results can be calculated quickly .",
    "one can quickly compute , for example , how the detector response changes as a function of a certain parameter of the thermal model .    here , we present analytical solutions for the complex impedance , responsivity , and all the unavoidable components of the current noise spectral density of a tes detector , for all possible two - block thermal models and two simplest three - block models , in a compact formulation .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that we also derive the analytical equation for the complex impedance of the detector @xcite of each model .",
    "measurement of the complex impedance of a tes detector has been shown in recent years @xcite to be a very valuable tool for characterising tes detectors ; in particular for the discussion here , it gives information about the thermal model .",
    "there is some previously published @xcite and unpublished @xcite analytical work on certain two- and three - block models of bolometers .",
    "those results describe some limits and special cases of this work . in refs .",
    "@xcite , some two - block models were discussed , and an approximation was made about the steady state temperature of the blocks . in refs .",
    "@xcite , equations for the impedance , responsivity and the noise equivalent power were given for one two - block and three three - block models , but the non - ohmic behavior of the bolometer @xcite was not fully discussed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two simple three - block models were discussed , but no simple analytical equations for the noise were given .",
    "the goal of the present work is thus to give an extensive set of equations for the responsivity , current noise and impedance in a compact and usable form , which can easily be used to analyze real noise and impedance data of tes detectors @xcite .",
    "we also give many example plots to show how various thermal parameters affect the detector properties .",
    "detailed discussion on the noise equivalent power , energy resolution and other figures of merit are left for future publications .",
    "we discuss here all three possible two - block cases , shown in fig [ twoblocks ] .",
    "one heat capacity block is always the tes film , where the joule power is dissipated , whereas the second block describes an additional thermal body , which could represent for example the insulating membrane , the absorber etc . @xcite .",
    "the formalism is kept general so that we do not need to decide on the physical picture _ a priori_.        the first case , shown in fig .",
    "[ twoblocks ] ( a ) , is where the extra heat capacity @xmath0 is connected to the tes heat capacity @xmath1 , but nowhere else .",
    "this type of model has sometimes been called the hanging or dangling heat capacity model . in the second case , shown in fig .",
    "[ twoblocks ] ( b ) , the extra heat capacity lies in between the tes and the heat bath .",
    "the main difference to the first model is that now the steady state temperature of the extra block is not equal to the tes temperature , unlike in the first case of fig .",
    "[ twoblocks ] ( a ) .",
    "we call this second model the intermediate model . finally , in the last model in fig .",
    "[ twoblocks ] ( c ) ( numerically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the extra block is connected to both the tes and the heat bath as in case ( b ) , but an additional parallel heat path exists between the tes and the bath .",
    "we call this the parallel model .",
    "the starting point for all calculations are the differential equations that describe the heat balance in the thermal circuits and the electrical equation of the simplest thevenin - equivalent input circuit of the tes , consisting here of an equivalent voltage @xmath2 , an equivalent resistance @xmath3 , and an inductance @xmath4 in series . for a simple one - block thermal circuit ,",
    "there is only one thermal equation , so that one needs to solve a coupled set of only two differential equations , as reviewed in ref .",
    "they are coupled because the resistance of the tes detector @xmath5 depends on temperature and current , and because the joule heating power @xmath6 in the tes depends on the electrical parameters .",
    "it is this coupling that produces the negative electrothermal feedback in the response of a voltage biased superconducting detector @xcite .",
    "for a two - block thermal model , one additional differential equation is added to represent the extra thermal body .",
    "the exact form of the thermal equations naturally depends on which model in fig .",

    "@xmath15 , on the other hand , is some time - dependent power input to the tes . using these equations ,",
    "the full time - dependent response ( temperature and current ) could , in principle , be solved .",
    "however , the power flows are non - linear functions of temperature , and the tes resistance is a non - linear function of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so that an analytical solution for the system is not tractable in the general ( large signal ) case . in this work , however , we are only interested in the impedance , noise and responsivity , all of which are traditionally defined only in the small - signal limit , where the non - linearities can be ignored . the linearization of eqs .",

    ". [ zitf ] thus shows that the complex impedance of the intermediate model behaves qualitatively exactly like the hanging model one , so that similar plots to fig .",
    "[ plotsh ] can be generated , but with different parameter values .",
    "it is therefore very hard , if not impossible , to distinguish between the hanging and intermediate models based on fitting impedance data alone , as was pointed out in refs . @xcite already .    in the intermediate model ,",
    "it is clear that the true loop gain is really different from the simple model , unlike in the hanging case , as the extra block affects the dc response .",
    "one way to find the loop gain is to look at the zero frequency limit of eq .",
    "doing that , one finds @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is an effective differential thermal conductance , which is a series combination of the two individual thermal conductances .",
    "notice , though , how @xmath52 has to be evaluated at different temperatures in the nominator and in the denominator .",
    "the added complication for analysis is that if @xmath9 is not directly measurable ( typical case ) , then the dc i - v measurements alone can not fix @xmath85 or the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as there are too many unknowns in the general case .",

    ", similar plots could be produced as for the two previous models , and thus distinguishing the parallel model from the hanging and intermediate models by fitting impedance data alone is quite hopeless . in the parallel model ,",
    "the true loop gain is still @xmath90 , but now the effective conductance is slightly more complex , as it is a combination of parallel and series components : @xmath99 naturally , similar analysis issues exist for this model as was discussed for the intermediate model .",
    "next , we turn from complex impedance to small - signal current responsivity , which describes the frequency - dependent current response of the device to power input to the tes .",
    "naturally , one can define responsivities for power inputs to the other heat capacity blocks as well , but here we concentrate only in the direct responsivity , as it is important for the noise analysis discussed in the next section .",
    "the responsivity for each variant of the two - block models can be calculated again from equations [ fouriereqs ] , by keeping the power term @xmath100 and by dropping the voltage bias modulation term @xmath101 .",
    "then , defining the responsivity as @xmath102 , one gets a result that looks a lot like @xmath82 , as we start from almost the same equations .",
    "therefore , for all models , we can write the responsivity as a function of @xmath82 and the total circuit impedance @xmath103 in a compact form as @xmath104 where for the simplest bias circuit we have @xmath105 . eq . [ respo ] above has the advantage that if the tes impedance is measured , as is commonly done , the responsivity can be immediately calculated from it .",
    "the effect of the loop gain on the current responsivity is well known , with higher loop gain increasing the responsivity at frequencies below the effective thermal time constant ( where the responsivity starts to roll - off ) , and moving the time constant to higher frequencies .",
    "this takes place regardless of the complexity of the thermal model . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of changing @xmath51 and @xmath52 is not so self - evident . in fig .",
    "[ sploth ] , we plot how @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the two - block thermal circuits affect the responsivity , using the hanging model as an example ( other models behave in a similar manner ) .",
    "we plot only the magnitude @xmath106 , as the phase is irrelevant for noise considerations , which is the focus in this work .",
    "we see from the plots that for the usual case where the electrical cut - off frequency is above the thermal cut - off frequency ( low enough inductance @xmath4 ) , the effect of the extra thermal block is to reduce the responsivity in the mid- frequency range starting from @xmath107 . increasing @xmath51 moves the first partial cut - off set by @xmath107 to lower frequencies [ fig .",

    "some of them are directly associated with superconductivity such as phase - slip shot noise @xcite , fluctuation superconductivity noise @xcite and vortex motion noise @xcite . in all these mechanisms , there are external parameters such as the material quality of the superconducting film or the magnetic field that affect the noise , and thus these superconductivity related noise sources can , in principle , be controlled to some extent .",
    "in addition , there is currently no conclusive evidence for a significant role of the superconducting noise sources being dominant in tes detectors . in this paper",
    "we therefore only concentrate on the two unavoidable noise sources in tes detectors : ( i ) thermodynamic fluctuations of heat within the thermal circuit ( thermal fluctuation noise , tfn ) @xcite , and ( ii ) electrical fluctuations of the resistive circuit elements ( johnson noise ) @xcite .",

    "both @xmath144 and @xmath237 noise components increase monotonously , whereas @xmath238 has a maximum amplitude around @xmath241 , with its cut - off moving to higher frequencies with @xmath240 . also , the shape of the @xmath237 noise changes , with the bump disappearing with high values of @xmath240 .",
    "the johnson noise suppression is strengthened with increasing @xmath240 . the data in fig .",
    "[ noiseih ] ( c ) , is also shown in log - log scale in fig .",
    "[ noiseih ] ( d ) , highlighting how the shunt noise is suppressed more with increasing @xmath240 , similar to the johnson noise . a minimum develops , though , for high values of @xmath240 .",
    "more examples of the ih model , and particularily in combination with analysing real impedance and noise data , are discussed in refs .",
    "we have given here a comprehensive discussion of of all the possible variants of two - block thermal models and their influence on the complex impedance , responsivity and noise of a voltage biased transition edge sensor .",
    "the results were derived analytically , and easy - to - use formulas were provided for impedance , responsivity and noise .",
    "in addition , results for two variants of simple three - block thermal models were derived , as well .",
    "example plots were generated to show how different parameters of the models affect the observables .",
    "in general , a more complex thermal circuit reduces the responsivity and increases the noise at intermediate frequencies , leading thus to performance degradation in terms of the noise equivalent power .",
    "the derived theoretical formulas in their current formulation are mainly meant to be used in the analysis of tes experiments , and excellent agreement was already achieved in fitting real tes detector data @xcite . however , for detector performance optimization one also needs to consider figures of merit such as noise equivalent power , energy resolution , speed and electrothermal stability in more detail .",
    "those performance considerations will be possible in the future for various kinds of tes detectors with more complex thermal circuits , based on the work presented here .",
    "this research was supported by academy of finland project number 128532 and the finnish funding agency for technology and innovation tekes .",
