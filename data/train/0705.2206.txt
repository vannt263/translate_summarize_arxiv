    "nonlinear sigma models are field theories whose elementary fields , or dynamical variables , are maps , @xmath2 , from a space , @xmath3 , the source space , to an auxiliary space , @xmath4 , the target space , endowed with a non - degenerate metric . the lagrangian governing the dynamics of the model measures the total energy of those maps .",
    "the classical solutions of the model , i.  e. , the solutions of the corresponding field equations , constitute the space of field configurations .",
    "the dimension of the source space is called the dimension of the model .",
    "the isometry group , @xmath5 , of the target space is the symmetry of the model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath3 is compact and riemannian , each solution has finite energy . in this sense ,",
    "we call them solitons .    two - dimensional nonlinear sigma models , in particular those with symmetry @xmath1 and @xmath0 , are ubiquitous in physics ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) ; with applications going from condensed - matter physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) to high - energy physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) and , of course , quantum field theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular ,",
    "those with minkowski signature metric on the target space are applied to gauge theories ( see @xcite ) , quantum gravity ( see @xcite ) , string theories ( see @xcite ) , quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) and general relativity , in particular einstein and ernst equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are specially important in string theories where the model description is applicable .",
    "this kind of universality is strongly related to the fact that these sigma models , and the equations governing their dynamics , have a deep underlying geometric meaning .",
    "this provides a powerful reason to explain the great interest of these models in applied mathematics and in differential geometry , even without mentioning any physical terminology , simply as a kind of constrained willmore problem ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in this framework , it seems natural to identify the dynamical variables of the two - dimensional @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model with the gauss maps of surfaces in the three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this approach has been successfully used to obtain certain moduli spaces of solutions : with constant mean curvature , @xcite , those admitting a rotational symmetry , @xcite , and those foliated by villarceau circles , @xcite .",
    "the study of moduli spaces of solutions ( field configurations ) of the two - dimensional @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model constitutes an ambitious program .",
    "we will develop it along a series of articles , starting with this one .",
    "beforehand , it will be useful to remark the following general points related to this model :    * the gauss map of any nondegenerate surface in the three - dimensional lorentz - minkowski space , @xmath6 , is automatically an elementary field of this model .",
    "therefore , the geometrical approach identifies the space of dynamical variables with that of gauss maps of nondegenerate surfaces in @xmath6 .",
    "* on the other hand , the underlying variational problem of this model turns out to be equivalent to the willmore variational problem ( see theorem [ equivalencia ] ) .",
    "this has important consequences : 1 .",
    "the field configurations of this model are nothing but the willmore surfaces in @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   the model is invariant under conformal changes of the metric of @xmath6 .",
    "3 .   since",
    "the willmore functional is essentially the polyakov action , the model can be regarded as a bosonic string theory in @xmath6 that is governed by the willmore - polyakov action . in this sense , the solutions of the model provide the string world sheet configurations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now , the first step in the above program , which constitutes the main aim of this paper , is stated as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * to determine the moduli space of solutions of the two - dimensional @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model that admit a rotational symmetry .",
    "equivalently , classify , up to congruences , those rotational surfaces in @xmath7 that are critical points of the total energy . *",

    "this can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "firstly , we consider the nonlinear sigma model with boundary and we determine the admissible boundary conditions .",
    "2 .   next , we obtain the space of surfaces that are invariant under rotations with time - like axis .",

    "this case is the most complicated .",
    "the first important difficulty is to obtain the whole class of rotational surfaces in @xmath7 with space - like axis , in other words , surfaces that are invariant under a one parameter group , @xmath9 , of hyperbolic motions .",
    "this problem , which has been usually avoided in the literature , perhaps because of its difficulty , is completely solved in section [ superficiesados ] .",
    "to understand this problem , assume that the space - like axis coincides with the @xmath10-axis .",
    "then , the planes @xmath11 and @xmath12 divide @xmath7 in four open regions , which will be called fundamental regions .",
    "certainly , for every fundamental region we can get a class of rotational surfaces , with @xmath10-axis , immersed in the region .",
    "these surfaces are well known in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) . however , there are rotational surfaces with @xmath10-axis in @xmath7 that leave a fundamental region to emerge in another fundamental region .",
    "this family includes popular surfaces , such as a saddle surface and the one - sheet hyperboloid with @xmath13-axis . in some sense",
    ", these surfaces can be obtained by gluing two or more surfaces , each of them contained in a fundamental region . along section [ superficiesados ]",
    ", we use surgery to dissect these surfaces and to understand the gluing mechanism . at the end of it",
    ", we obtain a classification theorem ( see theorem [ lorentzianas - invariantes ] ) and a construction algorithm ( see subsection [ algoritmo ] ) .",
    "once we have obtained the whole space of rotational surfaces with space - like axis , there are , at least , two different ways to get the corresponding solutions . on one hand",
    ", one can try to carry out a symmetry reduction of the action principle .",
    "this procedure depends on a kind of symmetric criticality principle that should be established .",
    "however , there is a second way that consists in a direct variational approach .",
    "therefore , one needs to obtain the field equations governing the model .",
    "since the model turns out to be equivalent to a constricted willmore model , in section [ variacion - will ] , we obtain the first variation that provides willmore surfaces in a general semi - riemannian background .    in section [ ados - r - solutiones ]",

    "in contrast with the riemannian case , we can find lorentzian solutions in all the fundamental regions .",
    "this fact allows us to study the existence of solutions leaving a fundamental region and emerging in another one . in other words ,",
    "we look for solutions obtained by gluing fundamental solutions .",

    "they are known in the literature as rotational surfaces with light - like axis , @xcite .",
    "now , parabolic rotational surfaces lie in two fundamental regions of @xmath7 . in contrast with the case of rotational surfaces with space - like axis , in section [ superficiesatres ] we prove that we can not find parabolic rotational surfaces that leave a fundamental region to emerge in the other . at the end of that section",
