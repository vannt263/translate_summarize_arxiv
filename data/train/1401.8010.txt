    "the role of disorder in spin systems represents a permanent source of challenging problems . for instance ,",
    "random fields ( rfs ) and spin glass ( sg ) models are systems in which a richness of physical properties emerges from the disordered interactions @xcite .",
    "the interplay of these two highly nontrivial manifestations of disorder can be found in physical systems , such as the diluted ising - like antiferromagnets fe@xmath2zn@xmath3f@xmath4 and fe@xmath2mg@xmath3cl@xmath4 @xcite . in special , for fe@xmath2zn@xmath3f@xmath4 , one gets a random field ising model ( rfim ) like behavior for @xmath5 and an ising sg ( isg ) for @xmath6 . for intermediate concentrations ( @xmath7 ) one may observe both behaviors with a crossover between them @xcite .",
    "a more recent example of the interplay comes from disordered cerium systems , as the ceni@xmath3cu@xmath8 alloys ( see @xcite and references there in ) .    from the theoretical point of view , the effects introduced by rfs are complex and nontrivial even for the most studied rf model : the rfim .",
    "the thermodynamic properties introduced by rfs have remained controversial for more than 30 years ( for a recent review in the rfim see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , several studies display broad divergences even for the rfim phase diagram structure @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of rfs on the sg phase has also been investigated @xcite . in this case ,",
    "random bond ( rb ) interaction models with an additional magnetic rf have been considered extensively .",
    "particularly , the studies are mainly accomplished by spin-1/2 models in strong frustrated regimes ( introduced by rb ) .",
    "for example , the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite was combined with rfs following distinct types of disorder . specifically , the sk model with a gaussian rf exhibits phase diagrams , in which the sg phase decreases with the rf , at least in the mean field theory @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that this result was obtained within the one - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( 1s - rsb ) approximation for the sg solution .",
    "however , the effects produced by rfs on phase diagrams for low rb frustrated regimes in spin-1 models are almost unexplored .",
    "besides , disordered spin-1 models ( like the strong frustrated ghatak - sherrington @xcite ( gs ) model ) can exhibit a variety of interesting behaviors even without rf .",
    "for instance , their phase diagrams show a transition line that changes from a continuous phase transition to a first - order transition . actually , the source of this particularity is the average number of non - magnetic states ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "consequently , important unexplored issues concerning the presence of rfs within a low - level of rb frustration in spin-1 models arise . for example",
    ", one can ask how the phase diagrams are changed by the presence of rfs within regimes of low average number of interacting states and low - level of frustration .",
    "therefore , the main goal of the present work is to analyze what kinds of phase transitions and which thermodynamic phases are present with the simultaneous adjustment of the rf , frustration and the presence of non - interacting states .",
    "the model proposed to accomplish this task is the spin-1 hopfield model under a gaussian rf .",
    "different from the usual gs model , the spin-1 hopfield model enables us to control the level of frustration by the hebb interaction .",
    "this provides a way to adjust the system disorder and frustration by means of the parameter @xmath10 varying from trivial disorder to a highly frustrated regime in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to interpolate the thermodynamics from the non frustrated @xmath11 to the strongly frustrated regime @xmath12 . in particular , these analyses",
    "could also be a first attempt to bring helpful information in complex problems as that of cerium disordered compounds .",
    "we perform the thermodynamic analysis using the 1s - rsb mean field theory to obtain the order parameters and phase diagrams for several values of frustration level and anisotropy constant .",
    "in addition , the present work can also shed light on the role of frustration and rf in inverse transitions ( its ) .",
    "for instance , an inverse freezing ( if ) occurs when increasing temperature leads the system from a liquid to a glass phase .",
    "if the increase of temperature leads to crystallization of a liquid , an inverse melting ( i m ) is obtained . in these kinds of phase transitions , the phase that is usually considered",
    "the most ordered has more entropy than the disordered one .",
    "the current interest in studying its is justified since it has been observed in various physical systems , as high-@xmath13 superconductors and many others @xcite .",
    "moreover , the knowledge about which conditions are necessary for the occurrence of it is a challenging issue @xcite .",
    "actually , several models have been used to study its , in particular , the magnetic ones because of their simplicity @xcite . from those magnetic models",
    ", it is suggested that disorder from rb would be a key ingredient to produce its @xcite . on the other hand , although several works discuss the role of the rf in the it problem @xcite , it is still an open issue whether or not other forms of disorder can contribute to produce its .",
    "therefore , in the present work , a more detailed analysis of the role of rb and rf in its is performed .",

    "[ eq2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "however , before going into details of phase diagrams with combined effects of disorder , a summary of the results for special situations are presented .",
    "for instance , it is known that the spin-1 hopfield model in absence of rfs ( @xmath84 ) exhibits a rs phase diagram in which the fe phase , as well both the fe / sg phase transition and the freezing temperature @xmath85 decrease as the fraction of nonmagnetic sites @xmath17 increases @xcite . this behavior is also observed in our 1s - rsb results presented in the inset of [ fig1](a ) . on other hand , when @xmath86 the behavior of the spin-1/2 hopfield model is recovered . in this case , the increase of @xmath83 can reduce both the sg and fe phases , where fe / sg transition disappears for a critical value of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "another important limit is @xmath37 , in which the results for the high frustrated sk @xmath18-type interactions can be obtained @xcite . in particular",
    ", one can reproduce the gs phase diagrams ( see references @xcite ) .    however , the simultaneous presence of both disorders in low frustrated regimes of the spin-1 hopfield model produces even more interesting results .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) exhibits the case with @xmath84 , where the sg / pm critical frontier @xmath85 increases with the parameter @xmath1 . for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "a first order sg / fe phase transition line @xmath87 is also found as the temperature diminishes .",
    "particularly , the @xmath87 corresponds to the limit of the global stable fe solution .",

    "mostly important , a direct first order line transition appears between the pm and fe phases for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it indicates that the rf affects the fe and sg phase boundaries differently as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b)-(e ) .",
    "the @xmath11 case shows for small @xmath71 a continuous ( second order ) phase transition ( called @xmath90 ) between fe and pm phases .",

    "the increase of @xmath1 produces a more complex scenario with arising of the sg phase .",
    "furthermore , different from the fe phase , the sg one is not completely suppressed by the rf .",
    "for instance , the @xmath85 decreases monotonically as @xmath71 increases .",
    "in addition , the nature of the fe phase boundary is changed from continuous to first order ( see fig .",

    "1 , the @xmath1 and rf can completely suppress the fe state .",
    "on the contrary , it is observed that the parameter @xmath1 favors the sg phase , while the rfs undermine it .",
    "the effects on the phase boundaries coming from tuning @xmath17 are analyzed in more detail in fig .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) exhibits the case where only trivial disorder is present ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) . for low @xmath73",

    "[ fig2](b ) displays a phase diagram where nontrivial disorder is also present ( @xmath94 and @xmath92 ) . in this case , the intensity of @xmath83 is high enough to prevent the occurrence of sg phase at @xmath95 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , the first order pm / fe phase transition is replaced by a continuous pm / sg transition when @xmath17 increases , where the sg phase appears for @xmath96 . from figs .",
    "[ fig2](c)-(d ) , it is observed a smooth decreasing of @xmath85 which can appear at larger values of @xmath73 when the rf is present ( see insets for comparison ) .",

    "it does not appear for the @xmath11 case or when @xmath1 is high enough .",
    "the additional disorder coming from the rf tends to suppress the @xmath97 .",
    "it is also important to remark that the first order boundaries from previous results are located by comparing the free energies , where the `` stable '' phase is that one with lower free energy . in this case",
    ", it should be emphasized that the location of the first - order transitions is not very dependent on the rsb scheme @xcite . in particular , the increase of @xmath17 results in a reentrant first order sg / pm phase boundary whenever frustration is present .",
    "this reentrant behavior can be an indication of inverse freezing ( if ) .",
    "on the other hand , no reentrant behavior is found in the fe / pm phase boundaries , which means absence of inverse melting ( i m ) @xcite . to clarify these points , a detailed analysis of the entropy and behavior of the average number of non - magnetic states @xmath82",
    "is displayed in fig .",

    "finally , fig .",
    "3(b ) shows the entropy behavior for @xmath11 as @xmath71 increases .",
    "this result indicates that the rf increases the entropy of both fe and pm phases . as a consequence ,",
    "no i m can be found too .",
    "the behavior of the average number of non magnetic sites @xmath82 as a function of @xmath73 for @xmath98 and several values of @xmath10 and @xmath71 are shown in figs 3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "the limits @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be related to the interacting and the no interacting regimes , respectively .",
    "the effects of @xmath1 on @xmath82 in the fe , sg and pm phases are shown in fig .",
    "for instance , @xmath82 presents a small increase with @xmath1 in the fe phase .",
    "in addition , @xmath82 increases to an intermediate value when the sg phase appears for @xmath101 . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath82 in the pm phase for larger @xmath73 remains unaltered . as a consequence",
    "the entropy of this pm phase remains low even for higher values of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "3(c ) the disorder related to the rf is increased .",
    "it should be remarked that the effects of @xmath71 on @xmath82 differ from those obtained by increasing @xmath1 . in particular , @xmath82 in low temperature pm phase presents a clear decreasing as @xmath71 increases .",
    "this result shows that the rf disfavors non - interacting states in this pm phase . in that sense ,",
    "the rf increases the entropy of the pm phase at a lower temperature .",
    "therefore , it tends to suppress the reentrance in the sg / pm phase boundary .",
    "the effect of tuning @xmath1 and @xmath83 on the entropy and the @xmath82 are analyzed in fig .",
    "4 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) the entropy of the fe , sg and pm phases increase with the rf .",
    "however , the increase of the sg entropy is less pronounced than those observed in the fe and pm phases . particularly , fig .",
    "4(b ) indicates that the @xmath82 remains at intermediate values even for larger values of @xmath73 .",
    "it occurs because the rf couples with the interacting spin states . as a consequence",
    ", the sg phase appears for larger @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , @xmath82 of the sg phase does not present a significant increasing with the rf .",
    "such behavior of the @xmath82 could be the reason for the sg entropy to present only a very small increase with @xmath71 .",
    "the present work studied the spin-1 hopfield model under a gaussian random field ( rf ) .",
    "this study was carried out within the 1s - rsb scheme using a mean field approximation .",
    "the proposed approach allows to explore the relation between frustration ( related to the rb disorder ) and random field in the presence of noninteracting states ( coming from the crystal field @xmath17 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "new information concerning the physical properties related to the interplay of the mentioned effects can be obtained .    in our model",
    ", the degree of frustration and the rf disorder are controlled by tuning @xmath10 and @xmath83 , where the last one is associated to the variance of gaussian rf .",
    "for very low values of @xmath83 the rb dominates and one can find fe or sg phase depending on the frustration level . on the other hand , for very high values of @xmath83 the rf dominates and both fe and sg phases are suppressed within the 1s - rsb scheme .",
    "the increasing of @xmath1 produces a complex scenario with arising of the sg phase and fe phase suppression .",
    "in fact , while the fe phase disappears quickly by introducing disorder coming from both rb and rf , the sg is reinforced by increasing the frustration level and it is monotonically suppressed by increasing @xmath83 .    a raise in the number of noninteracting states @xmath9 by tuning the crystal field @xmath17 increases the complexity of the thermodynamics obtained from the proposed model .",
    "for instance , the fe phase is intensively affected by the crystal field , since the occupation of interacting states is fundamental in defining the orientation of spins .",
    "particularly , the fe phase is suppressed by increasing @xmath73 . moreover , in the presence of frustration , the fe phase can be replaced by a sg phase even without rf . however , the changes produced by the interplay of the rb , rf and @xmath17 are far from trivial .",
    "deep changes can occur in the structure of the phase diagrams depending on the combination of the mentioned parameters .",
    "the most notable consequence occurs at sufficiently low frustration levels . in such cases ,",
    "no sg phase can be found in the presence of rf when there are a few number of @xmath9 states . due to the competing effects between the rf ( coupling with interacting states ) and @xmath17 ( favoring @xmath9 states )",
    "the sg phase can appear at large d. although this sg phase appears , higher @xmath73 values still suppress the sg phase by increasing the number of @xmath9 states .",
    "finally , another goal is to respond whether a complex form of disorder , the nontrivial one defined by the presence of frustration , is an essential ingredient to produce inverse transitions ( its ) . for finite @xmath1",
    ", we can superpose this disorder with effects coming from the gaussian rf .",
    "this procedure allows to probe the role of both rf and frustration on its . from our results",
    "it is shown that only nontrivial disorder can cause its even for very low level of frustration . moreover , at lower temperature , our results clearly display that the main effect of nontrivial disorder is to increase the entropy of the ordered phases , particularly , of the sg one .",
