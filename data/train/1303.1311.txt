    "the issue of unifying both classical and quantum cosmology is an open challenge of modern physics partially due to the lack of a self - consistent quantum gravity theory .",
    "all the attempts aimed to achieve a quantum gravity theoretical scheme lead to many inconsistencies and it is furthermore not clear how to measure quantum signatures in the context of observational cosmology @xcite . recently , the evidence of cosmic positive acceleration , reported by several observational surveys @xcite , has open further interrogatives , due to the ignorance of the physical nature of the fluid responsible for the cosmic speed up .",
    "the standard framework leads to the existence of a vacuum energy cosmological constant @xmath2 , characterized by a negative equation of state @xcite .",
    "even though the cosmological constant allows the cosmic acceleration at late times , the observational bounds on @xmath2 are incompatible with theoretical predictions of a gravitational vacuum state .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2 and matter order of magnitude are surprisingly close to each other , although @xmath2 is supposed to be constant along the universe evolution . these two thorny shortcomings , namely the _ fine tuning _ and the _ coincidence _ problems , disturb the otherwise appealing picture of a cosmological constant and dramatically plague the so called @xmath2cdm model @xcite .",
    "a way out for the above problems is to extend the standard @xmath2 paradigm by postulating the existence of a new ingredient referred to as _",
    "dark energy_. it provides a fluid with an evolving negative equation of state .",
    "a solution is that quantum effects at fundamental level could be responsible for the existence of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the possibility to relate dark energy with quantum effects has been recently considered by dealing with the existence of a hidden mechanism behind the nature of the cosmological constant as a result of entanglement between cosmological eras @xcite . in doing so",
    ", the existence of entangled states was postulated , showing that a running cosmological constant is compatible with early times of the universe evolution , while , at late times , the cosmological constant is recovered as a limiting case .",
    "such a result can be achieved also in the framework of alternative theories of gravity @xcite . a key role for this approach",
    "is played by quantum information that reached a growing interest during last decades spanning from condensed matter to cosmology @xcite .",
    "moreover , relevant entanglement phenomena have been framed into robust theoretical schemes and verified through several experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , selection criteria were sought in order to characterize the entanglement amount of quantum states .",
    "all of those criteria are essentially based on equivalent forms of non - locality of pure quantum states . in addition , since entanglement can be considered as a fundamental quantity , its physical meaning has been compared with quantities like energy and entropy .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold : we first wonder whether it is possible to consider cosmic dark energy as the result of an entanglement mechanism between two or more than two cosmological eras during the universe evolution .",
    "secondly , we show that the corresponding equation of states , derived by the entanglement process , is compatible with the late time universe evolution as a running barotropic fluid equation of state .",
    "this approach is justified assuming the entanglement mechanism applicable to the degrees of freedom of macroscopic systems , in this case , the whole observed universe .",
    "the latter process is known in the literature as decoherence @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the challenge of finding decoherence effects in the cosmological scenario is related to the interaction between qubits with their environment @xcite . in particular , quantum coherence and entanglement of the quantum states",
    "can lead to _ more decoherence _ if the number of qubits increases @xcite .    in this paper , under the hypothesis that the decoherence effects could be related to dark energy , we show that it is possible to associate the von neumann entropy , as a naive selection criterium , to the fluid accelerating the universe . choosing the simplest case in which the dark energy represents the measurement of decoherence in the observable universe ,",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to infer a cosmological model which predicts the dark energy effects without introducing a vacuum energy cosmological constant term at late times .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the thermodynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic universe in the context of entanglement . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the cosmological models derived by considering the entanglement decoherence as a source for dark energy . in sec .",
    "iv , we draw the conclusions and discuss the perspectives of the present approach .",
    "let us summarize the main features of entanglement between cosmological eras from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "we pay particular attention to the relation of entanglement effects with thermodynamics of the observable universe . in doing so , it is prominent to start by taking into account an @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space whose probability of finding an observable is @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the particular case in which only one of the @xmath6 is different from zero corresponds to a pure quantum state .",

    ", we have @xmath10 with the conditions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 if the state is pure , @xmath15 otherwise @xcite . in the case of non - pure state , the generalization of eq .",

    "the corresponding cosmological models fairly well approximate the cosmological behavior at our time , showing that the existence of a cosmological constant appears as the limiting case of a more complicate dynamics .",
