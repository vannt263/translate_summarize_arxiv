    "pks 2005 - 489 is one of the brightest high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbl ) in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it is located at @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite and has a redshift of @xmath2 @xcite . in 2004 ,",
    "the first very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath3-rays have been detected from pks 2005 - 489 by the cherenkov telescope array h.e.s.s .",
    "and the resulting @xmath3-ray spectrum was the softest tev spectrum ever measured @xcite . in multi - year studies , pks 2005 - 489",
    "show large flux and spectral variations in the x - ray regime , while only weak variation in the vhe band have been detected ( e.g. @xcite ) . therefore simultaneous observations over a broad wavelength range are necessary to investigate the nature of the underlying emission processes .",
    "+   + a complex broadband multi - wavelength campaign on pks 2005 - 489 was organized by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration and was conducted from 22 may to 2 july 2009 with observations by the cherenkov telescope array h.e.s.s . , the x - ray satellites rxte and swift and the optical 75 cm telescope atom . the lat instrument onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope is scanning the whole sky within approximately 3 hours and therefore pks 2005 - 489 was regularly monitored during this campaign .",
    "therefore simultaneous information about the brightness and the spectrum of the gev @xmath3-ray emission could be obtained .",

    "experiment consists of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , located in the khomas highland , namibia @xcite .",
    "the observations on pks 2005 - 489 have been taken from 22 may to 2 july 2009 with a break over full moon because the cherenkov telescopes can not observe during moontime .",
    "the data have been calibrated as described in @xcite and analysed using the _ standard cuts _ and following the method described in @xcite .",

    "method @xcite was used to determine an appropriate background for the spectrum .",
    "an independent analysis has been performed on the same data , but with different calibration , resulting in compatible results .",
    "no significant variation of the very high energy emission is measured on nightly binning during this campaign and a mean flux of @xmath5 can be determined .",
    "considering the two months of observations each , also no variability could be detected on month time scales .",

    "the data were analyzed using the standard likelihood tools distributed with the science tools v9r15p3 package available from fermi science support center . only events having the highest probability of being photons , those in the `` diffuse '' class , were used . to limit contamination by earth albedo gamma rays which are produced by cosmic rays interacting with the upper atmosphere , only events with zenith angles @xmath7 were selected .",
    "time intervals during which the rocking angle was larger than @xmath8 were excluded since the earth s limb was in the field of view .",
    "events with energy between 200 mev and 300 gev , and within a @xmath9 region of interest ( roi ) centered on pks 2005 - 489 were analyzed with an unbinned maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the background emission was modeled using a standard galactic diffuse emission model and an isotropic component .",
    "point sources within the roi were also included in the model .",
    "the fluxes were determined using the post - launch instrument response functions p6_v3_diffuse . a point source is detected with high statistical significance at more than 20 standard deviations . the best - fit position ( 20h09m25.0s , @xmath10 4944.4  )",
    "has a @xmath11 containment radius of 1.5 and is statistically consistent with the coordinates of pks 2005 - 489 . the observations of fermi / lat on pks 2005 - 489 during this campaign show no significant variation and can be described by a mean flux of @xmath12 . due to the rather faint gev emission ,",
    "the binning of the lightcurve for the time of this campaign was choosen to be 10 days .",
    "x - ray observations with the pca detector onboard rxte @xcite have been obtained in the energy range @xmath13 strictly simultaneous to the h.e.s.s .",

    "the faint background model provided by the rxte gof was used to generate the background spectrum with pcabackest and the response matrices were created with pcarsp .",
    "spectra of the swift data in pc - mode have been extracted with xselect from an annulus region with an outer radius of @xmath17 at the position of pks 2005 - 489 , which contains @xmath18 of the psf at 1.5 kev and an inner radius of @xmath19 to avoid the pileup .",
    "an appropriate background was extracted from a circular region nearby the source with radius of @xmath20 .",
    "for the wt - mode , appropriate boxes ( @xmath21 ) around the region with source photons and a background region with similar size was used to extract the spectra .",
    "the auxiliary response files were created with xrtmkarf and the response matrices were taken from the swift package of the calibration database caldb . to determine the flux in the energy range 2 - 10 kev , a power law model taking into account the galactic absorption of @xmath22 ( lab survey , @xcite ) was fitted to the rxte and swift spectra .",
    "no significant change in spectral shape was found over the time of the campaign .",
    "slight variations could be seen in the measured flux with an increase at the beginning of the campaign with a following constant flux level over days and a slight decrease at the end of the campaign .",
    "the high x - ray flux of pks 2005 - 489 is comparable to the historical maximum of 1998 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .      the uvot instrument @xcite onboard swift measured strictly simultaneous to the x - ray telescope the uv and optical emission in the bands u ( 345 nm ) , uvw1 ( 251 nm ) and uvw2 ( 188 nm ) with an exposure of @xmath23 ks each .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes and the corresponding flux are calculated with uvotmaghist taking into account all photons from a circular region with radius @xmath24 ( standard aperture for all filters ) .",
    "an appropriate background was determined from a circular region with radius @xmath25 near the source region without contamination of sources .",
    "the 75-cm telescope atom @xcite , located at the h.e.s.s . site in namibia , monitored the flux in the 4 different filters b ( 440 nm ) , v ( 550 nm ) , r ( 640 nm ) and i ( 790 nm ) .",
    "the obtained data have been analysed with the program midas using differential photometry with closeby reference stars to determine the absolute magnitudes . at the beginning of the campaign pks 2005",
    "- 489 was in a high state and during the campaign the optical flux decreased by @xmath26 .",
    "regular monitoring by atom and the optical telescope rotse show that pks 2005 - 489 has a long - term variation of the time scale of years .",
    "the monitoring data by rotse also shows that the flux in 2009 is the highest flux since 2005 . since the maximum in 2005 , the source flux decreased over @xmath27 years with a slow increase in the following years , until 2009 , back to the flux level of 2005 .",
