    "in recent years impressive progress has been achieved in fabricating , functionalizing and controlling molecular junctions for charge transfer [ ] and as nano - machines [ ] .",
    "this includes advanced techniques to link molecular structures to metallic electrodes and gates , to design molecular rectifiers or to induce rotary molecular motion .",
    "particularly fascinating is the interplay of charge transfer and conformational dynamics .",
    "theoretically , density functional calculations ( dft ) in combination with non - equilibrium greens function techniques as well as model based descriptions in terms of master equations have elucidated fundamental aspects of single molecule contacts .",
    "a particular challenge is to capture electromechanical properties of these devices where injected charges drive internal molecular degrees of freedom such as vibrational or rotational modes far from equilibrium which in turn back - act on the transport channels .",
    "a well - established procedure is to determine energy surfaces for these modes from the conformation of the molecular backbone in or at least very close to equilibrium .",
    "since couplings between molecules and electrodes are typically weak and relevant intra - molecular excitations are fast compared to displacements of the skeleton of the entire structure , this approach has been successfully applied to explain a variety of experimental observations [ ] .",
    "what happens , however , far from equilibrium is much less understood .    to address this issue we consider in this paper a minimal system consisting of a conjugated organic molecule with two sub - units the relative orientation of which determines its transfer properties when contacted to electrodes .",
    "a typical realization is e.g.  a biphenyl compound with the dihedral angle between the two benzene rings acting as conformational degree of freedom .",
    "this set - up has received considerable attention in recent experiments , see e.g.  [ ] . so far , however , only situations close to equilibrium ( low voltage regime ) and for very weak electrode - molecule couplings have been addressed .",
    "theoretical work has revealed the role of vibrational excitations [ ] and dynamical symmetry breaking [ ] within master equation approaches . for compounds with fixed torsion mode dft calculations",
    "apply to show microscopic details of conductance properties [ ] .    here",
    "we focus on the complementary regime of strong non - equilibrium with a rotational mode that is not frozen , but may approach a voltage dependent optimal configuration in steady state .",
    "this scenario requires electrode - molecule couplings large compared to vibrational but small compared to electronic excitations on the molecule ( details are given below ) .",
    "then , a born - oppenheimer approximation ( bo ) applies which provides voltage dependent energy surfaces .",
    "notably , stable molecular conformations can be controlled by bias and gate voltage which are directly related to a robust quantization of current transfer .",
    "this opens the possibility for realizations of molecular machines [ ] as e.g. switches and valves .    for charge transfer through molecular contacts bos in steady state",
    "have been discussed previously in several contexts . in [ ] a type of self - consistent treatment for a contact with a single electronic level coupled to single harmonic intramolecular degree of freedom revealed the appearance of hysteresis and negative differential conductance .",
    "greens functions methods have been used in conjunction with a bo to extract effective potential surfaces for nearly harmonic vibronic modes in [ ] .",
    "however , both treatments exploit that the driven dynamics of an _ harmonic _ oscillator is analytically known . instead , in the sequel",
    "a methodology for substantial anharmonicity of intramolecular modes and/or coulomb interaction between excess charges on several molecular electronic levels is studied .",
    "the biphenyl molecule ( fig .  [ sketch ] ) consists of two benzene rings which can be twisted by an angle @xmath0 .",
    "each of the rings may carry one excess electron and the tunnel coupling between left ring ( l ) and right ring ( r ) depends on this torsion angle as the dominant intramolecular mode with respect to transport properties .",
    "the total molecule hamiltonian then reads [ ] @xmath1 where the first line describes the dynamics of the torsion angle and tunneling between the rings , i.e. , @xmath2 and the second line captures the charging energy @xmath3 for individual excess charges on the molecule and the coulomb repulsion @xmath4 for double occupancy , respectively . following microscopic calculations [ ]",
    "we also incorporate a stark energy shift @xmath5 of the molecular sites due to an external electric field .",
    "it turns out that this stark shift has substantial impact on the molecular conformation and transport properties .",
    "further we have the local electron densities @xmath6 , where operators @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) create excess electrons on the left ( right ) subunit .",
    "crucial for the charge transfer across this structure is the separation of energy scales with a small height @xmath9 for the rotational barrier of the neutral molecule , a large hopping element @xmath10 , and a large inertial moment @xmath11 [ ] .",
    "as it is typical for conjugated organic molecules , orbitals are thus delocalized throughout the molecular backbone .",
    "accordingly , it is appropriate to introduce the molecule s charge energy eigenstates as linear combinations of the left and right localized states : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath14 $ ] depends on the torsional degree of freedom @xmath15 with the eigenenergies of the one - electron hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "as one can see , for vanishing stark shift , we have @xmath17 ( the sign of @xmath18 jumps at @xmath19 where the hopping matrix elemnt crosses zero ) and the energy eigenstates become the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of localized states , which couple symmetrically ( except for a sign ) to the right and left leads . for large stark shift",
    "we instead get @xmath20 and the eigenstates become the localized ones that only couple to a single lead each .    in eigenstate representation",
    "the molecule hamiltonian is @xmath21 here , @xmath22 denotes the neutral molecule , @xmath23 the two one - particle eigenstates , and @xmath24 is the doubly occupied state .",
    "the torsional dependent energies of these states are given by : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the molecular junction is now modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath28 with @xmath29 describing left ( l ) and right ( r ) lead , respectively , as reservoirs of non - interacting quasi - particles with creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath32 are fixed by the bias voltage @xmath33 and the gate voltage @xmath34 . the stark - shift varies with the bias according to @xmath35 with a parameter @xmath36 .",
    "coupling of the left ( right ) lead to the left ( right ) ring is described by @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "charge transfer into / out of the molecule is determined by rates @xmath39 where electrodes are taken in the wide band limit with a density of states @xmath40 .",
    "apparently , the coupling of the molecular states depends on the mixing angle @xmath18 which itself depends sensitively on the stark - field according to ( [ thetaphi ] ) .",
    "for instance , the coupling of the @xmath41 state to the left ( right ) lead is given by @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ coupfig ] , for @xmath43 these couplings are identical only for vanishing electric field , i.e.  @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for finite values of @xmath5",
    "this symmetry is immediately broken , e.g.   around @xmath46 with small deviations @xmath47 , one has @xmath48 so that @xmath49 .    in the remainder",
    "we are particularly interested in the steady state current @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number operator in lead @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the density operator of the junction . with electrodes residing in thermal equilibrium the reduced density operator",
    "@xmath54 provides the relevant transport information .",
    "a standard procedure is to derive from the liouville - von neuman equation @xmath55 $ ] a master equation by treating @xmath56 as a perturbation ( weak coupling ) . this way , upon employing the usual born - markov approximation one arrives at @xmath57+\\hat{r}\\rho(t)$ ] with the redfield tensor [ ] @xmath58\\ , .",
    "\\label{redfield}\\ ] ] positively definite steady - state solutions are only obtained if a secular approximation is applied to ( [ redfield ] ) so that couplings between populations ( diagonal elements ) and coherences ( off - diagonal elements ) of _ non - degenerate _ states are dropped [ ] . the corresponding redfield tensor @xmath59 determines the steady state density due to @xmath60 .",

    "for low voltages ( @xmath64 ) and very weak couplings , transport properties are restricted to the low energy sector .",
    "thus a representation of @xmath65 in the basis @xmath66 is appropriate , with vibrational modes @xmath67 probing only the vicinity of @xmath68 on surfaces @xmath69 , respectively [ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ eeff ] ) .    in regime of higher voltages",
    ", however , this scheme poses severe difficulties . on surfaces @xmath70",
    "the density of torsional eigenstates ( typical level spacings @xmath71 ) strongly increases such that they should more accurately be described in terms of coherent states .",
    "this necessitates the inclusion of coherences in ( [ redfield ] ) also for _ non - degenerate _ eigenstates which typically leads to negative populations and thus to a breakdown of the perturbative treatment .",
    "a separation of time scales between the sluggish motion of the dihedral angle and a faster charge transfer through the contact suggests an alternative approach though which avoids this deficiency . in the spirit of a bo one first calculates steady - state solutions @xmath72 for the electronic system at any _ fixed _ value of the rotational angle and then uses this solution to extract an effective steady - state potential for the torsional mode . within the basis @xmath73 and for",

[ iphifig ] )    eventually , the schrdinger equation for the torsional degree of freedom with the effective potential ( [ veff ] ) is solved providing eigenfunctions @xmath90 and energies @xmath91 .",
    "note that these depend on the electronic steady state of the junction and thus on bias and gate voltage as well as temperature .",
    "angle - averaged expectation values of observables @xmath92 are obtained from @xmath93 .",
    "a thermal equilibrium state of the _ torsional _ sector is not in conflict with steady - state solutions of the _ electronic _ sector far from equilibrium due to the coupling of the former one to a heat bath environment of residual vibronic modes .",

    "[ iphifig ] ) .",
    "finite angle - averaged currents @xmath98 result from sufficient overlap of angle dependent currents ( [ ieq2 ] ) with these states .",
    "before we proceed , let us specify the constraints for the above scenario .",
    "it is based on a time scale separation between electronic passage through the molecule and torsional motion ( adiabaticity ) and on a separation between electronic transition energies and electrode - molecule couplings @xmath99 ( perturbation theory ) .",
    "specifically , this means @xmath100 which should be accessible in experimental set - ups due to @xmath101 .",
    "let us now discuss the steady state properties in more detail .",
    "we start with the case of a vanishing intramolecular field @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ phifig ] ( bottom ) the twist angle displays stability plateaus which reveal conformational changes with increasing bias and gate voltage , respectively . in a central diamond ( low bias voltage , @xmath103 ) the molecule resides in an almost planar configuration ( @xmath104 ) , while outside it is found mainly out of plane with @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "one additional plateau appears with @xmath107 when four transition channels are accessible : @xmath108 .",
    "this step - wise snapping leaves its imprint on the current as seen in figs .",
    "[ phifig ] ( top ) and [ currentcut ] .",
    "according to ( [ ieq2 ] ) and ( [ rates ] ) transport channels open when @xmath96 exceeds transition energies between molecular states which lie in the conduction window determined by @xmath34 .",
    "the current exhibits distinct plateaus with @xmath109 which can be individually activated by the gate voltage .",
    "an asymmetric response to @xmath34 is also seen with a central coulomb diamond shifted towards positive voltages [ ] .    in realistic junctions",
    "the presence of an intramolecular field ( according to [ ] we set @xmath110 ) breaks the symmetry , thus opening a gap between the @xmath111 and the @xmath112 surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ eeff ] ) and decreasing the homo ( @xmath113)lumo ( @xmath112 ) separation [ ] . while for the mean twist angle and the net current ( fig .",
    "[ phistarkfig ] ) the general appearance of the central diamond survives , new wedge - like structures appear with @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 due to @xmath116 .",
    "namely , for finite stark shifts the effective coupling between the leads and the one - particle eigenstates becomes highly asymmetrical and peaked near @xmath94 .",
    "this effect is surprisingly robust and dominates the conduction properties even at very low internal fields ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the fully symmetric situation for @xmath44 turns thus out to be extremely unstable and not applicable to actual junctions .",
    "a cut through the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane at a fixed bias voltage ( fig .",
    "[ cut ] ) reveals the details of the opening and closing of transitions between molecular states upon sweeping @xmath34 from negative to positive values and the simultaneous snapping of the dihedral angle .",
    "in contrast , previous treatments where the torsion angle is considered to be fixed [ ] provide conductances @xmath118 . here",
    ", transitions between current plateaus occur rather abruptly with simultaneous switchings of the molecular backbone .",
    "notably , this behavior is very insensitive to temperature fluctuations ; the system showed just the same plateaus ( albeit slightly rounded ) for @xmath119 .",
    "of particular interest are sequences @xmath120 in the regime @xmath121 with substantial conformational changes @xmath122 .",
    "this could be exploited as a molecular switch ( current on / off ) with the benefit of being insensitive against variations of temperature and internal fields in contrast to alternative proposals . in another application",
    "the voltage dependence of the molecular conformation could be used by operating the biphenyl as a molecular motor [ ] .",
    "more specifically , in a first version a slowly varying time periodic gate voltage at a fixed bias voltage induces a valve - like behavior ( e.g.  open for @xmath68 , closed for @xmath94 ) .",
    "the state of the rotor is directly read off from the variations of the dc - current . in an extended set - up side - groups",
    "are attached to each of the biphenyl rings to break in an additional static electric field the @xmath123-symmetry . a time - dependent gate voltage",
    "may then generate left- resp .",
    "right - handed rotations of the individual rings . this situation will be explored in a subsequent work .",
    "we have analyzed charge transfer through conjugated organic molecules contacted to metallic electrodes where a single sluggish vibrational degree of freedom strongly couples to excess charges . in the regime of higher voltages and molecule - electrode couplings",
    "large compared to vibrational excitations , but small compared to intramolecular electronic level spacings , voltage dependent energy surfaces are determined .",
    "bias and gate voltage allow to activate current plateaus that correspond to specific molecular conformations under steady state conditions .",
