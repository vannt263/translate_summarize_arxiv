    "one of the major achievements of nuclear structure studies in the last ten years is the consolidation of the validity of the non relativistic many - body approach .",
    "the idea is to describe the nucleus with a hamiltonian of the type : @xmath6 where the two- and three - body interactions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , are fixed to reproduce the properties of the two- and three - body nuclear systems .",
    "the schrdinger equation has been solved without approximations for few body systems @xcite and light nuclei @xcite , up to a=12 @xcite .",
    "the obtained results provide good descriptions , not only of the energies of these nuclei , but also of other observables .",
    "the difficulties in extending to medium and heavy nuclei the techniques used in few body systems and light nuclei , favored the development of models , and of effective theories .",
    "the basic idea of the effective theories is to work in a restricted space of the many - body wave functions .",
    "usually , one works with many - body wave functions which are slater determinants of single particle wave functions .",
    "the idea of single particle wave functions implies the hypothesis of a mean - field where each nucleon move independently from the other ones . this independent particle model ( ipm )",
    "is quite far from the picture outlined by the microscopic calculations quoted above , describing the nucleus as a many - body system of strongly interacting nucleons . in the hartree - fock theory , which provides the microscopic foundation of the ipm ,",
    "the hamiltonian is not any more that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , but it is an effective hamiltonian built to take into account , obviously in an effective manner , the many - body effects that the microscopic calculations explicitly consider .",
    "the construction of effective interactions starting from the microscopic ones , covers a wide page of the nuclear physics history , starting from the brueckner g - matrix effective interactions @xcite , up to the recent @xmath9 interaction @xcite and the interaction obtained by applying the unitary correlation operator method @xcite .",
    "the application of the ipm is quite successful , but there are evidences of the intrinsic limitations in its applicability .",
    "for example , the measured spectroscopic factors are systematically smaller than one @xcite , which is the value predicted by the ipm .",
    "the ( e , ep ) cross sections in the quasi - elastic region need a consistent reduction of the ipm hole strength to be explained @xcite .",
    "the same holds for the electromagnetic form factors of the low - lying states , especially those having large angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the emission of two like nucleons in photon and electron scattering process can not be described by the ipm @xcite .",
    "also the charge density distributions extracted by elastic electron scattering data are , in the nuclear interior , smaller than those predicted by the ipm @xcite .",
    "these examples indicate the presence of physics effects , commonly called correlations , which are not described by the ipm .",
    "it is common practice to distinguish between long- and short - range correlations since they have different physical sources .",
    "the long - range correlations are related to collective excitations of the system , such as the giant resonances .",
    "the short - range correlations ( src ) are instead connected to the strongly repulsive core of the microscopic nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the repulsive core reduces the possibility that two nucleons can approach each other , and this modifies the ipm picture where , by definition , the motion of each nucleon does not depend on the presence of the other ones .    even though most of the calculations of medium heavy nuclei are based on the ipm , and on the effective theories , various techniques , aiming to attack the problem by using the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ,",

    "we used two - body interactions of argonne and urbana type , and we considered all the interaction channels up to the spin - orbit ones . together with these two - body interactions , we used the appropriated three - body forces of urbana type .",

    "]    the general behavior of the momentum distributions , is very similar for all the nuclei we have considered .",
    "correlated and ipm distributions almost coincide in the low momentum region up to a precise value , when they start to deviate .",
    "the correlated distributions show high momentum tails , which are orders of magnitude larger than the ipm results .",
    "the value of @xmath64 where uncorrelated and correlated momentum distributions start to deviate , is smaller the heavier is the nucleus .",
    "it is about 1.9 @xmath65 for @xmath0c , and 1.5 @xmath65 for @xmath4pb .",
    "we notice that the value of the fermi momentum of symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density is 1.36 @xmath65 .",
    "the results presented in fig . [ fig : md ] clearly show that the effects of the scalar correlations are smaller than those obtained by including the operator dependent terms .",
    "we shall see in the following that this is a common feature of our results .",

    "this quantity , multiplied by a factor @xmath66 , is the probability of finding a proton with momentum @xmath64 .",
    "we observe that the effects of the src on the quantity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdlin ] are basically two .",
    "the first one is the already mentioned enhancement at large values of @xmath64 .",
    "this effect is less evident here than in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] . the second effect , hardly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] , is a reduction of the maxima which appear approximately at @xmath64=1 @xmath65 in both nuclei .",
    "these two effects are obviously related , since all the momentum distributions are normalized as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nor ] ) , therefore reductions and increases must compensate .",
    "we found that the proton and neutron momentum distributions for nuclei with @xmath67 are very similar .",

    "the thicker lines show the results of our fhnc / soc calculation , the thinner lines the ipm momentum distributions .",
    "the figure shows that , in our calculations , the differences between protons and neutrons momentum distributions are more related to the different single particle structure than to the correlation effects .",
    "the main differences in the two distributions is in the zone where the @xmath39 values drops of orders of magnitudes .",
    "this corresponds to the discontinuity region of the momentum distribution in the infinite systems , which is related to the fermi momentum . in a finite system",
    ", the larger number of neutrons implies that the neutron fermi energy is larger than that of the protons , and , consequently , the effective fermi momentum .",
    "for this reason , the neutrons momentum distributions drops at larger values of @xmath64 than the proton distributions . in the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdpn ] , we show the quantity @xmath68 where @xmath69 indicates the uncorrelated momentum distribution .",
    "this quantity is useful to point out the effects of correlations .",
    "we see that in the low @xmath64 region @xmath70 is almost zero . after the discontinuity region @xmath70 reaches an almost constant value around minus one .",
    "this behavior indicates that in the low @xmath64 region the momentum distribution is dominated by single particle dynamics .",
    "the differences between protons and neutrons at low @xmath64 are due to different single particle wave functions . in the higher @xmath64 region",
    "the correlation plays an important role .",
    "we observe that protons and neutrons @xmath70 are very similar , and this indicate that the effect of the src is essentially the same for both kinds of nucleons .",

    "there is however a disagreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where , always in asymmetric nuclear matter , correlations effects between protons were found to be stronger than those between neutrons .",
    "the increase of the momentum distribution at large @xmath64 values , induced by the src is a well known result in the literature , see for example the review of ref .",
    "the momentum distributions of medium - heavy nuclei , have been usually obtained by using approximated descriptions of the cluster expansion , which is instead considered at all orders in our treatment . the importance of a complete description of the cluster expansion",

    "@xcite , have been used .",

    "the values of the spectroscopic factors depend on the choice of the single particle basis .",
    "as we have already said in the introduction , our results have been obtained by using the woods - saxon single particle bases given in ref .",

    "this description of the @xmath111tl charge distribution , shown by the dotted line in the figure , is still within the ipm framework .",
    "the dashed line has been obtained by adding to the dotted line the core polarization effects produced by long - range correlations .",
    "these effects have been calculated by following the random phase approximation approach of refs . @xcite .",
    "the full line has been obtained when our src effects are also included .",
    "the various effects presented in fig . [ fig:205tl ] have been obtained in different theoretical frameworks , and the final result does not have any pretense of being a well grounded and coherent description of the empirical charge differences .",
    "the point we want to make by showing this figure is that the effects of the src are of the same order of magnitude of those commonly considered in traditional nuclear structure calculations .",
    "in this work we have extended the fhnc / soc scheme in order to calculate the obdm s , the natural orbits and the quasi - hole wave functions of finite nuclear systems non saturated in isospin , and in @xmath24 coupling representation of the single particle wave function basis .",
    "our results have been obtained by using the many - body wave functions obtained by minimizing the nuclear hamiltonian with the two - body realistic interaction argonne @xmath5 and the associated three - body interaction urbana ix .",
    "the calculations have been done by using operator dependent correlations which include terms up to the tensor ones .",
    "we found that the correlations enhance by orders of magnitude the high - energy tail of the nucleon momentum distribution .",
    "the occupation numbers of the natural orbits below the fermi level , are depleted , and the opposite happens for those above the fermi level .",
    "also the values of the spectroscopic factors are depleted with respect to the ipm .",
    "a reliable comparison between our spectroscopic factors with the empirical ones requires the description of the reactions used to extract them , and this is part of our future projects .",
    "we have shown that the results of models considering expansions up to the first order correlation lines , provide only qualitative descriptions of the src effects . in the description of the charge density difference between @xmath116pb and @xmath111tl ,",
    "the src effects are of comparable size of those commonly considered in traditional nuclear structure calculations based on effective theories .    a general outcome of our study ,",
    "is that the effects of the correlations increase with the complexity of the correlation function .",
    "this means that operator dependent correlations enhance the effects produced by the scalar correlations .",
    "this not obvious result , is valid in general , not always .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that scalar and operator dependent correlations have destructive interference effects on the density distributions .",
    "we found in the present study an analogous behavior regarding the natural orbits .",
    "these quantities are related to the density distributions .",
    "it seems that the effects of the src are rather straightforward on quantities which involve two - nucleons , while they are more difficult to predict on quantities related to single nucleon dynamics . on these last quantities ,",
    "however , these src effects are very small , usually negligible .    in our calculations the nuclear interaction acts only in defining the many - body wave functions by means of the variational principle ( [ eq : varprin ] ) , more specifically , in selecting the correlation function ( [ eq : cor2 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to disentangle the role played by the various parts of the interaction , e.g. the tensor part of the three - body force , on the quantities we have studied in this article .",
    "we have instead evaluated the effects of the various parts of the correlation function .    in this work ,",
