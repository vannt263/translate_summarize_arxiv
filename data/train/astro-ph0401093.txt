    "recent experience has demonstrated the utility of integral - field spectroscopy to studies of galaxy dynamics .",
    "verolme  ( 2002 ) , comparing mass models of m32 constrained by integral - field spectroscopy from sauron ( bacon   2001 ) and models constrained only by data along 4 slits extracted from the full two - dimensional ( 2-d ) data set , found that the mass model parameters , including black hole mass , mass - to - light ratio and , in particular , inclination were substantially better constrained with the full 2-d data than with just the slits .    one approach to integral - field spectroscopy is the use of an imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( fp ) , essentially a tunable , narrow - band filter .",
    "the rutgers fabry - perot ( rfp ) , formerly at ctio , found considerable application to the emission - line study of kinematics and mass modeling of disk galaxies (  buta & purcell 1998 ; buta  1999 & 2001 ; beauvais & bothun 1999 & 2001 ; palunas & williams 2000 ; weiner  2001 a , b ) .",
    "however , fp stellar absorption - line spectroscopy in galaxies is significantly more difficult due to the lower surface brightness levels , the shallowness and width of the spectral features , and the effects of time - variable observing conditions on reconstructing line profiles necessarily sampled sequentially over an extended period of observation . because of these difficulties , fp stellar absorption - line spectroscopy",
    "has not been previously successfully attempted in galaxies , although absorption - line spectroscopy of individual stars in globular clusters has been accomplished with considerable success ( gebhardt  1994 , 1995 & 1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the kinematics of a bright , barred , disk galaxy with stellar absorption - line spectroscopy using the rfp , which is well - suited to galactic spectroscopy because of its large field - of - view , high throughput , and appropriate spectral resolution ( @xmath7 ) .    more than half of all high surface brightness disk galaxies are barred ( knapen 1999 ; eskridge  2000 ) .",
    "the fundamental parameter in the dynamics of barred galaxies is the pattern speed of the bar , @xmath3 .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath8 ; here @xmath9 is the length of the semi - major axis of the bar and @xmath10 is the lagrangian / corotation radius , where , in the bar s rest - frame , the centrifugal and gravitational forces balance .",
    "a self - consistent bar with orbits aligned with the bar has @xmath11 ( contopoulos 1980 ) ; when @xmath12 , a bar is termed fast .",
    "because bars have strong quadrupole moments , they lose angular momentum efficiently in the presence of a dense dark matter ( dm ) halo , as first shown by perturbation theory calculations ( weinberg 1985 ) .",
    "early simplified simulations ( little & carlberg 1991 , hernquist & weinberg 1992 ) found agreement with weinberg s calculations .",
    "the presence of dm in disk galaxies is required by their rotation curves , which stay flat out to large radii ( rubin  1980 ; bosma 1981 ) .",
    "determining the relative amounts of luminous and dark matter in the region of the optical disk , however , is a difficult problem , due to degeneracy in the contributions of the two components to the rotation of axi - symmetric systems . the maximum disk hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ) , which requires the maximum amount of disk matter consistent with the inner rotation curve , often accounts for the shapes of the rotation curves of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies (  kalnajs 1983 ; kent 1986 ; corsini  1999 ; palunas & williams 2000 ) .",
    "others studies , however , have argued that maximum disks can not account for other observational properties (  van der kruit 1995 ; bottema 1997 ; courteau & rix 1999 , kranz   2001 ) .",
    "debattista & sellwood ( 1998 ) realized , from fully self - consistent simulations , that fast bars require that barred galaxies have maximum discs . at present",
    ", there is a lively debate about this suggestion ( tremaine & ostriker 1999 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; weinberg & katz 2002 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 ; oneill & dubinski 2003 ) .",
    "one of the issues surrounding this debate concerns just how rapidly bars rotate .",
    "the number of barred galaxies in which @xmath13 has been measured is still relatively small .",
    "evidence that bars are fast comes mostly from simulations of the hydrodynamics of gas in the bar region (  athanassoula 1992 ; lindblad  1996 ) .",
    "the example of ngc 4123 ( weiner  2001b ) is especially instructive because the hydrodynamical simulations require both a fast bar and a maximum disk to match the observed gas shocks . a direct ( model - independent ) method for measuring bar pattern speeds",
    "was devised by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) .",
    "the tremaine - weinberg ( tw ) method is contained in the following simple equation @xmath14 here , , , @xmath15 is the surface brightness , @xmath16 is an arbitrary weighting function , @xmath17 is the line - of - sight velocity , @xmath18 is the disk inclination ( throughout , we use the convention @xmath19 for face - on ) and @xmath20 are galaxy - centered coordinates measured along the disc s apparent major and minor axes , respectively .",
    "although the integrals in @xmath21 and @xmath22 range over @xmath23 , if the disk is axisymmetric at @xmath24 , then integration over @xmath25 suffices .",
    "the integration in @xmath26 is over an arbitrary range , because of @xmath16 ; for example a weight function proportional to a delta function corresponds to a slit parallel to the disk major axis . for a number of such slits , plotting @xmath22 against @xmath21 gives a straight line with slope @xmath27 .",
    "the tw method has previously been applied to a handful of galaxies , all with slit data ( merrifield & kuijken 1995 ; gerssen  1999 ; debattista   2002 ; aguerri  2003 ; gerssen 2003 ) . in all cases ,",
    "bars were found to be consistent with @xmath12 .",
    "however , tw measurements are technically challenging , and in some cases large uncertainties result .",
    "thus , for example , valenzuela & klypin ( 2003 ) argue that @xmath28 , which they find in their simulations , is still consistent with observations . while correct , this claim overlooks the fact that this limit is reached only in those galaxies with the largest uncertainties ( aguerri  2003 , hereafter adc03 ) and ignores other sources of scatter ( debattista 2003 , hereafter d03 ) .",
    "there exists , therefore , a need for at least a few high precision measurements of @xmath13 .",
    "integral field velocity data permit tw measurements of @xmath3 with greater precision , because of the improved spatial coverage . in this paper",
    ", we present observations of 7 using the rfp interferometer , which allowed us to measure 2-d kinematics down to a surface brightness @xmath29 . in  [ sec : n7079 ] we describe 7 , emphasizing those properties which make it a suitable system for this analysis . in  [ sec : phot ] , we present photometry of 7 .",
    "this is the first use of the rfp for absorption - line spectroscopy of galaxies , and therefore in  [ sec : spect ] we present the spectroscopy and reduction methods .",
    "we show that the resulting data are in good agreement with data obtained by standard slit spectroscopy . in  [ sec : kinematics ] , we study the kinematics of 7  and measure @xmath3 with the tw method .",
    "we show at this point that the measured @xmath3 is quite sensitive to small errors in the position angle ( pa ) of the disk .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and conclusions .",
    "in choosing candidates for observation , sb0 galaxies were selected from various catalogues and examined in the _ digitized sky survey_. candidates were chosen with a bar at a position angle intermediate between the minor and major axes of the disk ( as required by the tw method ) , a number of bright stars within @xmath30 of the galaxy center ( to permit determination of temporal atmospheric transmission variations between the rfp frames ) and lacking strong spirals , patchy dust and significant companions .",
    "the galaxies needed to be bright and large , and have known recession velocities ( required for efficient use of the rfp ) . finally , we chose to use the caii 8542.09   absorption line because it is quite strong , and the combination of the red color of sb0 galaxies and the moderately high ccd detector quantum efficiency in this portion of the spectrum maximizes the measurement efficiency here . since this region of the spectrum contains a host of night sky emission features ( see osterbrock  1996 ) , we selected candidate galaxies with red - shifts that placed the caii line in relatively emission - free regions .    7 ( eso 287 - 36 ) satisfied all these conditions .",
    "7 is classified as ( l)sb(r)@xmath31 ( buta 1995 ) , is large and bright ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 [ de vaucouleurs  1991 , hereafter rc3 ] ) and has a measured recession velocity ( @xmath34 , [ lauberts & valentijn 1989 ] ) .",
    "the red - shifted wavelength of the caii line is therefore @xmath35 ; assuming a rotation velocity of about 260   ( bettoni & galletta 1997 ) and allowing for the width of the caii stellar line and for the gradient in wavelength across the rfp frame , we needed to scan the galaxy from @xmath36  to @xmath37 .",
    "the sky has no emission between @xmath38  and @xmath39  and some weak o@xmath40 emission ( which can be subtracted out ) between @xmath39  and @xmath37 .",
    "bettoni & galletta ( 1997 ) detected o[iii ] @xmath41  emission extending out to @xmath42 , but this gas is faintly emitting and is not expected to affect measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "7 is the brightest member of a group containing seven galaxies ( garcia 1993 ) but the nearest large neighbor , eso 287 - 37 , is over @xmath43 away from it , or @xmath44 kpc ( in projection ) at a distance of 38 mpc ( we assume throughout this paper that @xmath45 ) .",
    "the other group members are more than twice as far away , so we expect that 7  should not be significantly perturbed .",
    "we obtained deep images of 7  at the ctio 0.9-m telescope on the night of 1997 august 2 - 3 under photometric conditions .",
    "we used the tek 2k#3 ccd in quad readout mode , with a gain of @xmath46e@xmath47/adu and read noise of @xmath48e@xmath47 averaged over the four quadrants .",
    "the image scale in this configuration was @xmath49/pixel , for an unvignetted field of @xmath50 .",
    "the exposure time for each image of the galaxy was 900 seconds ; we acquired four exposures in @xmath0 , two each in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , and one exposure in @xmath54 .",
    "the seeing through the night was @xmath55 . for the @xmath0-band images",
    ", the telescope was moved between exposures so that the galaxy s image fell on different parts of the ccd , to allow the effects of bad pixels to be removed when the images were combined .",
    "the images were flat - fielded with twilight sky flats , and zero - subtracted as usual .",
    "using the task imalign , the @xmath0-band images were shifted to the nearest pixel , and then combined using the biweight , a robust statistical estimator of the mean that is insensitive to outliers ( beers et al . 1990 ) .",
    "( because of the small pixel scale relative to the seeing , integer pixel shifts were adequate , and avoided interpolation effects around image artifacts . ) a constant sky value , obtained from image regions that were free of stars and galaxy light , was subtracted from each image .",
    "all were then cleaned of cosmic rays using s task cosmicrays .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-band image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] . a @xmath56 map , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] , reveals little structure , apart from a nucleus bluer than the disk , indicating that there is no variable obscuration within the galaxy ( as required for the tw method ) .",
    "two standard stars were used for calibration , e9 - 47-u and e1 - 44-s ( graham 1982 ) .",
    "we obtained the values of the galactic extinction from schlegel  ( 1998 ) via ned .",
    "we did not measure the differential atmospheric extinction , but used the standard value from hamuy  ( 1992 ) .",
    "since we observed 7   and the standard stars all at less than 1.1 air masses , the resulting uncertainties are insignificant for our purposes .      after masking bad pixels , foreground stars , and all pixels outside @xmath57 from the galaxy center , we fitted ellipses , with fixed centers , to single @xmath54 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53-band images , and to the combined @xmath0-band image , using the  task ellipse .",
    "we determined integrated magnitudes using the fitted ellipses and s task bmodel .",
    "we do not correct these magnitudes for the galaxy s inclination .",
    "our results are reported in table [ tab : magnitudes ] , along with the total asymptotic @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 aperture - magnitudes given in rc3 .",
    "our magnitudes for 7  are a bit fainter than rc3 , possibly because we masked out the bright stars in the vicinity of the galaxy , and have not extrapolated the profiles to infinity .",
    "to measure the colors , we again used the task ellipse , but now constrained to measure the photometry in the same ellipses as were fitted to the @xmath0-band , so that magnitudes can be meaningfully compared in the same regions .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfbright ] .",
    "apart from the slightly bluer nucleus , the color profile is remarkably flat , with barely detectable color gradients .",
    "we fitted separate exponential disks to the photometry in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath0 in the radial range @xmath58 , finding an average scale - length , @xmath59 , of @xmath60 ( corresponding to @xmath61 kpc at our assumed distance ) and @xmath62 .",
    "the latter value deprojects to 21.0 , close to the freeman ( 1970 ) limit ( @xmath63 ) . at @xmath64 , the surface brightness profile steepens .",
    "this break radius remained unchanged when we fitted ellipses after changing the constant sky background level by @xmath65 , and is identical for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath0 bands , despite a difference in sky background level of three magnitudes .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the break in the surface brightness is not an artifact of imperfect sky subtraction .",
    "sharp disk truncations have been noted in photographic plate studies ( van der kruit 1979 ) , while in a large sample of edge - on galaxies , pohlen  ( 2002 ) found radial structure that is better fit by two exponentials , rather than by sharply truncated exponentials .",
    "his break radii ( @xmath66 ) and surface brightnesses at @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) agree well with the values we obtain for the break in 7 ( 2.6 and 22.0 , respectively ) .",
    "while the fact that @xmath67 is identical in all bands argues forcefully that this is a real structure , it is clear that the disk profile continues past @xmath67 (   narayan & jog 2003 ) .",
    "we use data at semi - major axis larger than @xmath69 to calculate the median values of the disk ellipticity , @xmath70 , and .",
    "[ fig : ellipses ] shows these results averaged over all colors .",
    "we find @xmath71 corresponding to an inclination @xmath72 for a razor - thin disk .",
    "if , however , the ratio of disk scale height to scale length is @xmath73 , we use the standard equation ( hubble 1926 ) @xmath74 , to obtain @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath76 , which is in good agreement with rc3 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "our value of @xmath78 ; the rc3 value for this parameter is @xmath79 .",
    "since a bar represents an @xmath80 perturbation of the disk density , a fourier decomposition of the deprojected surface density is well - suited to measuring the semi - major axis of the bar , @xmath9 .",
    "since two independent parameters , an amplitude and a phase , define each @xmath81 harmonic , two independent estimates of @xmath9 are possible from a fourier decomposition .",
    "our first estimate of @xmath9 , based on amplitudes , is given by the method of aguerri  ( 2000 ) , which has been used in other early - type barred galaxies ( debattista  2002 , adc03 ) .",
    "the method defines @xmath9 as the radius for which , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the amplitude of the @xmath80 fourier component , normalized by that of @xmath85 . for 7",
    "this prescription gives @xmath86 . for a phase - based estimate of @xmath9",
    ", we deprojected the ellipse fits and measured the phase angle of the resulting ellipses .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is then the largest radius out to which the phases are consistent with a constant , taking into account that deprojecting the bulge , which we did not subtract from our image for this analysis , results in a twist interior to the bar .",
    "we found @xmath87 this way ; we therefore adopt @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : barlen ] presents the bar - length analysis and also shows that @xmath89 , the bar - angle in the intrinsic galaxy frame as measured from the major - axis of the disk , is @xmath90 , which projects to pa@xmath91 .",
    "we observed 7 on 1997 july 28 with the ctio 4-m telescope using the rfp imaging interferometer and the tek 2k#6 ccd .",
    "the instrument has a circular field of view of radius @xmath92 , and the detector was operated with @xmath93 pixel binning , producing an image scale of @xmath94/pixel . the detector gain and read noise were @xmath95 e@xmath47/adu and @xmath96 e@xmath47 , respectively .",
    "we used the `` broad '' rfp etalon , with a resolution fwhm @xmath97   ( 150 ) and free spectral range of @xmath98    at the caii line .",
    "the spectral instrumental profile of the rfp is well fitted by a voigt profile , the convolution of a lorentzian and a gaussian of widths @xmath99   and @xmath100  , respectively .",
    "we used a blocking filter of fwhm 100   to select the desired spectral order .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the rfp was determined with a precision of @xmath101  .",
    "because the wavelength zero point and the optical center drift during the night ( due to flexure , temperature changes , ) , we took additional calibration measurements hourly through the night and incorporated these corrections in the data reductions .",
    "we found average drift rates of @xmath102  / hour and @xmath103 pixels / hour for the zero point and the optical center , respectively .",
    "the temperature dropped during the night , until the telescope primary mirror was some @xmath104c warmer than the ambient air , producing poor seeing of @xmath105 ( fwhm ) .",
    "there were also strong winds , reaching 50 mph by morning and the night was non - photometric , with thin variable cloud .",
    "nevertheless , we managed to obtain 24 exposures of 900 seconds each , spanning the wavelength range @xmath106   in steps of @xmath107  ( 35  at 8618  ) .",
    "we first stepped through the full wavelength range in steps of @xmath108 , and then filled in the intermediate wavelengths with a second scan ( one wavelength sample was inadvertently repeated ) .",
    "the images were zero subtracted and flat - field corrected ( with the median of 3 dome flats at each wavelength ) in the the usual way .",
    "cosmic rays were then cleaned by replacement using . in an imaging fp ,",
    "the transmitted wavelength varies quadratically with the distance from the optical axis ; for the rfp at caii the field is @xmath109   bluer at the outer edge than on the optical axis .",
    "thus the sky background in each frame varies radially due to the spectral energy distribution of the night sky .",
    "we offset 7  to the right half of the field of view , so that we could determine the sky spectrum from the left half of the field .",
    "because some faint galaxy - light from the outer disk does reach to the left side of the frames , as well as a ghost image from reflections off the ccd and fp , we developed an iterative scheme to determine and subtract the sky .",
    "briefly , the initial estimate of the sky spectrum was determined from the left half of the image , and subtracted from the entire image ; this approximately sky - free image was used to estimate and remove the contributions of the outer galaxy and the ghost reflection from the left half of the original image , leading to an improved estimate of the sky spectrum .",
    "a second iteration of this procedure produced the final sky spectrum that was subtracted from the images .",
    "the images were then masked , shifted to a common frame and convolved with a radially symmetric gaussian to a common seeing .",
    "we did this twice , once for all 24 images , ( seeing fwhm @xmath110 ) and again for the best 18 images , excluding those obtained under poor conditions at the end of the night ( resulting fwhm @xmath111 ) . since the atmospheric transparency varied by @xmath112 during the night , all images needed to be normalized to a common transparency .",
    "we determined the normalization coefficients by measuring the flux of seven bright stars in our field and assuming their mean spectrum over our wavelength range was flat and featureless .",
    "finally , we generated noise maps which include photon , sky and read noise , and which account for the gaussian and image registration smoothings .",
    "to determine the kinematic properties of 7 , we fit a voigt profile to the spectral data at each spatial position in the fp data cube .",
    "the data to be fit were smoothed with box car averaging using an adaptive kernel ranging from @xmath113 to @xmath114 pixels based on the flux level , and the fits were weighted by the inverse square of the estimated flux uncertainties .",
    "the parameters of the fit were the continuum level , the line strength , the line - of - sight velocity , and the gaussian velocity dispersion ; maps of these quantities and their uncertainties were produced .",
    "we were able to obtain reliable fits within an ellipse of semi - major axis length of @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we did not attempt to fit higher velocity moments , such as the gauss - hermite moments @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( gerhard 1993 , van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "a comparison of the velocity fits produced from the 18 and 24 image data cubes showed no significant differences , mostly because of the poor quality of the last 6 images ; in the following , therefore , we consider only the fits based on the better - seeing ( 18 image ) data cube .",
    "[ fig : velsigfld ] presents the resulting velocity and velocity dispersion maps .",
    "other than a slight s distortion in the central regions due to the bar , the velocity distribution is that expected for an inclined , rotating disk .",
    "the velocity dispersion is largest in the nucleus and bulge , lower along the bar , and smallest in the disk .",
    "examples of fitted profiles are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : velprofs ] ; these show successful fits from the galaxy center ( panel 3 ) to @xmath119  ( panels 1 and 7 ) . by @xmath120 ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is too low and only the noise is fit ( panel 12 ) . the spectrum of one of the foreground stars ( panel 10 ) is essentially constant ( with possibly a very weak fe @xmath121   line ) . as seen in panel 3 , the fp scan did not extend far enough in wavelength to sample the continuum adequately in the high velocity dispersion regions in the center of the galaxy ; thus while the velocities are well - determined here , the velocity dispersion measurements have larger systematic uncertainties .      since this is the first application of the rfp to absorption - line spectroscopy of galaxies , it is important to confirm that our results agree with those obtained by traditional slit spectroscopy . for this purpose ,",
    "e. m. corsini kindly obtained and reduced for us a long - slit spectrum along the major axis of 7 .",

    "[ fig : slitcomp ] , we compare the slit spectrum velocity and dispersion data with data extracted from our rfp 2-d maps in a @xmath130 wide pseudo - slit along the major axis , smoothing along the pseudo - slit to match the slit spectrum smoothing .",
    "there is a zero - point offset of 14  between the two velocity data sets , which has been added to the plotted data .",
    "the two data sets agree well , with very similar amplitudes and shapes of the rotation curves .",
    "a chi - square analysis suggests that the velocity uncertainties are under - estimated , and that an additional uncertainty of 8.4  should be added in quadrature to the error estimates . if all this additional uncertainty is assigned to the rfp data , the typical uncertainty of our velocity measurements is 12 ; if the additional uncertainty is divided evenly between the two data sets , the typical rfp errors are 10  ( and typical slit spectrum errors are 8 ) .",
    "the rfp velocity dispersion data have more scatter and larger estimated errors than the slit velocity dispersions .",
    "as noted above , we expect the lack of sufficient wavelength coverage to affect the precision of the rfp dispersion measurements when the dispersions are large , as in most of the points along the pseudo - slit .",
    "nonetheless , the two data sets are in good general agreement , tracing similar amplitudes and distributions of the velocity dispersion . again",
    ", a chi - square analysis suggests that the uncertainties are under - estimated , and that an additional uncertainty of 20.1  should be added in quadrature to the error estimates . if all this additional error is assigned to the rfp measurements , their typical precision is 31 ; if the additional error is split equally between the two data sets , the rfp uncertainties are 27   and the slit spectra errors are 15 . there is some marginal indication that the velocity dispersions measured with the rfp are systematically larger than with the slit spectrograph .",
    "the mean difference of all the measurements is 8 , and the mean difference of the measurements at radial distances greater than @xmath131 ( where the rfp profiles are adequately sampled ) is 15 ; these biases are smaller than the estimated uncertainties , and the spectral resolution of the rfp ( corresponding to an instrumental dispersion of 64 ) makes precision measurements of dispersions below 50  problematic .",
    "since the rfp and slit spectrograph data attain comparable results and accuracies , it is straightforward to compare the relative efficiencies of the two methods . since the spectral resolution of this spectrograph was about 2.2 times better than that of the rfp , it should have been possible to widen the slit to @xmath132 and still measure velocities with accuracies comparable to the rfp . in an 1800 second exposure",
    ", the spectrographic data reached to a limiting radius of @xmath133 , while the rfp data extended to @xmath134 , about 1.3 magnitudes fainter .",
    "the total rfp exposure time was @xmath135 seconds .",
    "the sky and galaxy flux levels were sufficiently high that both instruments were in the photon noise limit regime .",
    "thus , taking into account the telescope apertures and the noise from the sky background , a single slit spectrogram with @xmath132 slit would reach the same surface brightness about @xmath136 faster than the rfp . however , the rfp data extend out to @xmath137 along the galaxy minor axis ; to cover this same area would require 20 spectrographic exposures . thus the rfp is approximately @xmath138 more efficient than a slit spectrograph for measuring the two - dimensional velocity field of this galaxy .",
    "we therefore conclude that the rfp data is in good agreement with the slit spectrum data , and that the rfp technique affords a reliable means for obtaining absorption - line galaxy kinematics with significantly greater efficiency that standard slit spectroscopy .",
    "using the velocity field data , we obtained the stellar mean rotation velocity curve , @xmath139 , by fitting tilted - rings ( begeman 1987 , palunas 1996 ) , with the galaxy center , inclination and  fixed to the values found in the photometry .",

    "[ fig : vels ] . subtracting @xmath139 from the velocity map produced small residuals , mostly @xmath145  except near the bright foreground stars .    to determine the rotation curve of the galaxy we needed to correct for the asymmetric drift , a procedure which is somewhat uncertain .",
    "the asymmetric drift equation for the circular velocity , @xmath146 , is (   binney & tremaine [ 1987 ] eqn .",
    "4 - 33 ) @xmath147 , \\label{eqn : asymdrif}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 is the disk s volume density , and @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the tangential and radial velocity dispersions in the cylindrical coordinates of the galaxy s intrinsic plane . to proceed further",
    ", we needed to make a number of assumptions .",
    "following adc03 , we assumed that the rotation curve is flat at large radii and that both @xmath151 and @xmath148 decrease exponentially with radius .",
    "thus the asymmetric drift equation becomes @xmath152 ^ 2 } { \\sin^2 i ( 1 + 2 \\alpha^2 \\cot^2i ) } \\left [ 2 r \\left ( \\frac{1}{r_{\\rm d } } + \\frac{2}{r_\\sigma } \\right ) - 1 \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the parameters of the exponential fit to the observed major - axis velocity dispersion profile , and @xmath156 is the exponential scale - length of the surface density .",
    "as in adc03 , we use three values of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , appropriate for early - type galaxies ( gerssen  1997 , 2000 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vels ] , we present this asymmetric drift correction to points at @xmath159 .",
    "we used @xmath160 from the photometry , as appropriate for the region of interest , and fitted an exponential to @xmath151 along a 7-pixel - wide slit on the major axis .",
    "we found a circular velocity amplitude , @xmath161 .",
    "the radially - averaged mean streaming velocity in the same radial range is @xmath162 .",
    "we calculated the tw integrals for 7  in 9 strips in the ranges @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the limits on large @xmath165 were chosen to avoid contamination by the bright stars flanking 7  near its the minor axis .",
    "the limits on small @xmath165 were chosen to avoid a small ( @xmath166 pixel ) offset between the kinematic and photometric centers , to which @xmath22 is sensitive because of the centrally peaked light distribution . in our standard case , we calculated the integrals inside an ellipse of semi - major axis , @xmath167 , which does not quite reach the axisymmetric part of the disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipses ] ) , but where the surface brightness is more than five magnitudes below the central value ( compare d03 ) .",
    "we chose the function @xmath16 for each integral to be the integrated surface brightness within the strip .",
    "we obtained error estimates for @xmath22 from 100 monte - carlo realizations , where the observed velocity field was modified at each point by adding a velocity randomly drawn from a gaussian distribution of width equal to the estimated velocity uncertainty at that point plus an additional 8.4  added in quadrature to account for the possible underestimate of the velocity uncertainty . in the standard case , we used for @xmath168 the @xmath0-band map ; to match the photometric and kinematic maps , we first convolved the former to the seeing of the latter , then used several of the stars in the field of both maps to compute a geometric transformation between them .",
    "this transformation required only a translation and a single scale for @xmath169 and @xmath26 , with no rotation or shear .",
    "the results for the standard case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twintegrals ] ; the best fitting slope is @xmath170  ( the negative sign here reflects only on our arbitrary choice of positive @xmath169 ) .",
    "we checked that this value is not sensitive to various choices we made .",
    "we first tested that using the @xmath0-band photometry has not biased our result by using instead an image generated by summing all the rfp frames .",
    "the resulting slope was @xmath171 , in good agreement with the standard case .",
    "we also checked that our limits on the integrals are reasonable by confirming convergence of the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 when we changed the semi - major axis , @xmath172 , of the ellipse within which the integrals were performed . in the range @xmath173 ,",
    "the variations in @xmath22 are all within the standard errors .",
    "we use the variations in @xmath21 in @xmath174 to define the errors in @xmath21 ; these small errors lead to negligible change in the value of the fitted slope and its uncertainty .    from this slope",
    "we calculate @xmath4 , and @xmath175 ( 67%confidence interval ) .",
    "we then find that @xmath176 at the 67% confidence interval and @xmath177 at the 99% confidence interval , where we obtained the uncertainties by monte carlo experiments in which we varied @xmath178 and @xmath9 uniformly in their error intervals and @xmath3 assuming gaussian errors . at a probability of higher than @xmath179 ,",
    "7  has a fast bar .",
    "note that , if the rfp over - estimates the velocity dispersions in the region of interest , then the real @xmath13 would be even lower ; in the limiting ( and unphysical ) case that velocity dispersions are negligible in the region of interest , we obtain @xmath180 .",
    "our 2-d data also allowed us to study the effects of errors in  on the fitted slope . in the convention where the error in , @xmath181 , moves  away from alignment with the bar when @xmath181 is positive ( the same convention as in d03 ) , we repeated our standard tw measurement as before but for @xmath182 .",
    "the results , plotted in fig . [ fig : paerrs ] , reveal that the slope is quite sensitive to rather small @xmath181 .",
    "errors in  of order @xmath183 , for example , produce large errors in @xmath3 , @xmath184 . clearly , how accurately @xmath3 can be measured depends strongly on how well  can be determined . our high - precision determination of  ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ellipses ] ) allows us to determine @xmath3 with the small uncertainty quoted above .",
    "note however that had we used the value of  from rc3 , our value of @xmath3 would have been some @xmath185 larger .",
    "these results are consistent with those of d03 who studied @xmath186 systematically by means of an @xmath187-body simulation .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath3 calculated here from the 7  observations is , if anything , somewhat larger than in d03 ( compare our fig .",
    "[ fig : paerrs ] with fig . 9 in d03 ) . because  errors can also be produced by disk density ellipticities",
    ", d03 was able to show that such ellipticities had to be @xmath188 for the sample of sb0 galaxies with tw measurements .",
    "we have shown that fp techniques can measure galaxy kinematics from stellar absorption - lines in early - type galaxies . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first successful demonstration of this technique .",
    "comparison with a traditional slit spectrogram along the major axis of the galaxy confirms the accuracy of the fp measurements . for the galaxy observed here , mapping",
    "the kinematics was about 6 times more efficient with the fp than with a slit spectrograph . for an object that fills more of the fp field of view",
    ", the advantage would be even greater .",
    "the fact that the spectral and spatial resolutions are decoupled with an imaging fp affords a great deal of flexibility in the data analysis , allowing extended measurements at lower spatial resolution in the faint outer regions of galaxies .",
    "since the fp samples a large area on the sky , the determination and subtraction of the sky spectrum can be performed with high precision , again allowing measurement to fainter surface brightnesses .",
    "the full 2d format of fp kinematic maps permits unambiguous determination of the positions at which velocity samples are obtained , and allows optimal extraction of information in crowded fields , which can be difficult with slit data .",
    "there are some limitations to using a fp for absorption - line spectroscopy .",
    "the temporal sampling of the spectrum limits the accuracy of reconstruction of the line profile ; this is the reason why we did not pursue measurement of higher order moments of the velocity distribution function .",
    "the next generation rfp , with a built - in transparency monitor , should help alleviate this difficulty .",
    "the reduction of fp data has a reputation for difficulty ; we believe that this is more due to the wealth of information available in a full 2d kinematic dataset than to the inherent difficulty of analyzing the fp data .",
    "nonetheless , the techniques for handling fp data are not widely known , and fp software is neither as generally available nor as robust as the packages for slit spectroscopy . finally ,",
    "while we have shown the significant efficiency of a fp for producing a full 2d map of the stellar kinematics of a galaxy , there are many classes of investigation for which such extensive data are not required . in such situations traditional",
    "slit spectroscopy is both simpler and more efficient .",
    "these problems should not , however , be overstated .",
    "the promise of fp absorption - line spectroscopy is demonstrated by the results obtained here .",
    "this is the tightest bound on @xmath13 ever obtained on a barred galaxy using the tw method , with a 67% interval less than half that for the next best published case ( eso 139-g009 , adc03 ) .",
    "more dramatically , the fractional uncertainty on @xmath3 is less than @xmath189 : typical uncertainties from slit spectroscopy are @xmath190 .",
    "we showed that , in order to measure @xmath3 to such high precision , the pa of the disk needs to be known quite accurately .",
    "our s is the first demonstration on a real galaxy that the tw method is sensitive to small errors in pa . for 7",
    ", we were able to measure  to better than @xmath191 .",
    "but if we had relied on the rc3 value of  we would have obtained a value of @xmath192 larger .",
    "we found , at high confidence , a fast bar in 7 .",
    "as in all previous measurements with good precision , the probability that @xmath193 is low : if we assume extreme values for @xmath9 and @xmath194 to maximize @xmath13 , we find that @xmath193 requires @xmath195 , or over @xmath196 smaller than our measured value .",
