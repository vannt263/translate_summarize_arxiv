    "one of the central issues of the high - energy heavy - ion physics is to investigate the phases of the hadronic and quark matter .",
    "hydrodynamical descriptions@xcite , which have a rather long history , may be a powerful tool for studying such phase diagrams because we can handle the equation of state directly in the model .",
    "however , to extract precisely information about the equation of state , we must be careful in comparing the model predictions with experimental data because procedures of event averaging may make signal of qgp ambiguous .",
    "event - by - event analysis@xcite is one of promising ways to extract clear information from the experimental data , in particular at rhic and lhc energy regions .",
    "the fluctuations at the initial stage ( for example , the initial energy density fluctuation ) must affect the formation of qgp and the later space - time evolution of the whole system .",
    "fig.1 shows the energy density ( counter plot , at @xmath2 plane ) for a au+au collision at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , produced by nexus code@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the fluctuations at the initial stage of relativistic heavy - ion collisions are not negligible . to achieve an event - by - event analysis using relativistic hydrodynamical model ,",
    "the numerical code must deal with arbitrary initial conditions and equation of state with suitable calculational speed and precision .",
    "the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph)@xcite , which was first introduced for astrophysical applications@xcite , satisfy such requirements .",
    "the main characteristic of sph is the introduction of `` particles '' attached to some conserved quantity which are described in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates .",
    "this feature of the model enables to easily carry out calculations of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , which is accompanied by prominent longitudinal expansion .",
    "another advantage of using sph method is that we can choose a suitable precision in solving hydrodynamical equations because of the smoothing kernel , which allows to smooth out often unnecessary very precise local aspects and then achieve a reduction of computational time .",
    "this is a very profitable point in the event - by - event analysis .    in the following section , we briefly formulate the entropy - based sph , using the variational approach@xcite . in sec.3 , to check the performance of sph",
    ", we apply it for solving problems of relativistic hydrodynamics whose solutions are known analytically or numerically .",
    "then , in sec.4 , we demonstrate hydrodynamical evolutions of both resonance gas and quark gluon plasma starting from the same simple initial conditions . in sec.5 , after giving a brief explanation how to take the initial conditions of nexus into our code , we present typical hydrodynamical evolution of an event at rhic energy . to introduce freeze - out process into our code , we formulate cooper - frye formula in terms of sph and show several results on single - particle spectrum in sec.6 . then , we study the event - by - event fluctuation of elliptic flow coefficient @xmath1@xcite at rhic energy@xcite in sec.7 , showing that the dispersion is large and it does depend on the equation of state used .",
    "finally we close our discussions with some concluding remarks .",
    "to specify the hydrodynamical state of a fluid , we need to locally know the thermodynamical quantities such as the energy density @xmath5 and the collective velocity field , besides equation of state of the fluid .",
    "if local thermal equilibrium is well established , the thermodynamical variables may be expressed by smooth functions of the coordinates .",
    "let us choose @xmath6 space points to specify the state of the whole system . to know the physical quantities in other space points , we may use an interpolation using the known @xmath6 points .",
    "( hereafter we use the word ` particles ' instead of ` points ' . )    in sph , for an arbitrary extensive thermodynamical quantity of @xmath7 , the density ( in the space - fixed frame ) @xmath8 is parametrized in the following way : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a positive definite kernel function with the properties @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a smoothing - scale parameter . using the normalization above",
    ", we have @xmath13 from eq.([a_total ] ) the quantity @xmath14 can be interpreted as a portion of @xmath7 which is carried by the @xmath15th particle .",
    "its velocity , identified as the velocity of the fluid at @xmath16 , satisfies @xmath17 if @xmath7 is a conserved quantity , @xmath14 must be constant in time . in this case , from eqs.([sph - repre ] ) and ( [ velocity ] ) , we obtain @xmath18 where @xmath19 is interpreted as the current density of the thermodynamical quantity @xmath7 and eq.([continuity ] ) is then the corresponding continuity equation .",
    "to know the time evolution of the fluid , we have to find the equation of motion for each sph particle",
    ". it can be obtained by the variational method@xcite with the following lagrangian@xcite @xmath20 it should be noted here that the factor @xmath21 can be regarded as the volume @xmath22 ( in the space - fixed frame ) occupied by the @xmath15th ` particle ' .",
    "then each term in eq.([lagrangian1 ] ) is equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the energy ( in the rest frame ) and the gamma factor of the @xmath15th particle , respectively .",
    "then we also write @xmath26    the equations of motion of sph particles are obtained minimizing the action @xmath27 with respect to @xmath28 with the constraint given by eq.([velocity ] ) taken into account @xmath29 using the adiabatic condition @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31        ~{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\nabla$}}}w({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}_i-{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}_j;h ) = 0 ~ ,       \\label{eq.motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the pressure . because of the adiabatic condition , eqs.([eq.motion ] ) are the equations of motion for the ideal fluid . for the extension to the non - adiabatic case , see ref.@xcite .      as a possible candidate for the thermodynamical extensive quantity @xmath8",
    ", we may consider baryon number density , entropy density , energy density and so on . in the case of energy density",
    ", we have ( cf . eq.([lagrangian1 ] ) and ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) ) @xmath33 however , this is only the internal energy , so @xmath14 is not constant with respect to the variation of @xmath34 in eq.([mini - i ] ) , introducing an additional complication without any practical merit . on the other hand , for entropy or baryon number density , for example",
    ", @xmath14 can be kept constant . since we will apply sph to ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , baryon number density is not so suitable choice because it is expected to be very small in the central rapidity region",
    ". let us choose the entropy density for @xmath8 in eq.([sph - repre ] ) .    in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "initial conditions of fluid are often given at constant @xmath35 .",
    "then , it is convenient to formulate sph in the coordinates @xmath36 the sph equations in generalized coordinate system are easily derived in a similar way@xcite . in the case of the coordinate above , the sph equations of motion",
    "should be written as @xmath37        ~{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\nabla$}}}w[{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}_i-{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}_j;h ] = 0   ~. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "to check the performance of sph formulated in sec.2 , we applied it to a problem of relativistic hydrodynamics whose solution is known analytically .",
    "when the longitudinal rapidity @xmath38 and the transverse one @xmath39 are given as @xmath40 it is known that the entropy density is given by @xmath41^{3/2}}~ ,    \\label{3dscaling }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a constant which is determined by the initial conditions . a comparison of the numerical results by sph with the analytical solution eq.([3dscaling ] )",
    "is shown in fig.2 , where the equation of state used was @xmath43 .",
    "it is verified that sph solves this problem correctly . for a further check ,",
    "we applied it also to another problem , namely , relativistic hydrodynamics with the longitudinal scaling and the landau - type initial condition in the transverse directions , @xmath44 figure 3 shows a comparison of the sph results with those obtained by hama and pottag@xcite .",
    "the initial conditions and the equation of state used are exactly the same as in ref.@xcite .",
    "we found that sph works well also in this problem .",
    "to complete the theory of relativistic hydrodynamics , the equation of state ( eos ) for the fluid is required .",
    "we use two possible eos in the present study , namely , a resonance gas eos@xcite and an eos containing both resonance gas and qgp via a first order phase transition@xcite .",
    "the eos are parametrized as follows ( see also fig.4 . ) : @xmath45 for the resonance gas ( rg ) and @xmath46 for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) eos .",
    "the bag constant @xmath47 is determined to give the critical temperature @xmath48 .",
    "a remark should be made here that when we call qgp eos , here and in the following sections , we are actually considering all these three states according to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "we show some results of the hydrodynamical evolution using such rg and qgp eos in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "for the both cases , the initial ( @xmath49 ) entropy density @xmath50 , longitudinal and transverse rapidity @xmath38 , @xmath39 are set as @xmath51 , \\quad \\alpha = \\eta~,\\quad \\beta = 0 ~.      \\quad \\mbox{for   $ \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<7.0~fm$ ,   $ |\\eta|<7.0 $ ~. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as seen in figs.5 and 6 , the space - time evolution of the fluid strongly depends on the eos . in comparison with the rg case ,",
    "the temperature of the fluid in qgp eos drops much slowly due to the existence of the mixed phase , where the pressure is constant .",
    "the most fundamental assumption of hydrodynamical models is the thermalization of partonic or hadronic systems produced after high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in our study , we set the initial conditions using information from nexus event generator@xcite , in the following 2 steps .    1 .",
    "align all primary hadrons on the @xmath52 hypersurface . here",
    "we assume that the primary hadrons move freely with the momentum @xmath53 .",
    "in the present study , we use @xmath54 .",
    "the initial energy density and momentum density are estimated using the interpolation kernel @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 are the coordinates of the @xmath15-th primary hadron after the alignment on @xmath52 .",
    "the smoothing scale parameter @xmath58 is used , which is the rough size of the hadrons . the collective velocity field",
    "is then given by @xmath59  .",
    "in fig.7 , we show the hydrodynamical evolution of a typical event of @xmath60 collision at energy @xmath61 for the impact parameter @xmath62 given by our hydro code , spherio , connected to the nexus event generator .",
    "the cooper - frye formula@xcite is widely used in calculations of single particle spectra using hydrodynamical models because of its simplicity .",
    "so , as the first trial to evaluating single particle densities , we shall follow it .    in sph , using eq.([sph - repre - s ] ) , the usual cooper - frye formula can be rewritten as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the normal vector of the isothermals : @xmath67 the integration is usually done over a constant temperature hypersurface , @xmath68 . when the spline - type kernel function@xcite is used , @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",

    "the result of the single - particle spectra , @xmath74 , @xmath0 and @xmath75 for au+au collisions at @xmath61 , @xmath76 are shown in figs . 8 , 9 and 10 , respectively .",
    "the freeze - out temperature used is @xmath77 .",
    "the flow phenomena@xcite can be important candidates of qgp signals because they may carry much information about eos during the expansion of quark or hadronic matter .",
    "in particular , the elliptic flow coefficients@xcite is one of the interesting observables since it is sensitive to the early stage of high - energy heavy - ion collisions . because it is expected that different eos responds to the initial fluctuations in different way , the measure of fluctuation , for example",
    ", @xmath78 is also very important . for this purpose",
    ", we investigate @xmath1 distribution using different eos . in figs.11 , 12 and table 1 ,",
    "we show results of the @xmath1 distribution for @xmath60 collisions at energy @xmath61 in rg and qgp eos cases .    as seen in table 1 , the fluctuations of flow coefficient @xmath1 in qgp is about 20 @xmath79 30% smaller than that in rg ( cf .",

    "hence , it is expected that @xmath82 also brings us useful information to infer on the phase passed in the early stage of high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "it is also interesting to study the fluctuation of the so - called slope parameter in the transverse momentum spectra .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath83 can be obtained by fitting @xmath84 with a function @xmath85}$ ] . in the present study ,",
    "@xmath86 interval is used for the fitting .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "we found @xmath83 and @xmath87 of qgp is systematically smaller than that of rg .",
    "other interesting measurement may be multiplicity fluctuation .",
    "let us define the fluctuation measure as @xmath88 where @xmath89",
    "we investigate the eos dependence of the multiplicity fluctuation in two central ( @xmath90 ) rapidity windows @xmath91 and as function of the impact parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 .",
    "as seen there , the multiplicities and their fluctuations @xmath92 have a clear eos dependence .",
    "13 and 14 .",
    "when the initial energy density is bellow @xmath93 the multiplicity fluctuation with qgp eos is expected to be larger than that of rg without first order phase transition .",
    "this is due to the existence of the mixed phase ( see appendix ) .",
    "the values of ratio @xmath94 of qgp is slightly larger than those of rg .",
    "we developed a new hydrodynamical code , spherio , based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , for studying high - energy heavy - ion collisions in event - by - event basis . in this study , we set the initial conditions based on the results of nexus event generator and used two types of possible equation of states ( eos ) , @xmath95 , the resonance gas ( rg ) and quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) eos . in the freeze - out process ,",
    "single particle spectra are calculated by the cooper - frye formula for each set of initial conditions and eos .",
    "analyzing these single particle spectra , the fluctuations in flow coefficients , slope parameter @xmath83 and multiplicities in the central rapidity regions are investigated at rich energy .    as seen in the results of table 1 , we found remarkable difference in @xmath82 between rg and qgp eos predictions .",
    "this means that the measure of the fluctuations is also helpful to infer the phase passed in the high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in the qgp eos case ,",
    "the fluctuations are about @xmath96 % smaller than those in rg case .",
    "our predictions of the average value of @xmath1 is shown in fig.15 , compared with star collaboration data@xcite .",
