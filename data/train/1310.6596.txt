    "microelectrode arrays are increasingly employed in electrochemistry@xcite , since they can provide the advantages of microelectrodes ( fast mass transport , the use of two rather than three electrode control , observation of steady state currents ) whilst providing the large currents usually associated with macroelectrodes .",
    "these arrays also have considerably less capacitative current than macroelectrodes , although generally more than isolated microelectrodes , representing an intermediate case@xcite .",
    "however , while single microelectrodes typically have a much smaller ohmic drop than macroelectrodes ( due to the smaller currents drawn ) , a microelectrode array has significantly larger ohmic drop than a macroelectrode of equivalent overall area@xcite .",
    "the main types of array electrodes are arrays of microdiscs ( where the array may be regular or random ) and arrays of microbands .",
    "microband arrays , as well as a single pair of bands , have been used as generator - collector systems@xcite , with great success . in a collector generator system ,",
    "some target species in solution is oxidised ( or reduced ) at the generator electrode , with the product of this reaction then detected by re - reduction ( or oxidation ) at the collector electrode .",
    "if single step chronoamperometry , for example , were to be carried out , then some species might would be oxidised at the generator electrode to produce species b , which would then be reduced at the collector electrode , both under diffusion control : @xmath4 an important feature in an experiment of this type is the collection efficiency , @xmath5 , the ratio of the collector current to the generator current : @xmath6 this simple experiment can be extended to performing cyclic voltammetry at the generator electrode , while keeping the collector electrode fixed at the potential to reduce species b. this approach has been used to study , for example , competing modes of transport at a phase boundary ( transport along the interface vs transport in bulk)@xcite .",
    "other uses of collector generator systems include mechanistic invesigations@xcite , probing intermediate kinetics@xcite , electrochemical sensing with very low detection limits@xcite , targeted detection of one species in the presence of another@xcite , and the simultaneous measurement of two species@xcite .",
    "microband arrays lend themselves particularly well to generator - collector systems .",
    "they consist of a series of parallel bands , which alternate between being generator and collector .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ ida schematic ] , and the apparatus is known as an interdigitated array ( idba ) .",
    "this ensures a very high collection efficiency@xcite , since any species produced at the generator electrode is likely to diffuse to the collector electrode with a high probability of detection if the separation is small .",
    "this spatial arrangement also allows for efficient redox cycling@xcite , where species cycle between generator and collector electrodes , enhancing the measured current .",
    "idbas have been used to simultaneously measure both the concentration and diffusion coefficient of a species .",
    "aoki _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite developed a theoretical equation for the steady state current produced at a parallel microband array electrode during a chronoamperometric experiment as outlined above : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the steady state current ( a ) , @xmath9 is the number of electrons transfered , @xmath10 is the faraday constant , @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient of the species under investigation ( m@xmath12  s@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is this species bulk concentration ( mol  m@xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the length of the individual band electrodes ( m ) , and @xmath17 is some function of the electrode geometry . the function @xmath18 is a total elliptic integral , and @xmath19 can be approximated as : @xmath20 - 0.095\\left(1 + \\frac{w_e}{w_g}\\right)^{-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the inter - electrode distance and the electrode width respectively .",
    "also developed was an empirical equation to described the time taken for the current at the collector electrode to reach half of its steady state value , @xmath23 : @xmath24 so by measuring the steady state current and the time taken for to reach half this value , equations [ equation1 ] and [ equation2 ] can be solved simultaneously to determine @xmath14 and @xmath11 .    a convenient and important variation on idbas are interdigitated ring electrode arrays , idras@xcite .",
    "a schematic of an idra is shown in fig .",
    "[ idra schematic ] .",
    "they consist of a central disc electrode ( throughout this paper considered to be a generator electrode ) surrounded by expanding concentric ring electrodes which alternate between collector and generator in character .",
    "the obvious difference between this and an idba is the cylindrical nature of the diffusion .",
    "the radial component will , at least for rings of small radii , enhance the mass transport between the electrodes , leading to an increased rate of redox cycling and a greater current enhancement in comparison with linear idbas . for very large rings ,",
    "however , the diffusion will be become less cylindrical and these effects will be lost , with the behavior tending to that of parallel bands .",
    "this study investigates the extent to which this is the case , and explores how well experiments carried out at an idra can be simulated a simplified idba model .",
    "cyclic voltammetry is simulated at both linear interdigitated arrays ( idbas ) and interdigitated ring arrays ( idras ) , shown in fig [ ida schematic ] and [ idra schematic ] respectively . in each case , a single electroactive species , a , is considered to be initially present in solution , along with a large amount of an inert electrolyte to suppress electric fields and render the mass transport diffusion only .",
    "the generator electrodes are subject to a linearly sweeping potential to set up a potential dependent equilibrium between species a and its oxidised form , species b , while the collector electrodes are set at a fixed potential to reduce species b at a mass transport controlled rate : @xmath25      to simulate a linear interdigitated array , we make the assumption that the electrodes are much longer than they are wide , reducing the problem from three dimensions to two .",
    "the mass transport equation is therefore : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the concentration of species i ( mol  m@xmath15 ) and @xmath28 is the diffusion coefficient of species i ( m@xmath12  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "all symbols are defined in table [ dimensional ] .",
    "the simulation space which this is solved over is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ ida sim space]a .",
    "the mass transport equation is solved subject to boundary conditions . at the generator electrode surface ,",
    "butler - volmer kinetics are applied : @xmath29\\ ] ] and equal fluxes of species are maintained by virtue of conservation of mass : @xmath30 at the collector electrode surface , the potential is such that species b is reduced to species a and a mass transport controlled rate , and equal fluxes are again maintained : @xmath31 the edges of the simulation space are set at the centres of the electrodes ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) a distance along the y axis from the electrodes known to be well outside the diffusion layer@xcite ( @xmath34 ) where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the largest diffusion coefficient in the system , and the total time of the experiment . at the simulation edges , a zero flux condition is imposed on all species : @xmath37 the value of the potential applied to the generator electrode at a given time from the start of the experiment must also be defined .",
    "if the scan starts at some potential value @xmath38 ( v ) , and sweeps at a scan rate of @xmath39 ( v  s@xmath13 ) up to a vertex potential @xmath40 ( v ) before reversing and scanning back to @xmath38 , the the applied potential @xmath41 at any given time @xmath42 is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is used for a reduction and @xmath45 for an oxidation .",
    "the above model is next simplified by introducing normalised ( or `` dimensionless '' ) variables to make it general .",
    "the bulk concentration of species a , for example , is merely a scaling factor and is set to 1 , with all other concentrations calculated relative to this .",
    "similarly , all diffusion coefficients are set relative to @xmath46 , and all distances relative to the width of the electrode .",
    "a full list of normalised parameters and their definition is given in table [ dimensionless ] .",
    "the normalised simulation space is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ ida sim space]b . upon the substitution of dimensional parameters for normalised ones ,",
    "the mass transport equation becomes : @xmath47 the normalised boundary conditions are summarised in table",
    "[ ida boundary conditions ] . the normalised potential applied to the generator ( @xmath48 ) electrode is still a function of normalised scan rate , @xmath49 : @xmath50 again with @xmath44 used for a reduction and @xmath45 for an oxidation .      upon the implementation of the above model , the current at both the generator and the collector electrodes must be calculated .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) flux density at an individual generator electrode is given by integrating the flux across its width : @xmath51 and at the collector : @xmath52 note the factors of 2 , these are due to using the symmetry of an interdigitated array to simulate only half of an individual generator and collector electrode .",
    "the dimensional current is then given by : @xmath53 where m is the number of generator - collector pairs .",
    "to simulated an idra , the model developed above must be modified to account for the added radial nature of the diffusion .",
    "the new ( dimensionless ) mass transport equation is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dimensionless radial coordinate and @xmath56 is the dimensionless coordinate perpendicular to the surface of the electrodes , as defined in table [ dimensionless ] .",
    "[ idra sim space]a and [ idra sim space]b show schematically the dimensional and normalised simulation space",
    "this equation is to be solved over .",
    "the key difference between this simulation space and that used for the idba model ( fig .",
    "[ ida sim space ] ) is that the whole width of the generator electrode is now included in the centre , with half of the two collector electrodes on either side .",
    "the central of the simulation space is now no longer zero , but set at a value @xmath57 , determined by the geometry of the idra being simulated .",
    "some of the symmetry that was present in the idba model is lost due to the radial diffusion , which will be different on different sides of the generator electrode ( due to the different values of @xmath55 ) .",
    "the edge of the simulation space is in the centre of the collector electrodes , but unlike above where this was a result of symmetry , it is now an approximation .",
    "the boundary conditions are analogous to those used in the idba model , and are given in table [ idra boundary conditions ] .",
    "the potential applied to the generator electrode , @xmath48 , varies with time and scan rate in exactly the same way as above .      when calculating the current at an idra , it must be noted that since we are working in cyclindical coordinates , a factor of @xmath55 must be included in the integrals to calculate the overall flux .",
    "so the flux at the generator electrode is given by : @xmath58 and at the collector : @xmath59 ( the factor @xmath60 is included to normalise the response with respect to @xmath57 and make for easier comparison of ibda and idra responses . ) the dimensional current can then be obtained from the expression : @xmath61 this will give the current measured at one pair of generator - collector electrodes , at radial coordinate @xmath62 . to simulate the current measured at the entire array ,",
    "many simulations must be run , each with a different value of @xmath62 , and the results summed together .",
    "the method of crank and nicolson@xcite was used to discretise the mass transport equations and boundary conditions to allow them to be solved numerically .",
    "the alternating direction implicit method@xcite was used , in conjunction with the thomas algorithm@xcite to efficiently solve the diagonal matrices produced .",
    "the spatial grid the equations were solved over has been successfully employed previously to simulate an individual pair of parallel generator - collector microbands@xcite , as well as at arrays of discs@xcite and hemispheres@xcite in the @xmath63 direction ( for an idba , @xmath56 for and idra ) , the first grid point is at the electrode / insulating surface , and has in inital step size of @xmath64 .",
    "the grid then expands away from this surface in the following manner : @xmath65 the @xmath66 ( for an idba , @xmath55 for an idra)grid is analogous to this , with the grid expanding away from the edges of the electrodes until it meets a grid coming in the other direction ( int the centre of gaps or electrodes ) or until it meets the edge of the simulation space .",
    "the temporal grid is a regular array of points . for each unit of dimensionless potential , @xmath48 ,",
    "the grid is defined to have @xmath67 points .",
    "convergence studies found the following grid parameters sufficient to produce results within @xmath68 of a fully converged value : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "simulations were run on an intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) 2.26 ghz pc with 2.25 gb ram , with a typical running time of 20 mins per simulation .",
    "in order to compare and contrast cyclic voltammetry at idbas and idras , simulations were carried out at both geometries . a simple ,",
    "fully electrochemically reversible one electron oxidation was simulated at a generator - collector pair within an idba and compared to the same reaction simulated at a generator - collector pair in an idra with various values of @xmath57 .",
    "the results for @xmath49 values of 0.001 ( microelectrode / slow scan rate ) , 1 ( intermediate ) and 1000 ( macroelectrode / fast scan rate ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ r and sigma ] . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath72 is fixed at 0.1 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 = 1000 .",
    "it is seen that for all scan rates , a smaller value of @xmath57 enhances the dimensionless current , due to the greater radial diffusion and more efficient mass transport . as @xmath57 tends to infinity ,",
    "the idra responses converge onto the response obtained at an idba , since the electrodes become effectively linear .",
    "as expected , the collector electrode response becomes very small at large values of sigma , since in this limit the diffusion is largely planar , so species b does not diffuse outwards towards the collector electrode .",
    "it will be useful to know how much the current at a pair of electrodes in an idra deviates from that measured at an idba as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "this deviation , or current enhancement , is defined here as @xmath76 , the ratio of the peak ( or steady state ) generator current simulated in a idra simulation to that simulated at an idba electrode with equal @xmath72 . from fig .",
    "[ r and sigma ] it is seen that as @xmath57 decreases , the current enhancement ratio @xmath76 increases .",
    "fig [ scan rate effect ] shows the simulated values of @xmath76 for three values of @xmath72 ( 0.1 , 0.5 and 0.9 ) , each for the values of sigma ( 0.001 , 1 and 1000 ) .",
    "all other values remain the same as in fig [ r and sigma ] .",
    "it is seen that at small @xmath57 , @xmath76 rapidly drops off as @xmath57 increases , and approaches 1 as @xmath77 .",
    "it is also seen that , for a given value of @xmath72 , the variation of @xmath76 with @xmath57 is essentially independent of @xmath49 over six orders of magnitude ( differences between @xmath76 values for any given @xmath57 is less than 1% ) .    using these curves , it is then possible to calculate a value of @xmath57 at which @xmath76 is a specific value , for example 1.05 .",
    "any value of @xmath57 larger than this will then produce results at an idra within 5% of the reuslt for an equivalent idba .",
    "this value of @xmath57 is labled @xmath78 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 for a given @xmath72 is caluclated by performing six idra simulations with various @xmath57 which give values of @xmath76 between 1.04 and 1.06 , and fitting a polynomial equation to the @xmath76 vs @xmath57 curve using the microsoft excel graph fitting tool ( a cubic equation was found to be sufficient , higher orders produced no more accurate results ) .",
    "this equation can then be set equal to 1.05 and solved to give a value of @xmath78 .",
    "this was done for values of @xmath72 between 0.1 and 1.0 . for each @xmath72 ,",
    "a range of scan rates between 0.001 and 1000 were used , and an avergage @xmath78 taken .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ r1.05 ] .",
    "it is seen that , for this range of @xmath72 values , @xmath78 varies linearly with @xmath72 .",
    "a line of best fit was found using microsoft excel to be @xmath79 .    in an idra , the overall measured current will be dominated by the outermost electrodes , since these are largest in area .",
    "any pair of electrodes with an @xmath55 coordinate at the centre of the generator greater than @xmath78 will produce currents within 5% of those produced at an idba .",
    "hence , an idra whose outermost electrode pair satisfies this condition is likely to be able to be simulated with reasonable accuracy as an idba ( weighting each electrode pair s contribution according to its size ) .",
    "potassium ferrocyanide ( k@xmath0fe(cn)@xmath1 ) , potassium chloride ( kcl ) and nitrogen gas ( n@xmath80 ) were purchased from sigma aldrich ( usa ) and used as received , without purification .",

    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are set at 0.5 , and @xmath88 is arbitrarily set at 1000  m  s@xmath13 to ensure complete electrochemical reversibility .",
    "excellent fits are seen , validating the idba model developed above .",
    "collection efficiencies for idba1 , 2 and 3 at the vertex potential were measured as 79% , 96% and 96% .",
    "this is consistent with smaller inter electrode gaps ( relative to the electrode widths ) producing higher collection efficiencies .",
    "the cyclic voltammetry of aqueous 1 mm k@xmath0fe(cn)@xmath1 was then repeated on two pt idra electrodes ( geometries summarised in table [ geometries ] ) , again at a scan rate of 50  mv  s@xmath13 , in the presence of 0.1 m kcl .",
    "the experiments were simulated using the full idra model outlined above , and using the idba model with each pair of generator - collector electrodes having an area equal to each of the generator electrodes in the idras .",

    "for the simulations , the same literature diffusion coefficients as above were used , and in both cases the concentration of k@xmath0fe(cn)@xmath1 was fixed at 1 mm .",
    "it is seen that the two models produce very similar results , which both fit well with the experimental data , with differences likely being due to capacitative effects .",
    "the experimentally measured currents are dominated by the larger , more peripheral rings , which have small enough curvature for radial diffusion to be negligible on these timescales . for idra1",
    ", the outermost electrode pair has an @xmath57 value of 46 .",
    "the equation for @xmath78 developed above gives an @xmath78 value of 42.16 for @xmath89 , meaning this outer electrode pair can be reasonably well modelled as bands .",
    "for idra2 , the outer electrdoe pair has @xmath90 , well above the @xmath78 value of 33.18 for this geometry .",
    "this allows us to model these idras using the computationally more simplistic idba model .",
    "in this study , interdigitated band and ring electrodes were simulated and theoretical results compared .",
    "it was found that if a generator - collector pair of electrodes in a ring array has a large enough radius , the pair can be approximated as a pair of parallel linear bands .",
    "an equation has been developed for what radius this pair in a ring array needs to be to produce a result within 5% of that at parallel bands : @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 .",
    "this was found to be independant of the scan rate used .",
    "the models for interdigitated bands and rings were used to simulate experimental data for the oxidation of fe(cn)@xmath2 , and found to give good fits .",
    "it was also shown that if the inequality given above is satisfied for the outermost pair of electrodes in a ring array , then the array can be effectively modelled using the more simplistic interdigitated band array model .",
