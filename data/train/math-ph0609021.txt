    "]    the helmholtz equation in @xmath6 must be complemented by the boundary conditions ( bc ) on @xmath22 . in some cases ( for instance , when studying heat transport in @xmath6 ) the neumann bc is natural .",
    "in fact , the neumann bc presents the simplest case due to the existence of a simple ground state ( a constant ) of the problem in @xmath23  however , in many applications , the dirichlet , robin or impedance bc are more important",
    ". we shall consider ( apart from a general discussion ) only the dirichlet bc , but all the arguments and results can be modified to be applied to the problem with other bc",
    ".    an important class of domains @xmath6 are self - similar domains with only one junction and all the channels being infinite . we will call them _",
