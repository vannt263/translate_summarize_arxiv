    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) remain without a definitive model for their origin , despite their great importance in the measurement of cosmic distances @xcite and their vital role in the chemical evolution of the universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two leading models are the single degenerate scenario @xcite , in which a single white dwarf ( wd ) reaches the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath2 ) through accretion from a red giant or main sequence companion ; and the double degenerate scenario @xcite , in which a sn ia results from the inspiral and merger of a binary pair of white dwarfs .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the progenitors of type ii supernovae , sn ia progenitors are too faint to be detectable ( to date , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in archival images retrieved after the explosion .",
    "therefore , indirect arguments must be introduced in order to place limits on the likely progenitors .",
    "the single degenerate channel implies the existence of a large population of steadily accreting wds .",
    "if steady nuclear burning occurs near the surface , each of these should spend some fraction of its accretion history as a strong supersoft x - ray source ( ssss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently however , the total soft x - ray emission of elliptical galaxies was found to be far too low @xcite , and the number of observed ssss in nearby galaxies too few @xcite , for the sd scenario to hold in its standard form .",
    "population synthesis calculations have also demonstrated the great difficulty of producing a sufficient number of high - mass , accreting wds to account for a significant fraction of the sn ia rate ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and for an extreme example @xcite ) , at least given our current understanding of binary evolution .    as a possible resolution to the deficit of observed supersoft sources",
    ", @xcite suggested that a wd s photosphere is inflated in a so - called accretion wind state for much of its accretion phase .",
    "this shifts the peak of its emission from soft x - rays to the ( extreme ) uv , where it can not be directly observed due to absorption .",
    "however , for mass transfer rates @xmath3 a few @xmath4 , relevant to this scenario , the accreting wd should remain an incredibly powerful ionizing source with photospheric temperatures on the order of  @xmath5 @xcite , possibly resembling a wolf - rayet star @xcite .",
    "at least @xmath6 of nearby early type galaxies outside the virgo cluster are known to contain a detectable mass of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "the morphology of this gas ranges from irregularly distributed clouds scattered throughout the galaxy to regular disks or rings , the latter constituting the majority of h i detections .",
    "the h i disks may be confined within the stellar body of the galaxy , or extend to tens of kpc far beyond the stellar light , and have typical h i column densities on the order of @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the neutral matter are _ extended _ ( well beyond the nucleus ) regions of liner - like line emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating the presence of warm ( t @xmath10 @xmath11 k ) ionized gas .",
    "this appears to be primarily powered by a diffuse galactic background , rather than being the summation of many overlapping h ii regions .",
    "post asymptotic giant branch stars ( pagbs ) may provide the dominant contribution to the needed diffuse ionizing background @xcite .",
    "the ionizing spectra of pagbs also produce reasonable agreement with the observed optical line ratios @xcite , and appear to adequately predict the radial dependence of the inferred ionizing flux @xcite .",
    "a population of accreting white dwarfs implied by the sd scenario , with temperatures @xmath12 k would , however , introduce a substantially harder component to the ionizing background , in particular beyond the he ii photoionizing limit .",
    "the presence of such a component would dramatically change the ionization structure of the h ii gas and the line content of its emission .",
    "the greater flux of high energy ionizing photons will have a pronounced effect on several characteristic line ratios @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the total luminosity reprocessed into recombination lines of he ii should be greatly enhanced .",
    "these lines are characteristic of the youngest starbursts ( the result of ionization by wr stars ) , and are not normally observed in old stellar populations outside the innermost nuclear regions .",
    "the strongest he ii recombination line which is not capable of ionizing hydrogen , and therefore is not heavily absorbed in the ism , is the @xmath13 transition at @xmath14 . in the optical band ,",
    "the strongest line is the @xmath15 transition at @xmath16 .",
    "the strength of these lines ( or their absence ) in the optical and uv spectra of early type galaxies can be used to limit the total population of such purported sn ia progenitors , direct emission from which is unobservable , due to interstellar absorption .",
    "furthermore , contrary to upper limits from x - ray observations , such a method should in principle be strengthened if emission is primarily absorbed near the source , given the higher covering fraction and ionization parameter .    with this in mind",
    ", we explore the consequences of introducing a population of sd sn ia progenitors , which spend some fraction of their accretion history at varying temperatures typical of nuclear - burning wds .",
    "we proceed as follows : in @xmath17 , we estimate the ionizing background expected from the passively evolving ( sfr @xmath10 0 ) stellar population in early - type galaxies , and its modification due to the contribution of a putative population of accreting white dwarfs envisaged by the sd sn ia scenario . in @xmath18",
    "we consider the ionization balance in the photo - ionized gas and model the emitted spectra of these extended nebulae .",
    "in particular , we investigate how the total expected luminosity of h and he ii recombination lines should vary with age of the underlying stellar population .",
    "we demonstrate how one can then constrain the maximum luminosity which may be radiated by a population of sd progenitors at a given temperature using the predicted and observed he ii 4686  flux ( or for the latter , upper limits ) .",
    "finally , we discuss observational prospects and what implications our results have for the possible role of the sd sn ia channel , as well as whether there may be any caveats to the limits given here .",
    "in order to model the ionizing background from the underlying stellar population , we make use of the spectral evolution calculations of @xcite . for simplicity we model all passively evolving galaxies as having stellar populations born in a single burst of star formation , with initial masses distributed following @xcite . though certainly an oversimplification , focussing on such simple populations allows us to emphasize the importance of any age - dependence for the ionizing background . in practice , it is then straightforward to contruct more complex star - formation histories .    in this work , we take z = 0.05 ( @xmath10 2.5@xmath19 ) as the typical metallicity of stellar populations in early - type galaxies , consistent with the value assumed in the `` baseline '' measurement of the sn ia rate in @xcite .",
    "such a metallicity is well in line with observations of old stellar populations .",
    "although this gives a higher k - band luminosity per unit mass at any given age ( increasing the predicted number of sn ia progenitors ) , the ionizing continuum from a simple stellar population ( ssp ) is also generally higher for higher metallicities , minimizing the importance of the stellar population s metallicity ( with the continuum varying by only @xmath10 10  20% , except at the earliest ages ) . at 1gyr ,",
    "the ionizing continuum is roughly the same for 2.5@xmath20 as for @xmath20 , but the sn ia rate would be @xmath6 higher for 2.5@xmath20 .",
    "we can also make an estimate of the expected emission from sd sn ia progenitors . in the standard sd scenario ,",
    "the total mass of the wd must reach @xmath21 @xmath10 @xmath22 through accretion from either a main sequence or red giant companion . in order to avoid an accretion - induced collapse , the accretor must be a carbon - oxygen ( co ) wd . the maximum mass with which a co wd can be born is presently estimated to be approximately @xmath23 @xcite , therefore a sn ia progenitor must accrete _ at least _ @xmath24 before reaching @xmath25 .",
    "note however that the distribution of wd initial masses falls steeply with greater mass , from a peak around @xmath26 @xmath10 0.6@xmath27 , therefore the mean accreted mass per one type ia supernova can be expected to typically greatly exceed the value quoted above .",
    "the luminosity of an accreting wd is dominated by the energy release from nuclear burning of accreted matter so long as the mass transfer rate exceeds the minimum limit :    @xmath28    @xcite . below this",
    ", nuclear burning occurs only in unsteady bursts , giving rise to novae .",
    "the retention fraction of matter in this case remains highly uncertain ; even optimistic binary evolution models suggest @xmath29 @xmath1 @xmath30 may be accreted in this low-@xmath31 regime ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in such a case , sn ia progenitors would necessarily undergo many recurrent novae , in conflict with the observed rate of novae in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "assuming the steady burning condition is met , the luminosity of the accreting wd is then :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the energy release per unit mass of hydrogen ( @xmath34 erg / g ) , and @xmath35 is the mass fraction of hydrogen ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "helium burning is significantly less efficient and contributes to the luminosity only on the order of @xmath37 .    for any given wd mass",
    ", there is also a maximum accretion rate for steady burning ; when the luminosity appproaches that of a red giant the burning luminosity in eq .",
    "[ lwd ] is limited by @xcite    @xmath38    above this limit , it is not immediately apparent what becomes of the excess matter .",
    "it is possible that a thick envelope will form around the accreting wd , effectively returning it to a red giant state .",
    "however , if this is the case , it is also unlikely that the wd will be able to accrete and retain sufficient matter to produce a sn ia ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another possibility is that for any mass transfer rate greater than this , the excess matter is lost in a fast wind driven from within the wd s now significantly expanded photosphere @xcite .",

    "the case of supersoft sources ( steady nuclear burning wds ) was studied extensively by @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , despite a number of strong atmospheric absorption lines from various elements , the overall shape of their ionizing continuum does not deviate too strongly from that of a blackbody whose temperature is close to the effective sss temperature .",
