    "the insulating parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are known to have an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of cu@xmath4 spins .",
    "because of the quasi - two - dimensionality of the cu@xmath4 spin structure , these materials can show rather strong magnon heat transport at relatively high temperatures.@xcite however , the magnon transport seems to be negligible at low temperatures , probably due to the anisotropy gap of the spin spectrum .",
    "the external magnetic field can strongly suppress or close the gap at some critical fields , usually accompanied with the spin - flop transitions .",
    "it was therefore expected to observe the magnon heat transport in magnetic field.@xcite in last several years , a few works on this topic have been performed on parent compounds of electron - doped cuprate superconductors , pr@xmath5la@xmath6cuo@xmath2 ( plco ) and nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( nco).@xcite the low-@xmath7 heat transport of plco seemd to be quite simple and indicated that some paramagnetic moments such as  free \" cu@xmath4 spins can scatter phonons and lead to non - negligible magnetic - field dependence of phononic thermal conductivity.@xcite it is notable that the plco data did not indicate the possibility of magnon heat transport , although the spin - flop transition can happen for not strong in - plane fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the nco results are more complicated because of the complexity of magnetism caused by the nd@xmath3 ions.@xcite    it is known that in nco the cu@xmath4 spins order antiferromagnetically below @xmath8 k with a noncollinear magnetic structure,@xcite that is , the cu spins in the same cuo@xmath1 plane are antiferromagnetically ordered and those in the adjacent planes along the @xmath9 axis are perpendicular to each other .",
    "the moment of nd@xmath3 ion is enhanced drastically with lowering temperature and a long - range af order develops below @xmath10 1.5 k with the same noncollinear spin structure as cu@xmath4 spins.@xcite when the magnetic field is applied in the cuo@xmath1 plane , the cu@xmath4 spins can re - orientate and enter a spin - flopped state.@xcite the transition fields are reported to be 4.5 t and 0.75 t for @xmath11 and @xmath12 $ ] , respectively.@xcite in addition , the strong coupling between nd@xmath3 spins and cu@xmath4 spins , which was found to be about 4 t,@xcite drives nd@xmath3 spins to rotate together with cu@xmath4 spins , keeping their relative orientation unchanged , and forms a three - layer unit consisting of one cu@xmath4 layer sandwiched between two nd@xmath3 layers as a whole . for this reason ,",
    "the nd@xmath3 spins are generally considered to change together with cu@xmath4 sublattice under the influence of magnetic field . however , at low temperatures ( @xmath13 1.5 k ) when the af order of nd@xmath3 spins is formed , the magnetic structures and field - induced transitions of nd@xmath3 sublattice are still unclear since all the earlier neutron scattering in applied field were carried out at relatively high temperatures .",
    "two earlier studies on the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of nco have revealed strong magnetic - field dependence of @xmath0 , which was believed to be associated with the spin flop of cu@xmath4 spins.@xcite an additional conduction channel of nd@xmath3 magnons was supposed to be the reason for the enhancement of @xmath0 in high fields , considering the reorientation of nd@xmath3 spins under nd@xmath3-cu@xmath4 interaction",
    ". however , there are some quite unclear issues calling for more careful investigations .",
    "first , it is apparently questionable in ref . to attribute the large increase of @xmath0 above some transition fields to the nd@xmath3 magnons at temperatures above 2 k , where the long - range ordering of nd@xmath3 spins has been lost . in particular",
    ", the field - induced enhancement of @xmath0 is even much larger at 5 k than that at 2 k.@xcite in that work , more direct evidence for nd@xmath3 magnon transport , which should be detected below the nel transition of nd@xmath3 spins , had not been investigated .",
    "another work performing measurements down to milli - kelvin temperatures , however , did not report the magnetic - field dependent data,@xcite which is indispensable for showing the relationship between heat transport and the transition of magnetic structure . second",
    ", although the low - energy magnons can be significantly excited at the spin - flop transition and may contribute to carrying heat , because of the closure of the gap in magnon spectra , further increasing magnetic field will always shift the magnon dispersion upward and finally suppress the low - energy magnon excitations.@xcite so it is odd to assume that the magnon heat transport induced by the spin flop transition can be still active in the high - field limit.@xcite third , it was assumed that the nd@xmath3 spin lattice should rotate together with cu@xmath4 sublattice in the in - plane field .",
    "however , it is notable that the nd@xmath3-nd@xmath3 interaction can be enhanced significantly at very low temperatures due to the increased magnitude of nd@xmath3 moment , which means that the nd@xmath3 sublattice could re - orientate independently . in this work ,",
    "we study the temperature and magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath0 of high - quality nco single crystals in great detail to investigate the role of magnons in the low-@xmath7 heat transport .",
    "our results on @xmath14 isotherms demonstrate that the phonon conductivity is strongly dependent on the magnetic field , and the nd@xmath3 magnon can play a dual role in the transport as the heat carriers or the phonon scatterers .",
    "to be exact , the nd@xmath3 magnons mainly scatter phonons at the critical region ( 1@xmath102 k ) of nel transition in zero field , while they can significantly transport heat in the spin - flopped state induced by the in - plane field .",
    "intriguingly , the drastic behaviors of @xmath14 under the in - plane field reveal the spin re - orientation transitions of nd@xmath3 sublattice at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
    "high - quality nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 single crystals are grown by using the slow cooling method with cuo@xmath1 as a self flux .",
    "the plate - like samples for transport measurements are confirmed to grow along the @xmath15-plane by the x - ray back - reflection laue photographs .",
    "the dimensions along the @xmath9 axis of nco crystals are so small that the measurement with heat current along the @xmath9 axis is difficult to carry out .",
    "the thermal conductivity is therefore measured only along the @xmath16 axis by using a conventional steady - state technique and two different processes : ( i ) using a  one heater , two thermometers \" technique in a @xmath17he refrigerator and a 14 t magnet at temperature region of 0.3  8 k ; ( ii ) using a chromel - constantan thermocouple in a pulse - tube refrigerator for the zero - field data above 4 k.@xcite",

    "below 10 k , the thermal conductivity decreases quickly with lowering temperature , like usual insulators , but there is an obvious variation in slope of the @xmath20 curve around 1.5 k , which is apparently related to the af ordering of nd@xmath3 ions.@xcite however , only from the zero - field data , it is not clear whether the slope change is caused by an enhanced magnon scattering on phonons at the critical region of af phase transition or an appearance of the magnon heat transport below the transition . the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath0 is known to be useful to clarify this issue . before analyzing the @xmath14 data , we can make an estimation of the phonon mean free path ( @xmath18 ) at very low temperatures assuming that the magnons are not acting as heat carriers . following a standard calculation,@xcite @xmath18",
    "can be obtained from the kinetic formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the phonon specific heat and @xmath23 is the averaged sound velocity , and both @xmath24 and @xmath23 are known experimentally for nco.@xcite the obtained @xmath18 is compared with the averaged sample width @xmath19 (= 0.473 mm ) , which is taken to be @xmath25 times the geometrical mean width @xmath26,@xcite and shown in the inset to fig .",
    "it can be seen that the ratio @xmath27 is only about 0.4 at 0.3 k , which means that the microscopic scattering on phonons are still effective at this temperature region.@xcite note that if the magnons can contribute to carrying heat at sub - kelvin temperatures , the phonon conductivity must be smaller than the experimental data and the phonon mean free path is even smaller than the calculated value .",
    "the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of nco is further studied in the magnetic fields applied along the @xmath16 axis , the [ 110 ] direction , and the @xmath9 axis . for a low magnetic field along the @xmath16 axis , a distinct step - like transition shows up in the @xmath20 curves below 1.5 k and shifts to lower temperature with increasing field , as indicated by the 1.5 t and 2.5 t data in fig .",
    "this transition is not observable down to 0.3 k when the magnetic field is larger than 3 t. it is likely a field - induced af - ferromagnetic ( spin polarized ) transition of nd@xmath3 ions . in the strongest field",
    "( 14 t ) we applied , the low-@xmath7 conductivities are increased and a nearly @xmath28 dependence is presented , which explicitly indicates that there is strong magnon - phonon scattering in the zero field and the scattering is almost smeared out in the high field .",
    "this can also be verified from the inset to fig .",
    "2(a ) that the phonon mean free path in the 14 t field , which is much larger than that in the zero field , increases with lowering temperature and approaches the averaged sample width at 0.3 k , demonstrating that the boundary scattering limit of phonons is nearly established in the 14 t field and at such low temperatures.@xcite for magnetic field applied along the [ 110 ] direction , a similar result to the @xmath16-axis - field case is that the 14 t field can also significantly enhance the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity ; in particular , the thermal conductivity at the lowest temperature is almost the same as that in 14 t @xmath29 .",
    "however , there seems no af - ferromagnetic transition of nd@xmath3 ions for @xmath30 [ 110 ] , as shown in fig .",
    "when the @xmath9-axis field is applied , the thermal conductivities display the most complex dependence on temperature , as shown in fig .",

    "3 . one can see from figs .",
    "3(e ) and 3(f ) that as the @xmath9-axis field increases , @xmath0 is decreased first and then increased at high - enough field , which results in a broad  valley \" in the low-@xmath7 @xmath14 isotherms .",
    "since both the cu@xmath4 spin structure and the nd@xmath3 spin structure are not changeable for @xmath31,@xcite this observation can only be attributed to the paramagnetic moments . in this",
    "regard , the shifting of the position of the @xmath14 minimum to higher field with increasing temperature is indeed compatible with the typical behaviors of the paramagnetic moments scattering on phonons.@xcite in nco , the  free \" spins at very low temperatures can be either the spin vacancies / defects on the long - range - ordered cu@xmath4 spin lattice or those on the ordered nd@xmath3 spin lattice . it is known from the earlier studies on plco and gdbaco@xmath1o@xmath32 that whether the high - field - limit conductivities are larger than the zero - field values is determined by the condition whether the magnetic ions have the zero - field energy splitting.@xcite since the low-@xmath7 @xmath0 in the high - field limit is apparently larger than those in zero field , it is likely that the  free \" spins on the nd@xmath3 sites , whose ground - state doublet can be split in the zero field,@xcite rather than the cu@xmath4 free spins,@xcite are responsible for scattering phonons . in addition , it is clear that the decrease of @xmath0 in the 14 t field above 5 k , in contrast to the increase below 2 k , is simply because the field is not strong enough to remove the paramagnetic scattering.@xcite note that the paramagnetic moments scattering on phonons seems to be much more significant in nco than that in plco.@xcite    the phonon scattering by paramagnetic moments is known to be qualitatively isotropic for different field directions,@xcite so the similar @xmath14 behaviors to those for @xmath31 should also contribute to the @xmath14 data for @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , at relatively high temperatures above @xmath10 2 k , the profiles of @xmath14 for @xmath34 or [ 110 ] could still be understood in the picture of paramagnetic scattering , whereas at lower temperatures ( @xmath35 1 k ) the @xmath14 isotherms display very different behaviors , which manifests that some other mechanisms are taking place .",
    "for @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath0 shows a step - like increase at @xmath10 0.6 t and a weak field dependence above this transition field , as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath11 is remarkably more complicated .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) , at sub - kelvin temperatures , except for a sudden increase at @xmath10 1 t there is a sharp drop at @xmath10 2.5 t. one possible mechasim for these complicated @xmath14 behaviors is naturally related to the transitions of spin structures induced by the in - plane field .",
    "it is known that the @xmath16-axis field and the [ 110 ] field cause the spin - flop transitions of the cu@xmath4 sublattice at @xmath10 4.5 t and 0.75 t , respectively.@xcite apparently , these re - orientations have weak effects on the heat transport , since there is only a very small dip in @xmath14 curves at 4.5 t for @xmath11 , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and the effect for @xmath30 [ 110 ] is not distinguishable from the strong increase of @xmath0 at 0.6 t. therefore , the low - field anomalies of @xmath14 for @xmath11 or [ 110 ] are most likely caused by the transitions of the nd@xmath3 sublattice , which have never been explored in experiments at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
    "cuo@xmath2 in the magnetic fields along two different in - plane directions .",
    "( a ) spin structure in the zero field .",
    "( b - d ) spin structures in the magnetic field along the @xmath16 axis . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the critical fields of the spin flop and the spin polarization transitions of the nd@xmath3 spins , respectively .",
    "( e ) spin structure in the magnetic field along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "@xmath39}$](cu ) and @xmath40}$](cu ) are the spin - flop transition fields of the cu@xmath4 spins for @xmath11 and [ 110 ] , respectively.,width=321 ]    the above @xmath14 behaviors can suggest the evolution of nd@xmath3 spin structure ( at sub - kelvin temperatures ) for the in - plane magnetic fields , which are summarized in fig .",
    "4 . in principle , whether the nd sublattice rotates together with the cu@xmath4 spins depends on the competition between nd@xmath3-cu@xmath4 and nd@xmath3-nd@xmath3 interactions . as already known ,",
    "nco exhibits a noncollinear structure in the zero field , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . with increasing field along the @xmath16 axis ,",
    "the nd@xmath3 ions are possible to make spin rotations if the field is large enough . as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , when @xmath41 1 t ) those nd@xmath3 spins pointing along the field direction could rotate by 90@xmath42 in the @xmath15 plane , in other words , a spin flop transition of nd@xmath3 ions happens .",
    "it is known that the low - energy magnons are usually well populated at the spin flop transition due to the close of the magnon gap,@xcite and meanwhile @xmath0 shows a sudden increase at the transition field .",
    "it is therefore natural to conclude that the nd@xmath3 magnons act as heat carriers at very low temperatures and hence make a positive contribution to the thermal conductivity . if the magnetic field increases further , the nd@xmath3 spins gradually turn to the direction of applied field and are finally polarized at @xmath43 ( @xmath10 2.5 t ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(c ) , which corresponds to a dip in @xmath14.@xcite after that the thermal conductivity starts to recover due to the weakening of magnon scattering on phonons . at @xmath10 4.5 t , the cu@xmath4 spin flop happens and the spin directions are switched to be perpendicular to the field .",
    "this field strength can destroy the intra - unit nd@xmath3-cu@xmath4 interaction , therefore nd@xmath3 spins can no longer rotate together with cu@xmath4 spins and keep the alignment along the @xmath16 axis , as shown in fig .",
    "note that in the high - field limit , the roles of magnons as either heat carriers or phonon scatterers are inactive and the plateau of @xmath14 also indicates that the paramagnetic scattering on phonons is smeared out , as the 14 t @xmath20 data indicate .    in the case of @xmath12 $ ] ,",
    "there is also a sharp increase of @xmath0 at @xmath10 0.6 t and the magnitude of increase is almost the same as the increase at 1 t @xmath29 .",
    "this strongly suggests a magnon heat - transport contribution appearing at this critical field , which is essentially the same as that for the cu@xmath4 spin reorientation ( @xmath10 0.75 t in some former reports).@xcite since this field strength is much smaller than the nd@xmath3-cu@xmath4 interaction , it is expectable that the nd@xmath3 spins rotate together with the cu@xmath4 spins and thereby align along the field direction , as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , the low - energy nd@xmath3 magnons are well populated at this spin flop transition and are able to significantly transport heat .",
    "it is notable that there is no dip - like feature in higher fields , which indicates that the nd@xmath3 spin polarization does not happen .",
    "this is supported by the @xmath20 in fig .",
    "2(b ) , where there is no af - ferromagnetic transition behavior similar to those in fig .",
    "it is useful to make a quantitative estimation on the nd@xmath3 magnon heat transport from the above data .",
    "for example , the step - like increases of @xmath0 at 0.36 k is about 0.7 times the zero - field value , which gives a magnon thermal conductivity of 0.0441 w / km , for both @xmath11 and @xmath44 [ 110 ] . taking a theoretical prediction of the velocity of nd@xmath3 magnons , @xmath10 10 mev(no experimental observation so far),@xcite and assuming the ballistic transport of magnons at such low temperature,@xcite",
    "we can obtain the magnon mean free path of about 0.16 mm .",
    "this value is quite reasonable since it is in the same order of magnitude of the averaged sample width ( 0.473 mm ) .    with above understandings on both the paramagnetic scattering and the magnon heat transport associated with spin - structure transitions",
    ", one can get a complete picture of the @xmath14 isotherms for the in - plane fields . at sub - kelvin temperatures , the sharp increase and the  dip \" at low fields along the @xmath16 axis",
    "are mainly related to the magnon behaviors , while the high - field enhancement and the plateau feature are due to the disappearance of paramagnetic scattering . on the other hand , the step increase at low fields along [ 110 ]",
    "mainly results from the magnon heat transport , and the gradual increase of @xmath0 at higher field up to @xmath10 6 t is likely due to the weakening of paramagnetic scattering ; furthermore , the slow decrease of @xmath0 at field above 6 t is related to the suppression of low - energy magnon excitations in very high fields .    in passing ,",
    "it is worthy of pointing out that at 1@xmath102 k the thermal conductivity is most strongly recovered at very high in - plane field .",
    "it seems to be related to the temperature dependence of magnon excitations ( nd@xmath3 ) ; that is , at @xmath35 1 k , the magnon population is negligibly small in zero field because of the magnon gap , while at 1@xmath102 k , the critical region of nd@xmath3 af transition , the spin fluctuations are significant and scatter phonons rather strongly .",
    "so in this temperature region the zero - field phonon transport is most strongly damped by not only the paramagnetic moments but also the magnetic excitations and it can be remarkably recovered by applying high in - plane field .",
    "it is intriguing to compare the present work with the earlier ones .",
    "it has been concluded from the very - low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity in the zero field and strong in - plane field , which is much higher than the cu@xmath4 spin - flop transition , that the high - field - induced enhancement of @xmath0 is a direct contribution from nd@xmath3 magnon heat transport.@xcite the present data essentially support the capability of nd@xmath3 magnon transporting heat , but only in relatively low fields .",
    "base on the detailed field dependence of @xmath0 , particularly for @xmath45 , it is able to be clarified that the enhancement of @xmath0 at very high fields is mainly due to the weakening of paramagnetic scattering on phonons .",
    "the reason that the earlier work did not notice the importance of paramagnetic scattering is that the @xmath20 data for @xmath31 were taken only at 10 t for the comparison with the in - plane - field data.@xcite it is a coincidence that in this field , the thermal conductivities in the whole temperature range are not likely to be larger than the zero - field values , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , the present data provide a very important supplement to the earlier works and lead to a more accurate conclusion .",
    "in summary , we study the heat transport of a parent insulator of high-@xmath46 superconductors nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 at low temperatures down to 0.3 k and in magnetic fields up to 14 t. it is found that in zero field the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity is purely phononic with rather strong scatterings from paramagnetic moments and nd@xmath3 magnetic excitations . in high magnetic field along either the @xmath9 axis or the @xmath15 plane , the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity can be significantly enhanced because of the weakening of magnetic scattering .",
    "an interesting finding is the drastic changes of @xmath0 at low fields along the @xmath16 axis or the [ 110 ] direction , which demonstrates the field - induced spin flop or spin polarization of nd@xmath3 spin lattice . at sub - kelvin temperatures",
    ", the nd@xmath3 magnons can act as heat carriers in the spin - flopped state , however , their transport can exist only in some intermediate field regime and is suppressed by an succeeding spin - polarization transition for @xmath11 . in the field along the [ 110 ] direction , the magnon transport can be active in a broader field region but is also weakened in very high field .",
    "an evolution of the magnetic structure with the in - plane field can be suggested based on these field dependencies of @xmath0 .",
    "one may note that although the magnons can hardly affect the phonon heat transport for those superconducting samples , because of the disappearance of the long - range af order , the paramagnetic moments can still effectively scatter phonons .",
