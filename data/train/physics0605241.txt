    "the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is a new photodetector developed by hamamatsu photonics , japan  @xcite .",
    "an mppc consists of many ( 100 to @xmath21000 ) small avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) in an area of typically 1  mm@xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mppc - photo ] shows a picture of an mppc with 100 pixels .",
    "each apd micropixel independently works in limited geiger mode with an applied voltage a few volts above the breakdown voltage ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "when a photoelectron is produced , it induces a geiger avalanche .",
    "the avalanche is passively quenched by a resistor integral to each pixel .",
    "the output charge @xmath5 from a single pixel is independent of the number of produced photoelectrons within the pixel , and can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the applied voltage and @xmath8 is the capacitance of the pixel . combining the output from all the pixels , the total charge from an mppc",
    "is quantized to multiples of @xmath5 and proportional to the number of pixels that underwent geiger discharge ( `` _ _ fired _ _ '' ) .",
    "the number of fired pixels is proportional to the number of injected photons if the number of photons is small compared to the total number of pixels .",
    "thus , the mppc has an excellent photon counting capability .        for the mppc ,",
    "the operation voltage @xmath7 is a few volts above the breakdown voltage and well below 100  v. the pixel capacitance @xmath8 is on the order of 10100  ff , giving a gain of 10@xmath910@xmath1 .",
    "these features enable us to read out the signal from the mppc with simple electronics .",
    "in addition , because the thickness of the amplification region is a few @xmath10 m , it is insensitive to an applied magnetic field and the response is fast .",
    "because of these great advantages , several particle physics experiments are going to use the mppc .",
    "the t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka ) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment  @xcite , which is now under construction and will start in 2009 , has chosen the mppc as one of the baseline photosensors for the near neutrino detector complex .",
    "calorimeters for the international linear collider are another project that is considering use of the mppc  @xcite . in these experiments , mppcs will be used to detect photons from plastic scintillators guided by wavelength - shifting fibers . with larger area devices or a light collection system ,",
    "the mppc may be used for the aerogel - rich particle identification system in a b - factory upgrade  @xcite .",
    "the features of mppcs are suitable not only for particle physics experiments but for much wider applications such as astrophysics , space science , material science , or medical instruments .",
    "the mppc is a newly developed device and its performance is rapidly improving . in this report , the latest status of the development and future prospects are presented .",
    "we have tested two types of the latest samples of mppcs produced by hamamatsu photonics .",
    "the difference between them is the number of pixels ",
    "one has 100 pixels with a 100  @xmath10 m pitch and the other has 400 pixels with a 50  @xmath10 m pitch .",
    "a device with a 25  @xmath10 m pitch and 1600 pixels is also being tested , although not reported here .",

    "the basic performance of the mppc is measured with light from an led .",
    "all results shown in this section are for a sample 400 pixel device .      figure  [ fig : raw - signal](a ) shows the raw signal from an mppc taken with an oscilloscope .",
    "the mppc is illuminated by pulsed light from an led at low intensity and the oscilloscope is triggered in synch with the led pulse .",

    "figure  [ fig : raw - signal](b ) shows the output charge read out by an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) .",
    "the charge corresponding to different numbers of fired pixels is again well separated ( or quantized ) as peaks in the adc distribution at equal intervals .",

    "the gain is defined as @xmath5 divided by the charge of an electron .",

    "[ fig : noise ] .",
    "the horizontal axis in fig .  [ fig : noise ] shows the difference between the applied voltage and the breakdown voltage @xmath4 .",
    "the breakdown voltage is derived by linearly extrapolating the gain - voltage curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain ] to the point where the gain becomes zero . with a threshold equivalent to 0.5 photoelectrons ( p.e . ) , the noise rate is 0.51  mhz .",

    "threshold is @xmath14%/@xmath11c .",
    "these observations imply that the dominant component of the noise is due to the discharge of single pixels induced by thermally generated carriers .",
    "we have tested three samples of mppcs of the same type . although the number of the tested devices is limited , we find that the device - by - device variation of the characteristics is small : with an applied voltage of 68.8  v , the maximum difference in the gain is less than 3% , while that of the noise rate is about 7% .",

    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the cross - talk between neighboring micropixels has been observed .",
    "the origin of the cross - talk is presumed to be optical photons emitted during avalanche  @xcite which enter neighboring micropixels and trigger another geiger discharge .",
    "the probability of causing cross - talk is estimated from the fraction of events with more than one p.e . to that with one p.e . in randomly triggered events without external light .",
    "we assume that the events with more than one p.e .",
    "are caused by the cross - talk from the original geiger discharge in a single pixel .",
    "the effect from accidental coincidence of two independent discharges is estimated from the fraction of pedestal events , assuming a poisson distribution for the original geiger discharge , and has been subtracted .",
    "figure  [ fig : crosstalk ] shows the cross - talk probability as a function of the applied voltage above @xmath4 .",
    "the cross - talk probability is found to be almost independent of the temperature .",
    "however , it depends on the applied voltage .",
    "the measured cross - talk probability is at an acceptable level for certain applications ( e.g. for the t2k neutrino experiment ) .",
    "however , for applications that require good linearity with wide dynamic range ( e.g. ilc calorimeters ) , this may limit the performance of the device , and improvement may be necessary .",
    "the photon detection efficiency ( pde ) is an important parameter for the performance of the mppc . for an mppc",
    ", the pde is written as a product of three effects : @xmath16 the geometrical efficiency @xmath17 represents the fraction of active area in a micropixel .",
    "it depends on the design and the size of a pixel , but is about 0.5 for current samples .",

    "events to the total number of trigger , assuming a poisson distribution . for the pmt",
    ", the number of photoelectrons is calculated by dividing the mean output charge by the charge corresponding to 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pde ] shows the results of the measurement at 15@xmath11c .",
    "the pde of the mppc for green light is about or more than twice the qe of the pmt .",
    "a measurement of the absolute pde with a calibrated photodiode will be done in the near future .",
    "the linearity of the mppc response to a large amount of light is intrinsically limited by the finite number of micropixels .",
    "figure  [ fig : linearity ] shows the number of fired pixels of an mppc as a function of light intensity .",
    "the number of generated photoelectrons inside the active area is estimated by the intensity of the light monitored by a pmt .",
    "the red curve shows the expected response of the mppc based on the known number of pixels and the measured cross - talk probability .",
    "the deviation from the expected curve is found to be within 5% .",
    "thus , the response of the mppc is well described by the number of pixels and measured cross - talk rate .",
    "in order to check the response of each micro apd pixel , we have tested the mppc with a pulsed laser system .",

    "figure  [ fig : laser-1pix ] shows the measured response for one pixel . because we do not know the number of injected photons in this measurement , the @xmath19 axis is arbitrary and show the relative response .",
    "it is found that the response is uniform within the active area of the micropixel .",
