    "in this report based on the talk  @xcite , elements of the status of supersymmetry are discussed . in a supersymmetric theory",
    "@xcite each fermionic degree of freedom has a bosonic counter part and vice versa .",
    "supersymmetry has no problems with radiative corrections due to the cancellation of quadratic divergences .",
    "a light higgs boson with a mass of less than about 150  gev is predicted .",
    "supersymmetry paves a path to including gravity in the theory of elementary particles .",
    "the particle spectrum of a supersymmetric theory consists of at least three neutral higgs bosons , two or more charged higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles such as the sleptons , squarks , the neutralinos , the charginos and the gluino .",
    "r0.5     the origin of supersymmetry breaking is not known today . several models parametrize this ignorance , among them : the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , decoupled scalars supersymmetry ( dss ) .",
    "other models such as the nmssm , the mrssm and the n=1/n=2 hybrid model add further fields ( particles ) to the minimal particle content of the mssm .",
    "r  parity is assumed to be conserved in the following .",
    "thus supersymmetric particles are produced in pairs and cascade decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the lsp is stable , neutral and weakly interacting , for the lightest neutralino will be used .",
    "the general experimental signature for the detection of supersymmetry at colliders is missing transverse energy .",
    "supersymmetry stabilizes the gap between the electroweak and planck scales , unifies the couplings of the three forces , can induce electroweak symmetry breaking , provides a link to physics at the gut scale and a candidate for dark matter .",
    "experimentally the electroweak data favor a light higgs boson , compatible with supersymmetry as shown in figure  [ fig : mwmt ] for the w  boson mass as function of the top quark mass .",
    "r0.5        a typical parameter set for vintage msugra studies is sps1a  @xcite .",
    "sps1a has moderately heavy gluinos and squarks , heavy and light gauginos and the lightest higgs boson at the lep limit .",
    "important for the lhc , the long cascade @xmath0 is detectable  @xcite .",
    "while this choice of parameters was initially thought to be optimistic , it has been shown  @xcite that today s electroweak precision data together with the relic density measurement and rare b branching ratios result in a best  fit msugra parameter point quite close to sps1a as shown in figure  [ fig : sps1aindirect ] .",
    "the parameter set sps1a has been analyzed in detail for measurements at the lhc and ilc . at the lhc",
    "the squark sector , gluinos , sleptons and part of the neutralino sector can be discovered .",
    "edges and thresholds are observed in invariant mass distributions .",
    "these are functions of the intervening masses and do not depend on the underlying theory .",
    "as soon as the production threshold is passed at the ilc , the particle can be measured .",
    "transforming the measurements into a determination of the underlying parameters is a formidable task for which sophisticated tools are necessary .",
    "an overview of the tools for supersymmetric predictions such as masses , production cross sections and branching ratios can be found in  @xcite .",
    "fittino  @xcite and sfitter  @xcite provide different techniques to sample a multi - dimensional parameter space with correlated measurements .",
    "weighted markov chains can be used for efficient sampling of a high dimensional parameter space as it is essentially linear in the number of parameters . after having produced a full  dimensional exclusive likelihood map , two options of projections",
    "can be explored : marginalization ( bayesian ) , which introduces a measure , or the profile likelihood ( frequentist ) approach of choosing the parameter with the maximum log - likelihood value .    a first example is the determination of the msugra parameters as an illustration of a model with few parameters which are ( mostly ) defined at the gut scale .",
    "the correct parameter set is found from the measurements , but the markov chains also locate secondary minima in this tightly constrained scenario .",
    "one of the secondary minima results from the interplay of the top quark mass and the trilinear coupling a@xmath1 .",
    "it is important that the standard model parameters are determined coherently including their experimental errors .",
    "the secondary minima can be eliminated by comparing the log - likelihood values which are larger for the correct solution .",
    "after having determined the central values of the parameters , the errors on the parameters have to be determined either in a single fit or by using toy experiments .",
    "theory errors are considered to be flat in contrast to the experimental errors which are treated as gaussian and can have strong correlations in the systematic part . with this rigorous treatment of the errors ,",
    "the expected errors at the lhc are of the order of percent or better and are improved by a factor of three or four when the expected results from the ilc are included .",
    "the inclusion of theory errors in the analysis has an impact on the precision not only on the ilc errors , but also on the lhc errors ( precision is decreased approximately by a factor three ) .",
    "r0.5        the mssm is defined at the electroweak scale with up to about 120 parameters . including phenomenological constraints ( absence of fcnc etc ) ,",
    "the parameters can be reduced to 19  parameters .",
    "the larger parameter space necessitates a thorough search for secondary minima .",
    "only three gaugino masses can be observed at the lhc in sps1a , in the mssm the gaugino / higgsino sector is therefore under - constrained resulting in a eightfold ambiguity ( see figure  [ fig : sfitterm1 ] ) in this sector where the log - likelihood values are essentially identical . adding the ilc measurements to the analysis , all parameters can be determined and the ambiguities can be resolved .",
    "the mssm also has the particular advantage that once the parameters have been determined , they can be extrapolated to the high scale , thus measuring grand unification instead of imposing it as shown by  @xcite .",
    "once the supersymmetric parameters have been determined either in msugra or the mssm , the full spectrum and the couplings can be deduced . calculating the relic density from this information ,",
    "a collider prediction for @xmath2h@xmath3 is obtained  @xcite . in the parameter set sps1a from lhc data alone , ignoring theory errors ,",
    "a precision of about 2% can be obtained , adding ilc measurements the precision would improve by an order of magnitude .",
    "the precision , albeit depending strongly on the exact phenomenology of supersymmetry , is comparable to that of wmap and the expectation of planck .",
    "confronting these two measurements will provide for interesting studies in the future .",
    "in the nmssm a singlet is added to the mssm in order to generate the @xmath4  term dynamically .",
    "the higgs sector is extended to five neutral higgs boson and an additional neutralino is present . the price to be paid",
    "are additional parameters . in the cnmssm",
    "@xcite the number of parameters is reduced by requiring unification of the breaking parameters similar to msugra and the correct mass of the z boson .",
    "this leaves four parameters . additionally imposing the necessary non  zero minimum value of the higgs potential favors low m@xmath1 .",
    "requiring also the absence of tachyons induces the tri  linear coupling to be negative . adding in the lep constraints , the correct relic density ( stau assisted annihilation ) and the measurement of @xmath5 , the model reduces to lines in the ( m@xmath6,a@xmath1 ) plane for low m@xmath1 as shown in figure  [ fig : cnmssm ] .",
    "the prediction for the phenomenology at the lhc is that the stau lepton is the almost stable nlsp .",
    "thus an interesting and a bit unusual signature to be studied by atlas and cms .",
    "r0.5    recently theoretical studies of the lhc potential for sgluons have been performed  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath7 scalar particles appear when joining the gauge multiplet with an n=2 type chiral multiplet in order to expand majorana to dirac gauginos  @xcite .",
    "examples of such models are the @xmath8 hybrid model and the mrssm  @xcite .",
    "the production cross section for sgluon pair production could be 10  times larger than those of scalar quarks thus being potentially interesting for rapid discovery / exclusion at the lhc .",
    "experimental signatures are for example ( cascade via gluinos , then squark  quark followed by a squark to neutralino plus quark decay ) eight jets with large transverse momenta ( plus missing transverse momentum due to 4  lsps ) or like - sign top quark pairs .",
    "the influence of qcd ",
    "isr was studied and found not to interfere with a sgluon mass measurement once only jets with transverse momenta of more than 100  gev are required .",
    "the exact opposite of the exciting scenario of observing large supersymmetric signals at the lhc would be to observe only a single neutral higgs boson with a mass of about 120  gev . in this case several decay channels would be open and similar to the full supersymmetric case , these measurements will be strongly correlated and theoretical errors will have to be taken into account .",
    "thus again the search techniques described in the previous section can be applied to the determination of the higgs boson couplings  @xcite .",
    "the analysis critically depends on the determination of the higgs boson coupling to b  quarks . in figure",
    "[ fig : subjet ] the impact of the newly proposed subjet analysis  @xcite is shown .",
    "the impact of this analysis is very important as the previous golden channel tth(h@xmath9bb ) has turned out to be more difficult and less sensitive recently  @xcite . determining the higgs couplings in a scenario close to the sps1a definition , modifying m@xmath10 , @xmath11 and a@xmath12 to move out of the decoupling regime ,",
    "the log - likelihood is used as estimator with all correlations : the standard model interpretation the montecarlodata can be excluded at 90%  c.l . for 77% of the toy experiments , showing the good sensitivity of the higgs sector to new physics .",
    "supersymmetry remains an attractive candidate for new physics at the tev scale .",
    "the lhc could provide a wealth of measurements of supersymmetry and is ready for difficult scenarios .",
    "collider dark matter property predictions could be comparable in precision to the relic density measurements from wmap and planck .",
    "the future will tell ...",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of the session _ electroweak physics and beyond the standard model _ for the invitation and the organizers of dis09 for the wonderful conference .",
    "part of the work was developed in the french gdr terascale ( cnrs ) .",
