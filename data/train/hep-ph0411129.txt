    "softly broken supersymmetric models contain a fairly large number of scalar fields not present in the standard model .",
    "their existence leads to a complicated scalar potential , which might contain undesirable minima which spontaneously break charge and/or color symmetry , a situation which can not happen within the standard model .",
    "the condition that the `` realistic '' minimum is the global minimum of the theory can be used to obtain restrictions on the parameter space of supersymmetric models , as already realized more than 20 years ago @xcite . this way",
    "a disadvantage of supersymmetry may turn into a virtue by shedding some light into the unknown supersymmetry breaking mechanism itself .    due to the enormous complexity of the full scalar potential in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) early papers on this subject  @xcite",
    "have only analyzed particular , but especially dangerous directions in field  space .",
    "casas et al @xcite have presented a more detailed analysis of this subject .",
    "they were able to show that in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) with minimal supergravity boundary conditions strong constraints arise ruling out sizeable parts of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "similar studies in r  parity violating versions of the mssm , however , have not been published  .",
    "our main goal is to present a detailed analysis of the unbounded  from ",
    "below ( ufb ) as well as charge / colour breaking minima ( ccb ) in the bilinear r ",
    "parity breaking model ( rmssm )  @xcite .",
    "this model breaks lepton number and r  parity explicitly through the simplest bilinear terms .",
    "the justification for such emphasis is threefold .",
    "first , it represents the simplest possible scheme of r  parity violation , a mere six parameter extension of the mssm .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the `` stability '' of the mssm against such `` innocuous '' perturbation .",
    "for this reason we can also call this model the generalized mssm where r  parity breaks in the minimal way .",
    "second , this model is motivated by the fact that it produces the paradigm for the idea that supersymmetry is the origin of neutrino mass  @xcite , leading to a pattern of neutrino masses  @xcite that successfully describes current neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , it represents the only model of r ",
    "parity breaking consistent with a spontaneous violation of r ",
    "parity  @xcite , where it is the vacuum , not the fundamental theory , that breaks the symmetry .    in this model",
    "the atmospheric neutrino mass scale @xcite is generated at the tree ",
    "level , through the mixing of the three neutrinos with the neutralinos  @xcite , in an effective ` low ",
    "scale' variant of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the solar mass and mixings needed to account for solar neutrino data  @xcite are generated radiatively  @xcite .",
    "a very important difference between such a supersymmetric approach to the origin of neutrino mass and seesaw  type schemes , is that here the dimension  five operator responsible for ( majorana ) neutrino masses is generated at an accessibly low energy scale  namely the weak scale .",
    "this makes this model potentially testable by experiment .",
    "in fact it has been shown that such a low  scale scheme for neutrino masses has the advantage of being testable also `` outside '' the realm of neutrino physics experiments .",
    "although neutrino properties can not be predicted from first principles , interpreting current neutrino data in this framework implies unambiguous tests of the theory at accelerator experiments  @xcite which can potentially be used to falsify the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will briefly recall some basics of the discussion on ccb and ufb bounds in the mssm .",
    "this will serve as a basis for section 3 , where we will discuss new features related to the r  parity violating terms .",
    "we show how the bounds from unbounded  from  below directions have to be modified , once non  zero bilinear r  parity violating ( brpv ) terms are allowed .",
    "we point out the novel possibility to generate a non ",
    "zero vacuum expectation value of the charged higgs field , albeit in regions of parameter space which are now excluded by neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "we show that , given current data on neutrino masses , bilinear r ",
    "parity violation can be understood as a small perturbation of the mssm . from the point of view of charge breaking minima",
    "the rmssm is thus as safe ( or unsafe ) as the mssm itself .",
    "we will then close with a short summary .",

    ". can be negative . even though in msugra at very large @xmath21 values @xmath20 can occur in exceptional cases",
    ", we will follow their assumption .",
    "] therefore the minimum of the higgs potential occurs for vanishing vev of the charged higgs boson .    by using the minimization equations , @xmath22     0&=&-2 b \\mu v_u + 2 \\left(m^2_{h_d } + \\mu^2\\right ) v_d + \\frac{1}{2 }",

    "( [ eq:8 ] ) will be important to compare with the values of other ( and potentially deeper ) minima .    before starting the discussion of the dangerous directions ,",
    "a word of caution should be added , namely , that the condition that the realistic minimum is the global one might actually be too conservative .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the universe resides in a false vacuum which is stable because the tunneling time into the global minimum is large with respect to the age of the universe . in this sense ,",
    "ccb and ufb constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space are sufficient but might not be necessary , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , we will not follow this line of reasoning any further .      the unbounded  from  below ( ufb ) directions are those where the quartic d  terms vanish and some coefficient(s ) quadratic in the vev s are negative",
    ". then the potential at the weak scale seems to be unbounded from below .",
    "however , this is a slight misnomer , since if one assumes that all soft masses are positive at the high unification scale , it appears that these dangerous directions are not really unbounded from below but there exists a true local minimum at some large scale .",
    "it then must be checked that this local minimum is not deeper than the physical one . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite there are three kinds of such directions .",
    "the first and most obvious one corresponds to the d ",
    "flat direction where @xmath24 , all other vev s being zero .",
    "the potential along this direction reads , @xmath25 and a sufficient condition to avoid developping a deep minimum at large values of the field is @xmath26 in principle , one should check the depth of the true minimum along the dangerous direction when this coefficient is negative . for simplicity",
    ", we will stick however to the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the second dangerous direction corresponds to the case where a slepton @xmath27 takes a vev @xmath28 .",
    "then a combination of @xmath29 and @xmath28 can cancel the d  term and the potential reads , @xmath30 which constrains the coefficient of the quadratic term as @xmath31 note that in the case of a universal @xmath32 at the unification scale the @xmath33 are usually the smallest soft masses at the weak scale . dropping the universality assumption the bound obtained for @xmath33 ,",
    "( [ eq : ufb2 ] ) , must be verified for the squark soft masses as well .",
    "finally the last ufb direction corresponds to the case where @xmath34 but we have a neutral slepton @xmath27 with nonzero vev , like in the ufb-2 case .",
    "this direction is both d and f  flat .",
    "the difference with respect to ufb-2 is that the f  term is canceled by giving vev s to the charged sleptons .",
    "the resulting potential reads @xmath35 since @xmath36 must be negative in order to break electroweak symmetry and @xmath37 is small when one assumes universality of the soft terms , the coefficient quadratic in @xmath38 is generally negative . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite in the case of universal soft masses at the gut scale , the condition that the minimum along this ufb-3 direction is not deeper than the physical minimum implies @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a coefficient of @xmath41 .      for the classical ccb minima ,",
    "dangerous negative contributions to the scalar potential are generated by cubic ( @xmath42type ) soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "therefore these directions can not be f ",
    "flat , but they are still d  flat .",
    "the traditional bound of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the case where @xmath43 all other vev s vanishing .",
    "this choice cancels the d  term and the potential reads , @xmath44 in order to avoid a very deep color and charge breaking minimum we must make sure that the parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) never vanishes , which happens if the corresponding second order equation can not have real solutions .",
    "this leads to the well known condition , @xmath45 a more complete and general analysis of this and similarly dangerous directions can be found in ref .",
    "note again , that the bound given in eq.([eq:16 ] ) for @xmath46 must be checked for all @xmath42terms in the general non  universal mssm .",
    "the rmssm is simply the bilinear r  parity violating model , defined by the following superpotential  @xcite @xmath47 and corresponding soft supersymmetry breaking terms , @xmath48 it is therefore a rather mild extension of the mssm . in the following",
    "it will be sufficient to consider for simplicity only a one generation version of the model   and intergenerational effects between different families of leptons due to brpv terms scale as @xmath49 . ] .",
    "we are mainly interested in studying how the appearance of the new terms in the superpotential ( and in @xmath50 ) changes the conclusions which hold for the mssm . since the mssm is the limit of the rmssm when @xmath51 we expect that the results of the mssm will hold in that limit .",
    "note also that the structure of the trilinear terms is not modified , so conclusions like those of eq .",

    "<S> we reconsider the possible presence of charge and colour breaking minima in the scalar potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its minimal generalization with r  parity explicitly broken by bilinear terms ( rmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> first we generalize some results previously derived for the mssm case . </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate how robust is the mssm against its rmssm extension . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the constraints on the rmssm parameter space that follow from the required absence of charge breaking minima in the scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the possibility of generating non  zero vacuum expectation values for the charged higgs field which is not present in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the smallness of neutrino masses indicated by neutrino oscillation data , we show that the rmssm represents only a slight perturbation of the mssm and is thus as safe ( or unsafe ) as the mssm itself from unwanted minima in the scalar potential . </S>"
