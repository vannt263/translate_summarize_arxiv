    "the loose clustering of galaxies surrounding centaurus a was called the ngc 5128 group by de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) , who designated it g4 because it was the fourth closest group of galaxies in his compilation .",
    "this group is primarily of interest because its brightest member is the galaxy ngc 5128 , which contains the radio source centaurus a. this object is also [ with the exception of maffei 1 ( van den bergh 1971 , huchtmeier , karachentsev & karachentsev 1999 ) ] the nearest early - type giant galaxy .",
    "de vaucouleurs recognized the galaxies ngc 4945 , 5068 , 5102 , 5128 , 5236 and 5253 as probable group members .",
    "using more recent data hesser et al .",
    "( 1984 ) assigned 20 galaxies to this group . from their data",
    "these authors derived a group mass of @xmath10 . using ( hst ) observations of the tip of the red giant branch in ngc 5128 harris ,",
    "poole & harris ( 1998 ) obtained a distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath11 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath12  mpc .",
    "this value is in good agreement with ( m - m)@xmath13 that soria et al .",
    "( 1996 ) had previously found using the same method .",
    "independent distance estimates are by hui et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who , after correction to modern local group distances , found ( m - m)@xmath14 from the luminosity function of planetary nebulae , and by tonry & schechter ( 1990 ) who obtained ( m - m)@xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath16  mpc , from surface brightness fluctuations in ngc  5128",
    ".    it would be of interest to search for cepheids among the young blue stellar populations ( van den bergh 1976a ) that are associated with the dark band of gas and dust which crosses the face of ngc  5128 .",
    "it is generally believed that the present , rather chaotic , morphology of ngc  5128 is due to the fact that this object recently merged with a spiral galaxy . the s0pec galaxy ngc  5102 in the cen a group is presently undergoing a burst of star formation , which may have been triggered by gas captured from the luminous sc spiral ngc  5253 about @xmath17 years ago ( van den bergh 1976b ) .    an independent check on the distance of the centaurus a group is provided by hst observations of cepheids in ngc 5253 ( saha et al .",
    "1995 ) , which yields ( m - m)@xmath18 , corresponding to @xmath19  mpc .",
    "in the subsequent discussion a distance of 3.9 mpc will be adopted for both ngc  5128 and for the cen a cluster . from a historical point of view it is of interest to note that this value is , within its errors , indistinguishable from the distance @xmath20  mpc adopted by de vaucouleurs ( 1975 ) .",
    "this serves to illustrate the fact that the extragalactic distance scale , out to distances of @xmath21  mpc , has remained essentially unchanged for a quarter of a century .",
    "a catalog of possible members of the centaurus group has been published by ct et al .",
    "more recently banks et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have obtained hi observations for a number of cluster suspects .",
    "table 1 gives data on 30 probable group members .",
    "following banks et al .",
    "the galaxy cen 5 , which has a heliocentric radial velocity of only @xmath22  km  s@xmath3 , has been omitted as a probable foreground object .",
    "alternatively it might be a background galaxy that is superposed on a local high - velocity cloud .",
    "also omitted is ngc  5068 , which lies 22@xmath23 north of the main concentration of centaurus a group members .",
    "data listed in the table are : ( 1 ) galaxy name , ( 2 ) alias , ( 3 ) angular distance from ngc 5128 , ( 4 ) radial velocity corrected to the centroid of the local group , assuming a solar velocity of 306  km  s@xmath3 towards @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) , and ( 5 ) the galactic hi content in units of @xmath26 from banks et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    the data plotted by banks et al .",
    "show that the centaurus group has a rather irregular structure .",
    "nevertheless , it will be assumed that this group is dynamically centered on ngc  5128 , which is its most luminous ( and presumably most massive ) member .",
    "the distribution of the angular distances of individual galaxies in the centaurus group from ngc  5128 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "taken at face value the data plotted in the figure suggest that half of the members of the centaurus group are situated within @xmath27 of ngc  5128 . at a distance of 3.9 mpc this yields r@xmath4  kpc .",
    "the true half - mass radius is expected to be smaller than this value because a significant fraction of the cluster mass is associated with the central galaxy ngc  5128 . on the other hand",
    "the incompleteness of the sample at r(ngc 5128)@xmath28 will lead to an underestimate of the true half - mass radius .",
    "it is noted in passing that the value r@xmath1  kpc for the cen a group is larger than the value r@xmath29  kpc , which courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) find for the local group .",
    "furthermore the @xmath30  kpc projected separation , between the dominant galaxies ngc  5128 and ngc  5253 , is slightly larger than the 760 kpc linear separation ( van den bergh 2000 ) of the milky way system and the andromeda galaxy .",
    "if it is assumed that the cen a cluster is in virial equilibrium , and that its velocity ellipsoid is isotropic ( @xmath31 ) , then its mass can be computed from its velocity dispersion and half - mass radius ( spitzer 1969 ) . according to binney & tremaine ( 1987 , eq .",
    "4 - 80b ) @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is in km  s@xmath3 and r@xmath0 is in kpc . from the data in table 1",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath34  km  s@xmath3 . substituting this value into eqn .",
    "( 1 ) yields a total cluster mass of @xmath35 . for comparison",
    "it is noted that courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) found a mass of only @xmath36 for the local group .",
    "reasons for this difference are that ( 1 ) the radial velocity dispersion in the local group is only @xmath37  km  s@xmath3 , and ( 2 ) the adopted half - mass radius of cen a is r@xmath38  mpc , compared to r@xmath39  mpc for the local group .    alternatively the mass of the centaurus a group may be estimated using the projected mass method of bahcall & tremaine ( 1981 ) . according to heisler , tremaine , & bahcall ( 1985 )",
    "the projected mass estimator may be expressed as @xmath40 in which n is the number of cluster galaxies and g is the gravitational constant . from the data in table 1 this yields m@xmath41 , which is in reasonable agreement with the virial mass of m@xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 mass of the cen a group is about seven times greater than the ( @xmath44 mass that courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) derived for the local group .",
    "the mean velocity of the cen a group , relative to the centroid of the local group , is @xmath45  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this value is , within its errors , indistinguishable from the @xmath46  km  s@xmath3 velocity of ngc  5128 relative to the local group .",
    "the cluster velocity of @xmath47  km  s@xmath3 , in conjunction with a distance of 3.9  mpc , yields a hubble parameter h@xmath48  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the fact that this value is so close to the numerical value of h@xmath49 , that is derived from observations of distant galaxies , suggests that the local region of the universe may be rather cold .    the radius of the zero - velocity surface , which separates the cluster from the hubble flow ( lynden - bell 1981 , sandage 1986 ) , is given by    @xmath50 = \\left ( \\frac{\\rm 8gt^2}{\\pi^2 } { \\rm m } \\right)^{1/3 }   = 0.154 ( { \\rm t[gyr]})^{2/3 } ( { \\rm m[10^{12 } m\\sun]})^{1/3}. \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath51 and t@xmath52  gyr one obtains r@xmath9  mpc , corresponding to an angular size of 35@xmath53 . the radius of the zero - velocity surface of the local group is 1.2  mpc ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "the distance to the cen a group is 3.9  mpc , and the radii of the zero - velocity surfaces of the cen a group and local group are 2.3  mpc and 1.2  mpc , respectively .",
    "the zero velocity surfaces of these two clusters therefore almost touch each other .",
    "this suggests that the early evolution of the local group may have been dynamically affected by the cen a group .",
    "de vaucouleurs et al . ( 1991 ) list luminosities and absorption values for 16 of the brightest galaxies in table 1 .",
    "for an assumed distance of 3.9  mpc these objects have a combined absolute magnitude m@xmath54 . of this luminosity 58%",
    "is contributed by ngc  5128 itself .",
    "the three brightest cluster galaxies ( ngc  945 , ngc  5128 and ngc  5256 ) together provide 89% of the total group luminosity calculated above .",
    "these data suggest that the fainter group galaxies provide only a negligible contribution to the total group luminosity .",
    "adopting m@xmath54 and m@xmath55 yields a total cluster luminosity l@xmath56 . in conjunction with a total cluster mass of @xmath43 ,",
    "this yields m / l@xmath57 in solar units . with @xmath58",
    "this is quite similar to the value m / l@xmath59  h ( in solar units ) that girardi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtain for poor nearby abel clusters .",
    "however , it is larger than the value m / l@xmath60 that courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) find for the local group .",
    "the centaurus a group is an irregular clustering centered on ngc  5128 .",
    "this group has a mass which is about seven times greater than that of the local group .",
    "it is located at a distance of @xmath61  mpc , and is found to have a mass - to- light ratio ( in solar units ) of 155200 , which is quite similar to the mass - to - light ratios found for typical poor abel clusters .",
    "the cen a group has a half - light radius of @xmath62  kpc .",
    "its zero - velocity surface ( assumed to be spherical ) has a radius r@xmath9  mpc .",
    "since this value is more than half of the distance to ngc  5128 , it appears probable that the cen a cluster may have had a significant influence on the early dynamical evolution of the local group .",
