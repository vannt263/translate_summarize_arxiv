    "electronic noise generated by the thermal excitation of charge carriers has been observed and explained by johnson and nyquist more than 80 years ago @xcite and discussed in great detail in the literature since then .",
    "more recently , it has been found that this so - called johnson - nyquist noise is the main source of dephasing in mesoscopic systems at low temperatures of a few kelvins , where phonons are frozen out .",

    "the goal of this paper is to give a transparent and systematic description of the thermal noise properties for such systems . in particular",
    ", we will derive an expression for the fluctuations of the scalar electric potentials for arbitrary geometries , eq .  , and a general expression for the corresponding dephasing rate , eq .  .",
    "throughout , we assume that a description of the noise in terms of scalar potentials is sufficient , i.e. we neglect the fluctuations of the transverse component of the electromagnetic field ( for a detailed discussion of the latter , see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "let us start by reviewing simplified arguments to derive the noise correlation function : johnson and nyquist concluded that thermal noise in electrical conductors is approximately white , meaning that the power spectral density is nearly constant throughout the whole frequency spectrum .",
    "if in addition the fluctuations are uncorrelated for different points in space , a correlation function for the random thermal currents in the classical limit is independent of frequency @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 .",

    "the factor @xmath12 coincides with the solution of a diffusion equation in an infinite system , which reflects the fact that the currents , eq .  , are uncorrelated in space .",

    "@xcite in this paper , we derive an analogy of eq .   for disordered systems with arbitrary geometry and dimensionality ; this will in particular apply to networks of disordered wires . a detailed calculation , which takes into account all properties of the mesoscopic samples , has to be done in the real - space representation .",
