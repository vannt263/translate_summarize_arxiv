    "in the lattice qcd monte carlo calculation , the spectroscopy of the ground - state hadrons in the quenched approximation has been almost established and reproduces the experimental values within 10% deviations . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectroscopy of the excited - state baryons is a current interesting subject in lattice qcd . in this study",
    ", we focus on the low - lying negative - parity baryons , especially the parity partner of the ground - state baryons and the flavor - singlet baryon , @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is a mysterious baryon in the quark model viewpoint .",
    "it is the lightest negative - parity baryon though it has strangeness .",
    "our purpose of this paper is to clarify whether a naive three valence quark picture can explain the mass of @xmath0 using the characteristics of quenched lattice qcd , and to investigate spectra of the parity partners of the ground - state baryons of the flavor octet and decuplet states@xcite .",
    "the other possible candidate for the @xmath0 state is the @xmath1 ( 5-quark ) state .",
    "it is useful to employ the quenched approximation to know whether the dominant component of @xmath0 is the three - quark state , because the overlap with the three - quark and five - quark states is absent and hence the properties of the purely three - quark state can be singled out .",
    "we employ the standard wilson gauge action and the @xmath2 improved wilson quark action with tadpole improvement .",
    "we adopt the anisotropic lattice because high resolution in the temporal direction makes us easy to follow the change of correlation of heavy baryons .",
    "we take the renormalized anisotropy as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the spatial and temporal lattice spacings , respectively .",
    "the simulation is performed on three lattices for which the parameters are well tuned and the errors are rather well evaluated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the sizes of the lattices are @xmath6 gev ) , @xmath7 gev ) and @xmath8 gev ) .",
    "the scale @xmath9 is determined from the @xmath10 meson mass .",
    "determination of the parameters is described in ref.@xcite .    on the quark mass ,",
    "we adopt four different values , which roughly cover around the strange quark mass .",
    "we use the standard baryon operator listed in table [ tab : op ] which survive in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the negative - parity baryons can be also measured by these operators using the parity projection .",
    "they are nothing but the parity partners of the ground - state baryons . in the source operator ,",

    "[ fig : spectrum4 ] . as for the negative - parity baryons ,",
    "most of the present lattice results comparatively well reproduces the experimental spectra of the lowest - lying negative - parity baryons , in spite of relatively large statistical errors .",
    "( for the light baryons such as the nucleon and the delta , it is reported that there are non - analytic terms in the chiral extrapolation of the nucleon in the quenched level , which may cause the nucleon and the delta heavier than the experimentally observed masses to some extent . )",
    "however , the lattice result of the flavor - singlet negative - parity baryon is much heavier than the experimentally observed @xmath0 .",
    "note here that the flavor - singlet baryon has one strange valence quark and therefore the ambiguity from the chiral extrapolation should be less than that of the nucleon and the delta .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy between the lattice result and experimental value of @xmath0 is the largest of all .",
    "even if we take the quenching effect of 10% level into account , this large discrepancy can not be understood .",
    "therefore , the numerical result for the flavor - singlet baryon exhibits a different feature from other channels , which indicates that it is unacceptably heavier than @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the present lattice result indicates that the three valence quark picture fails to represent the experimentally observed @xmath0 , i.e. , the overlap with the 3q component of @xmath0 is small .",
    "the other possible candidate for @xmath0 is a five - quark @xmath1 state .",
    "lattice calculations of the @xmath1 ( 5q ) state will also elucidate the nature of @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on other negative - parity baryons . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum4 ] , we see that the lattice results of the flavor octet and decuplet sectors are all close to the observed lowest - lying negative parity baryons , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , although they have a relatively large statistical error .",
    "the identification of the parity partner of the sigma baryon is interesting because the evidence of existence of @xmath21 is only fair@xcite . as for the @xmath22 baryons , although the @xmath22 with @xmath23 baryon is not known experimentally , we can identify the parity partner as @xmath24 from our results .",

    "we have studied the mass spectra of the negative - parity baryons , which are the parity partners of the ground - state ( positive - parity ) baryons , and the flavor - singlet baryons in the quenched anisotropic lattice qcd .",
    "the positive- and negative - parity baryon masses are extracted from the same baryon correlators with the parity projection .    compared with the experimental values ,",
    "our present results of the lattice calculation show that the possible assignment of the parity partners of the ground - state baryons for octet and decuplet is the lowest - lying negative - parity baryons .",
    "it is also interesting to relate our lattice data to some phenomenological models for parity doublet baryons@xcite for future .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the negative - parity flavor - singlet baryon is much heavier than that of @xmath0 , whose behavior is quite different from other negative - parity baryons .",
    "this large discrepancy between the lattice result and experimental spectrum seems to imply that the three valence quark picture fails to represent the @xmath0 state , i.e. , the overlap with the three - quark state of @xmath0 is small . for more definite understanding of @xmath0 spectrum",
    ", one needs more extensive work about the flavor - singlet baryon such as the observation of the @xmath1 ( five - quark ) state .",
    "such a study is interesting even at the quenched level , where the dynamical quark - loop effect including the quark - antiquark pair creation is absent and then the quark - level constitution of hadrons is definitely clear in the simulation .",
