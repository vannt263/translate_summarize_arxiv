    "molecular collisional excitation rate coefficients are important as they contribute to level excitation ( and quenching or deexcitation ) in competition with radiative processes . in cold environments such as",
    "the ism , the dominant collision partners are often h@xmath3 and he , except in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) and diffuse gas where collisions with electrons and",
    "h can become important .",
    "precise laboratory data including collisional ( de)-excitation rate coefficients are required , for a range of temperatures , to interpret the complicated interstellar spectra of molecular gas not in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "because of the complexity and difficulty in direct measurements , only limited state - to - state collision rate coefficients have been obtained for systems of astrophysical interest ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore modeling astrophysical systems rely heavily on theoretical estimates @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the hydrogen halide hcl , which has been detected in the atmospheres of some planets , as well as in interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "it is an important tracer of chlorine and can be used to constrain the chlorine elemental abundance and isotope ratios .",
    "@xcite observed it toward the sagittarious b2 complex and modeled its non - lte spectrum .",
    "further , hcl was recently detected in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 by _ herschel _ @xcite .",
    "it has also been surveyed throughout the interstellar medium ( ism ) via its rotational line emission by @xcite .",
    "it appears that hcl is a particularly good tracer of molecular cloud cores of the highest density ; however , the density estimates are limited by the uncertainty in collision rates .",
    "the hcl - he collision system has been investigated theoretically and experimentally in a variety of studies @xcite . the first reliable potential energy surface ( pes ) for the hcl - he complex",
    "was presented by @xcite and used to theoretically fit experimental helium pressure broadening cross sections of dcl at very low temperature and at 300 k. @xcite computed hcl - he rate coefficients for temperatures between 10 k and 300 k on the potential by @xcite , but their calculations were limited to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rotational quantum number . in their calculations , collision cross sections were computed using the molscat scattering code @xcite within the essentially exact close - coupling ( cc ) formalism . for total energies above 1200 k ,",
    "the coupled - states ( cs ) approximation was used .",
    "two newer pess for hcl - he have been reported @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( rigid monomer ) pes of @xcite was developed from ab initio calculations using symmetry - adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) with an ( @xmath6 ) basis set plus midbond functions .",
    "this sapt potential is in good agreement with the semiempirical pes of @xcite predicting that the global minimum is on the cl side .",
    "the accuracy of the sapt potential was tested by performing rovibrational bound states calculations of the hcl - he complex , which show that the calculated transition frequencies were in excellent agreement with the measurements of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the dissociation energy predicted by the sapt potential for the complex is probably more accurate than the experiment .",
    "@xcite presented another two - dimensional hcl - he potential using the coupled - cluster with single , double , and triple excitations ( ccsdt ) method .",
    "this potential is very similar to the sapt pes , but gives better agreement with the experimental dissociation energy and rotational energy levels of the hcl - he complex . very recently three - dimensional and two - dimensional pess were presented by @xcite and by @xcite , which used the supermolecular approach based on the ccsd(t ) method , but at different levels of theory .",
    "these new potentials were also used in cc calculations of pure rotational excitation of hcl by he by these authors . cross sections for transitions among the first 11 rotational states of hcl",
    "were calculated for total energy of up to 3000 @xmath2 using molscat with the log - derivative propagator of @xcite .",
    "rate coefficients were presented from 5 to 300 k.    in this work , we performed explicit quantum scattering calculations of rotational quenching of hcl by he to higher levels of rotational excitation using the sapt potential of @xcite .",
    "hcl - he rate coefficients are presented for a large range of temperature ( 0.1 - 3000 k ) which will aid in modeling rotational spectra of hcl in various astrophysical and atmospheric environments .",
    "we discuss the computational method in section 2 and the results in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "an estimate of the uncertainty in the cross sections and rate coefficients is presented , while section 5 briefly discusses application of the current results to astrophysics .",

    "the state - to - state quenching cross sections from initial levels @xmath5=5 and 15 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) , respectively .",
    "cross sections using the cs approximation begin at 2000 @xmath2 and are seen to be in excellent agreement with those obtained with the cc method .",
    "the cross sections display resonances in the intermediate energy region from @xmath350.1 @xmath2 to @xmath3510 @xmath2 due to quasibound levels supported by the attractive part of the interaction potential .",
    "the @xmath36 transition dominants the quenching for all @xmath5 ( shown here for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , with the cross sections generally increasing with increasing @xmath17 with that for @xmath39 being the smallest .",

    "[ fig2 ] displays the total deexcitation cross section for quenching from selected initial levels @xmath5=2 , 4 , 6 , @xmath40 , 18 , and 20 .",
    "generally , the total quenching cross sections have similar behavior , but differences result for small @xmath5 at high energy due to a limited number of final exit channels .",
    "each of the cross sections exhibits the behavior predicted by wigner ( 1948 ) threshold laws at ultra - low collision energies below @xmath3510@xmath41 @xmath2 , where only @xmath42-wave scattering contributes and the cross sections vary inversely with the relative velocity . except for @xmath5=2",
    "the total deexcitation cross sections decrease to a global minimum near 500 @xmath2 .",
    "the state - to - state thermal rate coefficients can be calculated by thermally averaging the appropriate state - to - state cross sections over maxwell - boltzmann distribution of kinetic energy @xmath24 . to our knowledge , there has been no published experimental rate coefficients available for rotational transitions of hcl by collisions with he .",
    "therefore , we compare our rate coefficients with the theoretical results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which were obtained over a limited temperature range of 10 to 300  k. as examples , figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show selected transitions for state - to - state deexcitation rate coefficients from initial hcl levels @xmath5=1 , 3 , and 7 .",
    "generally , our results show very good agreement with that of @xcite and @xcite , which were computed using different potentials .    for initial state @xmath43 , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows that the present rate coefficients are larger than those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the temperature range from 10 to 300 k , but their rate coefficients approach our results with increasing temperature .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , which displays state - to - state deexcitation rate coefficients from initial level @xmath44 , shows that the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite agree well with the present rate coefficients , except that for quenching to @xmath17=0 the rate coefficients of both @xcite and @xcite are larger than the present results .",
    "state - to - state rate coefficients from initial state @xmath45 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where comparison of the present results with the rate coefficients of @xcite show excellent agreement . except for the transition @xmath46",
    ", the rate coefficients of @xcite generally show good agreement with present results .",
    "these differences are likely related to differences in the adopted pess ( see below ) . for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we also present the state - to - state deexcitation rate coefficients for temperatures from 0.1 k to 3000 k for initial levels @xmath5=10 and 20 . over the whole temperatures range considered , the rate coefficients generally increase with increasing temperature for all transitions .",
    "further , one can clearly see that the rate coefficients decrease with increasing @xmath47 with the @xmath48 transitions dominant .",
    "one essential prerequisite for accurate cross section and rate coefficient calculations is the availability of a pes with high accuracy .",
    "however the quality of the pes depends not only on the methods used for the interaction energy calculation , but also the accuracy and reliability of the potential fitting and extension to long range .",
    "convergence testing was performed in our calculations by using sufficiently large basis sets and adjustment of other calculation parameters .",
    "consequently , the uncertainty associated with our cross section calculation is related primarily to the uncertainty in the adapted pes . in this work , the sapt pes of @xcite was applied . as discussed by @xcite",
    "the main features of the hcl - he pes are a minimum in the linear configuration he - h - cl , global minimum at the he - cl - h configuration , and a saddle point close to the t - shaped configuration .",
    "this also applies to pess of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the major difference between the three potentials is the well depth of the global minimum . to estimate the uncertainty of the cross sections and rate coefficients calculated from the pes of @xcite , a simple approach is to scale the sapt pes by the largest and smallest ratio of the well depths of the three pess",
    "of course , the cross section and rate coefficients depend on the detailed structure of the potential including the shape , well depth , and position of the minumum which relies heavily on the methods applied in the hcl - he potential calculaltion . here , the well depth is used to illutrate the uncertainty in scattering calculations .",
    "we calculated the deexcitation cross section and rate coefficient for the @xmath49 transition using the sapt pes scaled by factors of 1.0322 and 0.9688 , respectively , i.e. , a variation of @xmath50 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the @xmath49 quenching cross sections and rate coefficients obtained using the scaled sapt potential with the results obtained from the original sapt potential . due to differences in the pes well - depths , it can be seen that the cross sections and rate coefficients show evident disagreement at low collision energy and low temperature , @xmath51 k. in the van der waals interaction - dominated regime , the rate coefficients exhibit an oscillatory temperature dependence due to the presence of resonances .",
    "the magnitudes , widths , and positions of the resonances are sensitive to the details of the pes .",
    "however for high collision energy and high temperature , the cross sections and rate coefficients from the scaled and original sapt pes generally converge . in another words ,",
    "the uncertainty due to the accuracy of the sapt pes is negligible at high temperatures .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the computed rate coefficients to be 12% , 4% , and 1.3% at 1 , 10 , and 100 k , respectively .",
    "rate coefficients for collisional excitation and deexcitation are of importance in describing the dynamics of energy transfer processes in interstellar objects .",
    "in particular , accurate rotational and vibrational excitation rates are needed to interpret microwave and infrared observations of the interstellar gas for non - lte line formation .",
    "further , the thermal balance of interstellar gas is partly determined by cooling processes involving molecular collisional excitation followed by radiative decay . despite some progress in laboratory measurements of state - to - state collisional rate coefficients and",
    "cross sections , astrophysical models depend almost exclusively on theoretical data .",
    "experiments do provide , when available , some confidence in the theoretical rate coefficients .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", hcl has been observed in emission and absorption in a variety of astronomical environments .",
    "agndez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported observations of the @xmath5=1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , and 3 - 2 rotational lines of h@xmath52cl and h@xmath53cl in the carbon star envelope irc+10216 using the _ herschel_/hifi instrument .",
    "it was inferred that hcl is produced in the inner layers of the envelope close to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",

    "therefore , the current rate coefficient calculations , which extend from 0.1 to 3000  k , are the most comprehensive to date for he and can be utilized in a variety of applications augmenting the datasets developed for he , h@xmath3 and electrons ( see also , the lamda website , * ? ? ?",
    "the rate coefficients for molecular scattering with para - h@xmath3 are often estimated using available rate coefficients with he by the application of a constant reduced - mass scaling factor of 1.4 @xcite . however , @xcite calculated the rate coefficients for sis scattering with para - h@xmath3 and compared their results to the sis - he rate coefficients @xcite scaled by the h@xmath3/he reduced - mass factor and found significant differences . in",

    "applying such a procedure to the current hcl - he rates coefficients to estimate rate coefficients for h@xmath3 is therefore not recommended .",
