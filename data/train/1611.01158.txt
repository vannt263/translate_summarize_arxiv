    "we discuss a possible explanation for this x - ray emission in section 6 .",
    "we have assembled an sed from existing ubvi photometry @xcite , the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , wide field infrared explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) , and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; @xcite ) .",

    "we first fit a model of the primary to the 2mass and wise data .",
    "these ir measurements should be dominated by the flux from the primary , whereas the optical and uv flux may be contaminated by flux from a ms secondary .",
    "we model the primary with a 4500 - 5500 k giant spectrum @xcite in steps of 50 k in order to bracket the the apogee @xmath32 of @xmath48 k. we use a grid of radii between 8.0 - 10.0 r@xmath1  in 0.1 r@xmath1  increments .",
    "we fix the surface gravity to log g= 3.0 from asteroseismic scaling ( table 1 ) .",
    "we use distances of either 800 , 850 , or 900 pc based on the range given in the literature @xcite .",
    "we adopt e(b - v)= 0.041 @xcite and the extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "the best - fit sed temperature and radius only fall within the 3@xmath49 errors on the apogee temperature and the asteroseismic radius if we use a distance of 900 pc . using 900 pc ,",
    "we find a best - fit of 8.8 r@xmath1and 4900 k ( see figure 2b ) .",
    "using this model for our primary , we find a significant flux excess over the model in all of the bluer bands ( fuv , nuv , u , b , v ) indicating the presence of a secondary ( see figure 2a ) . fixing the primary to these best - fit values ,",
    "we model the secondary using a fixed surface gravity of log g= 4.5 ( typical for a ms star ) , a grid of temperatures between 5000 - 8000 k in steps of 250 k , and secondary radii between 0.5 r@xmath1 - 2.0 r@xmath1  in steps of 0.1 r@xmath1 .",
    "we find that a variety of secondary models result in @xmath47 values near the minimum with temperatures of 6250 - 8000 k and radii of 0.5 - 1.8 r@xmath1 , but if we restrict the radius to fall between the zams radius and the radius at 4 gyr for a given temperature , we find the best fit to be a @xmath46250 - 6750 k , 1.2 - 1.6 r@xmath1  star ( figure 2c , d ) .",
    "this range includes both stars on the upper main - sequence in m67 , as well as blue straggler stars near the msto . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the star is on the upper ms when considering formation scenarios , but the possibility that the secondary is a blue straggler is worth follow up , i.e. with higher resolution spectra that could detect the secondary .",
    "we note there is a galex fuv excess in the sed ( figure 2c ) , but we do not consider this excess to be meaningful .",
    "castelli - kurucz models have poor resolution in the fuv , and a few unresolved emission lines can change the flux substantially .",
    "in fact , ms stars near the turn off in m67 have widely varying galex fuv fluxes , and several are observed to have comparable fuv magnitudes .",
    "in figure  [ cmd ] we decompose the light of the binary to show the location of the primary and the secondary in a cmd .",
    "we show two possible deconvolutions : an ms secondary and a bss secondary .",
    "the secondary is fixed to either a 6750 k bss ( red circle ) , or a 6250 k ms star near the turnoff ( orange circle ) .",
    "the primary is a @xmath50 k giant .",
    "we compare the cmd position of the primary and secondary to evolutionary tracks using modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the test suite case ` 1m_pre_ms_to_wd ` changing only the mass and turning off rgb and agb wind mass loss .",
    "the cmd location of the primary is fainter than expected from mesa models for a giant with a mass and radius within @xmath51 of the asteroseismic measurements . to bring the photometry and asteroseismology into agreement requires using a distance at the highest range of those determined in the literature for m67 ( 900 pc ) , and a primary mass and radius of @xmath52 m@xmath1  and @xmath53 r@xmath1 , more than @xmath3 below the asteroseismic values . the bss and msto secondary fall on evolutionary tracks for a @xmath54 and @xmath55 m@xmath1  star , respectively .",
    "while using a distance of 900 pc to m67 creates the best agreement between the asteroseismic mass and the photometry for s1237 , @xcite find an asteroseismic distance to m67 of @xmath56 pc based on the entire sample of red giants in m67 . using 816 pc results in a photometric mass and radius for the primary more than @xmath57 below the asteroseismic values .",
    "depending on the distance used , the asteroseismic results may be @xmath58 and @xmath59 higher than the photometric mass and radius , respectively .",
    "some recent studies comparing _ kepler _ masses and radii from uncorrected asteroseismic scaling relations and rgb eclipsing binaries have found systematic differences between the two measurements ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) similar to the size of the discrepancy we find .",
    "we have used corrected scaling relations , which should provide better agreement @xcite , and @xcite find that the average rgb mass in m67 from corrected scaling relations is consistent with eclipsing binary results for the cluster .",
    "however , the scaling relations have not been well validated by independent measurements ( e.g. comparison to eclipsing binaries or cluster isochrones ) for heb stars at masses as large as 2.9 m@xmath1 , and it is therefore possible that the corrections that work for lower mass stars can not be extrapolated to stars of such high mass .",
    "this uncertainty is not reflected in our errors .",
    "we encourage more tests of the scaling relations for massive heb stars to shed light on this possible discrepancy .",
    "alternatively , s1237 may be following a non - standard evolutionary track due to past mass transfer , a merger , or a stellar collision .",
    "however , models of the evolution of mass - transfer products predict they return to close - to - normal evolution soon after mass transfer has ceased @xcite",
    ". models of stellar collision products are bluer and brighter than standard evolutionary tracks due to enhanced mixing enriching the star in helium , although this difference is minor on the giant branch @xcite .",
    "our results indicate the opposite : the star is less luminous and redder than expected given its asteroseismic mass .",
    "apogee c , n , and fe abundances do not appear unusual , but a more careful abundance analysis may prove interesting .",
    "using mesa we estimate the primary s age to be 450 myr if it is a 2.9 m@xmath1  heb star .",
    "this is likely an overestimate , as it assumes the primary begins with a core that has not burned through any hydrogen . in reality , this star likely formed by adding material to a lower mass ms star to create a bss .",
    "the ms progenitor would already have gone through @xmath43.5 gyr of evolution , perhaps resulting in a core substantially depleted of hydrogen .",
    "this translates to a shorter lifetime for the star once it becomes a bss .",
    "if we consider a 2.4 m@xmath1  star , @xmath42 @xmath49 lower than the asteroseismic value but consistent with the mass implied from its cmd position , the lifetime is @xmath4750 myr .",
    "this longer lifetime would result in a more massive msto at the time of formation , and the lower mass makes it more plausible that the star formed from mass transfer or a merger .",
    "we discuss this in greater detail in the following sections .",
    "the m67 msto is 1.3 m@xmath1(@xmath60 m@xmath1 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and would have been only slightly more massive 450 myr ago .",
    "mass transfer between two such stars would not create a star within the @xmath51 uncertainty on the mass of s1237 ( @xmath61 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "if we consider a @xmath62 m@xmath1  primary the star could have formed from two 1.4  m@xmath1  stars ( the turnoff mass 750 myr ago ) and a mass transfer origin is worth considering .",
    "the result of mass transfer from an agb star would be a blue / yellow straggler - wd binary , and thus some mass would be locked up in a wd companion . given the typical carbon - oxygen wd mass of 0.5 - 0.6 m@xmath1 , we would expect a primary with @xmath63 m@xmath1 , even under the unrealistic assumption of totally conservative mass transfer .",
    "a lower mass helium wd is not possible because the orbital period of 698 days is too wide to be the result of rgb mass transfer @xcite .",
    "additionally , the sed shows no clear evidence of a hot wd companion , though an older ( @xmath64 myr ) , cool wd would be compatible with the fuv photometry .",
    "the system requires a ms companion to explain the sed , so including a wd would require the system to be a triple , e.g. a giant- wd binary with a wide msto tertiary .",
    "the orbital solution and residuals show no indication of perturbation by such a third body .    mass transfer leading to a merger between two ms stars could create a @xmath65  m@xmath1  star without a wd remnant .",
    "such mergers may happen when magnetic braking shrinks the orbit of a close binary , but ms mergers may also result from angular momentum loss during a dynamical encounter or kozai - cycle oscillations ( see sections [ dynamical ] and [ kozai ] ) .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at least three turnoff mass stars are needed to make a 2.9 m@xmath1  primary , and another is required for the secondary . a binary - binary , single - triple , binary - triple , or triple - triple encounter could provide the four stars needed to create s1237 . if we consider a 2.4 m@xmath1  primary it is possible to form the primary from just 2 stars , making a single - binary encounter viable .",
    "@xcite present a method to estimate bss production rates from stellar collisions .",
    "we use their equations and parameters for m67 to calculate encounter rates and present them in table  [ rates ] .",
    "we also list the poisson probability ( @xmath66 ) that at least one encounter of each type would have occurred within the lifetime of s1237 , calculated using :    @xmath67    here @xmath68 is the lifetime from section 5.1 , and @xmath69 is the encounter rate .",
    "these rates suggest a few encounters can have occurred within the lifetime of s1237 , so @xcite indicate a collisional origin is possible .",
    "we note that post - encounter binaries most commonly have higher predicted eccentricities than s1237 @xcite .",
    "theory predicts s1237 should not have tidally circularized @xcite , so if s1237 was collisionally formed the low eccentricity is unusual .",
    "one collision is sufficient to create a @xmath70 m@xmath1  primary , but to create a 2.9  m@xmath1  primary requires at least 2 collisions to occur during the encounter .",
    "scattering experiments show that binary - binary encounters have significant probability ( @xmath71 ) of producing two or more collisions due to the increased cross - section for interaction after the adiabatic expansion of the initial collision product @xcite .",
    "alternatively , s1237 could have undergone multiple collisional encounters .",
    "n - body simulations of m67 have produced multiple ` super - bsss ' with masses more than twice the turnoff mass after back - to - back dynamical encounters @xcite . while the rates suggest such massive bsss should be rare , we know they are produced in open clusters .",
    "in addition to s1237 , m67 hosts bsss s977",
    "f81 ) and s1082 @xcite .",
    "s977 has a cmd location indicative of a star more than twice the turnoff mass , and s1082 is a triple bss system with a combined dynamically - measured mass of @xmath72  m@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "multiple collisions seems to be the most plausible mechanism to create these massive systems .",
    "studies @xcite have proposed that kozai - cycle - induced mergers of an inner binary in a hierarchical triple may form bsss .",
    "@xcite run a large set of monte carlo models to determine the effect of kozai cycles on the final orbital configuration of hierarchical triples .",
    "they find the triples that lead to inner binary mergers resemble s1237 in several ways .",
    "first , they find that mergers most often originate in triples with outer orbital periods ( @xmath73 ) of @xmath74 days , consistent with the 698-day period of s1237 .",
    "second , they find a peak in the mass ratio ( @xmath75 ) between the tertiary and inner binary of 0.4 - 0.5 . assuming @xmath76",
    "m@xmath1  and @xmath77 m@xmath1 , s1237 has a ratio of 0.45 .",
    "third , merged systems with @xmath78 days have a fairly flat eccentricity distribution from 0.0 to 0.5 @xcite , consistent with the low orbital eccentricity of s1237 ( e= 0.087 ) .",
    "the vast majority of these systems merge in less than 10 myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , if s1237 was a primordial triple we would expect it to have undergone a kozai induced merger and evolved to a stellar remnant long ago .",
    "however , an initially stable primordial triple may be perturbed by a passing star leading to later - in - life kozai oscillations .",
    "alternatively , a hierarchical triple could have formed dynamically a few hundred myr ago , and quickly undergone a kozai induced merger to create s1237 . in either scenario ,",
    "the maximum mass for the merger product would be twice the turnoff mass , or @xmath79 m@xmath1 , just outside the @xmath51 error on the asteroseismic mass . to produce",
    "a 2.9 m@xmath1  star would require that one of the stars in the inner binary was already a bss .",
    "we present asteroseismic measurements of a binary yss in m67 from _ kepler _ k2 data . using @xmath80-corrected scaling relations , we find the primary star is a 2.9 m@xmath1 , 9.2 r@xmath1 , helium - burning star .",
    "this is more than twice the mass of the msto .",
    "sed fitting determines the secondary is near the msto , either a normal ms star or a bss .",
    "the sed and stellar models are only marginally consistent with asteroseismology , requiring a primary mass and radius 2 - 3 @xmath49 lower than the asteroseismic measurements .",
    "this suggests that s1237 is either redder and less luminous than a standard for its mass , or the asteroseismic mass and radius are too large by at least @xmath81 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "we encourage testing the asteroseismic scaling relations for massive helium burning stars for possible discrepancies .    observed x - ray emission from this star",
    "has not been explained .",
    "given the masses of the primary and secondary @xmath82= 2.9 m@xmath1 , @xmath83=1.3 m@xmath1 ) , the mass function indicates the orbit is inclined at @xmath84 .",
    "if the spin and orbital axes are aligned , the giant primary may be rapidly rotating without observable line broadening or seismic frequency splitting @xcite , thereby explaining the x - rays . alternatively",
    "the x - ray emission may arise from a rapidly rotating secondary .",
    "many x - ray sources in m67 with similar x - ray luminosities are rapid rotators located near the msto ( see fig .  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "most are tidally synchronized close binaries , which is not the case for s1237 , but rapid rotation is also expected after a recent stellar collision or mass transfer event .",
    "we review possible formation models and suggest that a binary encounter leading to one or more collisions or mergers is a possible formation pathway .",
    "collisions may have taken place during the dynamical encounter itself , or perhaps a kozai - induced merger of an inner binary in a dynamically formed triple occurred shortly afterward .",
    "this is the first asteroseismic mass measurement for a yss and the second yss for which a formation pathway has been suggested .",
    "s1040 , another yss in m67 , has a helium wd companion , suggesting it formed through mass transfer @xcite .",
