    "although quantum field theory has a long history and there are a number of different approaches to it , feynman diagrams are still the main source of its dynamical information . the necessity to know more exactly about the characteristics of specific physical processes and corresponding quantum - field - theoretic functions themselves stimulates the calculation of radiative corrections of ever higher order .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to calculate a class of three - loop diagrams shown in figs .  1 to 4 in a dimensional regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "most of the diagrams carry two kinds of propagator lines : a - type lines and b - type lines .",
    "the mass parameter of the b - type line is one - third as large as that of the a - type line .",

    "<S> using the method of chetyrkin , misiak , and mnz we calculate analytically a class of three - loop vacuum diagrams with two different mass values , one of which is one - third as large as the other . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this specific mass ratio is of great interest in relation to the three - loop effective potential of the @xmath0 @xmath1 theory . </S>",
    "<S> all pole terms in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the space - time dimensions in a dimensional regularization scheme ) plus finite terms containing the logarithm of mass are kept in our calculation of each diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that three - loop effective potential calculated using three - loop integrals obtained in this paper agrees , in the large-@xmath4 limit , with the overlap part of leading - order ( in the large-@xmath4 limit ) calculation of coleman , jackiw , and politzer [ phys . </S>",
