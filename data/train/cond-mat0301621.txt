    "many important features of spin glass models at mean field level have come out by studying their relaxional langevin dynamics from a random initial condition@xcite .",
    "the structure of the dynamical equations for the correlation and response functions has reaveled some analogies with other types of complex systems in which the disorder is apriori absent : at equilibrium the dynamics becomes formally identical to the mode coupling theory ( mct ) , which is the main approach to the supercooled liquids near the glass structural transition @xcite .",
    "thus there have been strong feelings that the two types of systems are deeply connected ; in the glasses an effective disorder is self - induced by the slow dynamics of the microscopical variables @xcite .    for spin glass systems ,",
    "the dynamical equations have been studied also in the low temperature phase @xcite .",
    "these works provide a suggestion to extend the mct below the glass temperature @xcite .",
    "one of the main result has been that for these temperatures the system never reaches the equilibrium , but rather displays an off - equilibrium behaviour where the dynamics depends on the whole history of the system up to the beginning of its observation and is characterized by the loss of validity of typical equilibrium properties , as the time traslational invariance ( tti ) and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "one can thus establish contact with some nonequilibrium experimental observations , namely the slow relaxations and the aging phenomena which are observed for real spin glasses and many other complex systems @xcite .    despite the cited resemblance , spin glasses are microscopically quite different from liquids and thus not suitable to their description .",
    "recently , to make stronger connections with liquids , some models have been introduced which combine features of spin glasses and lattice gas .",
    "being constituted of particles , they allow to introduce the density and other related quantities which are usually important in the study of liquids . in this",
    "regard we consider the frustrated blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model @xcite , which is a quite general framework to describe different glassy systems .",
    "its mean field hamiltonian is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the chemical potential and @xmath5 are quenched gaussian interactions having zero mean and variance @xmath6 _ j=1/n$ ] @xcite .",
    "essentially the model consists of a lattice gas in a frustrated medium where the particles have an internal degree of freedom , given by their spin , which may account , as an example , of the possible orientations of complex molecules in glass forming systems .",
    "these steric effects are indeed greatly responsible for the geometric frustration appearing in glass forming systems at low temperatures or high densities .",
    "besides that , the particles interact through a potential depending on the coupling @xmath7 . in particular for @xmath8",
    "one recovers the ghatak - sherrington model @xcite and for @xmath9 the ising frustrated lattice gas model @xcite ; this last case is related to the problem of the site frustrated percolation @xcite and has been also used in the presence of gravity to describe granular materials @xcite . however , as found by standard replica theory @xcite , the model does not display substantial differences by varying @xmath7 .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane @xmath10 shows a critical line separating a spin glass phase from a disordered one ; the transition is continuous for large @xmath4 , as for the standard ising spin glass ( @xmath11 ) , up to a given value @xmath12 below which becomes discontinuous ; in this region the parisi solution has been obtained only recently in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note that a dynamical treatment of the model is still lacking .",
    "we propose a spherical version of the frustrated beg model which allows a complete analysis of its equilibrium properties and even of langevin dynamics . in this paper",
    "we study this model for @xmath8 leaving the general case to future investigations @xcite .",
    "we find an equilibrium transition to a spin glass phase for @xmath13 , which is always continuous , like in the spherical sk model @xcite , except for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . furthermore , we investigate the langevin dynamics of the various two - time functions and of density in the whole phase diagram .",
    "we get exact expressions of these quantities that are in general rather complex ; they depend on several characteristic time scales whose number changes in the various regions of the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , the largest of these times is found to represent the charactristic equilibration time of the system , @xmath16 . in the nonglassy phase this is finite and for waiting times @xmath17 the two - time functions obey tti and fdt .",
    "this is no more true for @xmath18 , the system being still out of equilibrium . by studying this regime near the critical line where @xmath16 is large ,",
    "we find two different behaviours of the systems for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we give here a first qualitative description of them . in the case @xmath19",
    "fdt still holds for @xmath21 , so that deviations from the equilibrium case occur only for very small values of the correlation .",
    "instead , as @xmath4 is close to @xmath22 , the range of correlation values in the fdt regime decreases and for @xmath23 this vanishes ; if @xmath24 are sufficiently lower than @xmath25 the correlation function scales as a power of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in this region the observation of the system over short time scales could wrongly lead to conclude that the system is in the glassy phase .",
    "then , for a large but finite @xmath16 , the model follows the pattern of interrupted aging .",
    "finally , @xmath16 diverges in the whole glassy phase and the system displays essentially the same nonequilibrium behaviour of the spherical sk model @xcite .",
