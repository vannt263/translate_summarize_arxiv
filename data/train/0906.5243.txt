    "the refinement of asteroseismological models requires increased numbers of statistically reliable pulsational periodicities for observed stars .",
    "recent advances in the detailed modelling of beta cephei stars ( for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have added urgency to the need for accurate and complete identification of pulsation modes in _ real _ stars .",
    "this requires quantified significances for peaks identified in periodograms .",
    "@xcite recently reviewed some statistical significance tests that are in common use in periodogram analysis , and have assessed and compared their reliability . in their paper , they recommend implementing monte carlo methods to establish the significances of periodogram peaks , arguing that these are more reliable than the methods in common use . accordingly , we have calculated the lomb - scargle periodograms , suitably normalised by the variance of the data ( as advised by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for observations of the four beta cephei stars v400 car , v401 car , v403 car and v405 car , and have applied monte carlo methods in the way proposed by @xcite to assign significances to peaks identified in each periodogram analysis .",
    "this involved the construction of cumulative distribution functions ( cdf s ) for pseudo - gaussian noise generated on the observation time - grid of each of the respective real data sets .",
    "these cdf s were then used to determine quantitatively the significances of candidate peaks in their respective periodograms .",
    "the results of these analyses are described in the sections that follow .",
    "we report a number of newly discovered periodicities that lie above the 3 sigma level ( a significance of 99.7% ) in each of these stars .",
    "our analysis determines that there are seven periodicities above the 3-sigma level that lie within the expected range for pulsation modes in v400 car , eight in v401 car , four in v403 car , and four in v405 car .",
    "the methods applied in this paper provide an objective assessment of the identified periodicities .    a canonical value of 4:1 for the signal - to - noise ratio in a fourier amplitude spectrum ( see * ?",
    "* ) has long been applied as a threshold for accepting that a detected periodicity may be attributed to a variation in the stellar magnitude itself .",
    "@xcite showed that this 4:1 ratio corresponds to a significance of approximately 99.9% as determined from monte carlo trials .",
    "the detections claimed in this paper therefore correspond very closely to the generally accepted threshold for period detection in pulsating stars .",
    "the data set consists of 533 observations of v400 car ( star no . 11 in the designation of @xcite and @xcite for stars in ngc3293 ) in the johnson b band , obtained with the 1.0 m telescope at the sutherland station of the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) during a total timespan of 68 days in 1984 .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram of these data , normalised by the variance of the data , is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "two theoretical distribution functions were re - fitted to the tail of the empirical cdf shown in the enlargement .",
    "these are the exponential distribution function and the incomplete beta function ( called simply the beta function in the remainder of this paper ) . a detailed discussion of this refitting procedure and of these theoretical distribution functions is given in @xcite .",
    "both theoretical distributions fit the empirical cdf s reasonably well in this region , though not to the same degree . for v400 car and for v401 car , the peak significances estimated from the empirical cdf",
    "s were slightly lower ( i.e. the false alarm probabilities were higher ) than those obtained from the best - fitting theoretical distribution functions .",
    "for v403 car and for v405 car , the peak significances estimated from the empirical cdf s lie mostly between those obtained from the best - fits of the two respective theoretical distribution functions .",
    "comparisons of the respective estimates of significance obtained from the empirical cdf s and from the theoretical distribution functions are displayed in tables [ table1 ] , [ table3 ] , [ table5 ] , and [ table7 ] .",
    "for all four stars , the peak significances obtained from the best - fitting exponential distribution function are lower than those obtained from the beta function . in each of these four cases",
    ", therefore , the best - fitting exponential function provides the most conservative estimate of significance for the detected periodicities , and this is the estimate that we used in the tables that follow . in figure [ figure3 ] ,",
    "the horizontal solid lines indicate false alarm probabilities of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ( i.e. peak significances of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively ) .",
    "the periodogram peak values ( i.e. normalised power levels ) associated with these significances are read off the abscissae where the best - fit exponential function crosses the respective horizontal solid lines .",
    "the power levels corresponding to the aforementioned three significance thresholds , for the empirical cdf as well as for both of the theoretical distribution functions , are displayed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the periodograms shown in figures [ figure1 ] , [ figure6 ] , [ figure10 ] and [ figure14 ] all appear to display a rising background noise level below frequencies of about 20 radians per day .",
    "this may seem to imply that our data contains what is traditionally described as  red noise \" .",
    "however , after removal of all significant low frequency components in the prewhitening procedure , the periodograms display a behaviour that is more typical of  white noise \" ( not shown above ) .",
    "we take this to be an indication that the apparent redness of the original data is an artefact of the presence of a few strong low frequency components rather than a dense noise spectrum , and that the correct noise model to use in the corresponding monte carlo simulations is that of white rather than red noise . in any event ,",
    "our principal interest is in potential pulsation modes , and the data clearly display  flat \" noise levels in the frequency ranges predicted for low - order p - modes .",
    "thus the significances listed in tables [ table2 ] , [ table4 ] , [ table6 ] and [ table8 ] ( at least for the p - modes ) are very unlikely to be far off the values that would be obtained with a more refined noise model for the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we conclude by stating that our data allow a 3-sigma detection of seven probable pulsation modes in v400 car , another eight in v401 car , four modes in v403 car and four modes in v405 car .",
    "one of these modes , @xmath6 in v401 car , is associated with a frequency value that lies in the expected range of eigenfrequencies of low - order g - modes .",
    "this corresponds with suggestions made by @xcite and with the results of model calculations by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "further low - amplitude modes in these stars might well remain to be discovered amongst the noise levels present in our data .",
    "the open cluster ngc3293 continues to present itself as a rich source of data with which models of beta cephei pulsation may be tested",
    ". continued , intensive observation of the beta cephei stars in this cluster appears imperative ."
