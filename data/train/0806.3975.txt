    "in the conventional picture , giant planets form via a two - stage process , known as core - accretion .",
    "in such a model , first a massive rocky core is assembled via gravitational accumulation of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk and then the core begins to accrete the surrounding gas once it has grown massive enough @xcite .",
    "the growing planet excites density waves as it moves through the disk . such waves exert a torque on the planet @xcite whose net effect is to extract angular momentum from its orbit for standard protosolar nebula models @xcite .",
    "different regimes of migration have been identified by numerous studies depending on the planet s mass and on the importance of co - rotation torques ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in particular , when the planet has a mass comparable to saturn or larger the interaction with the disk becomes markedly nonlinear ( type ii migration ) and the planet carves a gap in the disk as a result of the planetary tide @xcite .",
    "then , the planet decouples dynamically from the disk and migrates inward at a pace determined by the local viscous timescale @xcite .",
    "a major assumption of almost all simulations published so far is that the disk is locally isothermal .",
    "this means that any heating is immediately radiated away , which would only be true if the disk was optically thin .",
    "the planet moves supersonically in the disk , shock - heating the gas , and gas accretion onto the planet generates compressional heating . with typical densities @xmath2g/@xmath3 ,",
    "the midplane of a minimum solar nebula disk is indeed optically thick ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , paardekooper & mellema ( 2006 , 2008 , hereafter @xcite ) have used both 2d and 3d adaptive mesh refinement simulations with radiative transfer modeled via flux - limited diffusion finding that for low mass planets both inward migration and gas accretion can be strongly suppressed .",
    "klahr & kley ( 2006 , hereafter @xcite ) studied jupiter - sized planets with a static 3d grid code and flux - limited diffusion .",
    "they did not report significant differences on migration compared with the isothermal case but found the structural evolution of the circumplanetary gas distribution to be strongly affected by radiation physics as noticed earlier in the 2d nested - grid calculations by @xcite .    yet",
    ", even these recent simulations lack several important ingredients .",
    "first , they do not treat self - consistently the dynamics of the disk , planet and star ; the planet and the star can not move , and in some cases a gap is introduced already at the beginning of the simulation ( kk06 ) .",
    "second , except for the 2d simulations of dangelo et al . ( 2003 ) , they adopt inviscid disks .",
    "recently , edgar ( 2007 ) found that giant planet migration in an isothermal viscous disk does not obey the standard type ii regime .",
    "a deep gap is never produced and hence migration does not proceed on the viscous timescale . finally , all these simulations neglect the self - gravity of the gas , which is required when simulating freely moving planets and might affect disk torques ( baruteau & masset 2008 ) .",
    "self - gravity has been previously included only in a few isothermal calculations @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present the first high - resolution three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a massive , jupiter - sized planet and a surrounding viscous protoplanetary disk that include simultaneously radiative transfer , shock heating , self - gravity of the gas and fully self - consistent dynamics .",
    "we study migration , mass flow towards the planet and the circumplanetary gas distribution , exploring also the implications on the formation of satellites of giant planets .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained for locally isothermal disks as well as other simulations with simplified disk thermodynamics .",

    "for the first few tens of orbits , when the gap is barely opened , the planet excites strong spiral modes since it is still well coupled with the disk and the migration rate is much faster than in the late stage ( see partial migration rate in table  1 ) .",
    "self - gravity also should lead to an acceleration of migration before the planet has opened a gap ( baruteau & masset 2008 ) . the mean migration rate increases with increasing disk mass ( table  1 ) , in agreement with edgar ( 2007 ) , who also studied viscous isothermal disks that do not open deep gaps .    in flux - limited diffusion ( fld )",
    "runs the planet has a significant effect on the temperature structure of the disk around it .",
    "the triggered spiral arms are associated with a shock since the planet is moving supersonically .",
    "the temperature along the spiral arms thus rises significantly because the disk midplane is optically thick ( figure  1 ) an effect which is obviously absent in isothermal runs .",
    "flux - limited diffusion runs are followed up to a point when they are still in the weak gap regime , i.e. for no more than 30 orbits .",
    "the gap is somewhat weaker in these runs because the disk is heated by the spiral shocks in the region around the planet , becoming thicker and thus making it harder to satisfy the gap opening condition .    despite the shallower gap , in fld",
    "runs migration is slower than in the isothermal case , by @xmath0 for the case of the low disk mass , and by nearly @xmath38 for the case of the low mass disk ( figure  2 , left panel and table  1 ) .",
    "the slower migration is due to an effect already seen and explained in @xcite for deeply embedded , low - mass planets .",
    "it is due to the change of the balance between the outer and inner torque acting on the planet as the thermodynamics is varied .",
    "in particular , we find that , the net torque is more negative in the isothermal runs relative to the fld ones ( figure  [ fig : migrtorque ] , right panel ) .",
    "the variation of torque balance is due to a variation in the structure of the spiral perturbations excited by the planet .",
    "torques are even more affected by the different temperature and density evolution in the adiabatic runs ( figure  2 , left panel ) . in these",
    "runs the gas along the spiral shocks rises its temperature by up to a factor of 5 and adiabatically expands away from the midplane . as a result , after 50 orbits the gas surface density in the disk midplane around the planet has decreased by a factor @xmath39 in the run with @xmath40 and by @xmath41 in the run with @xmath42 . because of the decreased gas surface density , the spiral arms around the planet weaken considerably with time , and so do the torques exerted by them",
    "then , after a few tens of orbits , migration nearly shuts off ( figure  2 , right panel ) .",
    "the planet is never able to open a gap because the radius of the planet s roche lobe is smaller than the local disk semi - thickness .      since we do not include explicitly accretion onto the planet in our simulations we calculate an hypothetical accretion rate by measuring the mass of gas that accumulates within the hill radius of the planet ( @xmath43 au ) as a function of time .",
    "the accretion rate thus defined is found to be strongly dependent on disk thermodynamics as well as on the disk mass , and , not surprisingly , increases moderately as the gravitational softening of the planet is decreased ( see table  1 ) .    in isothermal m1 runs the accretion rate averaged over nearly 200 orbits is @xmath44 m@xmath45 yr@xmath46 . in agreement with previous estimates obtained for similar disk masses and",
    "effective @xmath37 viscosities ( e.g. bate et al . 2003 ; dangelo et al .",
    "@xcite compute mass accretion rates about 3 times smaller for planets in an isothermal disk but their disk is inviscid and they start with a gap , both differences going in the direction of lowering somewhat the mass accretion . as seen in @xcite for the case of low mass planets , planetary accretion in non - isothermal disks",
    "can be reduced compared to isothermal disks .",
    "this is because the gas is compressionally heated as it flows towards the planet , and the resulting pressure gradient opposes further gas inflow .",
    "the temperature structure around the planet in one of the fld runs is shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] . for our lowest disk mass ( m1 )",
    "the accretion rate over the first 20 orbits is @xmath47 m@xmath45 yr@xmath46 in the fld run , 20 times lower than for the isothermal during the same part of the orbital evolution ( table  1 ) , and comparable with what @xcite find for their radiative transfer runs starting with or without a gap .",
    "similar rates were also obtained by dangelo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for their radiative viscous models .",
    "the difference between isothermal and fld runs is smaller in the case of the largest disk mass ( m2 ) . in the fld",
    "runs with in the m2 disk , which have the smallest softening , the planet should be able to accrete a few jupiter masses over @xmath48 years , a time comparable to the migration rate",
    ". in adiabatic disks accretion , like migration , essentially shuts off after a few tens of orbits ( table  1 ) . due to the absence of cooling compressional heating in this case",
    "is indeed more effective .",
    "moreover , heating due to spiral shocks raises the temperature of the gas even at some distance from the planet , which further stifles accretion .",
    "a circumplanetary disk begins to form already during the first few orbits in both the isothermal and the radiative transfer runs ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the disk is thicker in the radiative transfer runs due to higher thermal pressure .",
    "it is sub - keplerian in both cases . yet",
    ", there is a fairly extended region , between @xmath49 and @xmath50  au from the planet , within which the gas azimuthal velocity is close to @xmath51 of the local keplerian velocity ( figure  4 , left panel ) . in the adiabatic",
    "runs the gas becomes hot enough to form a diffuse pressure supported atmosphere around the planet rather than a dense circumplanetary disk . in the latter case",
    "the gas is markedly sub - keplerian ( figure  4 , left panel ) . in reality this is an extreme configuration that could occur only if cooling is completely suppressed by some stronger heating mechanism .",
    "a protoplanetary disk strongly irradiated by neighboring ob stars in a dense cluster might present such extreme conditions at large radii , @xmath52 au .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the velocity , density and temperature of the gas flow in the circumplanetary disk can determine whether rocky satellites of giant planets may form or not .",
    "based on the strong sub - keplerianity of the gas around their jupiter - mass planet , @xcite concluded that satellites could not form in their radiative transfer simulations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sopt ] , right panel , we show the particle size for which @xmath53=1/(2 @xmath54 ) where @xmath55 is the stopping time in the epstein regime and @xmath56 is local the orbital time . for any location in the circumplanetary disk grains whose size obeys the latter relation",
    "are the fastest to migrate towards pressure maxima ( i.e. towards the planet in this case given that pressure decreases monotonically from the planet outwards ) .",
    "much smaller particles will be entrained with the gas and migrate slowlier to the planet , while much larger boulders will follow perturbed keplerian orbits around the planet @xcite . for isothermal and",
    "fld runs the fastest migrating grains have sizes in the range 0.2 to 0.8  m , and the stopping time is almost the same in both cases .",
    "we note that our calculation is strictly valid only down to @xmath49 au from the planet ; at smaller distances the assumption of the epstein regime breaks down . for the adiabatic case ,",
    "the epstein regime is valid for bodies up to 10  m in size because the density of the circumplanetary envelope is very low .",
    "however , since the gas there is very hot , the fastest migrating grains are smaller than for the isothermal and fld cases , having sizes in the range 0.06 to 0.1  m.    based on these results , we can expect that only very large boulders , i.e. those with sizes comfortably larger than indicated by the curves in figure  4 , e.g. in the range @xmath57  m , may experience a slow enough radial decay to allow the assembly of satellites in the disk .",
    "however , addressing whether or not satellites can really form will require to include grain growth and the stokes drag regime , as well as self - consistent initial sizes and velocities for boulders entering the circumplanetary disk .",
    "we have shown the disk thermodynamics has an impact on all the most important aspects of disk - planet interaction for jupiter - mass planets .",
    "the way migration and accretion are affected is qualitatively consistent with the findings by @xcite for low - mass planets , although in that work the effect was quantitatively much stronger .",
    "migration is slowed down relative to isothermal runs because heating modifies the relative strength of the inner and outer spiral arm , or stifles the spiral perturbations completely as in the case of adiabatic runs .",
    "this effect partially counterbalances the faster migration found in our isothermal disks relative to standard estimates that neglect viscosity , self - gravity and the motion of the planet .",
    "if the slower migration seen in radiative transfer runs persists over @xmath58 orbits one would expect the mean migration rate to differ from the estimates of standard type ii migration by no more than a factor of 2 , confirming the earlier conclusions reached by dangelo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using 2d simulations .",
    "the mass transport towards the planet is hampered by the increasing pressure gradient in non - isothermal runs .",
    "this will have to be investigated further by including a proper accretion model in the simulations @xcite .",
    "the different structure of the circumplanetary envelope depending on disk thermodynamics that we find is qualitatively in agreement with the results of @xcite , although our disks with flux - limited diffusion are less sub - keplerian than theirs .",
    "satellite formation is not easy in the thick circumplanetary disk , but it may still be possible provided that the solid component is dominated by large boulders .",
