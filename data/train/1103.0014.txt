    ", one question to be answered is whether such new discoveries will have sufficiently distinct spectra to invoke the proposed `` y '' spectral type @xcite .",
    "a well - established strategy for finding the coolest objects is to search for them as companions to other objects .",
    "this approach has been quite successful : the first l  and t  dwarfs were found as companions around hotter objects , gd  165b @xcite and gl  229b @xcite , respectively . to date , some of the coolest t  dwarfs are found as companions to stars : gl  570  d ( t7.5 ; @xcite ) , hd  3651  b ( t7.5 ; @xcite ) , ulas  j1416 + 13  b ( t7.5 ; ) , gj  758b ( @xmath7t8t9 ; @xcite ) wolf  940b ( t8.5 ; @xcite ) , and ross  458c ( t8.5 ; ) .",

    "the lgs brightness , as measured by the flux incident on the ao wavefront sensor , was equivalent to a @xmath15 and 10.3  mag star in may and july , respectively .    at each epoch , we obtained a series of dithered images by offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds between each 12 images .",

    "the raw images were reduced using standard methods of flat - fielding and sky - subtraction . after rejecting individual images of poor quality",
    ", we registered and stacked the data into a final mosaic . the binary s flux ratios and relative astrometry were derived by fitting an analytic model of the point spread function ( psf ) as the sum of two elliptical gaussians to the images of the binary in the mosaics .",
    "we did not correct the relative astrometry for instrumental optical distortion , as the size of the effect as predicted from a distortion solution by b. cameron ( priv .",

    "we used the facility wide - field near - ir camera wircam @xcite , which has four 2048@xmath232048 hawaii-2rg detectors , each with an approximate field - of - view of @xmath24 . at each epoch , we placed the target near the center of the northeast detector .",
    "the data were taken with slightly different observing procedures as they originated from two independent programs : at 3 of the epochs , images of 60-s @xmath23 6 coadds were obtained at 10 dither positions , and at the other 4 epochs , single 60-s images were obtained at 11 dither positions . the median fwhm of the data was 0@xmath2573 ( min / max of 0@xmath2555/0@xmath2580 ) .",
    "the target was always observed near transit , with a maximum deviation in airmass of 0.03 .",
    "this reduces any systematic offsets in the target s astrometry from the differential chromatic refraction between the late - t dwarf science target and the background stars to @xmath26  mas ( dupuy & liu , in preparation ) , well below the measurement noise .",
    "our wircam astrometry pipeline is described in detail by @xcite and dupuy & liu ( in prep ) and successfully generates parallaxes that are in accord with previously published results for l  and t  dwarfs .",
    "we use sextractor to generate an astrometric catalog of all the sources in every individual image .",
    "we then cross - match detections across dithered images and use the mean and rms of each source to determine its final position and error at that epoch ; we exclude any source that has fewer than 7 detections or a s /",
    "n less than  7 .",
    "we then cross - match these positions across different epochs , allowing for a full linear transformation in the astrometry to account for scale and orientation changes in the instrument .",
    "( wircam is installed and removed from the telescope for each observing run . ) after an initial iteration , we remove any stars with large proper motions ( @xmath27  mas / yr ) or parallaxes ( @xmath28 ) from the epoch - matching fit .",
    "finally , we absolutely calibrate our astrometry by matching to 2mass to determine the overall scale , orientation , and shear . for this target ,",
    "8  of our 72  reference stars were well - detected in 2mass and had sufficiently low proper motion ( @xmath29  mas / yr ) to be used for absolute calibration .",
    "we then fit for the proper motion and parallax of every source in the field .",

    "( to our knowledge , this is the faintest object outside the solar system with an optical or ir parallax measurement , cf . , . ) to account for the mean parallax of our reference stars , we used the besanon model of the galaxy to simulate the distance distribution of sources in the direction of  within the magnitude range of our images ( @xmath35  mag ) .",
    "we find a mean parallax of @xmath36  mas from the galaxy model , with the error accounting for the sampling variance due to the finite number of reference stars .",

    "the resulting tangential velocity ( 47@xmath25  ) is higher than the median for field t  dwarfs , but not extraordinary given the observed velocity dispersion of the field objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ table : astrometry ] contains our astrometry results .",
    "we obtained integrated - light near - ir spectra of  with the x - shooter spectrograph on vlt - ut2 ( program 085.c-0805 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in four 1-hour observing blocks ( hereafter ob ) from may  5 to july  9 , 2010 , achieving a total exposure time on target of 11700  sec , split into 8 a - b nods on the slit of 2 x 732  sec each .",
    "the slit width was 1.2 , and the seeing varied between 0.81.0 .",
    "we chose a large slit size , because direct acquisition of the target was impossible and we had to acquire using a blind offset from a reference source .",
    "the spectra for each ob were reduced using the standard eso x - shooter pipeline @xcite , which produced a 2-dimensional , curvature - corrected spectrum of the nir arm of x - shooter ( 1.02.5  ) .",
    "no signal was detected in the uvb and visible arm of the instrument .",
    "the trace was extracted using our own idl procedures , using gaussian boxes in the spatial dimension at each wavelength .",
    "a similar gaussian extraction box was used at about 5 times the fwhm of the trace to obtain the noise spectrum of the sky . the resulting 1-dimensional spectrum from each science target ob",
    "was then divided by the spectra of telluric stars observed just before or after , reduced and extracted using the same pipelines .",
    "the resulting 4 spectra from all the obs were then median combined to produce the final science spectrum . since the resulting spectrum ( with @xmath38 ) has low s / n and most analyses of late - t dwarfs have used much lower resolution spectra , we smoothed the spectra using a weighted average over 50 pixels in the wavelength dimension ( corresponding to 3  and 5  nm at @xmath12-band and @xmath17-band , respectively ) , weighting by the inverse variance of the extracted sky spectrum .",
    "this approach uses the full spectral resolution of x - shooter to give a much lower weight to wavelengths affected by telluric emission lines , thus improving the s / n with respect to simple unweighted binning using the average or median .",
    "given the large wavelength range covered by x - shooter , seeing variation in the spectral direction can led to wavelength - dependent slit losses . therefore , we flux - calibrated the spectrum using @xmath21 photometry of  from and @xmath39-band data from the ukidss data release  8 ( @xmath40  mag , on the vega system ) .",
    "following , we applied small scaling factors to each of the broadband wavelength ranges so that the magnitudes derived from the  spectrum matched the photometry .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "examination of the digitized sky survey images shows no plausible optical counterpart if component  b were a background object .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11-band imaging from july 2004 presented in shows no star to a depth of @xmath4124  mag , 23  mag deeper than expected for a background m  star if it had the near - ir magnitude of component  b. in fact , the high proper motion of the source means that our two keck epochs separated by 1.5 months are sufficient to confirm the two components are physically associated .",
    "( for the july 2010 epoch , we choose the keck @xmath1-band astrometry , which has the smallest errors . )",
    "figure  [ fig : background ] shows the large expected motion for component  b if it were an object at infinite distance , given our measured proper motion and parallax for .",
    "( the proper motion dominates over the parallax . ) in contrast , the relative positions of the two components do not change between our observations .",
    "the length of the vector between the observed and predicted change is non - zero at 9.1@xmath42 .",
    "thus , we conclude the two components are physically associated .",
    "the integrated - light spectrum of ab is very similar to other recent very late - t dwarf discoveries ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "as seen by its narrower continuum peak , its @xmath12-band spectrum shows slightly stronger absorption than the t9  dwarfs cfbds  j0059@xmath1001 , ulas  j0034@xmath1000 , and ulas  j1335 + 11 and is very close to the t10  dwarf .",
    "suggests it may also be present in ab .",
    "however , while the detection is significant in terms of s / n , it appears much broader than in the  spectrum .",
    "also , lucas et al .",
    "reports a second absorption feature at 1.282  , which coincides with a local peak in the ab spectrum .",
    "thus our spectra do not confirm either of these proposed features . ]",
    "( we caution that spectral types later than t8 are an active topic of investigation , without a classification system established yet . for this discussion , we simply adopt the published types for these objects , which may ultimately change once a system is defined . ) in the @xmath1 band however ,  is more similar to the warmer objects , especially on the blue side of the peak .",
    "the absorption on the red side of the @xmath1-band is the strongest observed in any known brown dwarf ( see the ch@xmath43-h index in table  [ table : indices ] ) .",
    "this might be due to enhanced collision induced absorption ( cia ) of  starting to suppress the @xmath1-band peak ; this notion fits well with the strongly depressed @xmath17-band flux of  compared to the other late - t dwarfs , where the strongest continuum absorber is cia  .",
    "the suppression could be due to either strong gravity or low metallicity , and distinguishing between the two can be challenging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "using model atmospheres , @xcite and @xcite show that the shape of the @xmath39-band continuum is more metallicity - dependent than gravity - dependent ( though their two sets of models show different amplitudes for these effects ) .",
    "the main absorbers on the blue side of the @xmath39-band peak are the pressure broadened wings of the and fundamental doublets , which naturally decrease with lower metallicity ; more metal - rich models also have the @xmath39-band peak at redder wavelengths and the overall @xmath39-band flux being fainter .",
    "the observed @xmath39-band spectra of ab does not show any strong differences with  and cfbds  j0059@xmath1001 ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , though the peak might be slightly redder than the other two objects , perhaps hinting at a greater metallicity ( though this would be discrepant with the highly suppressed @xmath17-band ) .",
    "overall , we favor the higher gravity explanation , though a better spectrum at shorter wavelengths would help to investigate this further .",
    "taken altogether , the spectrum of ab shows that this object is slightly earlier than  and possibly higher gravity , but later than the known t9  dwarfs .",
    "thus , we provisionally assign a spectral type of t9.5 , though of course it may turn out to be earlier or later type , depending on the future development of classification for such cool objects .      to quantify the absorption features of , , cia  , and possibly nh@xmath44 , we calculated spectral indices previously used for t  dwarfs .",
    "the measurements ( table  [ table : indices ] ) indicate that a has some of the strongest absorption features seen in the near - ir spectra of late t dwarfs , exceeded by only  for the @xmath45 and nh@xmath44-h indices .",
    "given the @xmath72  magnitudes flux difference between component  a and  b , it is reasonable to consider the integrated spectrum is dominated by the primary ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we use the solar - abundance bt - settl-2009 models @xcite to estimate  and  for component  a from the index measurements .",
    "we compensate for the systematic errors of the models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by scaling their index predictions to match those measured for the t8.5 benchmark wolf  940b @xcite .",
    "its high quality spectrophotometry , parallax , and age estimate from its primary star enable a precise estimate of its properties using evolutionary models (  =  575  k ;  =  4.75 , [ m / h]=0 from @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . with this approach",
    ", the temperatures and gravities for the @xmath3t8 dwarfs derived from an index - index plot broadly agree with the values derived from the analysis of their full near - ir spectra .",
    "since the systematic errors in the models in this low - temperature regime are likely much larger than the measurement errors , we use the model grid only for relative estimates of temperature and gravity differences among the late - t dwarfs , not absolute measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : indices ] indicates that a is as cool as  and @xmath4650  k or more cooler than the other @xmath3t8 dwarfs .",
    "( the caveat is that the model analysis assumes a single metallicity for all the objects , consistent with the similarity in @xmath39-band shapes discussed above . )",
    "the plot also puts a at a higher ( @xmath460.5  dex ) surface gravity than the other objects , as expected from the highly suppressed @xmath17-band flux .",
    "the higher gravity suggests that  is older and higher mass than , consistent with their relative tangential velocities ( @xmath47  and @xmath48  , respectively ) .",
    "of course , tangential velocities are only a statistical proxy for age so this comparison should be treated accordingly .    to assess the impact of component  b on the integrated - light spectrum , we used the bt - settl-2009 model atmospheres to create composite spectra .",
    "we chose models with 600700  k for the primary and 400500  k for the secondary , matching pairs of models with 200250  k temperature differences and the same surface gravity .",
    "the pairs of spectra were scaled to agree with the observed @xmath12-band or @xmath1-band flux ratio and summed to form artificial composites .",
    "we then added noise based on the measured s / n of the vlt spectrum and measured the same indices .",
    "we found that the blended composites had very similar index values as the input primary spectrum alone , with systematic effects at the 520% level , typically 10% .",
    "such amplitudes are not sufficient to affect the interpretation of figure  [ fig : indices ] .",
    "to further place ab in context , we perform a homogeneous comparison of the near - ir spectra of very late - t dwarfs to low - temperature atmospheric models .",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath49t8  dwarfs with parallaxes , excluding the aforementioned possible binary t8  dwarf 2mass  j0939@xmath1024 , but also include two benchmark t7.5  dwarfs ( table  [ table : atmmodels ] ) .",
    "we use the published @xmath12-band photometry to establish the absolute flux calibration of the spectra , again assuming the primary dominates the integrated - light spectrum . for",
    ", we again assumed that the integrated - light spectrum is dominated by component  a and normalized it using the resolved @xmath12-band photometry of component  a.    we fit three grids of atmospheric models : ( 1 )  the ames - cond models @xcite spanning @xmath50  k ( @xmath51  k ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ; ( 2 )  the tucson models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bsl03 ) , which are irregularly gridded between @xmath54  k and @xmath55  ( cgs ) ; and ( 3 ) the aforementioned bt - settl-2009 models spanning 4001200  k and  = 4.06.0  dex ( @xmath56  k above 600  k and 100  k below 600",
    "all grids are for solar metallicity compositions and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the models were gaussian smoothed to the resolution of the data and interpolated onto the wavelength grid of the observed spectrum .",
    "the atmospheric models have known systematic errors , particularly in the @xmath39-band and the red side of the @xmath1-band as a result of imperfect modeling of the pressure - broadened doublet in the far - red and the incomplete list of ch@xmath43 lines , respectively .",
    "we therefore restrict our fits to the 1.151.35  @xmath57 m , 1.451.6  @xmath57 m , and 1.952.25  @xmath57 m spectral regions .",
    "the model emergent spectra are scaled to the flux calibrated spectra by minimizing the @xmath58 statistic ( e.g. , equation 5 and 6 of @xcite ) . for",
    "observed spectra without measurement errors ( cfbds  j0059@xmath1001 and ) we perform a least - squares fit to the data ( equation  1 of @xcite with @xmath59=1 , and the scaling factor is solved for by equating the derivative of @xmath60 with zero ) .",
    "the best - fitting models are summarized in table  [ table : atmmodels ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : modelfits ] .",
    "the ames - cond models yield effective temperatures between 700800  k and a gravity of 4.5  dex for almost all objects ; the temperatures for the latest - type objects are @xmath7100200  k hotter than analyses from their discovery papers ( which use variants of the bt - settl models ) .",
    "the bsl03 models typically produce much cooler temperatures ( 420800  k ) and somewhat higher gravities ( 4.64.8  dex ) , with the results for the earlier - type objects often at the edge of the model grid , indicating a broader set of models is probably needed .",
    "the bt - settl-2009 model results are usually intermediate between those from the other two models .",
    "the fits show that cfbds  j0059@xmath1001 , ab , and  are the three coldest objects in the sample , with the ames - cond models indicating all have comparable temperatures while the bsl03 and bt - settl-2009 models indicate that ab is the warmest .",
    "( note that in terms of the absolute values derived from the fitting , the analysis in the appendix on the resulting spectroscopic distances suggests that the temperatures may be somewhat overestimated . )    again , to assess the effect of component  b on the analysis of the integrated - light spectrum , we took the artificial noisy composite spectra described in   [ sec : indices ] and applied the same model atmosphere fitting procedure .",
    "we found that the s determined for the composite spectra were at worst 50  k colder than those of the input primary spectrum alone , and often the same .",
    "the fitted surface gravities were the same for the composites and the primary spectrum .",
    "thus , the blended light from the much fainter secondary appears to have little consequence for our analysis , as expected .",
    "we also examine another method to derive physical properties from atmospheric models .",
    "although the distance estimates using the scaling factor @xmath61 may differ substantially from the true distances , the known distance can be used in combination with the scaling factor , a grid of radii , and a likely age range to infer a temperature and mass range for the object .",
    "this is effectively using the scaling factor as a proxy for temperature , and it has the benefit of relying on the absolute level of the model emergent flux density rather than the detailed shape of the synthetic spectrum , which may have systematic errors . using the results from table  [ table : atmmodels ] , we compute the range of effective temperatures and masses for the three sets of models .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table : tempmass ] assuming an age range of 110  gyrs , except for ross  458c where we assume an age of 0.11.0  gyr @xcite .",

    "as discussed above , the bluer color is likely due to a higher surface gravity ( i.e. , an older age ) compared to most other late - t  dwarfs .",

    "being significantly fainter than previously known brown dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) , the properties of b provide a first look at the empirical trends beyond spectral type t10 , especially enlightening given the uncertainties in model atmosphere predictions for such cold objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "measuring the differential deuterium abundance would help constrain the age of the system , analogous to the binary lithium test proposed by @xcite .",
    "the deuterium depletion timescales are long for such low - mass objects , so the exact age at which they become fully depleted is fuzzy . using a finely interpolated version of the lyon / cond models and constrained by the observed luminosity of each component , we find that the full range of 99% to 0% deuterium content for the primary is 0.51.3  gyr , while the the 990% deuterium range for the secondary is 2.35.4  gyr .",

    "note that the deuterium abundance is expected to be difficult to measure @xcite .",
    "an additional complication is the theoretical predictions for the d - burning limit depend on the metallicity , initial d and he abundances , and atmospheric boundary conditions and can range from @xmath71114  @xcite .      to estimate the orbital period of the binary ,",
    "we adopt the statistical conversion factor between projected separation and true semi - major axis from @xcite .",

    "the near - ir spectral progression observed for the t8t10 dwarfs is subtle , as the  bands are nearly fully absorbed .",
    "such late - type objects are distinguished from each other by only modest changes in the shape of the near - ir flux peaks , though the thermal - ir ( @xmath84  ) colors are more distinctive @xcite .",

    "regardless of its final spectral classification ,  provides a gateway into new processes in low - temperature atmospheres .",
    "models by @xcite predict the disappearance of the very broad sodium ( 0.59  ) and potassium ( 0.77  ) resonance lines at @xmath87  k , comparable to the estimated temperature of b. ( see also @xcite . )",

    "indeed , the subtle changes seen in the near - ir seds of late - t dwarfs , combined with the strong alkali line depletion predicted at @xmath80500  k , suggest that far - red optical wavelengths may become valuable for spectral classification of the coolest new discoveries .",
    "the fact that b resides in a binary system of known distance offers additional future opportunties for understanding the coldest brown dwarfs .",

    "<S> , we estimate a temperature of 370@xmath240  k and a mass of 615  for b. at such extremes , atmospheric models predict the onset of novel photospheric processes , namely the appearance of water clouds and the removal of strong alkali lines , but their impact on the emergent spectrum is highly uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> our photometry shows that strong  absorption persists at @xmath1-band ; the @xmath5 color is bluer than the latest known t  dwarfs but not as blue as predicted by current models ; and the @xmath6 color delineates a possible inflection in the blueward trend for the latest t  dwarfs . given its low luminosity , atypical colors and cold temperature , b is a promising candidate for the hypothesized y  spectral class . </S>",
