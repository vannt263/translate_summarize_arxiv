    "the electron is elementary particle , embodied with intrinsic properties such as charge , mass , spin and magnetic dipole moment .",
    "historically , there are number of proposed extended classical models of electron @xcite encompassing classical properties effectively .",
    "however , these models not only suffer from the electron instability problem but also are unable to explain the quantum mechanical ( qm ) behavior of electron . on the other hand , the celebrated qm model of dirac @xcite",
    "is an abstract mathematical model , which incorporates the intrinsic properties of electron in terms of dirac matrices and @xmath10-component wavefunction .",
    "dirac s later works on extended model of electron @xcite attempts to expound its classical properties .",
    "however , on the conceptual background the comprehension of the abstract point qm model and its possible association to electrons s properties is still not well clear .",
    "while working on dirac electron in an external electromagnetic field , foldy - wouthuysen noted that the particle spreads out over a region of dimension of the order of its compton wavelength in space with its mean position @xmath11 .",
    "this behavior of the particle lead to the proposal of extended model of electron @xcite . due to some reasons , the extended models or their interpretation such as the one given in @xcite did nt get much attention .",
    "the detail studies on dirac model by schrdinger and others @xcite show that the electron undergoes an internal oscillatory motion having dimension of the order of compton wavelength , called zitterbewegung ( ztg ) . from the dirac equation of motion for a free electron ,",
    "schrdinger showed that even in linear motion the electron executes an oscillatory motion with a frequency @xmath12 , where all the parameters bear their traditional meaning .",
    "he further concluded that the instantaneous velocity of a slowly moving electron is @xmath1 .",
    "recently the electron model proposed by alexander burinskii @xcite considers electron as a closed gravitational singular string , based on kerr - newman theory .",
    "the model is essentially in curved space time geometry .",
    "similarly , the electron model @xcite uses ( @xmath13 ) ricci flat space time geometry to obtain exact solutions of the maxwell s and gauged dirac equations .",
    "these solutions are interpreted in terms of a geometric model of the electron with its spin .",
    "hence these models are inherently geometric ones , based on curved or ( @xmath13 ) space - time , instead of a flat spacetime geometry .",
    "again these models do not institute some physical mechanism(s ) at the core level . using the maxwell s theory with the boundary condition of spherical conducting surface",
    ", dirac presented an electron model @xcite , which explains the existence of muon as the excited state of electron , however , it does not assign spin to the electron .    in a very recent study , a traveling wave electromagnetic ( twem ) model for electron",
    "is presented @xcite .",
    "the model is based on rotating em wave confined in a circle with radius equal to the reduced compton wavelength ( rcw ) ( @xmath14 ) of electron using maxwell s theory as a physical mechanism at the core level . in twem model",
    "the electric field vector @xmath15 ( a dirac delta vector ) rotates in the @xmath16 plane and the corresponding magnetic field vector @xmath17 is pseudo static dirac delta vector along the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the em wave traverses a circular trajectory with rcw of the electron in half space .",
    "the radius and energy of the modeled electron , matches precisely to the classical counterparts .",
    "the stability of em electron is ensured by showing zero divergence of source - free em  energy - momentum stress tensor for the model .",
    "the charge generation mechanism has been discussed at length using gauge of em  fields .",
    "the time reversal in travelling wave corresponds to the reversal of @xmath19 and @xmath20 fields , which in turn gives rise to antiparticle ( the positron ) rotating em wave . with four possible time - space ( @xmath21 ) combinations we obtain four types of em rotating waves .",
    "the overall picture at this level conforms the local @xmath22 gauge symmetry . the monochromatic circulating em  wave , carry the corresponding energy - momentum in half the rcw of electron .",
    "the ztg phenomenon arises naturally in this model as a consequence of circular flow of em energy- momentum .    in this paper",
    "we use the twem model to demonstrate the electron s internal structure in terms of circular flow of energy - momentum ( @xmath23 ) at velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the two component wavefunction for energy - momentum , corresponding to left and right circular polarized wave(s ) is shown to be related to the spin of electron , conforming to @xmath24 group symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the negative and positive time circulating energy - momentum are shown to correspond to four component dirac like spinor . in the rest frame , the four components of spinor satisfy massless klein gordon equation , which in turn leads to a massless dirac or weyl equation , governed by transformation rule under covering group @xmath25 of proper lorentz group @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the massive dirac equation for twem electron has been obtained in boosted frame linking em electron model with qm .",
    "the internal dynamical structure of electron based on ztg can be experimentally verified in line with experiments of electron channeling in silicon crystals @xcite . in electron channeling experiment , the momentum resonance is observed at twice the de broglie frequency , that is at @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 .",
    "the authors describe it as a manifestation of de broglie internal clock if squared amplitude is considered , that is , the ztg frequency . in our proposed model",
    "the frequency of momentum is twice the de broglie frequency of em circulating wave .",
    "this is in good agreement with the phenomena observed in the electron channelling experiment .",

    "the oscillatory part , having extremely small amplitude , was believed unobservable directly @xcite . however",
    ", a recent simulated work @xcite on one dimensional dirac dynamics for free particle shows that the ztg is an observable phenomenon .",
    "also , @xcite proposes an experiment with ultracold atoms in a tripod level scheme on an optical lattice , to observe ztg , at experimentally measurable frequencies .",
