    "total reaction cross section models have a significant impact on the predictions and accuracy of spallation and transport codes . the latest version of the cascade exciton model ( cem )  @xcite as incorporated in the code cem03.03  @xcite , and the monte carlo n - particle transport code ( mcnp6 )  @xcite , both developed at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) , each use such cross sections for different purposes . while total reaction cross sections are used throughout the transport and spallation models , there are two main utilizations .",
    "mcnp6 uses total reaction cross sections to determine where a reaction occurs ( through the mean - free path length ) , and then with what nucleus the projectile interacts with , and lastly what type of interaction it is ( inelastic or elastic ) .",
    "cem uses total reaction cross sections as _ inverse _ cross sections to predict what the excited nucleus emits .",
    "phenomenological approximations of total reaction cross sections are also used by cem03.03 as the default option for normalization of all results in the case of reactions induced by protons and neutrons , when cem03.03 is used as a stand alone code , outside any transport codes ; see details in refs .",

    "having accurate total reaction cross section models in the intermediate energy region ( @xmath050 mev to @xmath05 gev ) is important for many different applications .",

    "medical applications include hadron therapy for cancer @xcite , radiation shielding , medical isotope production , and high - radiation environment dosimetry .",
    "other applications include accelerator design and simulation .",
    "in addition , implementing better inverse cross sections in cem should provide more reliable predictions ; that is , our current work should be useful also from an academic point of view , allowing us to better understand the mechanisms of nuclear reactions .",

    "our improvement of the inverse cross sections used by cem03.03 addresses directly this point , both for a better description of light fragments , but also of nucleons .",

    "there are several implications of this work on mcnp6 .",
    "cem03.03 is the default event - generator in mcnp6 for high - energy collisions induced by nucleons , pions , and gammas at energies up to several gevs .",
    "improvements to the cem inverse cross sections should , therefore , result in improved predictions of particle spectra and total production cross sections , especially above @xmath0100 mev and for fragments heavier than @xmath1he , among other results .",
    "mcnp6 uses the updated barashenkov and polanski total reaction cross section systematics to simulate the mean - free path of neutrons , protons , and light fragments up to @xmath1he .",
    "it uses a parameterization based on a geometric cross section for fragments heavier than @xmath1he .",
    "possible direct improvement of mcnp6 may be obtained by replacing the barashenkov and polanski model with nasa systematics and by replacing the geometric cross section approach with the better nasa model .",
