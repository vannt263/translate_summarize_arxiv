    "quantum information theory exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to devise novel means of processing , manipulating and transmitting information . among the most celebrated applications one finds quantum computing and quantum cryptography .",
    "the latter allows a secure key distribution among two distant partners , the security of the distributed key being guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the linearity of quantum mechanics implies that an unknown quantum state can not be copied @xcite .",
    "thus any attempt by an eavesdropper to learn about the state transmitted from the sender to the receiver will unavoidably introduce some noise , which can be detected at the receiver s station .",
    "although perfect copying is forbidden it is still possible to carry out an approximate cloning of quantum states .",
    "this issue has attracted a lot of attention during the recent years and the optimal universal symmetric cloning machines which produce @xmath2 approximate copies out of @xmath3 inputs have been found @xcite . in the context of quantum cryptography ,",
    "one is particularly interested in the asymmetric cloning machines which produce two clones with different fidelities @xcite .",
    "this allows one to study the interplay between the information gained by an eavesdropper and the noise introduced in the channel .",
    "importantly , the asymmetric cloning proved to be a very efficient ( or even optimal ) individual eavesdropping attack on certain kinds of qkd protocols @xcite .",
    "recently , optimal asymmetric @xmath1 cloning of qubits encoded as polarization states of single photons has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite",
    ".    however , the universal asymmetric cloning machines considered in the literature @xcite are only conjectured to be optimal , and so far the proof of optimality has been missing ( except for the qubit case @xcite ) . in this paper , we provide such a proof .",
    "we will then go beyond the @xmath1 asymmetric cloning and shall consider a novel class of universal asymmetric machines which produce three clones , each of them with possibly different fidelity .",
    "these machines were recently proposed and briefly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which introduced the general concept of a fully asymmetric @xmath4 cloning machine producing @xmath2 approximate clones with @xmath2 different fidelities . in this paper",
    "we expand this discussion and derive explicitly the optimal cloning transformation , present the details of the optimality proof , and provide a simple parametric description of the optimal universal asymmetric @xmath0 cloning machines in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we expect that our findings will play an important role in investigations of multi - party quantum communication protocols and quantum information distribution in quantum networks .",
    "an independent similar study of multipartite asymmetric cloning of qubits is reported in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we prove the optimality of the universal @xmath1 asymmetric cloning machines for qudits . in section iii",
    "we investigate the fully asymmetric optimal universal quantum triplicators which produce three approximate clones with three different fidelities .",
    "finally , section iv contains a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "let us begin by briefly reviewing an isomorphism between completely positive maps @xmath5 and positive semidefinite operators @xmath6 on the tensor product of the input and output hilbert spaces of map @xmath5 , denoted respectively as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "consider a maximally entangled state on @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "if the map @xmath5 is applied to the second subsystem while nothing happens to the first one , the resulting ( generally mixed ) quantum state contains all the information about the map . qualitatively speaking , if we project the first subsystem onto the ( complex conjugate of the ) input state so that the second subsystem is projected onto the input state , then , after applying @xmath5 , it is left in the corresponding output state .",
    "the first subsystem is therefore conventionally called the reference system , denoted with the subscript @xmath12 , since it keeps a memory of the state that was processed in the channel .",
    "mathematically , the positive semidefinite operator @xmath13 is therefore isomorphic to the map @xmath5 , where the subscript @xmath14 denotes here the output system , @xmath15 , and the prefactor @xmath16 has been introduced for normalization purposes . the fact that the map @xmath5 is trace preserving indeed implies the condition @xmath17=\\openone_r .",
    "\\label{tracepreservation}\\ ] ] the map @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of @xmath18 as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the transposition in the schmidt basis of state @xmath21 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath18 describes the @xmath1 cloning transformation of qudits .",
    "the output hilbert space is endowed with tensor product structure , @xmath22 , where the subscripts @xmath23 and @xmath24 label the two clones . for each particular input state @xmath25",
    ", we can calculate the fidelity of each clone as follows , @xmath26 where @xmath12 labels the input system and @xmath27 is a short hand notation for the density matrix of a pure state .",
    "we are usually interested in the average performance of the cloning machine , which can be quantified by the mean fidelities , @xmath28 where the measure @xmath29 determines the kind of the cloning machines we are dealing with .",
    "universal cloning machines which clone equally well all states from the input hilbert space correspond to choosing @xmath29 to be the haar measure on the group @xmath30 .",
    "the fidelities ( [ fab ] ) are linear functions of the operator @xmath18 , @xmath31 , \\qquad f_{b}=\\mathrm{tr}[s l_b],\\ ] ] where the positive semidefinite operators @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 in case of universal cloning , the integral over @xmath29 can be easily calculated with the help of schur s lemma , and we get , for instance , @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath35 denotes a projector onto symmetric subspace of two qudits , @xmath36 is the dimension of this subspace , and @xmath37 stands for transposition with respect to the subsystem @xmath12 .",

    "the maximization of @xmath45 for a given value of @xmath44 can be equivalently rephrased as a maximization of @xmath41 for a fixed value of @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that we find @xmath18 that maximizes @xmath45 .",
    "it is then clear that for a given @xmath40 this map yields maximum possible @xmath47 , because any higher @xmath47 would increase @xmath45 .",
    "this explains why optimal asymmetric cloners can be found simply by maximizing the convex mixture of single - clone fidelities with variable mixing ratio .",
    "the maximum achievable @xmath45 is upper bounded by the maximum eigenvalue @xmath48 of the operator @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the trace - preservation condition , we have @xmath50 although this bound need not be saturated in general @xcite , it is reached by the optimal asymmetric @xmath1 universal cloning machines , as we shall show below .",
    "it follows that we have to calculate the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath51\\ ] ] with @xmath52 we can neglect the trivial part of @xmath49 which is proportional to the identity operator , and only need to investigate the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath53 .",
    "luckily , this problem is greatly simplified by noting that @xmath53 has a support of dimension @xmath54 , spanned by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 has at most @xmath54 non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , it turns out that there are only two @xmath16-fold degenerate eigenvalues , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    ". the two eigenvalues @xmath62 are roots of the quadratic equation @xmath63=0\\ ] ] and the ratio @xmath64 , which fixes the eigenstate ( [ rtilde ] ) , can be expressed in terms of @xmath65 , @xmath44 , and @xmath16 as @xmath66 since @xmath65 is real , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are both real and @xmath69 . by properly normalizing the eigenstates @xmath70 , we get @xmath71    the optimal cloning transformation @xmath18 is then simply the projector onto the @xmath16-dimensional sub - space spanned by the eigenstates @xmath72 corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath57 , @xmath73 note that @xmath74 hence both @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eq .",

    "moreover , @xmath76 by construction , which proves the optimality .",

( [ alphabetanorm ] ) , we get @xmath78 = d-\\frac{d^2 - 1}{d}\\ , \\beta^2 , \\quad \\mathrm{tr}[s \\tilde{l}_{b } ] = d-\\frac{d^2 - 1}{d}\\ , \\alpha^2.\\ ] ] therefore , we obtain for the fidelities of the asymmetric cloner @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the so - called depolarizing fractions as discussed in ref .",
    "the expressions ( [ alphabetanorm ] ) and ( [ fidelitiesab ] ) exactly coincide with the formula characterizing the class of asymmetric cloning machines derived in @xcite , which therefore is optimal .",
    "the optimal cloning map ( [ sduplicatoroptimal ] ) can be realized unitarily by purifying @xmath18 into the state @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for an ancillary system , that is , we get @xmath18 when tracing over @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting isometry that transforms the input single - qudit state @xmath25 onto the output state of three qudits ( two clones and one anti - clone ) can be written , by projecting the reference system @xmath12 onto @xmath84 , as @xmath85",
    "having proved the optimality of the universal asymmetric @xmath1 cloning machines , we now use the same techniques to construct the optimal universal asymmetric @xmath0 cloners .",
    "these machines produce three clones , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath86 , each clone possibly having a different fidelity ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath87 ) .",
    "the optimal asymmetric cloning machine should maximize the cloning fidelities such that for a given pair of fidelities ( say @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) the fidelity of the third clone ( @xmath87 ) is maximum .",
    "the output hilbert space of the asymmetric quantum triplicator is a tensor product of hilbert spaces of the three clones .",
    "the average fidelity of @xmath88th clone can be again expressed as @xmath89 $ ] with @xmath90 , where now @xmath91\\otimes\\openone_{bc},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 indicates the reference , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be obtained by cyclic permutation of @xmath94 . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ convexmixture ] ) , the optimal asymmetric @xmath0 cloning machine should maximize a convex combination of the three single - clone fidelities , @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the asymmetry of the cloner is determined by the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 . the fidelity ( [ fabc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath100 $ ] , where @xmath101 .",
    "similarly as in the case of @xmath1 cloning , we have to determine the eigenspace corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath102 , \\label{rabc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 due to the high symmetry , the operator @xmath53 has only six different non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "three of them are @xmath36-fold degenerate and the corresponding eigenstates read , @xmath104 with @xmath105 . here",
    "we take @xmath106 if @xmath107 , while @xmath108 .",
    "the three eigenvalues ( @xmath109 ) can be determined as roots of the cubic equation @xmath110 and the coefficients @xmath111 can be expressed in terms of @xmath112 , and @xmath113 by solving the system of linear equations @xmath114 the normalization of the eigenstate @xmath115 imposes the constraint @xmath116 the other three eigenvalues correspond to the anti - symmetric combinations of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , that is , @xmath119 , and are thus @xmath120-fold degenerate .",
    "the eigenstates are given by @xmath121 with @xmath122 , and the cubic equation for the eigenvalues @xmath123 reads @xmath124 since the polynomials @xmath125 and @xmath126 differ only in their zeroth order terms , their graphs look identical up to a vertical shift of @xmath127 .",
    "this simple geometrical observation reveals that the maximum eigenvalue @xmath128 is always larger than the maximum eigenvalue @xmath129 .",
    "hence , in determining the optimal cloning transformation , which corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue of ( [ rabc ] ) , we have to consider only the eigenstates ( [ rklplus ] ) .",
    "it follows from the structure of the operator @xmath53 that @xmath130 .",
    "this , together with eq .",
    "( [ alfabetagamma ] ) implies that the coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath131 of an eigenstate corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath132 must be all positive ( or all negative ) .",
    "the optimal trace - preserving @xmath133 cloning map can then be expressed simply as the properly normalized projector onto the subspace spanned by the @xmath36 eigenstates ( [ rklplus ] ) with eigenvalue @xmath128 , @xmath134 .",
    "a unitary implementation of this cp map requires two ancilla systems , @xmath83 and @xmath45 , and can be characterized by the purification of @xmath18 , namely @xmath135 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the identity @xmath136 and the normalization constant is @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , by projecting @xmath12 onto @xmath84 , we see that any pure input state @xmath25 transforms according to @xmath138 .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be easily verified that this transformation is universal , i.e. the single - clone fidelities do not depend on the output state .",

    "1 we plot the trade - off between @xmath46 and @xmath47 for several different values of the fidelity of the third clone @xmath87 for @xmath0 asymmetric cloning of qubits , @xmath142 . note , that in the limit where one of the three coefficients @xmath111 is equal to zero the asymmetric @xmath0 cloning essentially reduces to the optimal asymmetric @xmath1 cloning .",
    "however , even in this case the fidelity of the third clone is larger than @xmath143 , which is what one could have naively expected .",
    "this interesting effect is clearly visible in fig .",
    "the endpoints of the curves showing the trade - off between @xmath46 and @xmath47 for a fixed @xmath87 correspond to optimal @xmath1 asymmetric cloning in the subspace of qubits @xmath23 and @xmath86 ( or @xmath24 and @xmath86 ) .",
    "note that the endpoints do not lie on the line @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and the fidelity @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) is thus higher than @xmath143 even in this limit case .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood by noting that in the @xmath1 cloning , the ancilla ( anti - clone ) carries some information about the input and a third clone with fidelity larger than @xmath143 can be produced simply by applying the optimal approximate universal - not gate @xcite to the anti - clone .",
    "in particular , for @xmath146 and @xmath147 we obtain the optimal triplet of fidelities @xmath148 and @xmath149 . the three clones exhibiting these fidelities can be prepared by first performing the optimal symmetric @xmath1 universal cloning which produces two clones with fidelity @xmath150 .",
    "the third clone is then obtained from the anti - clone by applying the approximate unot which yields a clone with fidelity exactly @xmath151 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated asymmetric universal cloning in arbitrary dimension .",
    "we have proved the optimality of the universal asymmetric @xmath1 cloning machines that have been previously considered as possible efficient attacks on certain classes of quantum key distribution protocols .",
