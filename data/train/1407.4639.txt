    "the quantum fluctuations during inflation can provide tiny primordial density perturbations which seed the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure of our universe . since the hubble parameter during inflation is roughly a constant , both the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations are nearly scale - invariant .",
    "usually the small scale dependence of scalar power spectrum is measured by the spectral index @xmath0 and then the amplitude of scalar power spectrum can be parametrized by p_s = a_s @xmath1^n_s-1 , where @xmath2 is the pivot scale and @xmath3 is the amplitude at @xmath4 .",

    "the observed b - mode power spectrum is well fitted by a lensed-@xmath11cdm+tensor model with r=0.20_-0.05^+0.07 .",
    "since the contaminant on the b - mode spectrum from the polarized dust gives a similar behavior in the multipoles around @xmath14 @xcite , it is still difficult to distinguish the signal of primordial gravitational waves from the dust .",
    "if the signal from bicep2 is confirmed to be originated from the primordial gravitational waves by the upcoming data sets , it must be a breakthrough for the basic science . because the primordial gravitational waves can also make a contribution to @xmath15 on the low multipoles , it suppresses the contribution to @xmath15 from scalar perturbation and hence @xmath16 for the scalar power spectrum is preferred on the large scales @xcite . in order to reconcile the different values of spectral index at different scales ,",

    "we work in the unit of @xmath24 .",
    "the above relation is called the lyth bound @xcite . if the signal from bicep2 stands after further cosmological observations and turns out to be primordial , the lyth bound implies that a large field inflation model should be called for .",

    "one may expect that the inflation ended and our universe was re - heated around the local minimum of the potential where @xmath30 is set by the condition that the potential equals zero at its local minimum .    in this letter",
