    "we also studied uncertainties due to radial beam position and beam spread , which we found to be negligible .    for the calculation of @xmath2 ( eq .  [ eq : branch ] ) , the uncertainty in the summing correction @xmath60 and the @xmath35-ray efficiency @xmath77 are negligible because coincidence measurements with the scintillator determine @xmath95 to 1% accuracy .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath96 was determined from the fits explained in sec  [ sec : efficiency ] to be 6.2% .",
