    "in recent times , numerous observations and methods have been used and proposed for constraining cosmological parameters . these include observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , from the _ wmap _ team @xcite and _",
    "planck _ team @xcite , baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) peaks @xcite , type ia supernovae ( sne , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravitational lensing @xcite and the abundance of clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "many of these methods use quantities which require the hubble parameter to be integrated along the line  of  sight ( e.g. the luminosity distance in supernovae observations ) and thus probe average expansion over a long period . a complementary technique known as _ cosmic chronometers _ ( cc ) , originally proposed by @xcite , uses passively evolving early  type galaxies to measure the hubble parameter at a specific redshift , rather than a quantity which gives an integrated measurement of @xmath6 out to redshift @xmath8 .",
    "this technique is independent of the cosmological model and allows a determination of the expansion rate at a given redshift without relying on the nature of the metric between the chronometers and observers , and therefore can provide tighter constraints on cosmological parameters of the model .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath6 at redshifts @xmath9 0 can be obtained by @xmath10 in the cc method , @xmath11 is approximated by determining the time interval @xmath12 corresponding to a given @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is centered at redshift @xmath8 . if one assumes that most stars in luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) formed near the beginning of the universe at a similar time ( as supported by observations cited in @xcite ) , then measuring the age difference between ensembles of lrgs at two different redshifts provides the differential quantity @xmath14 required to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "the biggest advantage of this method is the differential approach where the relative ages @xmath12 are used instead of the absolute ages .",
    "the relatives ages diminish the systematic effects underlying the absolute age estimates .",
    "furthermore , the use of the small redshift slices @xmath13 , which corresponds to a short time evolution of these massive and passive galaxies , controls the effect of some observation biases such as the progenitor bias .",
    "more discussions about avoiding this effect can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cc method has been used to measure the hubble parameter up to redshift @xmath15 and these results have been used to constrain the nature of dark energy and to recover the local hubble constant @xcite . in each measurement",
    ", the authors assumed that lrgs are massive , passively - evolving elliptical galaxies that are homogeneous populations forming their stars at high redshift , and they fit single ",
    "burst equivalent ages to the galaxies .",
    "these galaxies represent the ideal population to trace the differential age evolution of the universe . in many of the papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the authors have attempted to improve this method by pointing out the need for better fitting of stellar population models , better selection of targets , larger samples , and better quality data to precisely determine @xmath6 .",
    "the age  dating of galaxies is an important topic in the study of the galaxy evolution . during the last few decades",
    ", it has been widely exploited by the creation of synthetic stellar population tools .",
    "there are number of stellar population synthesis codes available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) which can be used to generate synthetic spectra to determine different parameters such as age , metallicity , chemical abundance and star formation history of a galaxy .",
    "typically two approaches are used for fitting models to data : ( i ) full  spectrum fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and ( ii ) techniques which fit features in the spectra such as lick  index fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we explored one of these techniques which is the full  spectrum fitting , as further outlined in section [ section : analysis ] .",
    "@xcite found that a measurement of @xmath6 within a 3% accuracy would be viable from a large redshift program targeting lrgs , and explored optimal observational set ",
    "ups for the experiment using the southern african large telescope ( salt ) .",
    "the potential to obtain wide optical wavelength coverage and high  resolution spectra from a 10meter  class telescope like salt provides an excellent opportunity to explore the potential of the cc method . in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of several observations which use the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss ) on salt to obtain 16 spectra of massive lrgs at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : we first describe the lrg sample selection from the 2df  sdss lrgs catalogue ( section [ section : selectionandreduction ] ) .",
    "we then describe the data reduction and some details about the method adopted to estimate the ages of these galaxies ( section [ section : selectionandreduction ] and [ section : analysis ] ) . in section [ section : hz ] we discuss the derived ages and estimate @xmath17 .",
    "our targets are lrgs from 2df  sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) catalogue . ]",
    "@xcite where their spectroscopic redshifts are already available , and from megaz ",
    "lrg photometric redshift catalogue @xcite",
    ". those galaxies must be visible with salt , massive , without emission lines , the brightest and the reddest in the catalogue .",
    "detailed description on each criterion is described below .",
    "many galaxies meet the selection criteria , but for a pilot survey , only few galaxies including those 16 galaxies listed in table [ tab : tabchar ] were aligned for the observations .",
    "we estimated the stellar masses of lrgs using the method outlined below , requiring potential targets to have stellar masses larger than @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "we also required targets to have redshifts within 0.01 of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and to have magnitude @xmath22 .",
    "we derived the stellar masses of lrgs in 2slaq by first cross  matching the catalogue with the _ _ wise _ _ data and detected 13518 sources in at least two of the four mid  infrared bands centered at 3.4 @xmath23 m ( w1 ) and 4.6 @xmath23 m ( w2 ) .",
    "the details on cross  matching the catalogue are provided in appendix [ appendix : sedfitting ] .",
    "the use of the _ wise _ data helped us to achieve our goal of selecting most massive lrgs which have typically formed at high redshifts .",
    "moreover , the combination of sdss and _ wise _ photometry has been investigated to produce a new technique to target lrgs at high redshift ( @xmath9 0.6 ) .",
    "we then combined the optical and mid  infrared flux densities to build the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these detected sources .",
    "next , we performed sed fitting with cigale @xcite .",
    "details of the mechanisms of cigale can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopted basic input parameters as suggested by the code developer ( giovannoli , private communication ) to extract the derived stellar mass of each galaxy given in table [ tab : tabchar ] .",
    "appendix [ appendix : sedfitting ] provides the details on how we processed the sed fitting by using our combined @xmath24 photometry plus _ wise _ 3.4 @xmath23 m and 4.6 @xmath23 m fluxes .",
    "the sed fitting was used to obtain only stellar masses of our galaxies , whereas the stellar population fits to the salt spectra using full  spectrum fitting over our entire wavelength range were used to derive the galaxy ages ( see section [ section : analysis ] ) . and those derived masses were then used to select our sample .",
    "we further constrained the selection criteria by requiring that targets should show no optical emission lines by visual inspection .",
    "we also included sdss j013403.82 + 004358.8 in our sample .",
    "this target was selected from the megaz ",
    "lrg photometric redshift catalogue @xcite , and it has been spectroscopically confirmed as a central cluster galaxy of a very rich cluster @xcite .",
    "the mass of this object was derived by fitting only its model @xmath25 fluxes .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of this sample were carried out with the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at salt .",
    "long  slit optical spectra of the sample were obtained between december 2011 and september 2012 under proposal codes 2011 - 3-rsa_oth-026 and 2012 - 1-rsa_oth-013 ( pi : a. ratsimbazafy ) .",
    "the observation was made using the pg0900 grating at two different grating angles to cover the @xmath26 4000  6000  range ( rest  frame wavelength range ) at both redshifts with a spectral resolution of @xmath26 46  .",
    "the log of observations is given in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "a slit width of 1 `` , yielding a resolution of @xmath27 , was used during the 2011 observations ; this was increased to a slit width of 1.5 '' that yielded a resolution of @xmath28 during the second semester of 2012 observations .    for wavelength calibration , spectra of a neon arc lamp",
    "were taken after each observation , as well as flat ",
    "field images in order to perform a standard reduction of two  dimensional long  slit spectra .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars were observed for flux calibration .",
    "for all observations , fidelity checking and basic calibrations such as the overscan , gain , cross  talk corrections and mosaicking were already performed by the automated salt pyraf pipeline called pysalt @xcite .",
    "further reduction was performed by following the standard long  slit data reduction technique with iraf .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from the two  dimensional spectrum using the lacosmic ( laplacian cosmic ray identification ) software @xcite .",
    "the two  dimensional science , flat field and arc images were trimmed to exclude nonuseful areas before performing the rest of the reduction .",
    "the two ccd gaps were filled with interpolated pixel values .",
    "all the spectra were flat  fielded by using calibrating flat ",
    "fields obtained for the science frames .",
    "this process helps to correct for the differences in sensitivity across the field and between detector pixels .",
    "the flat fields were also used to remove fringing at the far  red portion of the ccd chips .    the long package from iraf",
    "was then used for the wavelength calibration , extracting the spectrum , and subtracting the night sky spectrum .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were reduced according to the same procedure , and a relative flux calibration was applied to the science spectrum to recover the spectral shape . due to the nature of the salt telescope , the unfilled entrance pupil of the telescope moves during the observation and an absolute flux calibration",
    "is not possible .",
    "we combined the individual frames to create a master science image as well as an error image .",
    "this procedure was done before extracting the one  dimensional spectra .",
