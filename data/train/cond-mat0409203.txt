    "the veins of gems and ores are often the product of a multiple intrusion of a reacting fluid into a porous soil in which dissolution and subsequent re - crystallization processes are the determining factor .",
    "some examples like porphyry copper deposits @xcite or olivine @xcite have been studied in the literature and it is known that the surviving network of ore deposits has a fractal structure @xcite that can be exploited for mineral exploration @xcite .",
    "a similar situation can be found in vulcanology when magma is repeatedly injected through the same pathway , each time melting up again the most recent formations to find its way out @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the pore structure after several invasion - frost - thaw events has been investigated numerically @xcite , and results indicate that the fractal dimension of invasion clusters varies with the number of invasion cycles . in this work ,",
    "after invasion takes place , the structure of the porous pathway is randomly healed . in a similar approach @xcite , an optimized version of the multiple invasion percolation model was studied .",
    "some topological aspects as the acceptance profile and the coordination number were investigated and compared to those of ordinary invasion percolation .    in the cases mentioned @xcite above and also in other cases of repeated invasions of corroding , dissolving or melting fluids into a strongly heterogeneous substrate , slowly consolidating matrix fractal patterns",
    "are created that reflect the history of the material .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to develop a model of multiple invasion in order to simulate how these patterns form and how their fractal dimension changes .",
    "in fact , we propose a complete theoretical framework based on scaling laws @xcite .",
    "the theory of avalanche dynamics has been studied in a variety of contexts , for example in growth models , interface depinning and invasion percolation @xcite .",
    "the formation of fractal structures , diffusion with anomalous hurst exponents and lvy flights , can all be related to the same underlying avalanche dynamics @xcite . normally , the presence of avalanches in the invasion process supposes unchanged porous media . in this work",
    "we also investigate the mass - distribution of avalanches and determine how the exponent that characterizes this distribution changes for different cycles of the invasion process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model to simulate the multiple invasion in consolidating medium . in sec .",
    "iii we show the results for the invaded cluster mass . the results and analysis of the numerical simulation for avalanche distribution",

    "iv . , while the conclusions are presented in sec . vi .",
    "in order to simulate the injection process we use the standard non - trapping invasion percolation ( ntip ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the invaded solid is considered to be very heterogeneous and the invading fluid can potentially enter anywhere along the interface . here the consolidating medium is represented conveniently as a square network .",
    "the sites of the lattice can be viewed as the smallest units of constant strength and the randomness of the strength of the medium is incorporated by assigning random numbers to sites . for simplicity , we consider the case in which dissolutions control the fluid invasion .    on our heterogeneous medium",
    "we start by applying the standard invasion process of ntip . for completeness",
    "the algorithm is described as follows .",
    "initially , let us assign a random number , @xmath9 drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath10 $ ] , to each site @xmath11 of the lattice .",
    "we choose one site in the center of the lattice and occupy it .",
    "this site represents the injection point of the fluid and is the seed of the invading cluster .",
    "we look among the neighboring sites of this cluster ( the growth sites ) and choose the one which carries the smallest random number .",
    "this site is then invaded and added to the cluster .",
    "then we increase the list of sites that are eligible to be invaded . at each step of the invasion process , the perimeter of the nearest neighbors of the sites that form the invading cluster is investigated and the site that has the smallest @xmath12 is chosen .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the edge of the lattice is reached . at this point",
    "the simulation stops and the mass @xmath1 ( i.e. , the number of sites belonging to the invaded cluster ) of the cluster is computed .",
    "the number of sites of the invaded cluster is very often considered as a _ time _",
    "parameter .     lattice , for @xmath13 .",
    "the injection point is localized in the center of the lattice . in figures",
    "we show the results for @xmath14 and @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   lattice , for @xmath13 .",
    "the injection point is localized in the center of the lattice . in figures",
    "we show the results for @xmath14 and @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    now we present the new feature introduced to the standard invasion percolation . after we finish the above described simulation in agreement with customary ntip , the simulation is performed again starting every time at the same injection point .",
    "new random numbers chosen from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath10 $ ] are assigned to all sites belonging to the previously invaded cluster before a new invasion process starts . to all other sites , i.e. , namely , those that are outside the cluster , we assign a random number homogeneously distributed in the interval @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is a number close to unity .",
    "compared to the support used in the first generation where all sites can be invaded , the second generation appears substantially reduced , because it mostly corresponds to the cluster invaded in the first generation . in this way we generate again an invasion cluster for which @xmath13 is a subset of the previous one and so necessarily smaller .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath0 times , where @xmath0 is the number of generations .",
