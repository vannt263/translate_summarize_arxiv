    "despite continued progress in algorithms and hardware , the inclusion of dynamical fermions in lattice gauge calculations continues to incur significant computational expense . to motivate our proposal for a novel fermion algorithm",
    ", we briefly review how dynamical fermions are currently addressed . recall that dynamic fermions coupled to a gauge field on a @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice for @xmath3 are governed by an action of the form @xmath4=s_{g}[g_{e}]+s_{f}[g_{e},\\psi_{v},\\overline{\\psi_{v } } ] , \\label{eq : fullaction}\\ ] ] where the @xmath5 are valued in the gauge group @xmath6 at the edges of the lattice and @xmath7 are the fermion fields defined at the vertices of the lattice .    unlike gauge group variables , it is not practical to directly simulate grassmann variables on the computer .",
    "a common approach to dynamical fermion simulation starts by integrating out the fermion variables appearing in @xmath8 $ ] , to give a function of the gauge variables known as the fermion determinant ( its specific form is reviewed in section 2 ) .",
    "the fermion determinant can be combined with the kinetic part of the gauge boson amplitude @xmath9}$ ] to give an effective action for the gauge variables from which simulations on a computer can in principle proceed .",
    "however , the fermion determinant renders this effective action non - local   it couples together gauge variables that are arbitrarily distant in the lattice .",
    "this poses a considerable problem for the simulation , since computing the change in the effective action due to a small change in any variable becomes very expensive , growing prohibitively with increasing lattice volume .",
    "a variety of algorithms have been devised to work with the fermion determinant ; a description of some of the methods commonly employed can be found for example in @xcite .    after reviewing the description of single component , staggered free fermions in terms of self - avoiding polymers ( as was done for example in  @xcite ) , we review what happens when a similar procedure is applied to multi - component fermion fields minimally coupled to gauge fields . in this case",
    "each polymer configuration corresponds to a wilson loop functional ;",
    "i.e. the trace of a product of representation matrices around the polymer . because there is more than one component of the fermion fields in the non - abelian coupled case , the strict self - avoiding constraint of the single component case is weakened",
    "; that is , for an @xmath10-component fermion , up to @xmath10 directed polymer lines can enter and leave a given vertex .",
    "the picture has long been known  it is essentially that of a hopping parameter expansion of the fermion determinant , described for example in  @xcite . unlike",
    "many past applications , in the present case no cut - off in the power of the hopping parameter or otherwise is applied . because we seek an exactly dual model , all polymers",
    "are included in the configurations considered .    for each polymer diagram that arises in the free case , upon applying the duality transformation for the group - valued field",
    "the result is a sum of configurations consisting of all closed , branched , colored surfaces ( spin foams ) with open one - dimensional boundaries defined by the polymer diagram .",
    "the totality of spin foams associated with all polymer diagrams ( including the trivial empty polymer ) defines the joint configuration space .",
    "crucially , local changes to the dual configurations ( either polymer or surface structure ) lead to local changes in the dual amplitude .    the two theoretical inputs for this construction , a polymer decomposition of the fermion determinant ( i.e. hopping parameter expansion as described in  @xcite ) and a dual non - abelian model ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , have been present in the literature for some time , and as we shall see the construction of the joint dual model at the formal level is a rather straightforward synthesis of these constituent models . however , unlike ( the simplest implementations of ) conventional lattice gauge simulations , finding _ any _ practical algorithm for a dual model has proven somewhat non - trivial in the non - abelian case for dimensions greater than two .",
    "the algorithm proposed here builds upon the dual non - abelian algorithm of @xcite that has recently been tested in the pure yang - mills sector .",
    "in addition to pure spin foam moves , we construct a set of moves that act on polymer structure and specify the type of vertex amplitudes that arise due to the charges carried by the polymer . currently , an implementation of this algorithm is being tested and will be reported on in a forthcoming work .    for context",
    ", it should be noted that a similar picture was present in the work of aroca et al .",
    "@xcite and fort  @xcite , which dealt with the abelian case of @xmath11 and proposed using a hamiltonian that leads to a different lagrangian formulation , where the ensemble is built from a restricted subset of the configurations that arise in the kogut - susskind case . in future work",
    ", we believe the non - abelian generalization of  @xcite may be a very interesting alternative to the kogut - susskind formulation used here , particularly if the imbalance between negative and positive amplitudes and the reduction of species doubling described in  @xcite can be carried over to the non - abelian case .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we review the origin of the fermion determinant and discuss its expansion in terms of polymers . in section  3",
    ", we briefly review the dual computational framework for non - abelian , pure yang - mills theory on the lattice . in section  4 , we show a natural way to to combine these frameworks and formulate ergodic moves for the coupled fermion - boson system . in section  5 , we offer some conclusions and describe our program for ongoing numerical work based on this algorithm and its extensions .",
    "appendix  a describes the vertex amplitudes that arise in the joint case , while appendix  b expands on section  2 to describe the trace structure of polymers with multiply occupied vertices .",
    "in this section , we start from a conventional lattice discretization of free fermions , following in essentials and notation . in the usual manner ,",
    "the fermion determinant is arrived at by exact integration of the grassmann variables . following @xcite , the fermion determinant is then expanded into states ,",
    "each of which is represented by a family of _ disjoint , closed oriented loops _ , including trivial and degenerate `` loops '' , the _ monomers _ and _ dimers _ , respectively . a typical polymer configuration ( in the @xmath12 massive case )",
    "is illustrated   we now review explicitly how the fermion determinant and polymer picture come about .",
    "note this section is purely for pedagogical purposes and to fix notation to be used later ; those familiar with the hopping parameter expansion of the fermion determinant can safely skip it .          to illustrate the concept and introduce terminology , we treat a single species of fermions with no additional indices.we start with the naieve lattice field action for free staggered fermions @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the ( euclidean ) dirac matrices and @xmath15 is the set of lattice vertices .    using the central difference for the partial derivative ,",
    "this becomes @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the dimension of the hyper - cubic lattice , @xmath17 is the mass , @xmath18 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath19 labels one of the @xmath2 directions of the lattice ; @xmath20 is the unit lattice vector associated to the @xmath19th direction .",
    "following , we change to a basis which diagonalizes the gamma matrices , rewriting the free action as @xmath21 with @xmath22 for @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the components of the lattice site four - vector and @xmath25 .",
    "the edge dependent sign factor @xmath26 arises from the chosen diagonalization .    to express the result of integration over the grassmann variables it is convenient to introduce the _ quark matrix _ @xmath27 , defined in terms of lattice regularized action as @xmath28=\\sum_{x",
    ", y\\in v}\\overline{\\psi}_{y}q[g_{e}]_{yx}\\psi_{x}. \\label{eq : qmatrix}\\ ] ] for later reference , we include dependence on the gauge degrees of freedom in our definition of @xmath27 .",
    "we next apply the well known result that the grassmann integral over the fermion fields at every vertex evaluates to @xmath29}=\\int\\left(\\prod_{v\\in v}d\\psi_{v}d\\overline{\\psi}_{v}\\right ) e^{{-\\sum}_{x , y\\in v}\\overline{\\psi}_{y}q[g_{e}]_{yx}\\psi_{x}}=\\det q[g_{e } ] , \\label{eq : detidentity}\\ ] ] the determinant of the quark matrix .",
    "next we recall the continuum form of the action for massive fermions coupled to a gauge field . in the massive case",
    ", the quark matrix can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fermion mass and @xmath32 is the _ hopping matrix _ that is non - zero for nearest neighbor pairs @xmath33 . by inspection of ( [ eq : freefermiondiag2 ] )",
    ", we write the quark matrix as @xmath34 we now apply a well known identity for the determinant of ( any ) matrix @xmath27 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 ranges over the set @xmath37 of all permutations of the indices of @xmath27 and @xmath38 is the sign of the permutation . in the case of the quark matrix @xmath27 ,",
    "the matrix indices being permuted correspond to vertices of the lattice .",
    "thus , one is led to consider the product @xmath39 for every permutation of lattice vertices .",
    "the next step is to recognize that every permutation @xmath36 can be decomposed into a composition of disjoint , non - trivial _ cyclic _ permutations @xmath40 , @xmath41 . for a matrix with all entries non - zero",
    ", these permutations may involve sets of vertices that are arbitrarily separated on the lattice .",
    "however , the quark matrices that arise in practice have a very specific structure ( originating in the lattice discretization from nearest neighbor approximations of the derivative operator ) ; the only non - zero matrix elements consist of nearest - neighbor pairs ( and in the massive case , on - diagonal ) .",
    "thus , the non - zero contributions can be analyzed as follows .",
    "a given permutation @xmath36 affects any vertex trivially ( the vertex is sent to itself ) or as part of a non - trivial cyclic permutation . in the massive case , vertices that are permuted trivially give _ monomer _ factors equal to the mass @xmath31 . in the massless case where diagonal entries vanish",
    ", any trivial permutation will lead to a vanishing contribution ; thus every vertex must participate in a cyclic permutation in the massless case .    for the non - trivial permutations , it is useful to distinguish two cases that a vertex may participate in . permutations that swap a pair of neighboring vertices are referred to as _ dimers _ ; all other non - trivial permutations consist of non - trivial loops of edges on the lattice ; we shall refer to these as _ cycles_. given these observations on the structure of @xmath27 , we can now write an expression for @xmath42 in more explicit detail as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the number of monomers .",
    "the product is over all directed edges @xmath45 that are part of a dimer or cycle of the permutation .      to couple fermions to the gauge fields ,",
    "the ordinary derivative is replaced by the covariant one , thereby introducing the gauge variables @xmath5 which act on the fermions through the matrices of the representation corresponding to the charge of the fermion . for specificity",
    ", we will consider fermions charged in the representation of @xmath6 labelled by @xmath46 .",
    "one can show   that the lattice action for staggered fermions coupled to the gauge field becomes @xmath47 in contrast to the ( simplified one component ) free case , there is in general a vector possessing multiple grassmann variable components at each vertex , and matrices @xmath48 that act non - trivially on this vector . in terms of our permutation expansion , the quark matrix now takes on component as well as vertex labels as follows : @xmath28=\\sum_{x , y\\in v}\\overline{\\psi}_{y}^jq[g_{e}]_{yx}^{ji}\\psi_{x}^i .",
    "\\label{eq : quarkmatrixmulti}\\ ] ] comparing  ( [ eq : quarkmatrixmulti ] ) to  ( [ eq : coupled ] ) we identify the multicomponent quark matrix as @xmath49= m\\delta_{yx}-k\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{d}\\alpha_{x\\mu } \\left ( ( u^{\\dagger}_{x\\mu})^{ij } \\delta_{y , x-\\hat{\\mu}}-(u_{x\\mu})^{ij}\\delta_{y-\\hat{\\mu},x}\\right).\\ ] ] the @xmath50 dependence is through the representation matrices @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is labelled in one of the two conventions introduced above . the determinant formula can again be applied ; upon doing so , the expansion into permutations takes on the form @xmath53=\\sum_{\\pi}\\text{sgn}(\\pi)\\prod_{x , i}q_{x\\pi_{v}(x , i)}^{i\\pi_{i}(x , i)}.\\ ] ] observe that the permutations @xmath36 now act on both vertex and component indices of @xmath27 ; the action of @xmath36 on indices and vertices can be separated into the maps @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . as in the free case ,",
    "the locality structure allows one to identify non - vanishing , polymer - like contributions . for @xmath36 where vertex index mapping is trivial , the only non - vanishing entries are those for which @xmath56 as the massive term is an inner product with no cross - terms .",
    "thus , the monomers contribute factors @xmath57 , where @xmath10 are the number of components of the fermion vectors .    as in the single - component case , for vertices that participate in non - trivial permutations ,",
    "one still has that only permutations which move @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a nearest neighbor are non - vanishing .",
    "however , due to the presence of multiple components to the fermion field , permutations can shift both components at a vertex simultaneously .",
    "configurations which involve non - trivial shifts of more than a single component ( multiply occupied vertex contributions ) are discussed in the appendix b. in the remainder of this section , we will restrict ourselves to the case where only a single component participates in the shift , to illustrate in a simple setting how the trace of a product of @xmath60 matrices comes about .    by inspection of  ( [ eq : coupled ] )",
    ", we see for a given nearest neighbor vertex shift , _ all possible permutations of indices are allowed _ , since in the general case @xmath61 has all non - vanishing entries . to continue our analysis",
    "we factor the permutation into a part that acts on vertices @xmath55 ( these correspond to the dimers and cycles of the free case ) and a part that acts on component indices @xmath54 .",
    "we now write the fermion determinant as @xmath62=\\sum_{\\pi_v}\\text{sgn}(\\pi_v)\\sum_{\\pi_i}\\prod_xq_{x\\pi_v(x)}^{i\\pi_i(x , i)}+\\text{\\emph{(multiply occupied vertex contributions)}}.\\ ] ] focusing our attention on the first term , we note that only one component per vertex is shifted in each of the products of the sum ( multiple component shifts at a vertex are precisely what is included in the second term , discussed in appendix b ) . for a given @xmath55 , we can represent @xmath54 as an ordered sequence of arrows through the discrete @xmath10-point space living above every vertex acted on by @xmath55 ; see figure  [ fig : paths ] .    . ]",
    "note that for a given dimer or cycle @xmath55 , all possible index sequences correspond to permutations of the same order ( thus @xmath63 can be factored out ) .",
    "the final step in the analysis is to recognize that the sum over all paths is simply the trace of the matrix product of representation matrices around the cycle .",
    "we define @xmath64 as the restriction of @xmath65 $ ] to permutations involving singly occupied vertices ; that is , the first term of  ( [ eq : perms_vec2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath64 can be constructed out of loops with a single associated trace as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total number of edges where vertices are shifted in the permutation . in the second line ,",
    "the einstein summation convention for repeated indices is used . observe that @xmath45 denotes an oriented edge . depending on whether @xmath45 is along or opposing the canonical orientation",
    ", one has either a product of @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the visualization of a typical polymer configuration on a @xmath70 lattice ( including those with multiply occupied vertices ) appears in figure  [ fig : fermionvisual ] below .",
    "so far our discussion has been generic with regard to group , dimension , and fermion charge ; the only major choice has been staggered fermions rather than an alternative lattice discretization . in the remainder of this work ,",

    "polymers that appear to have open ends close on the opposite side of lattice due to periodic boundary conditions . ]",
    "having described what we shall refer to as the free ( no coupling to gauge fields ) fermion partition function in terms of closed lattice polymers , in this section we briefly review the dual formulation of pure ( no coupling to fermions ) yang - mills , which leads to closed , colored , branched lattice surfaces .",
    "we shall see in the next section that these pictures naturally combine to give the full interacting partition function in terms of a space of coupled configurations .",
    "it can be shown ( see for example  @xcite , and  @xcite for detail on @xmath71 in three dimensions ) that starting from the lattice discretized action for pure yang - mills @xmath72 one can transform to a spin foam formulation expressing the partition function in terms of dual variables as follows : @xmath73 here @xmath15 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denotes the vertices , edges , and plaquettes of the lattice , respectively .",
    "the summations over @xmath76 and @xmath77 range over all possible edge and plaquette labellings , respectively .",

    "next , we recall the form of the character expansion ( see  @xcite and references therein ) for the amplitude based on the heat kernel action at a plaquette @xmath87 , @xmath88 substituting the character expansion into the previous equation , we have @xmath89 where an overall constant factor of @xmath90 per plaquette has been discarded .",
    "we show in appendix a that the group integrals over products of traces and characters in each term of the character expansion can be evaluated exactly in terms of charged 18j symbols , provided a sum over intertwiner labels is made at each edge . using the vertex and edge amplitudes of appendix a , we can exhibit the joint dual partition function as @xmath91 where @xmath92 combines the two sign factors and a product of @xmath31 and @xmath86 factors . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "joint configurations associated to a polymer @xmath93 carry in general three rather than a single intertwiner label @xmath94 for each edge belonging to the polymer ; @xmath76 here ranges over all the intertwiner labels .",
    "although the overall dual amplitude is still a product of local amplitudes as in the pure yang - mills case , the presence of the wilson loop functionals associated to non - trivial polymers requires the vacuum vertex and edge amplitudes to be modified in a way that we define in appendix  a ; the result is a product of modified @xmath95 symbols and edge amplitudes @xmath96 that are charged according to the polymer content @xmath93 of the configuration .",

    "this is necessary to preserve detailed balance .",
    "if the move is not rejected , the spin of the selected plaquette is randomly decreased or increased by @xmath46 to satisfy parity . because a change in the polymer occupancy forces a change in both the plaquette spin and the charge structure at an edge , the affected intertwiner labels ( at each edge of the affected plaquette ) must change in a way that is compatible ; if not the result will be immediately @xmath46-edge inadmissible for the new charging .",
    "this is the most fundamental polymer - changing move , and connects a very large region of the space of polymers contributing to the fermion determinant .",

    "figure  [ fig : pmoves ] illustrates how the plaquette move can deform an existing cycle .",
    "the same plaquette move of opposite orientation would lead to one of multiple routings with a doubly occupied edge , as shown by figure  [ fig : pchoices ] in appendix  b.    because an equally weighted routing choice is made amongst several alternatives when the plaquette move of ( for example ) figure  [ fig : pchoices ] is made , the move that reverses a particular routing to get the initial loop back should occur with proportional probability , in order to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "this will unfortunately lead to a lowered acceptance rate , particularly in regimes with high occupancy .    to identify intertwiner moves compatible with a plaquette move",
    ", one must give the choice of splitting ( grouping of @xmath128 into pairs ) around the edges of a plaquette , in the same way that intertwiner moves compatible with a cube move depends on the splitting ( see a.3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "for conciseness and generality , we have made the present definition of the algorithm splitting independent .",
    "forthcoming work on numerical simulations with this algorithm will evaluate alternative splittings and describe the appropriate compatible moves .",
    "for integer valued charge @xmath46 , a global circle moves adds a single line of charge and a minimal cylinder of @xmath129 charged plaquette spins spanning the lattice . the origin and orientation of the cylinder is randomly selected to lie on a plaquette of one of three orthogonal lattice planes through the origin .    for half - integer @xmath46 ,",
    "two lines of charge spanning the lattice are added and a minimal surface consisting of a line of @xmath46-charged plaquettes is added between the charge lines .",
    "the position and orientation of the sheet is randomly selected to lie on an edge of one of the three orthogonal lattice planes through the origin .",
    "as in the pure gauge theory case , the non - trivial global topology of lattices with periodic boundary conditions leads one to moves that create and destroy structure on a global scale , in this case lines of charge .    in the half - unit charge case , a second line needs to be added to absorb the flux introduced by the first ; the `` smallest '' possible global move places a second line of half - unit charge immediately beside the first .    in the case of integer valued charge , the lowest energy ( and hence smallest change in amplitude ) structure satisfying admissibility",
    "is formed by wrapping the smallest possible cylinder supported by the lattice ; because there are @xmath130 fundamental irreps , @xmath10 can be incident on one side normal to the line , wrap into a cylinder , and enter the other to satisfy @xmath46-edge admissibility .",
    "an edge is randomly selected and a single unit of occupancy is added or removed . if the result is not consistent with the presence of dimers and cycle edges ( i.e. a cycle that ran through the edge is broken by the removal of occupancy ) , the move is rejected .",
    "singly and doubly charged dimers can not be constructed by plaquette moves .",
    "note a singly charged dimer contributes @xmath131 with weight @xmath132 while a doubly charged dimer contributes @xmath133 with weight @xmath134 ( unlike general polymers , we combine the two routings into one configuration ) .",
    "both types of dimers evaluate to constants with respect to the gauge variables , and thus do nt couple to the gauge bosons .    a vertex is randomly selected , and if multiply occupied , the routing of flux is changed .",
    "a multiply occupied vertex in the case of a 2-component fermion field has two flux paths , which can be routed in two different ways .",
    "when a multiply occupied vertex first appears as a result of a polymer move , one routing is randomly selected ( similarly in the inverse case , with weightings to preserve detailed balance as discussed above ) .",
    "thus , the junction moves are stricly speaking unnecessary for ergodicity , but may be used to improve performance of metropolis algorithm .      combining the polymer and spin foam moves , given",
    ", we give a statement for a metropolis algorithm ergodic on the joint ensemble .",
    "( joint fermion - boson algorithm ) .",
    "_ an iteration of the joint algorithm consists of choosing one of the seven previously defined moves , which can be organized as as follows : _        the algorithm can be tuned to improve acceptance rate by adjusting the relative frequency of the attempted move types .",
    "the algorithm also tracks the sign of the configuration changes with the creation and destruction of fermion loops , which can occur with any of the polymer moves .",
    "the product of monomer factors @xmath31 and hopping factors @xmath86 are also updated for polymer moves .",
    "it is important to emphasize that changes in both the sign and other factors require only local consideration of the polymer moves .    with regard to locality",
    ", one sees that the ( pure spin foam ) homology move and global circle moves will lead to updates costing on the order of @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively , where @xmath136 is a characteristic side length of the lattice . in the pure yang - mills case analyzed numerically in  @xcite ,",
    "the homology moves have negligible influence beyond very small lattice sizes .",
    "it remains to be seen how this is modified in the joint case , and how large an influence the global circle moves have .    within the scope of the current work ,",
    "the expectation values of observables depending on dual degrees of freedom are computed in the usual manner , by averaging the observable over the markov chain generated by the metropolis algorithm . for wilson loop type",
    "observables commonly studied , the expectation value is actually a ratio of dual charged and dual vacuum partition functions , with static charge corresponding to the wilson loop observable present in the charged partition function and a vacuum partition function given by @xmath137 of equation  ( [ eq : jointpartfunc ] ) .",
    "the computation of wilson loop observables of pure yang - mills and dynamical fermions will be reported on in forthcoming work by the author .",
    "we present here a local , exact algorithm for metropolis simulation of the fermion - boson vacuum .",
    "the details have been provided for the case of @xmath70 staggered kogut - susskind fermions coupled to a yang - mills @xmath0 field ; however the algorithm has a straightforward generalization to other dimensions and gauge groups .",
    "a limitation of the algorithm as currently given is the species doubling inherent in the ( unrooted ) kogut - susskind formulation ( e.g. in four dimensions there will be four species ) .",
    "an alternative to kogut - susskind fermions which addresses species doubling was developed by aroca et al .",
    "@xcite and fort  @xcite .",
    "we are currently investigating this modified fermion action in the non - abelian , higher dimensional context .",
    "another approach would be to go through a similar procedure using wilson fermions , in which the unwanted doublers become very heavy in the continuum limit .",
    "the crucial question for any new fermion algorithm is its performance relative to the highly evolved dynamic fermion methods that exist within the conventional lattice gauge community today . in three - dimensions ,",
    "slow - down at weaker coupling has been observed in recent work on the pure yang - mills case  @xcite .",
    "the situation in @xmath138 is not well understood and is currently the subject of numerical work by the author , as are improvements in the original @xmath70 case .    with regard to the continuum limit",
    ", we expect the most critical question for the algorithm proposed here is the seriousness of the sign problem .",
    "a hard sign problem has been discussed as a general feature of the polymer expansion in the continuum ( small mass ) limit  @xcite .",
    "while oscillating signs can be overcome for lattice fermions in certain two dimensional theories  @xcite , the author is not aware of methods that have successfully addressed the sign problem for @xmath139 . as both the fermion and dual yang - mills ( spin foam ) amplitudes can carry negative signs ,",
    "an important question is how the signs interact ; i.e. the problem of signs may be harder or easier than for either the free fermion polymer expansion or dual yang - mills alone , depending on how the signs correlate .    although numerical developments are required to begin evaluating this proposal , we believe the approach may be of considerable interest .",
    "we find it remarkable that the fermion expansion into polymers and the gauge field dualization into spin foams ( both of which have been extensively explored on there own ) , combine together in a way that is very compelling geometrically , and allows a local , exact metropolis simulation using gauge - invariant configurations carrying entirely discrete labels .",

    "however , the same undesired terms occur with opposite sign in the two diagrams ( as one involves paths that form a single loop , the other paths that lie in two disjoint loops ) so the sum of both captures the sum of permutations associated with the polymer .",
