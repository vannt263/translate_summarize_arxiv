    "universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf s ) are one of the most meaningful manifestations of the quantum - interference electron transport in mesoscopic and nanoscale systems .",
    "@xcite in weakly disordered miniature metals and at low temperatures , the  aperiodic \" ucf patterns are highly reproducible .",
    "those fluctuation patterns are determined by the specific impurity configuration that is  frozen \" in a given sample at a given cooldown .",
    "@xcite under such conditions , one may sweep a magnetic field @xcite or gate voltage @xcite sufficiently widely to realize statistically distinct subsystems ( independent members ) of the specific ensemble which embraces the given sample under study .",
    "the sample may then be thermally cycled up to room temperatures to induce possible rearrangement of the impurity configuration .",
    "if an impurity / disorder reconfiguration should occur , the ucf patterns would significantly or completely alter after the sample is remeasured at low @xmath6 . in this context , the impurities and defects are essentially _ static _ both in space and with time at liquid - helium temperatures .",
    "apart from the mesoscopic metal and semiconductor structures that are fabricated by the top - down electron - beam lithography , @xcite the ucf s have recently been studied in bottom - up artificially synthesized nanowires ( nw s ) .",
    "@xcite besides , the ucf s have been searched in newly developed materials , such as epitaxial ferromagnets , @xcite carbon nanotubes , @xcite graphene , @xcite and topological insulators .",
    "@xcite    tin - doped indium oxide ( in@xmath7sn@xmath8o@xmath9 , or so - called ito ) is a metal oxide which exhibits low electrical resistivities @xmath10 ( @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 cm ) @xcite and , in particular , free - carrier - like electronic conduction properties , @xcite such as a linear diffusive thermopower in the wide @xmath6 interval 5300 k. @xcite single - crystalline ito nw s possess similar metallic characteristics to those of ito films .",
    "@xcite at not too low temperatures , the @xmath10@xmath6 behavior can be described by the standard boltzmann transport equation .",
    "below a few tens degree of k , the quantum - interference weak - localization ( wl ) and electron - electron interaction effects @xcite ( among other possible effects @xcite ) cause notable corrections to @xmath10 [ see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] . furthermore ,",
    "in _ sufficiently short _ ito nw s , pronounced ucf s can arise at cryogenic temperatures , owing to the absence of classical self - averaging in the sample conductance @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite in this work , we report our experimental results for three ito nw s that reveal marked ucf s in sweeping , perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "two of our nw s had been intentionally thermally cycled to 300 k and then remeasured at liquid - helium temperatures .",
    "the shape of the ucf patterns completely altered due to the impurity / disorder reconfigurations induced by the room - temperature thermal energy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant . in sharp contrast , the ucf magnitudes remained basically unchanged .",
    "our measured @xmath6 dependence of the root - mean - square ( rms ) ucf magnitudes , however , can not be described by the existing theory .",
    "the reason why seems to be associated with the concept of  thermal averaging \" that is brought forward in the current mesoscopic theory .",
    "@xcite under the condition of @xmath17 ( which is pertinent to the present study , where @xmath18 is the normalized planck s constant , and @xmath19 is the electron dephasing time ) , the canonical ucf theory predicts that the effect of the thermal averaging would lead to an extra @xmath20 temperature dependence of the conductance fluctuation magnitudes , in addition to that to result from the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath19 .",
    "unexpectedly , such a strong @xmath20 temperature dependence is not seen in this work .",
    "further experimental investigations focusing on the temperature characteristics of the ucf magnitudes would be useful to improve our understanding of this issue . in this",

    "we have observed universal conductance fluctuations with varying magnetic field in indium tin oxide nanowires from 0.26 k up to @xmath0 k. the ucf s originate from the inherent quantum - interference nature of the electron transport in weakly disordered nanoscale structures .",
    "we found that the shape of the ucf patterns is very sensitive to the specific impurity configuration , and it alters completely after thermal cycling the sample to room temperatures .",
    "the root - mean - square ucf magnitudes increase with reducing temperature , reaching a fraction of @xmath1 at @xmath2 k. however , the temperature dependence of our measured ucf magnitudes can not be explained by the existing theory .",
    "the discrepancy between the experiment and theory seems to arise from the absence of the thermal averaging effect in our measurements . in our experiment , we are always in the regime of @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath4 ( @xmath40 ) . under such conditions",

    "the reason why this does not happen such that @xmath46 does not lead to a notable temperature dependence of the measured ucf magnitudes is not understood . in this work ,",
    "the ucf magnitudes in every nanowire are deduced from averaging over about 20 to 40 correlation field @xmath47 periods for our applied magnetic field of 4 t. whether such averaging over a somewhat limited range of measuring magnetic field is fully equivalent to the theoretically concerned averaging over a complete change of the impurity configurations , i.e. , whether the ergodic hypothesis assumed in the original ucf theory @xcite is faithfully met in our measurements , deserves further investigations .",
    "finally , the approximate values of the electron dephasing length @xmath40 has been evaluated and found to be in reasonable semiquantitative agreement with the dephasing length @xmath5 extracted from the weak - localization magnetoresistance studies .",
