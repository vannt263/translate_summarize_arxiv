    "the daya bay experiment is located near the daya bay nuclear power plant , with six reactors , two at daya bay and four at ling ao .",
    "these reactors provide a total of 17.6 gw thermal power , producing one of the most intense reactor antineutrino fluxes available in the world .",
    "the daya bay experiment was designed to provide the most precise measurement of @xmath2 , and this has been achieved by a careful design of antineutrino detectors ( ads ) and baseline . prior to august 2012 daya bay",
    "had six functionally identical ads , and after august 2012 a total of eight functionally identical ads were installed .",
    "each ad was filled with a 20-ton gadolinium - doped liquid scintillating ( gd - ls ) target region .",
    "the ads were distributed among near and far experimental halls .",
    "the two near halls contained four ads ( two at each experimental hall ) and the far hall contained four ads .",
    "the ads were submerged in a water pool , with at least 2.5 m of high - purity water in all directions to shield against ambient radiation and for background tagging .",
    "full information about the daya bay ad system and site can be found in ref .  .",
    "antineutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) process , @xmath3 . to select ibd candidates a coincidence of the prompt signal @xmath4 and the delayed signal from neutron capture on gd is required .",
    "to achieve precise measurements characterization of detector response of each ad is essential .",
    "regular calibration runs are done using sources deployed by automated calibration units ( @xmath5ge , @xmath6co , @xmath7am@xmath8c ) .",
    "the difference in reconstructed energy between ads is less than 0.2@xmath9 in the energy range of the antineutrino flux .",
    "in addition characterization of the prompt signal requires precision on the absolute energy scale for @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . the absolute energy scale uncertainty , which is correlated among all ads , is constrained to be less than 1@xmath9 in the majority of the energy range of the antineutrino flux .",
    "more information on calibration and absolute energy scale can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the following section we discuss the analyses presented at the seventh meeting on cpt and lorentz symmetry ( cpt16 ) .",
    "during december 2011 until november 2013 a total of 1.1 million ( 150k ) ibd candidates were selected in the near ( far ) halls , representing the largest sample among all previous and current reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the efficiency between ads is 0.2@xmath9 .",
    "the largest source of background is accidental coincidence of singles events , which accounts for 2.3@xmath9 ( 1.4@xmath9 ) of the candidates in the far ( near ) hall .",
    "other sources of background are cosmogenic backgrounds , beta delayed - neutron emitters @xmath12li and @xmath13he , fast neutrons produced by untagged muons , and background due to @xmath14 , n ) nuclear reaction .",
    "all together these are less than 0.5@xmath9 of the candidates .",
    "the final estimation of signal and background rates , as well as the efficiencies of the muon veto and multiplicity selection are summarized in table i of ref .  .",
    "to estimate the oscillation parameters , the survival probability was measured using the l / e - dependent disappearance of @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy in mev of the @xmath15 , @xmath18 is the distance in meters from the @xmath15 production point , @xmath19 is the solar mixing angle , and @xmath20 is the mass - squared difference of the first two neutrino mass eigenstates in ev@xmath21 . with increased statistics , improvements in calibration , and improved background estimation , we were able to provide the most precise measurement to date of @xmath22 and sin@xmath0 .",
    "the best estimates were sin@xmath23 and @xmath24 ev@xmath21 .",
    "[ fig : osc ] shows regions in the @xmath25sin@xmath0 plane ( left ) and the electron antineutrino survival probability ( right ) .",
    "full details of the oscillation analysis can be found in ref .  .",
    "sin@xmath0 plane allowed at 68.3@xmath9 , 95.5@xmath9 and 99.7@xmath9 confidence levels by the near - far comparison of the @xmath15 rate and energy spectra ( left ) .",

    "the deficit in the detected number of antineutrinos at the far detectors relative to the expected number on the near detectors yielded sin@xmath0 = 0.071 @xmath27 0.011 in the three - neutrino - oscillation framework .",
    "this result is consistent with the gd measurement .",
    "full details of the hydrogen analysis can be found in ref .  .",
    "thanks to the large @xmath15 sample collected it is also possible to perform a precise measurement of the absolute reactor antineutrino flux .",
    "this analysis uses the 217-day dataset of the 6-ad period .",
    "the ratio of the daya bay measurement to the huber - mueller ( ref .  ) model prediction is r = 0.947 @xmath27 0.022 , while r = 0.992 @xmath27 0.023 when compared to the ill - vogel ( ref .  )",

    "a search for light sterile neutrino mixing was performed using the 6-ad period .",
    "the relative spectral distortion due to the disappearance of @xmath15 was found to be consistent with that of the three - flavor oscillation model .",
    "thus no evidence of sterile neutrinos was found .",
    "the derived limits on sin@xmath28 cover the @xmath29 ev@xmath21 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 0.1 ev@xmath21 region , which was largely unexplored .",
    "full details of this analysis can be found in ref .  .",
    "a physical system is said to have lorentz symmetry if the relevant laws of physics are unaffected by lorentz transformations .",
    "this yields a natural connection with cpt in the sense that certain theories ( local quantum field theories ) with lorentz symmetry must also have cpt symmetry like the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a generalization of the sm and general relativity that has all the conventional properties , but allows for lorentz - invariance ( li ) and cpt violation is called the standard - model extension ( sme ) ; see for instance ref .  .",
    "the sme provides a quantitative description of lorentz and cpt violation controlled by a set of coefficients whose values are to be determined or constrained by experiments .",
    "one of the consequences of introducing cpt / li violation is directional dependence in an event rate as function of sidereal time in a sun - centered system .",
    "this can be translated into new oscillation effects , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sm oscillation probability and the sidereal amplitudes @xmath35 depend on the directional factors and the cpt / li violation coefficients . see ref .   for more information .",
    "thanks to the daya bay design we are able to look at multiple beam directions from multiple baselines , and we can derive limits on individual cpt / li violation coefficients . with high statistics ( 621 days ) and reduced systematic errors we expect to produce a significantly improved result for cpt / li violation coefficients using antineutrinos from reactors ."
