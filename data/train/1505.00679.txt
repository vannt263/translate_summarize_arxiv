    "in recent years many experimental and theoretical progress in high - q electromagnetic cavities have been made . among them , there is a phenomenon that can be seen in the name of non - stationary casimir effect ( nsce ) or dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) caused by changes of ( vacuum ) quantum states of fields due to a fast time variations of positions ( or properties ) of boundaries confining the fields @xcite .",
    "the dce was invented by yablonovitch @xcite and schwinger @xcite for the first time .",
    "the dce has been observed in many systems such as : single mirror cavity @xcite , cavities with moving mirrors @xcite , circuits @xcite and parametrically excited media @xcite .",
    "amplification of quantum ( vacuum ) fluctuations in these macroscopic systems is a common feature . in cavity with moving mirrors ,",
    "dce concerns to the reconstruction of the quantum state of a field , due to a time dependent geometrical configuration .",
    "many phenomena @xcite such as photon creation @xcite , interaction between the field and detectors @xcite , generation of nonclassical ( in particular squeezed ) states @xcite , etc .",
    "are observed in these cavities .",
    "et al _ have investigated the photon creation in one - dimensional cavity in vacuum state ( empty cavity ) @xcite .",
    "+ sousa _ et al _ @xcite recently have shown that the nonlinear kerr effect can be observed in cavities with dce . in other words , a realistic description of cavity dce include the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "+ in other side , optomechanics as a new field has some common features with dce ( which has been observed in cavity with moving mirror ) . gong _",
    "et al _ , recently have showed that , the kerr nonlinear optical effect can be observed in optomechanical system in vacuum .",
    "so the cavity with moving mirror can be supposed as a kerr - like nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "+ there are many standard methods for generation and detection of non - classical , in particular squeezed , light . the squeezed light detection has been done in homodyne systems @xcite , which is a phase - sensitive measurement of the optical field quadratures .",
    "the squeezed light interaction with atomic systems has been predicted in refs . @xcite . while the most important advantage of cavity with moving wall ( optomechanical system ) is detection the quantum mechanical effects ( such as squeezing ) macroscopically .",
    "recently , some systems such as non - linear media @xcite and optomechanical systems @xcite and resonators with moving wall @xcite have been considered for generating squeezed light .",
    "but , in nonlinear media with optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , the squeezed parameters are affected by various experimental features @xcite .",
    "moreover nonlinear processes such as multiphoton absorption can change the photon statistics of the incident light and generate a narrower photon distribution than poisson distribution @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "multiphoton absorption processes are very sensitive to the type of light state and its fluctuations .",
    "the influence of nonclassical light fluctuations particularly the squeezed states on the two photon absorption has been studied and its absorption rate compared with respect to the phase and amplitude of the squeezed beam @xcite .",
    "the two photon interaction of atoms and squeezed light has been considered in refs .",
    "the effect of the absorption process on the squeezed light has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . and",
    "the two photons quantum optics has been investigated by @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "as well , the multiphoton absorption rate is calculated by quantum mechanical perturbation theory in a semi - classical approach .",
    "+ wilson _ et al _ @xcite in their paper has experimentally shown the effect of dce in superconducting circuit .",
    "they have mentioned that this system operates as a parametric amplifier ( nonlinear medium ) to generate photons , and the mechanism of generating photons is very similar to a nonlinear medium .",
    "+ in this contribution , as it has been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are going to present two different , but somehow related , approaches for detecting the nonclassical - squeezed - state of light . +",
    "both approaches concern the nonlinear effects , which are sensitive to different modes of incident field . in the first part of the paper",
    "the interaction of squeezed state and a 1d cavity with moving mirror will be investigated . in the second one the interaction of",
    "squeezed light with nonlinear media is studied .",
    "the outcomes of these two schemes will be compared with the situation , when the incident field is in a coherent state .",
    "the drastic difference between two setups ( squeezed and coherent states ) can be used for characterizing the detection of the nonclassical light .",
    "+ in the first step , we will study the photon generation rate in the one - dimensional cavity with moving wall ( in the principal mode ) , in which the incident field is in coherent or squeezed state .",
    "+ in the second step , by quantizing the electromagnetic field , we derive probability amplitude for three photon absorption in a nonlinear medium , by using quantum polarization @xcite .",
    "+ in sec.([sec2 ] ) , we review the pioneer work of dodonov and klimov in ref .",
    "@xcite , to summarize the related results for calculating the photon generation rate in a cavity with moving boundaries . in sec.([sec3 ] ) we derive photon generation rate in the cavity for two modes of light ( squeezed and coherent light ) .",
    "the results for two different modes are also plotted in a few diagrams .",
    "the fundamental concepts of interaction of these two modes and nonlinear media is explained in sec.([sec4 ] ) . in this section",
    "we obtain the rate of three photons absorption in a semi - classical approach and in sec.([sec5 ] ) , the problem of the last section is studied in full quantum mechanical approach . in sec.([sec6 ] ) we obtain the rate of absorption for two kinds of light and compare them .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec.([sec7 ] ) .",
    "in order the paper be self contained , we review in this section the related results given in @xcite .",
    "we consider a cavity having two infinite ideal plates , one being at rest at @xmath0 , and the other one moving according to a time dependent function l(t ) when @xmath1 .",
    "we consider an electromagnetic field whose vector potential is directed along z axis .",
    "the field operator in _ heisenberg representation _ at @xmath2 ( when both the plates were at rest ) is @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the annihilation photon operator and @xmath6 .",

    "the amount of photons created in the _ _ m__th mode equals the average value of the operator @xmath40 , since just this opretator has a physical meaning at @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the field in the cavity is initially in squeezed coherent state @xmath41 where the subscript @xmath42 indicates this state is defined with respect to the @xmath43 .",
    "the average of photon creation in mode @xmath44 is given by , @xmath45 by using the eq .",
    ", the above relation can be written in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 this expectation value can be calculated by using the squeezing operator according to the following relations @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is squeezing operator and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are squeezing parameter and its phase respectively . after some calculation eq .",

    "the sums in eq . can be simplified @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 therefore we obtain the final form of the generation rate , @xmath59      now we apply a driving field in coherent state , and follow the same procedure as given in the above subsection in order to calculate the photon generation rate.the field is considered to be in the coherent state @xmath60 , where the subscript @xmath61 indicates that these states are eigenvectors of the annihilation operator @xmath43 . the photon number created in the _ _ m__th mode is given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 and as we have just now noted , @xmath64 where the expansion in terms of fock states is well known , latexmath:[\\ ] ] if we transform the expectation value in eqs . and according to the eq . and inserting eqs .",
    "- into these equations , @xmath188 and @xmath189 by replacing these results into eq . , the final form can be obtained .",
    "now , we consider some assumptions for description the three photon absorption process .",
    "the states @xmath190 and @xmath132 are the virtual states , so their populations are vanishes . in the three photon absorption , in fig [ pz4 ] , we assume the involved frequencies are the same , so that , @xmath191 so @xmath192 and @xmath193 . on the other hand",
    "the virtuale states are nearly coincident with one of the resonant real level .",
    "therefore we consider @xmath194 . for simplicity",
    "the decay rate of states has been considered as the same to each other as @xmath195 . according to this assumption , @xmath196 according to eqs .",
    "and one obtains , @xmath197 inserting the above equations into the eq .",
    ", the suitable form for expectation value will be achieved , @xmath198 here @xmath199 . using eq . and",
    ", one obtains the rate of three photon absorption in quantum approach , @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the density of final state and lorentzian shape is a well - known example of it and its derivation is given in appendix b. in quantum approach the electric field has the form as @xmath202 and the negative part defined as @xmath203 .",
    "therefore the form of the absorption rate in quantum and semi - classical approaches is the same ( see the eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) ) . by considering eq .",
    "one can obtain the expectation value @xmath204 for coherent and squeezed state . the normalized rate of the third order absorption for squeezed and coherent lights with the same intensity ,",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ p5 ] , where @xmath205 , @xmath206@xmath207 and different values of the squeezed parameter have been chosen .",

    "@xmath210 is related to the maximum value of squeezed light with @xmath208 = 1.5 ) .,title=\"fig:\"][p5 ]    this figure shows that nonlinear media are very sensitive to the state of light . when the incident light is in a quantum state ,",
    "specially squeezed one , the rate of absorption is several times greater than the case if the coherent light is applied . on the other hand",
    ", one can see obviously that for the same intensity , by increasing the squeezed parameter the difference of the rate absorption between coherent and squeezed light becomes very prominent .",
    "this important point is an indication for the accepted result , that the nonlinearity can be used for amplification of non - classicality . so that the proposed system can be considered as a detector for the squeezed state of radiation .",
    "investigating figures [ plot1 ] and [ p5 ] shows that the photon generation by a driving field in squeezed state , in 1d cavity with moving wall and three photon absorption in nonlinear medium , is several times greater than the case of coherent light .",
    "it seems that this phenomenon may be explained by considering that the noises in squeezed light , at least in one of its quadrature , is suppressed , and altogether the squeezed light shows more interaction power in nonlinear media .",
    "the main purposes of the paper are twofold .",
    "first , we have studied one - dimensional cavity with moving mirror in presence of squeezed and coherent light .",
    "the photon creation rate has shown an obvious difference between these two modes of light . the photon generation rate increased with increasing of squeezing parameter .",
    "second , by another approach , we have demonstrated that the nonlinear responses of the media is highly affected by the state of the interaction field .",
    "we have illustrated the third order of the photon absorption rate of squeezed light in comparison to the coherent case , dependent on the squeezing parameter , indicates drastic difference .",
    "as most important result , we conclude that the nonlinear effects in 1d cavity with moving mirror are comparable with a nonlinear medium , when they interact with different states of light . in other words ,",
    "the nonlinearity amplifies the non - classicality of states .",
    "we have seen the drastic difference between squeezed and coherent states of light , which can be used for detection the non - classicality of states .              according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the time dependence of the square of absolute value of the expectation value can be obtained , @xmath214 on the other hand , for large values of the time , one can prove , @xmath215 in real situation , the final state is not sharp in the frequency transition and make a continuous distribution in frequency domain .",
    "so the @xmath216 can be replaced by @xmath201 . usually , the @xmath201 has lorentzian shape including the decay term @xmath217 .",
    "so the absorption probability can be written in the form , @xmath218 using eq .",
