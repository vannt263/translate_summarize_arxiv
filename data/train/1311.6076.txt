    "these models can be regarded as _ fermion _ systems .",

    "the hall - littlewood polynomials have representations in terms of vertex operators , and many properties including the connection with the melting crystal model can be treated in the same way for the schur polynomials . however , there is no such vertex operator representation for the grothendieck polynomials , and we approach to the problem of construction by using the correspondence with the non - hermitian integrable models .",

    "<S> we study non - hermitian integrable fermion and boson systems from the perspectives of grothendieck polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> the models considered in this article are the five - vertex model as a fermion system and the non - hermitian phase model as a boson system . </S>",
    "<S> both of the models are characterized by the different solutions satisfying the same yang - baxter relation . from our previous works on the identification between the wavefunctions of the five - vertex model and grothendieck polynomials , we introduce skew grothendieck polynomials , and derive the addition theorem among them . using these relations , we derive the wavefunctions of the non - hermitian phase model as a determinant form which can also be expressed as the grothendieck polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we establish a @xmath0-theoretic boson - fermion correspondence at the level of wavefunctions . as a by - product , </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of the statistical mechanical model of a 3d melting crystal is exactly calculated by use of the scalar products of the wavefunctions of the phase model . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant expression can be regarded as a @xmath0-theoretic generalization of the macmahon function describing the generating function of the plane partitions , which interpolates the generating functions of two - dimensional and three - dimensional young diagrams . </S>"
