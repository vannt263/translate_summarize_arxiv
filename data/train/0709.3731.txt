    "the term running penumbral ( rp ) wave was created by @xcite to describe chromospheric h@xmath1 velocity and intensity fronts that were observed moving out through sunspot penumbrae . since then , a host of work has been carried out on reporting their properties ( see , e.g. , the series of papers by and ) , while their exact nature has remained unidentified . currently , the two most likely possibilities for the form of these oscillatory disturbances are :    1 .",
    "trans - sunspot waves generated in the umbra ( e.g. , by umbral flashes ) and limited to the chromospheric layer , 2 .   a `` visual pattern '' resulting from field - aligned waves propagating up from the photosphere .    to date",
    ", many findings point toward rp waves being due to the `` visual pattern '' scenario ( for an extensive discussion of this topic see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "this seems especially likely now that @xcite have successfully identified chromospheric 3-min umbral oscillations as propagating , field - aligned , acoustic waves .",
    "however , recent work by has not been able to decide between either of the two possible rp wave scenarios .",
    "thus , the sum of the evidence is still not conclusive .    in this paper",
    "we use velocity time series observations that possess a two - fold advantage over those of previous studies .",
    "the first is the simultaneous recording of photospheric and chromospheric lines , allowing the connection between velocities in the lower and upper atmosphere to be accurately investigated .",
    "the second is the retrieval of the magnetic vector at both heights in the atmosphere through the use of full - stokes spectropolarimetry , thus circumventing the need for any assumptions about the possible orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the dataset used here was obtained from the main spot of active region noaa 9451 on 2001 may 9 with the tenerife infrared polarimeter (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the german vacuum tower telescope in tenerife , canary islands . the 0.5@xmath240   spectrograph slit was positioned across noaa 9451 for approximately 70  min with no spatial scanning of the slit , while the solar image was kept stationary beneath the slit via a correlation tracking device .",
    "the main umbra from this dataset was previously analyzed and presented as dataset 2 in the work of @xcite , so only a brief description of the observational setup and format of the data is supplied here .",
    "note the correct heliographic coordinates of the observed sunspot are s22e20 .",
    "the spectral region obtained in these observations was recorded with a wavelength sampling of 31  m  pixel@xmath3 and includes the photospheric si10827.09    line , the upper - chromospheric he10830    multiplet ( with triplet components at 10829.09   , 10830.25   , and 10830.34   ) , and the telluric h@xmath4o line at 10832.11   .",
    "the instrument was used to record simultaneous spectral images of the four stokes parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) for each of the 0.4   spatial pixels along the slit .",
    "multiple images were coadded online to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , resulting in a final cadence of 2.1  s.    after dark current subtraction , flat - field correction , polarization calibration , and removal of polarization cross talk @xcite , stokes ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) profiles were inverted separately for each line using the milne - eddington inversion code of .",
    "for the he inversions an atmospheric model with one magnetic component was used , while a non - magnetic component was included in the si inversions to account for stray light . a continuum intensity space - time plot of the time series is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel ] , alongside absolute magnetic field strengths , line - of - sight ( los ) velocities , and magnetic field inclinations in solar coordinates ( see   [ subsubsec : atm_cou ] for more details ) retrieved by the si and he inversions .",
    "the si and he los velocities retrieved from the inversions both show systematically decreasing velocity ( i.e. , blueshift ) with time .",
    "this trend arises from the relative motion along the observer s los caused by the earth s rotation , as these observations were obtained during local morning .",
    "simple linear fits proved a suitable approximation to the trends and los velocity time series from each spatial pixel had these linear background trends removed prior to any form of temporal analysis .",
    "fourier phase difference analysis is a useful tool through which the propagation characteristics of waves may be determined .",
    "the form of analysis used here is based on the standard fourier equations that are discussed in depth by .",
    "this technique has been used extensively in the past for various solar studies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and it remains one of the most robust methodologies in use .    the phase difference spectrum , @xmath9 , between two temporal signals measures the phase lag at discrete frequencies .",
    "for signals separated by some spatial distance , this lag is the cycle - time that it takes different frequency components to travel from the first location to that of the second .",
    "when waves propagate between two locations in a normally dispersive medium , phase difference spectra will show zero phase difference at low frequencies ( where waves are evanescent and not propagating ) followed by phase differences which increase in magnitude at higher frequencies ( as high - frequency components travel more slowly than low - frequency components ) .    the fourier phase coherence spectrum , @xmath10 , between two signals is a measure of the quality of phase difference variation .",
    "however , unless averaging in frequency is performed , the coherence between two fourier components will be unity irrespective of the phase differences .",
    "the fourier squared coherence of randomly distributed phase differences then approaches 1/@xmath11 for averaging over @xmath11 points in frequency . in this",
    "work coherence values are calculated using an average over 5 frequency intervals , providing a `` noise '' level of 0.2 for randomly distributed ( i.e. , uncorrelated ) phase differences . in the following phase difference diagrams ,",
    "fourier squared coherence is represented by the degree of symbol shading ( white for 0 ; black for 1 ) while the symbol size represents the cross - spectral power  a measure of the co - variance between the si and he los velocity signals .",
    "if rp waves are due to waves propagating across the sunspot chromosphere , spectra calculated between the chromospheric los velocities from the umbra and those from pixels at sequentially greater distances into the penumbra should show phase difference values increasing linearly with frequency , becoming steeper with greater spatial separation of the signals . in this analysis",
    ", fourier phase differences and coherences were calculated between the he los velocity from pixel 55 ( located in the umbra ) and the he los velocities from pixels at increasing distances into the penumbra .",
    "figure  [ fig : fft_tra_sun ] shows the output from such an analysis , where phase difference spectra between the he los velocity from pixel 55 and those pixel numbers listed in each panel are overplotted .",
    "for example , panel _ a _ contains @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while panel _",
    "b _ contains @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the temporal he los velocity signal from spatial pixel @xmath17 .",
    "although groups of phase difference spectra are overplotted to increase the clarity of any relations , no clear form of propagating wave behaviour is seen .",
    "note that around 4  mhz ( i.e. , 4-min period ) values of increasing phase difference are observed when moving into the penumbra .",
    "however , the finding is marginal since the values of fourier squared coherence in the spectra rapidly approach the `` noise '' level of 0.2 for randomized phase differences .",
    "although a number of differing forms of propagating wave can exist in the outer atmosphere of a sunspot ( e.g. , fast / slow magneto - acoustic and alfvn waves ) we shall restrict our analysis of upward - propagating waves to that of field - aligned acoustic waves , as these were shown by @xcite to describe the phase behaviour of 3-min waves in sunspot umbrae .",
    "the extension of these waves from travelling along near - vertical field lines in the umbra to travelling along inclined field lines which expand out over the penumbra is not unexpected since :    1 .",
    "the magnetic field inclination increases smoothly from the umbral centre out through the penumbra ( figs .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel]_d _ and [ fig : con_b_vel]_g _ ) , 2 .",
    "the photospheric los velocity signals are fairly coherent across the umbra / penumbra boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel]_c _ ) .    to study the possible propagation of field - aligned waves between two atmospheric heights we must first accurately determine the photospheric pixels that provide the lower atmospheric signal for the chromospheric pixels which lie above the penumbra .",
    "this is necessary because the field is significantly inclined here ( figs .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel]_d _ and [ fig : con_b_vel]_g _ ) and velocity signals in the upper atmosphere will be spatially removed from their originating photospheric pixels . the expected picture for field - aligned , upward - propagating waves is indicated in the schematic diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , where increasingly inclined field lines at the photosphere reach further into the chromospheric penumbra .      in order to correctly pair spatial pixels between the photosphere and the chromosphere we require reliable determination of the magnetic field vector in solar coordinates .",
    "this is complicated by the 180  azimuthal ambiguity , whereby two equally valid but opposite azimuth orientations exist in the observer s coordinate frame .",
    "this uncertainty in the field azimuth impacts on the whole magnetic vector ; the two differing azimuthal solutions yield different solar inclinations , @xmath18 .    to overcome this ambiguity we have implemented a `` smoothest magnetic vector '' form of ambiguity solution .",
    "namely , a pixel region with the most realistic solution is selected as a trusted starting point ( e.g. , in the umbra where the true solution should be closest to vertical ) .",
    "moving away from this seed region , either the 0  or 180  azimuth solution is chosen on a pixel - by - pixel basis to minimise the spatial variation in the three orthogonal components of the solar magnetic vector ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , where the @xmath22-direction is normal to the solar surface .",
    "the field inclinations achieved in solar coordinates are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel]_d _ and [ fig : con_b_vel]_g _ for the inversion results from si and he , respectively .",
    "spatial pixels were then paired between the photosphere and chromosphere using the temporal averages of si inclinations in the solar coordinate frame , @xmath23 . coupled with an expected height separation , @xmath24 , these inclinations provide pixel offsets between photospheric and chromospheric pixel pairs in the direction along the slit by @xmath25 , where @xmath24 was taken as 1000  km ( following the findings of * ? ? ?",
    "* for this sunspot umbra ) , @xmath26 is the spatial sampling of the slit ( @xmath27@xmath28  kmpixel@xmath3 ) , and @xmath1 is the angle between the field azimuth and the slit direction . regions of pixels paired together in this work are outlined in panels _",
    "b_-_g _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : con_b_vel ] by dotted lines , while details of the pixel pairs are provided in table  [ tab : pixel_pairs ] with their corresponding field inclinations .",
    "although this approach uses the simplifying assumption that the magnetic field remains essentially linear between the two formation heights ( i.e. , there is no field curvature ) , it is somewhat justified by the resulting pixel pairs in table  [ tab : pixel_pairs ] having inclinations that differ by @xmath297   i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the fourier phase difference spectra resulting from these dual - height pixel pairs are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fft_upw_pro ] , where spectra from groups of adjacent pixel pairs are again overplotted to enhance any relations .",
    "in contrast to the trans - sunspot case depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fft_tra_sun ] , the expected form of phase difference variation due to propagation ( i.e. , increasing values of phase difference with frequency ) is clearly apparent in most of the panels .",
    "in addition , throughout panels _ a_-_g _ fourier squared coherence values remain reasonably high .",
    "we make use of the equations provided in @xcite which describe the dispersion relation for vertical acoustic waves propagating in the presence of a vertical magnetic field within a stratified isothermal atmosphere with radiative cooling .",
    "the equations were modified for this work to simplistically mimic the first order effects that acoustic - like ( low-@xmath0 slow - mode ) waves would experience when propagating along inclined field lines instead of purely vertically in a vertical magnetic field  i.e. , @xmath31 reduced gravity and 1/@xmath31 increased path length .    the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fft_upw_pro ] were calculated using the measured values of field inclination in solar coordinates along with the temperature ( 4000  k ) , radiative cooling time ( 55  s ) , and vertical height separation ( 1000  km ) given by @xcite for this sunspot umbra .",
    "although only a simple approximation to the expected dispersion relation for such waves , these curves show an encouraging association with the measured data points .",
    "in this section we present our findings in the context of results from previous studies in an attempt to provide answers to a few of the outstanding issues surrounding the relationship that rp waves share with other forms of sunspot waves .",
    "it has been long known that sunspot chromospheres oscillate at differing periods in different spatial regions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : he_fft_pow ] displays the variation of fourier power from the si and he los velocities in the form of space - frequency diagrams . individual power spectra from each spatial pixel have been normalized to the variance of the respective time series , resulting in white noise having power of 1 and 18.4 being the 99.99% significance level of poisson noise .",
    "normalization was performed to aid in the comparison of spectral profiles between spatial regions that exhibit vastly different los velocity amplitudes . rather than indicating some form of physical discontinuity , the change from dominant chromospheric 3-min power to longer periods near the umbra / penumbra boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_fft_pow]_b _ may just result from the magnetic field inclination becoming large enough to allow photospheric low - frequency ( i.e. , 5-min @xmath32-mode ) power to tunnel through the higher - frequency acoustic cutoff ( 5.2  mhz ) at the temperature minimum @xcite .",
    "we note that the classical interpretation of an acoustic cutoff is effectively negated by the inclusion of radiative cooling in the modeled dispersion relation of   [ subsubsec : dis_rel_fit ] , which allows wave reflection and transmission at all frequencies . however , the dominant chromospheric frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_fft_pow]_b _ is modified by the magnetic field inclination , closely following the strong - field limit @xmath31 relation of .",
    "power existing below the cutoff may be explained by the gradual transition from mainly reflected to transmitted waves around the cutoff ( i.e. , the slow turn - up in the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : fft_upw_pro ] ) .",
    "another possibility is the presence of unresolved structure in the chromospheric penumbra , consisting of either two spatially - separated distributions of field inclination along the los or an uncombed magnetic field configuration . if the more vertical distribution has the measured field inclinations and the other has values @xmath3320   larger , the acoustic cutoff curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_fft_pow]_b _ could be pulled to even lower frequencies . at larger field inclinations",
    "( i.e. , further into the penumbra ) little evidence is found of 3-min waves because power at 5-min period vastly exceeds that at 3-min in the underlying photosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : he_fft_pow]_a _ ) .",
    "the termination of 3-min wave patterns at the umbra / penumbra boundary noted by and @xcite and the fact that not all 3-min wavefronts can be traced out from the umbra into the penumbra has been used to suggest that rp waves are not associated with similar waves in the umbra . a simple check for the linkage of either 3-min or",
    "5-min waves between the chromospheric umbra and penumbra can be made by bandpass filtering the he velocity time series .",
    "the spatial variation of he los velocities through the umbra and penumbra is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min ] before and after filtering in the period ranges @xmath34  min and @xmath35  min .",
    "it is clear that each of the 3-min umbral wavefronts has a rapidly diminishing counterpart in the penumbra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min]_b _ ) , while each of the 5-min ( i.e. , rp ) wavefronts has an only somewhat weaker counterpart within the umbra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min]_c _ ) .",
    "these findings once again support the picture of a continuous variation of rp wave behaviour through the entirety of the sunspot atmosphere .",
    "if rp waves are indeed the `` visual pattern '' of upward - propagating waves we expect that the wave velocity amplitude along the field would be essentially constant through the penumbra , because each wavefront will have experienced the same degree of wave growth caused by the decrease of density with altitude . examination of the unfiltered he los velocity signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min]_a _ shows that the rms los velocity decreases throughout the penumbra .",
    "however , the correct quantity to consider is the rms velocity along the magnetic field vector .",
    "this was obtained from the rms los velocity ( solid curve in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min]_a _ ) using the measured field inclinations from the observer s los  resulting field - aligned rms velocities are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : filt_5min]_a _ by a dotted curve .",
    "the field - aligned rms velocities still show a decrease close to the umbra / penumbra boundary ( from a greatly diminished contribution of transmitted power at 3-min period ) but also a nearly constant value of @xmath331  km  s@xmath3 over pixels 45 to 25 of the penumbra , lending more credence to the `` visual pattern '' scenario .",
    "our results support the conclusion of @xcite that 3-min umbral waves are not the source of 5-min rp waves .",
    "however , we have additionally shown that they are in fact different manifestations of the same form of wave generated by a common source at the photosphere , their differences arising from the transmitted wave power available for propagation along differently inclined field lines .",
    "as such , the observed behaviour of waves in both umbrae and penumbrae can be explained without the need for abrupt changes in either density or field orientation at the umbra / penumbra boundary as postulated by , e.g. , .",
    "we have provided evidence that velocity signatures of rp waves observed in the he10830    multiplet are more compatible with upward - propagating waves than with trans - sunspot waves through careful consideration of the magnetic vector .",
    "comparing the fourier phase differences measured between paired pixels in the photosphere and chromosphere to the dispersion relation for field - aligned acoustic waves , modified for inclined fields , points toward such waves ( i.e. , essentially low-@xmath0 slow modes ) being responsible for the visual pattern .",
    "initially excited by a common source at the photosphere , waves experience increasing path length to the sampling height in the chromosphere with distance into the penumbra from travelling along increasingly inclined field lines  a scenario previously suggested by , e.g. , and @xcite . for essentially constant ( or weakly increasing ) propagation velocities , delays of increasing magnitude",
    "will be observed in the arrival times of wavefronts at increasing radial distance through sunspot penumbrae .",
    "it is the pattern of delayed wavefronts that gives rise to the apparent outward motion of rp waves which may also explain the large range of observed wave speeds  the horizontal `` speed '' of the delayed wavefronts at the chromosphere depends on the rate at which the magnetic field inclines out through penumbrae , permitting either sub - sonic or super - sonic horizontal `` speeds '' for different magnetic geometries .",
    "this scenario also indicates that rp waves may occur at the edges of large pores since the existence of a penumbra is not necessary to support them ; only sufficiently inclined field lines are required to direct the waves laterally .",
