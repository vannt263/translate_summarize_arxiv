    "a lot of effort has been focused on studying the spectrum and the properties of light quark mesons ( see @xcite-@xcite ) and references therein ) . in these systems",
    "non - perturbative effects are dominant , therefore they are the best candidates for understanding the mechanisms underlying confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking which are fundamental elements and of crucial importance for the theory . in some of these studies",
    "the quark propagator equation has provide useful insights in the light quark sector of qcd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to explore , using that fundamental block of the theory and the quarks bound state equation , the transition to heavy quark physics .",
    "we plan to canvass , by using an effective kernel for the gap equation , how the quark mass affects the infrared and ultraviolet dressing of the propagator and how that in turn will alter the dynamics of the bound state of quarks .",
    "a more realistic case of a quark mass dependent version of the effective kernel is also explored in the same light .",
    "the compton size of quarks and mesons is also used to qualitatively understand the relative infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) qcd dynamics and inspired an approach that enabled us to reach a physical bound state for @xmath0 q = u / d , s , c mesons .",
    "aspects related to the finite size of hadrons involving recent ideas by brodsky and shrock @xcite are also briefly discussed .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator ( gap equation ) has the form :    @xmath1    @xmath2 is the renormalized dressed gluon propagator , @xmath3 is the renormalized dressed quark - gluon vertex , @xmath4 is the regularization mass scale , with @xmath5 being the gluon and quark propagator renormalization constants .    using the rainbow truncation for the gap equation and introducing @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the free gluon propagator , we can disentangle the equation from the rest of the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "the unrenormalized quark self - energy term of the gap equation in the rainbow truncation is : @xmath9 where we have set @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the gluon momentum and the factor @xmath12 comes from the trace over the color indexes . by taking the dirac trace of the last equation we get : @xmath13 and",
    "if we multiply by @xmath14 and then take the dirac trace , we get the second equation : @xmath15 where we have introduced the quark propagator amplitudes @xmath16 , @xmath17 : @xmath18 the quark propagator in terms of @xmath19 , @xmath20 is then : @xmath21 using the propagator renormalization condition , @xmath22 , we get @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the renormalized current quark mass at point @xmath26 and it is a parameter we fit to experimental data .",

    "one may consider that such behavior of re(m ) and re(a ) justifies for a constituent like approximation for the b quark propagator . from the b quark re(@xmath72 )",
    "plot we found the singularities have not only moved , as was expected , deeper in the time - like region , along the real axis , but also further apart along the imaginary axis .",
    "this is exactly the opposite from a constituent - like behavior of a propagator . that also signifies the importance of the imaginary part of the dressed quark mass amplitude in the behavior of the propagator amplitudes @xmath72 and @xmath73 .     for the b quark in a parabolic region in the complex plane ( @xmath79 , @xmath29=0.50 ) with integration over the gluon momentum ( kcp ) with the full mt model .",

    "width=302,height=188 ]    in table [ table : full_ir_uv_approximate_singularities_location ] we collect the data for the approximate location ( @xmath67,@xmath68 ) of the singularities for the c and b propagators for the full , ir and uv gap solution . in that table",
    "we include a qualitative estimation of the quark mass dressing for each case .",
    "we assume that the location of the singularities along the real axis can be used to extract that piece of information . from these data",
    "we observe there is an increase in the quark mass dressing as we go from c to b quark using the full model .",
    "for the c quark there is an almost equal dressing from the ir and uv term of the interaction while for b quark the uv term provides more than twice the mass dressing of the ir term .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     with this modification of the dressing of the b - quark we can find meson masses that are only about 7 - 12 % smaller than the experimental ones . for the only decay constant experimentally known there is a -24.4 % difference .",
    "the present results and the earlier results for the equal quark systems appear to provide a partial confirmation of the recent suggestion by brodsky and shrock of a maximum wavelength for quarks and gluons in mesons @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a wavelength for quark and gluons would be due to confinement in mesons with size of the order of 1 fm .",
    "that in turn , through the compton relation , will introduce a minimum quark and gluon momentum inside hadrons .",
    "same reasoning can be applied to baryons .",
    "these scales though will depend on the bound state of quarks , requiring different scales to be artificially introduced for each case and mathematically accommodate the dyson - schwinger equations solution . if qcd is the correct theory for the interaction of quarks and gluons something like that is not desirable .",
    "the present studies may indicate a possible scenario for the natural realization of these scales through the combined ir dynamics of the quark mass dependent kernel and the quark propagators in full qcd calculations .",
    "some simple preliminary studies qualitatively support that idea but further and more detailed investigation is required .",
    "the size of the qq mesons becomes smaller as quark mass increases and the dressed quark quasi - particles themselves become smaller in size .",
    "the infrared component of the kernel relates to large distance gluons ; such components should be less physically relevant for internal dynamics of heavy , small compton size , particles .",
    "this is supported by our finding that the heavier qq quarkonia receive diminishing contributions from the infrared component of our model kernel ; the uv component alone provides a very good description of the @xmath81 states .",
    "we stress that this refers not only to the binding interaction but also to the quark self - energy dressing .    in detail , as the quark mass increases , due to its smaller compton size , uv dressing will increase and ir dressing will be strongly suppressed .",
    "model independent evidence indicate that the short distance dressing will be , after certain mass scale , more than the long distance dressing , and at a higher mass scale , it may be over and above the long distance dressing of the lightest u / d quarks .",
    "the heavy quarks will be limited in a smaller area in space and the binding force will be provided by the exchange of sort distance gluons , signifying a smaller overall binding energy .",
    "the heavy quark mass and the now relatively stronger uv dressing , _ triggered by _ that large mass , make feasible , with a very weak force , to bind the particles together .    on the other hand ,",
    "the qq mesons have a size that does not diminish significantly with increasing heavy quark mass .",
    "so the infrared sector of the binding interaction should remain relevant .",
    "however the self - energy dressing of the heavy quark should not receive strong contributions from large distance gluons .",
    "this becomes evident by our finding that a suppression of the infrared component of the b - quark dressing kernel allows a physical @xmath0 , @xmath82 meson state even though the binding effective interaction and the dressing of the light quarks remains unchanged .    in a similar way",
    "as the quark momentum increases the particle will become more localized , receiving _ simultaneously _ smaller infrared _ and _ ultraviolet dressing and feeling less of the color field of the other quark(s ) in the bound state .",
    "the wave - like nature of quarks can accommodate that interpretation .",
    "aspects of this study may be related to brodsky and shrock s suggestion of a maximum wavelength of quarks and gluons in hadrons .",
    "the present work may actually suggest a possible scenario for the natural realization of such scales in qcd .",
    "further studies are necessary in that direction .",
