    "studies of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in optical lattices ( ols ) is one of central topics in the current work on cold atoms @xcite .",
    "two types of spatially - periodic modulation of parameters of bec are possible under the action of ols .",
    "first is a periodic ( lattice ) potential for atoms , which represents the linear ol .",
    "the spatial periodicity of another kind can be realized in bec via a modulation of the atomic scattering length , i.e. , the effective local nonlinearity of the condensate , which is known as the nonlinear ol ( or a magnetic lattice @xcite , if the scattering length is affected by the magnetic field ) . new types of solitons and solitary vortices are possible in nonlinear lattices @xcite .",
    "both linear and nonlinear ols can be realized in condensates with atoms interacting via long - range dipolar - dipolar interactions ( ddi ) . due to the anisotropic and nonlocal character of the ddi , many remarkable new phenomena have been predicted and observed in these ultracold gases , such as new quantum phases , anisotropic collapse and suppression of the collapse , and specific modes of collective excitations @xcite , as well as stabilization of modulated patterns trapped in the ol potential , which are unstable in the bec with the contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the ddi may also give rise to localized modes in the form of stable two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite and one - dimensional ( 1d )  @xcite solitons and soliton complexes @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of the linear ol potential strongly facilitates the creation and stabilization of solitons in dipolar condensates @xcite .",
    "a new type of lattice structures can be created in dipolar condensates , by means of a spatially periodic modulation of the strength of the ddi .",
    "in fact , these are _ nonlocal nonlinear lattices _ , as the ddi represents long - range cubic interactions .",
    "nonlocal nonlinear lattices of different types are possible too in optical media with the thermal nonlinearity  @xcite . in the dipolar bec ,",
    "one possibility for the creation of such a lattice is to use a condensate of atoms or molecules with permanent magnetic or electric dipolar moments , and apply a spatially nonuniform ( misaligned ) polarizing field , under the action of which the mutual orientation of the moments varies in space periodically .",
    "another approach may make use of a condensate of polarizable atoms or molecules , in which the moments are induced by the external field @xcite , whose strength varies periodically along the system . in either case , the necessary periodically nonuniform external magnetic fields can be induced by the currently available magnetic lattices  @xcite . if the condensate is formed by particles with permanent or induced electric moments , the corresponding electric field can be supplied by similarly designed ferroelectric lattices .",
    "the electrostriction effects on ddi induced by a far - off - resonant standing laser field can also lead to a periodic structure in the dipolar bec  @xcite .",
    "such systems are described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with a spatially varying nonlocal nonlinearity .",
    "the objective of the present work is to investigate the existence and stability of effectively 1d  @xcite solitons in the dipolar bec under the action of nonlocal nonlinear lattices .",
    "here we focus on the model which assumes permanent moments with a periodically varying orientation .",
    "the soliton modes will be studied by means of a variational approximation ( va ) , and with the help of direct numerical simulations of the respective gp equation . for direct simulations ,",
    "we have employed a relaxation algorithm applied to the gp equation , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section ii .",
    "analytical results ( the va , and some simplification of the full model ) are reported in section iii .",
    "numerical results are summarized and compared to the variational predictions in section iv , and the paper is concluded by section v.",
    "under the assumption that that the external field imposes an orientation of permanent magnetic moments periodically varying along the @xmath0axis , the corresponding dipolar bec obeys the following nonlocal gp equation@xcite : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the renormalized @xmath3-wave scattering length , which includes a contribution from the ddi : @xmath4 , \\;\\;\\;\\mathrm{with}\\;\\;\\;\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm{dd}}= \\frac{md^{2}}{3\\hbar ^{2}a_{s}}\\equiv \\frac{a_{d}}{3a_{s } } ,   \\label{eq02}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the proper scattering length , which characterizes collisions between the particles , @xmath6 is the average value of the dipole s orientation angle , and @xmath7 , defined by the dipole momentum @xmath8 and the atomic mass @xmath9 , plays the role of the effective ddi scattering length . in the above expressions , @xmath10 is the transverse trapping frequency , which defines the respective trapping radius , @xmath11 .",
    "the reduction of the full gp equation to its 1d form ( [ eq02 ] ) is valid provided that the peak density of the condensate , @xmath12 , is small enough to make the nonlinear term much weaker than the transverse confinement , and prevent excitation of transverse models by the ddis , i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the vacuum permittivity . in this case",
    ", the 3d wave function may be factorized as @xmath15 , with the transverse radial mode @xmath16 taken as the ground state of the confining harmonic - oscillator potential . after performing the integration over the transverse radius @xmath17 in the gp equation , we arrive at the quasi-1d equation ( [ eq01 ] ) .    the exact ddi  kernel @xmath18 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) has a rather cumbersome form @xcite , but it may be approximated reasonably well by  @xcite @xmath19 where a cutoff parameter @xmath20 , which truncates the formal singularity , is on the order of the transverse radius of the cigar - shaped trap , @xmath21 . in the following",
    ", the variables are rescaled as @xmath22 with the corresponding dimensionless cutoff parameter fixed to be @xmath23 .",
    "further , the function @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) describes the modulation of the ddi due to the variation of the dipoles orientation along the @xmath0axis , @xmath25 where we assume that the local angle of the orientation of the dipoles with respect to the @xmath0axis is periodically modulated as follows : @xmath26 the periodic variation of @xmath27 can be induced by magnetic lattices ( mls ) , which have been constructed on the basis of ferromagnetic films with permanent periodic structures built into them , the condensate being loaded into the ml @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the ground state of the dipolar bec is formed by an elongated trap with a strong magnetic field @xmath28 , whose relevant value may be estimated as @xmath29200 g. the periodic modulation of the ddi is then induced by the ml with the amplitude of the respective component of the magnetic field @xmath30 g and a modulation period @xmath31 @xmath32 m , which is within the same order of the magnitude as a typical ol period .",
    "the regular ml can be constructed to include @xmath33 sites , which is quite sufficient to observe the localized modes described below  @xcite .",
    "with regard to the rescaling ( [ rescale ] ) , the combined kernel in eq .
