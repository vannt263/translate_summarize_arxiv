    "we review and present a self - contained study of the dynamics of such skew product systems , characterizing the different possible dynamics .",
    "this may seem a restrictive setup , but these systems exhibit a wealth of dynamical behavior that serves as models for dynamics in more general systems .",
    "these step skew product systems provide a setting to study all possible compositions of the two maps @xmath17 in a single framework .",
    "indeed , for initial conditions @xmath18 , the coordinate in @xmath10 iterates as @xmath19 the maps @xmath7 , @xmath8 simply move points to either smaller or larger values .",
    "we will pick the diffeomorphisms @xmath7 and @xmath8 randomly , independently at each iterate , with positive probabilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to taking a bernoulli measure on @xmath22 from which we pick @xmath23 .",
    "the obtained random compositions thus form a ( nonhomogeneous ) random walk on the interval .",
    "the dynamics of the step skew product system depends on the lyapunov exponents at the boundaries @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we list the possibilities , which will be worked out in subsequent sections below .",
    "intermingled basins : :    with negative lyapunov exponents at the boundaries , these boundaries    are attracting .",
    "their basins are intermingled : any open set in    @xmath26 intersects both basins .",
    "master - slave synchronization : :    with positive lyapunov exponents at the boundaries , the boundaries are    repelling .",
    "we find that for almost all fibers    @xmath27 , orbits of points in the    same fiber converge to each other , i.e. synchronize .",
    "on - off intermittency : :    a zero lyapunov exponent at a boundary makes that boundary neutral .    with the other boundary repelling , a typical time series has long    laminary phases where the orbit is close to the `` off '' state ( the    neutral boundary ) and has bursts where the orbit is in the `` on ''    state , i.e. away from the neutral boundary .",
    "orbits spend a portion of    its iterates with full density near the neutral boundary . with two    neutral boundaries ,",

    "random walk with drift : :    with one attracting and one repelling or neutral boundary , most orbits    approach the attracting boundary .",

    "a natural generalization is also to let the diffeomorphisms on @xmath10 depend on @xmath23 more generally than through @xmath28 alone ; @xmath29 one can further consider parameters @xmath23 from other spaces than symbol spaces , with other dynamics than generated by the shift operator .",
    "one may then also generalize the skew product structure to maps on fiber bundles , and study perturbations that destroy the skew product structure . a heuristic principle going back to @xcite states that phenomena in random dynamics on compact manifolds",
