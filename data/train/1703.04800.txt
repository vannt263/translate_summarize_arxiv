    "<S> using a fully - fledged formulation of gauge field theory deformed by the spacetime noncommutativity , we study its impact on relic neutrino direct detection , as proposed recently by the ptolemy experiment . the noncommutative background tends to influence the propagating neutrinos by providing them with a generation blind tree - level vector - like coupling to photons , enabling thus otherwise sterile neutrinos to be thermally produced in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> such a new component in the universe s background radiation has been switched today to the almost fully active sea of non - relativistic neutrinos , exerting consequently some impact on the capture on tritium at ptolemy . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarities of our nonperturbative approach tend to reflect in the cosmology as well , upon appearances of the maximal decoupling temperature @xmath0 as well as the maximal scale of noncommutativity @xmath1 , above which there is no impact whatsoever on the capture rates at ptolemy .    out of the three pillars of the standard big bang model , the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite relates directly to neutrinos and provides us with useful ( but somewhat indirect ) information about the universe when it was just about 1 minute old . on the other hand , another pillar of the big bang , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , the relic radiation left over from the moment the universe cooled off and became transparent , which because of that allows us to see directly into cosmos when it was 380000 years old , had been measured recently so precisely that this has deepened our understanding of the early universe to a hitherto undreamed - of scale @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a related prediction of the standard theory is the undisputed existence of a relic neutrino background , whose direct detection would enable to see what was the universe doing when it was only about one second old .    </S>",
    "<S> besides neutrinos do interact only feebly with ordinary matter , the relic neutrino background turns out to be composed altogether of neutrinos which are nonrelativistic today , making them consequently very difficult to directly detect in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> this also turns out to be the only primary source of nonrelativistic neutrinos in the universe at present .    </S>",
    "<S> a first promising proposal put forward to detect such a cold sea of neutrinos at the temperature of around 2 kelvin , was to use the inverse beta decay of tritium nucleus , @xmath2h@xmath3he@xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of detecting such a background experimentally , using this process , was investigated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> earlier attempts to detect relic neutrino sea were precisely compiled , but also strongly criticized in @xcite . with the recently proposed ptolemy experiment , with an energy resolution @xmath5 ev and implementing a 100 gram sample of tritium , the detection of relic neutrino background might soon become a dream come true @xcite .    for a long time , </S>",
    "<S> the bbn has proven as one of the most powerful available probes of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , giving many interesting constraints on particle properties . </S>",
    "<S> the bbn had begun to play a central role in constraining particle properties since the seminal paper of steigman , schramm and gunn @xcite , in which the observation - based determination of the primordial abundance of @xmath6he was used for the first time to constrain the number of light neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> later , with the inclusion of other light element abundances ( d,@xmath7he and @xmath8li ) and their successful agreement with the theoretically predicted abundances , many aspects of physics beyond sm can have been further constrained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one usually parameterizes the energy density of new relativistic particles in the early universe in terms of the effective additional number of neutrino species , @xmath9 . after past decades vagueness in pinpointing @xmath10 , a combination of @xmath11 observation ( @xmath11 2015 results @xcite ) with other astrophysical data has recently strongly constrained the neutrino sector of the theory , giving @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> since these data pinpoint @xmath13 @xcite , one finds this consistent with the standard model value @xmath14 itself .    entertaining the possibility to thermally produce right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos @xmath15 in some extension of the standard model </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the energy density of 3 light rh neutrinos during bbn is equivalent to the effective number @xmath10 of additional doublet neutrinos @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the temperature of the sm neutrinos , being the same as that of photons down to @xmath18 mev . </S>",
    "<S> hence we have @xmath19 in the following we take the latest planck result , @xmath20 .    how the temperature of @xmath21 s , which decoupled at @xmath22 , relates to the temperature of still interacting @xmath23 s below @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> stems easily from the fact that the entropy in the decoupled species and the entropy in the still interacting ones are separately conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the temperatures is a function of @xmath22 and is given by @xcite @xmath24^{1/3 } , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the degrees of freedom specifying the entropy of the decoupled and of the interacting species , respectively @xcite . since in our case </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the possibility that the decoupled particles may subsequently annihilate into other non - interacting species , @xmath25 stays constant after decoupling and therefore , for all practical purposes , the first ratio in ( 3 ) equals unity .    </S>",
    "<S> now , combining ( 2 ) with ( 3 ) and noting that at the time of bbn @xmath27 , one arrives at @xmath28 with the latest bound @xmath29 , ( 4 ) implies @xmath30 which in turn enforces @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the critical temperature for the deconfinement restoration phase transition , @xmath33 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> since background neutrinos are ultra - relativistic at freeze out , the left - handed neutrinos @xmath34 almost exactly coincide with the left - helical neutrinos @xmath35 ( similarly for anti - neutrinos ) , which means that in the standard theory the right - helical neutrinos @xmath36 are ( practically ) no populated at all . </S>",
    "<S> if , by some mechanism , the right - handed neutrinos @xmath15 were thermally produced in the early universe , they again almost exactly coincide with the right - helical neutrinos @xmath36 ( and similarly for anti - neutrinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> since for free - streaming neutrinos it is their helicity that is conserved @xcite , and the relic neutrino background is non - relativistic today ( for neutrino masses @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> ev ) , one finds that non - relativistic right - helical neutrinos @xmath36 are no longer inert , in fact , they can ( almost ) equally be captured in the @xmath2h@xmath3he@xmath4 process as their left - helical partners @xmath35 s do .    </S>",
    "<S> as calculated in detail in @xcite ( for earlier calculations see also @xcite ) the total capture rate boils down to a simple expression @xmath38 n_{trit } , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the number of tritium nuclei and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number densities of left- and right - helical neutrinos per degree of freedom . in the standard theory </S>",
    "<S> , both active degrees of freedom for the massive majorana case equally contribute to the process , while in the dirac case only one active ( out of four ) degrees of freedom does so . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the capture rate in the majorana case is twice that in the dirac case @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when the right - handed neutrinos are produced by some non - standard mechanism in the early universe , their relative contribution in ( 5 ) is given by the ratio of the temperatures cubed ( @xmath44 ) , as given by ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the ratio ( 3 ) remains constant below @xmath45 mev , as both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are then decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> this implies around 20% magnification of the capture rate at ptolemy if @xmath46 and around 10% magnification if @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the critical temperature for electroweak phase transition , @xmath49 gev .    as a working example to realize a thermal production of @xmath36 s in the early universe , via plasmon decay into neutrino pairs @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a fully - fledged seiberg - witten map based @xcite @xmath50-exact formulation of noncommutative ( nc ) gauge field theory that preserves unitarity @xcite , has a correct commutative limit @xcite , and for which it has been shown that a nice uv / ir behavior at the quantum level could also be achieved , especially when supersymmetry is properly included @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from the noncommutative @xmath50-exact tree - level - vector - like generation - blind neutrino - photon interaction @xcite , the standard @xmath51-matrix algebra and the integration over the outgoing neutrino momenta yield the total rate of the plasmon at rest decay into massless neutrinos @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the fine structure constant , and for the light - like noncommutativity specified in @xcite , corresponds to @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . ] </S>",
    "<S> the full noncommutative effect will be still exhibited through @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the plasma frequency @xmath57 is determined as the frequency of plasmons at @xmath58 . in the regime where the motion of background electrons is irrelevant , </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the dispersion relation for transverse and longitudinal waves can be calculated analytically , giving ( see e. g. @xcite ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the transverse part of the one - loop contribution to the photon self - energy at finite temperature / density and @xmath63 is the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> now we continue with the investigation of the relic neutrino background in the noncommutative spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the rh neutrino is commonly considered to decouple at the temperature @xmath22 when the condition @xmath64 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency in this case is @xmath65 while the hubble expansion rate satisfies @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the degrees of freedom specifying the entropy of the interacting species for all and charged species , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> computing the decoupling temperature @xmath22 based on the assumption that the decay rate ( [ decouple ] ) is solely due to noncommutative effects and comparing with lower bounds on @xmath22 that can be inferred from observational data , we can determine lower bounds on the scale of noncommutativity @xmath69 . proceeding in this spirit </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that the bbn provides the following relation between the decoupling temperature @xmath22 and the nc scale @xmath69 : @xmath70 since the pre - factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tdecxi ] ) is amplified by the planck mass @xmath71 , we can test the @xmath50-exact nc plasmon - neutrino interaction given in @xcite only for @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , such a precision in observational data is not expected to be reached anytime soon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to account for decoupling temperatures associated to cosmological phase transitions ( @xmath73 gev ) , we have to require @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this only occurs when @xmath75 , corresponds to the limit @xmath76 , or @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> zero decoupling temperature corresponds to the vanishing of the hubble expansion rate , while the infinite scale of noncommutativity limit corresponds to the vanishing noncommutativity ( @xmath78 ) producing vanishing nc contribution to the plasmon decay rate . ] so that within this regime we can use the leading order term in the taylor expansion in @xmath79 and obtain : @xmath80 now setting further @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 gev ( quark - hadron phase transition ) , a lower bound on @xmath84 can be obtained as @xmath85 for @xmath86 gev ( @xmath87 phase transition ) , we have @xmath88 confirming the previous results obtained by making use of scattering processes of @xmath15 s @xcite . in other works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have found that scale of noncommutativity certainly is larger than a few tev s and is sitting around a few thousand tev s . </S>",
    "<S> this is anyway much below maximal scale of noncommutativity obtained in this paper , see i.e. fig.[fig : plasmon ] .    since the equation   is exact with respect to the scale of noncommutativity , it is interesting to extend our investigation to a temperature range well beyond the validity of the @xmath50-first order approximation  , which is done by numerical evaluation and shown in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : plasmon ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find , surprisingly , that due to the switch in the behavior of the plasmon decay rate from @xmath89 at low temperatures to @xmath90 at very high temperatures the solution curve actually drops down at a temperature range roughly independent from the nc scale and singles out a closed region on the scale of noncommutativity @xmath69 versus decoupling temperature @xmath22 . within this region surrounded by the solid curve , the hubble expansion rate   is smaller than the nc plasmon decay rate   and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the higher temperature solution(s ) at each given noncommutative scale , sitting on the right - hand side of the solid curve , may be interpreted as the `` coupling temperature '' , i.e. the temperature where the nc plasmon decay rate first catches ( or it may be the reheating temperature , whichever is lower ) the hubble rate during cooling .     versus decoupling temperature @xmath22 according to the eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( solid curve ) , and its @xmath50-first order approximation   ( dashed curve).,width=321 ]    as the temperature decreases further , the decay rate once again drops below the hubble rate , starting at the lower temperature / left - hand side solution on the solid curve . </S>",
    "<S> the equation   actually allows us to estimate the `` coupling temperature '' analytically : in any case it has to be smaller than twice of a fixed temperature scale @xmath91 because of the @xmath92 term sitting in the parenthesis , while for sufficiently small noncommutative scales it converges exactly to @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this together with the appearances of the maximal decoupling temperature @xmath94 as well as the maximal scale of noncommutativity @xmath95 , above which there is no impact whatsoever on the capture rates at ptolemy , represent additional important results of our work .    </S>",
    "<S> in total we have shown that the ptolemy total capture rate in the dirac case may be enhanced in the present scenario up to 20@xmath96 ( 10@xmath96 ) if the scale of noncommutativity @xmath97{$>$ } } \\put(.7,-0.3){\\makebox(0.0,1.)[b]{$\\sim$ } } \\end{picture}o}(10)$ ] tev @xmath98{$>$ } } \\put(.7,-0.3){\\makebox(0.0,1.)[b]{$\\sim$ } } \\end{picture}o}(10 ^ 3))$ ] tev . </S>",
    "<S> this is still consistent with the bunch of constraints on the scale of noncommutativity obtained from particle physics phenomenology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , one adopts a more `` natural '' value for @xmath69 , which is closer to the string ( or even planck @xcite ) scale , then the total capture stays as predicted by the standard theory . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the results of the ptolemy experiment could not only be used as a test of noncommutative gauge field theories , but also could provide an independent constraint on the scale of noncommutative deformation of spacetime as well . </S>"
