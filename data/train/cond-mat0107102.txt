    "the reason for the discrepancy between the calculated and measured @xmath118 is to be sought in the mechanism responsible for it in si.@xcite within the harmonic approximation @xmath121 for si , ge , and @xmath32-sn , because the raman frequency is at the maximum of the spectrum and thus corresponds to zero density of one - phonon states .",
    "the rather small , but non - negligible , observed value of @xmath118 results from the dos induced at the @xmath122-point by the anharmonic interactions responsible for the linewidth of the isotopically pure crystals .",

    "the _ ab initio _ calculations of @xmath118 for ge , however , give values which are an order of magnitude larger than the experimental ones , a fact that can be attributed to numerical errors in the calculated dos near the van hove singularity which is found at the raman frequency .    according to the values listed in table  [ tab : comparison ]",
    "one can clearly distinguish between two different behaviors in the magnitudes of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "diamond exhibits a relatively large disorder - induced shift , @xmath78 , whereas the other elemental crystals have much smaller values .",
    "this largely reflects the factor of @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ delta_2 ] ) .",
    "the difference is even more striking for @xmath79 , which nearly vanishes for si , ge and @xmath32-sn .",
    "this can be explained also by the different orders of perturbation theory coming into play .",
    "the overbending of the phonon dispersion of diamond introduces large ( second - order ) isotopic disorder effects which are not present in the case of si , ge , and @xmath32-sn because of their vanishing dos at the frequency of the raman phonon .",

    "<S> reasonable approximations are imposed that allow us to derive explicit expressions for the ratio of successive perturbation terms of the real and the imaginary part of the self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> this basic theoretical approach is compatible with raman spectroscopic results on diamond and silicon , with calculations based on the coherent potential approximation , and with theoretical results obtained using _ ab initio _ electronic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the formalism to binary compounds , by taking into account the eigenvectors at the individual sublattices , is straightforward . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> , we interpret recent experimental results on the disorder - induced broadening of the to ( folded ) modes of sic with a @xmath3-enriched carbon sublattice .  </S>"
