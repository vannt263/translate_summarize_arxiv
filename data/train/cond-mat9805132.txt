    "central to the understanding of any system with long - ranged order is a description of its collective excitations . if the hamiltonian has a continuous symmetry which is broken in the ground state , their spectrum is gapless ( as implied by the existence of goldstone modes ) and they dominate low - temperature thermodynamic properties .",
    "one of the most familiar examples of such a system is the heisenberg model , whose collective excitations are pure spin waves . with @xmath1 , antiferromagnetic ( af ) nearest - neighbour interactions and on a bipartite lattice , the ground state of the hamiltonian has long - ranged magnetic order in three dimensions @xmath2@xcite . while no exact solution exists for @xmath3 , a successful and longstanding approach to the ground state and collective excitations of the model",
    "is given by linear spin - wave theory ( lsw)@xcite , in which particle - hole pairs created out of the nel mean - field ground state are treated as bosons .",
    "the theory becomes exact in the limit @xmath4 , and @xmath5 corrections can be systematically incorporated@xcite ; but even in @xmath6 , lsw estimates for the sublattice magnetization , spin wave velocity and ground state energy are in good agreement with quantum monte carlo calculations ( qmc ) ( see e.g. ref . for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "it is well known that the af heisenberg model represents the strong coupling limit of the half - filled hubbard model@xcite . at finite interaction strengths @xmath7",
    ", the mean - field ground state remains the nel state ( albeit with self - consistently determined local moment magnitudes ) and gives a qualitatively sound description of the true ground state in @xmath8 .",
    "the collective excitation spectrum is however considerably more complex than that of the heisenberg model , since its low - frequency spin wave excitations are mixed with incoherent , stoner - like processes , leading to @xmath9 particle - hole excitations in contrast to the @xmath10 spin waves which alone survive in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the generalization of lsw to finite interaction strengths is given by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) about the fully unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) saddle point .",
    "although naively thought of as a weak - coupling theory , it reduces precisely to lsw in the strong coupling limit , an observation which has led a number of authors to conclude it to be a sound way of probing the collective excitations of the hubbard model over a wide range of interaction strengths : for example , such an approach has been successfully used to investigate the transverse spin excitation spectrum of the hubbard model both in @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath6 ( see e.g. refs ) .    in the present work",
    "we consider initially the collective excitation spectrum of the hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this is shown to possess two distinct bands for all interaction strengths @xmath7 : a low - energy spin wave - like band corresponding primarily to orientational fluctuations of the local moments , extending down to zero frequency and containing two goldstone modes ; and an upper band of stoner - like excitations , to which there is a gap due to fermi - surface nesting in the corresponding single - particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "the latter involve a significant degree of charge transfer character ( site double - occupancy ) and are projected out in the large @xmath7 limit , leaving solely the low - frequency excitations , which become the pure spin waves of the heisenberg model .",
    "it is found that , despite mixing between the two bands at finite @xmath7 , the low - frequency excitations retain a strong degree of spin wave character down to weak interaction strengths .",
    "a problem about which very little is known , even at a qualitative level , is the effect of disorder on the collective excitation spectrum . in a disordered system ,",
    "the collective excitations are governed by the interplay of a number of complex processes , including strong correlations of particle - hole pairs , anderson localization of the underlying single - particle states , and the non - trivial statistics associated with the distributions of local charges and magnetic moments arising from inhomogeneity in the site environments .    even at the mean field level of uhf , the combined effects of disorder and electron interactions in leading to strongly inhomogeneous ground states yield rich behaviour , as shown by a recent study of the zero - temperature uhf phase diagram of a site - disordered anderson - hubbard model@xcite ( ahm ) .",
    "further , at rpa level , these ground states in turn give rise to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic response properties@xcite .",
    "in particular , disorder is found to lead to a significant enhancement in local static susceptibilities over those in the pure system , this enhancement being strongly site - differential .",
    "the behaviour of static and dynamic susceptibilities in both the spin and charge channels ultimately reflects the character and distribution of collective excitations about the ground state .",
    "the observed site - differential enhancements mentioned above naturally raise questions both of how disorder affects the excitation spectra of the model and of the spatial distribution and localization characteristics of the excitations .",
    "in addition , the stability of the long - ranged order present in the mean - field ground state towards zero point spin fluctuations , and the low - temperature properties of the model , are also governed by the rpa excitations .",
    "we here investigate of the rpa spectrum of a @xmath0 anderson - hubbard model with gaussian site - disorder , throughout the disorder - interaction phase plane . in section",
    "ii , we discuss generic properties of the model and describe the procedure for calculating and characterizing the collective excitation spectrum at rpa level .",
    "after a brief discussion of the pure hubbard model in section iii , we focus in section iv on the ahm , concentrating on the distribution , character and localization properties of the low - frequency excitations , with particular emphasis on the existence or otherwise of a spin wave - like band in the transverse excitation spectrum at finite disorder . we conclude in section v with a discussion of the extent to which a recently developed mapping of the excitations of the hubbard model@xcite onto those of an effective spin model , can be applied to the disordered system .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath7 is the ( repulsive ) on - site coulomb interaction and the @xmath14 sum is over nearest neighbour sites on a @xmath0 simple cubic lattice .",
    "the site energies @xmath15 are drawn randomly from a common gaussian distribution @xmath16 of variance @xmath17 which , together with eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) , specifies the anderson - hubbard model considered here ; and we focus exclusively on half - filling . making a spin - rotationally invariant uhf approximation to the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) allows the hamiltonian to be expressed as @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a spin-@xmath21 operator and the overbar denotes an expectation over the uhf ground state .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram of @xmath22 in the @xmath23 plane has been discussed extensively in ref . ;",
    "aspects of this study necessary for the present work will be summarized briefly in  iva . here",
    "we note that , while a rich variety of phases arises , all mean - field magnetic ground states are found to be ising - like ( i.e. fully collinear local moments , with @xmath24 for all sites @xmath25 ) , with @xmath26 .",
    "collective excitations about these ground states , obtained via the rpa , then decouple into two sets @xcite : for frequencies @xmath27 there exist @xmath28 spin excitations transverse to the local moment @xmath29-axis , and @xmath28 longitudinal spin and charge excitations . in the non - disordered ( @xmath30 ) hubbard model",
    "there is a gap to longitudinal spin excitations for all @xmath31@xcite , reflecting the presence of a gap in the single - particle density of states ( dos ) .",
    "by contrast the transverse excitation spectrum is gapless ( as reflected by the presence of goldstone modes ) . with disorder present ,",
    "the dominant low - energy collective excitations are again found in the transverse spin channel .",
    "we thus focus here on the transverse spin spectrum , since it is these excitations which govern measured susceptibilities ( the existence of a spin - flop transition implying that only transverse excitations are in practice probed @xcite ) , and which are dominant in determining low - temperature thermodynamic properties",
    ".      the equations of motion for the rpa particle - hole excitations are straightforwardly derived ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "however , solution of these equations requires diagonalization of a @xmath32 non - hermitian matrix , a procedure limited to impractically small system sizes .",
    "an alternative and viable procedure is to exploit the fact that , because the interaction term @xmath33 contains only on - site terms , expressions for the rpa dynamic susceptibilities ( derived either diagrammatically or via linear response theory @xcite ) , involve only matrices of order @xmath10 .",
    "specifically , the transverse spin susceptibility    @xmath34    is given by    @xmath35^{-1 } ~~ , \\label{chieq}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 is the corresponding uhf transverse susceptibility obtained by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath39 in eq .",

    "we add in passing that the fermi energy is pinned at @xmath45 for all disorder strengths @xmath46 , since the familiar particle - hole symmetry characteristic of the non - disordered limit is preserved for all @xmath47 with the symmetric gaussian @xmath16@xcite .",
    "( [ uhfchi ] ) is just the lehmann representation for the retarded polarization propagator appropriate to the uhf ground state , with poles at the stoner excitation energies .",
    "when @xmath48 does not coincide with a pole , this real symmetric matrix is diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix @xmath49 with eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "most importantly , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ chieq ] ) , this transformation also diagonalizes @xmath51 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath52 $ ] , viz :    @xmath53    rpa transverse collective excitations correspond to the @xmath48-poles of @xmath51 , which thus occur at @xmath54 , i.e. whenever an eigenvalue of @xmath37 crosses @xmath55 .",
    "further , since @xmath56 , a knowledge of the ( positive and negative ) poles of @xmath51 alone is sufficient to determine the full transverse spin excitation spectrum .",
    "two final points concerning the poles @xmath51 should be made before proceeding .",
    "first , the broken symmetry of any magnetic uhf state implies the presence of a zero - frequency goldstone mode in both @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ensuring that the transverse excitation spectrum is gapless .",
    "second , the @xmath48-poles occur correctly on the real axis only if the uhf ground state is fully stable against particle - hole excitations ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "an eigenstate of @xmath22 which is not a true minimum on the uhf total energy surface leads to imaginary-@xmath48 excitations which carry the system away from the saddle point , rendering it unstable . in this regard , and even when the mean - field _ solutions _ are ising - like , use of a fully unrestricted and spin - rotationally invariant hartree - fock approximation is an essential prerequisite , since it ensures the mean - field states are minima .    in studying collective excitations at rpa level ,",
    "a pole search on @xmath51 ( eqs ( 2.4,5 ) ) is powerful , since it allows study of much larger system sizes than direct solution of the rpa equations .",
    "we now outline this procedure . from eq .",
    "( [ uhfchi ] ) , @xmath37 itself has poles at the uhf excitation energies but , in the intervals between the poles , the eigenvalues @xmath50 of @xmath37 are continuous functions of @xmath48 .",
    "for a given disorder realization , we thus determine the excitation spectrum as follows .",
    "( i ) solution of the uhf problem yields the uhf excitation energies and hence the intervals over which the eigenvalues @xmath59 are finite .",
    "( ii ) diagonalization of @xmath37 for @xmath48 at the beginning and the end of each interval yields the number of eigenvalues which have crossed @xmath55 and hence the number of rpa poles in each interval .",
    "( iii ) finer resolution may then be obtained using , for example , a bisection technique .",
    "important information concerning the character of a given excitation of frequency @xmath60 can be obtained from the eigenvector coefficients @xmath61 .    in the strong coupling limit @xmath62",
    ", the resultant af heisenberg model contains @xmath10 transverse particle - hole excitations , corresponding to linear combinations of solely on - site spin flips .",
    "these are just the familiar pure spin waves . at finite @xmath31 ,",
    "off - site spin flip excitations also contribute to the transverse spectrum , such that while there is spin - charge separation ( in the sense that the transverse spin and longitudinal / charge channels decouple@xcite ) , the transverse excitations themselves possess some charge - transfer character .",
    "it is particularly instructive to evaluate the on - site spin flip ( or spin wave ) contribution to a given excitation , as now considered .",
    "the lehmann representation for the diagonal elements of the rpa susceptibility is given generally by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are rpa ground and excited states and @xmath66 are the rpa excitation energies .",
    "( [ chivecs ] ) , @xmath67 is expressible in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath37 : @xmath68 to compare eqs ( [ lehmann ] ) and ( [ chiii ] ) , we analytically continue eq .",

    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 is dominated by the @xmath74 term and is given to leading order by @xmath75 comparison of eqs ( [ chiiiop ] ) and ( [ lehmann ] ) implies    @xmath76    and @xmath77    ( in order that the poles of @xmath51 occur in the correct half - plane ) ; together with the central result that , for the given pole ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 .",
    "further , since the eigenvector coefficients @xmath80 are by construct normalized , the sum rule    @xmath81    follows . that this sum is not",
    "unity simply reflects the fact that , at finite @xmath31 , rpa transverse spin excitations have finite weight outside the on - site spin flip subspace , i.e. matrix elements of the form @xmath82 with @xmath83 are non - zero ; for example it may be shown that the general rpa normalization expressed in a site basis implies that @xmath84 for rpa excitations corresponding to positive-@xmath48 poles . only in the strong coupling limit",
    "@xmath85 are these off - site excitations effectively projected out of the transverse spin spectrum .",
    "the interpretation of the eigenvectors @xmath86 is therefore clear : from eqs ( [ dlambda ] ) and ( [ dlambda2 ] ) the set of coefficients",

    "( note that , to generalize to a disordered system , we use the term ` spin wave ' to denote any excitation with @xmath91 , regardless of its @xmath92-resolution . )",
    "the above interpretation may also be exploited to define an inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) for the collective excitations , in analogy to the familiar ipr employed in the study of localization of single - particle states @xcite , via @xmath93 using eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) , this may be expressed as @xmath94 @xmath95 is on the order of the inverse of the number of sites overlapped by the excitation at @xmath60 : for an excitation receiving uniform contributions from @xmath96 sites , @xmath97 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "@xmath98 is thus zero for a delocalized excitation and non - zero for a localized excitation . for a finite - sized system @xmath99 necessarily , requiring the estimation of a threshold ipr , appropriate to a given system size .",
    "while for the single - particle excitations of the ( non - interacting ) anderson model , such a threshold ipr can be addressed via finite - size scaling @xcite , we have no information on the @xmath10-scaling of @xmath98 in the present system . in ",
    "iv , however , we argue that a qualitative understanding of the localization characteristics of transverse spin excitations may nonetheless be obtained .",
    "before discussing the effects of disorder on the transverse excitation spectrum of the anderson - hubbard model , we first consider briefly the important non - disordered limit . in this case , for all @xmath100 , the uhf single - particle spectrum @xmath101 has a band gap of magnitude @xmath102 , with @xmath103 the self - consistent uhf local moment magnitude ; and in which lies the fermi level @xmath45@xcite .",
    "consequently , the pure uhf particle - hole excitation spectrum consists of a single stoner band beginning at @xmath104 , with a maximum at @xmath105 .",
    "the full rpa spectrum of collective transverse spin excitations consists , by contrast , of two distinct components ( we consider @xmath106 throughout , since the spectrum is symmetric in @xmath48 ) .",
    "first , a low frequency band containing precisely @xmath10 excitations of predominantly spin wave character ( discussed below ) , and extending down to @xmath107 as implied by the presence of the goldstone modes for all @xmath100 .",
    "second , a high frequency band containing @xmath108 stoner - like excitations , which closely resembles the corresponding pure uhf transverse spin spectrum : it begins at @xmath104 the gap in the uhf single - particle spectrum and has maximum spectral density for @xmath105 .",
    "this stoner - like band is effectively eliminated as @xmath109 . for all @xmath100 , however , it may be shown to be separated from the top of the low frequency band by a spectral gap , i.e. there is a persistent separation of scales between the low energy spin wave - like band and higher energy stoner - like excitations .",
    "for this reason we focus exclusively on the low-@xmath48 component of the spectrum .",
    "the prescription of  ii , reformulated in a two - sublattice basis@xcite appropriate to the half - filled , non - disordered model , allows the rpa spectrum to be determined ; in practice we find that a lattice of @xmath110 @xmath111-points ( corresponding to @xmath112 ) is required to give a sufficiently dense spectrum .",
    "[ f7 ] shows the resultant density of the lowest @xmath10 transverse spin excitations , given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the frequency of the @xmath115 excitation , for large coupling @xmath116 .",

    "the spectrum of low - frequency transverse spin excitations of the hubbard model thus closely resembles that of the nn heisenberg model at large @xmath31 as expected , since as @xmath62 the former maps exactly onto the latter although as seen there is a not inappreciable quantitative difference even for @xmath116 .",
    "less predictably , this qualitative similarity persists down to weak coupling .",
    "however , as @xmath31 is decreased , the energy scale for low - frequency rpa excitations rapidly deviates from that of the nn heisenberg model with @xmath117 .",
    "[ f8 ] shows the effects of gradually decreasing @xmath31 down to @xmath122 .",
    "initially , the spin - wave band is pushed to _ higher _ energy , consistent with the strengthening of nn exchange couplings and reflecting also the increasing importance of beyond - nearest neighbour couplings as shown in a recent paper @xcite . below @xmath123 , however , this band starts to migrate to _ lower _ energies , reflecting an increasing repulsion with the approaching stoner - like band .    to investigate quantitatively the spin - wave character of the excitations ,",
    "we calculate @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "the lowest excitation is of course the goldstone mode corresponding to a global spin rotation , and is a pure spin wave for all @xmath100 : @xmath126 .",
    "since excitations at the upper edge of the spin wave - like band are naturally most strongly influenced by the encroaching stoner - like band , it is found that @xmath127 for all @xmath128 .",
    "the first column of table i thus shows the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath129 . from this",
    "it is seen that for @xmath130 the excitations are predominantly spin waves  in fact for @xmath131 they are in essence pure spin waves , @xmath132 commensurate with a significant gap between the spin wave and stoner - like bands . for @xmath133 ,",
    "this gap diminishes rapidly and there is a substantial loss of spin wave character for excitations with @xmath134 .",
    "nonetheless , as is evident from the above , the low energy transverse spin excitations of the hubbard model remain predominantly spin waves for all but the lowest @xmath31 .",
    "before considering the effects of disorder on the rpa spectrum , we first briefly outline relevant properties of the inhomogeneous uhf ground state , since it is particle - hole excitations out of this state which form the basis for the rpa collective modes ; a full account of the mean - field phase diagram is given in ref . .",
    "on the introduction of disorder , uhf solutions remain ising - like , with @xmath135 .",
    "three distinct magnetic phases are found : disordered paramagnetic ( p ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) and spin glass - like ( sg ) phases . both metallic ( m ) and insulating ( i ) phases also occur , with the dominant metal - insulator transition ( mit ) m@xmath136gapless i , driven by anderson localization of single - particle states at the fermi energy @xmath45 .",
    "we now consider two specific paths across the disorder - interaction phase plane , which will be employed in the next section to illustrate the combined effects of @xmath137 and @xmath7 on the rpa transverse spin spectrum .",
    "first , consider fixing @xmath138 and varying disorder , @xmath139 .",
    "as @xmath139 is increased from zero , disorder leads to broadening and eventual overlap of the hubbard bands in the uhf single - particle spectrum , such that @xmath140 lies within a pseudogap in the total dos @xmath141 .",
    "studies of the ipr @xmath142 for single - particle states of energy @xmath143 , with @xmath144 @xcite , imply that the system passes directly from a gapped to gapless insulator in this region of the @xmath23 phase plane ( at @xmath145 ) .",
    "fig [ f5](a ) shows @xmath141 and the ipr profile @xmath146 averaged over @xmath147 site disorder realizations for @xmath148 .",
    "a pronounced pseudogap is evident in @xmath141 , in which @xmath140 lies .",

    "the chosen system size@xcite shows that fermi level states are localized : the system is a gapless mott - anderson insulator ( and remains thus with increasing @xmath139 at the chosen @xmath138 ) .",
    "analysis of the fourier transform of the local moment @xmath150 shows however that the system remains antiferromagnetically ordered : although increasingly ` dirtied ' by disorder , @xmath151 ( where the mean moment per site @xmath152 ) , with little weight at other @xmath153-vectors .",
    "note however that while the phases of the moments remain locked in af alignment , the distribution of local moment _ magnitudes _ over the sites is highly disordered .",
    "this is evident from the site - resolved distribution of local moment magnitudes , @xmath154 , with @xmath155 the number of sites with @xmath156 ; as shown in fig [ f5](b ) , again for @xmath148 .",
    "sites with energies @xmath157 , disposed randomly on the lattice , carry strong atomic - like moments , while sites with lower or higher site energies have @xmath158 , being respectively largely doubly occupied by electrons or empty . this profile is found to vary little with disorder for fixed @xmath138 , aside from minor erosion of local moment magnitudes : the primary effect of @xmath139 is to determine , via the site - energy distribution @xmath16 , the fraction of sites ( around @xmath159 ) which carry strong local moments .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ f5](b ) is a measure of the distribution of quasiparticle states of _ given _ energy @xmath160 over the sites : @xmath161 , given by@xcite    [ heps ] @xmath162 where @xmath163    is the partial density of states for sites of bare site energy @xmath164 .",
    "@xmath165 is thus the quantum probability density that electrons in fermi - level quasiparticle states will be found on sites of bare site energy @xmath164 . as discussed in ref . , and",

    "sites with strong local moments , around @xmath159 , are in turn found to contribute mainly to quasiparticle states with @xmath167 and @xmath168 , i.e. around the maxima in the single - particle spectrum .",
    "the second path considered is fixing the disorder at @xmath169 , and decreasing the scaled interaction strength @xmath31 from @xmath138 .",
    "note that , since the @xmath62 limit of the disordered hubbard model for any @xmath139 is the _ non - disordered _ af heisenberg model , decreasing @xmath31 may be thought of as effectively increasing ( by ` switching on ' ) the role of disorder .",
    "as @xmath31 is reduced , the fraction of sites at the local moment boundaries @xmath170 ) which give the dominant contribution to fermi - level states ( fig .",
    "[ f5](b)) increases .",
    "the system is ultimately driven metallic at a critical @xmath171@xcite .",
    "however , magnetic ordering remains characterized by a strong peak in @xmath172 at @xmath173 until @xmath174 , whereupon a sharp@xcite transition occurs to a spin glass - like state , with @xmath172 receiving essentially uniform @xmath175 contributions from many @xmath153 vectors ; see ref . .",
    "in this phase , although the mean local moment per site @xmath103 is typically small ( @xmath176 ) , relatively strong local moments are in fact found on a small fraction of sites with @xmath177 for a given disorder realization . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this reflects the disorder - induced production of statistically rare local environments in which atomic - like moments are not significantly eroded by electron hopping processes .",
    "we now turn to the effects of disorder on the transverse rpa excitation spectrum .",
    "the principal questions we seek to address are :    * what is the effect of disorder on the density of transverse spin excitations ? does a low - energy spin wave - like band exist for finite disorder , and what is the character of the associated excitations ?",
    "* what is the effect of disorder on the localization characteristics of low - lying collective excitations ?",
    "* what is the distribution of transverse spin excitations of given energy over the sites , and how does this relate to the inhomogeneous distribution of local moments in the mean - field ground state ?    with disorder present ,",
    "there are no simplifying symmetries which allow very large system sizes to be studied , as in the @xmath178 case .",
    "however , this lack of symmetry specifically , the absence of degeneracies in the uhf spectrum enables reasonable statistics to be gained by sampling many disorder realizations for system sizes much smaller than those required for @xmath178 .",
    "numerical evaluation of the entire transverse excitation spectrum including the stoner - like excitations remains nonetheless a large problem : a full pole search for a system of @xmath10 sites requires diagonalization of a @xmath179 matrix in the vicinity of @xmath180 poles , and is therefore @xmath181 for each disorder realization ; an ensemble of which needs subsequently to be sampled . for calculations of the full transverse spin spectrum",
    "we have thus chosen @xmath182 site systems , which are found to be sufficient for reproduction of its general features ; while for more detailed study of the low energy portion @xmath183 is employed .    for fixed disorder @xmath169 and various values of the interaction strength @xmath184 , fig .",

    "the above behaviour is clearly demonstrated : after an initial slight decrease , @xmath188 progressively increases with increasing disorder as the spin wave - like band moves to lower frequencies . note",
    "further that increasing disorder for fixed @xmath31 has a considerably less pronounced effect on the spin wave - like band than decreasing @xmath31 for fixed disorder : decreasing interaction strength shifts the maximum in the stoner - like band to lower energy ( fig .",

    "as expected , sites outside the local moment regime , which possess very small moments , do not contribute significantly to any of the low energy excitations ; rather , they participate in stoner - like excitations of significantly higher energy .",
    "the origin of the localized and delocalized low energy transverse spin excitations is then readily rationalized .",
    "sites with site energies in the range @xmath214 , which possess large local moments , contribute most significantly to single particle states within the hubbard sub - bands .",
    "since these states are the most delocalized , collective excitations involving them will likewise be delocalized . at uhf ( ` pure stoner ' )",
    "level , transverse spin excitations between single - particle states within the hubbard bands incur an energy cost of order @xmath7 ; but in the rpa spectrum , via inclusion of particle - hole correlations , this energy is renormalized down to a spin wave - like scale on the order of an exchange coupling .",
    "this is the origin of the delocalized low - energy transverse spin excitations .",
    "by contrast , sites with @xmath212 close to the local moment boundaries participate dominantly in single - particle states close to the fermi level , or an energy @xmath215 above or below it . for @xmath138",
    "such states are strongly localized , hence so too are collective excitations involving them . again , such excitations are renormalized to a low - energy scale via the particle - hole interactions inherent in the rpa . both localized and delocalized",
    "transverse spin excitations thus arise at low energies , reflecting the underlying localization characteristics of single particle states over a very wide energy range in the associated single - particle spectrum .",

    "7d is largely a consequence of sampling different disorder realizations . while the present , qualitative considerations do not of course permit identification of mobility edges in the spin wave - like band",
    ", it is at least plausible from fig . 7 that such exist .    from the above",

    "is increased , the fraction of sites in the former category decreases , leading to a shift in the peak in @xmath201 ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) to higher @xmath202 and a concomitant broadening of the distribution .",
    "the probability of sites with @xmath212 correspondingly increases , and hence localized excitations ultimately become the dominant theme .    the above discussion is confined to a region of the ( @xmath216 ) phase diagram in which the mean field ground state is an af insulator . what of the metallic af and sg phases ?",
    "fixing @xmath169 and decreasing @xmath31 progressively from @xmath138 down to @xmath217 leads ( at @xmath171 ) to a transition from an af insulator to an af metal .",
    "however , the ipr profile of the low - energy transverse spin excitations shows essentially no qualitative change from that for @xmath138 : a backbone of delocalized excitations remains present , with localized excitations superimposed at low and higher @xmath218 . in the metallic region , however , the localized excitations now arise principally from transfer of a spin between a _",
    "delocalized _ uhf state near the fermi level to a _",
    "localized _ uhf state @xmath215 above or below @xmath140 .",
    "the localized state overlaps only a few sites , while the delocalized state has weight on a finite fraction of sites .",
    "the excitation thus appears localized in the ipr profile since the on - site spin flip contribution ( which is of course the component of the excitation probed , see eq .",
    "( 2.14 ) ) can occur only from sites overlapped by the localized state .",
    "on decreasing @xmath31 further to @xmath174 , the mean field ground state becomes a sg metal . here ,",
    "the rpa and pure stoner excitation spectra appear virtually identical ( see e.g. fig .",
    "it is indeed found that the majority of low energy rpa excitations are little more than weakly renormalized stoner excitations , as expected from the low value of @xmath219 in table i. however , at very low energies ( @xmath220 ) , this is not the case . as in the af metal regime , low energy",
    "localized modes appear in the rpa spectrum , while the pure stoner spectrum at such low energies is composed of entirely delocalized modes ( since the system is metallic ) .",
    "these localized excitations are found to have dominant weight on those rare sites in the spin glass that possess substantial local moments , flips of which would incur an energy cost of @xmath215 within uhf , but occur at significantly lower energies in the rpa spectrum .",
    "in recent papers @xcite , we have described an approximate mapping of the low - frequency transverse spin excitations of the non - disordered hubbard model at finite @xmath31 , on to those of an effective underlying heisenberg model .",
    "the @xmath31-dependent effective exchange couplings are not restricted to purely nearest neighbour interactions ; they follow solely from a knowledge of the rpa excitations about the broken - symmetry uhf state at zero temperature .",
    "the mapping becomes exact as @xmath62 and , conjoined with an onsager reaction field approach , enables extraction of thermodynamic properties in the thermal paramagnetic phase .",
    "the resultant nel temperatures , spin correlation functions and magnetic susceptibilities were @xcite found to be in good agreement with quantum monte carlo calculations over a wide @xmath31-range from strong to weak coupling .",
    "we now assess the extent to which the present findings support application of such a mapping to the anderson - hubbard model .",
    "as discussed in refs , the mapping is accurate provided there is a persistent separation between low energy spin wave - like excitations and higher energy stoner - like excitations ; i.e. provided in practice a discernible spin wave - like band , comprising excitations with an appreciable degree of on - site spin flip character , is present in the full rpa transverse spin spectrum . as shown in  iii , this indeed holds for the pure hubbard model for all @xmath221 . for the anderson - hubbard model , fig .",
    "[ f10 ] and table i show that this also holds for all disorder strengths studied , at relatively large @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the mapping should certainly be accurate well within the disordered af phase of the model . on fixing disorder and reducing interaction strength towards the af  sg boundary , the spin wave character of the low - frequency band decreases significantly and the band itself is ultimately absorbed by the stoner - like portion , such that for @xmath169 the mapping would not be quantitatively accurate for @xmath222 and below . not unexpectedly ,",
    "therefore , the mapping would not be applicable to the low-@xmath31 sg phase ; but we do anticipate it to be accurate throughout the major part of the disordered af phase in the @xmath23 plane , wherein the effect of disorder on , for example , the nel temperature can be investigated .",
