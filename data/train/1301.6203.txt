    "<S> we report on the generation of a raman cascade spanning the wavelength range of 523 to 1750  nm wavelength range , in a standard telecommunication graded - index multimode optical fiber . despite the highly multimode nature of the pump , </S>",
    "<S> the raman peaks are generated in specific modes of the fiber , confirming substantial beam cleanup during the stimulated raman scattering process </S>",
    "<S> .        stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) is a well - known nonlinear process with numerous applications including optical amplifiers , tunable lasers , spectroscopy , meteorology , and optical coherence tomography . </S>",
    "<S> srs was first observed in silica glass fibers in 1972 by stolen et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they used a frequency - doubled , pulsed , nd : yag laser operating at the 532  nm wavelength to pump a single - mode optical fiber and observed stokes emission at 545  nm . </S>",
    "<S> since then , several groups have reported the observation of srs in optical fibers using various configurations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cohen and lin  @xcite generated 6 cascaded raman peaks in a silica fiber , pumped by a mode - locked , q - switched , nd : yag laser operating at 1064  nm . </S>",
    "<S> rosman  @xcite observed 15 orders of cascaded raman peaks by pumping a silica fiber at 532  nm with a frequency - doubled nd : yag laser . </S>",
    "<S> other configurations involving unconventional fibers have been used for extreme raman - comb generation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , couny et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated the generation of a raman comb spanning wavelengths from 325  nm to 2300  nm in a 1m - long hydrogen - filled hollow - core photonic crystal fiber .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the generation of new wavelengths , mediated by the srs process , in a standard graded - index multimode fiber ( gimf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gimf is pumped at a wavelength of 523  nm , and a cascade of optical - frequency raman peaks is generated on the stokes side of the pump . at high power levels the measured spectrum extends up to 1750  nm , which is the upper detection limit of our optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of such a wide wavelength range , extending from 523 to 1750  nm , using a large - core telecommunication - grade multimode fiber distinguishes our results from those carried out in small - core or highly customized optical fibers .    </S>",
    "<S> multimode optical fibers are easy to handle and are also easy to align to external sources ; however , their large core diameter is perceived as undesirable for nonlinear applications . despite a lower effective nonlinearity associated with a larger core of conventional multimode fibers , </S>",
    "<S> the multimode nature of these fibers can play an important role in some nonlinear applications . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the presence of multiple propagating modes with different dispersive properties results in expanded phase - matching opportunities for the generation of four - wave mixing ( fwm ) signals in optical fibers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gimf used in our experiments has two desirable properties that make it particularly suitable for srs generation . </S>",
    "<S> first , because the effective modal area of each mode in the gimf scales only as square root of the core area , the effective nonlinearity of some propagating modes is comparable with conventional single - mode fibers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , a relatively high @xmath0 content in the core of the standard telecommunication gimf used in our experiments results in a higher peak raman gain coefficient compared with silica - core fibers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pump used in our experiment is a frequency - doubled , q - switched , nd : ylf laser operating at 523  nm wavelength , and its 8-ns duration pulses are coupled to the input tip of the fiber using a microscope objective . </S>",
    "<S> the laser beam is not diffraction - limited , and many modes in the fiber are excited simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the gimf is a 1-km long standard , 50/125-@xmath1 m , bare fiber ( corning clearcurve om2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the output spectrum is measured using a ccs200 spectrometer ( from thorlabs ) operating in the range of 2001000  nm and a ms9740a osa ( from anritsu ) covering the 6001750  nm wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the energy of input pulses required for reaching the raman threshold immediately after coupling into the fiber ( less then 1-meter of propagation inside the gimf ) to be 20.9  @xmath1j ; we estimate the peak power to be about 2.5  kw . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse energy decreased to about 0.515  @xmath1j after 1-km of propagation , which is consistent with the expected attenuation of about 16 db / km at the pump wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the measured threshold power for the first raman peak ( @xmath2 ) is consistent with @xmath3  @xcite using the effective length of @xmath4  m ( considering the 16 db / km attenuation ) , @xmath5  m / w ( at 523  nm wavelength and considering the @xmath0 doping ) , and an effective area of @xmath6 ( considering the heavily multimode and overfilling nature of the pump ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the sequential generation of cascaded raman peaks is initiated by the pump at 523  nm . </S>",
    "<S> as the pump power is increased , the first stokes line extracts power from the pump until it becomes strong enough to seed the generation of next stokes line . </S>",
    "<S> this process continues and more and more raman peaks are generated with increasing pump power . </S>",
    "<S> the 20 cascaded peaks shown in fig .  [ fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](a ) extend from 523  nm to just above 1000  nm in wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated input peak power of our pump pulses is 22  kw for this figure .    as the pump power is further increased , even more cascaded raman peaks appear beyond the 1000  nm wavelength range of our spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](b ) shows the spectrum measured with the anritsu osa in the range of 9001750  nm at the maximum pump power level ( just below the burning threshold of fiber s input tip ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the two plots in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](a ) and  [ fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](b ) should not be compared directly because they correspond to different power levels and employ different vertical scales . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral dip at around 1300  nm and the broad peak beyond 1400  nm are two notable features in this infrared range . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the spectral dip centered at the 1320-nm wavelength is related to a reduction in the srs gain occurring near the zero - dispersion - wavelength ( zdw ) of the gimf , where the srs gain is suppressed due to a near - perfect phase - matching of the fwm process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dip at 1320  nm can be seen more clearly in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman_above_900nm_log ] , where we plot the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](b ) on a logarithmic power scale .    in our opinion , </S>",
    "<S> the broad peak centered at 1600  nm results from the onset of modulation instability in the presence of anomalous dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting short pulses can experience raman - induced spectral shifts as well as collision - based spectral broadening , resulting in a broad supercontinuum - like feature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of the longer wavelengths beyond the zdw is a very complex phenomenon and is heavily influenced by parametric processes . even in the absence of perfect phase matching , fwm can seed higher - order raman waves that are subsequently amplified through srs  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) but data plotted using a logarithmic vertical scale . </S>",
    "<S> the input pump power is just below the burning threshold of fiber s tip.,width=226 ]    the presence of efficient fwm phase - matching opportunities in the gimf impacts considerably the generation of the cascaded raman peaks . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : raman - fwm - log ] shows the spectrometer data in the frequency domain , by plotting on the horizontal axis the frequency shift of the raman comb relative to the pump frequency , and power on a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis . </S>",
    "<S> equal spacing of various peaks on the stokes side is expected for a cascaded raman process . however , the presence of fwm frequencies on the anti - stokes side of the pump is the most notable feature in this figure . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - matched frequency counterparts of these fwm idlers on the stokes side can affect the location and amplitude of the cascaded raman peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the strength of the fwm signal depended on launch conditions , and fwm was absent ( or highly suppressed ) in some of our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the highly multimode nature of the pump made it very difficult to find the optimum launch position for the generation of the anti - stokes peaks ; we needed to scan the input pump beam over the fiber core to find the point at which the anti - stokes peaks appeared with considerable power .        in order to explore the effect of fwm on the srs peaks , we offset the input pump beam by @xmath7 from the center of the fiber core . </S>",
    "<S> the pump now excites the gimf modes with different power ratios , resulting in efficient fwm in a different set of phase - matched wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a shift in the position of the spectral combs . </S>",
    "<S> the red and green spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman - shift - due - to - fwm ] are measured before and after offsetting the pump laser , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the shift seems to be seeded around the third cascaded raman peak , separated by about 50  thz from the pump frequency , which is also consistent with the location of a fwm peak in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raman - fwm - log ] . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the shift is reversed if the input pump beam is aligned back with the center of the fiber core . </S>",
    "<S> similar observations of the effect of the fwm processes on shifting the srs spectrum have been reported by sharma et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; they have shown that the cascaded raman peaks can shift depending on which modes are excited by the pump laser .        ( </S>",
    "<S> a ) and  [ fig : raman - fwm - log ] are plotted as a function of the stokes peak number . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes peak numbers 0 and 1 correspond to the pump and the first order raman peak , respectively.,width=226 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : peak - width ] , we plot the spectral width ( full width at half maximum or fwhm ) of the raman peaks from figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : raman_below_above_1000nm](a ) and  [ fig : raman - fwm - log ] as a function of the stokes peak number . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers 0 and 1 correspond to the pump and the first order raman peak , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite predicted that spectral width of each raman peak is nearly twice that of the preceding order because of the broad bandwidth of the raman gain in fused silica . </S>",
    "<S> the measured fwhm spectral widths of the pump and the first order raman peak are 1.30  thz and 2.51  thz , respectively . according to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the spectral bandwidth of the raman peak under certain conditions is nearly twice that of the pump . </S>",
    "<S> however , their analysis makes the undepleted - pump approximation and assumes an unchirped gaussian profile for the pump pulse , neither of which apply to our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the noisy nature of the srs peaks makes the analysis of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite even less applicable to the spectrum of higher - order raman peaks . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidths of higher - order raman peaks show an increasing trend as a function of their stokes peak numbers .    </S>",
    "<S> we also measured the transverse intensity profile of the output beam by a ccd camera using several bandpass color filters with a fwhm spectral bandwidth of about 10  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modeprofiles ] . the profile in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modeprofiles](a ) is measured without a color filter , and the interference of multiple modes can be clearly observed as a speckle pattern . when a color filter centered at 610  nm is placed in front of the beam fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modeprofiles](b ) , we observe a narrow round spot that appears to correspond to the spatial profile of the fundamental @xmath8 mode of our gimf . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath9 stands for laguerre - gaussian which are the eigenmodes of the gimf under the weak - guidance approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 modes can be related to the familiar notation of the @xmath11 modes commonly used for step - index fibers . </S>",
    "<S> a donut - shape spot fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modeprofiles](c ) is observed when a color filter centered at 700  nm is placed in front of the beam ; the shape and the size of the beam makes us believe that it corresponds to the lg@xmath12 mode of our fiber . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in practice , the two fold degeneracy of the lg@xmath12 mode is slightly broken to orthogonal double - lobed spatial profiles of hermite - gaussian modes  @xcite due to birefringence ( similar to the two polarization of the @xmath13 modes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the donut shape in our measurement arises when both double - lobed spatial profiles are present simultaneously , primarily due to the large bandwidth ( 10  nm ) of the color filter used for imaging the modes resulting from the incoherent combination of the orthogonal double - lobed spatial profiles .        </S>",
    "<S> spatial beam profiles corresponding to higher - order fiber modes were also seen in our experiment . as two examples , images ( d ) and ( e ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modeprofiles ] show profiles corresponding to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 modes . </S>",
    "<S> they were obtained by using optical filters with a 10-nm passband centered at 770  nm and 890  nm wavelengths , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the most notable feature we want to stress is that a gimf can be used as a device that not only shifts the pump wavelength toward the red side through srs but also performs the beam cleanup owing to the fact that different - order raman peaks generally propagate in different modes of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for the raman beam cleanup is that the lower order modes generally have a larger raman gain because of their greater overlap with the higher concentration of @xmath0 near the center of the gimf core  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of srs - induced beam cleanup in graded - index multimode optical fibers can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chiang reported similar results for higher order srs combs in a 30-m - long fiber  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , only @xmath13 mode ( corresponding to @xmath8 mode here ) was observed for a 1-km - long fiber . in our experiments , we observed higher - order modes even for a 1-km - long fiber , and beam cleanup was not at the same level reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have used a standard , telecommunication - grade , graded - index multimode fiber for srs generation by pumping it at 523  nm with 8-ns pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we observe multiple cascaded raman peaks extending up to 1300  nm . beyond that wavelength , </S>",
    "<S> the nature of dispersion changes from normal to anomalous because our fiber has its zero - dispersion wavelength near 1320  nm . at higher pump powers , in addition to the multiple cascaded raman peaks , we observe a single broadband spectral peak , extending from 1350 to 1750  nm . </S>",
    "<S> its origin appears to be related to the formation of solitons through modulation instability , intrapulse raman scattering , as well as collision - based spectral broadening . </S>",
    "<S> such features have been observed in the past for single - mode fibers or few - mode step - index fibers ( see , e.g. , mussot et al.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments show that a supercontinuum can also form in a highly multimode telecommunication - grade , graded - index multimode fiber </S>",
    "<S> . the multimode nature of the fiber can also be useful from a practical standpoint . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we observed that different spectral peaks have spatial patterns that correspond to different fiber modes . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can be useful for beam cleanup . </S>",
    "<S> future efforts will focus on extending the spectrum to the infrared region and on stabilizing the frequency and power of individual comb lines for practical applications . </S>"
