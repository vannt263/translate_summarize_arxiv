    ", these planets are probably ice giants roughly similar in structure to uranus and neptune in the solar system .",
    "@xcite proposes that these planets form in two stages .",
    "after a disk instability produces a gas giant , photoevaporation of the gas giant atmosphere leaves behind an icy core with @xmath0 1020 @xmath1 .",
    "this mechanism requires a massive disk to initiate the instability and a nearby o - type star to photoevaporate the gas giant atmosphere .",
    "@xcite notes that this process should yield ( i ) super - earths around m dwarfs formed in rich star clusters and ( ii ) gas giants around m dwarfs formed in low mass stellar associations .",
    "@xcite suggest that super - earths favor coagulation models , where collisions of 110 km objects eventually produce icy planets with @xmath0 10 @xmath1 at 110 au .",
    "although numerical calculations appear to preclude gas giants at 110 au around m dwarfs @xcite , there has been no demonstration that coagulation produces icy planets on reasonable timescales in a disk around an m dwarf .    here ,",
    "we develop a semi - analytic coagulation model , and show that contraction of the central star along a pre - main sequence ( pms ) hayashi track sets the initial conditions for planet formation around low mass stars .",
    "our results indicate that icy protoplanets with @xmath0 0.11@xmath1 form in @xmath5 0.11myr at 14au . over 50500myr",
    ", collisions between protoplanets produce super - earths with masses similar to those detected in microlensing surveys .",
    "we start with the motivation for our study in  [ sec : motivation ] , discuss the coagulation model of planet formation and the moving snow line in  [ sec : snowline ] , develop the disk evolution model in  [ sec : evolution ] , and apply the model to super - earth formation in  [ sec : superearths ] .",
    "we end with a brief summary in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to motivate our study , we contrast planet formation around low mass stars and solar - type stars . for solar - type stars approaching the main sequence ,",
    "the luminosity is roughly constant on typical planet formation timescales of 10100myr .",
    "thus , the conditions where planets form change little with time . for stars with masses @xmath6 , however , the luminosity fades by a factor of 10100 on the hayashi track . because the inner disk radius is ` locked ' at a fixed distance relative to the radius of the central star , the inner disk contracts as the star contracts . during this evolution",
    ", the ` snow line '  the point that separates the inner region of rocky planet formation from the outer region of icy planet formation  also moves inward .",
    "coupled with the evolution of the inner disk , the moving snow line produces a dramatic variation in the surface density at fixed distances from the central star .",
    "this behavior enables the rapid formation of icy protoplanets . as the low mass star approaches the main sequence ,",
    "these protoplanets collide and merge into super - earths with properties similar to those detected in recent microlensing experiments .",
    "in coagulation models , planets grow from repeated collisions and mergers of small objects in a circumstellar disk @xcite . when 110  km ` planetesimals ' form and start to grow , dynamical friction damps the orbital eccentricities of the largest objects .",
    "damping yields large gravitational cross - sections and leads to ` runaway growth , ' where the largest objects grow fastest and run away from more slowly growing smaller objects @xcite .",
    "throughout the runaway , the largest protoplanets stir up the leftover planetesimals . eventually , the leftovers have orbital velocity dispersions comparable to the escape velocities of the largest protoplanets . because gravitational cross - sections fall as velocity dispersions rise , runaway growth ends .",
    "the ensemble of planetesimals and protoplanets then enters ` oligarchic ' growth , where the largest objects  oligarchs  accrete at rates roughly independent of their size @xcite .    during oligarchic growth ,",
    "protoplanets become isolated from their surroundings .",
    "if an oligarch accretes all of the mass in an annulus with width @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hill radius , its isolation mass is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the orbital semi - major axis and @xmath11 is the mass surface density of solid material in the disk . if @xmath12 is the mass density of a solid object the timescale to reach isolation is @xcite @xmath13 in the solar system , oligarchic growth has two regimes . for @xmath14au , planetesimals are rocky because volatile materials remain in the gas . in the ` minimum mass solar nebula ' with @xmath15 , @xmath16g@xmath17 , and @xmath18g@xmath19 at 1au , @xmath200.1@xmath1 .",
    "once oligarchs contain @xmath550% of the total mass in solids , their mutual dynamical interactions lead to ` chaotic ' growth @xcite , where collisions between oligarchs eventually produce earth - mass planets .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that @xmath51020 oligarchs collide to form a typical earth - mass planet in @xmath510100 myr at 1au around a solar - type star @xcite .    outside the ` snow line '",

    "* ) .    for solar - type stars ,",
    "planet formation is fairly independent of stellar evolution . throughout most of the pms phase ,",

    "thus , the position of the snow line ",
    "@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the stellar luminosity and @xmath27 is the temperature where water and other volatile materials condense out of the gas  is roughly stationary in time .",
    "because the @xmath50.11myr formation time for planetesimals and oligarchs is short compared to the @xmath510myr pms lifetime , the separation between icy and rocky ( proto)planets remains fairly distinct , evident in the composition of different populations in the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "although there is some mixing between water - rich and water - poor regions @xcite , most of chaotic growth occurs when the sun lies close to the main sequence at nearly constant @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast with solar - type stars , stellar evolution is a crucial feature that defines the nature of newly - formed planets around low mass stars .",
    "because the timescale for planetesimal and oligarch formation is short compared to the 0.11gyr pms contraction time , the timing of planetesimal formation sets the nature of icy / rocky planets with distance from a low mass star . on its hayashi track ,",
    "the luminosity of a 0.25@xmath28 star fades by a factor of several hundred at roughly constant effective temperature . during this period ,",
    "@xmath29 moves inward by a factor of @xmath51520 .",

    "however , when pms stars actively accrete from a circumstellar disk , magnetic interactions between the star and the disk appear to ` lock ' the inner disk radius @xmath32 at a fixed distance relative to the stellar radius , @xmath33 , at several myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the duration of this phase is not well - constrained , the observed change in @xmath34 for disks around solar - type stars is a factor of @xmath353 @xcite .",
    "if disks around low mass stars remain locked for the entire pms phase , the maximum decrease in the inner disk radius is a factor of @xmath51520 .",
    "this change is much larger than the observed variation of @xmath34 ; thus we assume @xmath34 = constant . to conserve mass and angular momentum , @xmath11 and the outer disk radius must evolve , which impacts @xmath30 and the formation timescales for oligarchs and planets .    to construct a model for disk evolution ,",
    "we adopt @xmath36 where @xmath37 is in units of solar radii , @xmath38g@xmath19 , and @xmath39 is the radial distance from the star in au . setting the scale factor @xmath40 yields the usual @xmath11(mmsn ) for a 1@xmath28 star at 1myr , when a large fraction of the solid mass in the terrestrial zone of the solar system is in large bodies .",

    "this material coats the growing oligarchs , leftover planetesimals , and the surrounding debris with an icy veneer that may extend the oligarchic growth phase and produce more massive oligarchs . for @xmath592au ,",
    "ice condensation reduces @xmath31 by a factor @xmath5 3 ( eq.[eq : tiso ] ) , which enables the rapid formation of icy oligarchs well before the central star reaches the main sequence .",
