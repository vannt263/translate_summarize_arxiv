    "the assumed value is around @xmath187 e / nm@xmath148 , which corresponds to @xmath188 .",
    "this parameter value is clearly beyond the validity range of perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , one can use numerics .",
    "given the approximate , reduced character of the studied 1d - poisson - nernst - planck model , the semi - quantitative agreement between the theory and the experiment is quite satisfactory .",
    "indeed , the agreement is rather satisfactory for not too large currents , @xmath189 na .",
    "the simplest explanation for the discrepancy occurring for strong currents could be the violation of the condition of a local equilibrium in the transverse direction ( see sec",
    ". one - dimensional model reduction ) .",
    "then , this breakdown of the 1d description would be similar in nature to the one observed for diffusive transport of biased , non - interacting particles @xcite . to fully justify this statement",

    "@xcite to find the different time scales characterizing the problem , i.e. the time scale for diffusion in the transverse direction and the time scale associated with the drift of the @xmath33-th ion along the axial direction . by comparison of this two time scales one could find out whether transported ions have enough time to relax in the transversal direction .",
    "however , in the present , more complicated situation the proposed consideration results in a very rough and somewhat vague estimation ( because of a heterogeneous distribution of the ions and the corresponding electrical field along the pore ) . for better agreement a 3-d pnp modeling",
    "would be called for .",
    "such a 3d pnp study , would in natural way , reveal the dependence of the electric potential on the radial coordinate @xmath60 , and , in turn , a heterogeneous distribution of ions in the transverse direction , contrary to the model assumptions in eq .",
    "( [ constant ] ) .",
    "clearly , the larger is the surface charge density , the stronger will be the violation of these model assumptions .",
    "because of a negatively charged channel wall , the positive ions should adhere to it forming an electrical double - layer of the width @xmath190 with an exponentially enhanced concentration of cations . a physical criterion to disregard this complexity",
    "can be obtained by demanding that the electrostatic energy per ion near the channel wall ( in the absence of external voltage ) , @xmath191 , is smaller than @xmath192 . for @xmath193 and @xmath194",
    "nm this yields @xmath195 e / nm@xmath148 . for higher surface charge densities ( like in the experiment )",
    "not only the homogeneity assumptions become increasingly violated , but also the surface current contributions @xcite can not be neglected .",
    "these effects are beyond our description within a 1d - pnp reduction . moreover , for higher concentrations @xmath196 m the ion - size effects become important @xcite implying the presence of ion correlations .",
    "this goes beyond the mean field description . to summarize",
    ", a numerical study of the full three - dimensional set - up would be helpful in order to distinguish between the principal shortcomings of the pnp approach and the failure of our 1d reduction for large currents and/or high surface charge densities .",
    "in particular , the overall failure of the pnp approach can be due to formation of the stern layer of condensed counter - ions on the pore wall @xcite .",
    "such a layer will screen and renormalize ( i.e. decrease ) the surface charge density `` seen '' by other mobile ions , thus reducing the `` volume '' rectification effect . a proper treatment of the surface current rectification effects in such a layer would bring about the theme of strong correlations in the ionic transport which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in this paper we provided an analytical treatment of the problem of current rectification by artificial conical nanopores made in synthetic membranes of about submicron - to - micron width . within a one - dimensional reduction of the original three - dimensional problem ,",
    "we have derived 1d - pnp equations , cf .",
    "( 12)-(14 ) , which incorporate both the entropic effects and the charge density renormalization due to the variable diameter of the tube .",
    "these equations generalize the 1d - pnp equations in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of pores of a variable diameter .",
    "furthermore , we provided a singular perturbation treatment of the problem of ion conductance and rectification within the reduced 1d - pnp description implementing rigorous boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "our theory applies to nanopores with lengths exceeding largely the debye length and the pore diameter .",
    "the developed theory corresponds precisely to the experiments done by siwy et al . @xcite .",
    "the validity range of perturbation theory requires , however , that the channel wall is charged weakly .",
    "then , it agrees well with the numerical solution of the 1d - pnp problem for charge densities up to @xmath197 e / nm@xmath148 .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental charge densities are much larger , about @xmath198 e / nm@xmath148 . here the perturbation theory fails .",
    "however , the 1d - pnp equations can be integrated numerically and the obtained numerical solutions provide a good agreement with the experimental data by siwy et al .",
    "@xcite for sufficiently small currents .",
    "moreover , we quantify the rectification properties of conical nanopores . in the lowest order perturbation theory we obtained analytic formulas for the rectification - current @xmath199 and the rectification measure @xmath2 ,",
    "( [ rectification ] ) .",
    "the latter measure clearly indicates that the rectification property is caused by the difference in the volume charge density of the fixed charges . in other words , the rectification is due to an asymmetry in the potential jumps at the channel ends .",
    "a discrepancy between the experiment and the 1d - pnp modeling for large positive voltages most likely indicates the violation of the condition of local equilibrium in the transverse direction at strong currents , cf .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for this reason ,",
    "the description within the 1d - pnp modeling breaks down and a full 3d - pnp treatment becomes necessary .",
