    "the set @xmath233 intersects @xmath207 in a set of area @xmath234 by lemma  [ lem : areainrounddomain ] , and areas in @xmath226 are distorted by a factor of no more than the square of the derivative .",
    "this implies that @xmath235 as claimed .",
    "[ lem : thinrootssummary ] let @xmath236 and consider the annulus @xmath237 defined as in lemma  [ lem : areainfundamentaldomain ] . choose a probability @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath238 points are randomly and independently distributed in @xmath237 , then for any polynomial @xmath15 , each thin root has at least one of these points in its immediate basin with probability at least @xmath23 .",
    "the area of all channels within @xmath237 of any fixed thin root is at least @xmath239 by lemma  [ lem : areainfundamentaldomain ] , and @xmath240 by lemma  [ lem : area ] .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the area of @xmath237 is less than @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , the probability that a point chosen randomly in @xmath237 will lie in one of the channels of this root is at least @xmath242 now , suppose that we distribute some ( large ) number @xmath243 of points on the annulus @xmath237 , randomly and independently .",
    "then the probability that we do _ not _ hit one of the channels of some fixed thin root will be at most @xmath244 . since there are at most @xmath1 thin roots , the probability that there is some thin root the channels of which are not hit is at most @xmath245 .",
    "we need to make @xmath243 large enough so that @xmath246 , hence we need @xmath247 .    since @xmath248 , we have @xmath249 so it suffices to distribute this number of points within the annulus at random so that , with probability at least @xmath23 , at least one channel of each thin root is hit .",
    "[ rem : r ] increasing the radius @xmath86 will decrease the necessary number of points to asymptotically @xmath250 for large @xmath86 .",
    "the disadvantage is that the required number of iterations will be very large until the roots are reached . in this article",
    ", we do not optimize the number of starting points vs.  the number of iterations : indeed , it is possible to optimize all constants by refining several of our estimates ( see below ) .",
    "we have to distribute @xmath251 points within the annulus @xmath96 by the algorithm described in section [ sec : thick ] to be sure that all thick roots are found .",
    "to hit the thin roots , we consider the annulus @xmath237 defined as in lemma [ lem : areainfundamentaldomain ] , where we choose @xmath252 ( see remark [ rem : r ] ) so that @xmath253 ; in order to hit find all the thin roots with probability at least @xmath254 , we thus have to randomly distribute @xmath255 points inside the annulus @xmath237 ( in both statements , we ignored the condition that we need to round up certain numbers ) .",
    "this gives us a total of @xmath256 points to be chosen to hit the channels of all roots with probability at least @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , setting @xmath257 , it suffices to use at least @xmath258 points .",
    "[ rem : smallvalues ] strictly speaking , this proof only works for @xmath259 as we claimed in the beginning that @xmath260 and finally chose @xmath261 however , we only need this to simplify some term in the proof of lemma [ lem : area ] ; for @xmath262 , by being a little bit more careful in the proof of lemma [ lem : area ] one can even get slightly better constants , whereas for @xmath263 one has to choose another value for @xmath65 to get the same final upper bound .",
    "[ higherprob ] of course , the probability @xmath18 can be replaced by any probability @xmath20 by appropriately increasing the number of points . for @xmath62 , the number of points to find",
    "the thin roots then becomes @xmath264 .",
    "including thick roots as well , and ignoring dominated terms , the total number of points becomes @xmath265 this will not even change the leading term of the number of points as long as @xmath266 .    at several places",
    ", we preferred the simple argument over optimal numerical values , as far as constant factors were concerned .",
    "if one were to optimize these factors , it would involve the following places .",
    "the thick roots have the higher complexity , so asymptotically it is most important to optimize constants here . in lemma  [ lem :",
    "universalgeometry ] , the modulus of a quadrilateral is estimated only roughly using a simple argument .",
    "the precise value of this quadrilateral can be determined using elliptic integrals ; this has been done in @xcite in an analogous situation .",
    "one could then optimize the number of circles and the number of points on them : taking more ( or fewer ) circles would allow us to use fewer ( more ) points on each of them , and there is an optimal value of circles that minimizes the total number of points .    for thin roots , we used the estimate @xmath267 at the end of the proof of lemma  [ lem : area ] , and for large @xmath1 this loses a factor of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , in the proof of lemma  [ lem : thinrootssummary ] one could gain a factor of @xmath122 by using a fixed probability @xmath23 , rather than @xmath254 .",
    "finally , there is a certain loss in the estimation of probabilities of hitting the @xmath1 different basins ; these probabilities are not quite additive as estimated .",
    "our estimates in the thin case are roughly a factor @xmath268 away from being optimal .",
    "and of course , one can reduce the radius @xmath86 of the starting points , and thus the required number of iterations , at the expense of increasing the number of starting points .    since the complexities of the deterministic and the probabilistic parts are different , it is tempting to reduce the total complexity by choosing a value of @xmath65 different from @xmath269 so that both partial complexities become closer to each other .",
    "slight improvements are indeed possible that way , but the gain seems to be minimal .",
    "for example , one has @xmath270 in this case , the deterministic term is still much bigger than the probabilistic one .",
    "such calculations seem to become much more complicated with relatively little gain .",
