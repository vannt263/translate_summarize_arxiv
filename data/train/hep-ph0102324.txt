    "recently the brookhaven experiment e821 made a precise determination of the muon anomaly @xmath16 and found a deviation from the standard model result at the @xmath17 level .",
    "the experiment finds@xcite a_^exp - a_^sm=43(16)10 ^ -10 a correction to @xmath18 is expected in supersymmetric models@xcite and a realistic analysis of the correction to @xmath18 was given in the supergravity unified model with gravity mediated breaking of supersymmetry in refs.@xcite . specifically in the analysis of ref.@xcite",
    "it was pointed out that the supersymmetric electro - weak correction to @xmath18 could be as large or larger than the standard model electro - weak correction@xcite .",
    "the fact that the supersymmetric electro - weak contribution to @xmath18 can be large is supported by several later works which include constraints of the unification of the gauge coupling constants using the high precision lep data , radiative breaking of the electro - weak symmetry , experimental bounds on sparticle masses and relic density constraints on neutralino dark matter assuming r parity conservation@xcite . soon after the release of data@xcite on the observation of a difference between the experimental value and the theoretical prediction of @xmath18 in the standard model several analyses appeared [ 9 - 17 ] both within the supersymmetric framework [ 9 - 15 ] as well as in non - supersymmetric scenarios@xcite .",
    "specifically the work of ref.@xcite used a @xmath19 error corridor on @xmath20 where @xmath21 to constrain susy , i.e. , 10.610 ^ -10 < a_^susy<76.210 ^ -10 where the error corridor also includes uncertainties due to hadronic error@xcite in the theoretical predictions .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite showed the interesting result that the bnl data implies that the sparticles have upper limits which lie within reach of the planned accelerator experiments .",
    "thus , for example , one finds that within the minimal sugra model@xcite the bnl constraint implies that the lighter chargino mass @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 tev ( @xmath25 ) consistent with the fine tuning criteria@xcite .",
    "these mass ranges are within reach of the lhc and a part of the parameter space may also be accessible at runii of the tevatron .",
    "further , it was shown that the bnl data implies that @xmath26 is positive using the standard sign convention@xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental @xmath27 constraint that eliminates much of the parameter space for the case when @xmath28@xcite .",
    "it was also discussed in ref.@xcite that the effects from extra dimensions@xcite on @xmath0 are typically very small and do not pose a serious background to the supersymmetric electro - weak contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis carried out in ref.@xcite was under the assumption of cp conservation where the phases of all the soft susy parameters are set to zero . however , in general the soft breaking parameters can be complex and their presence brings in new sources of cp violation over and above the one in the ckm matrix of the standard model",
    ". the normal size of the phases is o(1 ) which creates a problem in that phases of this size typically lead to the electric dipole moment for the electron and for the neutron which are in excess of the experimental limits@xcite .",
    "some of the possible ways to avert this disaster consist of assuming small phases@xcite , assuming that the sparticle spectrum is heavy@xcite and more recently the possibility that there are cancellations@xcite which allows for large phases and a not too heavy sparticle mass spectrum .",
    "for the last scenario one will have then large cp violating phases which would affect a variety of low energy physics , such as sparticle masses and decays , higgs mixing , proton decay , b physics and baryogenesis .",
    "thus the inclusion of cp phases is an important new ingredient in susy phenomenology .",
    "now @xmath7 also depends on the cp phases and thus the experimental constraints on @xmath7 can be translated into constraints on the cp phases .",
    "a full analysis of the effects of cp phases on @xmath0 in the minimal n=1 supergravity and in mssm was given in ref.@xcite .",
    "remarkably it is found that the cp phases strongly affect @xmath7 in that they can change both its sign and its magnitude .",
    "it is this fact , i.e. , that the @xmath7 is a very sensitive function of the cp phases that leads us to utilize the current bnl data to constrain the cp phases .",
    "the phases that enter most dominantly in the @xmath0 analysis are @xmath1 and @xmath3 and one finds that the bnl constraint eliminates a big chunk of the parameter space in the @xmath6 plane . the domains allowed and disallowed by the bnl data depend sensitively on @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and less sensitively on other parameters ( here @xmath29 is the universal soft breaking mass for the scalar fields , @xmath30 is the universal gaugino mass , and @xmath32 where @xmath33 gives mass to the up quark and @xmath34 gives mass to the down quark and the lepton ) .",
    "often as much @xmath5 of the area in the @xmath6 plane is excluded by the bnl constraint . in the limit of vanishing phases",
    "the allowed region reduces to the constraint @xmath35 which was deduced in the earlier analysis@xcite under the constraint of cp conservation .",
    "of course , not all the parameter space allowed by the @xmath0 constraint is allowed by the edm constraints .",
    "however , we find that these constraints can be mutually consistent . thus we give examples of models where the phases are large , ie .",
    ", o(1 ) , the edm constrains are satisfied and the contribution to @xmath20 is consistent with the new physics signal seen in the precise bnl measurement .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 we give some of the basic formulae which enter into the @xmath0 analysis with cp violation . in sec.3",
    "we give a discussion of the numerical results obtained by imposing the constraint of eq.(2 ) .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.4",
    "@xmath20 at the one loop level arises from the chargino exchange and from the neutralino exchange .",
    "the chargino contribution is typically the dominant one although the neutralino contribution can become very significant in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "in fact the neutralino exchange contribution is central in determining the boundary of the allowed and the disallowed region in the plane of the cp violating phases on which @xmath20 sensitively depends . to define notation and explain the main features of the analysis we exhibit below the cp phase dependent chargino contribution and the reader is referred to the ref.@xcite for the full analytic analysis including the neutralino exchange contribution . the chargino mass matrix with cp phases is given by    m_c= ( ) where we have absorbed the phases of the higgs sector by field redefinitions . in eq.(3 )",
    "@xmath1 is the phase of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the phase of the su(2 ) gaugino mass @xmath4",
    ". the chargino mass matrix can be diagonalized by the biunitary transformation @xmath36 where u and v are unitary matrices .",
    "the chargino contribution is given by@xcite a^^+_=a^1^+_+a^2^+ _ where a^1^+ _ = _",
    "i=1 ^ 2re ( _ u^*_i2v^*_i1 ) f_3 ( ) . and",
    "a^2^+ _ = _ i=1 ^ 2 ( | _ u^*_i2|^2+|v_i1|^2 ) f_4 ( ) . here",
    "@xmath37=@xmath38@xmath39 , @xmath40=@xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite the entire phase dependence of the chargino contribution to @xmath18 resides in the combination @xmath44 .",
    "the neutralino contribution , however , depends on additional phases and one can choose these additional combinations to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the phase of the u(1 ) gaugino mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the phase of the universal parameter @xmath50 of trilinear soft susy breaking term in the scalar potential .",
    "we want to analyze the effect of the constraint of eq.(2 ) on the cp phases on which @xmath7 sensitively depends .",
    "we shall work in the region of the parameter space where sparticle masses are of moderate size and cp phases are o(1 ) . in this region",
    "one can manufacture an @xmath7 of the size of the new physics effect indicated by the bnl experiment .",
    "however , since the sparticle masses are moderate size and the phases are o(1 ) we need the cancellation mechanism to achieve consistency with the edm constraints . for the purpose of the analysis we shall use the parameter space discussed in ref.@xcite which consists of the parameters : @xmath29 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 , @xmath31 , @xmath1 , @xmath47 , @xmath3 and @xmath52 where @xmath47 is phase of the u(1 ) gaugino mass @xmath48 , and @xmath52 is the phase of su(3 ) gaugino mass @xmath53 .",
    "the electro - weak sector of the model does not involve the susy qcd phase @xmath52 which , however , enters in the edm analysis of the neutron .",
    "the neutralino exchange contribution depends also on @xmath47 and @xmath54 in addition to its dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the dependence of the sum of both contributions on @xmath47 and @xmath54 is weak .",
    "thus mainly the phases strongly constrained by the brookhaven experiment are @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "in fig.1 we display the allowed parameter space in the @xmath6 plane in the range @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the specific input values of @xmath29 , @xmath51 , @xmath31 , @xmath50 , @xmath54 and @xmath47 as given in the caption of fig.1 .",
    "as discussed in sec.2 , the chargino exchange contribution to @xmath7 is a function only of the combination @xmath44 .",
    "this means that in the part of the parameter space where the chargino contribution is dominant a value of @xmath44 allowed by the bnl constraint will generate a @xmath57 line in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "similarly a range of allowed values of @xmath44 will generate an area at @xmath57 incline and we see that is approximately true in fig.1 .",
    "now , of course , if the chargino contribution was the sole contribution in @xmath7 fig.1 would consist of only parallel lines at @xmath57 incline within the allowed range of @xmath44 consistent with eq.(2 ) .",
    "however , @xmath7 also contains the neutralino exchange contribution which is strongly dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath1 individually even when @xmath44 is fixed .",
    "the strong dependence of the neutralino contribution on @xmath3 when @xmath44 is fixed is shown in fig.2 . because of this the sum of the chargino and the neutralino contributions does not possess the simple dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the sum form . thus in fig.1",
    "the boundaries at @xmath57 are not exactly straight lines since near the boundary the neutralino contribution can move @xmath7 in or out of the allowed range admitting or eliminating that point in the parameter space of the admissible set . further , since the neutralino contribution violates the simple dependence on @xmath44 it destroys the translational invariance of @xmath7 on @xmath1 ( with @xmath44 fixed )",
    ". we see this violation in fig.1 from the asymmetrical endings of the allowed region , i.e. , the lower right hand and the upper left hand of the admissible region , are not mirror reflections of each other .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath51 and @xmath29 also have a strong effect on @xmath18 .",
    "we study the effect of changes in these below .    to study the effect of the dependence on @xmath31 we carry out an analysis in fig.3 similar to that of fig.(1 ) but with @xmath58 and with all other parameters fixed at their values in fig.1 .",
    "now as pointed out in refs.@xcite @xmath7 has a strong dependence on @xmath31 . as shown in the first paper of ref.@xcite this dependence arises from the chiral interference term in the chargino exchange contribution which is proportional to @xmath31 for large @xmath31 .",
    "thus a reduction in the value of @xmath31 reduces the magnitude of @xmath7 and its relative smallness results in a smaller range in @xmath44 around @xmath59 consistent with eq.(2 ) .",
    "further , since the magnitude of @xmath7 is smaller and closer to the lower limit of eq.(2 ) it is more sensitive to the neutralino exchange contributions which can move it out of the allowed region more easily reducing the allowed region in the @xmath6 plane which is what we see in fig.3 .",
    "next we study the effect of changing the value of @xmath51 .",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath51 increases the chargino mass and the neutralino mass which reduces the magnitude of @xmath7 .",
    "the reduction in the magnitude of @xmath7 leads to a smaller range for @xmath44 which is what we see in fig.4 relative to fig.1 .",
    "finally we look at the effect of the variation of @xmath29 on @xmath7 . now similar to the effect of increasing @xmath51 , an increase in the value of @xmath29 decreases the overall magnitude of @xmath7 bringing it closer to the bnl lower limit as given by eq.(2 ) . as in the analysis of figs.3 and fig.4 the fact that the overall magnitude of @xmath7 is smaller means that changes in the phase can more easily move its value out of the bnl admissible domain thus reducing the allowed range of @xmath44 .",
    "this is what we see in fig.5 where @xmath60 gev .",
    "the same argument would indicate that a further increase in the value of @xmath29 should further decrease the allowed range of @xmath44 which is what we find in fig.6 where @xmath61 gev .",
    "we note that @xmath7 is more sensitive to changes in @xmath30 than in @xmath29 .",
    "this was seen already in the analysis of ref.@xcite where the upper limit of @xmath29 was found to be significantly larger than the upper limit on @xmath30 .",
    "the above explains why the allowed area in fig.4 is smaller than in figs.5 and 6 .",
    "this is so because in fig.4 @xmath30 is close to its upper limit while is figs.4 and 5 @xmath29 is significantly lower than its upper limit .",
    "we notice also that the allowed regions in figs . 5 and 6 consist of complete straight lines which means that the neutralino contribution role here is suppressed severely by increasing @xmath29 .",
    "now not all the parameter space admissible by the @xmath0 constraint in figs",
    ". 1 - 6 is admissible by the constraints on the electron and on the neutron edm . to satisfy the edm constraints via the cancellation mechanism we have to utilize also the parameter @xmath52 along with @xmath1 , @xmath3 and other soft parameters .",
    "( we include the two loop effects of ref.@xcite in the analysis . ) . in table 1",
    "we exhibit five points ( a - e ) that lie in each of the allowed regions of fig.1 and figs . 3 - 6 ,",
    "i.e. , point ( a ) lies in the allowed region of fig .",
    "1 , point ( b ) lies in the allowed region of fig",
    ". 3 etc , which satisfy the edm constraints and the corresponding value of @xmath7 lies in the bnl range of eq.(2 ) .",
    "thus table 1 gives five models which have large cp violating phases , their contributions to the edm of the electron and of the neutron lie within experimental limits using the cancellation mechanism and they produce a susy contribution to @xmath0 consistent with the signal observed by the bnl experiment .",
    "the sparticle spectrum corresponding to cases ( a - e ) of table 1 is shown in table 2 .",
    "one finds that in all the cases the sparticle spectrum is low enough that some if not all of the sparticles must become visible at the lhc , and in some cases the sparticle spectrum is low enough to even lie within reach of runii of the tevatron .",
    "we note that using points of table 1 one can generate trajectories using the scaling technique given in ref.@xcite where the edm constraints are satisfied and thus one can use this technique to produce many more models of the type discussed above .",
    ".cases where the edm and the g-2 experiments are satisfied [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have used the new physics signal seen by the brookhaven g-2 experiment and the recently derived cp phase dependent analytic results on the supersymmetric electro - weak correction to @xmath0 to put limts on the explicit cp violating phases that arise from the soft susy breaking sector of mssm . using a 2 @xmath62 error corridor around the observed effect",
    "we find that the bnl constraint excludes a large region in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "the amount of the region excluded depends sensitively of @xmath31 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and less sensitively on the remaining parameters . in most of the parameter space",
    "the excluded region is as much as @xmath5 of the total area , i.e. , the area mapped by @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in the limit when the phases vanish the allowed region limits to the case @xmath35 deduced in the previous analysis using cp conservation@xcite .",
    "we also show that the regions allowed by the bnl constraint contains points where the cancellation mechanism operates and provide examples of models with large cp violation consistent with the experimental edm limits of the electron and the neutron and with susy contributions to @xmath18 consistent with the new physics signal seen by the bnl experiment .",
    "these models also possess sparticle spectra which lie within reach of collider experiments planned for the near future .",
