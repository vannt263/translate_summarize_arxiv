    "<S> the equivalence of these equations defined in two different dimensions is quite unexpected , but if one realizes that large @xmath1 limit of the @xmath2 lie algebra is just the lie algebra of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of an auxiliary 2 dimensional surface@xcite , and that the equations of motion of @xmath3-valued non - linear sigma models in 2 dimensions are in fact partial differential equations on 4 dimensional space , then one might be more comfortable with the idea of describing 4 dimensional self - dual einstein s gravity as a limit of a certain class of 2 dimensional field theories , and can show that the two theories are in fact identical . this correspondence is supported further by the observation that the plebaski equation and the @xmath2-valued 2-dimensional non - linear sigma models are both integrable .    one may be interested in extending this idea of describing 3 + 1 dimensional theories from 1 + 1 dimensional perspective without the self - dual restriction and in the lorentzian regime . </S>",
    "<S> there are several advantages of such a description , if it is possible at all . </S>",
    "<S> they stem from the fact that 1 + 1 dimensional field theories are usually more manageable than 3 + 1 dimensional ones , both classically and quantum mechanically . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a number of field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions are renormalizable , due to the _ dimensionlessness _ of field variables in a naive power counting . </S>",
    "<S> there would be an enormous gain if one ever succeeds in describing the einstein s gravitation in 3 + 1 dimensions as a limit of some kind of 1 + 1 dimensional field theories which eventually proves to be renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> this idea sounds strange but does not seem impossible , since the renormalizability is highly sensitive to the spacetime dimensions on which the theories are defined </S>",
    "<S> .    these reasonings led us to seek the possibility whether the einstein s gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions without the self - dual restriction is describable as a 1 + 1 dimensional field theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea was simply to split a 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime into a 1 + 1 dimensional base manifold and a 2 dimensional fibre space , and write down the einstein - hilbert action . </S>",
    "<S> then the einstein - hilbert action becomes 1 + 1 dimensional field theory action , where the infinite dimensional group of diffeomorphisms of 2 dimensional fibre space becomes the yang - mills gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> but this program was successful only in a formal sense , since the resulting 1 + 1 dimensional action did not seem much useful , which made the whole idea of describing the einstein s gravitation as 1 + 1 dimensional field theory questionable . </S>",
    "<S> the follow - up idea was to use the gauge freedom of the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if one chooses one of the spacetime coordinates as the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic , then it turns out that the 1 + 1 dimensional field theory description of the einstein s gravitation is simplified significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to present several unexpected results that i obtained in the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle description of the einstein s gravitation , and discuss their physical implications . </S>",
    "<S> first , i will present quasi - local balance equations of energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum for an arbitrary compact two - surface , which are just two - surface integrals of the four divergence - type equations that are part of the einstein s equations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quasi - local energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum are expressed in the coordinate - independent and geometric way in terms of the area of a two - surface and the in- and out - going null vector fields at each point of that surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are bondi - like , since their rates of changes are given by fluxes of the canonical form@xcite t_0^ ~_i _ i _ q^i , where @xmath4 is an appropriate vector field defined at each point of a two - surface .    </S>",
    "<S> second , problems of defining quasi - local angular momentum and associated rotational energy have been particularly subtle issues@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the very notion of rotation depends on the choice of the coordinates , which implies that one can always remove the effects of rotation by working in a co - rotating coordinate system . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to demand that the angular momentum and the rotational energy of any compact two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime be zero . </S>",
    "<S> it will be seen that our quasi - local angular momentum and rotational energy not only become zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime , but also reduce to the standard values of the total angular momentum and the _ carter s constant _ in the asymptotic region of the kerr spacetime , respectively@xcite . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , our quasi - local rotational energy may be regarded as a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant of a generic gravitational field .    </S>",
    "<S> third , using the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic as the time coordinate , i will write down the hamiltonian of the einstein s theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i will obtain the hamilton s equations of motion from this hamiltonian using appropriate boundary conditions , which determine the time flows of the field variables . </S>",
    "<S> together with the quasi - local balance equations ( or the constraint equations depending on the signature of the 3-dimensional hypersurface ) , it will be seen that the hamilton s equations of motion constitute the full einstein s equations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , i will present a simple but general relation between quasi - local energy - flux and angular momentum - flux of a generic gravitational radiation that has no isometries . </S>",
    "<S> it is a generalization of the well - known relation of mass - loss and angular momentum - loss@xcite , = m_zl_z [ algae ] for small perturbations around a stationary and axi - symmetric spacetime , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the frequency and azimuthal angular momentum of the perturbations , respectively . to my knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> such a relation between these gravitational fluxes of the most general type has not been discussed before , but it strongly indicates that our identifications of fluxes are physically correct , since energy - flux always carries angular momentum - flux unless the radiation is an @xmath0-wave .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in section [ kine ] , i will introduce the kinematics of the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism , and write down the einstein s equations . </S>",
    "<S> then i will discuss 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory aspects of the einstein s gravitation of 3 + 1 dimensions from this fibre bundle point of view .    in section [ out ] , i will study the four einstein s equations that are first - order in the derivatives along the out - going null vector field . </S>",
    "<S> these equations , which are the natural analogs of the einstein s constraint equations in the 3 + 1 formalism , turn out to be divergence - type equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is from the two - surface integrals of these equations that one obtains quasi - local balance equations of gravitational energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> i will also present quasi - local gravitational rotational energy . </S>",
    "<S> the carter s constant , which is usually interpreted as a measure of intrinsic rotation of gravitational field , is known to exist for a certain class of spacetimes that have two commuting killing symmetries , and for the kerr spacetime , it is just the total angular momentum squared . </S>",
    "<S> our quasi - local rotational energy reduces to the carter s constant for asymptotically kerr spacetimes , as is shown in [ k2 ] , and therefore , may be regarded as a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant to spacetimes that have no isometries .    in section [ hameq ] , it will be shown that the remaining einstein s equations , which are second - order in the derivatives along the out - going null vector field , are the hamilton s equations of motion derivable from a non - vanishing hamiltonian by the variational principle . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this derivation are given in appendix . </S>",
    "<S> thus , together with the quasi - local balance equations ( or constraint equations depending on the signature of the 3-dimensional hypersurface ) , the hamilton s equations of motion make up for the full einstein s equations in this formalism .    in section [ geom ] , quasi - local energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum of the previous sections </S>",

    "<S> discussions [ discuss ]    the key ingredient of the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism discussed so far is the observation that the out - going null vector field defines a natural time flow . with the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic as the time function of the theory , </S>",

    "<S> if one is interested in the strong gravity region near black holes , or black hole dynamics itself , then the caustics might cause serious problems since they are much more likely to occur as we approach strong gravity region along the in - going null geodesics .    </S>",
    "<S> quasi - local angular momentum was defined in this paper for spacetimes that have no isometries , and was found to be zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime . it was found to have the additive property , being a linear functional of a vector field @xmath7 that defines the rotation at each point of the two - surface . </S>",
    "<S> one might be interested in studying symmetry properties of this quasi - local angular momentum , and look for some generalization of the bms symmetries at a finite region@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , i obtained a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant of gravitational field , and interpreted it as gravitational contribution to the quasi - local rotational energy . </S>",
    "<S> the carter s constant is known to exist when the system under study has two commuting killing vector fields , such as the einstein - maxwell system and the einstein s equations coupled to a scalar field . for a generic gravitational field that has no isometries , no analog of the carter </S>",
    "<S> s constant is known . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> i presented a candidate for the generalized carter s constant which becomes zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime , and reduces to the total angular momentum squared in the asymptotic region of the kerr spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see how this quasi - local carter s constant generalizes when the electromagnetic and scalar fields are present .    there could be a number of applications of the quasi - local balance equations in astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> the most important and challenging problem seems to be the calculation of back - reaction on the geometry of black holes as a consequence of the emission or absorption of gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> one could also use the quasi - local balance equations in searching for consistent boundary conditions at a finite boundary in numerical relativity , since the boundary data at a finite boundary must satisfy the quasi - local balance equations . </S>",
    "<S> these problems are left for future works .    </S>",
    "<S> another issue in this ( 2,2 ) formalism is the well - posedness of the initial value problem . when the initial 3 dimensional hypersurface is chosen spacelike , there is no problem in the well - posedness of the initial value problem since the null direction can be viewed as a limit of timelike direction . </S>",
    "<S> but there are several other choices of initial surfaces , such as the double null initial surfaces and the initial / boundary value problems where the boundary can be either timelike or null . </S>",
    "<S> one of the difficulties associated with the characteristic or initial / boundary value problem is that one has to know the `` flows of information '' across the characteristic or the timelike boundary that belongs to the future . in these hybrid formulations of the einstein s equations , not so many articles that aim to study the well - posedness of the field equations appeared . </S>",
    "<S> however , a series of the recent papers by frittelli@xcite shows that , for a certain choice of first - order variables for the characteristic problem of the _ linearized _ einstein s equations , the system can be cast into manifestly well - posed form . for the non - linear characteristic problems , </S>",
    "<S> the notion of well - posedness is still not available . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to examine whether the first - order variables in this paper might have any relevance in establishing the well - posedness of the non - linear characteristic initial value problem .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , there are problems related to the gauge invariance of this ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that this formalism is tied to a particular gauge , and the non - vanishing hamiltonian is obtained as a consequence of selecting a particular time function , namely , choosing the affine parameter along the null direction as the time function . </S>",
    "<S> but one should notice that , in the standard adm formalism , it is also possible to obtain another non - vanishing hamiltonian if one chooses a time function such as the gauss normal time coordinate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if one quantizes the theory in a particular gauge , the resulting quantum theory will depend on that gauge , losing the spacetime diffeomorphism invariance that one wishes to carry over to the quantum regime . in view of the present situation </S>",
    "<S> that there is not any single complete version of sensible quantum theory of gravity , however , this gauge problem does not seem to be an urgent problem . clearly , quantizing the full einstein s gravity is beyond the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
