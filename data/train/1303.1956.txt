    "high masses were found in different types of pulsar binaries , starting with some in globular clusters ( ransom _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; freire _ et al .",
    "_ 2008a , 2008b ) . in these cases , however , the masses rely on observations of periastron advance , which is assumed to be due to general relativistic effects only ( rather than classical ones such as due to rotationally and tidally induced quadrupoles ) , and statistical arguments that the inclinations are unlikely to be very low .",
    "thus , it was still possible to doubt that very massive neutron stars could exist . however , such doubts disappeared , with accurate mass determinations for psr  j1614@xmath22230 @xmath3 ( demorest _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) and psr j1903 + 0327 @xmath4 ( freire _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ) , both relying on measurements of shapiro delay , which is not easily mimicked by other processes .    also x - ray eclipses are now claimed to be an useful tool for determining masses of compact stars ( rawls _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ) . in previous studies",
    "the x - ray eclipse duration had been approximated analytically by assuming that the companion star is spherical with an effective roche lobe radius .",
    "now , to include all these various mass limits which are calculated with a fair degree of accuracy , it is almost impossible to fit in any single neutron star model .",
    "the problem with the gravitationally bound nuclear matter is that as we go to the lower mass values , the gravitational bound becomes weaker and the compact star tends to become larger in size . whereas the exotic strange matter stars are bound by strong interaction as well as with gravity , and hence for a small mass ,",
    "the radius is also small .",
    "emphasis must be placed on the fact that some of these masses are not large and only the strange star equation of state ( eos ) can uniquely fit the masses of small and large compact objects .",
    "the idea of strange stars are well studied by now and in the model of dey _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) they were applied to 4u 1820@xmath030 and her - x-1 claiming a more compact nature of stellar objects compared to neutron stars - and also strange stars based on the mit bag model .",
    "the analysis of spectroscopic data on multiple thermonuclear bursts from 4u 1820@xmath030 in the globular cluster ngc 6624 yields well constrained values for the apparent emitting area and the eddington flux , both of which depend in a distinct way on the mass and radius of the compact star .    in the original model ( dey _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) the masses of the star 4u 1820@xmath030 and her x@xmath01 were estimated theoretically including different and appropriate scales for quark confinement and asymptotic freedom .",
    "they are now fitted to more accurate observations in this present paper .",
    "we find that the mass and radius of 4u 1820@xmath030 and 4u 1608@xmath052 which is found from new spectroscopic observations is fitted well with the new equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we also have fitted the large masses of psr j1614@xmath02230 and psr j1903@xmath00327 found from recent shapiro delay observations and predict their radii .",
    "we have predicted the radii of the six eclipsing binary pulsars including her x-1 using their masses fitted with current accurate determinations based on roche lobe geometry ( rawls _ et al .",
    "the strange matter equation of state that we have chosen for our present work is based on the fact that there are interacting quarks and the quark masses follow an asymptotic behaviour .",
    "it is an extension of the strange matter eos developed by dey _",
    "( 1998 ) , where there are interacting quarks , interaction taking place via the richardson potential in a mean field hartree - fock prescription .",
    "the parameter set that we employ used the asymptotic parameter @xmath5 = 100 mev and confinement parameter @xmath6= 360 mev along with an @xmath7 = 0.43 . to obtain larger masses for the strange stars we must have onset of chiral symmetry earlier with the free parameter n=2 since the lighter quarks can carry more kinetic energy with the masses given as below    @xmath8    the parameter",
    "n dictates how fast the quark masses fall off with increasing density as is given in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : quark - mass ] ) . the confinement in the medium is softened and",
    "the corresponding inverse debye screening length to the lowest order is given by ( baluni , 1978 ) :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , the fermi momentum of the _ i_-th quark is obtained from the corresponding number density : @xmath11 and @xmath7 is the perturbative quark gluon coupling .    assuming chiral symmetry is restored at high energy , the quark mass , @xmath12 , of i - th flavour , is taken to be density dependent so that it decreases with increasing density .",
    "@xmath13 is the quark mass when chiral symmetry is completely broken .",
    "@xmath14 are the current quark masses , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the chiral symmetry restoration is shown in figure([fig : umass ] ) as a function of the baryonic density @xmath18 @xmath19 . in the figure , we show two values of n , one corresponding to dey _",
    "( 1998 ) and the other , n=2.0 taken in this paper .",
    "the argument for taking a lower value of n is that the masses are decreasing faster as one goes inside the pulsar from the surface .",
    "that means there is a faster decrease in the scalar potential leading to sharper change in kinetic energy .",
    "the vector potential has not significantly changed from bagchi _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) , but both the asymptotic part and the debye screened part has relatively altered with sharper change in kinetic energy .",
    "the detection of massive ( @xmath20 ) pulsars has emphasized the need to study compact astrophysical objects since they place very strong constraints on the equation of state of matter at extreme nuclear densities ( e.g. , lattimer & prakash 2004 ) .",
    "stars having hyperons or quark stars having boson condensates , with softer eos can barely reach such limits . in this paper",
    "we try to explain these heavy pulsars as strange stars ( ss ) with density dependent quark mass .",
    "we will show that strange star models fit the the measured mass of pulsars ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath20 , because in these models the quark masses decrease fast with density as is shown in figure  ( [ fig : umass ] ) .",
    ".3 cm    .the parameters used for the eos [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "four stars her x-1 , 4u 1820 - 30 , sax j1808.4 and more recently the fast spinning xte j1739 - 285 were suggested to be strange stars .",
    "we add the stars whose masses are recently determined accurately : two from shapiro delay , six from roche lobe geometry for eclipsing stars which includes her x-1 and three from spectroscopic studies including 4u 1820@xmath030 . fitting these stars with a m - r curve of strange star",
    "effectively restricts the radii of these stars within sharp limits since the nature of the curve is restricted to smaller radii compared to neutron stars .",
    "as is well known the reason is that neutron stars have to be bound by gravitation so that to have a small radius it has to have a large mass .",
    "strange stars on the other hand are bound by strong interaction as well as gravitation so that small mass stars have necessarily small radii and for the large mass stars also the radius is not too large - as can indeed be seen from our figures 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the discovery of a 2@xmath22 binary millisecond pulsar raises the interesting possibility that psr j1614@xmath02230 was born from the collapse of a very massive 29 @xmath22 as discussed by tauris _",
    "this would support the idea of it being a strange star since this might lead to the strange matter phase .",
    "there is problem regarding the origin of the other shapiro - delay star psr j1903 + 0327 and freire _",
    "( 2011 ) comment that stellar evolution studies may provide new insights on how millisecond pulsars form . in a recent paper logoteta ,",
    "providencia , vidana and bombaci ( 2012 ) find that it is difficult to obtain masses larger than 1.62 @xmath22 even with hyperon or hybrid stars .",
