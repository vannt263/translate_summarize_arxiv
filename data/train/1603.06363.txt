    "taking into account the detection efficiency within the interval given by the monte carlo simulation ( 69.3% ) and the 95.5% efficiency of the pulse - shape discrimination to select @xmath41 and @xmath59 events , we got the half - life limit : @xmath104 yr . the excluded distribution of the @xmath100 decay of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] . the limit is lower than that obtained in the previous stage of the experiment @xcite due to slightly higher background in the high energy part and worse energy resolution of the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 detector .",
    "the counting rate of the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 detector is substantially suppressed in coincidence with the energy 511 kev in the hpge detectors .",

    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "there are only 115 events in the energy interval @xmath105 mev , while the simulated background model ( built by using the parameters of the anticoincidence spectrum fit ) contains 108 counts .",
    "we have estimated values of @xmath99 for the @xmath7 processes in @xmath0cd in different energy intervals .",
    "for instance , there are 62 counts in the energy interval @xmath106 kev , while the background model contains 68 counts .",
    "according to @xcite , one should take @xmath107 counts .",

    "the authors of work @xcite suggest in such a situation to report the so called `` sensitivity '' of the experiment defined as the average upper limit that would be obtained by an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal .",
    "following these suggestions we took a more conservative , background model independent limit on the number of events of the effect searched for as @xmath109 counts , which leads to the following half - life limit on the @xmath4 decay of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd which we accept as a final result :    @xmath110  yr .",

    "the limits on the processes with positron(s ) emission for transitions to the ground and excited states of @xmath0pd were obtained in a similar way mainly by using the coincidence of the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 detector with annihilation @xmath41 quanta in the hpge detectors ( the limits are presented in table  1 ) .",
    "a rather high sensitivity was achieved for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 decay channels thanks to the comparatively high probability to detect at least one annihilation gamma quantum by the hpge counters ( e.g. , 13.6% for the @xmath25 decay ) .",
    "further suppression of the background was achieved by selection of events in the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 detector in coincidence with the intense @xmath41 quanta in the hpge counters expected in the double electron capture in @xmath0cd to the excited levels of @xmath0pd .",
    "for instance , gamma quanta with energy 616 kev expected in the @xmath23 decay of @xmath0cd to the excited level 1128 kev of @xmath0pd can be detected by the hpge counters with a detection efficiency 2.42% ( 2.34% ) in the two neutrino ( neutrinoless ) process . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , there are only 17 ( 23 ) counts in the energy interval @xmath111 kev ( @xmath112 kev ) . according to @xcite one should take a `` sensitivity '' estimation of @xmath113 counts .",
    "the energy intervals contain 78.2% ( 86.2% ) of the simulated @xmath93 ( @xmath32 ) spectra .",
    "taking into account the efficiency of the pulse - shape discrimination , the time and energy coincidence with the gamma quanta 616 kev ( 97.3% in total ) , the following half - life limit on the @xmath93 ( @xmath32 ) decay of @xmath0cd to the excited level 1128 kev of @xmath0pd can be obtained : @xmath114  yr ( @xmath115  yr ) . the excluded distributions of the @xmath93 and @xmath32 decays of @xmath0cd to the 1128 kev excited level of @xmath0pd are presented in fig .",

    "typical detection efficiencies for the @xmath23 processes in @xmath0cd to the excited levels of @xmath0pd are @xmath116 depending on the level and decay mode , while the number of counts varies from 83 to 0 depending on the energy in the hpge detectors chosen to build the coincidence spectra .",
    "for example , 83 coincidence counts were obtained in the energy interval @xmath117 kev in cc with energy 512 kev in the hpge counters , while 0 events were detected in the energy interval @xmath118 kev in the coincidence with the energy 1160 kev in the hpge detectors ( resonant @xmath119 capture to the 2718 kev excited level of @xmath0pd ) .",
    "we have also used the data accumulated by the hpge detectors to estimate limits on the @xmath7 processes in @xmath0cd .",
