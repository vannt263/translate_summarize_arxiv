    "the problem of generalizing ordinary continued fractions to the higher - dimensional case was posed by c.  hermite  @xcite in 1839 . a large number of attempts to solve this problem leads to the birth of several different remarkable theories of multidimensional continued fractions . in this paper",

    "the papers  @xcite and  @xcite by b.  f.  skubenko and  @xcite by o.  n.  german are dedicated to the generalization of ordinary continued fractions with bounded above integer lengths of edges ( the numbers that corresponds to such continued fractions are the numbers with the worst possible rational approximations ) . for the classical theory of ordinary continued fractions",
    "we refer to the book  @xcite by a.  ya .  hinchin .",
    "v.  i.  arnold suggested to investigate the geometry and combinatorics of continued fractions ( it contains the study of properties for such notions as affine types of the faces of the sails , their quantities and frequencies , integer angles between the faces , integer distances , volumes and so on ) in his article  @xcite and the book  @xcite .",
    "some examples of the periodic continued fractions were calculated in the papers  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite by e.  korkina , @xcite and  @xcite by g.  lachaud , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite by a.  d.  bruno and v.  i.  parusnukov , @xcite and  @xcite by the author .",

    "the boundary of the convex hull of all integer points except the origin in the closure of the orthant is called the _ sail _ of the orthant .",
    "the set of all @xmath9 sails is called the _ @xmath10-dimensional continued fraction _ constructed according to the given @xmath8 hyperplanes .",
    "two @xmath10-dimensional continued fractions are said to be _ equivalent _ if the union of all sails of the first continued fraction is integer - linear equivalent to the union of all sails of the second continued fraction .",
    "an operator in the group @xmath11 is called an _ integer irreducible hyperbolic operator _ if the following conditions hold :    \\i ) the characteristic polynomial of this operator is irreducible over @xmath12 ;    \\ii ) all its eigenvalues are distinct and real .",
    "consider some integer irreducible hyperbolic operator @xmath13 .",
    "let us take the @xmath10-dimensional spaces that span all subsets of @xmath10 linearly independent eigenvectors of the operator @xmath14 .",
    "the spans of every @xmath10 eigenvectors uniquely define @xmath8 hyperplanes passing through the origin in general position .",

    "unfortunately , the proof of this theorem is not yet published .",
    "the algebraic version of the generalized lagrange theorem was obtained by g.  lachaud .",
    "the formulation of his theorem requires special notation and definitions , so we just refer the reader to the article  @xcite , since we will not use it further . for more information on generalizations of the lagrange theorem for the ordinary continued fractions to the multidimensional case",

    "fundamental domain _ of a sail we mean the union of some faces that contains exactly one face from each equivalence class ( with respect to the action of the group @xmath21 ) .",
    "a multidimensional periodic algebraic continued fraction is a set of infinite polyhedral surfaces ( i.e. ,  sails ) , that contain an infinite number of faces . as we have already mentioned , the quotient of any sail under the dirichlet group action is isomorphic to an @xmath10-dimensional torus .",
    "the algebraic periodicity of the polyhedron allows to reconstruct the whole continued fraction knowing only the fundamental domain .",
    "moreover , any fundamental domain contains only a finite number of faces of the whole algebraic periodic continued fraction .",
    "hence we are faced with the problem of finding a good algorithm that enumerates all the faces for this domain .",
    "there were no algorithm for constructing multidimensional continued fractions until t.  shintani s work  @xcite in  1976 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a totally real algebraic field of degree @xmath10 .",
    "we take all different embeddings of @xmath28 into @xmath2 and denote them by @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( there are exactly @xmath10 different embeddings , since @xmath28 is totally real ) .",

    "for an arbitrary element @xmath32 of @xmath28 we suppose @xmath33 t.  shintani considered the action of the group of all totally positive elements for the ring of integers of @xmath28 ( by component - wise multiplication by totally positive integers @xmath34 ) on @xmath35 for the described embedding of @xmath28 .",
    "he proved that the fundamental domain for this action is the union of a finite number of simplicial cones of special type .",
    "( note that if we take some other order for the embeddings @xmath36 , then the fundamental domains will be integer - linear equivalent to the fundamental domains for the embeddings considered above . )",
    "the statement of t.  shintani and its proof is actually the basis for the construction of one - dimensional continued fractions .",
    "following t.  shintani s work , e.  thomas and a.  t.  vasques obtained several fundamental domains for the two - dimensional case in  @xcite . finally , r.  okazaki presented a method that permits to construct fundamental domains for fields of arbitrary degree in his article  @xcite .",
    "e.  korkina in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and g.  lachaud in  @xcite ,  @xcite produced an infinite number of fundamental domains for periodic algebraic two - dimensional continued fractions .",
    "the method used for constructing fundamental domains of multidimensional continued fractions in these papers was inductive .",
    "the method produces the fundamental domain face by face , verifying that each new face does not lie in the same orbit with some face constructed before .",
    "applying the method , one can find the fundamental domain in finitely many steps .",
    "later on j.  o.  moussafir developed an essentially different approach in his work  @xcite .",
    "it works for an arbitrary ( not necessary periodic ) continued fraction and computes any bounded part of an infinite polyhedron .",
    "the approach is based on deduction .",
    "one produces a conjecture on the face structure for a big part of the continued fraction , then it remains to prove that any conjectured face is indeed a face of the part .",
    "this method can be also applied to the case of periodic continued fractions .    in the present paper",
    "we describe a new advanced deductive construction adapted especially to fundamental domains of periodic continued fractions .",
    "the construction involves a method for conjecturing the structure of the fundamental domain and an algorithm testing whether the conjectured domain is indeed fundamental .",
    "the main advantage of our algorithm is the following : the number of  false  vertices of our approximation is much smaller than the number of  false  vertices of the approximation in the method of j.  o.  moussafir ( so that the computational time is considerable reduced ) .",
    "note that this algorithm substantially uses the periodicity of the continued fraction and hence it is impossible to apply it to non - periodic continued fractions .",
    "we prove the following statement for the two - dimensional case .",
    "_ suppose we have a conjecture on the structure of the fundamental domain for some sail of a two - dimensional periodic continued fraction .",
    "let this domain contain @xmath37 faces of all dimensions . the test of the conjecture @xmath3our algorithm@xmath4 requires no more than @xmath38 additions , multiplications and comparisons of two integers , where @xmath24 is a universal constant that does not depend on @xmath37 .",
    "_    all previous verification algorithms work exponential time with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "here we do not take into account that the integers can be quite large . to calculate upper bounds for the working time of the algorithms we need to multiply upper bounds for the number of operations by some polynomial of the coefficients of the matrix defining the continued fraction .",
    "using the present algorithm , the author both generalized almost all known simple examples and series of examples of fundamental domains constructed before , and found a lot of new examples and series ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) . using these examples , the author found the complete list of all two - dimensional periodic continued fractions constructed by matrices of small norm ( @xmath39 ) up to the integer - linear equivalence relation , see  @xcite . by the norm of a matrix , here we mean the sum of the absolute values of all its coefficients .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the new method of sail construction consists of six steps .",
    "we discuss its plan in section  1 . in section  2",
    "we describe the two common steps for both inductive and deductive methods . in this section",
    "we show how to find the generators for the group of @xmath40-matrices commuting with the given one .",
    "all results of section  2 are well - known and are given for completeness of exposition ( see also the works  @xcite by cohen and  @xcite by g.  lachaud ) . in sections  3 and  4 , we discuss the essential new part of the method .",
    "we show how to produce conjectures on fundamental domains in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we describe the algorithm for conjecture tests in the case of two - dimensional continued fractions . in that section",
    ", we also say a few words about the higher dimensional case .",
    "we conclude in section  5 with the detailed study of one example of the method s application ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "now we briefly outline the main idea of the new construction of one of the fundamental domains of the multidimensional continued fraction corresponding to the given integer irreducible hyperbolic operator .",
    "suppose that we are given the integer irreducible hyperbolic operator @xmath41 . to compute some fundamental domain of a sail of the continued fraction associated to @xmath14",
    "it is sufficient to do the following :    * 1 . *",
    "compute a convex hull approximation of the sail . namely take a large enough convenient set of integer points and find its convex hull .",
    "make a conjecture on some fundamental domain .",
    "here we need to guess a set of faces that might form a fundamental domain .",
    "we do this by finding a repeatable pattern in faces geometry .",
    "prove the conjecture if possible .",
    "if can not prove the conjecture , start with * 1 . *",
    "but with a larger convenient set of points .",
    "in this situation the following two questions are actual : + _ how to find a convenient set of integer points for the approximation of the sail ? _ + _ how to test whether the conjecture of a fundamental domain of the sail is true or not ? _",
    "+ we give the answers to these questions in the present paper .",
    "let us briefly itemize the main steps of the method .",

    "_ test the produced ( in step  4 ) conjecture .    it is supposed that the fundamental domain conjectured in step  5 and the basis @xmath42 of the group @xmath22 satisfy the following conditions : + i ) the closure of the fundamental domain is homeomorphic to the disk ; + ii ) the operators @xmath42 define the gluing of this disk to the @xmath10-dimensional torus .",
    "both inductive and deductive algorithms require the first and the second steps .",
    "we describe these two steps in the next section .",
    "all other steps are essential for our construction . in the method by j .- o .",
    "moussafir  @xcite the conjecture has been producing using the approximation of the orthant by some rational orthant . in the present paper",
    "we propose to produce conjectures for some set of periods , see the description of steps  3 and  4 .",
    "we show how to test conjectures in the case of two - dimensional continued fractions in the description of step  5 .",
    "the result is partially based on the theorem on integer - affine classification of two - dimensional faces at the integer distances to the origin greater than one from  @xcite .",
    "( for the case of @xmath10-dimensional continued fractions for @xmath43 , the last step is quite complicated , since the classification of tree - dimensional faces at the integer distances to the origin greater than one is unknown . ) in the last step we also investigate an important particular case that seems to be quite common for periodic @xmath10-dimensional continued fractions as well .",
    "note that all deductive algorithms are not algorithms in the strict sense .",
    "one should choose some basis of @xmath21 in the right way , produce a good conjecture , and then test it .",
    "even the algorithmic recognition of the period for the given picture of the boundary of the sail approximation is supposed to be a hard problem .",
    "that is the reason why this `` algorithm '' can not be done completely by some computer program .",
    "but at the other hand , the deductive algorithm is effective in practice .",
    "all of the examples listed in the article  @xcite were produced using this algorithm .",
    "the examples of this paper generalize and expand almost all known periods of the sails calculated before .    the present method can be naturally generalized to the case of minkowski - voronoi model of multidimensional continued fractions .",

    "let us identify the space @xmath50 with the space @xmath51 and consider the standard metrics for this space .",

    "thus by proposition  [ for_basis1 ] below all norms of elements of the basis are bounded above by @xmath54    applying the lll - algorithm described by a.  k.  lenstra , h.  w.  lenstra and jr . , and l.  lovsz in  @xcite to the lattice generated by @xmath55 one constructs some reduced basis .",
