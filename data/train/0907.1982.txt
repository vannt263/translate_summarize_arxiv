    "in two earlier articles @xcite we developed the general approach for the square gradient description of an interface between two phases in non - equilibrium @xmath0-component mixtures . using that approach it is possible to determine the continuous profiles of all variables through the interface during , for instance , evaporation and condensation . in this paper",
    "we will use these results to obtain the transfer coefficients for heat and mass transfer through the liquid vapor interface .",
    "the values of these transfer coefficients , or even their order of magnitude , is extremely important for industrial processes which involve evaporation and/or condensation of mixtures . among these processes",
    "is , for instance , distillation , when one needs to separate components with different volatilities .",
    "as this involves evaporation and/or condensation repeatedly many times , it is very important to know the exact effect of the surface .",
    "some values of the interfacial transfer coefficients may favor transport of one component , while the others may favor adsorption of a component at the surface .",
    "of particular interest are the values of the cross coefficients , which contribute to reversible transport , and which are in most descriptions neglected @xcite .",
    "a number of different methods have been used to obtain the surface transfer coefficients for one - component systems : experiments @xcite , molecular dynamic simulations @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite . in a paper coauthored by one of us @xcite the interfacial transfer coefficients obtained from the gradient theory for a one - component system",
    "were calculated and compared to the data in the above references . even for one - component systems",
    "the database of interfacial transfer coefficients is poor and these data are pretty scattered .",
    "the situation is even worse for mixtures .",
    "there are only few experiments available for several systems @xcite at a very restrictive range of conditions , i.e. for instance , at infinite dilution .",
    "no molecular dynamic simulations are available yet .",
    "the only source of the values of interfacial coefficients is kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is most appropriate for short range potentials and low density gases .",
    "there is evidence from molecular dynamic simulations for longer range potentials @xcite that the coupling transfer resistivities for liquid - vapor interfaces of real fluids are substantially larger than those predicted by kinetic theory .    in the first paper @xcite we discussed the balance equations and the gibbs relation for the square gradient model of mixtures .",
    "the gibbs relation enabled us to derive the entropy production .",
    "it followed that if one uses as thermodynamic forces the gradient of the inverse temperature , @xmath1 , minus the gradients of the chemical potential differences with the @xmath0th component divided by the temperature , @xmath2 $ ] , for @xmath3 , and minus the gradient of the velocity gradient divided by the temperature , @xmath4 , that the conjugate fluxes are the total heat flux , @xmath5 , the diffusion fluxes of the first @xmath6 components relative to the barycentric frame of reference , @xmath7 , and the viscous pressure tensor .",
    "linear laws relating these forces and fluxes could then be given . together with the balance equations it is then possible to calculate the profiles of all the variables .",
    "in the second paper @xcite we gave details of the numerical solution procedure for stationary states .",
    "we defined excess densities for an arbitrary dividing surface and verified that the non - equilibrium surface , as described by these excess densities following gibbs , is in local equilibrium .",
    "our work @xcite extended the analysis given by johannessen et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the validity of local equilibrium for the description in terms of the gibbs excess densities , it is possible to develop a description using non - equilibrium thermodynamics as explained in the monograph by kjelstrup and bedeaux @xcite .",
    "this is much easier than the continuous description .",
    "as we will verify in this paper the expression for the excess entropy production of a surface has the general form @xmath8 in this expression @xmath9 are the heat and mass fluxes through the surface and @xmath10 are the jumps in the intensive variables across the interface",
    ". in non - equilibrium one uses the finite jumps of the temperature and chemical potentials across the surface , which lead to a non - zero entropy productions in the interfacial region .",
    "these jumps become the driving forces for the heat and mass transport through the interface . following the traditional approach of non - equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "we then write the linear force - flux relations .",
    "these expressions use the interfacial resistivities or transfer coefficients which are the key interest of this paper .    having the continuous profiles of thermodynamic quantities obtained from the non - equilibrium gradient model we are able to calculate these resistivities independently",

    "the definition of an excess requires the normal direction @xmath51 to be defined in the interfacial region .",

    "furthermore let @xmath58 , where superscript @xmath59 stands either for @xmath60 or for @xmath61 , be the function @xmath57 extrapolated from the bulk to the surface region .",
    "the extrapolation is done using the description in homogeneous phases which does not contain gradient contributions .",
    "outside of the interfacial region @xmath58 and @xmath57 are identical but inside the surface , @xmath58 in general differs from @xmath57 .",
    "we note the following identity for the extrapolated functions @xmath62 furthermore , for any function @xmath63 @xmath64 in the interfacial region , since for the bulk functions outside the interfacial region it is identity .",
    "we note however , that even though eq .   and eq .   are exact , any numerical procedure will break these equalities .",
    "this happens because the extrapolation procedure usually involves polynomials in order to fit an actual curve , which introduces a non - zero error in the extrapolated curve .",

    "thus , @xmath75 . we show in appendix  [ [ sec / appendix / excess / gradient ] ] that @xmath76where all the functions on the right hand side are evaluated at @xmath77 .    for each flux in eq .",
    "we can write @xmath78 .",
    "this gives an approximate relation for the order of magnitude @xmath79as was discussed in @xcite , the interfacial region breaks the 3-dimensional isotropy of the system .",
    "in addition to a typical macroscopic size of the problem @xmath60 , there exists the microscopic size @xmath80 , the surface width , which is of the order of few nanometers .",
    "there are quantities which change drastically on the distances of the order @xmath80 in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "however , the significant change of any quantity along the surface may happen only on a length scale @xmath60 , which is of the order of either radii of curvature or the system size .",
    "because of this property of a surface , we may not expect the change of the parallel component of a flux on a macroscopic scale along the surface to be much larger then the change of the perpendicular component of that flux on a microscopic scale through the surface .",
    "for the fluxes for which changes @xmath81 and @xmath82 are of the same order of magnitude , eq .   takes the form @xmath83 , which can hold only if @xmath84 , since @xmath85 .",
    "this means that both @xmath86 and @xmath87 . if @xmath88 this statement becomes even stronger .",

    "the next step of the analysis is to provide constitutive relations in order to relate thermodynamic forces @xmath110 to thermodynamic fluxes @xmath111 for the whole surface .",
    "this requires that the excess entropy production has a form @xmath112 .",
    "however , as one can see from eq .  , the terms related to fluxes along the surface do not have this form .",
    "one has to make further assumptions on the nature of these terms to write them in this form .",
    "as our work is focused on transport into and through the surface we will not consider non - equilibrium perturbations which are applied along the surface .",
    "this guarantees that all the terms along the surface are equal to zero .",
    "the only nonzero component of any flux @xmath113 is therefore @xmath98 , which we will denote simply as @xmath114 .",
    "we will furthermore restrict ourself to non - viscous fluids .",

    "choosing @xmath349 gives values for the condensation coefficients of 0.54 and 0.62 .",
    "as the components considered are very similar it is to be expected that these coefficients are close to each other .",
    "the values of @xmath288 s obtained from the matching are such that the excess entropy production of the surface is positive , the second law is obeyed and the onsager relations are valid . having found the values of the @xmath288 s from the diagonal transfer coefficients the value of the cross coefficients follows uniquely .",
    "we found that the values of the cross coefficients , obtained by our method are between 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than those found from kinetic theory .",
    "this confirms results from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , where it was found that increasing the range of the attractive potential increased in particular the cross coefficients substantially above the values predicted by kinetic theory .",
    "this is an interesting result , indicating that kinetic theory underestimates the transfer coefficients for real fluids .",
    "this also indicates , that the effect of coupling will be important in the interfacial region .",
    "experiments also confirm the importance of the cross coefficients @xcite .",
    "the effect of cross coefficients can be related to the measurable quantities , such as measurable heat of transfer @xmath350 .",
    "this quantity can be associated both with gas and liquid phases in accordance to the corresponding heat fluxes .",
    "the difference @xmath351 is equal to the difference of partial enthalpies between gas and liquid in equilibrium .",
    "this quantity is substantial , which indicates that @xmath352 is also substantial .",
    "this , in turn , makes the difference between the cross coefficients on gas and liquid side to be non - vanishing .",
    "this gives a theoretical ground for the importance of coupling in the interfacial region .",
    "experiments @xcite confirm the size and importance of the heat of transfer on the gas side .",
    "we did the comparison for one value of the temperature and chemical potential only .",
    "if one extends the analysis to a larger domain , one finds that the @xmath288 s depend on the temperature and the chemical potential difference ; we refer to @xcite in this context .",
    "the results of kinetic theory @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite both support the existence of a peak in the diagonal local resistivities and therefore the use of finite values for @xmath197 and @xmath199 .",
    "we want to thank eivind johannessen for advise .",
    "we are also grateful to nfr for storforks grant no.167336/v30 .",
    "one may think of an alternative definition of an excess quantity @xmath353 we note however , that @xmath354 has no physical meaning , while @xmath355 has .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath356 is the total amount of some physical quantity in the volume which is limited by the surfaces @xmath357 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while @xmath358 is not .",
    "if the interfacial thickness is small compared to the radii of curvature , the difference between @xmath355 and @xmath354 is small and vanishes for planar interface considered under cartesian coordinates .",
    "however , it is @xmath359 but not @xmath360 which is a physical amount , and thus @xmath355 is the surface density .        consider a function @xmath57 being the divergence of a vector function : @xmath361 .",
    "then @xmath362 where @xmath363 and @xmath364 and @xmath365 are defined similarly to @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "furthermore its excess @xmath368 using the standard formula for the divergence of a vectorial function in curvilinear coordinates @xmath369 one can show that @xmath370 using the standard formula for the gradient of a scalar function in curvilinear coordinates @xmath371 one can show that for heaviside step function @xmath372 @xmath373 substituting eq .   into eq .   and using eq .   and",
    "eq .   we obtain @xmath374 where @xmath375 and we took into account that according to eq .   @xmath376 ."
