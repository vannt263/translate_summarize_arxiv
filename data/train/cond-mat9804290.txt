    "in auxiliary - field quantum monte - carlo methods ( afqmc ) , such as the projector , grand - canonical @xcite and shell - model quantum monte - carlo methods @xcite , the boltzmann operator @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the hamiltonian , is decomposed in a sum or integral of exponentials of one - body operators . this sum or integral",
    "is then evaluated using monte - carlo techniques . for the decomposition ,",
    "these methods rely on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite , which is based on the identity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a one - body operator . in order to avoid problems due to non - commuting operators",
    ", one can split up the boltzmann operator using the suzuki - trotter formula @xcite .",
    "one can discretize the hubbard - stratonovich transformation by applying a gaussian quadrature formula to the integral over @xmath4 . after a suzuki - trotter expansion in @xmath5 slices",
    ", a three - points quadrature formula leads to an error of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "this is of the same order in @xmath7 and @xmath5 as the errors due to the non - commutativity of the squared operators that build up @xmath1 .",
    "for some systems one can derive an exact , discrete hubbard - stratonovich transform .",
    "hirsch showed how one can write an operator of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the site occupation number for an electron with spin projection @xmath4 , exactly as a sum of two exponentials of one - body operators @xcite .",
    "recently , gunnarsson and koch extended this to systems with higher orbital degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe another discrete decomposition scheme , which is exact for a certain class of operators .",
    "this decomposition scheme is generalized to any two - body hamiltonian using the suzuki - trotter formula . for the application in afqmc methods , especially the shell - model quantum monte - carlo method",
    ", this new decomposition has the advantage , compared to the discretized hubbard - stratonovich transform based on eq.([hubstrat1 ] ) , that it is more accurate and that it leads to low - rank matrices .",
    "this leads to faster matrix multiplications and requires less computer memory .",
    "afqmc methods for fermions often have sign problems @xcite .",
    "fahy and hamann @xcite showed that these sign problems can be related to the diffusive behavior of states in the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation . because our decomposition , in general , is based on exponentials of one - body operators of a completely different type",
    ", one can expect different sign properties .",
    "our decomposition is not free of sign problems , but there might be systems where it leads to a sign rule while the hubbard - stratonovich transformation does not , or where our decomposition causes significally less sign problems .    in section",
    "ii we introduce a matrix notation for slater determinants and operators needed for a clear discussion of the decomposition . in section",
    "iii a basic lemma is given on which the decomposition is based . in section",
    "iv the exact decomposition for a certain class of operators is presented .",
    "we indicate how to apply this decomposition to a general two - body hamiltonian . in section v the relation with hirsch s decomposition for the hubbard model is elucidated .",
    "finally , in section vi the decomposition for the nuclear pairing hamiltonian is discussed and illustrated with afqmc - results for an exactly solvable model .",
    "in order to avoid confusion between matrix representations in the space of single - particle states and the operators themselves in fock space , we will denote the former with upper case and the latter with lower case characters .",
    "let @xmath10 be a set of basis states for the single - particle space , @xmath11 be the related creation operators and the @xmath12-particle state @xmath13 the antisymmetrized product of a set of single - particle states @xmath14 .",
    "i.e. @xmath15 is a slater determinant .",
    "thus in second quantization one can write @xmath16 this defines a matrix representation @xmath17 for a slater determinant @xmath15 .",
    "the value of this representation is that one can represent certain operations on the slater determinant by matrix operations on m. e.g. the overlap between two slater determinants @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 . the exponential of a one - body operator acting on @xmath15 results in a new slater determinant , @xmath21 ( this is a corollary of the thouless - theorem @xcite ) , whose matrix representation is related to @xmath17 by @xmath22 , where the @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 .",
    "reversily , given a @xmath23 matix @xmath26 , one can consider the operator @xmath27 , defined by its action on slater determinants : @xmath28 if @xmath26 is non - singular , @xmath27 is the exponential of a one - body operator .",
    "the operation represented by the unit matrix plus a matrix of rank two can be expressed as a sum of one- and two - body operators in the following way : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 row matrices and @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "consider the @xmath12-particle slater determinant @xmath15 represented by the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "consider also a slater determinant @xmath35 , that has particles in the single - particle states @xmath36 .",
    "the slater determinants of this type constitue a basis of the @xmath12-particle hilbert space .",
    "the overlap of @xmath35 with @xmath15 is given by @xmath37 the notation @xmath38 denotes the vector that is given by the @xmath39 column of @xmath17 , the notation @xmath40 for an @xmath41-element vector @xmath42 denotes the @xmath12-element vector @xmath43 .",
    "the operator in eq.([r2operator ] ) transforms @xmath15 into @xmath18 with @xmath44 . to calculate the overlap of @xmath18 with @xmath35",
    ", we have to replace every column @xmath45 in eq.([r2over ] ) : @xmath46 the overlap is then given by @xmath47 this determinant can be expanded as the sum of all determinants that are obtained by selecting in every column of eq.([r2over2 ] ) one of the terms @xmath45 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 . if in more than one column the term @xmath48 is selected , then the determinant has two linearly dependent columns , so it will vanish .",
    "the same holds for the term @xmath49 .",
    "only four types of determinants remain :    * @xmath50 is selected in every column .",
    "this determinant is just @xmath51 ( see eq.([r2over ] ) ) .",
    "* @xmath48 is selected in column @xmath52 , @xmath50 in all others .",
    "these determinants sum up to @xmath53 ( one particle is moved from state @xmath54 to state @xmath55 ) .",
    "* @xmath56 is selected in column @xmath52 , @xmath50 in all others .",
    "these determinants sum up to @xmath57 ( one particle is moved from state @xmath58 to state @xmath59 ) .",
    "* @xmath48 is selected in column @xmath52 , @xmath60 is selected in column @xmath61 , @xmath50 in all others .",
    "these determinants sum up to @xmath62 ( two particles are moved from states @xmath54 and @xmath58 to states @xmath55 and @xmath59 ) .    taking all these terms together",
    ", we find that latexmath:[\\[\\langle \\psi_l | \\psi_{m ' } \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_l | 1+\\alpha\\hat{b}_1^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_4 + \\beta\\hat{b}_2^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_3 + \\alpha\\beta \\hat{b}_1^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_2^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_3\\hat{b}_4    @xmath35 , so that @xmath64 this proves eq.([r2operator ] ) .",
    "consider a fermionic two - body operator @xmath65 of the form @xmath66 an operator of this form has the special property that @xmath67 because of this relation , the exponential of @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 now we can use the lemma to obtain a discrete decomposition of @xmath70 in a sum of exponentials of one - body operators : @xmath71 with @xmath72 the @xmath32 row matrix which has a 1 on the @xmath73 entry and zeros anywhere else , and @xmath74 this is an exact hubbard - stratonovich - like decomposition of the form of eq.([exdecoform ] ) . to apply this discrete hubbard - stratonovich - like decomposition to the boltzmann operator @xmath75 for a general fermionic two - body operator @xmath76 , one has to rewrite @xmath76 as a sum of operators of the form eq.([exdecoform ] ) . a trivial way to do this ,",
    "is given by @xmath77 the suzuki - trotter formula can be used to split up the boltzmann operator into factors with only one operator @xmath78 in the exponent",
    ". then each of these factors can be decomposed exactly using the discrete decomposition in eq.([exdisco ] ) .",
    "note that the total decomposition is no longer exact because of the non - commutativity of the operators @xmath78 .",
    "the error will be of the order @xmath79",
    ". it will be much smaller than in case of a decomposition based on a gaussian discretization of the integral in eq.([hubstrat1 ] ) , because now the error is proportional to the commutators of the operators @xmath78 and no longer to a power of @xmath76 .",
    "for the hubbard model we have to find a decomposition for a boltzmann operator of the form @xmath80 . where @xmath81 is the interaction strength and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 is an index for the spin degree - of - freedom .",
    "the exponent has a two - body operator @xmath84 , which is an operator of the form of eq.([exdecoform ] ) , so we can apply the decomposition given in eq.([exdisco ] ) and obtain : @xmath85 with @xmath86 the matrix which is zero everywhere except for the diagonal element related to the spin - up ( spin - down ) site , which is equal to 1 .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 are given by @xmath89 now one could scale each term in eq.([hirschdeco ] ) with an operator of the form @xmath90 , because in the canonical ensemble this is just a constant .",
    "the matrices in the decomposition now have to be multiplied with the matrix @xmath91 . in case of the repulsive hubbard model ,",
    "the choice @xmath92 leads to the discrete hubbard - stratonovich transform of hirsch @xcite . from the computational point of view this particular choice of @xmath93",
    "has the advantage that the matrix representation for the spin - down part is related to the matrix representation for the spin - up part by a matrix inversion .",
    "then one only has to keep track of the spin - up part in actual afqmc calculations .",
    "hirsch s decomposition for the attractive hubbard model can also be obtained from eq.([hirschdeco ] ) , with a particular choice for @xmath93 . in this case",
    "however , there is no computational advantage in taking any particular value .",
    "the hamiltonian for nuclear pairing in a degenerate shell is given by @xmath94 here it is assumed that there are @xmath95 degenerate single - particle states . the single - particle energy is shifted to @xmath96 mev .",
    "so there is no one - body part in the hamiltonian .",
    "the states with @xmath97 are labeled from 1 to @xmath98 and @xmath99 denotes the time - reversed state of state @xmath61 .",
    "the many - body problem for this model can be solved analytically using the seniority scheme @xcite .    using the suzuki - trotter formula ,",
    "the boltmann operator for this hamiltonian can be written as @xmath100 with @xmath101 the error is of the order @xmath102 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath7 is small . in practice",
    ", one has to split @xmath7 in a number of inverse - temperature slices using the suzuki - trotter formula .",
    "then one can apply the procedure that is discussed here to each inverse - temperature slice seperately .",
    "we have @xmath103 .",
    "so we can find a decomposotion of the type given in eq.([exdisco ] ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "we have applied this decomposition to study a degenerate shell of 20 states @xmath106 , with 10 particles .",
    "this could model the valence model space for neutrons in the @xmath107 shell in @xmath108 , if one neglects the energy gap between the @xmath109 and the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 orbitals . for the strength of the interaction we took @xmath113 mev @xmath114 mev , as recommended in @xcite .",
    "we have performed a shell - model quantum monte - carlo calculation in the canonical ensemble , following @xcite , but now using the new decomposition of eq.([pairdeco ] ) instead of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation . in order to make the systematic error smaller than the statistical error ,",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath7 was split into slices of length @xmath115 .",
    "we point out that the form @xmath116 can be rewritten as @xmath117 , such that there is a symmetry between states with @xmath97 and their time - reversed states .",
    "this symmetry guarantees that there will be no sign problem for systems with an even number of particles .",
    "this sign - rule is analogous to the sign rule for the pairing - plus - quadrupole hamiltonian decomposed using the hubbard - stratonovich transform @xcite . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the internal energy of the system as a function of temperature . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the corresponding specific heat of the system as a function of temperature .",
    "the monte - carlo results are in excellent agreement with the analytical results .",
    "the peak in de specific - heat curve around a temperature of @xmath118 mev . can be associated with the breakup of @xmath119 pairs .",
    "it is straightforward to take into account the different single - particles energies and more general forms of the pairing hamiltonian : @xmath120 extension to even more general two - body hamiltonians is possible .",
    "then there can be sign problems at low temperatures .",
    "we have presented a new type of discrete hubbard - stratonovich decomposition for the boltzmann operator .",
    "it is exact for a special class of two - body operators .",
    "applied to the hubbard hamiltonian , it leads to hisrch s discrete hubbard - stratonovich decomposition .",
    "the decomposition is well suited for the nuclear pairing hamiltonian , where it leads to a sign rule for systems with an even number of particles .",
