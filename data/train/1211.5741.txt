    "the notion of an @xmath0 structure for a space is first introduced in stasheff @xcite , whose idea is spread into a wide area of mathematics and becomes a basic idea in both mathematics and physics .    on the other hand from the beginning , two apparently distinct definitions of an",
    "` @xmath0 form ' for a space are given to exist : the original definition described in @xcite requires an existence of _ strict - unit _ which is used to construct a projective or a classifying space , while the second definition described in stasheff @xcite was claimed to be equivalent in @xcite and used extensively in @xcite which requires just a _ hopf - unit _ ( a strict unit as an h - space ) or even an _ h - unit _ ( a homotopy unit as an h - space ) a slightly weaker condition . to follow the arguments in @xcite on the equivalence of two definitions",
    ", we must use lemma 7 in @xcite recursively .",
    "however , at the stage to obtain a new @xmath3-form , the proof must use lemma 7 which is depending on retractile arguments due to james @xcite , and thus , the relative homotopy types of old and new @xmath3-forms are possibly different ( see @xcite , @xcite or zabrodsky @xcite ) .",
    "that means , at least , we can not guarantee that there exist higher forms for new @xmath3-form .",
    "in particular , it is shown in iwase and mimura @xcite that some @xmath4 space has exotic @xmath5-form which does not admit @xmath6-form for any @xmath7 . alternatively , if one tries to adopt the approach , we actually discussed here , one should encounter problems to show a version of proposition 24 of @xcite which gives an crucial step to show theorem 5 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , proposition 24 of @xcite may not hold without a _ strict unit_. these problems puzzled the author for many years after @xcite .    in this paper , we work in @xmath8 the category of spaces and continuous maps , unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us remark that the exponential law does not always hold in @xmath8 .",

    "we say @xmath17 is an h - space with _ h - unit _ , if the restriction of @xmath18 to @xmath19 is ( based ) homotopic to the folding map @xmath20 given by @xmath21 .",
    "we also say @xmath17 is an h - space with _ hopf - unit _ if @xmath22 is a two - sided strict unit of @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , we say @xmath23 is a map between h - spaces regarding _ h - units _ , if @xmath17 and @xmath24 are h - spaces with _ h - units _ and @xmath25 lies in the same connected component of @xmath26 .",
    "we also say @xmath23 is a map between h - spaces regarding _ hopf - units _ , if @xmath17 and @xmath24 are h - spaces with _ hopf - units _ and @xmath27 .",
    "we say an h - space with _ h - unit _ ( or _ hopf - unit _ ) is loop - like , if both right and left translations are homotopy - equivalences .",
    "so a cw complex h - space with _ h - unit _ , whose @xmath28 is a loop ( an algebraic generalization of a group ) , is a loop - like h - space with _ hopf - unit_. in page 34 of adams @xcite , it is pointed out that theorem 5 of @xcite is implicitly shown to be true for a cw complex h - space whose @xmath28 is a group when @xmath29 . a corresponding generalization including the case when @xmath30 would be for a cw complex h - space whose @xmath28 is a loop , or equivalently , a cw complex loop - like space . in fact , in the proof of theorem 5 of @xcite , this latter assumption is necessary to apply the arguments given in dold and thom @xcite or mimura - toda @xcite to deduce that the projections obtained using @xmath0 form are all quasi - fibrations by using induction arguments .",

    "we can also show a slightly stronger result of theorem 11.5 in @xcite using the idea of @xmath4 form _ without unit _ as follows :    [ thm : abs ] let @xmath16 be a multiplication on a space @xmath9 without unit . if @xmath9 has an @xmath4 form @xmath33 with @xmath34 , then @xmath9 is a deformation retract of a space @xmath35 with associative multiplication such that the inclusion @xmath36 has an @xmath4 form in the sense of stasheff @xcite .",

    "<S> jim stasheff gave two apparently distinct definitions of an @xmath0 form , @xmath1 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also claimed that the two definitions are equivalent in @xcite , while it is not apparently clear for us . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we are trying to clarify related things and to show that the claim is actually true under a ` loop - like ' hypothesis in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> along with these two definitions , we must construct associahedra and multiplihedra as convex polytopes with piecewise - linearly decomposed faces to manipulate units in @xmath2 form . </S>",
    "<S> this is done in iwase @xcite , iwase - mimura @xcite or by haiman @xcite especially on associahedra , followed recently by forcey @xcite and mau - woodward @xcite , while the origin of associahedra goes back to tamari @xcite . in this paper , we follow @xcite on the geometric constructions of associahedra and multiplihedra . in appendix , we also explain how we can construct associahedra or multiplihedra as polytopes on the ( half ) lattice by taking a shadow or collecting words from trivalent or bearded trees . </S>"
