    "although the standard model ( sm ) is very successful for explaining the particle physics experiments , it has to face the difficulties of many interesting open questions , such ascp violation .",
    "the new experimental results for @xmath7 , which measures direct cp violation in @xmath1 decays , have been reported by ktev collaboration at fermilab@xcite and na48 collaboration at cern@xcite , @xmath9 while the new world average reads@xcite : @xmath10 this establishment of direct cp violation rules out old superweak models@xcite . yet",
    "while the sm predicts a non - vanishing @xmath7 , the values in ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) exceed most theoretical predictions of sm@xcite .",
    "people have to face and resolve this discrepancy . some possibilities to accommodate the data in sm",
    "have been pointed out  @xcite .",
    "the sm makes precise assumptions on the mechanism that generates the cp violation .",
    "the only source of cp violating phase originates from the elements @xmath11 of the ckm matrix with three quark generations . in sm",
    ", there are both indirect ( @xmath12 ) and direct ( @xmath13 ) cp violation.the analysis of @xmath7 can be divided into the short - distance ( perturbative ) part and long - distance ( non - perturbative)part . using the effective hamiltonian , ( @xmath14@xcite ) , one can obtain an expression of @xmath2 that involves ckm parameters ( @xmath11 ) , wilson coefficients ( @xmath15 ) and local operator matrix elements ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the source of most theoretical uncertainties for @xmath7 is mainly from the difficulty in calculating non - perturbative part ( local operator matrix elements ) , comparing with the phenomenological determination of ckm parameters @xcite and the calculation of the wilson coefficients at a nlo leval@xcite . for @xmath2 , one of the goals of sm",
    "is to determine the hadronic matrix elements@xcite .",
    "the interesting in this note is not in this non - perturbative part but the new effects with the fourth sequential generation particles in the short - distance part.except for the sm explanation , there are many directions in the search for new physics beyond the sm @xcite to resolve cp violation . unlike sm ,",
    "almost any extension of sm has , in general , new cp violating phases .",
    "that is to say , they give new cp violation sources .",
    "the new physics on cp violation beyond sm includes cp violation in supersymmetry models@xcite and extensions of fermion sector@xcite , scalar sector@xcite and gauge sector@xcite of sm . in extensions of fermion sector , there are many models , such as vector - like quark models@xcite , sterile neutrino models@xcite , proposed for probing new effects on cp violation .    in this note , like in ref.@xcite , we consider a sequential fourth generation model@xcite , in which an up - type quark @xmath17 , adown - type quark @xmath18 , a lepton @xmath19 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath20 are added into the sm .",
    "the properties of these new fermions are all the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm mixing , see tab.1 ,    .the elementary particle spectrum of sm4 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the numerical results are shown in figs .",
    "2,3,4 which correspond to the three cases of calculating hadronic matrix elements , lattice method , 1/n eapansion , and chiral quark model , respectively .",
    "we now present a study for @xmath21 as functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath21 versus @xmath22 with fixing @xmath24 is plotted in figs .",
    "( a ) ; @xmath21 versus @xmath3 with fixing @xmath22 is ploted in figs .",
    "( b ) ; and the allowed parameter space of @xmath22 and @xmath24 is plotted in figs .",
    "( c ) . we shall analyze each case in detail as follows .    in figs ( a ) we plot eight lines corresponding to @xmath2550 , 100 , 150 , 200 250 , 300 , 350 , 400gev respectively .",
    "first , we notice that the slope of the line decreases as @xmath24 increases . at a value of @xmath24 , about 230gev",
    ", the slope is zero because the second part in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) vanishes .",
    "the reason is similar to that in sm , i.e. , with increasing @xmath24 the ew penguins become increasingly important and their contributions to @xmath26 are with the opposite sign to those of qcd penguins so that at some values of @xmath24 there is a cancellation .",
    "the behavior comes essentially once @xmath24 becomes larger than 230gev , the slope is negative .",
    "its absolute value increases with @xmath24 .",
    "such a behavior comes essentially from the change of the wilson coefficients @xmath27 as @xmath24 .",
    "second , from figs ( a ) , we found , within the constraints on @xmath22 from the three rare @xmath28 meson decays , that @xmath21 can generally be consistent with the experimental average except for some ranges of @xmath24 once the non - perturbative parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are taken values calculated based on the lattice gauge theory and @xmath8 expansion .",
    "such a range roughly ranges from 170gev to 300gev , which can be seen from figs .",
    "( 2a ) and ( 3a ) .",
    "there is no excluded range for the case of the chiral quark model .",
    "this is because in the first two cases , the sm values @xmath31 are about @xmath32 , which is much lower than the experimental average . for a large range of @xmath24 , @xmath33 is not large enough to make total @xmath21 reach the experimental average .",
    "but in the chiral quark model , the sm value is about @xmath34 which is in the @xmath35 error range of the present experimental average so that @xmath21 can reach the experimental average for all values of @xmath24 in the reasonable region .",
    "thus once the non - perturbative method calculations become more reliable and the experimental measurements get more accuracy , it may provide more strong constraints on the forth generation quark from the study on @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , we ca nt get any information on the upper bound of @xmath24 .",
    "we also plot in figs ( b ) eight curves corresponding to @xmath361.0 , 0.75 , 0.5 , 0.25 , -0.25 , -0.5 , -0.75 , -1.0@xmath37 respectively .",
    "thus similar results as those in the figs ( a ) are arrived .",
    "these curves are divided into two types determined by the sign of the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath22 .",
    "the reason is also similar to the analysis for figs .",
    "the figs.(b ) also show the constraints on @xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting to see that there is an excluded region from 0 to @xmath38 based on lattice gauge theory results and from 0 to @xmath39 based on the @xmath8 expansion results . while there is no such an excluded region based on the chiral quark model results .",
    "the reason is the same as that in the analysis of figs ( a ) .",
    "moreover , it seems that @xmath22 favors the negative values which may be interesting since the negative value of @xmath22 is better to satisfy the unitarity constraints of the ckm matrix ( see eq .",
    ". therefore if there could exist the fourth generation , from both the theoretical and the experimental parts , one might be able get usefull information on the fourth generation ckm matrix elements , such as @xmath40 which has been studied in our previous paper@xcite .    in figs .",
    "( c ) , we show the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "the three curves in the figure correspond to the experimental values of the new world average and its @xmath35 error , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the the allowed parameter space is strongly limited for all three cases when the ratio @xmath21 is around the present experimental average within 1 @xmath41 error .",
    "the allowed parameter space is divided into two pieces except in the chiral quark model .",
    "this is in agreement with the analyses in figs .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "such a small parameter space indicates that @xmath21 may impose a very strong constraint on the mass and mixing of the fourth generation up - type quark .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the direct cp - violating parameter @xmath2 in @xmath42 system with considering the up - type quark @xmath43 in sm4 . the basic formulae for @xmath2 in sm4 has been presented and the wilson coefficient functions in the sm4 have also been evaluated .",
    "the numerical results of the additional wilson coefficient functions have been given as functions of the mass @xmath23 .",
    "we have also studied the relevant rare @xmath28 meson decays : two semi - leptonic decays , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and one leptionic decay @xmath46 , which allow us to obtain the bounds on the fourth generation ckm matrix factor @xmath5 . in particular , we have analyzed the numerical result of @xmath2 as the function of @xmath3 and imaginary part of the fourth ckm factor , @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 and a fourth generation ckm matrix phase @xmath6 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 has been studied in detail with different hadronic matrix elements calculated from various approaches , such as lattice gauge method , @xmath8 expansion and chiral quark model .",
    "it has been seen that , unlike the sm , when taking the central values of all parameters , the values of @xmath7 can be easily made to be consistent with the current experimental data for all estimated values of the relevant hadronic matrix elements from various approaches . especially , we have also investigated the allowed parameter space of @xmath24 and @xmath4 , as a consequence , when considering @xmath35-error of the current experimental data for @xmath2 , the allowed parameter space for @xmath24 and @xmath4 is very small and strongly restricted .",
    "this implies that the experimental data in k system can provide strong constraints on the mass of @xmath43-quark and also on the fourth generation quark mixing matrix .",
