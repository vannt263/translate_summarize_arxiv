    "agb mass loss is generally believed to be a two - step process , involving pulsation - driven atmospheric shock waves , followed by radiation pressure on the dust driving the outflow .",
    "the dust production rate , and the eventual dust - to - gas ratio of the ejected material , will depend on the metallicity of the star .",
    "the details of the mass loss may therefore be different for different stellar populations .",
    "existing theoretical formalisms for the mass are generally derived from the reimers mass loss : @xmath3 .",
    "this equation is adjusted to fit existing observations as well as constraints such as the initial  final mass relations .",
    "examples are blcker s law ( @xmath4 ) , vassiliadis &  wood s ( 1993 ) formalism and the relation from judge &  stencel ( @xmath5 ) . because observations of agb mass loss have been largely limited to galactic stars , these formalisms have limited predictive power for different stellar populations .",
    "so far , only bowen & willson ( 1992 ) have attempted to predict mass - loss rates at low @xmath0 from theoretical pulsation models .",
    "the study of extra - galactic mass loss is thus of interest to extend the parameter space of mass loss . at the same time , since the majority of stars with life times less than a hubble time will have passed through the agb , a better understanding of mass loss especially at low @xmath0 is also important for our knowledge on stellar remnants and on the recycling of stellar gas into the ism .",
    "the lack of observational data is mainly due to the difficulty to detect dust at any large distance , and the paucity of dusty agb stars due to the short life time of the superwind phase .",
    "existing and planned instrumentation has the capability to detect agb stars to distances far outside the local group . observations of mass loss of individual agb stars is observationally possible at least for the satellites of the galaxy .",
    "of these , studies of the magellanic clouds have already been initiated ( reid 1991 , wood et al .",

    "the new generation of wide - field infrared arrays is expected to give rapid progress in the next few years",
    ".    evolved agb stars can also be identified through their variability , using i - band observations .",

    "knapp et al . (",
    "1992 ) studied elliptical galaxies in virgo : they showed that on average 40 per cent of their 12-micron emission may be due to circumstellar dust .",
    "the expected photospheric contribution is @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 in jy ) , whereas the observations for virgo ellipticals give @xmath13 .",
    "this is in contrast to globular clusters where the 12-@xmath14 m emission is consistent with purely photospheric emission ( knapp et al .",
    "1995 , penny et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recently , bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have used the padova isochrones to predict integrated ir colours of stellar populations for various mid - infrared bands .",
    "their results rely heavily on assumed relations .",
    "e.g. between @xmath0 and @xmath15 , but can easily be updated if required .",
    "the expansion velocity @xmath16 of the gas is a result of the radiation pressure on the dust , and the drag or coupling between the dust and the gas .",
    "this will depend on several parameters : @xmath15 ( or the optical depth through the envelope ) , the stellar luminosity @xmath17 and the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "habing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) calculated outflow velocities as function of these parameters and showed that @xmath16 reaches a maximum for intermediate values of @xmath15 but continuously increases with @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "however , a very large effect on the dust - to - gas ratio was found : the expansion velocities drop to only a few km / s if the dust - to - gas ratio drops by a factor of 10 compared to agb stars of solar metallicity , although the effect differs in magnitude between carbon and oxygen - rich stars .",
    "few observations of expansion velocities outside the galactic disk are available .",
    "wood et al .",
    "( 1992 ) determined @xmath16 for five oh / ir stars in the lmc .",
    "they found values of only 60% of similar galactic oh / ir stars .",
    "this conclusion however depends on the way @xmath16 is measured : wood et al .",
    "used the two strongest peaks in the oh spectrum which may not be appropriate for noisy spectra . if instead the outermost emission peaks are used , zijlstra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that the four confirmed agb stars have @xmath19 km / s versus the galactic comparison stars @xmath20 km / s , a difference of only 15% .",
    "the fifth star of wood et al . is a luminous supergiant : sio emission showed that in this case the oh was not centred on the stellar velocity and therefore @xmath16 was greatly underestimated ( van loon et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) detected co for one of two mass - losing carbon - miras in the galactic halo .",
    "the star has @xmath21 km / s . in comparison , galactic disk stars average around 10 km / s ( groenewegen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath22 is estimated for the halo carbon star . the very low @xmath16 is qualitatively consistent with the habing et al .",
    "predictions , but further data on halo stars would be required for any conclusions .",
    "the present data suggests that @xmath16 may be lower at subsolar @xmath0 , but quantative information for a range of mass - loss rates and luminosities is lacking .",
    "the difference between the lmc and the galaxy may be less than predicted by habing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but this could easily be due to compensatory effects , such as higher luminosity and/or different pulsation properties in the lmc stars .",
    "the mass - loss formalisms mentioned in the introduction do not include a direct @xmath0-dependence .",
    "as the temperature on the early agb is @xmath0-dependent , this may indirectly introduce lower mass - loss rates at lower @xmath0 .",
    "( for the mass - losing part of the agb we do not have data on how the temperature scale depends on @xmath0 . ) on the other hand , the formalisms were not designed for different metallicities and can not be used for predictions .",
    "if the mass loss is driven by radiation pressure on dust , a possibly quite large effect could be expected .",
    "there are a number of observations of mass loss at low @xmath0 . up",
    "to 50 mass - losing agb stars are now known in the lmc , with several having sufficiently high mass - loss rates to have significant extinction even at k. zijlstra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) conclude that for these stars , there is no evidence that @xmath15 in the lmc is systematically lower than in the galaxy .",
    "also the smc stars in their sample show no such effect .",
    "groenewegen &  blommaert ( 1998 ) find evidence for further highly obscured agb in the smc which also exhibit high mass - loss rates similar to those of galactic oh / ir stars .",
    "further data comes from mira variables in globular clusters and in the galactic halo .",
    "groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derive dust mass - loss rates of a few @xmath23 for two distant halo miras with low z. mira variables in 47 tuc and omega cen have been detected at 12 @xmath14 m and show similar mass - loss rates ( gillet et al .",
    "1988 , origlia et al . , 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "the corresponding gas mass - loss rates are of order @xmath24 ( origlia et al .",
    "derive much lower values but these are based on a reimers law .",
    "their dust detection implies a much higher rate . )",
    "frogel &  elias ( 1988 ) find from a more complete sample an _ average _",
    "@xmath25 for long - period variables in globular clusters with [ fe / h]@xmath26 .",
    "thus , variables in globular clusters show mass - loss rates within normal ranges . it should be noted that a correction may have to be made if the expansion velocities are very low .",
    "the data , within the limited accuracy , shows no evidence for low mass - loss rates at low @xmath0 .",
    "this may be related to the fact that an agb star will continue to evolve to higher luminosities untill the mass - loss rate exceeds the nuclear - burning rate .",
    "if mass loss is less efficient at low @xmath0 , the star will reach higher luminosity which will again increase the mass - loss rate ( habing et al .",
    "thus , stars in different populations are likely to reach similar mass - loss rates , but may do so at different phases in their evolution ( bowen &  willson 1991 ) .",
    "an important result obtained from extra - galactic agb stars is the existence of a well - defined period ",
    "luminosity relation for miras in the lmc .",
    "the relation was discovered by glass &  evans ( 1981 ) .",
    "feast et al .",
    "( 1989 ) showed that the relation is especially narrow ( 1-@xmath27mag ) when using the k - band .",
    "not all miras follow the @xmath1 relation .",
    "lmc miras with periods longer than 400 days tend to be overluminous ( e.g. zijlstra et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , oh / ir stars near the galactic centre appear underluminous ( blommaert et al .",
    "1998 , wood et al . 1998 ) , although there are uncertainties in the bolometric corrections .",
    "a few nearby miras are also underluminous ( van leeuwen et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "bedding &  zijlstra ( 1998 ) show that nearby miras and semi - regulars ( sr ) with accurate hipparcos parallaxes define three sequences : one sequence agrees with the lmc mira @xmath1 relation , a broader sequence contains sr variables which is shifted by about a factor of two towards shorter periods ( e.g. wood & sebo 1996 ) , and a few stars fall well below the relation .",
    "( a number of semiregulars show two periods , one of which agrees with the mira relation and the other with the less narrow sr sequence . ) the few stars below the relation have luminosities similar to the semiregulars ( although having much longer periods ) and may be evolutionary related to this group .",
    "the miras show slightly higher luminosities and appear therefore more evolved .",
    "the luminosity difference between sr s and miras is consistent with an evolution along a whitelock ( 1986 ) track . from the hipparcos data ,",
    "life times of the order of @xmath28 yr can be estimated for the mira phase and similar or larger for the sr s .",
    "wood ( 1990 ) predicts that the @xmath1 relation should depend on @xmath0 , with galactic miras being less luminous at k by 0.25@xmath29mag compared to lmc miras of the same period ( or , galactic miras have longer periods ) .",
    "this is however not confirmed by available observations ( e.g. , van leeuwen et al .",
    "1997 , feast 1996 , whitelock et al .",
    "alvarez et al . ( 1998 ) find some evidence for an offset between the hipparcos miras and the lmc @xmath1 relation , but the more accurate data of bedding &  zijlstra ( 1998 ) does not confirm this .",
    "figure 1 compares the lmc miras with hipparcos miras and with globular cluster miras .",
    "the hipparcos miras ( open circles ) all have parallax uncertainties less than 15% , and the resulting lutz ",
    "kelker bias is less than 0.05 mag ( koen 1992 ) .",
    "a direct fit between the lmc and hipparcos miras ( applying a bias correction according to koen 1992 ) gives an lmc distance modulus of @xmath30 , not inconsistent with other determinations .",
    "a shift of 0.25 mag would put the lmc at an unlikely distance of @xmath31 and seems excluded .",
    "globular clusters are shown in figure 1 as triangles .",
    "all occur in clusters with @xmath32>0.1 $ ] ( whitelock 1986 ) . to scale the data , two horizontal branch distance scales of harris ( 1996 ) are used , a short scale ( derived from rr lyare statistical parallaxes ) and a long one ( field subdwarfs ) .",
    "the average scale corresponds to @xmath33 + 0.85 $ ] .",
    "the bottom panel uses the chaboyer ( 1998 ) relation @xmath34 + 1.6)+0.46 $ ] which again is 0.1mag brighter than an average including the statistical parallax .",
    "it is clear that only the brightest scale gives good agreement with the mira @xmath1 relation",
    ". a direct fit to the lmc data using the harris scale gives @xmath33 + 0.60\\pm0.03 $ ] .",
    "( this would yield globular cluster ages of 11 + /-2 gyr . )",
    "there is thus little evidence for a dependence of the @xmath1 relation on @xmath0 , when using k - band magnitudes .",
    "if the relation is indeed invariant , it would make mira variables a highly useful distance indicator .",
    "the postion of a mira in the @xmath1 diagram is determined by the core - mass  luminosity relation and by the pulsation equation :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the period in days , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the radius and mass in solar units and @xmath39 is the pulsation constant . using the agb relation of wood ( 1990 ) :    @xmath40    ( where the disturbance term @xmath41 is usually ignored ) , one finds ( feast 1996 ) :    @xmath42    here @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of a narrow @xmath1 relation implies @xmath36 is not an independent parameter : @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is not _ a priori _ known for an lmc star but may vary between stars of different ages .",
    "@xmath38 is not constant , due to mass loss .",
    "in addition , @xmath46 is _ independently from @xmath38 _ determined by the core mass , but will change by as much as 1 mag over the phase of the thermal - pulse cycle .",
    "these separate effects should lead to a large broadening of the @xmath1 relation ( e.g. vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) . from the narrow @xmath1 relation we find :    @xmath47    valid during the mass loss phase .",
    "( the second relation is the observed @xmath1 relation . ) to keep a star on the @xmath1 relation during the mira phase , the stellar radius must adjust to compensate for the changing luminosity and mass . the agb relation above , valid for the earlier agb , may thus not fully describe miras .",
    "the observed radius is wavelength dependent , due to molecular bands in the extended atmosphere .",
    "this re - introduces a metallicity effect , seen as a colour term dependent on @xmath45 ( feast 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 relation is best defined at k , where the atmospheric bands do not contribute and the observed radius is closest to the photospheric radius .",
    "a possible explanation for the relations above is a feedback between the stellar pulsations and mass loss .",
    "such a mechanism could break down either at high luminosities or at high mass - loss rates , where the latter could correspond to the underluminous stars at the galactic centre .",
    "the agb mass - loss formalisms include an @xmath37-dependence . using the @xmath48 relation of iben ( 1984 ) for the agb",
    "predicts that a low-@xmath45 agb star will have a slightly lower @xmath15 at the same luminosity . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the reimers mass loss would be 20%  lower . to compensate",
    ", a low-@xmath45 star would require a higher luminosity ( and therefore a higher core mass ) to reach the same @xmath15 .",
    "assuming the evolution is terminated when @xmath15 exceeds the nuclear burning rate , a low-@xmath45 star is expected to reach a higher final core mass and thus yield a more massive white dwarf than a star with the same initial mass but higher @xmath45 .    for @xmath50 ,",
    "the effect of radiation pressure of dust becomes very small and the mass loss is probably purely driven by the stellar pulsation .",
    "for such a dustless wind , bowen &  willson ( 1991 ) find that @xmath51 should be 0.3 mag brighter to reach the same mass loss as a dusty wind .",
    "the total increase in brightness as function of @xmath0 to reach the same mass - loss rates is @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .",
    "the core mass  luminosity relation @xmath54 ( e.g. boothroyd &  sackman 1988 ) can be used to quantify the effect on the final mass of the resulting white dwarf .",
    "the required increase is very small for low core mass , but becomes significant for core masses corresponding to the heaviest white dwarfs .",
    "we use an approximate present initial  final mass relation of @xmath55 , and a salpeter imf @xmath56 .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting @xmath57@xmath58 relation as function of @xmath45 . at @xmath59 ,",
    "the heaviest remnants reach the chandresekhar mass giving rise to a class of agb supernovae . at the extreme @xmath45 ,",
    "the contribution of these agb - sn exceed the type ii sn by a factor of a few , over the first gyr of the stellar population .",
    "if confirmed , such an effect would have dramatic consequences for the evolution of the earliest stellar populations in the high - redshift universe .",
