    "the current paradigm of attempting to develop various kinds of nanoscopic devices requires careful consideration of the phase behavior of nanosystems , since in nanoscopic geometries effects due to external walls or other boundaries of the system can modify its `` bulk '' behavior substantially . qualitatively new kinds of phenomena may occur , that have not yet been studied for macroscopic bulk systems .",
    "we demonstrate a new kind of phase transition in the present paper , which belongs to the class of interface localization - delocalization phenomena , using the simple ising ferromagnet with nearest - neighbor exchange on a cubic lattice as a generic example . choosing a compact octahedral shape of the system in the form of a bi - pyramid of height 2l",
    ", we assume that on the upper surfaces of the pyramid ( @xmath4 ) a positive surface magnetic field @xmath5 acts , while on the lower surfaces ( with @xmath6 ) the field is negative but of the same absolute strength , so that no sign of the magnetization is overall preferred . more generally , one might consider the case with positive and negative fields of different strength ; their difference , however , could be effectively compensated by a suitably chosen bulk field such that at low temperatures again a degeneracy with respect to the sign of the spontaneous magnetization is possible , similar to the case of `` capillary condensation''-type phenomena in semi - infinite thin films @xcite .",
    "in this case one can also expect an interesting interplay between the wetting behavior of the semi - infinite system and the phase behavior in confinement , a complication that is not considered in the present manuscript .",
    "such a system is then described ( for @xmath7 ) by an order parameter ( the spontaneous magnetization of the ising ferromagnet ) , which does _ not _ remain non - zero up to the critical temperature @xmath8 of the bulk three - dimensional model , but rather only up to a temperature @xmath9 , identical with the ( critical ) temperature of the filling transition @xcite in a single semi - infinite pyramid .",
    "as will be discussed in this paper , this new kind of phase transition @xcite in the limit @xmath10 can be either of first order or of second order , depending on the value of the line tension , which describes @xcite the free energy excess associated with the contact line where the interface separating oppositely oriented domains meets the free surface ( or inert wall that confines the system , respectively ) .",
    "of course , as long as the linear dimension l of the system is large but finite , finite - size rounding of this phase transition needs to be considered , and hence we shall present a tentative generalization of the theory of finite size scaling @xcite to the present situation here .    a qualitative explanation of this new transition is sketched in fig .",
    "it is assumed that the surface magnetic field strength @xmath11 is small enough , so that for zero temperature the ground state of the system has a uniform ( positive or negative ) magnetization , in spite of the unfavorable energy cost due to the surfaces ( or walls , respectively ) where the surface magnetic field is oppositely oriented to the direction of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the interfacial free energy @xmath12 between oppositely oriented domains decreases faster than the excess free energy difference , @xmath13 , of a positively oriented domain between surfaces with @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known the interfacial free energy @xmath12 vanishes at the bulk critical temperature @xmath8 according to a power law @xmath14 with the correlation length critical exponent @xcite @xmath15 . at the temperature @xmath9 , these surface free energies become equal , and",
    "hence for @xmath16 it is energetically favorable to have a state with two oppositely magnetized domains , separated by an interface located in the basal plane of the bi - pyramid ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . of course , in the actual calculation of @xmath9 not only the surface free energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( per unit area ) matter , but one must also consider the fact that the four triangular surfaces take a larger area ( depending on the opening angle @xmath17 of the pyramids ) than the area of the interface . in this work ,",
    "we consider explicitly only the case @xmath18 , so that the surfaces of the bi - pyramid meet at the basal plane at an angle of @xmath19 , but it is clear that the general features of the phenomena described here do not depend on this particular choice . in fact , we speculate that also the choice of planar surfaces is an irrelevant detail , and similar behavior could be observed for other geometries such as double - cones with different surface fields on the upper and lower portion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recall the basic facts about the filling transition in semi - infinite cones , and develop a tentative phenomenological theory for describing the transition explained in fig .",

    "finally sec .",
    "iv contains our conclusions , and discusses briefly the extension to phase transitions of other systems ( gas - liquid systems , binary mixtures , etc . ) in related geometries .",
    "in this section two complementary phenomenological approaches to the phase transition in a double - pyramid are developed . in subsection",
    "a we use the description of the filling of a single cone @xcite .",
    "this yields the location of the filling transition in the limit @xmath20 and we discuss modifications due to the double - pyramid geometry .",
    "this approach is expected to yield a good description if the magnetization is close to its saturation value , i.e. , for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the reduced distance from the filling transition .",
    "the role of fluctuations within this context is considered in subsection b. then , in subsection c , we develop a phenomenological landau - type theory for the case that the interface fluctuates around the basal plane .",
    "this approach is able to describe the behavior in the ultimate vicinity of the transition , @xmath23 , and the fluctuations above the transition .",
    "our phenomenological description assumes that the theory of cone filling @xcite can be directly applied to the filling of a semi - infinite pyramid ( i.e. , we ignore the excess free energy at the edges of the pyramid , where the contact lines of the interface with two triangular pyramid surfaces meet ) .",
    "we compare the bi - pyramid geometry to an equivalent situation of a semi - infinite single pyramid , and consider the case when the interface is located at a height @xmath24 above the bottom corner    ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we write the free energy of the semi - infinite pyramid , relative to a state with no interface , in terms of surface and line free energies @xmath25 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , we have used the geometrical factors appropriate for the opening angle @xmath26 ( a generalization in terms of other choices for the angle @xmath17 is straightforward ) , and we have also suppressed temperature arguments throughout , in order to simplify the notation . actually , rather than using the temperature , @xmath27 , as a control parameter as assumed in fig .",

    "this transition occurs in the way described here only if the parts of the surface where the surface field has the same sign are all adjacent to each other .",
    "e.g. , for a bi - pyramid with boundary condition where the sign of the surface field alternates from one triangular surface to the adjacent one on the same pyramid , this condition would be violated , and no such phase transition occurs : rather one observes only a rounded phase transition near the bulk transition point @xcite .",
    "2 .   as described in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in the thermodynamic limit the transition can be described in analogy with bulk first order transitions , where an intersection of the two branches of the free energy which describe the phases occurs .",
    "however , here , both branches are surface free energies , scaling like the surface area ( @xmath359 ) rather than the volume ( @xmath360 ) .",

    "the region of bulk fields , where this divergence is observable , shrinks to zero like @xmath179 , because the critical amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) varies like @xmath73 .",
    "there is a remarkable asymmetry between the behavior of the susceptibility in the regime @xmath303 ( where no total magnetization occurs ) and the regime @xmath41 , however : in the latter regime , the total magnetization @xmath364 essentially reaches its saturation value in the interval @xmath365 , and this is the same regime over which the curie - weiss - like divergence of the susceptibility is rounded off . for @xmath366 , however , @xmath367 is almost identical to its saturation value , and the susceptibility converges towards the ( small ) susceptibility of a bulk ising system , independent of size .",
    "the maximum value of the susceptibility scales like the system volume , @xmath368 , as in a first order transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]c ) , but unlike the latter the shape of the susceptibility maximum does not converge to a delta - function singularity ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]b ) .",
    "a very special behavior is detected for the probability distribution of the order parameter ( figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) . on a scale of @xmath369 the shape of this",
    "distribution changes from a single gaussian peak ( for @xmath42 ) to a double peak distribution ( for @xmath41 ) , and the inverse width @xmath336 vanishes linearly with @xmath11 as @xmath34 is approached from above ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig11]a ) .",
    "this transition from single to double peak shape happens via distribution @xmath370 $ ] , with a coefficient @xmath348 that is _ independent _ of @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig12]a ) .",
    "this broadness of the distribution implies that in the limit @xmath10 at @xmath32 fluctuations of the magnetization occur which have a macroscopic , size - independent amplitude .",
    "the standard statement of statistical thermodynamics , that in the thermodynamic limit the relative magnitude of fluctuations @xmath371 is negligibly small is not at all true here .",
    "again the behavior is completely different from a standard first - order transition : at the latter , the system would jump between @xmath311 and @xmath372 and @xmath373 , whereas at the pathological second order transition found here the magnetization can fluctuate over a finite fraction of the interval between @xmath374 and @xmath373 , characterized by the distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig12]a . at a first order transition",
    ", we would instead have three delta functions ( at @xmath375 and @xmath311 , respectively ) as an order parameter distribution .",
    "however , this particular behavior is easily accounted for by the landau - type theory of sec .",
    "ii . in particular , for @xmath41 the simulations confirm the behavior @xmath376 near the minimum at @xmath311 ( fig .  [ fig12]c ) . 5 .   in the regime for @xmath41 , when the system is large enough so that @xmath377 is close to its saturation value @xmath111 , the variation of the interface distance @xmath38 counted from one of the corners is found to go as @xmath361 , as predicted by parry et al . @xcite .",
    "when @xmath24 becomes comparable to @xmath378 , this divergence is rounded off , as expected from the behavior of @xmath211 , since then a crossover from the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite to the behavior described by our landau - like theory occurs .",
    "however , the detailed behavior in this crossover regions is not yet fully understood .",
    "we now discuss the extent to which similar behavior can be expected to be found for real systems , such as the liquid - gas transition in a suitable cavity , where half of the surface area has an energetic preference for the liquid ( such that `` incomplete wetting '' of the liquid at the wall occurs ) and the other half prefers the gas ( i.e. , an `` incomplete drying '' boundary condition ) . in this case one",
    "neither has a precise symmetry between liquid and gas in the bulk , nor can one expect a precise antisymmetry between the interactions at the two types of walls . therefore the phase transitions will be shifted somewhat away from the chemical potential value at which phase coexistence can occur in the bulk .",
    "a similar smooth interpolation between `` capillary condensation''-like behavior and `` interface localization - delocalization '' transitions has also been found for a model of a polymer blend in a thin film geometry confined between parallel plates at which surface fields act which do not have a particular symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is encouraging that wetting phenomena in systems where chemically distinct substrates meet find increasing theoretical @xcite and experimental attention@xcite .",
    "an important constraint though is that for the fluids one has to consider the grand - canonical ensemble where the fluid in the cavity can exchange particles with a reservoir , and similarly for the binary fluid in the cavity also exchanges @xmath379 or vice versa must be possible , due to a connection with a suitable reservoir . if one considers a fluid in a cavity with a fixed total number of fluid particles , or a binary mixture in a cavity with fixed relative concentration , this transition of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is completely suppressed : this situation would correspond to an ising system at constant total magnetization , and hence by construction fluctuations of the uniform magnetization then are impossible . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] then the configuration with an interface present in the basal plane of the bi - pyramid is enforced at all temperatures .",
    "an interesting aspect is also the crossover between the transition studied here and the standard critical behavior near the bulk critical temperature ( a crossover from wetting to critical adsorption@xcite ) .    :",
