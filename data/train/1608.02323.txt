    "hybrid phase transitions ( hpts ) have been observed in diverse models on complex networks , for instance , @xmath0-core percolation  @xcite , the cascading failure ( cf ) model  @xcite on interdependent networks and a synchronization model  @xcite .",
    "those models have provided some basic idea to understand drastic changing phenomena in real - world complex systems such as jamming transitions  @xcite , blackout of power - grid systems  @xcite and so on . in the above two percolation models",
    "@xcite , as nodes or links are removed one by one from a certain control parameter value @xmath1 above a transition point @xmath2 , the order parameter decreases continuously , but it also displays discontinuous feature at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the order parameter @xmath3 behaves as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants , and @xmath7 is the critical exponent of the order parameter . the hybrid behavior of the order parameter was mainly issued in early researches . however , recently divergent behaviors of the fluctuations of the order parameter and of the correlation size ( i.e. , the number of nodes correlated ) at the transition point and scaling relations have also been focused  @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents associated with those quantities @xmath8 , respectively were defined . on the other hand ,",
    "when a node is deleted , it can trigger cascading failures . in the critical region ,",
    "the avalanche size distribution follows a power law as @xmath9 with @xmath10 ; however , the cluster size distribution does not exhibit power - law behavior .",
    "this feature is unconventional from the perspective of the percolation theory for the ordinary percolation  @xcite .",
    "the power - law behavior in the avalanche dynamics yields another type of critical behavior , which requires another set of the exponents @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "it reveals that for the cf model , the critical exponents in the set for the order parameter satisfy scaling relations by themselves but those in the set of the avalanche dynamics do not satisfy hyperscaling relations .",
    "moreover , the two sets of the exponents are not completely independent , but they are coupled as @xmath12 .",
    "it was proposed that a discontinuous percolation transition can not occur when its occupation rule is local  @xcite . however , when more than one species of particles cooperatively occupy each node , a discontinuous percolation transition can occur even though the dynamic rule is local  @xcite . along these lines ,",
    "the conventional susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sir ) model , which exhibits a continuous percolation transition , was generalized in several forms to produce a discontinuous phase transition or hpt  @xcite .",
    "one model introduced in @xcite ( called the swir model ) contains an intermediate state called the weakened state ( symbolized as w ) between susceptible state ( s ) and infectious state ( i ) .",
    "a node in state w becomes more easily infected than others in state s , so the reaction changes rapidly to the recovered state r , leading to a discontinuous transition  @xcite .",
    "another model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite allows the occupations of two pathogens i@xmath13 and i@xmath14 on each node instead of single pathogen i. when a node is in the two - pathogen state , it can more easily change its state to state r , which leads to a discontinuous transition .",
    "recent studies of both of these generalized contagion models focused on the behavior of the order parameter using the local tree approximation",
    ". however , to understand the critical behavior of the hpt thoroughly , one needs to check whether other physical quantities such as the susceptibility and the correlation size conform to the conventional critical properties and thus whether their exponents satisfy the scaling relations or not . to check the criticality , here",
    "we investigate the behavior of the order parameter and the scaling relations of the critical exponents for the swir model  @xcite .",
    "we find that the order parameter does not follow the formula ( [ order ] ) ; further , the fluctuation of the order parameter does not diverge .",
    "thus the order parameter does not exhibit the feature of the hpt .",
    "however , the probability @xmath15 that a macroscopic - scale outbreak ( called an infinite outbreak hereafter ) occurs as a function of the infection probability @xmath1 exhibits a critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "an infinite outbreak is required for the order parameter to jump from zero to a finite value .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the probability @xmath15 is nothing but the spanning probability of the percolation .",
    "thus , the critical exponents of the ordinary percolation @xmath16 govern the critical behavior of the swir model .    from a single source of epidemic spreading , finite outbreaks can occur and their sizes ( corresponding to finite avalanche sizes in the cf model ) are heterogeneous according to a power law @xmath17 , where @xmath10 and @xmath18 with @xmath2 being a transition point . using finite size scaling analysis , we can obtain the critical exponents @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the two sets of critical exponents @xmath16 and @xmath20 represent the critical behavior of the swir model .",
    "because the order parameter does not exhibit critical behavior , @xmath21 and the exponents associated with the diverging behaviors @xmath22 and @xmath23 reduce @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the type of phase transition of the swir is mixed - order phase transition ( mot ) .",
    "the critical exponents of the ordinary percolation govern the critical behavior of the mot of the swir model",
    ".    it may be worth recalling that for the mots observed in other physical models , for instance , the ising model in one dimension with long - range interaction following the inverse - square law between two spins within the same domain  @xcite and a dna denaturation model  @xcite , the order parameter does not follow formula ( [ order ] ) but jumps discontinuously without exhibiting a critical behavior at a transition point , whereas the susceptibility and the correlation length diverge , as they appear in the second - order transitions .",
    "thus , the mot in the swir model exhibits features similar to those of the above models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the swir model . in sec .",
    "iii , we set up the self - consistency equation to derive the mean - field solution of the order parameter for the epidemic transition on the erds and rnyi ( er ) networks .",
    "we find that depending on the mean degree of the er network , different types of phase transition can occur . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the properties of those diverse phase transitions . in the final section , a summary and discussion are presented .",
    "we first define the reactions of the swir model as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the contagion rates of the respective reactions between the states of neighboring nodes . for instance , a node in state s can change its state when it contacts with a node in state i to either state i with a probability @xmath31 , or state w with a probability @xmath32 .",
    "the main use of this swir model is to determine how fast disease spreads on a macroscopic scale with respect to the recovery rate @xmath30 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we set @xmath33 . on the other hand , when @xmath28 and @xmath29 are much smaller than @xmath27",
    ", the model reduces to the sir model .",
    "thus , we focus on the opposite limit : the reaction rates of ( [ si_wi ] ) and ( [ wi_ii ] ) are dominant compared with that of ( [ si_ii ] ) .",
    "thus , we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath28 serves as a control parameter . for convenience",
    ", we will use the control parameter in an alternative form @xmath36 , which is the reaction probability of ( [ si_wi ] ) .",
    "initially , there exist a single infectious node ( seed ) , the location of which is chosen at random and @xmath37 susceptible nodes .",
    "we then successively choose which reaction will occur next and when it will occur .",
    "the simulation rule is presented in detail in appendix b. this process is repeated until no infectious nodes remain in the system .",
    "this state is called absorbing state . here",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the outbreak size of epidemics , i.e. , the fraction of nodes in state r after the system reaches an absorbing state , which serves as the order parameter , denoted as @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the susceptibility , i.e. , the fluctuation of the order parameter defined as @xmath39 averaged over the ensemble is considered as a function of @xmath1 . using finite - size scaling analysis , we will study phase transitions . +",
    "in an absorbing state , each node is in one of three states , the susceptible s , weakened w and recovered r states .",
    "we consider the probability @xmath40 that a randomly selected node is in state s after it contacts @xmath41 neighbors in state r. this probability means that the node remains in state s even though it has been in contact @xmath41 times with those @xmath41 neighbors in state i before they changed their states to r. thus we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath1 is the reaction probability given as @xmath43 with @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "next , @xmath44 is similarly defined as the probability that a randomly selected node in state w after it contacts @xmath41 neighbors in state r. the probability @xmath45 is given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the probability of the reaction ( [ wi_ii ] ) , given as @xmath48 .",
    "finally , @xmath49 is the probability that a node is in state r after it contacts @xmath41 neighbors in state r in the absorbing state . using the relation @xmath50",
    ", one can determine @xmath49 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath3 that a randomly chosen node is in state r after the system falls into an absorbing state is given as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the probability that a node has degree @xmath0 and @xmath55 is the probability that an arbitrarily chosen edge leads to a node in state r in the absorbing state .",
    "using the local tree approximation , we define @xmath56 similarly to @xmath55 but now at the tree level @xmath57 .",
    "the probability @xmath58 can be derived from @xmath56 as follows : @xmath59 where the factor @xmath60 is the probability that a node connected to a randomly chosen edge has degree @xmath0 . as a particular case ,",
    "when the network is an er network having a degree distribution that follows the poisson distribution , i.e. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean degree , the function @xmath63 is reduced as follows :    @xmath64    eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce ] ) reduces to a self - consistency equation for @xmath55 for a given reaction rate @xmath1 in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "once we obtain the solution of @xmath55 , we can obtain the outbreak size @xmath3 using eq .",
    "( [ rho_r ] ) . for er networks",
    ", however , @xmath3 becomes equivalent to @xmath55 so that the solution of the self - consistency equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce ] ) yields the order parameter .",
    "we remark that the method we used is similar conceptually to those used in previous studies of epidemic spreading on complex networks  @xcite .    for convenience ,",
    "we define a function @xmath66 . using formula ( [ eq : f_q ] ) , we approximate @xmath67 in the limit @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . because @xmath74 , @xmath75 can change sign only across @xmath76 in the range @xmath77 . however , because @xmath78 as @xmath79 , we limit our investigation to the range @xmath80 hereafter , so that @xmath75 is always negative . for convenience ,",
    "we neglect the higher order terms and redefine @xmath67 as @xmath81    depending on the relative magnitude between @xmath82 and @xmath6 , various solutions of the self - consistency equation @xmath83 can exist .",
    "however , we need to check whether those solutions are indeed physically relevant in the steady state when we start epidemic dynamics from the given initial condition .",
    "we set up the stability criterion as follows : we impose a small perturbation to the steady state solution @xmath84 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce ] ) .",
    "then we can obtain the recursive equation as @xmath85 which leads to @xmath86 if @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , then the steady state solution @xmath84 is stable ( unstable ) .",
