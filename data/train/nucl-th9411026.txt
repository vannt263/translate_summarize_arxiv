    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the underlying theory of strong interactions , with quarks and gluons as fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in the non - perturbative region of low and medium energy physics , mesons and baryons definitely keep their importance as efficient , collective degrees of freedom for a wide range of nuclear phenomena .",
    "there is a widespread view that a successful effective field theory in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom should have the same symmetries as qcd .",
    "chiral symmetry , in the limit of vanishing quark masses , is an exact qcd symmetry ; chiral perturbation theory@xcite is an effective field theory in terms of the light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 ) , the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "it is important to realize that such an effective field theory is mathematically eqivalent to qcd . at sufficiently low energies , smaller than the qcd mass scale of about 1gev",
    ", it leads to a systematic expansion of effective lagrangians and scattering amplitudes in powers of momenta and quark masses ( the latter arise from the symmetry breaking terms ) .",
    "of course , the effectiveness ( as a fastly converging scheme ) of chiral perturbation theory is by definition restricted to quite low energies .",
    "moreover , a perturbational method can only work if the interactions are weak , which is the case for reactions involving the goldstone bosons as external particles .",
    "given these constraints , chiral perturbation theory is remarkably successful ; for a review , see e.g.  the recent article by meissner@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for baryon - baryon and baryon - antibaryon interactions strong correlation effects appear already at threshold ; it is hard to get such effects from an expansion which , for practical reasons , has to be limited to low orders .",
    "furthermore , higher - mass mesons , especially vector mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , play an important role . in my opinion",
    ", a successful description requires to treat both dynamical mechanisms explicitly , as will be discussed below .",
    "let me start by looking at present chiral treatments of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) system .",
    "recently , quite a lot of papers have appeared dealing with this issue . whereas refs .   concentrated on the chiral structure of a specific contribution to the @xmath0 interaction , namely @xmath6-exchange , ref .",
    "@xcite presented a `` complete '' @xmath0 potential strictly obeying chiral symmetry .",
    "it is based on the most general effective chiral lagrangian involving low momentum pions , nonrelativistic nucleons and @xmath7-isobars , and is considered up to third order ( @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a typical external momentum and @xmath10 the qcd mass scale ) in the chiral expansion , thus containing tree as well as one - loop diagrams .",
    "08.5 cm    in diagrammatic terms , the resulting @xmath0 potential has the structure shown in fig .",
    "it consists of one - pion - exchange ( ope ) and @xmath6-exchange terms with @xmath11 and @xmath7 intermediate states .",
    "there are additional @xmath6-exchange processes in the chiral approach ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) involving the @xmath12 vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ figi ] ) , whose presence is dictated by chiral symmetry .",
    "however , due to partial cancellations ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) they are actually quite small , much smaller e.g.  than `` @xmath13''- exchange representing correlated @xmath6-exchange in the scalar - isoscalar channel , which provides the main part ( about @xmath14 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the @xmath0 intermediate range attraction .",
    "the chiral approach absorbs this contribution together with other important pieces involving vector ( @xmath15 ) mesons into the contact terms , i.e. terms of zero range ( last diagram of fig .",
    "[ figi ] ) . in order to solve the corresponding schroedinger equation",
    "a gaussian cutoff function , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , has been used .",
    "results for some low ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) @xmath0 partial wave phase shifts are shown in fig .",
    "[ figii ] ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in comparison to those obtained from the ( full ) bonn potential@xcite . in addition",

    ". a combined look at the @xmath24-parameter and deuteron parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath25 ) is instructive since both measure the size of the @xmath0 tensor force . obviously , in the present chiral model",
    ", the energy dependence of this piece is not realistic since the deuteron values are too low whereas the @xmath24-values grow too fast with increasing energy .",
    "there are two possible sources for this discrepancy : first , the chiral expansion introduces a polynomial momentum dependence , with adjustable parameters , at the @xmath26 vertex ; it should be checked by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite whether their parametrization chosen is in reasonable agreement with the known monopole structure of the @xmath26 formfactor , see section 4 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1-exchange provides an important contribution to the tensor force ( see section 3 ) reaching out well into intermediate @xmath0 distances of @xmath27 .",
    "it is highly questionable whether this piece ( as well as `` @xmath13 '' and @xmath2 exchange ) can be sufficiently represented by zero - range contact terms .    in my opinion , in present chiral approaches to the @xmath0 system , the price you pay ( having to treat important contributions in a very rough way ) is too high for what you get ( a strict chirally symmetric @xmath28 derived from a systematic expansion ) .",
    "it is well known that the physics of `` @xmath13 '' and @xmath1 exchange , so important in the @xmath0 system , is mainly built up by correlated @xmath6-exchange .",
    "( for a recent dynamical model suitable for the discussion of medium modifications , see the paper by kim et al.@xcite . ) therefore , in principle , the chiral approach can take such effects , at least to some extent , into account by going to still higher orders in the chiral expansion , at the expense of getting additional open parameters .",
    "the importance of @xmath1-exchange for the dynamics of the @xmath0 system derives from the following fact : it provides a sizable tensor force , which has opposite sign to the tensor force generated by one - pion - exchange , see fig .",
    "thus there is a strong cancellation , over a relatively broad range of energies and distances , between @xmath3 and @xmath1 exchange in the tensor channel .",
    "a similar cancelation occurs in the strange sector , between @xmath4 and @xmath29 exchange , e.g.  in the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath0 ( and in the baryon - baryon system in general ) it is strongly suggested to always group @xmath3 and @xmath1 ( as well as @xmath4 and @xmath29 ) together in order to reach sufficient convergence in the expansion of the irreducible kernel ( potential ) . to single out @xmath3-exchange as done in the chiral approach might be more systematic from a formal point of view ; on the other hand , by putting @xmath1-exchange into the contact terms , one essentially loses the strong convergence - generating mechanism at intermediate distances provided by @xmath1-exchange .",
    "thus , from a physical standpoint , it appears mandatory to treat @xmath3 and @xmath1 exchange on an equal footing .",
    "4.5 cm    in fact , this procedure has been an essential guideline when constructing the bonn potential .",
    "unfortunately ( though for understandable reasons , see below ) it was not followed to a sufficient degree : whereas , in second - order diagrams ( cp.fig .",
    "[ figviii ] ) @xmath30 as well as @xmath31 exchange have been included for uncorrelated processes ( with @xmath11 and @xmath7 intermediate states ) this has not been done for correlated processes : correlated @xmath6-exchange processes have been included ( in terms of sharp - mass @xmath32 and @xmath1 exchange ) but correlated @xmath31 processes have been left out .",
    "the reason is quite simple : the evaluation of this missing piece is technically quite complicated , much more involved ( due to the spin of the @xmath1 ) compared to correlated @xmath6-exchange .",
    "more importantly , a dynamical model for the interaction between a @xmath3 and a @xmath1 meson was not available .    at the time of the construction of the bonn potential ( about 10 years ago )",
    "the omission of this piece did not seem to be serious .",
    "@xmath0 scattering data in a broad energy range as well as the deuteron data are described quantitatively with the full bonn model .",
    "so why care about a missing piece whose practical relevance was not at all obvious ?",
    "soon after the publication of the bonn potential in 1987 it became however clear that omission of correlated @xmath31 exchange demanded a high price , and this has to do with the structure of the @xmath26 vertex .",
    "basic ingredients of the bonn meson exchange @xmath0 model@xcite are the meson - baryon couplings or vertex functions visualized in fig .",
    "[ figix ] .",
    "these vertex functions are the `` elementary '' building blocks of an effective and consistent meson exchange description based on qcd .",
    "4.50 cm    the analytic structure of these couplings is ( essentially ) determined by the quantum numbers of the particles involved at the vertex .",
    "the strength is parametrized by coupling constants @xmath33 ; in addition , formfactors with cutoff masses @xmath34 as additional parameters are included , which parametrize the effect of the hadron extension and therefore represent a truly physical concept . in general",
    ", the formfactor depends on all four - momenta of the particles involved at the vertex , i.e.  @xmath35  and is normalized to 1 when all particles are on the mass shell .",
    "while ultimately these formfactors have to be derived from qcd they are for the moment parametrized , usually in monopole form , keeping the dependence on the momentum of the exchanged particle only . with the additional suppression of the dependence on @xmath36 , the formfactors relevant in the @xmath0 system",
    "can then be written as    @xmath37    the cutoff masses @xmath34 together with the coupling constants @xmath33 represent the only parameters in the bonn potential ; they have been adjusted to the @xmath0 data . for the @xmath26 cutoff mass , @xmath38 , the resulting value turned out to be rather large ( @xmath39 ) leading to a mild suppression of opep in the inner region ( @xmath40 ) only , and thus to a hard formfactor .",
    "this is necessary in order to have sufficiently strong tensor force to reproduce the deuteron properties , especially the asymptotic @xmath41- to @xmath18-wave ratio and the quadrupole moment@xcite .    however , there is a long - standing discrepancy between this rather large value required in present - day potential models and information from other sources ; the latter consistently point to a much smaller value for @xmath38 around @xmath42@xcite .",
    "in fact , a recent lattice calculation@xcite of the @xmath43 formfactor confirms this result , finding a monopole mass of @xmath44 .",
    "such a soft formfactor leads to a strong suppression of the ope tensor force already at intermediate distances , in apparent disagreement with the deuteron data .",
    "it is sometimes argued that a reduction ( or even elimination ) of @xmath1 exchange in @xmath0 models would remedy the situation easily since the tensor force of @xmath1 exchange has opposite sign compared to @xmath3-exchange .",
    "this can certainly be done if one looks at the deuteron channel only .",
    "however the sizable strength of @xmath1 exchange is tightly constrained by informations from @xmath45 scattering via dispersion theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in fact required by the precisely measured triplet @xmath19-wave @xmath0 phase shifts ; it therefore can not be arbitrarily changed .",
    "4.5 cm    consequently we have to find mechanisms so far not included in meson exchange @xmath0 models which provide additional ( short ranged ) tensor force .",
    "two years ago it was pointed out by ueda@xcite that the contribution arising from the exchange of a correlated three - pion state between the nucleons , with the quantum numbers of a pion , should enhance the short - range tensor part of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "correlated @xmath31 exchange addressed in the foregoing chapter is a good part of it , and there is obviously no way around this contribution .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the diagram in figure  [ figx ] requires as input a realistic @xmath31 @xmath46-matrix . in the absence of elastic @xmath31 scattering data ( due to the fast decay of the @xmath1 meson into 2 pions ) we have to rely completely on a dynamical model .",
    "3.75 cm    we@xcite have recently constructed a corresponding potential model , in complete analogy to the @xmath30 case ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with driving terms shown in fig .",
    "[ figxi ] .",
    "open parameters are adjusted mainly to empirical information in the @xmath47-channel ( the @xmath47 decaying into @xmath3 and @xmath1 ) , namely the resonance parameters ( pole position ) of the @xmath47-particle@xcite ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) obtained from @xmath50-meson decay , and the mass spectrum obtained from charge exchange production@xcite , @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ figxii ] .",
    "note that the shift of the maximum of the mass spectrum away from the true pole position is due to the sizable non - pole amplitude @xmath52 , obtained by iterating @xmath53 ( the first two diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figxi ] . ) .",
    "this non - pole contribution now acts in all other channels , e.g.  in the pionic channel of interest here , with a definite strength distribution , which is characteristic of the underlying model .",
    "this @xmath31 @xmath46-matrix is now inserted into the correlated @xmath31 exchange diagram of fig .",
    "the evaluation@xcite proceeds via the same dispersion - theoretic treatment as used for the @xmath30 case in ref .",
    "the result can be represented as integral over various spectral functions , the number of which depend on the considered channel . for the pionic channel we have one spectral function @xmath54 : @xmath55    @xmath54",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figxiii ] .",
    "obviously the correlated part provides a sizable contribution , with a peak around @xmath56 , somewhat smaller than the mass ( @xmath57 ) of the phenomenological @xmath58 introduced in some recent @xmath0 models to accommodate a soft @xmath26 formfactor@xcite .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figxiv ] and table 1 , the resulting interaction due to correlated @xmath31 exchange in the pionic channel is able to counterbalance the substantial suppression induced in opep when going from a cutoff mass @xmath38 of @xmath59 , phenomenologically required in the ( full ) bonn potential , to a value of @xmath60 .",
    "further tensor contributions , with the same sign as pion exchange , arise from correlated @xmath31 exchange in the @xmath47-channel .",
    "if these will be included , too , @xmath38 can be decreased further , into the region of @xmath42 .",
    "thus the inclusion of correlated @xmath31 exchange in a meson exchange @xmath0 model should allow to use the correct , soft @xmath26 formfactor , and thus resolve a long - standing puzzle .",
    "in this talk , i have tried to convince you that , in low energy baryon - baryon interactions , chiral symmetry does not appear to be the dominant symmetry : a meson exchange model like the bonn potential , which violates ( to some extent ) chiral symmetry , is able to describe the data quantitatively . on the other hand , a model strictly obeying chiral symmetry but restricting itself to pions as mesonic degrees of freedom and one - loop contributions shows noticeable deficiencies in the description of the empirical situation , already at very low energies . a minimal requirement for",
    "improvement would be the inclusion of two - loop contributions , i.e.  to go to still higher order in the chiral expansion , in order to take at least part of the @xmath6correlation effects ( `` @xmath13 '' and @xmath1 exchange ) into account    anyhow , there are a lot of baryonic processes whose physics is dominated by quite high orders .",
    "for example , we have recently shown@xcite that the @xmath61 reaction goes predominantly through the @xmath62 intermediate state , with strong initial ( @xmath63 ) , intermediate ( @xmath62 ) , and final ( @xmath64 ) state interactions .",
    "each interaction itself has sizable higher order contributions , e.g.  annihilation processes into 2 ( or more ) mesons .",
    "a treatment of these coupled channels effects in the chiral approach , including systematically all diagrams at the required order , is surely beyond our capabilities .    in this area of medium energy physics to be studied with our cosy accelerator , it appears more efficient not to single out the goldstone bosons as relevant degrees of freedom but to include from the beginning higher mass mesons as mediators of baryonic interactions , in this way summing up an important class of higher order correlation effects , as done already for the @xmath7-isobar in ref .",
    "further selected summations of processes to arbitrarily high order , in a potential - type coupled channel framework , have to be performed .",
    "necessarily the full and exact implications of chiral symmetry are then lost .",
    "clearly , as always in physics , the actual treatment of a given theory ( kind of approximations ) depends on the phenomena under study and on the questions addressed .",
    "if , for example , the main issue is to study modifications of hadronic interactions in the medium , chiral symmetry gains much more importance due to chiral restoration in matter .",
    "thus , in order to study such effects seriously , a strictly chiral model is probably required .",
    "still , one should always be aware about what has been ( necessarily ? ) sacrificed and about the consequences .",
