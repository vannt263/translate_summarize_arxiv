    "clusters of galaxies are very sensitive probes to cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "systematic uncertainties in precision cosmology using galaxy clusters can be minimized by restricting the sample of clusters to the highest degree of dynamical relaxation , and hence studying relaxed clusters is particularly important .",
    "in addition , the outer envelopes of clusters have been thought to be less subjected to complicated physics such as active galactic nucleus feedback , and hence these outer regions may provide better cosmological probes .",
    "clusters are believed to be formed by the continual merging and accretion of material from the surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "based on high resolution @xmath2-body simulations , it has been found that cluster growth can be divided into an early fast accretion phase dominated by major mergers , and a late slow phase dominated by smooth accretion of background materials and many minor mergers @xcite .",
    "accretion shocks ( or virial shocks ) are unambiguous predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . for the most relaxed clusters with roughly spherical morphology in the outer regions , these simulations show that large amounts of material are accreted through filamentary structures in some particular directions , and more spherically symmetrically in other directions .",
    "most of the simulations assume the intracluster medium ( icm ) is in collisional equilibrium . however ,",
    "because of the very low density in the cluster outer regions ( @xmath3 is the radius within which the mean total mass density of the cluster is @xmath4 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "the virial radius @xmath5 is defined as a radius within which the cluster is virialized . for the einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath6 , while for the standard @xmath0cdm universe , @xmath7 . ] ) , the coulomb collisional and collisional ionization timescales are comparable to the age of the cluster . it has been pointed out that electrons and ions there may be in non - equipartition @xcite , and also the ionization state may not be in collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "if these non - equilibrium processes are not properly taken into account , the measured properties may be biased in these regions .    studying the outer regions of relaxed clusters not only",
    "is valuable in understanding the accretion physics and to test the assumptions concerning plasma physics near the shock regions , but it is also very important to test structure formation theory and to constrain the systematic uncertainties in clusters to be used as precision cosmological probes . before the launch of the _ suzaku _ x - ray observatory , physical properties such as temperature have never been constrained with confidence beyond roughly one - half of the shock radius . most of our understanding of these regions is still based on theoretical models and hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "recently , observations by _ suzaku _ have constrained temperatures up to about half of the shock radius for a few clusters for the first time to better than a factor of @xmath8 @xcite . while the uncertainties are still large , there is evidence that the electron pressure in cluster outer regions may be lower than that predicted by numerical simulations assuming collisional equilibrium .",
    "observations of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with the south pole telescope ( spt ) and the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ )",
    "7 year data also support these results @xcite .",
    "these observational signatures are consistent with electrons and ions in non - equipartition , although it is also possible that the hydrodynamic simulations may simply overestimate the gas pressure .",
    "another possibility is that heat conduction outside the cluster may be reducing the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that cosmological parameters will be biased if non - equilibrium effects ( in particular , non - equipartition ) are not properly taken into account .",
    "more observations of the outer regions of clusters are being done or analyzed . in the future , the proposed _ international x - ray observatory _ ( @xmath9 ) will have the sensitivity to constrain cluster properties out to the shock radius .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the physics in the outer regions of clusters would be useful .",
    "in particular , _ ixo _ will have sufficient spectral resolution to resolve many important x - ray lines , and hence the ionization state of the plasma can be determined .    in @xcite",
    ", we have studied in detail the x - ray signature of non - equipartition effects in cluster accretion shock regions . in this paper , we extend our study to include non - equilibrium ionization in our calculations .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization calculations have been considered in a number of cosmological simulations to study the very low density warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) surrounding galaxy clusters @xcite . at galaxy",
    "cluster scales , similar non - equilibrium ionization calculations have focused on merging clusters @xcite .",
    "these studies generally agree that in the low density icm and the whim , there are significant deviations from ionization equilibrium , and that the effects on the x - ray emission lines are strong . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the x - ray signatures of non - equilibrium ionization in the accretion shock regions of relaxed clusters .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of non - equilibrium ionization effects with the future _ ixo_.    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ ion_sec : method ] describes in detail the physical models and techniques to calculate non - equilibrium ion fractions and x - ray observables , which includes the hydrodynamic models we used ( section  [ ion_sec : hydro ] ) , and the ionization and spectral calculational techniques ( sections  [ ion_sec : ionfraccal][ion_sec : xraycal ] ) .",

    "this non - radiative condition allows us to calculate the hydrodynamics and then the ionization structure and x - ray emission separately .",
    "the hydrodynamic models simulate the accretion of background material from the surrounding regions onto clusters through accretion shocks in the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the calculated hydrodynamic variables ( e.g. , density and temperature profiles ) in the cluster outer regions are consistent with those calculated by three - dimensional simulations , and a detailed discussion on our hydrodynamic simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations were done using eulerian coordinates . in calculating the time - dependent ionization for the hydrodynamic models , we need to follow the lagrangian history of each fluid element . in",
    "one - dimensional spherical symmetric systems , it is convenient to transform from the eulerian coordinates to the lagrangian coordinates by using the interior gas mass as the independent variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius , and @xmath20 is the gas density . to do this , we first determined the values of @xmath21 for each of the grid zones in the hydrodynamical simulations in @xcite at the final redshift of @xmath22 .",
    "the values of the density and temperature were also determined for this final time step for each gas element .",
    "then , for each earlier time step , the values of gas density and temperature within the shock radius were determined by linear interpolation between the nearest two values of the interior gas mass on the grid at that time . when the values of @xmath21 fall between the discontinuous values of the shocked and preshocked elements , we assume the material to be preshock .",
    "this slightly underestimates the ionization timescale parameter defined below , but this effect is small as the grid zones in the simulations are closely spaced .",
    "the collisional ionization and recombination rates and the excitation of x - ray emission depend on the electron temperature ( @xmath23 ) . because the accretion shock may primarily heat ions instead of electrons due to the mass difference and the long coulomb collisional timescale between electrons and ions , the electron temperature may not be the same as the ion temperature near the accretion shock regions @xcite .",
    "the degree of non - equipartition depends on the non - adiabatic shock electron heating efficiency , which is defined as @xmath24 in @xcite , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the changes in electron temperature and average thermodynamic temperature due to non - adiabatic heating at the shock , respectively .",
    "while there are no observational constraints on @xmath27 in galaxy cluster accretion shocks , observations in supernova remnants suggest that @xmath28 for shocks with mach numbers similar to those in galaxy cluster accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "@xcite have calculated electron temperature profiles for models with a very low electron heating efficiency ( @xmath29 ) , an intermediate electron heating efficiency ( @xmath30 ) , and an equipartition model ( @xmath31 ) .",

    ", we compare the photoionization and collisional ionization rate for the ions we are interested in .",
    "the photoionization rate of an ion @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the photoionization cross section of ion @xmath40 at frequency @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the ionizing flux .",
    "near the cluster accretion shock , the dominant photoionization source is the uv background .",
    "we approximate the uv ionizing flux at @xmath45 as a power law @xmath46 with @xmath47 erg  @xmath48  s@xmath11",
    "hz , @xmath49  hz , and @xmath50 @xcite . for example",
    ", for the and ions we are most interested in throughout this paper , adopting the photoionization cross sections given by @xcite gives @xmath51@xmath52  s@xmath11 and @xmath51@xmath53  s@xmath11 .",
    "the slowest collisional ionization rate of the oxygen ions is of the order of @xmath54 )  s@xmath11 for typical temperatures ( @xmath55  kev ) and densities in the outer regions of clusters @xcite .",
    "this is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the photoionization rates of and ions .",
    "even at @xmath56 when the uv background is roughly 80 times stronger @xcite , the densities in the outer regions of clusters will be higher by a factor of @xmath57 , and hence collisional ionization rates will increase by a similar factor .",

    "the eleven heavy elements c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni are included in our calculations . the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , which are related to the ionization and recombination rates , used to solve equation  ( [ ion_eq : ionization ] )",
    "are taken from the latest version of the _ nei _ version 2 model in xspec ( version 12.6.0 ) . the atomic physics used to calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in xspec",
    "are discussed in @xcite , and the ionization fractions in the latest version of xspec are calculated using the updated dielectronic recombination rates from @xcite .",
    "all of the eleven heavy elements are assumed to be neutral initially when solving equation  ( [ ion_eq : ionization ] ) , which is a good approximation as long as the ionization states of the preshock plasma are much lower than that of the postshock plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have also tested this by assuming all the ionization states in the preshock regions are in collisional ionization equilibrium initially at different temperatures of @xmath67 and @xmath68  k. we confirmed that the final ionization fractions for and are essentially the same .",
    "once the ionization states are calculated by solving equation  ( [ ion_eq : ionization ] ) , the x - ray emission spectrum could be calculated by using available plasma emission codes such as the raymond - smith code @xcite , the spex code @xcite , and the apec code @xcite .",
    "we chose to use a version of the apec code as implemented in the _ nei _ version 2 model in xspec to calculate the x - ray emission spectrum .",
    "the routine uses the astrophysical plasma emission database ( aped ) to calculate the resulting spectrum .",
    "thus , the atomic data we used to calculate the ionization fractions and spectrum are mutually consistent , both coming from the same _ nei _ model version 2.0 in xspec . the publicly available line list _ apec_nei_v11 _ was used throughout the paper .",
    "the inner - shell processes are missing in this _ nei _ version 2 .",

    "we assume the abundance to be a typical value for galaxy clusters , which is 0.3 of solar for all models , and use the solar abundance tables of @xcite .",
    "we calculated the x - ray emissivity in photons per unit time per unit volume per unit energy , @xmath70 , for each fluid element in our hydrodynamic models at redshift zero , which can be expressed in terms of an emissivity function , @xmath71 , by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the proton density . the emissivity function",
    "@xmath71 depends on the ionization fractions and the electron temperature , but is independent of the gas density .",

    "the ionization state of the gas depends on @xmath89 and the collisional ionization and recombination rates . for an under - ionized plasma ,",
    "the collisional ionization rates are more important , so that the ionization state should depend mainly on @xmath91 . for an under - ionized plasma where the electron temperature is greater than the ionization potential of the relevant ions",

    "however , the projected and line emission will be significantly affected even at a radius as small as one - fourth of the shock radius .",

    "the right panels of figure  [ ion_fig : sb ] show that in addition to the non - equilibrium ionization effect , non - equipartition will increase the soft emission by a significant factor near the shock radius .",
    "this occurs because in the cie  non - eq and nei models , the electron temperatures in the outer regions are lower than for the cie  eq model , and",
