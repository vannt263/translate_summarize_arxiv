    "last year , the direct evidence for neutrino oscillation @xcite was found in three kinds of experiments , namely atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite , reactor neutrino experiment @xcite and k2k experiment @xcite . in these experiments , the dip of neutrino oscillation and the energy dependence of the probability , were observed .",
    "the possibilities of neutrino decay @xcite and neutrino decoherence @xcite are excluded by these results and it is found that the only solution for the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problem is neutrino oscillation .",
    "the observation of the dip also means that the neutrino experiments herald in a new era of precise measurements , because the effect , which disappears by averaging out the time - varying part on the neutrino energy , has been observed in these experiments for the first time @xcite .",
    "solar neutrino parameters have been also accurately determined by recent neutrino experiments such as sno and kamland @xcite .    from the results of the past experiments , it was found that the solar neutrino deficit is explained by the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw @xcite solution @xcite , @xmath4 where the mass squared difference is defined by @xmath5 .",
    "it was obtained that @xmath6 from the atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the upper bound of the 1 - 3 mixing angle , @xmath1 is given by @xmath7 from the reactor experiment @xcite . the next step for neutrino physics is the determination of @xmath8 , the sign of @xmath9 and cp phase @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the measurement of the leptonic cp phase is one of the most important themes from the viewpoint of the origin of the universe .",
    "cp violation has been investigated also in quark sector for the first time and the kobayashi - maskawa theory has been established @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found that the cp violation in quark sector is too small to generate the sufficient baryon number in the universe @xcite , because the electroweak symmetry breaking is not the first phase transition as the higgs particle is too heavy .",
    "this means that the origin of baryon asymmetry of the universe is not a cp violation from the km phase and an extra source of cp violation is needed .",
    "one of the alternatives is the generation of a baryon number due to the leptonic cp violation @xcite .",
    "the possibility of this scenario has been investigated by many researchers @xcite .    in order to attain the next step ,",
    "the long baseline experiments like superbeam experiments @xcite and neutrino factory experiments @xcite are planned . in these experiments ,",
    "the earth matter effects disturb the observation of the cp violation because the matter in the earth is not cp invariant and generate the effects of fake cp violation .",
    "therefore , it is very important to understand the earth matter effects in neutrino oscillation experiments .    here , summarizing the results of the atmospheric , solar and reactor neutrino experiments , there are two small parameters @xmath11 the magnitude of these small parameters is most important for measuring the cp violation , because it can not be observed , if one of these parameters vanishes .",
    "as the lma msw solution was chosen to explain the results of the solar neutrino experiments , @xmath12 reduced to the largest value compared to other solutions .",
    "this means that the lma msw solution opens the door for measuring the leptonic cp violation .",
    "if @xmath13 is too small , it will be impossible to observe the cp violation .",
    "therefore the magnitude of @xmath13 controls whether the leptonic cp violation can be observed or not .",
    "let us briefly review the approximate formulas using the small parameter @xmath12 or @xmath13 and the related papers . at first using the perturbation of oscillation probability in @xmath12 ,",
    "the magnitude of the fake cp violation by the matter effects has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by expanding the matter potential to the fourier mode , it has been shown in @xcite that the mode with large wavelength mainly contributes to the oscillation probability .",
    "higher order perturbative calculations have been performed by @xcite .",
    "the perturbation in @xmath13 has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the perturbation in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 has also been studied in @xcite and this method has been extended to all channels in @xcite .",
    "next let us review the remarkable features related to the leptonic cp violation . in the case of constant matter density , the notable identity @xmath14 has been found in @xcite , where @xmath15 is the jarlskog factor related to the leptonic cp violation",
    ", @xmath16 means @xmath17 and tilde stands for the quantities in matter .",
    "in addition , it has been pointed out that the oscillation probability in matter almost coincide with that in vacuum under the certain condition , which is called vacuum mimicking phenomena , and the method to solve the problem on the fake cp violation by using the phenomena is discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be applied to the future long baseline experiments by using the statistical method explained by @xcite .    in a previous series of papers",
    "@xcite we have considered the three generation neutrino oscillation in matter and have shown that the cp dependence of the oscillation probabilities are derived exactly @xcite . in the case",
    "that @xmath18 is included in the initial or final state , the cp dependence is given by @xmath19 and in the case that both the initial and final state are @xmath20 , the cp dependence is given by @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 are independent of the cp phase .",
    "we have also shown that these coefficients can be calculated exactly in constant matter and then the approximate formulas are derived in a simple way @xcite . furthermore",
    ", we proposed a new method for approximating these coefficients in the case of non - constant matter density @xcite , and then applied it to the earth matter @xcite .    in this paper , at first within the framework of two generations , it has been shown that perturbation of the small mixing angle is not effective near the msw resonance point .",
    "this means that the non - perturbative effects by the small mixing angle is important in the msw resonance region .",
    "next , we consider non - perturbative effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the three generation neutrino oscillation .",
    "the importance of the non - perturbative effects is shown by comparing the exact numerical calculation with the perturbative expansion of the small parameters .",
    "furthermore , we consider the method for deriving the approximate formulas in which the non - perturbative effects are taken into account . in our previous paper @xcite , the approximate formulas for @xmath23 have been derived .",
    "these formulas are effective for both msw resonance regions .",
    "however , there is a problem because this method can not be extended to other channels @xmath24 and so on . in order to solve this problem",
    ", we assume the two natural conditions , @xmath3 and the symmetric matter potential . under these conditions ,",
    "we derive the approximate formulas for all channels , including non - perturbative effects of the two small parameters .",
    "these formulas are useful to solve the problem of parameter degeneracy.-",
    "in this section , we discuss the perturbative expansion of a small mixing angle in two generation neutrino oscillation . although we discussed the perturbation of small parameters in our previous papers @xcite , in order to clarify the physical meaning , we consider the perturbation due to a small mixing angle within the framework of two generations . then , we show that the perturbation breaks down in the msw resonance region even if the mixing angle is small .      in this subsection , we consider the two generation neutrino oscillation and we choose the energy region and the baseline length in which the msw resonance occurs .",
    "let us start from the hamiltonian in constant matter @xmath25 where the matter potential is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the fermi constant and @xmath28 is the electron density in matter .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 is mixing matrix as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the quantities with tilde stand for the quantities in matter . diagonalizing",
    "( [ 2-generation ] ) to ( [ diagonal ] ) , the effective masses @xmath32 and effective mixing angle @xmath33 are determined .",
    "if we use the notation @xmath34 as the mass squared difference , there is a relation between the mass squared difference and the mixing angles as @xmath35 using these quantities in matter , the oscillation probability is given by @xmath36 the oscillating part with @xmath37 of this probability becomes large if the condition @xmath38 is satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition for the maximal effective mixing angle is given by @xmath39 in the case of small mixing angle , this condition is rewritten as @xmath40 , and furthermore we define the resonance energy by @xmath41 we also define the resonance length by @xmath42 for the case of @xmath43 , which is the upper bound in the chooz experiment , the resonance length is roughly estimated as 10000 km .",
    "this means that in near future it is impossible to realize the long baseline experiments such that the baseline length from beam source to the detector is nearly equal to the resonance length .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that matter effects exist even if the baseline length is shorter than the resonance length .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath44 km as the baseline length in the later sections .",
    "next , let us consider the expansion of the effective mass @xmath45 and the effective mixing angle @xmath46 by a small mixing angle @xmath47 . we show that although the effective mass and the effective mixing angle diverge in the msw resonance energy region , the oscillation probability , which is a function of these two quantities , converges .",
    "at first , the effective mass is expanded as @xmath48 one can see from this result that other terms than the first term diverge . the higher order term",
    "have larger divergence near the msw resonance .",
    "the effective mixing angle is expanded as @xmath49 the condition @xmath50 is needed for @xmath46 to converge the finite value . however , this condition can not be satisfied in the msw resonance region defined by @xmath51 , even if @xmath47 is small .",
    "this means that the above perturbation series diverges . in the expansion for the effective mass and the effective mixing angle , the coefficients become large , even if these quantities are expanded by the small mixing angle .",
    "next , let us consider the oscillation probability and let us demonstrate that the oscillation probability reaches a finite value , where the divergences due to the effective mass and the effective mixing angle are canceled out by each other . substituting ( [ expansion - mass ] ) and ( [ expansion - mixing ] ) into ( [ probability ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 + \\cdots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit , @xmath53 , it is found that the oscillation probability becomes finite as @xmath54 from this equation , the oscillation probability becomes finite and the perturbation is a good approximation if    @xmath55    as you see from ( [ r - length ] ) , this is the condition that the baseline length is shorter than the resonance length .",
    "next , let us investigate the magnitude of non - perturbative effects numerically .",
    "we use the following parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we set the baseline length , @xmath58 and the energy region , @xmath59 , to include the msw resonance energy .",
    "furthermore we choose a density of @xmath60 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we compare the probabilities calculated by our approximate formulas in all channels with those by the second order formulas in addition to numerical calculation in figure 4 .",
    "one can see the following points from this figure .",
    "the second order formulas show large differences from the numerical values around 5 gev , where the high energy msw resonance occurs .",
    "in other energy regions they are in good coincidence . the value of @xmath61 has the largest difference , the probabilities @xmath23 and @xmath62 have the next largest difference , the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 have also significantly large difference , but only the probability @xmath24 has a small difference .",
    "in addition , these figures show that the difference between the second order formulas and the numerical calculation exists even in the two applicable regions ( [ energy - condition ] ) and ( [ baseline - condition ] ) .",
    "although we do not show a figure , the difference between our approximate formulas ( [ p_em2])-([c_mt-2b ] ) and the second order formulas ( [ double - p_em])-([double - c_mt ] ) become more clear out of the two applicable regions ( [ energy - condition ] ) and ( [ baseline - condition ] ) .",
    "the reason is that our approximate formulas ( [ p_em2])-([c_mt-2b ] ) are applicable even for the case that the condition ( [ energy - condition ] ) or ( [ baseline - condition ] ) for energy and baseline length does not hold , as confirmed from the comparison with the exact numerical calculation .",
    "however , the second order formulas are good approximations , when the neutrino energy is not near the resonance energy , even if the baseline length is long .",
    "in this section , we investigate the reason for the difference between the second order formula , which contains the approximation with double expansion up to the second order of two small parameters , and the numerical calculation around the msw resonance region as explained in the previous subsection .",
    "we discuss the non - perturbative effects of small mixing angle more detailed than in section 2 .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate how the second order formulas are approximated expanding on @xmath65 in the previous paper , we have discussed the probability @xmath23 , so we calculate the second order formula for @xmath24 here .",
    "the method of calculation is basically the same but the calculation itself becomes slightly complex , because we need to calculate the effective mass and the effective mixing angle up to the second order of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the case of @xmath24 . in this point , the calculation is not straightforward compared with that of @xmath23 but the method of approximation is the same .",
    "note that @xmath66 in ( [ c_mt-1 ] ) does not include the effective mixing angle .",
    "for this reason , it is sufficient to expand the effective mixing angle up to the zeroth order , but we need to expand the effective mass up to the second order to calculate the probability up to the second order in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the effective mixing angle is expanded up to the zeroth order as @xmath67 and the effective mass is expanded up to the second order as @xmath68 here , we should emphasize the following points . eqs .",
    "( [ mixing-12 ] ) and ( [ mass-12 ] ) obtained by the expansion in @xmath12 diverge in the vacuum limit @xmath69 and eqs .",
    "( [ mixing-13 ] ) and ( [ mass-13 ] ) obtained by the expansion in @xmath13 diverge in the high energy msw resonance limit @xmath70 . as shown in the following ,",
    "these divergences cancel and the probability has a finite value . expanding @xmath66 in ( [ c_mt-1 ] ) up to the second order , we obtain @xmath71 we also expand @xmath72 in ( [ c_mt-2a ] ) and @xmath73 in ( [ c_mt-2b ] ) as @xmath74 finally , we obtain ( [ double - c_mt ] ) arranging these result order by order .    here",
    ", let us consider the applicable region of the second order formulas .",
    "@xmath75 diverges in the limit @xmath69 and @xmath76 diverges in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath72 also diverges in the limit @xmath78 and @xmath73 diverges in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "the divergences in @xmath69 and in @xmath77 come from the expansion of the effective masses ( [ mass-12 ] ) and ( [ mass-13 ] ) respectively .",
    "it seems that the second order formulas do not reduce to those in vacuum due to the divergence in @xmath69 and furthermore do not reduce to those in the high energy msw resonance point due to the divergence in @xmath70 .",
    "however , when we consider the pair @xmath79,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the divergence in @xmath69 cancel and the value converges .",
    "the obtained finite value is given by @xmath80 before we expand , @xmath66 and @xmath81 have finite values in the limit @xmath69 and @xmath77",
    ". however , the divergence appears in expansion of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the cancellation of these divergences occurs between @xmath75 and @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the cancellation occurs between the different terms and result in finite values , respectively , at first , which is an interesting result .",

    "the finite value is given by @xmath83.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cancellation of these divergences occurs between the different terms @xmath76 and @xmath73 , which is also a remarkable result .",
    "we have shown that the second order formulas have finite values in the limit @xmath69 and @xmath77 , but it is not always the same as that in the numerical calculation .",
    "actually , the difference in fig . 4 in the limit @xmath77 ,",
    "shows that the second order formulas have finite values but they are not in accordance with those in the numerical calculation . in order to study this , we compare the three quantities , the numerical calculation , our formulas and the second order formulas .",
    "we can learn the differences mainly in the vacuum limit @xmath69 and the high energy msw resonance limit @xmath70 from the comparison .    at first , let us consider the vacuum limit @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the discussion , we consider the case of @xmath84 .",
    "the second order formulas in the limits @xmath69 and @xmath84 are given by @xmath85 next , taking the limit @xmath69 and @xmath84 in our formulas , we obtain @xmath86 expanding the oscillating part of ( [ our - c_mt - low ] ) in our formula , it leads to ( [ double - c_mt - low ] ) obtained from the second order formula .",
    "the condition for the expansion on the oscillating part for sufficiently good approximation is @xmath87    next , let us consider the high energy msw resonance limit @xmath70 . in order to simplify the discussion , we take the high energy msw resonance limit @xmath70 under the condition @xmath88 . in the high energy msw resonance limit of the second order formula ,",

    "the condition for the expansion of the oscillating part for a sufficient approximation is given by @xmath92 if the baseline length is shorter than that obtained from above condition , the second order formula becomes a good approximation .",
    "we obtain the following results about the perturbative expansion on the small parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    1 .",
    "the perturbative expansion in @xmath12 actually corresponds to the expansion in @xmath93 .",
    "this constrains the applicable energy for the approximate formulas .",
    "if we expand in the parameter @xmath93 , the effective mass @xmath94 and the effective mixing angle @xmath95 diverge in the vacuum limit @xmath69 .",
    "however , these divergences cancel out each other in the calculation of the oscillation probability .",
    "thus , the probability has a finite value , but the value largely differs from the numerical calculation in low - energy .",
    "the magnitude of this difference becomes large and serious in the case of small mixing angles and in low - energy long baseline experiments .",
    "2 .   if we expand in the small mixing angle @xmath13 , the effective mass @xmath96 and the effective mixing angle @xmath97 diverge in the msw resonance energy limit @xmath70 .",
    "however , these divergences also cancel each other out in the calculation of the oscillation probability .",
    "thus , the probability has a finite value , but the value largely differs from the numerical calculation in the high - energy msw resonance region .",
    "this means that the second order formulas can not be used in the high energy msw resonance region .    in two generations",
    ", we can calculate the oscillation probabilities exactly by solving the second order equation .",
    "so , we do not need the perturbative expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of the approximate formulas applicable to arbitrary matter density profile is very difficult in three generations .",
    "therefore , we need to expand on the small parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .      we have shown that the double expansion formulas up to the second order in the two small parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 does not give a good approximation in the msw resonance region .",
    "this is because the coefficients of the small parameters have large values in the msw resonance region . in this subsection ,",
    "let us discuss some methods proposed up to present to solve this problem .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath98 is written by four parameters .",
    "the two parameters @xmath99 control the physics mainly in the low - energy region and the other two parameters @xmath100 control the physics mainly in the high - energy region .",
    "in other words , the magnitude of @xmath12 determines low - energy phenomena and the magnitude of @xmath13 determines high - energy phenomena .",
    "both of these parameters are very small but the energy region , where the expansion converges , is different .",
    "this means that we need to treat the applicable energy region carefully when we expand on these two parameters .",
    "there are several methods in order to take into account the higher order terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for example    1 .",
    "exact formulas in constant matter density profile 2 .",
    "reduction formulas taking into account the two generation part exactly    in the first method , there does not exist any error generated from the perturbative expansion , because of the exact treatment of both @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . furthermore , non - perturbative effects can be easily investigated by using these exact formulas .",
    "the second method was introduced in our previous paper @xcite . in this method",
    ", we try to include the higher order terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 partially , except for the terms including the product of two small parameters .",
    "this method includes the higher order terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 and is simply and applicable even in the case of arbitrary matter density profile @xcite .",
    "although this method uses only the second order approximation of the amplitude , it has the notable feature that the third order ( three generation ) effects such as cp violation can be calculated .",
    "in this paper , we consider the method how to approximates the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter under three generations and the obtained results are summarized as following .    1 .   in the framework of two generation neutrino oscillation , we discuss the applicable region of the perturbative expansion on the small mixing angle in matter .",
    "the result of the perturbation differs largely from the exact numerical calculation in the msw resonance point .",
    "this means that non - perturbative effects are important even for the neutrino oscillation in two generations .",
    "2 .   we extend the method @xcite to calculate the approximate formulas , in which non - perturbative effects of the small parameters @xmath0 and @xmath101 , to all channels . under the conditions , @xmath3 and the symmetric matter density profile , we derive simple approximate formulas of the probabilities in all channels by using the unitary relation .",
    "although all these approximate formulas are expressed by the amplitudes calculated within the framework of two generations , it has a notable feature that the three generation effects such as cp violation can also be calculated .",
    "3 .   in the three generation neutrino oscillation with matter",
    ", we investigate non - perturbative effects of the two small parameters @xmath0 and @xmath101 .",
    "we compare our approximate formulas with those from the double expansion , which include the terms up to the second order in the low and high energy msw resonance regions .",
    "the obtained result is that the second order formulas show large differences from the exact numerical calculation , which means that non - perturbative effects of the small @xmath0 and @xmath1 become important in the msw resonance region .    finally , we describe two problems that we could not fully address in this paper , and which are tasks for future research .    1 .",
    "the approximate formulas in this paper are derived by using the condition @xmath3 , which is the center value obtained from the atmospheric neutrino experiments . however , but differences from this value may exist within 90% confidence level .",
    "the condition for the symmetric matter density is satisfied in the 1-dimensional models , like the prem and the ak135f , but the actual matter density , for example , that from j - parc to beijing is not symmetric @xcite .",
    "therefore , our aim for future work is , to derive more sophisticated approximate formulas that hold not only in symmetric matter but in arbitrary matter as well .    to solve the above two problems are the future works this",
    "is now included in the upper sentence .",
    "we are grateful to h. yokomakura , and t. yoshikawa for useful discussions and careful reading of our manuscript .",
    "we would like to thank prof . wilfried wunderlich ( nagoya inst .",
    "technology ) for helpful comments and advice on english expressions .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the coefficients of the probabilities in detail .",
    "we show that the 2 - 3 mixing angle and the cp phase are not affected by matter , from a different point of view as described in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "this result means that we only have to consider the matter effects on four parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 . by using this result",
    ", we can understand the matter effects in three generations , which become complex compared with that in two generations .      in this subsection",
    ", we show that @xmath104 do not affect the effective mass in three generation hamiltonian .",
    "if we express the effective hamiltonian in matter as @xmath105 the equation of eigenvalue is given by @xmath106 and by solving this equation , we obtain the effective masses as @xmath107 @xcite , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are defined by @xmath110 \\\\ c & = & a\\delta_{21}\\delta_{31 } |u_{e1}|^2 \\\\ s & = & \\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{3}\\arccos\\left ( \\frac{2a^3 - 9ab+27c}{2\\sqrt{(a^2 - 3b)^3}}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these effective masses depend only on the following three vacuum mixing angles @xmath111 one can see from these equalities that the effective masses are independent of the 2 - 3 mixing angle @xmath112 and the cp phase @xmath10 .",

    "we separate @xmath112 and @xmath10 from the hamiltonian and we study the dependence of the amplitudes on the two small parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the standard parametrization is defined by @xmath113 where the cp phase matrix @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 the cp phase matrix @xmath114 and the 1 - 2 mixing matrix @xmath116 are commutable as @xmath117 = [ \\gamma,{\\rm diag}(0,\\delta_{21},\\delta_{31 } ) ] = 0.\\ ] ] therefore , the hamiltonian can be separated as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is defined by @xmath120 this means that the 2 - 3 mixing and the cp phase can be separated from the part which includes the matter effects @xmath121 .    in the case of constant matter density profile",
    ", we obtain @xmath122 the 2 - 3 mixing angle and the cp phase do not affect the eigenvalue equation .",
