    "i.e. , in @xmath129 , if we again increase @xmath31 , then the existence region of npsws decreases whereas the existence region of ppsws bounded by the curves @xmath93 and @xmath97 increases . for @xmath115",
    ", the system does not support negative potential solitary structures anymore but it supports ppdl and @xmath99 ( see figure [ fig_sol_spc_wrt_beta](e ) ) . again , in this interval of @xmath31 , the existence region of ppsws bounded by the curves @xmath93 and @xmath97 decreases for increasing @xmath31 and as a result , the existence region of the positive potential solitons after the formation of double layer decreases and finally , disappears from the system for @xmath130 .",

    ", we have considered the supersoliton structures that occur beyond double layers with the help of qualitatively different existence domains .",
    "now , we explain their different unusual shapes with the help of phase portraits of the system of coupled equations ( [ phase_portraits ] ) in the @xmath134 plane .    to describe the existence and the unusual shape of ppsss , we consider figure [ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001 ] - figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_0017 ] and figure [ saddle_points ] , where we have used the existence domain as shown in figure [ fig_sol_spc_wrt_mu](f ) to determine the mach numbers for the formation of ppsss . to draw the phase portraits of the coexistence of solitons of both polarities as shown in figure [ pp1_coexistence ] , we have used the existence domain with respect to @xmath32 for @xmath135 , @xmath104 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 to determine the mach numbers for the coexistence of solitons of both polarities .    in figure",
    "[ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001 ] - figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_0017 ] and in figure [ pp1_coexistence ] , @xmath138 is plotted against @xmath10 in the upper panel ( or marked as ( a ) ) of each figure .",
    "the lower panel ( or marked as ( b ) ) of each figure shows the phase portrait of the system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) . in these figures ,",
    "we have used the values of the parameters as indicated in the figures with @xmath139 .",
    "the curve @xmath138 and the phase portrait have been drawn on the same horizontal axis @xmath140 .",
    "the small solid circle corresponds to a saddle point whereas the small solid star indicates an equilibrium point other than saddle point of the system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) .",
    "it is simple to check that each maximum ( minimum ) point of @xmath138 corresponds to a saddle point ( an equilibrium point other than a saddle point ) of the system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) .",
    "from these figures , we see that there is a one - one correspondence between the separatrix of the phase portrait as shown with a heavy blue line in the lower panel with the curve @xmath138 against @xmath10 of the upper panel .",
    "again , it is important to note that the origin @xmath141 is always a saddle point of the system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) and the separatrix corresponding to a solitary structure appears to start and end at the saddle point ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the separatrix corresponding to a solitary structure is shown with a heavy blue line whereas other separatrices ( if exist ) are shown by green lines .",
    "the closed curve about an equilibrium point ( other than a saddle point ) contained in at least one separatrix indicates the possibility of the periodic wave solution about that fixed point .",
    "for example , the closed curves ( red lines ) of figure [ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001](b ) about the fixed point ( 0.54,0 ) lying within the separatrix indicate the possibility of the periodic wave solutions about the fixed point ( 0.54,0 ) .",
    "figure [ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001](a ) shows the existence of a ppsw before the formation of ppdl and figure [ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001](b ) shows that the corresponding phase portrait contains only one saddle at the origin and a non - zero equilibrium point .",
    "consequently , there exists only one separatrix that appears to start and end at the origin enclosing a non - saddle fixed point .",
    "more precisely , the trajectory corresponding to the separatrix approaches the origin as @xmath142 .",
    "it is also important to note that a separatrix corresponding to a solitary structure does not correspond to a periodic solution because for this case , the trajectory takes forever trying to reach a saddle point .",
    "in fact , this is the reason that a pseudo - particle associated with the energy integral ( [ energy_integral ] ) takes an infinite long time to move away from its unstable position of equilibrium and then it continues its motion until @xmath10 takes the value @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 and again it takes an infinite long time to come back its unstable position of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "similarly , figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_004 ] confirms the existence of a ppsw after the formation of ppdl .    from the phase portraits as given in figure [ pp1_soliton_epsilon=0_pt_001](b ) and figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_004](b )",
    ", we see that there is no qualitative difference between these two phase portraits . again , according to dubinov & kolotkov @xcite , the separatrix corresponding to a supersoliton envelopes one or several inner separatrices and several equilibrium points .",
    "so , according to dubinov & kolotkov @xcite , figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_004](b ) does not correspond to a supersoliton .",
    "but figure [ phi_vs_xi_supersoliton ] shows that there is a finite jump between the amplitudes of solitons before and after the formation of double layer .",
    "to explain this fact , we first of all consider the phase portrait corresponding to a double layer solution as given in figure [ pp1_ppdl](b ) .",
    "although figure [ pp1_ppdl](a ) shows that the curve @xmath138 crosses the @xmath10-axis at the point @xmath146 ( approximately ) but if we enlarge the figure [ pp1_ppdl](a ) in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath146 then we see that @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "consequently , we have a double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy_integral ] ) with @xmath150 and @xmath151 are two saddle points of the dynamical system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) .",
    "figure [ pp1_ppdl](b ) shows that the separatrix corresponding to the double layer solution appears to pass through two saddle points and it encloses another two equilibrium points .",
    "if both the saddle points exist after a small increment of @xmath47 from @xmath97 then the separatrix appears to pass through the origin encloses an inner sparatrix through a non - zero saddle and at least two equilibrium points as shown in the lower panel of figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_0017 ] .",
    "therefore , according to the definition of supersoliton ( dubinov and kolotkov @xcite ) , we see that for the same set of values of the parameters , @xmath152 defines a supersoliton whereas @xmath153 does not define a supersoliton .",
    "but in both the cases we have a finite jump between the amplitudes of solitons after and before the formation of double layer .",
    "to make a clear difference between the solitary structures given in figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_004](b ) and the lower panel of figure [ pp1_supersoliton_epsilon=0_pt_0017 ] for @xmath153 and @xmath152 respectively , we consider figure [ saddle_points ] . in this figure",
    ", we draw the saddle and other equilibrium points of the system ( [ phase_portraits ] ) on the @xmath140-axis for increasing values of @xmath47 starting from @xmath154 .",
    "this figure shows that for increasing values of @xmath47 the distance between the non - zero saddle and the non - saddle fixed point nearest to the origin decreases and ultimately both of them disappear from the system .",
    "finally , the system contains only one saddle at the origin and a non - zero equilibrium point .",
    "consequently , only one separatrix enclosing the non - saddle fixed point is possible that appears to pass through the saddle at the origin .",
    "so , the existence of a soliton after the formation of a double layer confirms the existence of a sequence of supersolitons and there exists a critical value @xmath155 of the mach number @xmath47 such that for the existence of supersolitons after the formation of a double layer we must have @xmath156 whereas for @xmath157 , we get soliton like structures after the formation of a double layer . thus , figure [ saddle_points ] clearly shows the transition between soliton and supersoliton structures after the formation of a double layer .",
    "but it is important to note that there is always a finite jump between the amplitudes of solitons before and after the formation of double layer .    from the lower panel of figure [ pp1_coexistence ]",
    ", we see that there are two separatrices .",
    "the separatrix as shown by a heavy blue line corresponds the coexistence of solitons of both polarities and this separatrix is contained in another separatrix as shown with a green line .",
    "there exist infinitely many closed curves between these two separatrices and each of these closed curves corresponds to a super - nonlinear periodic wave as shown in figure 5(c ) and figure 6(c ) in the paper of dubinov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a dusty plasma system . however , further investigation of the super - nonlinear periodic wave solutions of the energy integral ( [ energy_integral ] ) is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in the present work , we have carried out a systematic investigation on the nature of existence of different dia solitary structures in an unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains , adiabatic warm ions , cairns distributed nonthermal electrons and positrons with the help of existence domains and phase portraits .",
