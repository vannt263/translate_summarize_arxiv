    "on september 15 , 2001 , @xcite reported the discovery of an apparent supernova ( sn ) in the galaxy ugc 11794 , also mistakenly called ngc  7112 ( ra : 21h42m22.9s dec : 12d29m54s ; z=0.019493 j2000.0 ) . throughout the paper we use h@xmath9 = 70  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , and @xmath10 @xcite , for which the measured redshift corresponds to a proper distance of @xmath11mpc and an angular distance of @xmath12mpc .",
    "early spectral line data suggested it was of type i b / c ( more likely ic ) @xcite .",
    "it was detected in the radio about @xmath13 years after the explosion @xcite , initially displaying a rising flux together with an optically thin spectral slope @xmath14 ( @xmath15ghz ) .",
    "it also showed a high x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 at 0.5@xmath168@xmath4kev @xcite .",
    "this made it a good candidate for harboring a bipolar relativistic jet pointing away from our line of sight @xcite , which has by then decelerated to mildly relativistic velocities .",
    "such late time radio emission is expected in some type ib / c sne that may be associated with gamma - ray bursts @xcite or alternatively produce only mildly relativistic bipolar outflows , and could naturally produce a rising radio flux in the optically thin regime @xcite , as the jets interact with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) and are decelerated .",
    "later observations , about @xmath1 years after the explosion @xcite , showed broad h@xmath2 ( fwhm 40  = 1800  km s@xmath5 ) lines that are not typical of type ib / c sn .",
    "observations using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) were proposed to resolve the source or detect proper motion if it is powered by decelerating relativistic jets @xcite . however , despite several attempts with various instruments the source has not been resolved @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation was suggested by @xcite , who developed a model in which regular newtonian ejecta from the supernova explosion collides with a dense , massive circumstellar shell ( cs ) .",
    "in addition to previously published vlbi observations , we add the most recent high sensitivity array ( hsa ) observation from february 2007 ( about 5.4 years after the explosion ) . in order to provide the most accurate measurements and a conclusive picture for the proper motion , as well as the expansion velocity of sn 2001em",
    ", we use our observation in combination with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed sn 2001em with the hsa , which consists of nrao s very long baseline array ( vlba ) , the phased very large array ( vla ) , the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) , the arecibo radio telescope ( ar ) , and the effelsberg radio telescope ( eb ) .",
    "the observation was conducted on february 5th , 2007 with a total time of 10 hours at 8.4 ghz ( bandwidth 32 mhz , total recording bit rate 256 mbit s@xmath5 ) .",
    "vlbi data was correlated with the nrao vlba processor at socorro .",
    "analysis was done with nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and caltech s difmap for modeling .",
    "in addition we also used the vla ( in a configuration ) observation on february 18th 2007 , which observed the continuum of sn 2001em in l , c and k - band over a total time of about an hour .",
    "the three previous vlba / hsa observations from july 2004 @xcite , november 2004 @xcite and may 2006 @xcite were re - reduced in a consistent fashion .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table  [ tab : observation ] including important parameters of these observations .",
    "the data was corrected for ionospheric delay , faraday rotation , and parallactic angle as well as for earth s orientation .",
    "we used fringe fitting to calibrate the data for group delay and phase rate .",
    "the three datasets from previous vlbi observations have been treated equally , to ensure comparable results .",
    "our vlbi observation of sn 2001em was phase - referenced to jvas j2145 + 1115 ( 1.4@xmath17 away ) and j2139 + 1423",
    "( 2.1@xmath17 away ) .",
    "the switching intervals were @xmath18180 s for j2145 + 1115 , @xmath1893 s for sn  2001em , and @xmath1839 s for j2139 + 1423 , which was observed in addition about every 5th cycle .",
    "we used j2145 + 1423 to check our phase reference ( j2145 + 1115 ) to get a measure for the quality of our phase referencing as well as a position fixed to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) .",
    "in addition we used j2139 + 1423 to check astrometry and over results for possible motion within j2145 + 1115 .",
    "we obtained the results for absolute position , thus for proper motion , by fitting the fully calibrated and phase - referenced ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) plane data , of the observations from 4 epochs , to a circular gaussian model .",
    "this is a good fit for a point source , as we did not see any resolved extended emission .",
    "however , the first vlbi observation from july 2004 does not use j2139 + 1423 as phase reference check as described above , instead it uses j2139 + 1316 which is 1.0@xmath17 away from our pointing center .",
    "furthermore only the vlba was used in this initial observation .",
    "we plot the position including errorbars in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn2001em - pos ] .",
    "we find a circle with a radius of 0.170  mas that encompasses all the observed positions .",
    "this suggests that sn  2001em shows little or no proper motion .    to get an estimate for the error of the proper motion , we plotted the positions of j2139 + 1423 phase referenced to j2145 + 1115 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j2139 + 14-pos ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2136 + 141 ] , which shows according to our data a proper motion of 0.45 mas year@xmath5 in the northwest direction . @xcite give a relative motion of the 4 components between 0.108 and 0.593 mas year@xmath5 separated up to 3.5 mas from the core .",
    "this can be explained by changes in the extended emission of j2139 + 1423 , which shows an extremely curved jet @xcite , in combination with any proper motion of the phase check calibrator .",
    "the intrinsic motion of j2139 + 1423 has been determined to be @xmath21 40 @xmath22as year@xmath5 .",
    "we also assume our reference source j2145 + 1115 to be stationary . using a linear relationship between the stationary phase center and the apparently moving j2139 + 1423 , that are 3.49@xmath17",
    "apart from each other , we find an error for the proper motion of sn 2001em of @xmath230.184 mas year@xmath5 .",
    "this high error is not very satisfactory and yielded unreasonably small @xmath24 values . as shown by ,",
    "the linear approach is not reliable .",
    "thus we had to find a better way to obtain a reasonable error for the positions .",
    "using the discussion of astrometric accuracies of vlba observations by and the @xmath24 value of the weighted least squares fit , we were able to reduce the position errors to 0.013 mas and 0.051 mas in r.a . and",
    "dec . respectively",
    "using a weighted least squares fit for the motion in r.a . and",
    "dec . separately",
    "[ fig : wlsq ] ) , we get an error of 0.037 mas year@xmath5 in r.a . and 0.071 mas year@xmath5 in dec .",
    "we obtained a proper motion of ( 0.030 @xmath23 0.037 ) mas year@xmath5 in r.a . and",
    "( @xmath160.053 @xmath23 0.071 )  mas  year@xmath5 in dec . , which gives a total proper motion of @xmath25 the proper distance to sn 2001em is 83.14 mpc , then the proper motion gives us a projected velocity on the sky of @xmath26 @xcite report a proper motion , based on two epochs , of ( 0.089 @xmath23 0.093 )  mas  year@xmath5 or ( 33,000 @xmath23 34,000 )  km  s@xmath5 , respectively , where for the cosmological parameters we use the latter becomes ( 35,000 @xmath23 37,000 )  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "again we used the fully calibrated and phase - referenced to j2145 + 1115/j2139 + 1423 ( @xmath19,@xmath20 )  plane data , to image the sn using difmap .",
    "[ fig : image ] shows the vlbi image of sn 2001em on 2007 , february 5 . the source is not resolved .",
    "the resolution of our observation was ( 2.02 @xmath27 0.858 ) mas at @xmath28 .",
    "a precise determination of the upper limit for the size of sn 2001em was obtained using monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we again used model fitting in the ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) plane with a circular gaussian model .",
    "we created 100 ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) datasets for a range of sizes for each epoch based on flux density and corresponding image rms noise using aips task uvmod .",
    "this creates simulated datasets with similar properties to the actual data .",
    "we found the minimum @xmath24 for each simulated dataset and examined the gaussian distribution of modelfit sizes depending on the simulated source diameter defined in uvmod .",
    "this has been done for all 4 epochs and a range of simulated source sizes .",
    "the combined results of the upper limits for size ( fwhm diameter of the circular gaussian ) with a confidence of 95% are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "this means that 95% of the gaussian distribution is below the upper size limit thus giving us a 2@xmath6 upper limit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizelimit ] we show a plot of the upper limit radii vs. time and the linear fit to obtain an upper limit for the expansion velocity . assuming this linear expansion behavior since its discovery on 2001.704 , we find a 2@xmath6 upper limit for the expansion velocity of 0.015  mas  year@xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath29 @xcite report a 2@xmath6 upper limit for the average expansion velocity since the explosion of 25,800  km  s@xmath5 , at 4.6 years after the sn .",
    "for that same epoch , when reanalyzing the same data we obtain a 2@xmath6 upper limit of 8,100  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we used a circular gaussian model for model fitting instead of an elliptical one which already reduces the size limit by a factor of about @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we fit directly to the visibility data and used the monte carlo simulation method which in the case of an unresolved source improves results further compared with image plane fitting the elliptical gaussian using the aips task jmfit .",
    "many multifrequency observations of sn  2001em have been conducted with the vla since 2003 .",
    "we present the published values and the observations from february 2007 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8ghz - lc ] we show the 8.46  ghz detections plotted over time since the supernova explosion . from the peak brightness the 8.46  ghz peak luminosity is ( 1.54 @xmath23 0.10)@xmath30 erg s@xmath5 hz@xmath5 .",
    "we see a power law decay in the flux densities since its peak around 2004 ( or @xmath8yr since the sn ) with an index of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "[ fig : feb07-spec ] shows the spectrum at the time of our observations ( @xmath33 ) where our measurements are at 1.46  ghz , 4.9  ghz , 8.4  ghz and 22  ghz , the values are listed in table  [ tab : datafeb7 ] .",
    "the 22  ghz point is a 5@xmath6 detection . the spectral index ( @xmath34 ) at the cut - off between 8.4  ghz and 22  ghz is @xmath35 and between 4.9 and 8.4  ghz it is @xmath36 .",
    "the lack of any apparent proper motion is consistent with other vlbi measurements of sne .",
    "some of these other vlbi monitored sne include sne  1986j ( iin ) , 1987a ( ii peculiar ) , 1993j ( iib ) , 2001gd ( iib ) , and 2004et ( iip ) @xcite . with a fourth epoch ,",
    "we have further constrained the value reported to ( 24,000@xmath2332,000 )  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "while such constraints on the proper motion may sometimes indicate a symmetric blast - wave centered on the supernova position , in our case the 2@xmath6 upper limit on the average proper velocity ( 87,000 km s@xmath37 ) is much larger than that on the average expansion velocity ( 6000 km s@xmath5 ) , and therefore no proper motion is expected to be detected even for a reasonably asymmetric supernova ( i.e. given the limit on the expansion velocity , we would expect to detect proper motion only for an extremely asymmetric explosion , which has not yet been observed in ordinary supernovae ) .",
    "the constraint on the proper motion does , however , rule out a relativistic jet pointing away from us @xcite as the source of the radio ( and x - ray ) emission .",
    "in such a scenario , the current limit on the size of the emitting region allows only for a very compact emission region , and rules out a double sided jet where both sides are visible ( even if the emission from each side is from a compact region ) .",
    "moreover , the limit on the proper motion also rules out the possibility that only one side of the jet is visible , since for a compact relativistic emission region moving at an angle @xmath38 relative to our line of sight , the observed limit on the apparent velocity @xmath39 implies , e.g. , @xmath40rad for @xmath41 .",
    "such a small angle relative to our line of sight would not produce an optically thin rising flux @xmath42 years after the sn ( since by that time the lorentz factor is no more than a few and our line of sight would be well within the beaming cone of the radio emission ) , which was the original motivation for suggesting such an explanation .    comparing results for sn  2001em to sn / grb pairs 1998bw , 2003lw and 2006aj ,",
    "peak luminosities at first suggest a possible grb event of sn  2001em , but its peak late in time does not match the pattern of sn / grb pairs @xcite .",
    "in addition grb sn show much larger expansion velocities , @xmath43100,000 km s@xmath5 , than what we obtained @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results rule out even a mildly relativistic outflow with an energy comparable to that of the sn ejecta ( which is @xmath44erg ) , which would not be capable of producing a grb , and may potentially be much more common in core collapse sne compared to highly relativistic outflows of similar energy @xcite .",
    "our 1@xmath6 limiting value for the velocity of the radio - emitting region of a blastwave of @xmath453,000  km  s@xmath5 is unusually low ( see table  [ tab : velocities ] ) and is close to the lowest measured velocity of the radio emitting region of any sn , reported for sn  1987a by @xcite of @xmath453,500  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite report a minimum , measured expansion velocity of ( 15,700 @xmath23 2,000 )  km  s@xmath5 for the radio emitting region of the type iip sn  2004et .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit for the expansion velocity for the radio emitting region of the type iib sn  2001gd of 23,000  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite report an evolving velocity for the radio - emitting region with the outer velocity of the radio emitting shell to be @xmath18  10,000  km  s@xmath5 and the inner velocity to be @xmath18  7,000  km  s@xmath5 occurring between days 1063 and 1399 since explosion .",
    "the only other type iin sn with a measured velocity of its radio emitting region was sn  1986j , @xcite report an average expansion velocity that dropped from 7,500  km  s@xmath5 in 1988 to 6,300  km  s@xmath5 in 1999 .",
    "what is of particular interest is that sn  2001em , originally classified as s type ic sn , has such a low average expansion velocity .",
    "@xcite estimate that the radio emitting region s expansion velocity if similar to the type ic sn  2003l , should exceed 16,000  km  s@xmath5 and likely be as high as 30,000  km s@xmath5 . assuming the early optical classification of @xcite to be valid , we might expect the blastwave of sn  2001em to have been resolved near the limit we establish had it undergone a period of rapid expansion prior to hitting a very dense csm .",
    "preliminary models of vla observations suggest an average mass - loss of @xmath46  m@xmath47  year@xmath5 , assuming wind - driven , clumpy / filamentary csm @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicates that such a radio - derived mass - loss rate is slightly higher than values determined for other type iin sne , 1.14@xmath48  m@xmath47  year@xmath5 for sn  1988z and 4.28@xmath49  m@xmath47  year@xmath5 for sn  1986j .",
    "however , depending on when this shell of material was ejected , the actual mass - loss event was likely much higher than this average value .",
    "due to a lack of any radio observations within the first two years following the explosion , we are unable to place any reasonable upper - bound on this mass - loss rate .",
    "we obtained a 2@xmath6 upper size limit of the radio emitting region of @xmath50 cm after 5.4 years , which is marginally consistent with the model of @xcite , in which the ejecta collides with a dense circumstellar shell at a radius of @xmath51 cm after @xmath52yr ( note that a thin emitting shell , that is more relevant for their model , gives an upper limit on the radius and average expansion velocity that is smaller by @xmath53 compared to the circular gaussian that we have used ) .",
    "our results support the picture that at a very early epoch , this supernova has evolved from a type ib / c sn with little circumstellar interaction to a type iin with strong circumstellar interaction .",
    "the classification as type iin sn was in part due to the late - time observation of a narrow h@xmath2 line @xcite .",
    "this detection indicates the existence of cool shocked circumstellar gas @xcite .",
    "the large x - ray luminosity of @xmath54 at @xmath55days implies a radiated energy in the x - ray range ( @xmath56@xmath57kev ) of the order of @xmath58erg ( assuming the typical time for variation in @xmath59 is @xmath60 ) .",
    "this sets a strict lower limit on the energy that was dissipated and converted into internal energy by that time , of @xmath61erg .",
    "however , the true value of @xmath62 is most likely significantly higher than this lower limit , due to the combination of various inefficiencies in the conversion of the dissipated energy into radiation in the x - ray range within the dynamical time .",
    "first , the total radiated energy is probably somewhat larger than the measured value , since @xmath63 is still rising within the observed energy range ( @xmath64 ; * ? ? ? * ) and should therefore peak at higher energies .",
    "second , not all of the dissipated energy is given to the electrons , and most of it can go into protons ( or other ions ; both the thermal population or cosmic rays ) or magnetic fields , and thus would not be radiated away .",
    "finally , even the energy that does go into electrons is not always radiated away efficiently on the dynamical time .",
    "given all the above , we consider @xmath65erg to be a more realistic estimate of the energy that has been dissipated by time @xmath66 ( although a somewhat lower value might still be possible under some circumstances ) .",
    "this would suggest a deceleration time of @xmath67days , i.e. that by that time the ejecta had interacted with a surrounding mass comparable to its own mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the radio light curve also suggests a deceleration time of @xmath68days , while our limits on the source size imply that the typical initial velocity @xmath69 of the mass that has decelerated by @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",
    "for an external density @xmath72 this implies @xmath73 that corresponds to a mass - loss rate of @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the stellar wind velocity of the progenitor star , assuming a quasi steady wind during the relevant time scale .",
    "such a high mass loss rate may suggest an episodic mass ejection event , rather than a steady wind , that would result in a dense csm shell .",
    "the required mass of such a csm shell is at least comparable to that of the sn ejecta that was decelerated until @xmath70 , @xmath76 .",
    "now , let us consider the opacity of this part of the original sn ejecta , of mass @xmath77 and initial velocity @xmath69 , at earlier times .",
    "assuming one free electron per proton mass , its thompson optical depth at @xmath78 would be @xmath79 , while additional opacity from other parts of the ejecta could only add to the total optical depth .",
    "this opacity is somewhat large for the time near the peak of the supernova optical light curve ( @xmath80days ) , and may become a more severe problem if @xmath69 turns out to be lower than the current upper limit on it .",
    "it is clear that sn  2001em exhibits radio properties consistent with a type ii sn with a significant csm / blastwave interaction .",
    "future vlbi monitoring is recommended .",
    "as the blastwave expands we will be able to further constrain or eventually determine the average velocity of the blastwave .",
    "sn  2001em has faded considerably at 8  ghz over the last few years but is still readily detectable with a estimated flux density at the end of 2008 of 0.55 mjy . with",
    "hsa recording rates expected to increase to 4096 mbps by 2011 , the thermal noise level of the hsa at 8 ghz should decrease to @xmath181.40 @xmath22jy beam@xmath5 at an integration time of 8 hours , thus keeping pace with the fading of sn 2001em which is expected to follow a power law decay . at the end of",
    "2008 an hsa observation ( 512 mbit s@xmath5 ) would have a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 139 and by 2011 with 4096 mbit s@xmath5 bandwidth a snr of 288 based on 1@xmath6 using natural weighting .",
