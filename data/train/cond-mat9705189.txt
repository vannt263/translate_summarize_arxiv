    "the dynamics of magnetization switching in nanometer - sized particles of highly anisotropic ferromagnets is interesting , from both the scientific and technological points of view .",
    "the basic scientist sees in such particles a laboratory to study the decay of a metastable phase towards equilibrium , while the technologist sees a promising material for ultrahigh - density magnetic recording media .",
    "although ferromagnetic nanoparticles have been studied experimentally for a long time @xcite , until recently this was only possible with powders . however , with modern techniques of nanofabrication @xcite and ultrahigh - resolution methods to detect the magnetization , such as magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) @xcite lorentz microscopy @xcite and micro - squid devices @xcite , one can now synthesize and study such particles individually .",
    "the most common description of magnetization switching is a mean - field approach , originally due to nel @xcite and brown @xcite . to avoid an energy barrier due to exchange interactions of strength @xmath0 , uniform rotation of all the atomic moments in the particle",
    "is assumed .",
    "the remaining energy barrier , @xmath1 , is caused by magnetic anisotropy , which is a combination of crystal - field and magnetostatic effects .",
    "the equilibrium thickness of a wall between oppositely magnetized domains is @xmath2 . for particles smaller than @xmath3 ,",
    "the uniform - rotation picture is reasonable .",
    "if the anisotropy is largely magnetostatic , the resulting demagnetizing field causes particles larger than @xmath3 to form oppositely magnetized domains , and switching is achieved through the field - driven motion of preexisting domain walls .",
    "however , if the anisotropy is largely due to the local crystalline environment , there exists a window of particle sizes that are larger than @xmath3 but smaller than the size at which the particle becomes multidomain .",
    "[ this is for instance often the case in ultrathin films . ]",
    "such particles can be modeled as ising systems with local spin variables , @xmath4 .",
    "depending on the degree of anisotropy , these spins can either represent the @xmath5 component of individual atomic moments , or one can coarse grain the system by rescaling all lengths in terms of @xmath3 , so that the @xmath6 represent block spins .",
    "the ising hamiltonian is @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the ferromagnetic exchange interaction , @xmath9 is the applied magnetic field times the local magnetic moment , and the sums @xmath10 and @xmath11 run over all nearest - neighbor pairs and all sites on a suitable lattice , respectively . here",
    "we only report numerical results for two - dimensional square lattices , but our theoretical arguments are valid for general spatial dimension .",
    "the order parameter is the dimensionless magnetization , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total number of ising spins in the particle .    in the highly anisotropic nanoscale ferromagnets described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) [ and modifications discussed below ] , the state of uniform magnetization opposite to the applied field is properly viewed as a",
    "_ metastable phase_. this nonequilibrium phase decays by neither uniform rotation nor by the motion of preexisting domain walls , but rather by the thermal nucleation and subsequent growth of _ localized droplets _ ,",
    "inside which the magnetization is parallel with the field @xcite .",
    "this decay mechanism yields results very similar to effects observed in recent experiments on well - characterized single - domain ferromagnets in the nanometer range . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a maximum in the switching field ( or coercivity ) vs.  particle size @xcite .",
    "another quantity which is often measured in experiments , is the probability that the particle has _ not _ switched within a specified waiting time @xcite .",
    "results concerning this quantity can be found in refs .",

    "the ising model does not have an intrinsic dynamic . to simulate the effects of thermal fluctuations",

    "the magnetization inside the droplet is parallel with the applied field and has a magnitude near the temperature dependent zero - field magnetization , @xmath17 , which is nonzero below the critical temperature , @xmath18 .",
