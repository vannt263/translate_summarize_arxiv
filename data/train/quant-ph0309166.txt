    "the notion of `` measurement '' as an interruption of deterministic evolution governed by the schrdinger equation has proven to be accurate and convenient in describing experiments ; particularly so in the framework of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "however , it has remained unclear why measuring devices should not themselves be governed deterministically by the interacting hamiltonian of their constituents . since the 1920s ,",
    "a peculiar role for an observer s consciousness has been suspected by many authors , based on von neumann s observation @xcite that the `` collapse of the wavefunction '' can be deferred indefinitely by successive measurements , terminating only when an observer gets aware of the result .",
    "a partial solution of the measurement problem has been accomplished by taking into account the environment - induced decoherence @xcite of macroscopic systems . in this approach , a `` pointer '' basis in the hilbert space of an observing system",
    "is identified which is stable under perturbations by the system s environment .",
    "when the system evolves according to the schrdinger equation , coupling to an object to be observed , a density matrix emerges which is diagonal in the pointer basis .",
    "this amounts to a classical statistical ensemble emerging from a quantum state .",
    "however , decoherence alone does not provide a mechanism by which the environment would determine a particular result of the measurement @xcite .",
    "in fact , such a mechanism is faced with a no - go theorem @xcite which contends that no linear evolution exists which would evolve an arbitrary state of superposition , @xmath0 , into a state characterized by property @xmath1 or property @xmath2 . the fundamental assumption made in proving",
    "the theorem is that the final ( measured ) states are orthogonal , or nearly so at least .",
    "that latter assumption , however , may not apply to quantum brain states of _ conscious observers_. brain states fundamental to an interpretation of quantum physics have been considered already by a number of authors , such as donald @xcite , beck and eccles @xcite , stapp @xcite , and mould @xcite .",
    "all of those authors assume an independent ( non - schrdinger ) stochastic agent to determine the result of a `` measurement '' , thus adopting the point of view of open quantum systems .",
    "hence , there has not yet been an occasion to discuss the mentioned no - go theorem in the context of brain states . in the present paper , by contrast , a schrdinger equation ( linear and deterministic ) of a hypothetical mechanism is specified by which microstates of neuronal heat baths would determine a collective perception of @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( as above ) by all observers engaged .",
    "as has been stressed already by donald @xcite , the recent progress of the neurosciences @xcite should encourage discussing brain states in terms of basic neurophysical notions , such as the firing and resting of neurons . the clear distinction of firing and resting states ( all - or - nothing principle ) can be traced back to molecular origins @xcite .",
    "it involves the opening of ion pores , and subsequent passage of millions of ions through the neuronal membrane .",
    "ion pores are protein molecules which exist in `` closed '' and `` open '' states .",
    "even the opening of a single pore can trigger macroscopic nerval activity @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of the present article is that the opening of a pore molecule is a configurational tunnel process , parameterized by some molecular mass , barrier height and width .",
    "the barrier is assumed to be thermalized at brain temperature .",
    "aiming at just a proof - of - existence of linear and deterministic mechanisms of `` measurement '' , the potential curve is assumed to be of rectangular shape , with only the thickness vibrating thermally .",
    "if that basic notion of the firing and resting of neurons is `` quantized '' so as to make schrdinger s equation applicable , it would seem inevitable to consider an observer s neurons in a state of superposition , @xmath3 where the resting component may be physically large but is _ not _ , almost tautologically , _ part of an observer s experience_. information about the result of",
    "a measurement would reside in the firing component , so that final states of observers may have considerable overlap in their resting component .",
    "quantum states of neurons should , in principle , be amenable to experimental tests , although a number of decohering effects @xcite would have to be overcome .",
    "if the molecular tunneling were stationary , it would show an extreme dependency on parameters . such a sensitivity does not generally carry over to time - dependent potentials , as exemplified by periodic time - dependency @xcite , or by quantum shutters @xcite in which the height of a rectangular potential barrier is suddenly reduced from @xmath4 to a finite value . in the model considered here ,",
    "the exponential sensitivity is found to persist if the _ width _ of the barrier is suddenly reduced to a value modulated by a phonon field operator .",
    "this here follows by analysis of an integral equation ; however , the effect has been known as _ vibrationally assisted tunneling _ since the 1980s when it was derived for more general potentials by various approximations @xcite . when typical molecular parameters are inserted , exponential factors @xmath5 with vibrational elongations",
    "@xmath6 in the range of 1   and @xmath7 in the range of 30/  are easily obtained @xcite . in the present application ,",
    "the sensitivity shows up in pseudo - random spikes of tunnel amplitudes , caused by thermal vibrations encoded in the ( nonstationary ) quantum state of a heat bath .",
    "nearly all of the tunneling is comprised in a narrow interval of time , and the sizes of spikes vary over many orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , in a state where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are entangled with neuron @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , the numerical coefficient in one summand will ( almost ) vanish relative to the other , the `` choice '' being determined by the microstates of heat baths @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "with mean value @xmath12 .",
    "the initial wave function @xmath13 of the molecular configuration is of the form @xmath14 with @xmath7 in the range of 30/.[dynbarr],height=207 ]    consider a configuration of effective mass @xmath15 tunneling under a potential step with a right edge in quantized thermal vibrations ( figure [ dynbarr ] ) so that the barrier width is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a `` phonon '' field operator ( details specified in ( [ phiop ] ) below ) taken at some `` trigger '' point of the pore molecule .",
    "parameters on the left side of the potential are not important for the argument .",
    "let us assume the step potential extends to @xmath18 at times @xmath19 ( no tunneling possible ) . to emulate a stimulus to the neuron at @xmath20",
    ", we assume for @xmath21 the hamiltonian to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the configurational position and momentum .",
    "the free hamiltonian of the phonons is @xmath25 for @xmath26 the configuration and the phonons are uncorrelated , and the configurational wave function @xmath27 in the domain of interest , @xmath28 , is an eigenfunction of @xmath29 .",
    "assuming an energy level close to zero , we thus have at @xmath20 @xmath30 @xmath31 is a normalization factor .",

    "if we measure the size of the integrand by the norm in hilbert space , we can omit phase factors as well as the unitary operator @xmath39 , obtaining @xmath40 the norm squared involves an integral over the configurational coordinate , yielding @xmath41 the time - dependence of the tunnel matrix element is thus determined by the free evolution of the phonon field operator in the ( non - stationary ) phononic quantum state @xmath42 .",
    "the heat bath is modeled as a microcanonical phononic ensemble with initial conditions set by temporary contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath43 . as a workable example of a non - stationary state",
    "we assume the phonon field to be initially in a coherent state .",
    "we consider an @xmath44 membrane of atoms of mass @xmath45 , assuming harmonical coupling , periodic boundary conditions , and linear dispersion for simplicity .",
    "the elongation of an atom at site @xmath46 is given in the interaction picture by @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 are phonon annihilation and creation operators satisfying canonical commutation relations .",
    "the coherent state is represented as @xmath51 by standard procedures , the matrix element in expression ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) is found to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 the first factor of ( [ expphi ] ) is time - independent , while the second factor carries the time dependence induced by the non - stationary state of the heat bath . since @xmath55 is the mean phonon number in the @xmath56 mode of the coherent state , the microcanonical ensemble is approximated here by choosing the @xmath57 at random with a statistical weight @xmath58 at an assumed temperature of 310k .    to illustrate the orders of magnitude involved in a range of parameters as they occur in brains ,",
    "let us assume a configurational mass of 6amu ( reduced mass of two carbon atoms ) and a barrier height like the potential difference across a neuronal membrane , @xmath59 .",
    "the decay constant of the wave function ( [ psi0 ] ) then is @xmath60 as to the fluctuations of the barrier width , let us equate them with thermal vibrations of a water particle ( 18amu ) in an aqueous membrane with lattice spacing 3 , speed of sound @xmath61 , and debye frequency @xmath62 .",

    "the lattice size turns out to be an insensitive parameter as to the qualitative appearance of the figure ; it was chosen here to be @xmath65 . ]",
    "the numerics of figure [ thermfluc ] is quite suggestive as to features of a full solution of ( [ inteq ] ) .",
    "clearly , the peak of the integrand occurs at a time @xmath66 when the edge of the barrier is at a position @xmath67 of maximal elongation to the left - hand side ( see figure [ dynbarr ] ) . the wave packet formed under the integral at this instant of time , @xmath68 ,",
    "is located entirely to the right of the barrier .",
    "subsequently , the edge of the barrier must retract to a less extreme position .",
    "if it would do so in uniform motion , galilean symmetry would equate this to a wave packet impinging from the right on a stationary barrier , and being reflected there .",
    "hence , we expect the wave packet to be _ expelled _ from the retracting barrier",
    ". this should be the effect of the operator @xmath69 under the integral of ( [ inteq ] ) .",
    "since , with parameters as in figure [ thermfluc ] , there are no comparable contributions to the integral from @xmath70 we conclude that the norm of the integrand as given by ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) and ( [ expphi ] ) already provides a complete picture of the tunneling process .",
    "the main implication of formula ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) is that tunneling with a large effective mass , when modulated by thermal vibrations , can be strongly dependent on the thermal fluctuation that happens to occur .",
    "this can produce a conscious `` bit '' from a physical `` qubit '' .      consider a superposition of @xmath71 and @xmath72 of some quantum object , and a `` measurement '' of this state by two neurons , each of which is immersed in its own thermal environment .",
    "the outcome of `` left '' or `` right '' in the measurement would correspond to the firing of one of the neurons .",
    "let us restrict to the case of equal amplitudes for `` left '' and `` right '' since more general superpositions can be reduced to this @xcite .",
    "assuming the initial states of the neurons to be copies of ( [ psiin ] ) we initially have @xmath73 where @xmath74 following standard theory @xcite we assume that , during the measurement , the l - component of the superposition will have the left neuron evolving nontrivially ( its barrier width being finite ) and the right neuron trivially ( its barrier width being infinite ) . in the r - component , the roles of the neurons are interchanged .",
    "thus ( [ initlr ] ) evolves into @xmath75 finally , let us assume that the firing of a neuron requires the configuration to move towards @xmath76 . in a time evolution governed by @xmath77 the potential barrier always extends to @xmath76 , so the configuration will never get there .",
    "hence , in the l - component of ( [ entangledlr ] ) it can only be the left neuron that fires , and in the r - component it can only be the right neuron .",
    "the tunnel amplitudes of the individual neurons , i.e.  the sizes of the summands in ( [ entangledlr ] ) , are determined by the one - neuron hamiltonian considered above  and by the initial conditions of two _ independent _ heat baths .",
    "the spikes of the tunnel amplitudes as illustrated in figure [ thermfluc ] will thus not only occur at different times for the individiual neurons , but also with largely different sizes within the duration of the measurement .",
    "therefore , one of the summands will largely dominate over the other , suggesting that a _ selection _ of `` left '' or `` right '' is being experienced . to illustrate this feature ,",

    "[ 4samples],title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=151 ]      in order to obtain analytical estimates , let us approximate the local phononic elongation @xmath6 ( which is a superposition of many harmonic oscillations ) by a normal distribution with variance @xmath78 and zero mean .",
    "the distribution function of the maxima of @xmath6 then approaches the gumbel form @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ( large ) number of drawings from the normal distribution , and where @xmath81 is a somewhat involved expression comparable in size to @xmath82 .",
    "let us put @xmath83 .    for a `` decision '' between left and right , the peak in one channel must be sufficiently large in comparison to the peak in the other .",
    "let `` sufficient '' imply a ratio of amplitudes of @xmath84 , at least .",
    "thus we wish to know the probability for @xmath85 in one drawing from the gumbel distribution to differ by @xmath86 , at least , from @xmath85 in the other drawing . in terms of @xmath85 in the first drawing",
    ", that probability is @xmath87 similarly , we may consider a more general superposition with unequal coefficients , @xmath88 , and ask for the probability that the amplitude of the first term be the larger one .",
    "this implies @xmath89 so that the probability is @xmath90 since , in favour of a clear `` decision '' , @xmath91 should be a large number , the probability depends rather weakly on the ratio of the amplitudes .",
    "this is a potential problem , as discussed in section [ problems ] .",
    "if conscious results of an observation are determined by the vibrations of a neuron s heat bath  how can several observers of an object systematically agree on their results ?    for the question to make sense , all observers must be conscious  a neuron must be firing in each observer . if there are @xmath92 observers , each with neurons l and r , the initial state of the object - observer system can be written in the same form as equation ( [ initlr ] ) , where now @xmath93 with @xmath94 the quantum state of the thermal environment of the left or right neuron of observer @xmath95 .",
    "time evolution proceeds as in expression ( [ entangledlr ] ) where now @xmath96 each evolution operator @xmath97 has an integral representation ( [ inteq ] ) of which the interactive part produces a conscious state .",
    "hence , objectivity is to be located in the part of hilbert space generated by @xmath98 where indices l and r refer to the respective summand in superposition ( [ entangledlr ] ) . due to the product structure of expression ( [ obsprod ] ) there is no physical meaning any more for individual amplitudes of neuronal firing ",
    "all factors multiply into a collective effect .    as in section [ sizeofintegrand ]",
    "we look for strong peaks in the norm of the integrand for which we obtain a product of expressions of the form ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) , @xmath99 evaluating this as in ( [ expphi ] ) we obtain , in particular , the time - dependent factor @xmath100 with @xmath101 given by ( [ phiclass ] ) in terms of the fluctuation parameters @xmath102 of the @xmath95th heat bath . the dominating contribution to the integral is obtained from the extrema of the @xmath101 .",
    "these extremal values are themselves ( pseudo-)random variables , each with a probability distribution characterizing a single - observer decision . since a _ sum _ of them occurs in the exponent of ( [ expsumphi ] ) we conclude by the central limit theorem that the fluctuations in the exponent will roughly increase by a factor of @xmath103 relative to single observers .",
    "thus , the accidental dominance of one channel over the other will be even more sharply pronounced than with a single observer .",
    "if observers `` live '' entirely in the tunneling tails of their neuronal wave functions , there is probably nothing in their immediate self - experience that would enable them to discern whether those tails are big or small .",
    "however , with a decay constant of the wavefunction as in equation ( [ kappanumerical ] ) the prefactor @xmath104 in expressions ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) or ( [ expphi ] ) would be irritatingly small unless the mean barrier width @xmath12 is taking values below 1 .    in the scenario considered",
    ", @xmath12 is a free parameter .",
    "the only _ theoretical _ constraint is that thermal vibrations must never ( within the opening time of the neuron s `` shutter '' ) render the dynamical thickness @xmath105 negative .",
    "figure [ thermfluc ] shows that this constraint , too , would put @xmath12 in the range of intra - molecular distances .",
    "moreover , if the neuron s stimulated state were kept for sufficently long , it would necessarily happen at some instant of time that thermal fluctuations render @xmath105 formally negative , indicating an occasional absence of any tunnel barrier at all .",
    "the duration @xmath106 of such a peak will be determined by the inverse debye frequency . with ( [ normsquared(t ) ] ) reducing in such an extreme case to the factor @xmath107 of order unity , the order of magnitude of the integral in ( [ inteq ] ) can be estimated as @xmath108 where the previous values of @xmath59 and @xmath62 have been inserted .",
    "the firing component of the neuronal wave function would thus become comparable in size to the resting component .",
    "the scenario considered only refers to a single act of `` measurement '' .",
    "it is not clear how an entire * conscious history * would emerge . since the `` resting '' part of the neuronal wavefunction carries no memory of the observation , that part would have to `` die out '' somehow .",
    "the problem may be related to ( and possibly solved by ) the fact that actual consciousness ( in humans and animals ) is a much more complicated phenomenon than what has been supposed in this paper . according to edelman @xcite perceptions even of `` primary consciousness '' ( as it is presumed to exist in animals ) are fundamentally dependent on previous ( remembered ) perceptions .",
    "if it were generally true that the present firing of a consciousness - related neuron _ requires _ the firing of similar neurons in the past , then the subspace of present firing would be contained in the subspace of past firing , thus constituting the physical correlate of a conscious history .    for a unique peak of tunneling to emerge from thermal fluctuations as in figure [ thermfluc ]",
    ", the configurational wave function parameter @xmath7 must not be much smaller than the value assumed in equation ( [ kappanumerical ] ) .",
    "obviously , * details of pore molecules * and of their interaction with the neuronal membrane would have to be considered in order to see how realistic the numbers are which were chosen here from the right ball park , at best .",
    "moreover , effects of a * dynamical height * of the barrier would have to be included .",
    "the exponential sensitivity of the tunnel amplitude was demonstrated for a barrier of * rectangular shape*. while there certainly exist many other deformations of the barrier which would lead to the same effect , all of those would be subject to the rather special constraint that their deviation from the initial ( @xmath20 ) shape must be small enough to overcome the exponential growth of @xmath13 towards negative coordinates ( figure [ dynbarr ] ) .",
    "it is reassuring to note that a sensitivity similar to ( [ expphi ] ) arises from completely different arguments in other models of vibrationally assisted tunneling @xcite .    in figures",
    "[ thermfluc ] and [ 4samples ] the simulation extended over about @xmath109 cycles at debye frequency , or about a nanosecond , which is very short in comparison to the tens of milliseconds for which a neuron keeps its state of stimulation . to extrapolate the * peak statistics * to an interval of 10ms ,",
    "let us use again the approximation of section [ gumbelapprox ] ; in particular , equation ( [ gumbel ] ) . thus , if @xmath80 is increased from about @xmath109 to about @xmath110 , the width of the fluctuations of the maxima _ reduces _ by a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "the narrowing trend with increasing @xmath80 is uncomfortable since the fluctuations of the peaks of @xmath6 are at the core of the above mechanism of selection .",
    "anharmonic couplings of phonons would lead to different statistics of peaks and might be essential here .",
    "any quantum - mechanical model of measurement should reproduce * born s rule * for the probability of a particular result .",
    "it is not clear how this rule emerges from the model considered here .",
    "a number of authors have shown , by various kinds of argument , that born s rule is not an independent postulate of quantum mechanics but is dictated by the superposition principle already @xcite .",
    "in particular , deutsch @xcite and zurek @xcite have demonstrated that born s rule for a general superposition of states follows from the special case of an equal - amplitude superposition in which the rule reduces to a symmetry postulate . in case of equal amplitudes ,",
    "the mechanism considered here is in accord with born s rule ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ problr ] ) ) .",
    "what remains to be clarified , not only in the present context but also generally in @xcite and @xcite , is by what physical process the unitary transformation of an arbitrary quantum state into an equivalent equal - amplitude superposition should be accomplished .",
    "a quantum system has been studied which , although governed by a schrdinger equation without stochastic or nonlinear modifications , is able to produce a conscious selection of `` left '' or `` right '' from a superposition of both . the key assumption was that individual neurons of observers always are in `` cat states '' , i.e.  superpositions of firing and resting , with only the firing component being part of an observer s experience .",
    "the model is deterministic , but has the pseudo - randomness encoded in the microstates of heat baths .",
    "the findings would seem to partially corroborate and partially modify the many - worlds interpretation due to everett @xcite . in section [ objectivity ? ] it turned out that collective selections involving many conscious observers are the most robust ; thus , indeed , it seems to be an entire `` world '' that is being selected .",
    "but there does not seem to be a need for a `` branching '' of worlds  the model shows how always one world should be singled out physically . in many - worlds terminology , there is only one `` big '' conscious world while any alternative conscious worlds are very `` small '' ."
