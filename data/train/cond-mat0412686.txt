    "the tendency to formation of inhomogeneous charge and spin states and to phase separation is of fundamental importance for the physics of manganites and other systems with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it is now a common belief that the nature of the colossal magnetoresistance effect is closely related to phase separation phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the most widely discussed type of phase separation is the formation of small magnetic droplets ( magnetic polarons or ferrons ) as a result of the self - trapping of charge carriers in an insulating antiferromagnetic matrix .",
    "this type of phase separation , first discussed by nagaev in his analysis of electron states in magnetic semiconductors  @xcite , is now actively used for interpretation of experimental data on manganites at different doping levels  @xcite .    in this connection ,",
    "a problem arises , whether these self - trapped electron states can survive above the characteristic temperature of the magnetic ordering .",
    "the possible existence of the ferromagnetic correlated regions at the paramagnetic background , `` temperature ferrons '' , was first discussed in detail by krivoglaz  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , there are a lot of experimental indications ( coming mostly from the susceptibility and esr data ) that manganites in the paramagnetic state are rather inhomogeneous .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the high - temperature transport properties of manganites based on the assumption of the existence of ferromagnetically correlated regions in the paramagnetic phase gives a viable picture of the inhomogeneous state  @xcite .    in our paper",
    ", we study the evolution with temperature of a magnetic polaron state over a wide temperature range using a simple model such as an antiferromagnetic chain doped by donor impurities . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", this model reveals the possible existence of different kinds of ferrons  @xcite and seems to capture the essential features of the electronic phase separation in manganites at low doping levels . at low doping ,",
    "the impurity potential is a relevant parameter and we start from the state corresponding to ferrons bound by impurities .",
    "the density of impurities is assumed to be small , so that ferrons do not overlap , and the system as a whole remains insulating .",
    "we demonstrate that ferrons are rather stable objects and ferromagnetic correlations persist at temperatures much higher than the nel temperature of the host chain .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we formulate our model for the antiferromagnetic chain doped by donor impurities . in section  [ sec3 ] , two different methods to calculate the partition function for such a chain , using an approximate variational method and a monte carlo simulation , are presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] , we discuss the characteristic features of the model in different temperature ranges .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional chain of antiferromagnetically coupled local spins .",
    "non - magnetic donor impurities are distributed homogeneously with a period @xmath4 ( in lattice constant units ) along the chain .",
    "the system is described by the double - exchange hamiltonian ,    @xmath5    @xmath6    in eqs .",

    "( [ eq:1a ] ) is the antiferromagnetic exchange between local spins .",
    "the two terms in @xmath13 describe the kinetic energy of conduction electrons bounded by impurities , which are located between sites with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is an integer ) , and the hunds - rule coupling between the conduction electrons and the local spins .",
    "@xmath17 is the electrostatic interaction between an impurity and conduction electron .",
    "parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath2 , and @xmath20 of hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1a ] ) are considered to be positive .",
    "the hierarchy of this parameters is @xmath21 , as usual in the double exchange approximation .",
    "as we pointed out in introduction , the electron - impurity interaction term is needed to describe the low - doping limit of the model , when the material is insulating . in our previous discussions on this model  @xcite ,",
    "this potential was chosen as a deep square well .",
    "although this is a good approximation for @xmath22 , here we prefer to use a more realistic form for this interaction , namely the coulomb potential .",
    "this allows us to find self - consistently the wave function , and hence the size of ferron , which becomes temperature - dependent .",
    "in fact , the calculations show that results are not strongly affected by the specific form of the impurity potential .",
    "we consider the low - doping limit of the model , which corresponds to large @xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to neglect the interaction between electrons corresponding to different impurities , and also to restrict our calculation to a finite portion of the chain . in the part of the chain under study , of length @xmath4 , there just one impurity located in its middle between two magnetic sites .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1a],[eq:1b ] ) is rotationally invariant , so we can choose angles @xmath23 between two neighboring spins in the chain as variables characterizing the magnetic structure of the local spins . in the limit @xmath24 , only one of the spin components contributes to the low - lying states .",
    "starting from operators @xmath25 , we make a transformation to operators @xmath26 , which describe the creation of a conduction electron with its spin directed along each local spin @xmath27 ( spinless fermions ) .",
    "this modifies the hopping term that now depends on the magnetic structure of local spins . using angles @xmath23",
    ", we can write hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1a ] ) as :    @xmath28    where the coulomb form of the impurity potential is introduced explicitly , and @xmath29 .",
    "using hamiltonian  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we can write the partition function in the following form :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the basis electron wave functions , which are assumed to be orthogonal : @xmath33 in this expression , we suppose that @xmath34 are real numbers , because the matrix elements of operator @xmath13 in the @xmath35 basis are real .",

    "the physical meaning of this substitution is that the main contribution to @xmath39 comes from the term corresponding to the ground state of the conduction electron .",
    "since each electron in the ground state is trapped by its impurity , we can conclude that the its wave function only slightly depends on the canting angles .",

    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) .",
    "it can be easily seen from these equations that parameter @xmath52 is the mean energy of the electron in the @xmath53th state , that is @xmath54 .",
    "we can say that @xmath38 are the states of an electron moving in the averaged local spin background corresponding to these states .",
    "but , strictly speaking , only the state with @xmath55 ( `` ground '' state ) is the eigenstate of the averaged operator @xmath56 . is also an eigenstate of @xmath57 .",

    "the mean value of @xmath67 can be written in the following form :    @xmath70    we can also find mean values of physical observables in more complicated cases .",

    "for example , the mean value of @xmath65 is equal to @xmath72 . to test the approximate approach described above ,",
    "we calculate also the partition function and physical quantities characterizing the temperature behavior of the bound magnetic polaron using monte carlo simulations .",
    "partition function  ( [ z ] ) can be numerically calculated using standard diagonalization subroutines and a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . for a given local spin configuration ,",
    "the electronic hamiltonian is quadratic in the @xmath73 operators and can be exactly diagonalized .",
    "the remaining integrals over the local spin configurations can be calculated using a classical mc simulation .",
    "the mc simulation of the local spin system is done using the metropolis algorithm ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the metropolis algorithm generates a set of local spin configurations according to some probability distribution for the local spin angles .",
    "we use :    @xmath74    additional weight factor coming from the volume elements of integrals  ( [ z ] ) is included in the course of calculating the physical observables . note that for the diagonalization of the electronic hamiltonian , one needs to know the local spin configuration , and for the mc simulation of the local spin system",
    ", one needs to know the ground state of the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "we proceed as follows . starting from a given spin configuration , we diagonalize the electronic hamiltonian , and calculate @xmath75 .",
    "then we choose a site @xmath8 at random , and temporarily change @xmath76 .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian is again diagonalized and the new @xmath77 calculated . the change in canting angles is finally accepted according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we define a mc step as a number of these spin reorientations equal to the number of canting angles , @xmath78 .",
    "typically , we use series of several thousands of mc steps for each set of parameters of the hamiltonian and @xmath79 .",
    "a half of these steps is used to thermalize the system , and another half is used to calculate the physical observables .",
    "between each two mc steps , we discard 10 extra mc steps to avoid correlations between consecutive measurements .",
    "for the spin reorientations , the new value of the corresponding canting angle is randomly chosen .",
    "open boundary conditions are used at the ends of the chain . note that in contrast to the approximate method described in the previous subsection , the mc simulation can reveal some effects related to the dynamics of the conduction electron , the time being defined by the mc steps .",
    "we calculate partition function of the model ( [ eq:2 ] ) for the chain with @xmath80 sites at different values of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath81 .",
    "this length is representative of the low doping limit , and it is found that further increase of it does not change the obtained results . the impurity is placed in the middle of the chain between sites with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . to compare results given by variational method and mc simulation , we calculated the mean energy of the system @xmath84 in the temperature range @xmath85 .",
    "the calculations of function @xmath86 for different parameters of the model show that difference between both methods does not exceed several percent .",
    "some test mc calculations at higher temperatures also demonstrate a good agrement with approximate procedure .",
    "so , we believe that our variational approach is a good approximation even at high temperatures , and calculate physical quantities at @xmath87 using this method only .    as was already mentioned in section  [ sec2 ] , our methods allow us to calculate the wave function for the conduction electrons . from this",
    ", we can estimate the size of the bound ferron .",
    "we have used different set of parameters of the hamiltonian , and found that the size of magnetic polaron depends only slightly on the interaction between impurity and conduction electron , @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for @xmath88 magnetic polaron contains @xmath89 magnetic sites , whereas for @xmath90 it extends over @xmath91 sites .    to analyze the evolution of the magnetic polaron state with the growth of temperature",
    ", we calculate the correlation functions of neighbouring spins in the chain , i.e. mean values @xmath92 . for the temperature range @xmath93 ,",
    "we have performed the calculation of correlations function using both methods described above .",
    "corresponding curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath94 .",
    "it can be seen that both methods give similar results .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows that for the four sites closest to the impurity , we have ferromagnetic correlations , i.e. @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the remaining part of the chain exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations . at zero temperature ,",
    "local spins inside the ferron are nearly parallel each other , i.e. @xmath97 , whereas neighboring spins in the remaining part of the chain are antiparallel , i.e. @xmath98 .     +    due to one - dimensionality of the model , the magnetic phase transitions in the chain do not occur .",
    "nevertheless , we can introduce some characteristic temperatures describing our system .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlation functions , @xmath99 , between neighboring spins far from the impurity exhibit similar behavior",
    ". we may define temperature @xmath100 corresponding to the nel temperature of 3d heisenberg antiferromagnet in a conventional way , as the point of the steepest change in this correlation function ( that is the point where its curvature has a maximum ) .",
    "this temperature does not depend on @xmath1 , and equals approximately to @xmath101 , which is close to the mean - field estimate of this parameter . from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we see that it corresponds to the point where @xmath102 .    the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] demonstrate that the ferromagnetic correlations are significant for the first and second magnetic neighbors to the impurity , even at high temperature .",
    "the af correlations in the rest part of the chain decay much faster with temperatures .",
    "so , the ferron is a stable object that does not disappear even at @xmath103 .",
    "let study the temperature range in which the ferromagnetic correlations start to decay steeply ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we introduce , similarly to @xmath100 , a set of temperatures characterizing the magnetic polaron : @xmath104 , @xmath53 being the last site showing ferromagnetic correlations at zero temperature .",
    "namely , @xmath105 is the temperature corresponding to the maximum curvature of the plot shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig:2 ] for the correlation function for the sites nearest to the impurity . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we see that this temperature corresponds to the value @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , @xmath107 corresponds to the value at which @xmath108 , and so on . in the case of the sets of parameters corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , @xmath109 for @xmath88 , and @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "these temperatures are @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath88 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath111 , @xmath114 . at temperature @xmath118 in the case of @xmath88 , and at @xmath119 for @xmath111 ,",
    "the ferromagnetic correlations inside the ferron start to decay , and at @xmath120 , the ferron state completely disappears .",
    "the calculation shows that the ferron state is more stable at larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , this dependence is not very much pronounced : the change in the characteristic temperatures is by a factor of @xmath121 , when @xmath1 changes from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "the temperature @xmath105 , which characterizes the complete decay of the ferron , is in the range of @xmath124 .",
    "the value of @xmath105 can be obtained on the basis of following simple estimates . if we note that at @xmath105 all correlation functions except the first one go to zero , and that the wave function of the electron does not change very much with temperature , we can approximate the gain in energy of having a ferron state as @xmath125 . using that at @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and assuming that the wave function is uniformly distributed over the size of ferron",
    ", we have @xmath128 for the @xmath89-site ferron , @xmath129 for the @xmath91-site ferron . then , @xmath130 .",
    "also note that the relationship between @xmath105 and @xmath2 is similar to the relationship between the curie temperature @xmath131 and @xmath2 for the double exchange model .",
    "this similarity could have the same physical nature since in the latter model , the ferromagnetic ordering is related to the same hoping integral multiplied by the density of conduction electrons on a lattice site  @xcite .",
    "+     +   +   +    using our approximate variational method , we can analyze the case of @xmath132 .",
    "the plots for the correlation functions are very similar to those in of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b . in this limit",
    ", we have @xmath133 , so the ferron contains @xmath134 sites .",
    "the values of the corresponding characteristic temperatures are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , in our approach , we can describe both the ferron bound by impurity , and depinned from it .",
    "some indication of this possible depinning at small values of @xmath1 could come from the presence of small ferromagnetic correlation corresponding to the fourth pair at high temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) .    to study the possible depinning in a more detailed way",
    ", we calculate the quantum - mechanical mean position @xmath139 of the conduction electron for each mc time , where @xmath140 .",
    "dependence of mean position @xmath141 on mc time is shown in insets to fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in this figure",
    ", we also show the histograms illustrating probability distribution of @xmath141 in the temperature range @xmath85 , and for the set of parameters @xmath142 . in the insets",
    "we can see that at temperatures @xmath143 , there appears a large scatter in the values of mean position @xmath141 .",
    "simultaneously , the probability distribution broadens .",
    "this means that an electron becomes depinned and can move far away from the impurity .",
    "since the depinning temperature is , at least , lower than the temperatures @xmath144 for the same values of @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , we can conclude that the ferron retains its magnetic structure after depinning . at sufficiently large values of @xmath1 , the depinning of a ferron",
    "is not observed in the temperature range under study .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the standard deviation of the histograms of @xmath141 as a function of temperature for several values of @xmath1 . in all cases",
    ", the standard deviation has a maximum for some @xmath145 . at relatively low temperatures",
    ", @xmath146 grows due to the increase in the thermal fluctuations of the ferron position . at higher temperatures , the ferromagnetic correlations forming the ferron gradually decay , and the electron undergoes a kind of anderson localization in disordered spin background ( the situation typical of the double exchange mechanism ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath146 eventually decreases independently of the value of coulomb potential @xmath1 .",
    "we can also find the depinning line using the variational method .",
    "let us consider the ferron state bound to the impurity and the state at @xmath147 .",
    "the latter case corresponds also to the free ferron located far from the impurity .",
    "the energy difference between bound and free ferron states then equals to @xmath148 .",
    "the depinning temperature @xmath149 can be estimated as : @xmath150 where the mean energy of the system @xmath151 is calculated by variational method using formula  .",
    "note that the depinning temperature calculated in such a way turns out to be in several times greater than its value estimated by monte carlo simulations , because in latter case we consider the states corresponding to the ferron located not far from the impurity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we present the phase diagram of the chain in @xmath152 plane . the temperatures @xmath153 as a functions of the impurity potential are shown .",
    "we also plot the temperature @xmath100 and the depinning line calculated by the variational method .",
    "we show that the simple model of an antiferromagnetic chain with impurities captures the essential features of the phase separation in low - doped manganites .",
    "we find a set of temperatures characterizing the thermal evolution of the magnetic structure of such a chain .",
    "we demonstrate that the magnetic state of the chain is rather inhomogeneous and it can be described by a set of magnetic polarons .",
    "these magnetic polarons are rather stable objects existing at temperature even much higher than the nel temperature of the undoped chain . with the growth of temperature ,",
    "ferromagnetic correlations inside the ferron start to disappear in a step - wise way , up to some temperature @xmath154 , and then ferron state is no longer stable .",
    "the dynamics of ferrons depends on the magnitude of the electron - impurity coupling , @xmath1 . at high values of @xmath1 ,",
    "ferron remains tightly bound by impurity , while at lower @xmath1 , the ferron can be depinned from impurity at a characteristic temperature lower than @xmath105 , and therefore retains its magnetic structure after depinning .",
    "these results can be summarized in the phase diagram in the @xmath152 plane presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we can see that in region below the rather flat curve @xmath105 versus @xmath1 , there are the regions of stability of different kinds of ferrons , from @xmath109 to @xmath134 sites . in each such region , we show the dashed line corresponding to the melting of the last ferromagnetically correlated pair in the ferron .",
    "so , between the solid and each dashed line , we have the region where the ferron gradually decays .",
