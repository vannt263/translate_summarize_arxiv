    "the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , has been the object of theoretical and experimental scrutiny for four decades now and is perturbatively well defined . indeed , at large momentum transfer , perturbative calculations successfully describe a wealth of subatomic phenomena .",
    "however , qcd is also a theory whose elementary excitations are confined and even in the far infrared below the typical hadronic scale , @xmath6  gev , qcd does not seem to break down  @xcite . thus , nonperturbatively qcd may well be rigorously defined but a full solution is yet out of reach : there exists no simple schrdinger picture of a many - body hamiltonian as in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the intrinsic nonperturbative nature of quark - antiquark pair creation and annihilation in a relativistic quantum field theory , which entails non - conservation of particle number . in hadron physics",
    ", this situation leads to seek computational approaches beyond perturbative qcd and many models or effective theories have been proposed to tackle qcd in the nonperturbative regime with the aim to describe hadron phenomenology .    in this context ,",
    "one possibility to develop a nonperturbative covariant framework is the light - front field theory formalism proposed by dirac in 1949  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the hadronic bound states are described by wave functions in the light - front space - time hyper surface , defined by the coordinate @xmath7 , and due to the stability of the fock - state decomposition these wave functions are covariant under kinematic boosts  @xcite .    on the other hand , in understanding the dynamical properties of nonperturbative qcd , the light pseudoscalar mesons and in particular the pion play a crucial role . remarkably , the latter is a bound state of massive antiquark - quark pairs as well as the almost massless goldstone boson associated with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "there have been many studies of their static properties  @xcite and their dynamical properties have also been investigated theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the simple structure of the fock space and the vacuum in light - front quantization , various hadronic properties of bound states , such as decay constants and electromagnetic form factors of the pion , kaon and nucleon , have been calculated @xcite and successfully compared with their experimental values  @xcite .",
    "since the light front component , @xmath1 , has been successfully employed to calculate electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , the light - front approach also offers a theoretical framework to extract from them useful information on the valence and non - valence components of the meson s wave function .    in the present simultaneous study of electromagnetic form factors , charge radii and decay constants",
    ", we adopt the light - front field theory formalism of refs .  @xcite",
    "wherein the bethe - salpeter amplitude of the @xmath8 bound states was modeled for two different momentum constellations , namely a symmetric  @xcite and nonsymmetric vertex model  @xcite . here",
    ", the vertex refers to the @xmath9 pair coupling to the pseudoscalar meson in an effective lagrangian . using a nonsymmetric vertex model , e.  o.  silva _ et .",
    "@xcite calculated the aforementioned pion and kaon observables which are in agreement with experimental data . however , a momentum distribution of the meson that is symmetric under the exchange of the quark and antiquark momenta is more realistic and such a model for the bethe - salpeter amplitude should improve the description of or at least equally well reproduce all observables presented in ref .",
    "thus , we here use the same component , @xmath1 , of the light - front electromagnetic current , though with a symmetric momentum description of quark - meson bound - state vertex .",
    "it is important to recall here that the choice of @xmath1 with the drell - yan condition @xmath10 guarantees that pair - term contributions ( non - valence terms ) vanish  @xcite . on the other hand , to preserve rotational symmetry , the pair contribution must be included  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we here employ both the valence and non - valence contributions considering the case @xmath11 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] serves to summarize the general framework where subsequently the different physical observables , namely the electromagnetic form factors , decay constant and charge radii are discussed in turn . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present our numerical results and analyze the observables dependence on variation of the model parameters . in the last section ,",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the model and the computational tools of the light - front formalism required to investigate the pseudoscalar meson s electromagnetic form factors , charge radii and the decay constants .",
    "our approach is based on similar earlier work  @xcite , where the following effective lagrangian for the @xmath9 bound state was employed : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the mass and decay constant of a pseudoscalar meson , respectively , and @xmath16 represents the scalar field .",

    "we discuss the analytic light - front formulation of the electromagnetic form factor , charge radius and decay constant .      the covariant electromagnetic form factor , @xmath23 is defined by a matrix element where the electromagnetic current , @xmath24 , is sandwiched between the initial and final bound states of the same meson : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the square of the momentum transfer .    the electromagnetic form factor in the impulse approximation is obtained from triangle diagrams , each of which contains one spectator quark . in this approximation , the covariant electromagnetic current of a pseudoscalar meson , @xmath29 , that enters eq .",
