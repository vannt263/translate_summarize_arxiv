    "numerous processes in meson physics are related to the adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) axial anomaly @xcite appearing in the fermion loops connecting certain number of axial ( a ) and vector ( v ) vertices . concretely , in this paper we will deal with the processes related to the avv (  triangle \" , fig .

    "there are six different contributing graphs , obtained from the above graph by the permutations of the vertices of the three different pions .",
    "the position of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 quark flavors on the internal lines , as well as @xmath9 or @xmath10 quark charges in the quark - photon vertex , varies from graph to graph , depending on the position of the quark - pion vertices .",
    "the physical pion fields are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the momenta flowing through the four sections of the quark loop are conveniently given by various combinations of the symbols @xmath13 in @xmath14.,height=151 ]    suppose one wants to describe such processes using qcd - related effective chiral meson lagrangians @xcite without adding ad hoc interactions of mesons with external gauge fields to reproduce empirical results .",
    "for example , one can add by hand @xmath15 and this would reproduce the observed @xmath1 width for the favorable value of the @xmath16 coupling @xmath17 . however ,",
    "if one does not want to add such ad hoc terms in the effective meson lagrangians , one must describe such `` anomalous '' processes through the term derived by wess and zumino @xcite . on the other hand , if one wants to utilize and explicitly take into account the fact that mesons are composed of quarks , another way of describing these processes is optimal in our opinion , and the main purpose of this paper is to stress and elucidate this .",
    "axial vertices in the anomalous graphs such as the avv and vaaa ones , couple the quarks with pseudoscalar mesons . instead of anomalous graphs ,",
    "another way to study the related amplitudes involving pseudoscalar mesons , is to calculate the corresponding graphs where axial vertices ( a ) are replaced by pseudoscalar ( p ) ones .",
    "thereby , for example , the @xmath1 decay amplitude due to the avv  triangle anomaly \" , @xmath18 is reproduced by the calculation of the pvv triangle graph .",
    "( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) pertains to the chiral limit , where the pion mass @xmath19 .",
    "also , @xmath20 is the pion decay constant , @xmath21 is the proton charge , and @xmath22 is the number of quark colors . ]",

    "( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) can most simply be done essentially _ ` a la _",
    "steinberger @xcite , that is , with a loop of `` free '' constituent quarks with the point pseudoscalar coupling ( i.e. , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ) to quasi - elementary pion fields .",
    "however , since the development of the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach to quark - hadron physics @xcite , the presently advocated method becomes even more convincing .",
    "namely , the ds approach clearly shows how the light pseudoscalar mesons simultaneously appear both as quark - antiquark ( @xmath25 ) bound states and as goldstone bosons of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath26sb ) of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the solutions of bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations for the bound - state vertices of pseudoscalar mesons then enter in the pvv triangle graph instead of the point @xmath23 coupling , and the current algebra result ( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) is again reproduced exactly and analytically , which is unique among the bound - state approaches . that the ( almost massless ) pseudoscalars are ( quasi-)goldstone bosons , is also a unique feature among the bound - state approaches to mesons .",
    "a reason why the p - coupling method is simpler both technically and conceptually is that the pvv triangle graph amplitude is _ finite _ , unlike the avv one , which is divergent and therefore also ambiguous with respect to the momentum routing .",
    "reference gives a more detailed discussion of the p - coupling method and why is that it is equivalent to the anomaly calculations , and illustrates this on the examples of the famous decay @xmath27 and processes of the type @xmath2 .",
    "also , the pvv quark triangle amplitude leads to many ( over 15 ) decay amplitudes in agreement with data to within 3% and not involving free parameters @xcite .",
    "this will be elaborated in more detail in sec .",
    "[ manyproc ] .",
    "additional advantages of this method is that its treatment of the @xmath28-@xmath29 complex and resolution of the @xmath30 problem , goes well with the absence of axions ( which were predicted to solve the strong cp problem but have _ not _ yet been observed @xcite ) and with the arguments of ref .  , that there is really no strong cp problem .",

    "the approach using the pseudoscalar coupling is , in our opinion , also relevant for the effects related to the non - abelian ,  gluon \" abj axial anomaly . here , we comment on this only briefly , and direct the reader to the original references for details .",
    "the first point concerns the @xmath28-@xmath29 complex and the @xmath0 problem related to it .    in the chiral limit @xmath103 , since all members of the flavor - su(3 ) pseudoscalar meson octet are massless in this theoretical , but very useful limit .",
    "the only non - vanishing ground - state pseudoscalar meson mass in this limit is the mass of the su(3)-singlet pseudoscalar meson @xmath104 .",
    "this is thanks to the non - abelian , gluon abj axial anomaly , i.e. , to the fact that the divergence of the su(3)-singlet axial current @xmath105 receives the contributions from both the finite quark masses and gluon fields @xmath106 : @xmath107 this removes the @xmath0 symmetry and explains why only eight pseudoscalar mesons are light , and not nine ; i.e. , why there is an octet of ( almost-)goldstone bosons , but not a nonet .",

    "both of these assignments are in conflict with experiment .",
    "the realistic contributions of various flavors to @xmath28 and @xmath29 and their masses ( i.e. , the realistic @xmath28-@xmath29 mixing ) are obtained only thanks to @xmath126 , the anomalous contribution to the mass matrix . in @xmath126",

    "equivalently , @xmath140 can be viewed as being generated by the transitions among the @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath56 pseudoscalar states ; via quark loops , these pseudoscalar @xmath144 bound states can annihilate into gluons which in turn via another quark loop can again recombine into another pseudoscalar @xmath145 bound state of the same or different flavor .",
    "the quantity @xmath127 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ secondu1amass ] ) is then the annihilation strength of such transitions , in the limit of an exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "( the realistic breaking of this symmetry is easily introduced and improves our description of the @xmath28-@xmath29 complex considerably . )",
    "the `` diamond '' graph in fig .",

    "can it then be founded to think that the annihilation graphs with the pseudoscalar meson - quark coupling , such as the `` diamond '' graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond ] , give rise to the anomalous term @xmath148 in the divergence ( [ divganom ] ) of the su(3)-singlet current @xmath149 , and thus ultimately to the large mass of @xmath150 ( and of the observed @xmath29 ) ?",

    "@xcite , that there is really no strong cp problem .",
    "they find that one does _ not _ need vanishing @xmath156 ( where @xmath157 is the quark mass matrix ) .",
    "thus , one does not need any fine - tuning , and all cp violation in the qcd lagrangian can be avoided by having @xmath158 in its cp - violating term @xmath159 this term in the qcd lagrangian breaks the @xmath0 symmetry and corresponds to the anomalous term @xmath160 in the divergence ( [ divganom ] ) of the singlet current .",
    "the term ( [ thetaqcd ] ) is allowed by gauge invariance and renormalizability , but apparent nonexistence of the strong cp violation , and also of axions , is the solid reason to have it vanishing . our conjecture , that p - coupled annihilation graphs reproduce the effect of the gluon abj anomaly , naturally agrees with the vanishing of this term and with putting the case of the strong cp problem to rest _  la _ banerjee _ et al .",
    "we have presented and surveyed in detail the method of pseudoscalar coupling of pseudoscalar mesons to the  triangle \" and  box \" quark loops .",

    "physicists have tried to circumvent this `` @xmath0  strong cp problem '' either via the topology of gauge fields or by investigating the @xmath161vacuum for this strong cp problem @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have circumvented the need to deal directly with the above photon or gluon avv anomalies by studying instead ( finite ) pvv quark triangle graphs .",
