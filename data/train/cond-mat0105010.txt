    "<S> electronic structures of ndnio@xmath0 and ynio@xmath0 are calculated by using lsda+u method with rotational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the jahn - teller distortion is not allowed under the observed magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> no orbital order on ni sites can not be observed in the calculation of both systems but different types of charge ordering . in a small distorting system </S>",
    "<S> ndnio@xmath0 , all ni ions are trivalent and oxygen sites have a particular ordering , both in charge and orbital . in a large distorting system ynio@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the charge disproportionation occurs , 2ni@xmath1 ni@xmath2ni@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the charge ordering stabilizes the asymmetry of the arrangement of ni magnetic moments in both systems .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 perovskite transition metal oxides are now of high interest because of the large variety and the possible controllability of their physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> perovskite nickelates rnio@xmath0 ( r = an trivalent rare earth or y ions ) can be classified into three different categories , according to their tolerance factor ( @xmath4 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one is those whose tolerance factor is much smaller ( @xmath5 ) and has a larger distortion , such as lunio@xmath0 or ynio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> they are antiferromagnetic insulators at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this class of rnio@xmath0 undergoes transition to paramagnetic insulator at the neel temperature @xmath6 and also has another phase transition from paramagnetic insulator to paramagnetic metal ( m - i transition ) at very high transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> second is those whose tolerance factor is intermediate ( @xmath7 ) , such as ndnio@xmath0 or prnio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these materials are also antiferromagnetic insulators at low temperatures and above @xmath6 they are paramagnetic metals .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite third is lanio@xmath0 where @xmath8 and is paramagnetic metal .    low temperature phase of above mentioned first and second classes of rnio@xmath0 have the unique magnetic structures .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite its magnetic diffraction peak is characterized by the propagation vector @xmath9 and the magnetic unit cell is identified as the @xmath10 supercell of the crystallographic lattice .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the magnetic order is specified to be alternating ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings @xmath11 along three crystallographic directions .    on the contrary to the asymmetric arrangement of magnetic bonds ( fm / afm ) around each nickel site , ni - o distances around each ni ion are almost equal to each other . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the difference between the longest and the shortest ni - o bonds in one nio@xmath12 octahedron is at most 2% in rnio@xmath0 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the jahn - teller distortion is absent in rnio@xmath0 , even in the largely distorted system ynio@xmath0 , whose tolerance factor is 0.88 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally there is only one crystallographic site for ni ions in ndnio@xmath0 and two different sites for ni ions in ynio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can expect trivalent ions ni@xmath13 in ndnio@xmath0 . on the contrary , ni ions in ynio@xmath0 are divalent and quadrivalent , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the charge disproportionation 2ni@xmath1 ni@xmath2ni@xmath3 occurs .    in this letter , we study the electronic properties of the afm insulating phase of two perovskite nickelates , ndnio@xmath0 and ynio@xmath0 , which are typical ones of above mentioned two respective classes . </S>",
    "<S> we use the lsda+u method with the rotational invariance in conjunction with the lmto - asa method .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the lsda+u method counts the electron - electron interaction between localized orbitals by the hartree - fock type interaction term . </S>",
    "<S> the ionic positions and lattice parameters used in the present calculations are imported from the diffraction experiments .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the unit cell here is the @xmath14 crystallographic supercell containing 16 nd or y ions , 16 ni ions , and 48 o ions and , in addition , 32 empty spheres , totally 112 atomic spheres . </S>",
    "<S> sixty - four k - points in the brillouin zone are sampled in the calculation of the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> ndnio@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic up to @xmath15 , but the nd spin moment vanishes at about 30k .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , three 4f electrons of nd ion are counted in the frozen core . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the electronic structure of ndnio@xmath0 with 4f electrons in valence states , and the results show no significant difference . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb and exchange parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 of ni ions are fixed to be 7.0  ev and 0.88  ev , respectively , through all the lsda+u calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these values are consistent with photoemission experiments and the results of the lsda calculations </S>",
    "<S> .   calculated results are not changed much over a large range of values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the crystallographic space groups of ndnio@xmath0 and ynio@xmath0 are orthorhombic @xmath18 and monoclinic @xmath19 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the group theoretical analysis shows that , using the projection operator method , the jahn - teller distortion of one nio@xmath12 octahedron can not be transfered over the whole enlarged @xmath20 supercell with @xmath21 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , the jahn - teller distortion actually can not appear in the observed spin ordered state .    </S>",
    "<S> ndnio@xmath0 : there are two possible spin configurations in @xmath22 satisfying the observed transfer vectors @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the spin magnetic moments align ferromagnetically on the ( 101 ) plane and the planes are stacked with a doubled period as @xmath23 , whose magnetic space group is monoclinic @xmath24 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this spin configuration is assumed in the present letter . another possible spin configuration with @xmath25 spin order could be the doubled period checkerboard stacking along crystallographic @xmath26-axis , and the magnetic space group is orthorhombic @xmath27 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the state of @xmath27 shows orbital ordering of e@xmath28 states on ni sites , but the resultant calculated total energy is higher by 0.18  ev per @xmath29 cell than that of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> because there is no possibility of subsidiary jahn - teller distortion to lower the total energy , @xmath27 could not be the symmetry to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy is also calculated in a fictitious antiferromagnetic state of @xmath30 whose magnetic unit cell is identical to the crystallographic one and is higher by 2.0  ev per @xmath31 cell .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig - ndnio3-pdos ] shows the projected density of states on the ni 3d orbitals in ndnio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is insulator with a gap @xmath32ev . </S>",
    "<S> each nickel ion has the local magnetic moment @xmath33 within the atomic sphere of a radius @xmath34 , contrary to the observed value of @xmath35 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it should be noticed that the local magnetic moment can not be uniquely defined . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , ndnio@xmath0 is not a simple antiferromagnetic insulator but a dynamical effect is essential , which may be an origin of this discrepancy .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite there is no distinctive variation in partial spin density of states of ni site in each magnetic sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> an e@xmath28 band lies on the energy range @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers of states in the energy ranges @xmath37 and @xmath38 are 16 , respectively , which are the one occupied and one vacant e@xmath28 states per ni ion . actually , these e@xmath28 orbitals extend over surrounding oxygen sites from ni ions due to strong hybridization between ni e@xmath28 and o p orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the extended occupied e@xmath28 orbital has a 60% weight on p orbitals on surrounding six oxygens , a 10% weight on an individual oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one would establish a model where one occupied e@xmath28 state with majority spin locates at the top of the valence bands , and it hybridizes strongly with the p states on nearby o ions . </S>",
    "<S> this is the molecular orbital @xmath39 state .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite then one can assign all nickel ions in ndnio@xmath0 to be trivalent ni@xmath13 ( t@xmath40e@xmath41 ) , even though the ni ion is not truly ionized by + 3 charge . in the projected density of states of ni ion site </S>",
    "<S> , one observes a large amount of e@xmath28 states at the bottom of the d bands , which are the bonding states between ni d and o p , corresponding to the @xmath42 states in the molecular orbital picture .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the e@xmath28 band in the range @xmath43 does not show any orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , off - diagonal elements within the e@xmath28 subblock of the occupation matrix @xmath44 are zero and the diagonal elements are identical </S>",
    "<S> . the absence of the orbital ordering may be consistent with the fact that the @xmath45 $ ] axis has three - fold rotational symmetry in the present spin configuration , once the distortion is neglected . due to this pseudo three - fold rotational symmetry , the basis orbitals of e@xmath28 representation of the trigonal group d@xmath46 is a good basis set and those derived from e@xmath28 orbitals are @xmath47 and @xmath48 . therefore , there is no difference between the occupancies of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig - ndnio3-sd ] is the spatial profiles of spin densities @xmath51 in the energy range @xmath52 ( @xmath39 state ) . </S>",
    "<S> only one spin component of o p orbitals on the fm bond is bridging between two ni e@xmath28 orbitals , while both spin components on the afm bond couple with ni e@xmath28 orbitals of respective spins . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , oxygen ions on the afm bond have more charge in this energy range than oxygen on the fm bond . </S>",
    "<S> this is the realization of oxygen - site charge - ordered state discussed by mizokawa _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the framework of the hartree - fock calculation .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the charge difference between oxygen sites of ni@xmath53-@xmath54-ni@xmath53 and ni@xmath53-@xmath55-ni@xmath56 in @xmath39 states is mostly compensated by hybridized @xmath42 state at lower energies . besides , all oxygen ions have no local magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> more significant results seen in fig .  [ fig - ndnio3-sd ] may be the p orbital ordering on oxygen sites . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic space group is @xmath24 and its unitary part is @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell and lattice primitive vectors are not identical to those in @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin density in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ndnio3-sd ] is consistent with this magnetic group @xmath24 , neither higher nor lower than this . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry lowering of the unitary part @xmath57 is the origin of the opening the band gap at @xmath58 in the majority spin band , despite to the absence of the orbital ordering on ni sites ( _ i.e. _ symmetry driven band gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can conclude that the origin of the insulator phase at low temperatures in ndnio@xmath0 is the characteristic spin density on the oxygen sites or , equivalently , the orbital ordering there . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap @xmath59  ev is due to the symmetry of charge order . in fictitious ideal cubic structure without distortion or tilting of nio@xmath12 octahedra , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes metal whose valence and conduction bands touch at points with each other .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the structure of @xmath39 bands is insensitive to the value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the band gap is unchanged down to @xmath60  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the gap is driven by the symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> ynio@xmath0 : one should expect larger distortion in ynio@xmath0 because ynio@xmath0 is the typical system with the small tolerance factor .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite there are two different crystallographic ni sites , and the distances from each ni ion to surrounding o ion are different by 3@xmath614% from one type of ni ion to the other type .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite calculated self - consistent solution is that with the apparent charge disproportionation and no orbital polarization . </S>",
    "<S> since ni@xmath3 site has no spin magnetic moment , the two spin configurations discussed in ndnio@xmath0 become identical and the spin configuration of ynio@xmath0 is uniquely determined . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic space group is @xmath62 if the spins of ni@xmath3 ions are non vanishing and , on the contrary , @xmath63 if the spins of ni@xmath3 ions are zero . </S>",
    "<S> the latter symmetry @xmath63 is actually the case .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig - ynio3-pdos ] shows the projected density of states at ni ion sites . the system is insulator with a gap @xmath64ev . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant magnetic moments for half of ni ions are @xmath65 within the atomic sphere of a radius @xmath66 , namely divalent ions ni@xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> ( t@xmath40e@xmath68 ) , of larger nio@xmath12 octahedron and zero for another half of ni ions within the atomic sphere of a radius @xmath34 , namely quadrivalent ni@xmath3 ( t@xmath40 ) , of smaller octahedron . the experimentally observed magnetic moments are @xmath69 for ni@xmath67 ions and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 for ni@xmath3 ions .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the discrepancy may be due to a possible non - collinear spin order . </S>",
    "<S> the number of states in the energy range @xmath71 is 16 and dominant weight on ni@xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> because the number of ni@xmath67 in the @xmath14 cell is 8 , these states are assigned as two e@xmath28 states mainly on ni@xmath67 and surrounding oxygens . </S>",
    "<S> the e@xmath28 orbitals of ni@xmath3 is lifted in the higher energy range ( @xmath72 ) without spin polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> a large amount of e@xmath28 orbitals in ni@xmath67 ions locates at the bottom of the d bands , in the range @xmath73 for ni@xmath67 , and in the range @xmath74 for ni@xmath3 , stabilizes the bonding between ni@xmath3 ions and oxygen ions . from these facts </S>",
    "<S> , one can establish a model that deep @xmath42 molecular orbitals ( one per both ni@xmath67 and ni@xmath3 ) stabilize the system , and other two e@xmath28 states ( @xmath39 states ) per one ni@xmath67 ion located at @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> the charge disproportionation is mainly due to the crystal field effect . </S>",
    "<S> the low spin state in ni@xmath3 or ni@xmath13 ion is energetically unstable in small @xmath76 case and the ground state multiplet of ni@xmath67 is @xmath77a@xmath78 ( t@xmath40e@xmath68 ) for all arbitrary values of @xmath76 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , the small tolerance factor causes two different ni sites , compressed ni@xmath3 ( large @xmath76 ) and dilated ni@xmath67 ( small @xmath76 ) , rather than uniformly dilated ni@xmath13 ionic states .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the standard values of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the racah parameter ) for ni@xmath67 is presumably around 1.0 . once one estimate the crystal field effects from the ni - o bond lengths @xmath81 , the difference of @xmath82 on two ni ion sites is presumably about 20% .    </S>",
    "<S> two narrow e@xmath28 bands can be seen in the energy range @xmath83 and @xmath84 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ynio3-pdos]a . </S>",
    "<S> two ni@xmath67  e@xmath28 states are spatially extending over wide area and not only hybridizing with the nearest neighbor o ions but also extending over the nearest @xmath85 ions . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is well depicted in the spin density . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig - ynio3-sd ] shows the isometric surfaces of the spin density in the range of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the d - wavefunctions on ni@xmath67 are extending over the ( 101 ) plane , and antiferromagnetically coupled with other ni@xmath67 ions . </S>",
    "<S> charge in each ni ion is compensated in ynio@xmath0 as in ndnio@xmath0 and the difference between total charges in the muffin tin spheres on ni@xmath67 and ni@xmath3 sites is very small , equals to 0.03 . </S>",
    "<S> this variation is the same order as that of oxygen ions in ndnio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , charge disproportionation is coupled with the lattice distortion , where larger oxygen octahedron is surrounding ni@xmath67 , and stabilizes the lattice system in ynio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , diffraction experiment can detect the charge ordering in the yttrium system easier than in the neodymium system .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied two typical antiferromagnetic insulating phase of rnio@xmath0 , ndnio@xmath0 and ynio@xmath0 , by using the lsda+u method . a possibility of the jahn - teller distortion is excluded by the group theoretical consideration . </S>",
    "<S> no orbital order on ni sites is observed in both systems , but two different types of ordering are observed . in small distorting rnio@xmath0 such as ndnio@xmath0 , oxygen sites shows the orbital ordering and this is the origin of the gap opening in ndnio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in large distorting rnio@xmath0 such as ynio@xmath0 , the charge disproportionation 2ni@xmath86ni@xmath2ni@xmath3 occurs . the charge ordering mechanism </S>",
    "<S> can explain the stabilization of the asymmetric alignment of the local magnetic moments around each nickel site in both systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we may add the final comment about effects of electron - electron correlation in rnio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of the calculated e@xmath28 bands @xmath87 by the lda are @xmath88(ynio@xmath0 ) , @xmath89(ndnio@xmath0 ) , and @xmath90(lanio@xmath0 ) . then , the ratio of @xmath91 may be estimated as @xmath92 , assuming the value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath16 is common for all , and one can see a large reduction of @xmath91 in lanio@xmath0 , which may be the key parameter for the difference of the ground states of these perovskite nickelates . </S>",
    "<S> ndnio@xmath0 shows the anomalous m - i transition .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite lanio@xmath0 is presumably an anomalous metal of strongly correlated electrons  @xcite and could not be treated within the framework of the lsda+u method . </S>"
