    "future wireless communication systems should support various multimedia services , such as voice over ip ( voip ) , video streaming , interactive gaming and peer - to - peer ( p2p ) file transfer , etc .",
    "because of these various multimedia services , the traffic asymmetry property will be very remarkable .",
    "it can be envisaged that in the networks , e.g. , the 3gpp lte release 12/13 networks , small cells will prioritize time division duplexing ( tdd ) schemes over frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) ones since tdd transmissions are particularly suitable for hot spot scenarios with traffic fluctuations in both link directions [ 1 ] . in normal tdd system ,",
    "the dl / ul slot assignment is fixed and aligned among the neighboring cells , which is the so - called static and synchronized tdd . in this line ,",
    "a new technology has recently emerged , referred to as dynamic tdd , in which tdd dl and ul subframes can be dynamically configured in small cells to adapt their communication service to the fast variation of dl / ul traffic demands in either direction .",
    "the application of dynamic tdd in homogeneous small cell networks has been investigated in recent works with positive results [ 2 ] .    in the dynamic tdd networks , the configuration of the dl / ul resource can be done separately for each cell .",
    "thereafter the main practical technical challenge is the emergence of new types of inter - cell interference such as interference between neighboring base stations ( enb - to - enb ) and between user terminals ( ue - to - ue ) .",
    "the enb - enb interference is especially detrimental and has been shown to significantly impact ul performance[3 ] . to mitigate the interference of the lte or lte - a networks , some schemes have been studied[4][5 ] .    to alleviate the interference problems ( enb - to - enb or ue - to - ue interference ) of the dynamic tdd system , several schemes were proposed . in [ 6 ] ,",
    "the authors study cell clustering based techniques .",
    "the ability of a base station to measure the signal from another base station is hence a key ingredient of such a method",
    ". soft frequency reuse ( sfr ) schemes were investigated under lte framework to provide a higher rate to disadvantaged cell - edge ues [ 7][8 ] .",
    "sfr , which utilizes resource blocks ( rb ) allocation in cluster cells , is an effective method to mitigate inter - cell interference in downlink service system .",
    "however , for the system with both uplink and downlink loads , its spectrum efficiency is low because the outward users close to the cell edge in a cell can not utilize the all frequency resource . in [ 9 ] , the authors investigate an inter - cell coordination scheme that coordinates the transmission time and mode of users in neighboring cells .",
    "since neighboring cells can select dl / ul configuration separately and ecperience different interference in different subframes , some power control schemes arise .",
    "each enb adjusts the transmit power in some specific dl subframes which may cause severe enb - to - enb interference to the neighboring cells[10 ] . also , two power control schemes are studied , one in which the ul subframe sets are configured statically and the other in which the ul subframe sets are configured dynamically and are changed according to the continuously monitored interference level [ 11 ] . in the above power control schemes ,",
    "the reconfiguration information of neighboring cells in the actual scenario can not be considered . in this paper , we focus on ue transmit power adjustments process based on the interference level and its performance in combatting the strong enb - to - enb interference . in particular , we consider the geometric location information and the subframe set selection process of interfering enbs to measure the interference level .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : network scenario information is provided in section ii .",
    "the proposed ul power control scheme is presented in section iii .",
    "simulation results and some concluding remarks are provided in section v and vi , respectively .",
    "the work in lte release 12 on dynamic tdd reconfiguration builds on release 11 studies , both known as enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation ( eimta ) . various heterogeneous scenarios ( pico cells only , macro - pico cells , macro - femto cells ) with co - channel and adjacent channel deployments",
    "were considered for eimta [ 1 ] . of these scenarios ,",
    "multiple outdoor pico cells with and without macro coverage were selected as the best candidates and the following two scenarios were given highest priority :    @xmath0 multiple outdoor co - channel pico cells    @xmath0 and multiple outdoor co - channel pico cells with adjacent channel macro cells .    it is observed that for the case of very low adjacent channel interference ratio , the second scenario essentially reduces to two independent deployments , one consisting of just macro cells and the other of just pico cells . in this paper",
    ", we adopt this scenario just focus on the types of interference in pico cells .",
    "fig.1 shows a heterogeneous network deployment with multiple tdd pico cells in the macro cell area and highlights the enb - to - enb and ue - to - ue interference encountered in a pico cell based td - lte system assuming the macro cell interference can be ignored .",
    "pico1 cell and pico2 cell have different configurations .",
    "when the cells transmit in the fourth subframe , enb2 will interfere enb1 in transmitting mode .",
    "similarly , ue a will also interfere ue b in receiving mode .",
    "ul power control in lte , which is one of the mechanisms used for combatting interference , comprises both open and closed loop components as well as adjustments based on transmission parameters .",
    "the open loop component uses the target received power at the cell , @xmath1 , and an estimate of the dl path loss weighted by a compensation factor , @xmath2 , to adjust the terminal power where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are provided by the enb .",
    "the closed loop component adjusts the terminal transmit power via explicitly transmitted power control commands . in a subframe",
    ", power is set on a channel basis per component carrier ( in the case of carrier aggregation ) and then reduced if the ue maximum power would be exceeded by the sum of the channel power .",
    "details of ul power control can be found in section 5.1 in [ 12 ] .    in lte release 12 , subframe set",
    "based power control has been introduced whereby each of two sets of subframes can have its own set of open loop power control parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and separate transmit power control commands ( tpc ) .",
    "determination of power in a subframe is based on the open loop and closed loop components that apply to the subframe set to which the subframe belongs .",
    "dynamic td - lte system has 7 different dl / ul configurations as shown in fig.2 . and enbs select corresponding configurations to adapt the traffic .",
    "configuration 0 will not cause enb - to - enb interference to any other configurations . for configuration 1 - 6 , since the special subframe is usually used as downlink subframe , therefore , there are no enb - to - enb and ue - to - ue interference in subframe @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this paper only needs to consider the possible interference in subframe @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for conveniences , subframe @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "are referred as fis ( fixed subframe ) and the other subframes are called as fls ( flexible subframe ) .    in order to improve the quality of uplink , a feasible method is to increase the received signal sinr in the subframes which suffer from the enb - to - enb interference .",
    "the sinr of enb @xmath4 is    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the effective ue transmission power which enb @xmath4 receives , @xmath7 is white gaussian noise and @xmath8 is the received interference signal power from adjacent enbs",
    ". then we have    @xmath9    assume @xmath10 is the number of interfering enbs , @xmath11 is the received interference signal power from enb @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the transmission power of enb @xmath12 and @xmath14 is the path loss between enb @xmath4 and the interfering enb @xmath12 .    for increasing the sinr ,",
    "a method is to enhance @xmath6 and another is to reduce @xmath13 . however",
    ", lte systems should avoid changing enbs transmission power frequently .",
    "therefore , in the proposed scheme , we achieve this goal by increasing @xmath6 properly . the appropriate ue transmit power @xmath6 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16)are set to small cells for fis and fls , respectively .",
    "the interference level is different in different subframes of neighboring cells , thus @xmath17 should changes synchronously .",
    "if the neighboring cells adopt different dl / ul configurations , the interference depends on the flexible ul subframe itself and it may be , for example , different in subframe @xmath33 than in @xmath38 . although subframe @xmath33 and @xmath38 belong to fls .    in this proposed scheme , the first step of the power adjustment is to estimate the number of the interfering enbs , and each enb sends the ul configuration information to the interfered ones .",
    "then the interfered enbs will calculate the interference level and the ues carry out power control process based on the indicator to mitigate its interference .",
    "these steps will be also done periodically .",
    "the details of each step will be given in the following sections .",
    "due to the different distance and propagation environment , the interference levels of enbs are also different and we only regard the strong interfering ones as interference sources . the path loss between enbs can be used to characterize the strength of the interference .",
    "then each enb measures the path loss of the reference signal received power from its neighboring enbs and chooses @xmath10 interfering enbs reasonably .",
    "the received interference signal power from enb @xmath12 will be    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the distance between enb @xmath4 and enb @xmath12 , @xmath2 is path loss coefficient , and @xmath14 is the path loss . when the propagation environment is identical , @xmath2 is also equal . in homogeneous networks , all enbs transmit power are equivalent , and we can simply determine whether the enbs should be regard as interference sources by the geometrical location",
    ". the ones with shorter distances will be more likely classified as interfering enb .",
    "in heterogeneous network , @xmath13 is different and the interfering enb set will be determined based on @xmath19 and @xmath13 . for different types of enbs ,",
    "the transmit power are known , e.g. macro enbs usually transmit with 46 dbm power , and small cell enbs transmit with 30 dbm or 24 dbm power , etc .    in the scenario of just pico cells ,",
    "the enbs are randomly distributed .",
    "therefore we distinguish the boundary of the interference sources by setting the threshold @xmath20 . when @xmath21 , the ones belong to the strong interference resources and when @xmath22 , we will not consider the impact of these enbs .",
    "after the number of interference sources is determined , their configuration information are sent to the interfered enb .",
    "this information can be sent in two different ways .",
    "a straightforward way is to send a bitmap with 5 bits indicating the link information of fls . if it is dl subframe , 1 is sent , otherwise , 0 will be sent .",
    "take the dl / ul configuration 1 as an example , the bitmap will be 01001 .",
    "another way is to send the dl / ul configuration number .",
    "therefore , totally only 3 bits are needed .",
    "it will send 001 when enb chooses configuration 1 .",
    "when 001 is received , the configuration information ( 01001 ) will be generated .",
    "considering the command burden , this paper chooses the latter one .",
    "each enb chooses corresponding configuration to adapt the small cell traffic periodically .",
    "thus the power control period follows the dl / ul reconfiguration period , e.g. 10ms , 200 , 640ms , etc .      to estimate the interference level",
    "more precisely , a interference level indicator @xmath23 which takes into account all major factors can be defined .",
    "the received signal at interfered enb @xmath4 is written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the received signal at enb @xmath4 , @xmath26denotes the channel only considers the large scale fading between ue @xmath27 and enb @xmath4 , @xmath28 is the ul transmit signal from ue @xmath27 in enb @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of interfering enbs.@xmath29 is one of the five bits which denotes the configuration information of the interfering enb @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath30 is the channel only consider large scale fading between enb @xmath4 and enb @xmath12 and @xmath31 is the transmit signal of enb @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath32 denotes other interference signals .",
    "@xmath33 is the complex gaussian noise signal , and its power is @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath35 assume the ue @xmath27 transmit power is @xmath36 , the enb @xmath12 transmit power is @xmath37 and the path loss between enb @xmath4 and enb @xmath12 is @xmath38 .",
    "also , @xmath32 is not considered .",
    "the above @xmath39 can be rewritten as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the antenna gain of enb @xmath4 , @xmath42 is the antenna gain of enb @xmath12 and @xmath43 is the antenna gain of ue @xmath27 .",
    "the ul capacity in enb @xmath4 is    @xmath44    since the enb - to - enb interference is the major interference , so it is reasonable to assume that @xmath45 after adjust the ue transmit power .",
    "then the capacity can be written as    @xmath46 , \\end { aligned } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath34 are constant and their effects can be neglected . according to the above formula , the path loss @xmath38 and the adjacent enb transmit power @xmath37 are primary influencing factors .",
    "therefore , we propose to define the interference level indicator @xmath23 in fis subframes for enb @xmath4 as below    @xmath47    when the @xmath39 is very low , the interfering signal is a key factor in the enb received signal .",
    "so , @xmath48 , it is also reasonable that the interference level indictor is defined as formula(9 ) .    in the process of the proposed scheme ,",
    "the interfering enbs configuration information is received and the interference level indicator @xmath23 will be calculated . according to the @xmath23 ,",
    "ues adjust the transmission power where @xmath17 follows the rule of table i. when @xmath49 , the max interference level indicator @xmath50 of enb is @xmath51 .",

    "this paper adopts dl / ul packet throughput as the performance metric .",
    "the average packet throughput provides a measure of overall system performance , whereas the 5%-ile packet throughput is used to assess the cell - edge performance .",
    "we assume that the hypothetical value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are listed in table ii .",
    "@xmath52 is set three demarcation points and four regions . when the ue transmit power is adjusted , it is not greater than the maximum value .",
    "if the subframe is fis , the ue transmit power do nt make change .",
    "the dynamic tdd dl / ul reconfiguration period and the power control period are selected as 10 msec .    in the simulation , there are 19 three - sector macro sites and 4 picos are randomly deployed in each sector .",
    "10 ues are uniformly distributed inside each pico cell .",
    "also , the macros are not active and each pico can change tdd dl / ul configuration dynamically .",
    "table iii provides other system level simulation parameters specific to our study .",
    "we use a non - full buffer traffic model to generate traffic in the system .",
    "specifically , we use the ftp traffic mode characterized by poisson distributed arrivals with an arrival rate of @xmath54(for dl arrivals ) , and @xmath55(for ul arrivals ) and adopt a fixed file size of 0.5 mb per packet .",
    "fig.3 and fig.4 show the average dl / ul packet throughput and the 5%-ile packet throughput for the proposed scheme vs. the baseline , respectively . at very low packet arrival rates ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "the experienced interference as well as the probabilities of reconfiguration are extremely low .",
    "this results in low gain of the proposed scheme .",
    "the average ul packet throughput increases less than 2% , meanwhile the cell - edge throughput obtain little improvement .",
    "as the ul packet arrival rate becomes higher , there is an increase in the number of active downloads and/or uploads .",
    "this has the twofold effect :    @xmath0 increasing the experienced interference ;    @xmath0 and allowing for frequent changes in interference for the ul subframes .",
    "the proposed scheme monitors the surrounding interference and sets appropriate @xmath57 . as a result",
    ", we observe that the average ul packet throughput gains over 5% ( @xmath58 ) . and from fig.4 , the remarkable performance gains are observed for low and medium traffic loadings ( @xmath59 ) . as @xmath60 , the interference increases and the cell - edge ues are interfered more seriously .",
    "the 5%-ile packet throughput gains nothing , but the average ul packet throughput still get the gain over 8% .    on the one hand , the ues of higher transmission power",
    "interfere the adjacent edge ues more seriously(ue - to - ue interference ) and result in lower dl packet throughput . on the other hand ,",
    "the ul channel quality will be better and the data packets are transmitted more efficiency .",
    "accordingly , the ul time slot resource is reduced relatively and it is opposite for the dl time slot resource .",
    "this factor will be beneficial to dl packet throughput .",
    "due to the interaction of the two factors , fig.3 shows that the average dl packet throughput has almost no significant changes .",
    "the 5%-ile dl packet throughput becomes lower slightly ( @xmath61 ) from fig.4 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated a closed - loop ul power control scheme to combat the severe enb - to - enb interference that results from independent dynamic tdd dl / ul reconfiguration . in this scenario which just focus on the types of interference in pico cells , we propose an algorithm to estimate the enb - to - enb interference level . from the simulation results",
    ", we can conclude that the significant performance gains can be achieved for the average ul packet throughput . and the 5%-ile packet throughput gains over 9% for medium data traffic .",
    "when the traffic load is higher , the parameters(@xmath62 and @xmath57 ) need to be considered more accurately",
    ". meanwhile , the ue - to - ue interference is not as serious as we expected when the ues increase the transmit power .",
