    "self - gravitating systems such as globular clusters and elliptical galaxies constitute a hamiltonian system of particles in interaction that can be supposed isolated in a first approximation @xcite . since energy is conserved , the proper description of stellar systems is the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",

    "the kinetic theory of globular clusters is based on the landau - poisson system ( or the orbit averaged fokker - planck equation ) which describes a collisional evolution .",

    "they possess a rich physical and mathematical structure and can lead to a situation of `` isothermal collapse '' , which is the canonical version of the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "these equations have not been considered by astrophysicists because the canonical ensemble is not the correct description of stellar systems and usual astrophysical bodies do not experience a friction with a gas ( except dust particles in the solar nebula @xcite ) . yet , it is clear that the self - gravitating brownian gas model is of considerable conceptual interest in statistical mechanics to understand the strange thermodynamics of systems with long - range interactions and the inequivalence of statistical ensembles . in addition , it provides one of the first model of stochastic particles with long - range interactions , thereby extending the classical einstein - smoluchowski model @xcite to a more general context @xcite .",

    "the biological organisms secrete a substance that has an attractive effect on the organisms themselves .",
    "therefore , in addition to their diffusive motion , they move systematically along the gradient of concentration of the chemical they secrete ( chemotactic flux ) .",

    "in particular , the chemotactic flux plays the same role as the gravitational drift in the overdamped limit of the brownian model .",

    "first , our assumption of uniform temperature is certainly not realistic in a system displaying huge density contrast , and some alternative approaches are needed to incorporate a spatially dependent temperature .",
    "this point is certainly crucial and will be addressed in a future work @xcite . furthermore , in this regime , a careful physical analysis predicts that this system of self - gravitating individual particles should lead to the formation of binaries which is probably beyond the description ability of our essentially mean - field approach . in other words ,",
    "the system may become intrinsically heterogeneous , which probably can not be captured by our continuous model .",
    "finally , we can think of other physical effects ( degeneracy effects of quantum or dynamical origin , finite particle size effects , ... ) preventing the system from reaching arbitrarily large densities .",
    "one way to describe such effects consists in introducing a spatial cut - off @xmath239 or a density cut - off of order @xmath298 .",
    "in such a system , the dynamics first follows the pre - collapse dynamics until the maximum density is approached .",
    "then , the system will ultimately reach a maximum entropy state that we propose to characterize in a simple manner , as in @xcite .",
    "we propose to describe the final state as a `` core - halo '' structure , which for simplicity we modelize as a core of radius @xmath299 and constant density @xmath300 which mimics a regularized central dirac peak containing a mass @xmath154 . in the region",
    "@xmath301 stands the halo of constant density @xmath302 containing the rest of the mass . as @xmath239 is small",

    "hence , we find that the mass included in the core slowly _ decreases _ with the core size @xmath239 @xcite , resulting in an effective singularity @xmath310",
    ". meanwhile , the temperature diverges as @xmath311 and leads rapidly and efficiently to a uniform halo .    0.2 cm    in order to relate this result to our actual system",
    ", we perform microcanonical post - collapse simulations using the same regularization scheme as in the canonical case in order to describe the evolution of @xmath106 .",
    "in addition to this , we also need to regularize the potential energy which is strictly infinite ( as well as @xmath1 ) when @xmath312 . consistently with the previous discussion , we introduce a numerical cut - off @xmath239 by defining @xmath313 in fig .  5 , we plot @xmath106 and @xmath15 for different values of the cut - off @xmath239 .",
    "contrary to the canonical case , the post - collapse dynamics is strongly @xmath239 dependent .",

    "( [ n0h ] ) , the central mass @xmath154 clearly decreases as @xmath314 .",
    "therefore , in the microcanonical case , the physical picture is that when the collapse time @xmath21 is reached , the temperature increases rapidly , which leads to the rapid homogenization of the system except for a dense and small core , whose mass @xmath315 is a decreasing function of the maximum temperature reached .",
    "this central structure with weak mass and huge binding energy is similar to a `` binary star '' structure in stellar dynamics .",

    "the system develops a singular density profile scaling as @xmath140 .",
    "however , the `` central singularity contains no mass '' , the temperature does not diverge , and the entropy and free energy are finite @xcite . since this profile is not a maximum entropy ( resp",
    ". minimum free energy ) state nor a stationary solution of the smoluchowski - poisson system , the collapse continues after @xmath21 .",
    "this solves the apparent paradox reported in @xcite .    in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "mass accretes progressively at the center of the system and a dirac peak forms by swallowing the surrounding particles .",
    "eventually , the dirac peak contains all the mass .",
    "this structure has an infinite free energy @xmath316 simply because its binding energy is infinite .",
    "this is therefore the most probable structure in canonical ensemble @xcite . in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the maximum entropy state ( at fixed mass and energy ) consists of a single binary embedded in a hot halo @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what we see in our numerical simulations .",
    "the temperature increases dramatically above @xmath21 ( resulting in an almost uniform halo ) although the mass contained in the core is weak ( but finite ) .",
    "we note the `` spectacular '' fact that almost all the gravitational energy resides in a binary - like core with negligible mass . a similar phenomenon is observed in stellar dynamics for globular clusters having experienced core collapse @xcite .",
    "this shows that the microcanonical smoluchowski - poisson system shares some common properties with kinetic equations usually considered in stellar dynamics ( landau - fokker - planck equations ) , despite its greater simplicity .",
    "clearly , a major drawback of our microcanonical model is to assume that the temperature uniformizes instantaneously , implying an infinite thermal conductivity .",
    "we shall relax this simplification in a future work @xcite . however , the present study is one of the first dynamical study showing the formation of dirac peaks and binary - like structures in systems with gravitational interaction .",
    "our brownian model is based on the existence of a gaseous medium that generates a friction force .",
