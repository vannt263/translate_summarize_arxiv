    "<S> during the last few years deep underwater neutrino telescopes of a new generation with dimensions close to 100 m or more were taken into operation . </S>",
    "<S> for the correct track reconstruction of events and for the interpretation of light pulses from calibration lasers one has to use the group velocity for light signals . the difference between group velocity and the traditionally used phase velocity leads to an additional delay of about 10 ns for a distance of 100 m between light source and photomultiplier . from the time of the appearance of the first projects of deep underwater neutrino telescopes in the middle of 70th </S>",

    "<S> have been taken into operation . </S>",
    "<S> two deep underwater arrays , and antares /4/ , are under construction .    </S>",
    "<S> the cherenkov light from high energy muons , electromagnetic and hadronic showers can be recorded at distances of 20  100 m depending upon the light absorption of water or ice . </S>",
    "<S> impulse laser light sources are widely used in these arrays for calibration . </S>",
    "<S> light pulses from such sources can be recorded over even larger distances .    at such distances , </S>",
    "<S> the difference between group and phase velocity of light in water or ice is essential . </S>",
    "<S> as far as i know , this fact hasnt been mentioned in the literature from the time of the first neutrino telescope projects in the middle of the seventies /5,6/ and hasnt been taken into account for the data analysis and mc calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of light pulses in matter is given by the group velocity /7,8/ : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the frequency , @xmath2 is the wave vector .    </S>",
    "<S> the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be written in the following form ( dispersion equation ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath5 is the refraction index .    </S>",
    "<S> as it is known , refraction indices given in handbooks like /9/ correspond to the phase velocity due to the method they are measured /10/ : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the phase velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to accept a group refraction index for the group velocity similar to the phase index of refraction : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the group velocity .    using ( 2 ) and replacing the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath5 by a wavelength dependence </S>",
    "<S> , the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath5 can be derived :    @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is negative for water over the visible light range , and so @xmath10 is larger than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the wavelength dependence of @xmath5 ( curve 1 ) for destilled water at 20@xmath14c /9/ , and the same for @xmath10 ( curve 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the density of water influences the refraction index at large depths of neutrino telescopes . but </S>",
    "<S> this correction is rather small due to the comparatively small compression coefficient of water . for the conditions of nt-200 ( depth 1100 m , water temperature the variation of the refraction index is about 0.002 only </S>",
    "<S> this is more than 10 times smaller than the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this correction of @xmath5 would reach 0.01 for the arrays to be placed in the ocean depths of 4 -5 km , but even in this case the depth correction is significantly smaller than that due to the difference between group and phase velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the curve 3 on fig.1 shows the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath12 for the conditions of the telescope nt-200 .    </S>",
    "<S> all curves at fig.1 were calculated for destilled water . </S>",
    "<S> the light absorption of natural water differs from that of destilled water , and so there is a difference in the image part of their dielectric penetration . as kramers - kroning equation connects the real part of the dielectric penetration with it s imaginary part /7/ , the real refraction index differs , in principle , from that of destilled water . </S>",
    "<S> such a correction would be non - negligible only if there are the intensive lines of absorption in the visible light absorption spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the dependencies of delays on the distance between light source and receiver which emerge from the difference between the phase and group velocities for different wavelengths .    for arrays with angular resolution 1 - 2@xmath14 replacement of the phase velocity by the group velocity probably would not lead to essential changes in track reconstruction . for the projects which claim an angular accuracy 0.1 - 0.2@xmath14 and absorption length of @xmath15 m /4/ the use of group velocity in track reconstruction procedures seems to be absolutely necessary </S>"
