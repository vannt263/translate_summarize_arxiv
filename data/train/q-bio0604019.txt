    "recurrent neural networks are a prominent model for information processing and memory in the brain . @xcite .",
    "traditionally , these models assume synapses that may change on the time scale of learning , but that can be assumed constant during memory retrieval .",
    "however , synapses are reported to exhibit rapid time variations , and it is likely that this finding has important implications for our understanding of the way information is processed in the brain @xcite .",
    "for instance , hopfield  like networks in which synapses undergo rather generic fluctuations have been shown to significantly improve the associative process , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition , motivated by specific neurobiological observations and their theoretical interpretation @xcite , activity  dependent synaptic changes which induce _ depression _ of the response have been considered @xcite .",
    "it was shown that synaptic depression induces , in addition to memories as stable attractors , special sensitivity of the network to changing stimuli as well as rapid switching of the activity among the stored patterns @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been observed experimentally to occur during the processing of sensory information @xcite .    in this paper , we present and study networks that are inspired in the observation of certain , more complex synaptic changes .",
    "that is , we assume that repeated presynaptic activation induces at short times not only depression but also _ facilitation _ of the postsynaptic potential @xcite .",
    "the question , which has not been quite addressed yet , is how a competition between depression and facilitation will affect the network performance .",
    "we here conclude that , as for the case of only depression @xcite , the system may exhibit up to three different _ phases _ or regimes , namely , one with standard associative memory , a disordered phase in which the network lacks this property , and an oscillatory phase in which activity switches between different memories . depending on the balance between facilitation and depression , novel intriguing behavior results in the oscillatory regime .",
    "in particular , as the degree of facilitation increases , both the sensitivity to external stimuli is enhanced and the frequency of the oscillations increases .",
    "it then follows that facilitation allows for recovering of information with less error , at least during a short interval of time and can therefore play an important role in short  term memory processes .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with a network of binary neurons .",
    "previous studies have shown that the behaviour of such a simple network dynamics agree qualitatively with the behaviour that is observed in more realistic networks , such as integrate and fire neuron models of pyramidal cells  @xcite .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 binary neurons , @xmath1 @xmath2 endowed of a probabilistic dynamics , namely,@xmath3 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{s}\\]]which is controlled by a _ temperature _",
    "parameter , @xmath4 see , for instance , @xcite for details .",
    "the function @xmath5 denotes a time ",
    "dependent _ local field _ ,",
    "i.e. , the total presynaptic current arriving to the postsynaptic neuron @xmath6 this will be determined in the model following the phenomenological description of nonlinear synapses reported in @xcite , which was shown to capture well the experimentally observed properties of neocortical connections .",
    "accordingly , we assume that @xmath7where @xmath8 is a constant threshold associated to the firing of neuron @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions to be determined which describe the effect on the neuron activity of short ",
    "term synaptic depression and facilitation , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the weight @xmath12 of the connection between the ( presynaptic ) neuron @xmath13 and the ( postsynaptic ) neuron @xmath14 are static and _ store _ a set of patterns of the network activity , namely , the familiar _ covariance rule _ : @xmath15here , @xmath16 with @xmath17 are different binary  patterns of average activity @xmath18 .",
    "the standard hopfield model is recovered for @xmath19 , @xmath20    we next implement a dynamics for @xmath21 and @xmath22 after the prescription in @xcite . a description of varying synapses requires ,",
    "at least , three local variables , say @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be associated to the fractions of neurotransmitters in recovered , active , and inactive states , respectively .",
    "a simpler picture consists in dealing with only the @xmath26 variable . this simplification , which seems to describe accurately both interpyramidal and pyramidal interneuron synapses , corresponds to the fact that the time in which the postsynaptic current decays is much shorter than the recovery time for synaptic depression , say @xmath27 @xcite ( time intervals are in milliseconds hereafter ) . within this approach",
    ", one may write that @xmath28where@xmath29and@xmath30the interpretation of this ansatz is as follows .",
    "concerning any presynaptic neuron @xmath31 the product @xmath32 stands for the total fraction of neurotransmitters in the recovered state which are activated either by incoming spikes , @xmath33 or by facilitation mechanisms , @xmath34 for simplicity , we are assuming that @xmath35 $ ] @xmath36 the additional variable @xmath37 is assumed to satisfy , as in the quantal model of transmitter release in @xcite ,",
    "that@xmath38 s_{j}\\left ( t\\right ) ,   \\label{u}\\]]which describes an increase with each presynaptic spike and a decay to the resting value with relaxation time @xmath39 ( that is given in milliseconds ) consequently , facilitation washes out ( @xmath40 ) as @xmath41 and each presynaptic spike uses a fraction @xmath42 of the available resources @xmath43 the effect of facilitation increases with decreasing @xmath44 because this will leave more neurotransmitters available to be activated by facilitation .",
    "therefore , facilitation is not controlled only by @xmath39 but also by @xmath45    the hopfield case with static synapses is recovered after using @xmath46 in eq.([d ] ) and @xmath47 in eq.([f ] ) or , equivalently , @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) and ( [ u ] ) .",
    "in fact , the latter imply fields @xmath49 so that one may simply rescale both @xmath50 and the threshold .    the above interesting phenomenological description of dynamic changes has already been implemented in attractor neural networks @xcite for pure depressing synapses between excitatory pyramidal neurons @xcite .",
    "we are here interested in the consequences of a competition between depression and facilitation .",
    "therefore , we shall use @xmath51 and @xmath39 in the following as relevant control parameters .",

    "because it requires to linearize ( [ dyn ] ) and the dimensionality diverges in the thermodynamical limit ( see however  @xcite ) . in the next section we therefore deal with the case @xmath82",
    "consider a finite number of stored patterns @xmath83 i.e. , @xmath84 in the thermodynamic limit . in practice , it is sufficient to deal with @xmath85 to illustrate the main results ( therefore , we shall suppress the index @xmath54 hereafter ) .",
    "let us define the vectors of order parameters @xmath86 , its stationary value @xmath87 that is given by the solution of eq .",
    "[ steady ] , and @xmath88 whose components are the functions on the right hand side of ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "the stability of ( [ dyn ] ) around the steady state ( [ steady ] ) follows from the first derivative matrix @xmath89 this is @xmath90where @xmath91 @xmath92 \\,x_{\\pm } , $ ] @xmath93 \\,m_{\\pm } , $ ] @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 after noticing that @xmath98 one may numerically diagonalize @xmath99 and obtain the eigenvalues @xmath100 for a given set of control parameters @xmath101 for @xmath102 @xmath103 the system is stable ( unstable ) close to the fixed point @xmath104 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath105 determines the local stability : for @xmath106 the system ( [ dyn ] ) is locally stable , while for @xmath107 there is at least one direction of instability , and the system consequently becomes locally unstable .",
    "therefore , varying the control parameters one crosses the line @xmath108 that signals the bifurcation points .    the resulting situation is summarized in figure [ fig1 ] for specific values of @xmath44 @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "( [ steady ] ) have three solutions , two of which are memory states corresponding to the pattern and anti - pattern and the other a so - called paramagnetic state that has no overlap with the memory pattern .",
    "the stability of the two solutions depends on @xmath111 .",
    "the region @xmath112 corresponds to the non - retrieval phase , where the paramagnetic solution is stable and the memory solutions are unstable . in this phase",
    ", the average network behaviour has no significant overlap with the stored memory pattern .",
    "the region @xmath113 corresponds to the memory phase , where the paramagnetic solution is unstable and the memory solutions are stable .",
    "the network retrieves one of the stored memory patterns . for @xmath114 ( denoted `` o '' in the figure )",
    "none of the solutions is stable .",
    "the activity of the network in this regime keeps moving from one to the other fixed  points neighborhood ( the pattern and anti - pattern in this simple example ) .",
    "this rapid switching behaviour is typical for dynamical synapses and does not occur for static synapses .",
    "a similar oscillatory behavior was reported in @xcite for the case of only synaptic depression .",
    "a main novelty is that the inclusion of facilitation importantly modifies the _ phase diagram _ , as discussed below ( figure [ fig2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the phases for @xmath115 ( f ) and @xmath116 ( p ) correspond , respectively , to a locally  stable regime with associative memory ( @xmath117 ) and to a disordered regime without memory ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) .",
    "the values @xmath119 and @xmath120 which , as a function of @xmath121 @xmath42 and @xmath122 determine the limits of the oscillatory phase correspond to the onset of condition @xmath123 this condition defines lines in the parameter space ( @xmath124 ) that are illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this reveals that @xmath125 ( separation between the f and o regions ) in general decreases with increasing facilitation , which implies a larger oscillatory region and consequently a reduction of the memory phase . on the other hand , @xmath126 ( separation between o and p regions ) in general increases with facilitation , thus broadening further the width of the oscillatory phase @xmath127 the behavior of this quantity under different conditions is illustrated in the insets of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "another interesting consequence of facilitation are the changes in the phase diagram as one varies the facilitation parameter @xmath42 which measures the fraction of neurotransmitter that are not activated by the facilitating mechanism**. * * in order to discuss this , we define the ratio between the time scales , @xmath128 and monitor the phase diagram ( @xmath129 ) for varying @xmath130 the result is also in figure [ fig2 ] see the bottom graphs for @xmath131 ( left ) and @xmath132 ( right ) which correspond , respectively , to a situation in which depression and facilitation occur in the same time scale and to a situation in which facilitation is four times faster .",
    "the two cases exhibit a similar behavior for large @xmath44 but they are qualitatively different for small @xmath45 in the case of faster facilitation , there is a range of @xmath42 values for which @xmath133 increases , in such a way that one passes from the oscillatory to the memory phase by slightly increasing @xmath45 this means that facilitation tries to drive the network activity to one of the attractors ( @xmath134 ) and , for weak depression ( @xmath42 small ) , the activity will remain there .",
    "decreasing @xmath42 further has then the effect of increasing effectively the system temperature , which destabilizes the attractor .",
    "this only requires small @xmath42 because the dynamics ( [ u ] ) rapidly decreases the second term in @xmath21 to zero .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the variation with both @xmath27 and @xmath135 of the stationary locally ",
    "stable solution with associative memory , @xmath117 , computed this time both in the mean field approximation and using monte carlo simulation .",
    "this monte carlo simulation consists of iterating eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) , ( [ x ] ) and ( [ u ] ) using parallel dynamics .",
    "this shows a perfect agreement between our mean ",
    "field approach above and monte carlo simulations as long as one is far from the transition , a fact which is confirmed below ( in figure [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "this is because , near @xmath136 the simulations describe hops between positive and negative @xmath137 which do not compare well with the mean  field absolute value @xmath138    the most interesting behavior is perhaps the one revealed by the phase diagram @xmath139 in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "here we depict a case with @xmath140 in order to clearly visualize the effect of facilitation facilitation has practically no effect for any @xmath141 as shown above and @xmath142ms in order to compare with the situation of only depression in @xcite .",
    "a main result here is that , for appropriate values of the working temperature @xmath109 , one may force the system to undergo different types of transitions by simply varying @xmath143 first note , that the line @xmath144 corresponds roughly to the case of static synapses , since @xmath111 is very small . in this limit",
    "the transition between retrieval ( f ) and non - retrieval ( p ) phases is at @xmath145 at low enough @xmath122 there is transition between the non  retrieval ( p ) and retrieval phases ( f ) as facilitation is increased .",
    "this reveals a positive effect of facilitation on memory at low temperature , and suggests improvement of the network storage capacity which is usually measured at @xmath146 a prediction that we have confirmed in preliminary simulations . at intermediate temperatures , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath147 for @xmath140 the systems shows no memory in the absence of facilitation , but increasing @xmath148 one may describe consecutive transitions to a retrieval phase ( f ) , to a disordered phase ( p ) , and then to an oscillatory phase ( o ) .",
    "the latter is associated to a new instability induced by a strong depression effect due to the further increase of facilitation . at higher @xmath122 facilitation",
    "may drive the system directly from complete disorder to an oscillatory regime .",
    "in addition to its influence on the onset and width of the oscillatory region , @xmath149 determines the frequency of the oscillations of @xmath150 in order to study this effect , we computed the average time between consecutive minimum and maximum of these oscillations , i.e. , a half period .",
    "the result is illustrated in the left graph of figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "this shows that the frequency of the oscillations increases with the facilitation time .",
    "this means that the access of the network activity to the attractors is faster with increasing facilitation , though",
    "the system then remains a shorter time near each attractor due to an stronger depression .",
    "on the other hand , we also computed the maximum of @xmath137 during oscillations , namely , @xmath151 this , which is depicted in the right graph of figure [ figure5 ] , also increases with @xmath152 the overall conclusion is that not only the access to the stored information is faster under facilitation but that increasing facilitation will also help to retrieve information with less error .    in order to deepen further on some aspects of the system behavior",
    ", we present in figures [ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] a detailed study of specific time series .",
    "the middle graph in figure [ figure6 ] corresponds to a simulation of the system evolution for increasing values of @xmath153 as one describes the horizontal line for @xmath154 in figure figure4 .",
    "the system thus visits consecutively the different regions ( separated by vertical lines ) as time goes on .",
    "that is , the simulation starts with the system in the stable _ paramagnetic _ phase , denoted p1 in the figure , and then successively moves by varying @xmath149 into the stable _ ferromagnetic _ phase f , into another paramagnetic phase , p2 , and , finally , into the oscillatory phase o.    we interpret that the observed behavior in p2 is due to competition between the facilitation mechanism , which tries to bring the system to the fixed  point attractors , and the depression mechanism , which tends to desestabilize the attractors .",
    "the result is a sort of intermittent behavior in which oscillations and convergence to a fixed point alternates , in a way which resembles ( but is not ) chaos .",
    "the top graph in figure [ figure6 ] , which corresponds to an average over independent runs , illustrates the typical behaviour of the system in these simulations ; the middle run depicts an individual run .",
    "further interesting behavior is shown in the bottom graph of figure figure6 .",
    "this corresponds to an individual run in the presence of a very small and irregular external stimulus which is represented by the ( green ) line around @xmath155 this consist of an irregular series of positive and negative pulses of intensity @xmath156 and duration of 20 ms .",
    "in addition to a great sensibility to weak inputs from the environment , this reveals that increasing facilitation tends to significantly enhance the system response .",
    "figure [ figure7 ] shows the power spectra of typical time series such as the ones in figure [ figure6 ] , namely , describing the horizontal line for @xmath154 in figure [ figure4 ] to visit the different regimes .",
    "we plot here time series @xmath157 obtained , respectively , for @xmath158 20 , 50 and 100 and , on top of each of them , the corresponding spectra .",
    "this reveals a flat , white  noise spectra for the p1 phase and also for the stable fixed ",
    "point solution in the f regime .",
    "however , the case for the intermittent p2 phase depicts a small peak around 65 hz .",
    "the peak is much sharper and it occurs at 70 hz in the oscillatory case .",
    "we have shown that the dynamical properties of synapses have profound consequences on the behaviour , and the possible functional role , of recurrent neural networks . depending on the relative strength of the depression , the facilitation and the noise in the network , one observes attractor dynamics to one of the stored patterns , non - retrieval where the neurons fire largely at random in a fashion that is uncorrelated to the stored memory patterns , or switching where none of the stored patterns is stable and the network switches rapidly between ( the neighborhoods of ) all of them .",
    "these three behaviours were also observed in our previous work where we studied the role of depression .",
    "the particular role of facilitation is the following .",
    "the transitions between these possible phases are controlled by two facilitation parameters , namely , @xmath159 and @xmath45 analysis of the oscillatory phase reveals that the frequency of the oscillations , as well as the maximum retrieval during oscillations increase when the degree of facilitation increases .",
    "that is , facilitation favours in the model a faster access to the stored information with a noticeably smaller error .",
    "this suggests that synaptic facilitation might have an important role in short",
    " term memory processes",
    ".    there is increasing evidence in the literature that similar jumping processes could be at the origin of the animals ability to adapt and rapidly response to the continuously changing stimuli in their environment .",
    "we therefore believe that the network behaviour that is the consequence of dynamic synapses as presented in this paper may have important functional implications .",
