    "on february 23 , 1987 , supernova 1987a ( sn  1987a ) , the brightest supernova since kepler s sn in 1604 , exploded in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "about ten years thereafter , the energy output from the supernova became dominated by the interaction of its blast wave with the inner equatorial ring ( er ) , a dense ring of gas located at a distance of about 0.7 lyr from the center of the explosion , believed to be produced by mass loss from the progenitor star .",
    "the er is being repeatedly observed at optical wavelengths with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xcite , at x - ray energies with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite , at radio frequencies with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) @xcite , and in the mid - ir with the gemini south observatory @xcite and the _ spitzer _ observatory @xcite .",
    "the morphological changes in its appearance in these different wavelength regimes ( presented in figure 6 of mccray 2007 ) reveal the progressive interaction of the sn blast wave with the er . the interaction regions appear as hot spots in the _ hst _ images , representing the shocked regions of finger - like protrusions that were generated by rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the interaction of the wind from the progenitor star with the er ( see figure 2 in mccray 2007 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is thermal emission from the very hot plasma , and consists of two main characteristic components : a hard ( @xmath9  kev ) component representing a fast shock propagating into a low density medium , and a soft ( @xmath10  kev ) component representing a decelerated shock propagating into the denser protrusions @xcite .",
    "the optical emission arises from the gas that is shocked by the blast wave transmitted through the dense protrusions in the er @xcite , and the radio emission is synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir emission spectrum is comprised of line and continuum emission .",
    "the lines most probably originate from the optically bright dense knots .",
    "the continuum that dominates the spectrum is thermal emission from dust that was formed in the post main sequence wind of the progenitor star before it exploded .",
    "this dust could either be located in the shocked x - ray emitting plasma and heated by electronic collisions or in the optical knots and radiatively heated by the shocks giving rise to the optical emission @xcite .",
    "dust has also formed in the ejecta of the supernova about 530 days after the explosion , as evidenced by optical and ir observations of sn1987a @xcite , but its current contribution to the total mid - ir emission is negligible @xcite .    because the gemini 11.7  @xmath0 m  image correlates well with both the x - ray and optical emission , the possibility that the dust is radiatively heated in the knots was considered in detail by @xcite .",
    "estimated dust temperatures of @xmath11  k fell short of the observed value of @xmath12  k but given the uncertainties in the model parameters , this discrepancy could not firmly rule out this possible scenario for the location and heating mechanism of the dust",
    ". however , the combined ir and x - ray observations can be more readily explained if the dust resides in the shocked regions of the finger - like protrusions that give rise to the observed soft x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "we will adopt this scenario as our working hypothesis , and derive a self - consistent model for the composition , abundance , and size distribution of the dust to explain the evolutionary changes in the ir and x - ray fluxes resulting from the collisional heating and the destruction of the dust grains by the ambient plasma .",
    "we first review the basic physical principles that determine the temperature of collisionally heated dust , and describe how the ir emission can be used to probe the physical condition of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "we also discuss what information can be derived from the comparison of the ir and x - ray fluxes from the gas (  2.1 ) .",
    "the physics of dust particles in a hot gas is discussed in more detail by dwek ( 1987 ) and dwek & arendt ( 1992 ) . in ",
    "3 we present a simple analytical model for the evolution of the grain size distribution and total dust mass in the gas that is swept up by an expanding sn blast wave . in ",
    "4 we present _ spitzer _ low resolution @xmath13  @xmath0 m  irs spectra obtained on days 6190 and 7137 after the explosion .",
    "the ir spectra are used to derive the temperature and composition of the shock heated dust .",
    "we use ir and x - ray observations of the sn to constrain the grain size distribution and the time at which the sn blast wave first crashed into its dusty surroundings .",
    "the results of our paper are summarized in  5 .",
    "the morphological similarity between the x - ray and mid - ir images of sn  1987a suggests that the ir emission arises from dust that is collisionally heated by the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "simple arguments presented below show that , under certain conditions , the ir luminosity and spectrum of a dusty plasma can be used as a diagnostic for the physical conditions of the gas and the details of the gas - grain interactions . details of the arguments can be found in @xcite and @xcite .      the collisional heating rate , @xmath14(erg  s@xmath15 ) , of a dust grain of radius @xmath16 embedded in a hot plasma is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number density of the @xmath19-th plasma constituent , @xmath20 , its thermal velocity , and @xmath21 its thermally - averaged energy deposition in the dust . in",
    "all the following , we will assume that the ion and electron temperatures are equal .",
    "then @xmath22 , and the dust heating rate is dominated by electronic collisions .",
    "let @xmath23 be the thermally - averaged energy deposited by electrons in the solid .",
    "if most electrons are stopped in the dust then @xmath23 is , on average , equal to the thermal energy of the electrons , that is , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "if most incident electrons go entirely through the grains , then @xmath23 is proportional to the electron stopping power in the solid , defined as @xmath26 . at the energies of interest here the electronic stopping power has an energy dependence of @xmath27 @xcite , or @xmath28 so that @xmath29 .",
    "the functional dependence of the grain heating rate on gas density and temperature is then given by : @xmath30 where we used the fact that @xmath31 .",
    "the radiative cooling rate , @xmath32(erg  s@xmath15 ) , of the dust grain with temperature @xmath33 by ir emission is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath36 is the planck - averaged value of the dust emissivity , @xmath37 , where the value of emissivity index , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 .    in equilibrium , @xmath40 , and the dust temperature dependence on plasma density and temperature can be written as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "these simple arguments show that when the gas temperature is sufficiently high , and the grain size sufficiently small so that most electrons go through the grain , the dust temperature depends only on the plasma density .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     if grains were not destroyed , we would expect the ir intensity to increase by a similar factor . _",
    "the smaller increase in the ir flux , that is , the decline in @xmath4 , is a strong indicator that we are for the first time witnessing the actual destruction of dust in a shock on a dynamical timescale !",
    "_ if the dust composition and size distribution is uniform throughout the region of the er that has been swept up by the shock , then @xmath4  is directly proportional to the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath43 , or to @xmath44 , the ratio between the actual mass of dust in the shocked gas , and the dust mass if grains were not destroyed . the magnitude of the decrease in @xmath4  between the two epochs is strongly determined by the following factors : ( 1 ) the grain size distribution in the preshocked gas of the er ; ( 2 ) the density of the x - ray emitting gas and the grain destruction efficiency , which determine the _ rate _ of grain destruction ; and ( 3 ) the total time the dust is exposed to the flux of ions , which is determined by the time the sn blast wave first crashed into the er . the latter factor determines the _ total _ mass of dust that is returned to the gas .",
    "the dependence of the evolution of @xmath4  on the grain size distribution is somewhat subtle .",
    "if the preshocked grain sizes are too large , then the fractional mass of the dust that could be destroyed during the time interval of 947 days will be too small to account for the observed decrease in the value of @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , if the grain sizes were too small , most of the dust mass would be destroyed , giving rise to a significantly larger than observed decrease in @xmath4  between the two epochs . the right combination of grain sizes , gas density , and ion exposure time is therefore required to produce the observed dust temperature and decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ irx02 ] depicts the evolution in the @xmath45 ratio as a function of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the time , since the explosion , when the sn blast wave first crashed into the dense material of the er , taken here to be the independent variable . the times @xmath48  d and @xmath49  d correspond to the two epochs of near - simultaneous _",
    "spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations of the er . the @xmath45 ratio is derived by taking the the ratio of the fraction of the surviving dust mass , @xmath44 , at the epochs @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see figure [ mdust02 ] ) .",
    "implicit in the figure is a conversion from the dimensionless time variable @xmath52 to absolute time .",
    "the observed @xmath45 ratio is @xmath53 ( see table 1 ) , and shown as a horizontal dashed line in the figure .",
    "the grain size distribution used in the calculations is characterized by a @xmath54 power law in grain radii , extending from a minimum grain size of 10    to a value of @xmath55 of 0.01 , 0.04 , and 0.1  @xmath0 m .",
    "results are presented for a sn blast wave expanding into a one dimensional protrusion ( @xmath56 , left column ) and a uniform medium ( @xmath57 , right column ) with densities of @xmath58  @xmath8  ( top row ) and @xmath59  @xmath8  ( bottom row ) .",
    "the red line in the two bottom figures correspond to calculations performed for the grain size distribution of the er with \\{@xmath60 } = \\{0.023 , 0.22 }  @xmath0 m .",
    "the figure shows that the @xmath45 ratio attains its lowest value when @xmath51 is small , that is , when the first encounter of the er with the sn blast wave occured just before @xmath61 , the first epoch of _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "since @xmath61 is very close to @xmath47 , very little grain destruction could have taken place during the @xmath51 epoch .",
    "the value of @xmath4@xmath62 is therefore close to its pre - shock value .",
    "consequently , any subsequent destruction would lead to relatively great changes in @xmath4  at @xmath63 .",
    "conversely , @xmath45 attains its largest value when @xmath64 ( a physical impossibility because of the finite time required for the sn blast wave to reach the er ) .",
    "then , the relative change in @xmath4  between the two epochs will be the smallest , and @xmath65 . to illustrate the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of @xmath4  values",
    "the curves were drawn for @xmath51 values beyond the maximum physical value of 6137  d.    figure [ irx02 ] also shows the implicit dependence of the @xmath45 ratio on the grain destruction rate .",
    "when @xmath66 is small compared to the time scale of blast wave - er interaction , the grain size distribution relaxes to its equilibrium form , and the curves of @xmath45 for the different grain size distributions converge to the same functional form at sufficiently large values of @xmath51 .",
    "this is especially evident in the lower two figures , for which the gas density is higher , and grain destruction time scales are lower . at @xmath67",
    "d the curves of @xmath45 for the different size distributions have all converged to the same functional form .",
    "the figure shows that the value of @xmath51 ranges from @xmath68  d , for @xmath69 , giving values of @xmath70  d for @xmath56 .",
    "the range of values for @xmath47 is consistent with the uncertainties in the time of the blast wave encounter with the ring .",
    "this suggests that the grain size distribution derived from the x - ray constraint on the ionization timescale , the range of plasma densities , and the grain destruction efficiency used in the model are all consistent with the observed evolution of @xmath4 , and estimated epoch of the first interaction of the blast wave with the er .    the problem can also be reversed to determine the grain destruction efficiency by thermal sputtering , by adopting the epoch of @xmath71  d and the nominal value of @xmath72 as accurate descriptions of the encounter time and the rate of decrease in @xmath4  in the 6190 to 7137 time interval .",
    "the the value of @xmath66 needs then to be adjusted to move the intercept from the calculated value of @xmath73  d to the desired value of @xmath74  d. this will require an increase in @xmath66 by a factor of 2 , or a _ decrease _ in the destruction rate of the silicate grains by a factor of @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the dust properties derived for the er with those derived for the progenitor s circumstellar environment from studies of the evolution and intensity of light echoes created by the scattering of the optical light from the supernova by the dust grains . at any given time , all points with equal delay time lie on an ellipsoid of revolution with the sn at one focal point and the observer at the other .",
    "unfortunately , the ellipsoid at the earliest epoch at which the echoes were observed was outside the er [ see figure 11 in @xcite ] . as a result",
    ", the light echoes probed only the circumstellar and interstellar media exterior to the er .    assuming cylindrical and reflection symmetry , @xcite derived a model for the morphology of the scattering medium consisting of : ( 1 ) a peanut - shaped contact discontinuity ( cd ) between the red supergiant and main- sequence winds from the progenitor star ; ( 2 ) a structure called napoleon s hat ( nh ) constituting the waist of this peanut ; and ( 3 ) the two outer rings of the circumstellar shell ( cs ) that define the hourglass that is pinched by the er . to model",
    "the scattered light @xcite used the @xcite model for interstellar lmc dust with grain radii ranging from an upper limit of 0.2 - 2.0  @xmath0 m  to a lower limit of 0.00035  @xmath0 m . by varying the relative silicate - to - carbon dust mass ratio while maintaining an lmc dust - to - gas mass ratio that is 0.3 times the value of the local interstellar medium , they estimated a total nebular mass of 1.7  @xmath2 .",
    "they also found that the gas density increases , the maximum grain size decreases , and the silicate - to - carbon dust mass ratio increases as the echo samples material that is closer to the sn .",
    "the er , with its population of smaller pure silicate grains , is consistent with this trend .",
    "the higher value of the minimum grain size in the er may be the result of its proximity to the sn which caused the evaporation of grains smaller than 0.02  @xmath0 m  by the initial uv flash .",
    "finally , the dust abundance in the er is consistent with that adopted by @xcite for the nebula , supporting their derived value for the nebular mass .",
    "the interaction of the sn  1987a blast wave with the complex structure of the er has given rise to rapid evolutionary changes in the x - ray , optical and mid - ir morphology of the emission .",
    "the gemini south mid - ir images have established that the ir emission originates from dust in the er that is swept up by the sn blast wave , and collisionaly heated by a soft x - ray component which has a temperature of @xmath75  k , and an ionization timescale of @xmath76  @xmath8  d. the _ spitzer _  infrared observations provide important complementary information on the evolution of the interaction of the sn blast wave with the er and the properties of the dust in the hot x - ray emitting gas . the results of our analysis are as follows :    1 .   _",
    "spitzer _ spectral observations on day 6190 after the explosion revealed that the dust consists of silicate dust grains radiating at an equilibrium temperature of @xmath3  k. subsequent observations on day 7137 revealed that the ir flux increased by a factor of @xmath5 , with the same dust composition and temperature remaining the same ( figure [ specvol ] ) .",
    "2 .   the narrow range of grain temperatures constrains the range of grain sizes and the combinations of plasma temperature and densities capable of heated the dust to the observed range of temperatures . using the x - ray constraint on the ionization timescale we limit the grain size distribution in the preshocked gas to be between 0.023 and 0.22  @xmath0 m .",
    "the grain size distribution may have originally extended to smaller radii , but if so , these grains were evaporated by the initial uv flash from the sn .",
    "3 .   the observed value of @xmath4 , the ir - to - x - ray flux ratio is consistent with that expected from a dusty plasma with lmc abundances of heavy elements . 4 .   the value of @xmath4  decreased by a factor of @xmath53 between days 6190 and 7137 , suggesting that we are witnessing the effects of grain destruction on a dynamical timescale of the remnant .",
    "the magnitude of the decrease in @xmath4  between the two epochs is strongly determined by the following factors : the grain size distribution in the preshocked gas of the er ; the density of the x - ray emitting gas and the grain destruction efficiency ; and the total time the dust is exposed to the flux of sputtering ions .",
    "5 .   to follow the evolution of @xmath4",
    ", we constructed a model for the evolution of the grain size distribution in the shocked gas . in the model , pristine dust",
    "is continuously injected into the hot gas by the expanding sn blast wave , and destroyed by thermal and kinetic sputtering behind the shock .",
    "the evolution of the grain size distribution resulting from the combined effect of dust injection and destruction is presented in figure [ ndust02 ] for different geometries of the medium into which the blast wave is expanding . 6 .",
    "the evolution in @xmath4  represents the changes in the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the shocked gas resulting from grain destruction ( see figures [ mdust02 ] and [ irx02 ] ) . given the grain size distribution and plasma density , the decrease in @xmath4  between two epochs can be used to determine the epoch at which the dust was first swept up by the sn blast wave .",
    "conversely , knowledge of the epoch at which the sn blast wave first encounters the er can be used to determine the grain destruction efficiency in the hot gas .",
    "a self - consistent picture that emerges from the application of the model to the combined x - ray and ir observations is that of a sn blast wave expanding into a dusty finger - like protrusion of the er with a typical lmc dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "the dust in the preshocked gas consists of pure silicate dust with a normal lmc dust - to - gas mass ratio and a grain size distribution limited to radii between @xmath77 0.023 and 0.22  @xmath0 m , sufficiently large to stop the incident electrons .",
    "smaller grain sizes may have formed in the mass outflow from the progenitor star but were probably vaporized by the initial uv flash from the sn .",
    "the sn blast wave crashed into the er between days 4000 and 6000 after the explosion giving rise to the observed soft x - ray emission .",
    "typical temperatures and densities of the soft x - ray emitting gas are @xmath78  k and @xmath7  @xmath8 , consistent with those required to collisionally heat the dust to a temperature of @xmath3  k. the plasma parameters and grain size distribution are consistent with the amount of grain destruction needed to account for the observed decrease in the @xmath4 flux ratio between days 6190 and 7137 . at these gas densities ,",
    "the onset of grain destruction occurred about 1200  2000 days before the first _",

    "observations , consistent with the rise in the soft x - ray flux and the ionization time derived from x - ray models .",
