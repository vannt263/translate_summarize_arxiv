    "the st7 project is designed to demonstrate that test masses can be contained within a spacecraft , and left free from external disturbances at a level approximately 10 times higher than the nominal requirement for lisa  @xcite .",
    "the st7 electrostatic system that contains , senses , and controls the test masses is designed to apply forces no larger than those that would lead to this displacement noise level , and the interferometer is designed to verify the absence of imposed force noise .",
    "dual homodyne michelson interferometers ( figure  [ diag ] ) sense changes in the positions of the test masses . centered on a common optical bench , there is one interferometer for each mass .",
    "the quantity of interest is @xmath1 , the separation of test masses , which is equal to the sum of the two interferometer displacement outputs .",
    "the signal @xmath2 is the total detected intensity for one interferometer ; at the nominal operating point , @xmath2 is half its maximum .",
    "changes in position of one of the test masses are detected as changes in the corresponding @xmath3    fluctuation in the orientation @xmath4 of the test mass is a source of error in the displacement readout .",
    "the signal @xmath5 is the difference in intensity between two halves of the beam , as monitored by segmented photodiodes . @xmath5",
    "measures @xmath4 ; it can be used to reduce the error either during data analysis , or in real - time by serving as the error - point in a control system .    as depicted in figure  [ diag ] , light a 1.06@xmath6 m wavelength npro laser enters on an optical fiber , and is collimated and converted to a free - space beam of approximately 1 mm diameter .",
    "the beam is split to feed two separate interferometers .",
    "the sum of the reference lengths ( drawn vertically ) is matched to the sum of the measurement lengths ( drawn horizontally ) , to make the measurement of @xmath1 insensitive to laser frequency . during data analysis , @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath5 are divided by the laser intensity monitor signal picked off before the interferometer , to form signals independent of the laser intensity .",
    "this homodyne detection scheme has the advantage of simplicity : laser light is injected by a single fiber , there are no polarizers or modulators , and the displacement measurement is derived directly from the detected intensity .",
    "it requires that the masses be constrained to near the mid - fringe position , and that the detection electronics have low noise in the signal band of 1mhz to 1hz .",
    "calculations and measurements indicate that noise in the laser intensity and frequency and in the readout electronics are all sufficiently small to meet the st7 performance requirements . a potential source of significant noise is fluctuation in @xmath4 giving a false reading of noise in @xmath7 we emphasize in this paper the mitigation of test mass orientation noise as sensed by the quadrant photodetectors .    ]",
    "the intensity profile across the interfering beams at the photodetectors is determined by the addition of electric fields , @xmath8 from the reference mirror and @xmath9 from the test mass .",

    "the peak at 20mhz is due to intentional sinusoidal modulation of @xmath71 to verify calibration and to measure the difference in the two interferometers responses .",

    "the observed sensitivity of the sum signal to @xmath4 , @xmath78 also agrees qualitatively with the predicted @xmath11-dependence .",
    "equation  [ intens - sum - deriv ] says that @xmath78 should be maximum at the half - fringe , and the observed maxima are near the half - fringe points .",
    "figure  [ ramp - mid ] shows that when the beam is centered ( @xmath79 ) , the difference response @xmath77 is much larger than the sum response @xmath78 .",
