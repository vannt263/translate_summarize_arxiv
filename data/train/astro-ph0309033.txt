    "the current consensus is that the explosive release of magnetic energy by virtue of magnetic reconnection in the corona is responsible for the observed solar flares .",
    "reconnecting current sheets in the solar corona are believed to form and evolve on the scale of days and weeks , allowing the free magnetic energy in the corona to be accumulated in the sheet .",
    "eventually the sheet is disrupted by an instability , leading to the flare energy release on the scale of minutes and hours .",
    "a well - known difficulty in the flare theory is the so - called trigger problem , which relates to the fact that a relatively slow evolution of the sheet , described by ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , is followed by rapid destabilization when resistive effects in the sheet become important .",
    "the kelvin  helmholtz ( kh ) and tearing instabilities are typically invoked to interpret the transition to the latter stage of the evolution .    given possible applications to the problem of current sheet evolution and disruption in the solar corona , it is interesting to determine whether the standard results on the kh and tearing instabilities are robust with respect to the influence of the reconnection flow in the sheet and the global geometry of the reconnection solution .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present work .",
    "a weakness of most previous analyses of the current sheet instabilities is that they assumed an initial unperturbed state that was not a solution to the resistive steady mhd equations .",
    "previous studies typically assumed a `` quasi - equilibrium '' one - dimensional @xmath0-like profile of magnetic field either with zero velocity @xcite or with a one - dimensional velocity proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "effects of the plasma flow and the resistive diffusion were not exactly balanced for these initial conditions unless a nonuniform electric resistivity in the sheet was postulated . left alone , such current sheet would resistively decay .",
    "one might also argue that heuristic one - dimensional models for the unperturbed magnetic and velocity field could only describe the immediate vicinity of the current sheet rather than a global mhd solution for magnetic reconnection .",
    "we are aware of one work in which the unperturbed state is an exact solution of mhd equations with a uniform and constant electric resistivity : investigated linear stability against tearing mode of a one - dimensional current sheet supported by a stagnation - point flow in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field vector .    in this paper , we use mhd simulations to examine the stability of a reconnecting current sheet described by an exact two - dimensional solution for magnetic reconnection . the craig ",
    "henton solution provides analytical description of flux pile - up magnetic reconnection in incompressible plasma of arbitrary uniform electric resistivity .",
    "the resistive diffusion is exactly balanced by a sheared stagnation - point flow , so that steady - state mhd equations are satisfied globally .",
    "notably , we limit consideration to two - dimensional instabilities of the craig  henton solution , although previous studies indicated that three - dimensional ideal instabilities of two - dimensional current sheets can grow much faster than any two - dimensional instabilities .",
    "recall that flux pile - up current sheets have been repeatedly studied and generalized not only in two but also in three dimensions .",
    "it is understood that both the craig  henton solution and those considered by and are particular cases of a general family of solutions for flux pile - up merging and reconnection .",
    "the analytical nature of the solutions made it possible to demonstrate explicitly many of the characteristics of magnetic reconnection , such as the appearance of small length scales defined by resistivity , magnetic sling shots , and alfvnic outflows .",
    "it is worth stressing that , although the pile - up reconnection solution is locally equivalent to the sweet  parker current sheet as far as reconnection scalings with resistivity are concerned , the two models are not identical globally .",
    "the sweet ",
    "parker model postulates a uniform advection region outside the current sheet , whereas the craig ",
    "henton solution explicitly describes the magnetic field amplification caused by the non - uniform velocity field outside the sheet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the steady - state flux pile - up reconnection solutions in two dimensions and identify two types of the solutions depending on the sign of a plasma velocity component at the boundary . in section 3 , we present the numerical methods for examining the stability of the solutions and describe the numerical results .",
    "we compare the results with predictions of the linear theory of the kh and tearing instabilities , discuss the limitations of the local approach and suggest possible solar applications in section 4 .",
    "we summarize in section 5 .",
    "we begin by reviewing the craig  henton solution that satisfies the steady - state equations of incompressible non - viscous resistive mhd in a planar geometry . using the poisson bracket @xmath1\\equiv\\psi_x\\phi_y-\\psi_y\\phi_x$ ]",
    ", the non - dimensionalized basic equations can be written as @xmath2=[\\nabla^2\\psi,\\psi ] , \\\\ & & e+[\\psi,\\phi]=\\eta\\nabla^2\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , a flux function for the magnetic field @xmath5 and a stream function for the velocity field @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is specified by two dimensionless parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the uniform electric field @xmath7 , normalized by @xmath9 ( in electromagnetic units ) , characterizes the reconnection rate .",
    "the inverse lundquist number @xmath10 is based on a uniform magnetic diffusivity @xmath11 .",
    "here and in what follows , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the reference values of the magnetic field , plasma density , and spatial length scale , @xmath15 is the reference alfvn speed .",
    "an exact reconnection solution satisfying the equations above is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dawson function , and the dimensionless parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 define , respectively , the amplitude and the shear of the velocity field .",
    "these parameters are used to define @xmath20 according to @xmath21 clearly @xmath18 and @xmath19 should satisfy @xmath22 for the physically interesting case of a localized current sheet , in which case the sheet thickness scales as @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution of plasma pressure , @xmath24 is derived from the original momentum equation @xmath25 assuming a constant base pressure @xmath26 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : bsol ] ) and ( [ eq : vsol ] ) demonstrate that both the magnetic field and the velocity field have a stagnation - flow component proportional to @xmath27 , and a shear - flow component proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "the shear width scales as @xmath23 .",
    "assuming that @xmath29 , the solutions are categorized into two groups according to the flow direction along the @xmath30-axis at the external boundary : the outflow solutions with @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the inflow solutions with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the outflow solution",
    "the flux pile - up is accomplished mainly by the advection of the @xmath30-component of magnetic field by the flow parallel to the @xmath35-axis . in the inflow solution",
    "@xmath36 corresponds to the anti - parallel merging with stagnation flow , and @xmath37 describes the fully two - dimensional solution for flux pile - up reconnection , which is also called `` reconnective annihilation '' .",
    "viscous effects , ignored in the solution above and hence throughout this paper , are likely to be important in the region of high shear coinciding with the current sheet .",
    "this is potentially more important for the outflow solution that is characterized by a strong velocity shear .",
    "the craig  henton formalism has been generalized to include viscosity by . the latter solution is more complex mathematically .",
    "this is why in this paper we concentrate on a simpler non - viscous case in which a simple analytical expression for the initial state is available .",
    "although viscosity effects are neglected without much justification in the outflow case , we wish to stress from the outset that the neglect is justified much better in the inflow case when the flow is only weakly sheared . as we show in section 4.4",
    ", it is the inflow case that is of primary interest to us in the solar flare context .",
    "the inflow solution can be tearing unstable , which may explain flare energy release by tearing - induced reconnection .",
    "typical solutions in the outflow case and the inflow case are shown in figure [ fig01 ] . as noted in the previous section ,",
    "a shear of width @xmath38 is present along the @xmath35-axis in both the magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "therefore , we can expect that these solutions can be subject to the kh instability and the tearing instability .",
    "we investigated the stability of the solutions using mhd numerical simulations .",
    "specifically we adopted the analytical exact solution as the initial condition , perturbed it slightly , and examined the time development of the system .",
    "the basic equations for the numerical simulations are _ compressible _ resistive mhd equations in the following dimensionless form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the plasma density and @xmath41 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the above equations are normalized in the same way as those in and in the previous section , using the reference values of length @xmath14 , density @xmath13 , and alfvn speed @xmath42 .",
    "the time is normalized with the global alfvn time @xmath43 .    to simulate the craig ",
    "henton solutions derived for _ incompressible _ flow , we set the constant base pressure @xmath26 in equation ( [ eq : psol ] ) large enough so that the sound speed is at least ten times greater than both the fluid speed and the alfvn speed .",
    "this ensures that the compressible fluid behaves almost as the incompressible one .",
    "the numerical scheme used in the simulations is based on an upwind scheme with roe s numerical fluxes @xcite .",
    "second - order accuracy both in space and time is accomplished by variable extrapolation of monotone upstream - centered schemes for conservation laws ( muscl ) and multi - step time integration , guaranteeing total variation diminishing ( tvd ) with a non - linear limiter function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "constraint transport ( ct ) scheme is combined with the above scheme to develop the magnetic field , ensuring @xmath44 .",
    "the simulation box is set to @xmath45 , and @xmath46 constant grids are assigned .",
    "this resolution is determined so that at least ten grids are assigned in the current sheet thickness .",
    "the analytical solutions of are adopted as the initial conditions for the velocity , magnetic field , and pressure .",
    "the initial dimensionless density is set to unity : @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , a small random velocity perturbation ( 1% of the typical alfvn velocity @xmath48 ) is added in the region of @xmath49 .",
    "the inverse lundquist number is uniform and constant : @xmath50 .",
    "the boundary values are fixed to the initial values for the whole simulation time .",
    "the base dimensionless pressure @xmath26 is fixed at @xmath51 in all cases .",
    "the simulations are performed with the fixed courant number of 0.8 , and the corresponding number of time steps required for a typical run is of order @xmath52 .",
    "as far as the accuracy of the numerical method is concerned , we verified that the density fluctuations in the simulation are typically of order 0.01% and never exceed 0.54% .",
    "the typical value of @xmath53 , normalized by the ratio of the sound speed and the grid size , is of order @xmath54 , which is consistent with the magnitude of density fluctuations .",
    "therefore the above value for the base pressure @xmath26 is indeed large enough to mimic the incompressible behavior .",
    "we also confirmed that the compressible code can maintain the unperturbed equilibrium for stable cases .",
    "additionally we performed convergence tests for several cases and confirmed that the stability does not depend on the resolution .",
    "parameters of the solutions of which we examined the stability are summarized in table [ tab01 ] . in table",
    "[ tab01 ] and hereafter , we adopt the alfvn time @xmath55 for the normalization of time ; @xmath56 is _ defined in each case _ based on the alfvn speed @xmath57 at the entrance to the current sheet .",
    "this normalization allows us to separate the instability effects under study from amplification of magnetic field carried by the reconnection flow .",
    "the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath58 used in the normalization of the basic equations is @xmath59 since @xmath48 is the alfvn speed at the location where the magnitude of the magnetic field in equation ( [ eq : bsol ] ) is unity .",
    "here we have defined @xmath57 ignoring a factor @xmath60 , which is the maximum value of the dawson function , for simplicity .",
    "the growth of the system in each case is summarized in figure [ fig02 ] .",
    "we quantify the perturbation of the velocity distribution in the sheet by plotting the time evolution of @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time normalized by @xmath56 .",
    "the duration of the simulation is @xmath63 for the outflow solutions and @xmath64 for the inflow solutions .",
    "we stopped the simulations before the evolution of the system could be affected by the fixed boundary conditions .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] shows that a choice of parameters leads to instability of both the outflow and the inflow solutions .",
    "the nature of the detected instability is , however , entirely different for the two types of solutions .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ fig03 ] , in which the time evolution of some typical _ unstable _ solutions in both cases is shown . in the outflow solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ( a)(b ) ) , the current sheet along the @xmath35-axis is warped , and then vortices with magnetic islands are formed , suggesting that the kh instability occurs . on the other hand , in the inflow solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ( c)(d ) ) , the time development of the current distribution is symmetric with respect to the @xmath35-axis , and long and narrow magnetic islands are formed , which are characteristic features of the tearing instability .",
    "the difference of the unstable behavior comes from the fact that the velocity shear is stronger than the magnetic shear in the outflow solutions , @xmath32 , and vice versa in the inflow solutions , @xmath65 ( see the terms multiplying the dawson function in eqs . [ [ eq : bsol ] ] and [ [ eq : vsol ] ] ) .",
    "these features can be seen in figures [ fig04 ] and [ fig05 ] , which show the distributions of the ratio of the kinetic energy to the magnetic energy . in the outflow ( inflow )",
    "solutions , the kinetic ( magnetic ) energy is dominant near the current sheet .",
    "in this section , we discuss the parameter dependencies of the instabilities on the basis of the standard linear theories of the kh instability for the outflow solutions and the tearing instability for the inflow solutions .",
    "we also point out that the standard results , derived for uniform initial conditions outside the current sheet , have limited applicability to the pile - up solutions , characterized by strongly nonuniform profiles of the magnetic and velocity fields outside the sheet .",
    "the standard linear growth rate @xmath66 for the kh instability is given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the wave number , @xmath57 is the local alfvn speed , and @xmath69 is the difference in plasma velocities at the opposite edges of the sheet .",
    "note that @xcite discussed in detail the case of a uniform magnetic field whereas @xcite allowed for different magnetic field strengths on the two sides of a discontinuity .",
    "the expressions for @xmath66 are identical , however , if the magnetic field is symmetrical on either side of the current sheet , which is the case for the craig  henton solution .    when applying the formula for the instability growth rate to the craig ",
    "henton solution , it should be remembered that a continuous velocity profile has the effect of limiting the kh instability to large wave lengths , so that the most unstable mode has @xmath68 of order the inverse of the sheet thickness @xmath70 @xcite . in this case , since @xmath71 , @xmath72 recalling equations ( [ eq : vsol ] ) and ( [ eq : tata ] ) , it is straightforward to determine the maximum dimensionless linear growth rate : @xmath73 the corresponding growth rate normalized with @xmath56 ( see eq . [ [ eq : tata ] ] ) is given by @xmath74 linear theory predicts that , in order to overcome the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field , the shear has to be large enough , @xmath32 , which is the case for the outflow solution .    a major difference between the geometry of the standard kh instability and the outflow craig ",
    "henton solution is the strongly nonuniform profile of the reconnecting magnetic field and the associated presence of the current sheet at the surface @xmath75 .",
    "the stabilization condition , however , should not depend on whether or not the magnetic field is uniform .",
    "in fact it is clear on physical grounds that in either case the solution is stable as long as the average alfvn speed exceeds the fluid velocity difference ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand",
    ", we will see below that the growth rate of unstable solutions can be strongly modified by the global nonuniformity of the field outside the current sheet .",
    "note that the resistivity in our simulations is small enough for the time scale of the instability @xmath76 to be shorter than the diffusion time scale @xmath77 over the current sheet thickness @xmath70 .",
    "the diffusion time scale is defined as @xmath78 or @xmath79 in the dimensionless form .",
    "the ratio of @xmath80 to @xmath81 is typically several tens , and its smallest value is @xmath82 in cases c and d.    the dimensionless wave lengths of the fastest growing modes in the unstable cases can be explained by the linear theory , but the growth rates are smaller by an order of magnitude , compared with the predicted values in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "for example , in case b , the fastest growing mode has the wave length of @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03](a ) : @xmath83 ) , which agrees with the value predicted by the linear theory ( @xmath84 ) , while the growth rate ( @xmath85 ) is much smaller than the predicted value ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "one factor that may be responsible for this significant reduction in the growth rate is the magnetic field gradient outside the sheet , which is associated with the reverse electric current in the craig",
    " henton solution .",
    "the magnetic field pile - up on either side of the current sheet corresponds to the field variation of order @xmath87 over the length scale @xmath88 ( eq . [ [ eq : psol ] ] ) .",
    "since the corresponding energy density @xmath89 is comparable to the kinetic energy of the shearing motion ( eq . [ [ eq : vsol ] ] ) , the kh instability may be suppressed by the nonuniform magnetic field outside the sheet .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the tearing instability and the corresponding wave number are given by the following formulas , ignoring factors of order unity : @xmath90 where @xmath78 and @xmath91 are the diffusion and alfvn time scales in the current sheet of thickness @xmath70 .",
    "using equations @xmath92 , and ( [ eq : tata ] ) , we have the following expressions for the dimensionless linear growth rate and wave number for the tearing instability : @xmath93 where it should be remembered that @xmath33 and @xmath94 . the corresponding growth rate normalized with @xmath56",
    "is @xmath95 thus stronger inflows ( large @xmath18 ) and weaker two - dimensionality ( small @xmath19 ) are the factors that make the current sheet more unstable with respect to tearing .",
    "theory demands that @xmath96 be greater than @xmath97 for the instability , which is the case for the inflow solutions ( see table [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "the analytical estimate for @xmath98 ignores the effect of the reconnection flow on the instability .",
    "it is easy to see on physical grounds that a strong flow would carry the growing modes out of the reconnection region , thus suppressing the instability ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a rough condition for such stabilization is simply @xmath99 , which becomes @xmath100 for the flux pile - up reconnection solution under consideration .",
    "for typical simulation parameters , however , this condition is difficult to achieve unless @xmath101 , indicating a broad current sheet extending to the external boundaries .",
    "and @xcite studied the influence of the velocity shear on the tearing instability and found that the instability is suppressed when the flow shear is larger than the magnetic field shear at the neutral plane .",
    "it is worth remarking that the flow geometry assumed in our study is different .",
    "recall that the inflow craig ",
    "henton solution is defined by a weak shear , specifically @xmath102 .",
    "this condition is required in order to have a localized current sheet ( see section 2 ) .",
    "another difference with the problem investigated by is that the craig ",
    "henton solution possesses the reconnection outflow that also have a stabilizing effect .",
    "there is a formal similarity between stabilization by the velocity shear and the reconnection outflow , although the flow geometry is different .",
    "one also should remember that when the flow shear is large , the behavior of the reconnecting current sheet is more complex because it is no longer easy to distinguish the effects of the tearing and kh instabilities , and both effects are generally present @xcite .",
    "both the wave lengths and the growth rates in the unstable cases can be basically explained by the linear theory .",
    "for example , in case k , the fastest growing mode has the wave length of @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03](c ) : @xmath104 ) and the growth rate of @xmath105 , which agree fairly well with the values predicted by the linear theory ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) . furthermore , comparing ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ fig03 ] , the fastest growing mode in case n has a shorter wave length and a larger growth rate than that in case k , which is also consistent with the linear theory ( see table [ tab01 ] )",
    ".      equations ( [ eq : kh ] ) and ( [ eq : tear ] ) predict that the kh instability occurs in the outflow solutions ( @xmath32 ) and the tearing instability occurs the inflow solutions ( @xmath65 ) for any values of the parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the instabilities in our simulations can be interpreted using the standard linear theories .",
    "we found , however , that the craig ",
    "henton solution is stable for some values of the parameters .",
    "this indicates that the standard linear results , based on uniform initial conditions , are of limited use when analyzing the stability of global nonuniform mhd solutions .    in the application of linear theories to the solutions discussed above",
    ", we used the values of the velocity and magnetic field at the entrance to the current sheet .",
    "the solutions at hand , however , are neither one - dimensional nor uniform .",
    "we expect that , if the length scale of one - dimensionality is not large enough compared with the wave length for the most unstable mode , the instabilities will be modified owing to the resulting interaction with the external fields . in figure [ fig04 ] ( figure [ fig05 ] ) , the dark ( light ) color region outside the current sheet is the region where the kh ( tearing ) instability will be influenced by the external fields , since the magnetic ( kinetic ) energy is dominant there . for example",
    ", in case f , the kinetic - energy dominant region ( light color region ) is smaller than that in case b , and thus the kh instability occurs in a smaller region compared with case b ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ( a)(b ) )",
    ".    it may be argued , therefore , that the instabilities can be suppressed when the effects of two - dimensionality and nonuniformity , ignored in the standard treatment , become important in the initial configuration .",
    "equations ( [ eq : bsol ] ) and ( [ eq : vsol ] ) , describing the structure of the craig  henton solution , can be used to quantify the expected effect .",
    "the two - dimensional magnetic field in the outflow solution , for example , should start influencing the shearing velocity profile when the first term of equation ( [ eq : bsol ] ) becomes large compared with the second term of equation ( [ eq : vsol ] ) , that is when @xmath18 increases ( case h ) , @xmath7 decreases ( case c ) , or @xmath8 increases ( case d ) .",
    "this may explain why cases c ( small @xmath7 ) and d ( large @xmath8 ) in the outflow solution appear to be stable .",
    "a similar argument can be given for the inflow solution by comparing the first term of equation ( [ eq : vsol ] ) and the second term of equation ( [ eq : bsol ] ) .",
    "the two - dimensionality should come into play when @xmath18 increases ( case q ) , @xmath8 increases ( case m ) , or @xmath7 decreases ( case l ) .",
    "perhaps this is why we did not detect instability in cases l ( small @xmath7 ) , m ( large @xmath8 ) , and q ( large @xmath18 ) in the inflow solution .",
    "the lack of instability in cases l , m , and q is also consistent with the qualitative equation ( [ eq : stabilize ] ) .",
    "interestingly , it appears that this order - of - magnitude stability condition can be made quantitative if its left - hand side is multiplied by a factor of order @xmath108 .",
    "recall that a similarly large factor for the aspect ratio of a dynamic sweet ",
    "parker current sheet , stable with respect to tearing , was suggested by @xcite .",
    "this work is partly motivated by the idea that tearing of a large - scale current sheet in the solar corona can lead to impulsive energy release in solar flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the flux pile - up solution investigated in this paper is a member of the only exact analytical mhd family of solutions for magnetic reconnection that we are aware of , and analytical scalings based on these solutions may be of general interest .",
    "one important question is whether the growth rate of the tearing mode is sufficiently rapid if the realistic electric resistivity in the solar corona is assumed .",
    "our numerical results are in quantitative agreement with the linear theory of tearing instability as long as the stabilizing effects of two - dimensional geometry are small enough .",
    "we now proceed to show that the instability scalings do imply the possibility of rapid conversion of magnetic energy in a large - scale current sheet in the corona .",
    "the time - scale of destabilization , caused by tearing of a current sheet , is conveniently defined as @xmath109 . as discussed above",
    ", our simulations confirm that the growth rate for the flux pile - up solution @xmath110 can be estimated using equation ( [ eq : omega - tear ] ) . while solar observations put some constraints on the dimensions of reconnection regions , reconnection rates , and the electric resistivity , the observations are not detailed enough to specify the geometry of reconnective flows , given by the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is why , in order to apply the formula for @xmath110 to unstable current sheets in solar active regions , we rewrite equation ( [ eq : omega - tear ] ) as follows : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the lundquist number , and the dimensionless pile - up factor @xmath113 is simply the magnetic field at the entrance to the sheet relative to the reference value @xmath12 .",
    "this equation for @xmath114 reduces to the standard result for tearing in the sweet ",
    "parker current sheet , provided the pile - up is absent , in which case @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    adopting @xmath117 cm , @xmath118 g , and @xmath119 cm s@xmath120 as the reference values in a solar active region",
    ", we can estimate @xmath121 based on the classical value of electric resistivity .",
    "models for the structure of flaring current sheets suggest that their thickness is unlikely to exceed @xmath122 cm , which leads to @xmath123 .",
    "coronal magnetic fields are unlikely to exceed @xmath124 g , hence we should assume a modest pile - up factor @xmath125 .",
    "these numerical values result in the instability time - scale of order the alfvn time @xmath126 s. although nonlinear effects eventually come into play , this estimate for @xmath114 confirms that pile - up current sheets can be unstable to tearing and can be destroyed quite rapidly in the corona .",
    "this conclusion should remain qualitatively valid if current - driven instabilities give rise to plasma turbulence and enhanced electric resistivity in the sheet .",
    "although the sheet should thicken up due to increased resistivity , this effect will be partly balanced by the corresponding decrease in the effective lundquist number .",
    "a relevant question at this point is whether flux pile - up reconnection solutions adopted for our simulations are possible in the solar corona at all .",
    "it might be argued that , since the craig ",
    "henton solution is unstable for a wide range of parameters , it is not realized on the sun .",
    "we wish to stress , however , that the simulations also identified a parameter regime in which the craig ",
    "henton solution is stable .",
    "in particular the stability with respect to tearing in cases l , m , and q is consistent with the qualitative stabilization condition given by equation ( [ eq : stabilize ] ) .",
    "the stability appears to be intimately related to the two - dimensionality of the solution .",
    "equation ( [ eq : stabilize ] ) indicates that instability is easier to achieve when @xmath127 , which corresponds to one - dimensional merging of magnetic fields .",
    "the shear parameter @xmath19 would be difficult to determine observationally .",
    "as in our estimate for @xmath114 , however , we can eliminate @xmath19 in equation ( [ eq : stabilize ] ) by specifying the current sheet thickness @xmath70 . in order to give an illustrative example ,",
    "we assume @xmath128 and @xmath129 cm .",
    "then the stabilization condition can be written as @xmath130 , which corresponds to @xmath131 v @xmath132 in dimensional units .",
    "we suggest that stable two - dimensional solutions can describe relatively thick ( large @xmath70 ) , slowly reconnecting ( small @xmath7 ) , stable current sheets in the solar corona .    finally , based on this sensitivity of our numerical results to the global geometry of magnetic reconnection",
    ", it would be tempting to suggest that changes in the geometry of the solution may be responsible for rapid changes in the rate of magnetic energy release by magnetic reconnection and thus may trigger solar flares .",
    "one caveat is that we only performed a parametric study of stability of the steady flux pile - up solutions .",
    "a rigorous approach to the trigger problem would require the solution of a much more complicated task : we would have to track the dynamical evolution of a current sheet with time - dependent parameters that reflect , for example , a slow change in boundary conditions at the photosphere due to the emergence of magnetic flux and photospheric flows .",
    "exact mhd solutions are now available , which describe genuine flux pile - up magnetic reconnection , as opposed to simple one - dimensional merging @xcite .",
    "since these analytical solutions explicitly demonstrate many of the properties of fast reconnection , their analysis can be a powerful tool in the reconnection theory .",
    "furthermore , the solutions are known quantitatively to describe the results of numerical simulations performed using a time - dependent code .",
    "we have examined in this paper the stability of an exact two - dimensional solution for flux pile - up reconnection in incompressible resistive plasma .",
    "we used numerical simulations to show that the solutions of the outflow type can be kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( kh ) unstable and the solutions of the inflow type can be tearing unstable .",
    "notably , we used the steady craig ",
    "henton solution as an initial condition , thus allowing enough time for the instability to develop .",
    "our approach should be contrasted with that of a time - dependent simulation in which a localized current sheet was present for a finite ( perhaps insufficient ) time in a doubly periodic geometry .",
    "although the latter simulation provided some evidence that the sheet could break up into magnetic islands , it was not clear whether the tearing instability was responsible for the phenomenon .    in the outflow solutions , where a current sheet is formed by strong shearing flows , the kh instability was observed to develop .",
    "the numerical results can be qualitatively explained by the standard linear theory of the kh instability ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : kh ] ] ) .",
    "the absolute values of the growth rates , however , are smaller than those predicted",
    ". this may be due to the strongly nonuniform profile of the magnetic field at the entrance to the current sheet .",
    "the inflow solutions are characterized by a fast , weakly sheared inflow that leads to a strong magnetic field pile - up and the formation of a localized current sheet .",
    "these are the conditions under which the tearing instability is likely to develop .",
    "the computed growth rates can be explained fairly well by the standard linear theory of the tearing instability ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tear ] ] ) .",
    "the instability , however , is suppressed when the effects of two - dimensionality are large enough to modify the evolution of the flux pile - up current sheets .",
    "thus the numerical results often can be interpreted by applying standard results for the kh and tearing instabilities to the particular geometries of magnetic field and plasma flow , specified by the craig  henton solution .",
    "these instabilities cause turbulent and non - steady evolution of the current sheet , which is favorable for fast magnetic reconnection or particle acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases",
    ", however , the global nature of the solution leads to the suppression of the instabilities .",
    "of particular interest is the dependence of the growth rate and the most unstable wave length on the parameters of the reconnection solution : reconnection rate @xmath7 , resistivity @xmath8 , reconnection flow amplitude @xmath18 and shear @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we note that the sensitivity of the results to the nonuniform profiles of the magnetic and velocity fields in the reconnection region , as well as the effects of two - dimensionality of the solution , may be responsible for rapid changes in the rate of magnetic energy release by magnetic reconnection , which in turn may help in solving the trigger problem in solar flare research .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on vpp5000 at the astronomical data analysis center of the national astronomical observatory , japan ( project i d : yst15a and hst21a ) , which is an inter - university research institute of astronomy operated by ministry of education , science , culture , and sports , and on vpp5000 at the super computer center , nagoya university , by the joint research program of the solar - terrestrial environment laboratory , nagoya university .",
