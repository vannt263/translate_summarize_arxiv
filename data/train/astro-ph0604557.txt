    "in a previous paper , twenty years ago , @xcite hypothesised that the starburst seen in the peculiar `` minkowski s object '' ( mo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the cluster abell  194 was triggered by the radio jet emerging from the nucleus of the nearby active galaxy ngc541 .",
    "only one other example of jet - induced star formation was known at the time , in centaurus a @xcite , and the phenomenon of jet - induced star formation was considered more of a curiosity than something worthy of general interest . in both cases the radio galaxies are at low redshift and of relatively low radio luminosity .",
    "subsequent observations , with more sensitive detectors , larger telescopes , and better spatial resolution have shown that jet - induced star formation is more common than initially thought and examples have now been found in sources at low as well as high redshift , and with low ( fr - i type ) or high ( fr - ii type ) radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "for example , we now know that star formation in low redshift , low radio luminosity radio galaxies can occur in a variety of environments such as the central intergalactic medium ( igm ) in x - ray clusters like abell  1795 @xcite and the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their parent galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some of the most dramatic jet - induced star formation , with star formation rates ( sfr ) as high as 1000m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , is associated with very luminous radio galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath6 @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the radio sources are embedded in relatively dense , and presumably clumpy , media as evidenced by x - ray halos , cold gas ( ) , dust , bright line emission or a combination of these .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that the star formation may be induced by moderately slow ( @xmath7 ) radiative shocks as they encounter igm or ism clouds @xcite .",
    "these qualitative models have been developed primarily for the powerful high redshift radio galaxies , where the star formation is triggered by sideways expanding , radiative shocks in the relatively dense igm / ism of the gaseous halos in proto - clusters or young parent galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , little is known with certainty of the astrophysical conditions within the radio jets , including the composition of the jet fluid and its speed , as well as their environment , especially at high redshift .",
    "better knowledge about this would be of great general interest , as it would help with modeling outflows from black hole accretion disks and the conditions of the ism / igm in forming galaxies and their proto - clusters .",
    "numerical simulations are being used to explore the physical parameter range that is thought to be relevant to gain further insight . to help constrain such simulations",
    "mo is of special interest since in this case there is no obvious indication that the jet is propagating through some especially dense igm or ism environment .",
    "the abell  194 cluster does not have a luminous `` cooling '' x - ray halo like abell  1795 , and there is no evidence for much cold gas outside the jet like in centaurus  a. thus a better understanding of how the star formation in mo was triggered by the jet would also help in determining how much of a general phenomenon this might be .",
    "so why did the ngc541 radio jet trigger star formation ?",
    "was it just a chance encounter with a gas rich galaxy that wandered into path of the radio jet , which was then `` rejuvenated '' ?",
    "this would have been a lucky shot , given that mo is the only peculiar system within the central @xmath8,mpc of abell  194 and that its total ( projected ) diameter is the same as that of the radio jet .",
    "however , if there were an old stellar population underlying the starburst in mo , then this could not be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "as the observations of abell  1795 have shown , the interaction of jets with warm , clumpy gas in cooling flow clusters may well trigger the collapse of igm clouds and subsequent star formation .",
    "the development of the new massively - parallel cosmos numerical simulations package @xcite at livermore allowed @xcite to simulate the collision of an fr - i type jet with a gas cloud in an effort to see whether star formation could be induced by the jet in the case of mo .",
    "they assumed that ngc541 is surrounded by a multi - phase medium resembling galaxy cluster atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the simulations began with a hot `` mother '' cloud with a semimajor axis of 10kpc , a semiminor axis of 5kpc , density @xmath9@xmath10 , and temperature @xmath11k . within the mother cloud , denser , warm clouds",
    "were assumed to be embedded with typical sizes of 100pc , densities of @xmath12@xmath10 , and temperatures of @xmath13k .",
    "studies of the proto - typical fr - i radio galaxy 3c31 @xcite were used to estimate plausible parameters for the jet at the location of mo , 15kpc from ngc541 : a velocity of @xmath14 , a density of @xmath15@xmath10 , and a temperature of @xmath16k .",
    "@xcite concluded that it was indeed plausible that such star formation could be triggered by the driving of a radiative shock into such a cloud , causing the cloudlets to compress , radiatively cool , and break up into numerous dense , cold fragments .",
    "these fragments survive for many dynamical timescales and are presumably precursors to star formation .    motivated by these results from numerical simulations , and by the availability of new observing facilities since the previous study , we find this an opportune time to revisit mo in an attempt to better understand the nature of jet / cloud interactions .",
    "we will first discuss the various new observations obtained , supplemented by archival observations .",
    "then we proceed with an analysis of the spectroscopic and spectral energy distribution information , a discussion of the kinematics , morphology and time scales , and finally our conclusions and ideas for future work .",
    "we assume an @xmath17cosmology @xcite . at @xmath18 , mo and the abell  194 cluster are both at a comoving radial distance of 78.7mpc , and have a linear scale size of 0.374kpc  arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite published 1.4ghz very large array ( vla ) maps ( taken in a- , b- , and c - array ) of mo .",

    "mo shows considerable structure with a total projected size which is approximately the same as the jet diameter ( fig .",

    "is found along the northern edge of the jet .",
    "its brightest portion , a 3kpc - long bar - like feature lies on the side closest to ngc 541 and extends at almost a right angle to the jet .",
    "a much fainter , linear feature ( hereinafter referred to as mo - south ) extends to the south across the jet .",
    "the central , high surface brightness portion of the radio jet bisects these two components just south of the position of the peak of the star formation as seen in the optical images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hstrad ] ) .",

    ", the central portion of the abell  194 cluster was imaged by michael gregg on 2002 october 6 , using the prime focus camera ( pfcam ) on the lick observatory shane 3-m telescope .",
    "eight 600s exposures were made using the spinrad @xmath24filter , and five 600s exposures were made in @xmath25-band .",
    "the frames were reduced in the standard manner in iraf , and coadded using offsets determined from individual astrometric solutions for each frame .",

    "the image shows a large ( @xmath27kpc ) stellar bridge connecting the ellipticals ngc541 and the interacting galaxies ngc545 / 547 , which are associated with the large fr - i radio source 3c  40 @xcite .",
    "mo is located in this bridge , at least as seen in projection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfcamr ] ) , opening the possibility that the gas associated with mo has had its origin in some previous tidal interaction between these galaxies .",
    "the redshifts of these various systems are consistent : @xmath28 ( ngc541 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and @xmath31 ( ngc547 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      to determine the total extent of the star formation in mo and search for other possible emission - line features we obtained a narrow - band , dithered h@xmath2  image on 2004 december 17 using `` imager '' on the 2.3-m advanced technology telescope ( att ) at siding spring observatory .",
    "three 200s exposures of mo were made in the @xmath24-band filter , and three 600s exposures in a narrow - band filter centered at 668 nm ( to match redshifted h@xmath2  in mo ) .",
    "three 30s exposures in @xmath24-band were made of the emission - line flux standard 205 - 26.7 @xcite , and three 100s exposures in a narrow - band filter centered at 658 nm to provide the h@xmath2  flux calibration .",
    "the images in each filter were reduced in the standard manner in iraf , using sky flatfields appropriate to each filter . once the individual images had been registered and co - added , an astrometric fit was performed for each coadd , and the broad - band images were registered and geometrically scaled so that the pixel positions of objects in the broad - band and narrow - band images matched to sub - arcsecond accuracy .",
    "continuum subtraction was performed using the technique of @xcite .",
    "briefly , the reduced , registered broad - band and narrow - band images were rebinned to a size of @xmath32 pixels ( each pixel representing 256 pixels of the original image ) . the intensity ( in dn per second ) of each pixel in the rebinned @xmath24-band image",
    "was then plotted against that of the same pixel in the rebinned narrow - band image , excluding the brightest 500 pixels in the narrow - band image .",
    "a linear least - squares fit was performed , the slope of which represents the scaling factor between the two filters . the unbinned @xmath24-band image",
    "was then convolved with a gaussian filter to match the psf of the narrow - band image .",
    "it was then scaled by the slope of the fit obtained above , and subtracted from the unbinned narrow - band image .",
    "the scaling obtained for the standard star observations was 0.0438 , while that for the mo observations was 0.0554 .",
    "this is presumably due to differences in the narrow - band filter transmission curves ( since the same @xmath24-band filter was used for both fields ) , and the fact that the 668 filter samples a different part of the seds of the objects in the field to the 658 filter .",
    "the latter should be relatively unimportant due to the relatively small shift in wavelength between the two filters , except in the case of strong emission lines which may fall in one filter but not the other ( e.g. , h@xmath2  in particular ) .",
    "although this is the case for the main targets in each field , the good fit obtained when all binned pixels are included suggests that this effect is negligible , and that the main difference is due to the relative transmission of the filters .",
    "therefore , we scale the h@xmath2  fluxes measured from mo by the ratio of the slopes ( i.e. , the mo fluxes are multiplied by 0.791 ) to account for this .",
    "the resulting continuum - free h@xmath2  image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : haim ] and has a resolution of 1.3  fwhm .",
    "the total flux integrated within an equivalent 16  diameter aperture ( after correction for galactic reddening - see section  [ sec : red ] ) is determined to be @xmath33ergs s@xmath5 @xmath34 , yielding an h@xmath2  luminosity of @xmath35ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this is approximately twice the value obtained by @xcite ",
    "some 14% of this increase is attributable to the different cosmology used in their paper , and the remainder is presumably due to improvements in both the sensitivity and calibration of the current h@xmath2  observations .",
    "the h@xmath2  image is similar in its morphological features to the optical continuum images , with a strong concentration of  regions and their associated clusters in the linear bar - like feature facing the incoming jet , and more diffuse filaments of emission on the downstream side .",
    "these are more conspicuous in h@xmath2  than in the continuum , suggesting that the clusters in this region are somewhat younger than in the bar .",
    "mo - south is more clearly defined in h@xmath2 .",
    "the overall morphology is highly suggestive of a jet - cloud interaction , with subsequent star formation triggered by the jet .      to complement the hst @xmath19 and @xmath20-band observations , and to provide spectral energy distribution data over the widest possible range",

    "the best - fitting young population begins to fluctuate between models and the fit becomes increasingly poor .",
    "it seems reasonable , therefore , to conclude that less than 20%  ( and possibly as low as 0% ) of the light ( although possibly a larger percentage of the stellar mass ) in the aperture is due to an old population in mo itself , as suggested by the photometry in section  [ sec : photom ] .",
    "we used a technique similar to that employed by @xcite to obtain an age map for the galaxy .",
    "the registered , seeing - convolved images were binned 4 by 4 pixels .",

    "the edge of ngc541 at the lower right of the frame , and also the nearby small background galaxy , are fit with a 1gyr old population ( the oldest population considered in our fits ) .",
    "we are confident , therefore , that the pixel ages are representative of the dominant population .",
    "since young stellar populations tend to dominate the integrated light of a galaxy , we can not rule out an underlying old population , and indeed a small number of pixels in mo itself are best fit with older populations .",
    "however , this may be simply due to low signal - to - noise in the uv data in these pixels , which provides less discrimination between the primary and secondary minima in the @xmath149age plot ( the primary minimum tends to remain relatively sharply defined , whereas the secondary minimum becomes more broad , compared to the plots in figure  [ fig : mosed ] ) .",
    "the pixel ages are consistent , however , with a picture where jet - induced star formation propagates outward from a region near the central `` bar '' in mo .",

    "[ fig : threephot ] , corresponding to mo - south , mo - north , and the filamentary structure to the north of mo .",
    "following the same procedure as for the pixel age map , but using these larger boxes to improve signal - to - noise , we obtain ages ( with 68%  confidence limits ) of @xmath161myr , @xmath162myr , and @xmath163myr respectively for the three components .",
    "these more sensitive measurements support the conclusion from the pixel age map that mo - north was the first region to form stars , and that star formation spread over @xmath8myr to the regions further out ( mo south and the ne filament have the same age to within these quoted errors ) .",
    "presumably the star formation will continue to advance `` downstream '' in future , as the gas seen in the  map begins to form stars .",

    "our observations add some further insight into the first question . to learn more about the second will probably first require a better understanding of fr - i jets in general @xcite and , ultimately , numerical simulations of these types of jets .      the neutral hydrogen emission is intimately associated with the radio jet : the  appears to be ",

    "we note abell  194 is reportedly a `` poor and cold '' cluster @xcite and as such a population of relatively cool , dense clouds in its igm may well exist .",
    "the jet-  relationship in mo is different from that in centaurus  a , where the jet is running into a pre - existing , very extended structure found in rotation around ngc5128 @xcite .",

    "the velocity gradient is much smaller , @xmath166 , but the scenario may be qualitatively the same although in mo the entrained gas clouds were probably not cold but warm .",
    "however , also in this case the clouds will be accelerated , while they cool radiatively .",
    "following @xcite the velocity @xmath167 of the accelerated clouds is    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the density contrast between the cloud and background intercloud medium ; @xmath170 is the cloud radius ; @xmath171 is the shock velocity in the background intercloud medium , and @xmath172 is the time during which the cloud is being accelerated .",
    "this time will be at most @xmath173 yr , where @xmath174 is the cloud crossing time for the radiative shocks .",
    "for the parameters used by @xcite one finds @xmath175myr , @xmath176myr and @xmath177 .",
    "thus within the assumed framework of a jet interacting with a clumpy warm medium it is possible to explain the observed  velocity shear of @xmath178 .",
    "the vla , galex uv , and att h@xmath2  images all reveal that mo has a double structure which straddles the radio jet .",
    "in fact , the overall uv appearance of mo now looks very much like the radio - aligned rest - frame uv structure seen in the @xmath179 radio galaxy 4c41.17 @xcite , which is also thought to be due to jet - induced star formation @xcite .",
    "this an important qualitative result because it seems now more appropriate to assume that the star formation in mo occurs in the shear layers at the wall of the jet , i.e.  not in a head - on jet - cloud collision .",
    "this means that the jet / cloud collision in mo may be a more complex astrophysical problem than initially thought .",
    "the jet speed in such a shear layer will be lower than at the center , due to jet expansion and entrainment @xcite .",
    "the pressure in the wall shock is also lower than in the bow - shock of the jet .",
    "this translates to a lower speed for the radiative shocks in the entrained clouds , and the parameter space studied by @xcite then indicates that star formation may be easier to accomplish , at least with a certain range of pre - shock cloud densities .",
    "but perhaps more important is that shear layers of fr - i type jets are active sites of relativistic particle acceleration as evinced by radio spectral tomographic imaging which shows a remarkably flat radio spectral energy distribution across the jets @xcite .",
    "this is further supported by recent x - ray observations of the nearest fr - i radio jet , in centaurus a @xcite , which show that the jet is edge - brightened with a possible hardening of the x - ray spectrum in the outer regions . as a result",
    "the pressure of the relativistic fluid in these regions will be enhanced , which may affect the interaction with the clouds and the star formation process .",
    "the peak  column densities in the  blobs are about @xmath180 @xmath34 .",
    "this is just at the bottom of the range where , under galactic conditions , star formation would occur @xcite , but considering the relatively low spatial resolution of the  data , it could match more or less .",
    "however , the observed star formation sites are several kpc away from where the peaks in the  data are , i.e. , the star formation is not happening where the  says it should happen .",
    "so it may not be obvious to make the usual link between star formation and  column density .",
    "the same is true in the filament near centaurus  a where the  column densities are well above @xmath181 @xmath34 but only at those locations where there is _ no _ star formation .",
    "one can also compare the global star formation efficiency @xmath182 in mo to that of other systems .",
    "for mo we find @xmath42 4% , which is similar to that in centaurus  a ( a few percent ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indeed typical for starbursts in isolated dwarf galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is puzzling that , while the  emission downstream from mo - south is comparable to that of mo - north , the h@xmath2  and uv emission and hence the current star formation activity is much less there .",
    "it should be noted in this regard that the jet is disrupted in the region of mo , so it may well be that the jet - cloud interaction is simply stronger in mo - north than in mo - south .",
    "this would be the case if , for example , the sense of the jet precession was towards the north .",
    "the hst images for the first time reveal the presence of numerous `` blobs '' which appear to be young clusters associated with regions .",
    "we extracted photometry in 0.5-radius apertures for 20 of these blobs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blobs ] ) , converting from the hst filters to johnson @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and transforming the @xmath19-band measurements to absolute magnitudes .",
    "comparison with @xcite shows that the absolute magnitudes are what would be expected of young star clusters , and the colors of these blobs , when compared to fig .",
    "11 of @xcite , are just what would be expected for ages of a few myr ( consistent with all our other data ) .",
    "@xmath183-band data would be necessary in order to pin down these ages more accurately , and we would need to reach fainter magnitudes in order to compare with the color - magnitude diagrams for individual stars in centaurus  a by @xcite .          due to the tendency of a young population to dominate the integrated starlight in a galaxy , it is difficult to completely rule out the presence of an older pre - existing population .",
    "the situation in mo is even more complex due to its location in the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy ngc541 , and in the bridge of stars connecting ngc541 with two of the other ellipticals in the cluster . certainly , the spectroscopic and photometric data presented here agree that a population of order 7.5myr old is present in mo , and dominates the light output .",
    "the consistency of the pixel ages , the low internal reddening , and the lack of absorption lines expected from an old population , also support the conjecture that mo consists of a single - age population . additionally , the similar morphologies at f555w and @xmath37  are not what would be expected if an old , gas - rich dwarf galaxy wandered into the jet and had a new burst of star formation `` switched on '' by the jet - cloud interaction .",
    "the star formation also appears at the leading edge of the  cloud , as would be expected if it was the jet that caused the  and subsequently the stars to form ( since it takes time for the stars to form after the passage of the jet ) . as discussed above , however , it is not possible using these data to completely rule out the presence of an older underlying population in mo .",
    "it does seem clear , however , that the picture of a jet - cloud interaction , sometime a little more than 7.5myr ago , would be capable of causing the observed phenomena .",
    "examination of the radio maps shows that a jet plume @xcite extends up to 37kpc `` downstream '' of mo ( or somewhat further if the jet is not in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that this is a buoyant bubble @xcite as the jet is still `` switched on '' and the plume does not display the characteristic `` mushroom cloud '' shape .",
    "the fact that the jet is well - collimated until its interaction with mo , and disrupted downstream , as well as the similar size of the  cloud to the width of the jet , suggest that as the jet expanded , it ran into the gas cloud that ultimately formed mo .",
    "if mo was a pre - existing galaxy that wandered into the jet , it is unlikely that it would have done so at the precise time to cause the decollimation seen .",
    "the age of the downstream cocoon can therefore be estimated as the age of mo , plus the time taken for stars to begin forming after the jet - cloud interaction . taking a typical star formation timescale @xmath184  1myr @xcite",
    ", we assume that the cocoon expanded by at least 37kpc in 8.5myr , i.e. , at @xmath185 .",
    "if we assume that the sfr has been roughly constant during the lifetime of mo , this yields a timescale for the formation of the @xmath186@xmath1  of stars of 36.5myr .",
    "this is only a few times the 7.5myr inferred from the sed age dating . since it is plausible that the sfr was somewhat higher in the past , it is reasonable to assume that all the stars may have been formed since the jet - cloud interaction .",
    "the timescale for depletion of the observed  is much longer ( @xmath8gyr ) .",
    "we have presented new evidence that the star formation in mo was induced by a radio jet , primarily in the outer shear layers .",
    "this is similar to the jet - induced star formation associated with the centaurus a jet , and the radio - aligned star forming regions in powerful radio galaxies at high redshift .",
    "absorption and emission line measurements , and broad - band sed fitting , give a consistent age of around 7.5myr for mo . while it is not possible to completely rule out the presence of an old population in mo , the data are consistent with mo having formed _ de novo",
    "_ when the jet interacted with the ambient ism / igm .",
    "we discovered a double neutral hydrogen cloud which straddles the radio jet downstream of mo , at a location where the jet changes direction and de - collimates . unlike centaurus a , we propose that the  associated with mo formed _ in situ _ through cooling of clumpy warm gas , in the stellar bridge or cluster igm , as it was compressed by radiative shocks at the jet collision site , in agreement with earlier numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the star formation in mo then followed from the cooling and collapse of such  clouds , and the kinematics , which show 40  shear velocites , are also consistent with such models .",
    "the fr - i type radio source associated with mo is orders of magnitude lower in radio luminosity , and correspondingly more common , than the very luminous fr - ii type radio galaxies and their aligned star forming regions at high redshift . nevertheless , as mo shows , also these types of radio sources can trigger star formation , even if the ambient medium is only moderately dense .",
    "this suggests that jet - induced star formation may be quite common in the early universe , where gas densities in their parent , forming galaxies and surrounding proto - clusters were much higher than today , and when agn activity was much more prevalent .",
