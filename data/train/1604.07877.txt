    "however , when two curves are allowed to intersect more than once , the resulting complexity bounds become weaker .",
    "one strategy to address this issue is to cut each curve into several pieces so that the resulting pieces form a collection of pseudo - segments , and then apply the existing bounds for pseudo - segments to the resulting collection . if each pair of curves intersect at most @xmath8 times , then it is always possible to cut @xmath0 such curves into at most @xmath9 pieces , so that each pair of pieces intersect at most once .",
    "when one does this , however , the resulting complexity bounds for problems ( i)(iii ) are generally poor . in order to obtain better bounds , one must cut the curves into fewer pieces .",
    "this strategy has been pursued successfully for the past 15 years ; see  @xcite . however , previous work has almost exclusively focused on arrangements where each pair of curves can intersect at most twice ( sets of curves of this type are called _ pseudo - circles _ , or , if unbounded , _ pseudo - parabolas _ ) . the current best result in this direction",

    "however , the case of many faces is considerably more difficult , and it raises several technical issues that , so far , we do not know how to overcome .",
    "we briefly discuss these difficulties , and leave this extension as an interesting open problem .    the approach , as in the case of incidences , would be to pass to the dual @xmath26-dimensional space . in the dual space , curves become points and the marking points become algebraic varieties .",
    "we even have a slight advantage here , because we can perturb the marking points slightly to ensure that they are in general position .",
    "one would then apply a polynomial partitioning in the dual space , apply the bound of theorem [ manyfacescurvesweakbd ] within each cell , and combine the bounds into a global bound for the whole problem . however , there are several major issues that arise here .    *",
    "( a ) * within a cell @xmath183 of the partition , we have a subset @xmath441 of points of @xmath22 whose dual surfaces cross @xmath183 , and a subset @xmath442 of curves of @xmath2 whose dual points lie in @xmath183 .",
    "the recursive subproblem at @xmath183 would then be to bound the complexity of the faces marked by the points of @xmath441 in the arrangement @xmath443",
    ". however , this is not enough , as the points of @xmath444 also mark faces of @xmath443 , and we have to estimate the complexity of these faces as well .",
    "informally , this is an effect of the `` non - local '' nature of the curve - face incidence relation : in contrast to the case of point - curve incidences , the property that a curve @xmath66 bounds the face marked by a point @xmath65 is a global property that depends on the whole collection of curves and not just on @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in general , the complexity of these ( many ) additional faces of @xmath443 could be too large for the recursive analysis to yield the desired improved bound .    *",
    "( b ) * as in the case of incidences , we need to bootstrap the recursion at subproblems for which @xmath445 is much smaller than @xmath446 . concretely , if we are to obtain the same bound as for incidences , the threshold would be @xmath447 .",
    "we would then need to argue that in this case the complexity of the marked faces is linear , or at least close to linear , in @xmath446 .",
    "again , the non - local nature of the problem makes it sifficult to show this .",
    "for example , we do not know whether the machinery in fox et al .",
    "@xcite can be applied here , as it was in the case of incidences .    *",
    "( c ) * when combining the bounds obtained at the recursive subproblems into a global bound , there are several additional technical issues that are more challenging when bounding the complexity of marked faces rather than incidences .",
    "for example , unlike the case of incidences , we can not just add up the recursive bounds .",
    "this is because the structure of faces in an arrangement obtained by overlaying several sub - arrangements can become quite involved .",

    ", this means that by further restricting @xmath531 if necessary , a vertical line passing through @xmath531 intersects each of these curves in exactly one point . we conclude that @xmath504 is constant for all @xmath534 .",
    "if we remove every point @xmath65 from each curve @xmath539 for which either @xmath507 or @xmath92 has a vertical tangent vector at @xmath65 , then we have eliminated all depth cycles of type ( ii ) and ( iv ) .",
    "note that in eliminating the depth cycles of type ( ii ) , ( iii ) , and ( iv ) , we have made a total of @xmath458 cuts .",
    "this concludes the proof of lemma [ cuttingtoeliminateiiiv ] .",
    "we are now ready to prove lemma [ cutspacecurves ] .",
    "we will do so using induction on @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is smaller than some constant threshold @xmath540 ( that the following analysis will implicitly specify ) , the result is immediate .",
    "indeed , we can cut each curve @xmath541 at each point whose @xmath99-projection is also incident to the @xmath99-projection of another curve , and this requires at most @xmath542 cuts .",
    "the latter quantity is bounded by @xmath543 , provided we choose @xmath345 sufficiently large ( depending on @xmath540 ) .",

    "it remains to consider cycles of type ( i ) .",

    "thus if we apply the induction hypothesis inside each cell , we conclude that the number of cuts needed to eliminate all cycles of type ( i ) is    @xmath549 \\big)\\leq c_1 a n^{3/2}(\\log n - 2\\log e + c_2)^\\kappa,\\ ] ]    where @xmath281 and @xmath282 are constants depending only on @xmath12 . since @xmath545 , we have @xmath550 . if @xmath0 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath282 , then @xmath551",

    "in this section we will compare the conditions imposed by theorem [ incidencesptscurves ] with the conditions from pach and sharir s incidence theorem .",
    "since theorem [ incidencesptscurves ] only applies to algebraic curves , we will restrict our attention to curves of this type .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that pach and sharir s incidence theorem does not require that the curves be algebraic .",
    "pach and sharir s incidence theorem applies to sets of points @xmath254 and sets of ( algebraic ) plane curves @xmath13 that have @xmath26 degrees of freedom and multiplicity type @xmath25 .",

    "the property of having @xmath26 degrees of freedom ( and multiplicity type @xmath25 ) depends only on the finite collections @xmath22 and @xmath13 .",
    "while @xmath13 might be ( secretly ) taken from some pre - specified family of curves , pach and sharir s incidence theorem has no knowledge of this family .    in practice , however , the curves in @xmath13 _ are _ taken from a pre - specified family of curves , and we usually prove that @xmath560 has @xmath26 degrees of freedom by arguing that _ any _ set of curves from this family ( and any set of points ) has @xmath26 degrees of freedom . the following theorem will show that , under some mild conditions , if @xmath208 is a family of curves , and if _ every _ finite set of curves from @xmath208 has @xmath26 degrees of freedom , then @xmath208 must be an @xmath26-dimensional family of curves . the converse is more subtle and will be discussed further at the end of this section .",
    "let @xmath561 be an irreducible variety .",
    "we say that @xmath208 is _ degenerate _ if there is an irreducible curve @xmath562 that is a component of every curve @xmath563 .",
    "degenerate families are not interesting from the point of view of incidence geometry , since it is possible to select @xmath0 curves from a degenerate family and @xmath23 points that yield @xmath564 incidences .",
    "generally , we rule out this situation by requiring that no two curves share a common component .",
    "if the curves are chosen from a degenerate family then the only way this condition can be satisfied is if there is only one curve .",
    "if @xmath561 is a ( possibly reducible ) variety , we say @xmath208 is degenerate if any of its irreducible components are degenerate . in practice",
    ", we can throw away any degenerate components of @xmath208 , since there are @xmath261 degenerate components total , and if we require that no two curves share a common component then at most one curve can be chosen from each degenerate component of @xmath208 .",

    ". then @xmath567 , i.e. the dimension of @xmath208 is at most the ( worst - case ) number of degrees of freedom of a collection of curves taken from @xmath208 ( with respect to any finite point set @xmath22 ) .",

    "we claim that there exists a point @xmath248 so that @xmath576 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath577 .",
    "indeed , since the irreducible component of @xmath208 containing @xmath578 is non - degenerate , @xmath579 only contains the point @xmath578 .",
    "thus there exists a hyperplane @xmath580 that is transverse to @xmath208 at @xmath578 , so ( by making @xmath217 smaller if necessary ) , @xmath581 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath577 .",
    "repeat this @xmath26 times ; we obtain a smooth manifold @xmath582 of dimension @xmath583 .",
    "since the irreducible component of @xmath208 containing @xmath578 is non - degenerate , we can select @xmath584 points from this manifold that correspond to curves in @xmath7 , no two of which have a common irreducible component .",

    "we conclude that @xmath586 .",
    "the converse direction is a bit more subtle .",
    "for example , let @xmath587 and let @xmath561 be the family of all curves of degree at most @xmath12 that pass through the point @xmath532 .",
    "then @xmath588 , but for each @xmath25 , it is possible to find a finite set of points @xmath22 and a set of irreducible curves @xmath339 so that @xmath560 fails to have @xmath589 degrees of freedom and multiplicity type @xmath25",
    ". however , such an example is `` cheating , '' since @xmath22 must contain the point @xmath532 .",
    "if we require that @xmath590 , then @xmath560 will have @xmath589 degrees of freedom and multiplicity type @xmath107 .",
