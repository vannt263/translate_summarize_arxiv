    "molecular hydrogen is the dominant constituent of dense interstellar gas , and h@xmath0 quadrupole transitions are a significant coolant of such gas over a wide range of temperatures and densities ( neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) .",
    "although quadrupole vibrational transitions of h@xmath0 near @xmath11 m have been widely observed from interstellar clouds that are strongly irradiated by ultraviolet radiation or have been heated by shock waves to temperatures @xmath12  k ( e.g. shull & beckwith 1982 ; beckwith et al .  1978 ; gatley et al .",
    "1987 ; chrysostoniou et al.1993 ; and many others ) , molecular hydrogen within cooler clouds that are not uv - irradiated is only detectable by means of its pure rotational lines . with a broad spectral coverage that is uninterrupted by atmospheric absorption regions , the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ; de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) has allowed the complete h@xmath0 rotational spectrum to be observed from the interstellar medium for the first time .",
    "pure rotational emissions from h@xmath0 have been detected by iso toward several regions of star formation within the galaxy  including s140 ( timmermann et al .",
    "1996 ) , cepheus a west ( wright et al .",
    "1996 ) , the bd+40@xmath134124 group ( wesselius et al .",
    "1996 ) , and orion - irc2 ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1998 )  as well as towards several external galaxies ( e.g. arp 220 ; sturm et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 line ratios provide valuable constraints upon the physical conditions in the emitting gas , implying typical temperatures of 500 - 800 k for those galactic sources that have been observed to date .",
    "these temperatures are much greater than those typical of cold quiescent clouds ( @xmath14  k ) , and presumably reflect the effects of shock heating or radiative heating by a nearby star or protostar . as far as we are aware ,",
    "all iso observations of such sources ( prior to those reported in this letter ) are consistent with an ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratio of three , the value expected at temperatures above @xmath15  k if the observed regions have been warm long enough to reach equilibrium between the ortho ( odd @xmath16 states with total nuclear spin 1 ) and para states ( even @xmath16 states with total nuclear spin zero ) . also indicated ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratios consistent with the values expected in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus infrared absorption line observations of ngc 2024 irs 2 ( lacy et al .",
    "1994 ) implied an ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratio @xmath17 , consistent with the value of 0.2 expected at the temperature ( @xmath18  k ) of the absorbing gas , while ultraviolet absorption line observations toward hot stars ( savage et al .",
    "1977 ) using the copernicus satellite have revealed typical ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratios @xmath19 in diffuse clouds , again consistent with thermal equilibrium at the temperatures @xmath20  k that are typical of such clouds .",
    "we note that _ vibrational _ emissions from warm photodissociation regions and planetary nebulae often exhibit ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratios _ in excited vibrational states _ that are smaller than the value of 3 expected in equilbrium at high temperature ( e.g. hasegawa et al .",
    "1987 , ramsay et al .",
    "1993 , chrysostomou et al .",
    "1993 , hora & latter 1996 ) , with typical values in the range 1.7 - 2.1 .",
    "however , sternberg & neufeld ( 1998 ) have argued that these ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratios measured for excited vibrational states do not require _ true _",
    "ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratios smaller than 3 but are simply a consequence of optical depth effects in the fluorescent pumping of the observed vibrational emissions . ]    in this letter we report the results of iso observations of molecular hydrogen in the source hh 54 , a herbig - haro object located at the edge of the chamaleon ii dark cloud at an estimated distance @xmath15  pc from the sun ( hughes & hartigan 1992 ) .",
    "the source of the outflow responsible for hh 54 is believed to be iras 12496 - 7650 ( hughes et al .",
    "1989 ) , a deeply embedded young stellar object lying approximately @xmath21 to the southwest .",
    "previous observations of infrared h@xmath0 vibrational lines ( gredel 1994 ) and optical line emissions ( schwarz & dopita 1980 ) have suggested the presence of hot , shock - excited gas in hh 54 .",
    "our observations are described in  2 below , and our results reported in  3 below .",
    "a discussion follows in  4 , in which particular emphasis is placed upon the non - equilibrium ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratio @xmath22 measured in hh 54 .",
    "using the sws of iso in its grating mode ( sws02 ) , we observed the s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(3 ) , s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines of h@xmath0 toward the source hh 54 on 1997 november 4th .",
    "the iso beam was centered midway between two strong sources of h@xmath0 vibrational emission , positions e and k ( sandell et al .  1987 ) , at coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( j2000 ) , with the long axis of the beam oriented at position angle 118@xmath13 .",
    "the total observing time on target was 6400 s , including overheads for dark current measurements and calibration .",

    "@xmath26 uncorrected for extinction    @xmath27 beam averaged    @xmath28 computed with a correction for extinction ( see text )    the initial data reduction was carried out with version 6.22 of the iso pipeline software , and the isap software package was then used to remove bad data points and to co - add the individual spectral scans .",
    "figure 1 shows the sws h@xmath0 spectra observed toward hh 54 e+k . in every case ,",
    "the observed line width is no broader than the instrumental response function , i.e.  the lines are unresolved at the resolution of the sws grating mode .",
    "the measured line fluxes , beam - averaged line intensities and beam - averaged h@xmath0 column densities in rotational states @xmath29 through 7 are given in table 1 .",
    "the current sws flux calibration is believed accurate to @xmath30 . in computing the h@xmath0 column densities",
    ", we used the spontaneous radiative rates of turner , kirby - docken , & dalgarno ( 1977 ; confirmed recently by the more precise calculations of wolniewicz , simbotin & dalgarno 1998 ) for quadrupole transitions of h@xmath0 , which imply that the lines that we observed are all optically thin .",
    "we also applied dust extinction corrections based upon the interstellar extinction curves of draine ( 1989 ) , adopting gredel s ( 1994 ) estimate of 0.3 mag for @xmath31 that was obtained from observations of the [ feii ] lines at 1.257 and 1.644  @xmath32 m toward hh 54 e+k .",
    "the assumed extinctions for the s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(3 ) , s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines were accordingly 0.10 , 0.12 , 0.30 , 0.09 and 0.04 mag respectively ratio derived below are only very weakly dependent upon the exact shape of the assumed extinction curve and are negligibly altered even if the silicate features are assumed to be entirely absent . ] .",
    "figure 2 shows a `` rotational plot '' for h@xmath0 rotational states @xmath29 through 7 . here the logarithm of @xmath33 is plotted against @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the beam - averaged column density , @xmath36 is the rotational degeneracy , @xmath37 is the spin degeneracy ( 1 for even @xmath16 and 3 for odd @xmath16 ) , and @xmath38 is the energy of the state of rotational quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "open squares correspond to the values tabulated in table 1 , with column densities averaged over regions of size @xmath39 for @xmath29 and 4 and size @xmath40 for @xmath41 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "the filled squares for @xmath29 and 4 show values that have been corrected to the smaller beam size of @xmath40 , on the assumption that the emission region is small compared to either beam .",
    "that assumption , adopted hereafter in the discussion , is appropriate if the h@xmath0 s(1 ) and s(2 ) emission follows the compact distribution of the higher - excitation vibrational emission mapped by gredel ( 1994 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that the points corresponding @xmath29 , 5 , and 7 are colinear to within the observational uncertainties , consistent with the emission expected from gas in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath42  k. however , the column densities in @xmath43 and 4 lie substantially above the best - fit line for the ortho ( odd-@xmath16 states ) , implying that the ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratio ( opr ) is smaller than the high temperature equilibrium value of 3 expected at 700  k. our best fit to all the data points implies an opr of @xmath3 , a gas temperature of @xmath44  k , and a total h@xmath0 column density of @xmath45 ( averaged over a @xmath40 beam ) .    the rotational temperature derived for hh 54",
    "e+k is larger than the temperature @xmath46  k derived by liseau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from iso long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) observations of co transitions towards hh 54 b , a difference that presumably results from the different pointing and larger lws beam size used by liseau et al . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath0 rotational temperature we derived towards hh 54 e+k is _ smaller _ than the temperature of 2100 k derived by gredel ( 1994 ) from the observed ratio of the h@xmath0 @xmath47 and @xmath48 vibrational bands .",
    "again , such a discrepancy is unsurprising and probably indicates that a mixture of shock velocities and gas temperatures is present within the beam , with vibrational emissions selectively probing hotter gas associated with faster shocks .",
    "our measurement of an opr smaller than 3 in gas of temperature @xmath2  k is _ prima facie _ evidence that the gas has not been warm long enough to reach equilibrium between the ortho and para states ; thus the measured opr @xmath22 is the legacy of an earlier stage in the thermal history of the gas when the opr had reached equilibrium at a value @xmath49 ( corresponding to a gas temperature @xmath4  k ) .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the time period , @xmath50 , for which the emitting gas has been warm by estimating the timescale for conversion from para- to ortho - h@xmath0 , @xmath51 . in media of low fractional ionization , the conversion of para- to ortho - h@xmath0 is dominated by reactive collisions with atomic hydrogen , for which the rate coefficient at 650  k is @xmath52 ( tin et al .",
    "1997 ) : thus @xmath51 is given by @xmath53 \\,\\rm yr$ ] , where @xmath54 is the density of hydrogen atoms .",
    "( even if other interconversion mechanisms are significant , this is in any case an upper limit on @xmath51 .",
    ")    models for the chemistry of dense molecular gas ( e.g. neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) predict that once the temperature of the gas exceeds @xmath55",
    "k , atomic oxygen will be rapidly converted to water , a prediction that has been supported by recent observations of water toward warm shocked regions in the orion molecular cloud ( harwit et al .",
    "the production of water takes place by means of a series of two hydrogen atom abstraction reactions with h@xmath0 and therefore leads to the production of two hydrogen atoms for each water molecule produced ; thus the atomic hydrogen density in recently - heated gas at temperature 650  k is at least twice the atomic oxygen density that was present in the gas prior to its being heated .",
    "assuming an initial o abundance , @xmath56 of @xmath57 ( consistent with the gas - phase oxygen and carbon abundances of cardelli et al .",
    "1995 and the assumption that o accounts for most of the gas - phase oxygen not bound as co ) , this places an upper limit of @xmath58\\,\\rm yr$ ] on @xmath51 .",
    "( this conservative upper limit still applies , of course , even if atomic hydrogen is produced by other mechanisms in addition to the reaction of o with h@xmath0 to form water ) .",
    "finally , the fact that the @xmath59 state is apparently thermalized ( c.f . figure 2 ) implies a lower limit on the h@xmath0 density of @xmath60 , the critical density at which the collisional de - excitation rate for @xmath59 ( tin et al .",
    "1997 ) is equal to the spontaneous radiative decay rate ( turner et al .  1977 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the emitting gas that we observed in hh 54 has been warm for a period @xmath61 \\,{\\rm yr } \\simlt 5000\\ , [ { \\rm 10 ^ 5\\,cm}^{-3 } / n({\\rm h_2})]\\,{\\rm yr }   \\simlt 5000{\\,\\rm yr}$ ] .",
    "transient heating by shock waves  observed widely in herbig - haro objects  provides a natural explanation of the non - equilibrium opr that we observed .",
    "indeed , a non - equilibrium opr within molecular gas heated by slow shocks has been predicted recently by timmermann ( 1998 ) , who presented a detailed theoretical treatment of ortho - para interconversion within slow ` c'-type shocks .",
    "timmermann obtained predictions for the h@xmath0 rotational line strengths for shocks of velocity 10 to @xmath62 that propagate in gas of preshock h@xmath0 density @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and preshock ortho to para - h@xmath0 ratio opr@xmath66 or 3 .",
    "the results show that para - to - ortho conversion is incomplete for shock velocities smaller than 20 to 25 @xmath67  the timescale for equilibration being longer than the shock timescale  so that slow shocks with opr@xmath66 show a non - equilibrium opr within the postshock region .",
    "figure 3 shows a quantitative comparison between the observed s(2)/s(1 ) and s(3)/s(1 ) line flux ratios and timmermann s predictions for a preshock h@xmath0 density of @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , none of the shock parameters actually considered by timmermann yields a s(2)/s(1 ) ratio large enough ( i.e.  a postshock opr small enough ) to match the observations .",
    "however , we have interpolated and extrapolated timmermann s results to cases ( dotted lines ) where the initial opr is other than 1 or 3 , assuming that the line fluxes depend linearly transitions tend to zero in the limit of small initial opr and small shock velocity . ] upon the initial para - h@xmath0 fraction , @xmath69 .",
    "our extrapolation shows that a shock of velocity @xmath70 can provide a satisfactory fit to the s(2)/s(1 ) and s(3)/s(1 ) line ratios , given a sufficiently small initial ortho- to para - h@xmath0 ratio , @xmath71 ,    the results of timmermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also provide an explanation for why previous studies ( e.g. smith , davis & lioure 1997 ) of vibrational emissions from protostellar outflows and herbig - haro objects have always revealed an opr close to 3 : vibrational emissions inevitably trace faster , hotter shocks in which the atomic hydrogen fraction is enhanced by streaming ion - neutral collisions and the rate coefficients for reactive collisions between h and h@xmath0 are larger .",
    "thus timmermann s models predict that para - to - ortho conversion is rapid enough to yield an equilibrium opr of 3 behind any shock that is fast enough to excite significant vibrational emission .",
