    "rare @xmath1 meson decays , induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath2 transitions constitute one of the most important class of decays for testing the gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these decays which are forbidden in the sm at tree level , occur at loop level and provide insight to check the predictions of the sm at quantum level",
    ". moreover , these decays are also quite sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond the sm , since new particles running at loops can give contribution to these decays .",
    "the new physics manifests itself in rare decays in two different ways ; one via modification of the existing wilson coefficients in the sm , or through the introduction of some new operators with new coefficients which are absent in the sm .",
    "some of the most important exclusive fcnc decays governed by @xmath3 transition at quark level are @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "the decays of the kind @xmath6 , where @xmath7 stands for pseudoscalar or vector mesons , enable the investigation of the experimental observables , such as , lepton pair forward ",
    "backward ( fb ) asymmetry , lepton polarizations , etc .",
    "one of the most efficient ways in looking for new physics beyond the sm is the measurement of lepton polarization in the decays .",
    "polarization of a single lepton has been studied in @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11@xcite and @xmath12 @xcite decays in detail in fitting the parameters of the sm and set constraints on new physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , as has already been pointed out in @xcite , some of the single lepton polarization asymmetries might be quite small to be observed and might not provide sufficient number of observables in checking the structure of the effective hamiltonian . by taking both lepton polarizations into account simultaneously ,",
    "maximum number of independent observables are constructed .",
    "it is clear that , measurement of many more observables which would be useful in further improvement of the parameters of the sm probing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it should be noted here that both lepton polarizations in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays are studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the decays of @xmath1 mesons induced by the @xmath15 transition are promising in looking for cp violation since the ckm factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the sm are all of the same order .",
    "for this reason cp violation is much more considerable in the decays induced by @xmath19 transition .",
    "so , study of the exclusive decays @xmath20 are quite promising for the confirmation of the cp violation and these decays have extensively been investigated in the sm @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the double  lepton polarization asymmetries in the exclusive @xmath21 decay in a model independent way , including all possible forms of interactions into the effective hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , we study the correlation between the double  lepton polarization asymmetries and the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay , in order to find such regions of new wilson coefficients in which the branching ratio ( as well as single ",
    "lepton polarization ) coincides with the sm prediction while the double  lepton polarization asymmetries do not .",
    "it is clear that if such a region of the new wilson coefficients exists it is an indication of the fact that new physics beyond the sm can be established by measurement of the double  lepton polarizations only .",
    "note that the double  lepton polarizations in the @xmath14 and @xmath22 decays are studied in @xcite and @xcite in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , we obtain the matrix element in terms of the form factors of the @xmath23 transition . in section 3",
    "we derive the analytical results for the nine double  lepton polarization asymmetries .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis , discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we calculate the double lepton polarizations using a general form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath21 process is governed by @xmath15 transition at quark level .",
    "the matrix element for the @xmath15 transition can be written in terms of the twelve model independent four  fermi interactions in the following form : [ e7001 ] h_eff v_tdv_tb^\\ { c_sl |d_r i _",

    "( [ e7001 ] ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are the nonlocal fermi interactions , which correspond to @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the next four terms with coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the vector type interactions .",
    "two of these vector interactions containing @xmath34 and @xmath35 do already exist in the sm in the form @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written as c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the contributions of the new physics .",

    "it should be noted here that , in further analysis we will assume that all new wilson coefficients are real , as is the case in the sm , while only @xmath44 contains imaginary part and it is parametrized in the following form [ e7002 ] c_9^eff = _ 1 + _ u _ 2  , where _ u =  , and [ e7003 ] _ 1 4.128 + 0.138 ( ) + g(_c , ) c_0(_b ) - g(_d , ) ( c_3 + c_4 ) + g(_b , ) ( 4 c_3 + 4 c_4 + 3c_5 + c_6 ) + ( 3 c_3 + c_4 + 3c_5 + c_6 )  , + _ 2 ( 3 c_1 + c_2 )  , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and [ e7004 ] ( ) - ^2 - li_2()- ( ) ( 1- ) - ( 1- ) + ( ) +  , represents the @xmath48 correction coming from one gluon exchange in the matrix element of the operator @xmath49 @xcite , while the function @xmath50 represents one  loop corrections to the four  quark operators @xmath51@xmath52 @xcite , whose form is [ e7005 ] + \\ { ( 1-y_q)+ ( y_q-1 ) ( ) }  , where @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the short distance contributions , @xmath54 decay also receives long distance contributions , which have their origin in the real @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 intermediate states , i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 family .",
    "there are four different approaches in taking long distance contributions into consideration : a ) hqet based approach @xcite , b ) amm approach @xcite , c ) lsw approach @xcite , and d ) ks approach @xcite . in the present work we choose the amm approach , in which these resonance contributions are parametrized using the breit  wigner form for the resonant states . the effective coefficient @xmath44 including the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 resonances are defined as [ e7006 ] c_9^eff = c_9 ( ) + y_res ( )  , where [ e7007 ] y_res - \\ { c^(0 ) ( ) + _ u _ v_i= k_i + _ u g(_u , ) _ v_i= , }  .",
    "the phenomenological factor @xmath61 has the universal value for the inclusive @xmath62 decay @xmath63 @xcite , which we use in our calculations .    the decay amplitude for the exclusive @xmath21 decay is obtained from the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian in eq . ( [ e7001 ] ) over @xmath1 and @xmath58 meson states , which can be parametrized in terms of various form factors .",

    "when @xmath24 is positive the situation changes to the contrary , except for the tensor interaction ( neglecting the narrow region for the coefficient @xmath43 ) . the numerical analysis for the rest of the remaining double",
    " lepton polarization asymmetries for the @xmath139 decay are not presented in this work due to their negligible smallness .",
    "it follows from the present analysis that few of the double  lepton polarization asymmetries show considerable departure from the sm predictions and these ones are strongly dependent on different types of interactions .",
    "hence , the study of these quantities can play crucial role in establishing new physics beyond the sm .    at the end of this section",
    ", we would like to discuss the following problem .",
    "could there be a case in which the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm result , while double  lepton polarization asymmetry does not ? in order to answer this question we study the correlation between the @xmath146 and the branching ratio @xmath147 .",
    "we can briefly summarize the results of our numerical analysis as follows : for the @xmath148 decay , except for a very narrow region of @xmath33 , such a region is absent for all new wilson coefficients for all of the asymmetries @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath150 decay is more informative for this aim , which are measurable in the experiments . in figs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) we present the dependence of @xmath151 and @xmath123 on the branching ratio .",
    "it follows from these figures that , there indeed exists certain regions of @xmath24 for which the double  lepton polarization asymmetry differs from the sm prediction , while the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm result .",
    "we also note that , such a region exists for the remaining double  lepton polarization asymmetries for the tensor interaction as well .    in conclusion , in the present work",
    "we investigate the double  lepton polarization asymmetries when both leptons are polarized , using a general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we obtain that various double  lepton polarization asymmetries can serve as a good test in looking for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "we also study the correlation between @xmath152 and the branching ratio for the @xmath150 decay and find out that there exist regions of the new wilson coefficients for which the double  lepton polarization asymmetry differs considerably from the sm prediction , while the branching ratio coincides with the sm prediction . therefore in these regions",
    "the new physics effects can be established just by measuring the double  lepton polarizations .",
