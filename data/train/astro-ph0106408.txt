    "recent study of the dynamics of gas and stars in the nuclear regions of nearby galaxies has led to two remarkable discoveries : ( i ) the overwhelming majority of spheroidal galaxies in the nearby universe contain massive black holes ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; miyoshi et al . 1996",
    "; richstone et al . 1998 ; ghez et al . 1998 ; van der marel 1999 ; genzel et al .",
    "2000 ; kormendy and ho 2000 ) , and ( ii ) there is a clear correlation between the black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the spheroid ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "this latter correlation suggests a ` causal connection between the formation and evolution of the black hole and the bulge ' ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , meaning that black holes may be a fundamental component of galaxies , and not simply exotica giving rise to agn phenomenon ( richstone et al .",
    "a possible explanation for this correlation is that massive black hole and spheroid formation are co - eval , occurring during the collapse of a galaxy from the primordial density field .",
    "such a model is motivated by the fact that the correlation of black mass with velocity dispersion is significantly tighter than that with spheroid luminosity , implying that systems with greater dissipation during collapse , ie .",
    "high surface brightness , compact spheroids with high velocity dispersion , form larger black holes .",
    "possible supporting evidence for co - eval starbursts and agn at high redshift is the detection of copious emission from warm dust in high redshift qsos ( mcmahon et al . 1994 ; omont et al . 1996a ; andreani et al .",
    "1999 ; carilli et al .",

    "searches with mjy sensitivity at 250 ghz have yielded detections of 41 qsos at @xmath5 , out of a total of 147 sources observed .",
    "the implied far infrared ( fir ) luminosities are of order @xmath6 l@xmath3 with implied dust masses of a @xmath7 m@xmath3 .",
    "follow - up observations of three of these dust - emitting qsos revealed co emission as well , with implied molecular gas masses of a @xmath8 m@xmath3 ( guilloteau et al .",

    "( 2001 ) argue that the dominant dust heating mechanism may be star formation based on the two simple points : ( i ) star formation is inevitable given the large dust and gas masses , and ( ii ) star formation is required to produce the large dust masses .",
    "the implied star formation rates are so extreme , @xmath9 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 year@xmath4 , that a significant fraction of the stars in the qso host galaxy can be formed on galaxian dynamical timescales .",
    "alternatively , sanders et al .",
    "( 1989 ) argue that radiation from the agn is the dominant dust heating mechanism , since in most cases it requires the absorption of only a small fraction ( @xmath10 ) of the agn uv luminosity .",
    "a possible means of addressing the question of dust heating by star formation vs. agn radiation is through radio observations .",
    "star forming galaxies at low redshift follow a very tight , linear correlation between radio continuum and fir luminosity ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "this correlation holds over four orders of magnitude in luminosity with only a factor two scatter around linearity for galaxy samples selected in the optical , ir , and radio . a general correlation between synchrotron radiation at cm wavelengths and thermal dust emission at ir wavelengths",
    "is expected , since both relate to massive star formation , however the tightness and linearity of the correlation remain puzzling . if this correlation holds to high redshift ( carilli and yun 1999 , 2000 ;",
    "yun et al . 2000 ) , then comparing cm and mm continuum luminosities is a possible diagnostic of star formation .    in this paper",

    "these radio observations are more sensitive than previous radio studies of high redshift qsos ( schmidt et al . 1995b ; stern et al . 2000 ) , and in particular , probe to levels that could indicate star formation , as dictated by the radio - to - fir correlation .",
    "we also consider the radio continuum morphologies and spectral indices in this regard .",

    "the noise level is significantly higher due to side - lobe confusion by bright sources within the primary beam of the telescope .",

    "the source j1646 + 5514 was observed at low elevation , leading to a highly elongated beam ( fwhm = @xmath21 , with a major axis position angle of 52@xmath22 ) , and a higher noise level due to ground pick - up .",

    "( 2000 ) for the br qsos in the sample of omont et al .",
    "( 1996a ) . further strong supporting evidence that the 250 ghz emission from these sources is thermal emission from warm dust comes from the fact that many of these sources have steeply rising spectra between 250 ghz and 350 ghz ( isaak et al .",

    "the weaker radio detections , and radio upper limits , lie within a factor of three of the radio quiet sed .",

    "hence , the ir emission constitutes @xmath82 of the bolometric luminosity for these galaxies , similar to low redshift , lower luminosity qsos .",
