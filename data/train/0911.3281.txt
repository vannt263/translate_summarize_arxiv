    "an astrophysical black hole ( bh ) can be entirely described by two parameters in general relativity , its mass _ m _ and a dimensionless spin , @xmath2 , which is 0 for a non - rotating schwarzschild bh and @xmath3 for a maximal kerr bh . unlike mass , spin only leaves an imprint on the spacetime very close to the event horizon , so it is much more difficult to measure . nonetheless , it is important to constrain because it is a fundamental parameter determining the structure of the spacetime around the bh .",
    "it sets the size  scale of the last stable orbit around the bh , from @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively , where @xmath6 .",
    "this determines the efficiency of conversion of mass to radiation for accreting objects , and may also determine the structure and power of relativistic jets . for bhs",
    "formed from stellar collapse then the resulting spin gives insight into the ( poorly understood ) supernovae event ( gammie , shapiro & mckinney 2004 ) and its gravitational wave signature .",
    "currently there are only two methods which can be used to determine spin from accreting bhs ( see reynolds & fabian 2008 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) . the first uses the luminosity and temperature of the optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disc to measure the emitting area of the inner disc , and hence its radius .",
    "this assumes that the dissipation follows that of the relativistic stress - free inner boundary condition ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) , an assumption which is now strongly supported by recent fully relativistic mhd simulations of thin discs with self - consistent magnetic turbulence as the origin of stress ( shafee et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to use this method",
    "requires that we can observe the spectrum at energies close to the peak temperature , which limits this method to stellar mass bh binaries ( hereafter bhbs ) , as agn discs typically peak in the unobservable far uv . additionally , the source distance , and disc inclination ( assumed to be the same as that of the binary )",
    "must be constrained , as these are necessary to transform the observed disc flux into luminosity .",
    "similarly , the bh mass is required to convert the resulting size scale into gravitational radii .",
    "thus this technique can only be used on a small subset of systems for which this information is available .",
    "further restrictions are that the systems should be _ dominated _ by the disc emission .",
    "the method can still be applied to data with an increasing fraction of emission in the power law tail , but with increasingly large uncertainties in reconstructing the temperature and luminosity of the disc emission ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; kubota & done 2004 ; done & kubota 2006 ; steiner et al .",
    "a final restriction is that the source should not be too bright as the disc structure may change at luminosities approaching and exceeding the eddington limit @xmath7 .",
    "the disc can puff up to become geometrically thick , advection and winds may become important , and the spectrum may also be increasingly distorted by low temperature comptonization which can be difficult to distinguish from disc emission ( e.g. grs 1915 + 105 : where middleton et al .",
    "2006 derive @xmath8 compared to @xmath9 from mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 due to differences in comptonisation assumptions ) .    within these limitations , the models including the full physics ( stress - free inner boundary condition , relativistic smearing , and modelling the non - blackbody intrinsic emission from each radial annulus ) are remarkably robust to changes in the disc vertical structure from different _ ad hoc _ stress prescriptions ( done & davis 2008 ) , and all the potential uncertainties act in the same direction which is for these models to overestimate the black hole spin ( gierliski & done 2004",
    "; done & davis 2008 ) .",
    "the second method to measure spin uses the shape of the iron line produced by fluorescence in the x - ray illuminated accretion disc .",
    "the width of the line is set by the line emissivity , together with the strength of the gravitational field as this determines the velocity of the disc ( hence the doppler shift , beaming and time dilation ) as well as gravitational redshift .",
    "all these parameters ( inclination , inner disc radius in terms of gravitational radii and emissivity ) can be constrained directly from spectral fitting , so this technique can be used much more widely than disc spectral fitting .",
    "its only restrictions are that the disc is flat and in keplarian rotation ( which again becomes increasingly uncertain at luminosities approaching / exceeding eddington ) and that there are sufficient hard x - rays illuminating the disc to produce the iron line .",
    "thus it can be used for both ( sub - eddington ) agns and bhbs and requires no additional information about the distance and/or inclination of the system ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "however , unlike the disc in the disc dominated spectra , the line is only a small feature on the total spectrum , which means it can be difficult to measure .",
    "the line sits on top of a reflected continuum , and the shape of both line and reflected continuum depend on ionisation of the material ( ross , fabian & young 2001 ) , and the radial and vertical profile of this ionisation ( nayakshin , kazanzas & kallman 2001 ; done & nayakshin 2007 ) .",
    "other key issues are the underlying continuum shape ( which can be distorted by complex absorption : l. miller et al . 2007 ; 2008 ) and disentangling the intrinsic shape of the blue wing of the line from any absorption lines from ionised iron k@xmath10 ( done & gierliski 2006 ; done & kubota 2006 ; young et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since we have two methods to measure spin it is obviously important to compare them .",
    "we would have increased confidence in both methods if they gave the same answer for the same object .",
    "however , the very different restrictions on the two techniques mean there is a very small set of objects where both can be used .",
    "disc dominated spectra generally have too few photons at the high energies required to produce a strong iron fluorescence line .",
    "similarly , disc spectral fitting can not be used on spectra with a strong tail ( carrying more than 25 per cent of the bolometric luminosity ) as the uncertainties in reconstructing the intrinsic disc emission become too large ( kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "thus the two methods can not be reliably compared using the same dataset ( but see miller et al .",
    "2009 for an attempt at this ) , but they can be used on the same object for a bhb with well constrained system parameters which shows spectral transitions .    to date",
    "only three objects have good spin estimates from both methods , where good is defined as derived from fits with the best currently available models i.e. bhspec for disc spectral fitting ( davis et al . 2005 ) and cdid for ionised reflection ( ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "the results are not encouraging .",
    "the spin estimates match well only for xte  j1550 - 564 , are somewhat discrepant for 4u  1543 - 475 , and are quite significantly different for gro  j1655 - 40 ( see section  [ s : compare ] ) .",
    "it is clearly important to expand the sample of objects for which this comparison can be made .",
    "gx 339@xmath04 is one of the best studied bhbs in terms of iron line profile from three separate data sets , spanning a range of spectral states ( miller et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ; 2008 ; reis et al .",
    "two of these datasets have issues with pileup , which distorts the line ( done & diaz - trigo 2010 ; yamada et al .",
    "2010 ) , but results from the third dataset alone indicate a very high spin , with @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending on the detailed emissivity profile , requiring @xmath13 or @xmath14 ( reis et al . 2008 ) and an inclination of @xmath15 .    here",
    "we apply the disc spectral fitting method and find that , despite the poorly known system parameters , such high spin is unlikely to match the observed temperature and luminosity of the disc dominated spectra from this source .",
    "measuring spin from disc spectral fitting requires that the system parameters ( mass , distance and inclination ) are reasonably constrained . without relativistic effects",
    ", the disc luminosity relates to the inclination via @xmath16 , where d is distance , f is the observed flux and @xmath17 is the area of the inner disc .",
    "thus @xmath18 . increasing @xmath19 and increasing inclination means larger @xmath20 and hence smaller spin .",
    "the binary parameters are more easily determined in x - ray quiescence , when the compact object is faint so that the secondary star can be seen .",
    "the spectral type then gives distance , while the ellipsoidal variations give the mass and inclination .",
    "alternatively , the mass and inclination can also be constrained from outburst data , by tracking periodic shifts in the line emission from the x - ray irradiated star ( casares 2007 ) .    for gx 339@xmath04 , the continuum from the secondary star can not be clearly seen even during quiescence but detection of the line emission in outburst gives a mass function of 5.8 @xmath21 0.5 @xmath22 ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter h03 ) .",
    "we review constraints on the mass , distance and inclination below , and then consider a representative selection of these values in order to explore their impact on the derived bh spin .",
    "since the distance can not be constrained by the companion star , it is instead estimated from the na d absorption along the line of sight to the source .",
    "this gives @xmath23  kpc , with distances as large as 15  kpc allowed , which would place gx 339@xmath04 on the far side of the galaxy ( hynes et al .",
    "zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( hereafter z04 ) , show that the na d absorption to gx 339@xmath04 is similar to that seen towards ob stars in the galactic bulge , so suggest that it is more likely that gx 339@xmath04 is at @xmath24  kpc . thus we take @xmath25  kpc as our range in distance , but this is probably too conservative as the companion star is likely to be seen at a distance of 6  kpc ( muoz - darias , casares & martinez - pais 2008 )    the mass function gives a lower limit to the mass of @xmath26 @xmath22 ( h03 ) . however , this is too conservative considering the companion star .",
    "this must fill its roche lobe , which is only possible with a long orbital period for a somewhat evolved star .",
    "muoz - darias , et al .",
    "( 2008 ) look in detail at these constraints , and argue for a stripped giant companion star with mass @xmath27 @xmath22 , giving a solid lower limit to the black hole mass of @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , the largest mass black hole in a low mass x - ray binary is grs 1915 + 105 at @xmath29 .",
    "thus we consider the range @xmath30 @xmath31 to be conservative , but note that @xmath32 @xmath31 is more likely .",
    "there is a strong constraint from the lack of eclipses that @xmath33 ( h03 ) .",
    "however , the long orbital period and consequent large disc mean that this source almost certainly has a strong equatorial disc wind in its high luminosity states .",
    "these give strong ionised absorption lines when viewed at high inclinations ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "there are ionised absorption features seen in gx 339@xmath04 , but these are much weaker than seen in the high inclination objects ( miller et al .",
    "this argues for an intermediate outer disc inclination , somewhat less than @xmath35 , but not so much lower that the equatorial wind does not intercept the line of sight .",
    "thus the outer disc ( which should have the same inclination as the binary orbit ) must have an inclination @xmath36 .",
    "the upper limit of this range is similar to the hard limit on the orbital inclination of @xmath37 that comes from putting the maximum bh mass of 15 @xmath31 into the h03 mass function with the minimum companion star mass of @xmath38 ( muoz - darias et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "however , it is the inner disc inclination which is important for determining spin , and this can be misaligned from the binary / outer disc if the bh spin is misaligned .",
    "there is a weak observational constraint on the inner disc inclination of @xmath39 from the fact that there are no high frequency qpos detected in this source ( schnittman , miller & homan 2006 ) , and a strong requirement from the iron line fits at @xmath40 ( miller et al .",
    "however , this would require a large misalignment angle of more than @xmath41 between the bh spin and orbit .",
    "such large misalignments can only be produced from a very asymmetric supernovae , and the resultant large kick is likely to unbind the orbit ( fragos et al .",
    "thus while we consider the range @xmath42 , the more likely lower limit is @xmath43 from the small misalignments required to form the binary ( fragos et al .",
    "2010 ) .      from the ranges given above , we select some example system parameter sets in order to illustrate the impact on derived spin . previous work on gx 339@xmath04 by gierliski & newton ( 2006 ) argued for 10 @xmath31 , @xmath44  kpc and @xmath45 ( hereafter termed gn06 ) , as this gave similar transition properties to other bhbs .",

    "( 2004 ) used 10 @xmath31 , @xmath24  kpc and @xmath46 ( hereafter termed z04 ) .",
    "the highest spin values will be found from the lowest @xmath19 so @xmath47 @xmath31 , @xmath44  kpc and lowest inclination , set to the more likely limit of @xmath43 ( hereafter termed max ) .",
    "however , we also consider a parameter set with @xmath48 for the minimum bh mass and distance of 5.8 @xmath31 , @xmath44  kpc ( hereafter termed h03 ) .",
    ".the parameter sets used in this paper .",

    "any lower mass and/or larger distance and/or higher inclination will give lower spin .",
    "there is a hard upper limit on spin of @xmath52 from the disc spectral fitting , assuming that the inner disc inclination is the same as that of the orbit .",
    "our upper limit is very conservative as it is quite unlikely that the system parameters are all at their extreme values , and in fact a distance of 6  kpc is inconsistent with a 15  @xmath31 black hole . at 6",

    "such a star has a low mass transfer rate , yet a large black hole requires a high mass transfer rate to keep the disc close to the borderline between quiescent and transient in order to trigger the multiple outbursts ( muoz - darias et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "there are three independent data sets for gx 339@xmath04 where the line profile has been modelled in detail ( miller et al .",

    "we take the most recent determinations , as these use the best current reflection models for black hole binary discs ( ross & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "the low / hard state xmm - newton mos data give an inner radius of @xmath53 , inclination @xmath54 ( no upper limit given ) with emissivity @xmath55 ( reis et al .",
    "suzaku observations of an intermediate state give @xmath56 ( i.e. spin of @xmath57 ) , inclination @xmath58 ( no upper limit given ) with emissivity @xmath59 ( miller et al .",
    "very high state xmm - newton burst mode pn data give a consistent inner radius and inclination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( no upper limit given ) .",
    "however , this requires a broken power law emissivity which changes from @xmath62 to @xmath63 at @xmath64 ( reis et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "however , two of these datasets have been challenged as being affected by instrumental pileup .",
    "this clearly affects the line determined from the xmm - newton mos low / hard state data , as the simultaneous pn timing mode ( which can handle much higher count rates without pileup ) data show a much narrower line ( done & diaz trigo 2009 ) . similarly the intermediate state _ suzaku _",
    "observation may also be affected by pileup ( yamada et al .",
    ". however , the pn burst mode very high state data are not affected by this .",
    "these give an equivalent spin of @xmath65 for @xmath58 and central emissivity of @xmath66 .",
    "thus there is a clear mismatch between the parameters derived from the iron line and those derived from disc spectral fitting in gx 339@xmath04 , even after excluding piled up data . the only possible way to make the two consistent are if the inner disc is seen at low inclination , so that it is misaligned from the binary orbit .",
    "this would also make it consistent with the low inclination of @xmath67 derived from the iron line fits .",
    "however , such a large misalignment could only come about from a very asymmetric supernovae , but the consequent natal kick is most likely to unbind the black hole from its binary companion , disrupting the system entirely ( fragos et al .",
    "this high spin is also inconsistent with the natal spins predicted from supernovae collapse models ( gammie et al .",
    "2004 ) , though these are poorly understood .",
    "while accretion does act to spin up the black hole , a low mass companion star of @xmath68 has insufficient mass to significantly increase the spin of a @xmath69 black hole ( king & kolb 1999 ) .",
    "we note that none of the spins derived from disc spectral fitting in low mass x - ray binaries are higher than @xmath70 except perhaps grs 1915 + 105 , with @xmath71 claimed by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . however , this depends on details of model assumptions for the comptonised spectrum , and can be as low as @xmath8 ( middleton et al .",
    "it seems premature to use contested results from this pathological source to challenge the supernovae collapse models .",
    "there are three additional sources where this comparison can be made .",

    "( 2006 ) and davis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "this means that 2/4 objects ( gx 339@xmath04 in this paper and gro j1655 - 40 : miller et al .",
    "2009 ) for which this comparison can be performed give a significantly larger black hole spin from iron line fitting than from the disc spectral method .",
    "the remaining 2 objects are marginally consistent , though taking the uncertainties at face value means that formally the spins from 4u  1543 - 475 are also marginally inconsistent but in the opposite sense ( disc fits give higher spin than the iron line ) .    which method ( if any ! )",
    "should we trust ?",
    "the disc spectrum is the dominant spectral component , and the derived disc parameters follow the predicted behaviour for a disc i.e. constant inner radius for changing mass accretion rate ( ebisawa et al . 1993 ; kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "by contrast , the iron line fits are to a small feature on the total spectrum ( which may have a much more complex form than the typical fit of disc plus power law and its reflection ) and often require a highly centrally concentrated line emissivity which is not consistent with the simplest expectations of disc illumination .",
    "thus we argue that the disc spectral fitting model results are more likely to be robust .",
    "we derive a hard upper limit for the spin of gx 339@xmath04 of @xmath52 assuming that the inner disc inclination is the same as that of the binary orbit ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the spin of @xmath65 and inclination of @xmath58 derived from the ( non - piled up ) xmm - newton burst mode very high state data ( reis et al .",
    "this high spin / low inclination derived from the iron line is already uncomfortably extreme compared to the lower spins predicted from supernovae collapse models , and the small misalignment angles between black hole spin and binary orbit predicted from binary formation models . while these are both potentially poorly understood , they are independent constraints and the iron line profile in gx 339@xmath04 conflicts with both of them .",
    "the iron line profile itself is in subtle conflict with the x - ray continuum as the reflection smearing parameters require that the illumination pattern is highly centrally concentrated ( miller et al .",
    "2008 ; reis et al .",
    "yet the very high state spectral shape requires that much of the inner disc is covered by optically thick comptonizing material , making it very difficult to see strong reflection from this material ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "thus we argue that the spin / inclination / emissivity derived from the iron line profile are uncomfortably extreme .",
    "it seems far more likely to us that the more moderate spin implied by the disc spectral fitting results where the inner disc is more or less aligned with the binary orbit are giving a more robust answer .",
    "the inescapable corollary to this is that there are systematic effects affecting spin as derived from the iron line profile that are not yet understood .",
