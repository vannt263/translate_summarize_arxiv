    "on 3 november 2000 in a seminar at cern the lep higgs working group presented preliminary results of an analysis indicating a possible 2.9@xmath0 observation of a 115 gev higgs boson @xcite . based on this analysis the four lep collaborations requested the continuation of lep to collect more data at @xmath1 gev . however , the arguments presented by the lep collaborations did not convince the lep management and in retrospect , it turned out that the lep accelerator turn - off date of 2 november 2000 ended its eleven years of forefront research .",
    "figure [ fig - masspeak ] , taken from the above mentioned presentation , shows the reconstructed mass distribution of the background and the signal ( on top of the background ) with the data represented by the dots with error bars .",
    "it is shown for three possible selections of the data samples with increasing signal purity .",
    "none of these distributions shows a clear classical 3@xmath0 excess of data over the expected background and some physicists claimed that this evidence was not convincing enough .",
    "however , the statistical arguments presented by the lep higgs working group were not based on these distributions , but rather on a sophisticated , though beautiful statistical analysis of the data .",
    "two years after the event , when the last analysis of the lep data indicated that the significance of a higgs observation in the vicinity of 115 gev went down to less than 2@xmath0 @xcite , it becomes apparent that the lep standard model ( sm ) higgs heritage will in fact be a lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "however , the lep higgs working group has taught us powerful and instructive lessons of statistical methods for deriving limits and confidence levels in the presence of mass dependent backgrounds from various channels and experiments .",
    "these lessons will remain with us long after the lower bound becomes outdated .    in this note",
    "we are trying to repeat , in a pedagogical way , this lep higgs statistical lesson . to achieve this we developed a toy monte carlo model containing a simulated background and signal similar to lep conditions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "due to mass resolution effects an event with a reconstructed mass @xmath3 can originate from any higgs mass in its vicinity . to appreciate the significance of a higgs candidate with respect to some test mass @xmath4 the event weights are introduced in section 2 .",
    "the weights of all candidate events are summed up in section 3 to give the likelihood of an experiment in order to quantify its signal - like nature .",
    "the probability density function of the likelihood is used in section 4 to estimate the probability of an experiment without a higgs boson to fluctuate and give a more signal - like outcome than the observed one or the probability of an experiment in the presence of a higgs signal to fluctuate and give a more background - like outcome than the observed one .",
    "confidence levels are introduced for that purpose .",
    "later on in that section , signal confidence levels are defined and used to estimate the exclusion sensitivity of an experiment .",
    "the current lep sm higgs search results are also given , allowing the reader to make his own appreciation and judgement .",
    "when does a higgs candidate event become significant ? what can be considered as a leading or gold plated higgs candidate ?",
    "due to detector resolution and missing energy carried by undetected neutrinos which accompany the higgs decay products , the reconstructed mass of a hypothetical higgs candidate @xmath3 , is not necessarily its physical mass , @xmath4 .",
    "one therefore defines a weight to quantify the significance of a higgs candidate with @xmath3 with respect to a hypothetical higgs with @xmath4 .",
    "this weight is given by @xmath5 ( see next section ) where @xmath6 is the expected number of signal events from an hypothetical higgs boson with a test mass @xmath4 in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in a series of plots ( figure [ fig - spaghetti ] ) . in this example",
    "we assume there is an event candidate with a reconstructed mass , @xmath7 gev .",
    "we then calculate the event weight for hypothetical higgs test masses in the range 100120 gev ( figs [ fig - spaghetti]a - e ) .",
    "the resulting weights are shown in the last figure of this series ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spaghetti]e ) .",
    "when connecting all the weights with a continuous line , one gets what has become to be known as the  spaghetti plot \" .",
    "also shown is the spaghetti plot for a candidate event with @xmath8 gev .",
    "as expected , the highest weight is achieved when the reconstructed mass and the hypothetical test higgs mass coincide .",
    "the 17 candidates with the highest weight at a test mass , @xmath9 gev are listed in table [ tab : event - list ] and their corresponding spaghetti plots are shown in figure [ fig - spaghetti - lep ] ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    ".properties of the candidates with the highest weight at @xmath10  gev .",
    "table is taken from @xcite .",
    "[ tab : event - list ] [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     where the background confidence level @xmath11 and the signal+background confidence level @xmath12 at @xmath13  gev , for all lep data combined and for various subsets of the data are shown .",
    "note that the delphi @xmath12 probability is 3.3% .",
    "that does not mean that delphi could exclude a 116 gev higgs boson signal hypothesis , but rather that delphi can exclude a 116 gev _",
    "_ s__+_b _ hypothesis .",
    "however , there is a @xmath14 probability for the delphi background to fluctuate and give a signal - like observation .",
    "it was to take this probability into account that one _ apriori defined _ the signal confidence level to be @xmath15 @xcite . this way the signal hypothesis for @xmath16 gev is excluded by definition at only the 73.8% confidence level , @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure for constructing the signal confidence level is obviously conservative since the coverage probability is in general greater than the @xmath18 .    of the three plots shown in figure [ fig - pdflep ]",
    "it is clear now that a 110 gev higgs boson , where the @xmath12 probability is too small to be seen , can be excluded by lep .",
    "this is also seen in table [ tab : clb ] where none of the experiments alone or the combined lep can exclude a 116 gev higgs boson .    the exclusion power of lep is illustrated in figure [ fig - exclusion ] @xcite where the median expected signal confidence level , @xmath19 , as a function of the higgs test mass together with its 1 and 2@xmath0 bands is shown .",
    "also shown is the observed @xmath20 confidence level .",
    "the intersection of the horizontal line at @xmath21 with the observed and median expected curves give the 95% observed and expected exclusion _",
    "cl_. thus lep excluded , at 95% _ cl _ , a sm higgs boson with a mass below 114.4 gev , while it had the sensitivity to exclude a 115.3 gev higgs boson .",
    "the small excess of data candidate events around 115116 gev is responsible for the slight reduction of the observed higgs lower mass limit with respect to its potential exclusion sensitivity .",
    "lep standard model higgs search results were reviewed with the emphasis on a pedagogical explanation of the statistical procedure based on a toy model constructed specifically for this purpose .",
    "we would like to thank moshe kugler , rick van kooten and alex read for their useful suggestions and illuminations after a critical reading of this note .",
    "one of the authors ( e.g. ) would like to thank the following people : peter zerwas for inviting him to summarize the lep higgs status in susy02 at desy hamburg , and thereby initiating this work ; alex read for teaching him everything he knows about higgs statistics , chris tully for giving him a private lep higgs statistics lesson and inbar mor for the good vibes and support while completing this work .",
