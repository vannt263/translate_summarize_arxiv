    "the modified pschl - teller potential @xmath0 , is one of the few exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics .",
    "it was first analyzed by rosen and morse @xcite , who found its energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "( this potential @xmath1 is indeed , an hyperbolic version of what is commonly known as the pschl - teller potential @xcite . )",
    "the system is characterized by a finite number of bound states whose spectrum depends on the parameters @xmath2 , plus a continuun of scattering states ( see in @xcite an elegant group approach ) ; the normalization of the wave functions has been obtained by nieto @xcite .",
    "barut  _ et al _ @xcite studied a three dimensional version of the problem ( with an additional term proportional to @xmath3 in the potential ) , and using the infeld - hull factorization @xcite they constructed ladder operators to determine the bound and scattering states from the matrix elements of group representations .",
    "it is well known that the modified pschl - teller potential appears in the solitary wave solutions of the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite , and also that it can be obtained from supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite as the susy partner of the free particle potential @xcite , being a non trivial example of unbroken supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "this potential can be considered as a type of short range potentials , almost vanishing over most of their domain , except near zero ( where the source resides ) .",
    "the extreme case of such short range potentials is the dirac delta well @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "delta potentials have been long used in field theories , where the main problem arises from the regularization and renormalization of the values for the physical observables predicted by the theory itself @xcite .",
    "the effects of adding a delta function potential on the states of a previously known potential have been computed exactly by atkinson @xcite for several physical systems .",
    "the one dimensional problem of @xmath6 particles interacting by means of delta potentials is one of the simplest many - body problems solved exactly ( see @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "as the delta potential @xmath7 is a distribution rather than a function , it can be approximated by different families of functions , one of them ( @xmath8 with an appropriate choice of the depth  @xmath9 ) will be investigated in this paper",
    ".    concerning the study of new exactly solvable problems in quantum mechanics , in the last years there has been remarkable progress along different lines : darboux transformation @xcite , infeld - hull factorization @xcite , mielnik factorization @xcite , susy quantum mechanics @xcite , and inverse scattering theory @xcite , among others .",
    "it is worth stressing that all of them can be embraced in an elegant algebraic approach named _ intertwining technique _",
    "@xcite , which has been successfully applied in the construction of higher order susy partners @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the intertwining has been also proved in the study and interpretation of black - hole perturbations in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze the susy partners associated with the modified pschl - teller and dirac delta potentials by using the intertwining technique . in section 2 , after a short review of results concerning both potentials , the properties of the latter are straighforwardly obtained as a limiting case of the former . in section 3",
    "we will determine closed expressions for two new families of susy partner potentials of pschl - teller , paying attention to the appearence of singularities ( in that case the isospectral properties should be considered under the point of view of @xcite ) . besides , the limit already mentioned in section 2 is carefully studied here for these two families , obtaining very different behaviour for each of them",
    ". a direct analysis of the susy delta potential is also carried out to check the validity of the previous limits .",
    "finally , in section 4 other varieties of pschl - teller susy potentials are shown to be easily obtained using higher order intertwining .",
    "let us consider the well known one - dimensional two - parametric modified pschl - teller potential @xcite , written in the following equivalent forms : @xmath10 henceforth , in all of the three versions , the following conditions are imposed in order to have an attractive potential : @xmath11 or @xmath5 .",
    "we also take for simplicity @xmath12 , and from the last equality the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related by @xmath15 the bound states ( @xmath16 ) for this potential can be obtained by using the traditional recipe of transforming the stationary schrdinger equation into an hypergeometric equation , with parameters @xmath17 the general solution is @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{solgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normalization condition on these eigenfunctions allows to determine the energy spectrum , which is found to be @xmath19 or just in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath14 : @xmath21 from ( [ spectrum ] ) and @xmath22 , the energy for @xmath23 always belongs to the spectrum of @xmath1 . calling @xmath24 the biggest possible value of @xmath25 in ( [ enpt ] ) , the total number of bound states is @xmath26 .",
    "from there , the following relationship between the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath24 holds @xmath27 if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , and there is just one bound state such that it has the lowest energy @xmath30 , and for which we have @xmath31 the corresponding normalized wave function turns out to be @xmath32 it is also interesting to remark that ( [ pt1param ] ) is a _ transparent _ potential ( _ i.e. _ the reflexion coefficient is equal to zero ) when the following condition is verified @xcite : @xmath33 using our notation this implies @xmath34 when @xmath35 we have the case of the free particle , which was excluded from the very begining .",
    "the last form of the potential @xmath8 given in ( [ pt1param ] ) can be directly related to the dirac delta potential @xmath36 just by taking the limit @xmath37 : @xmath38 as it is well known , this @xmath39-well has a unique bound state with eigenvalue @xmath40 and normalized wave function @xmath41 these results can be obtained directly from the modified pschl - teller potential by proving that the limiting relationship ( [ limiteadelta ] ) between both types of potentials is also inherited by their eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues .",
    "indeed , from the the pschl - teller ground state energy level ( [ ground ] ) we have @xmath42 a similar analysis can be done for the ground state eigenfunction ( [ groundfunc ] ) .",
    "observe that @xmath43 ; if @xmath44 , then the limit @xmath37 is equivalent to @xmath45 , hence it can be calculated from the asymptotic form of the function . to find it , we use @xmath46 and also the fact that , for @xmath47 , we have @xcite @xmath48 then , from ( [ ground ] ) and ( [ asymhypergeom ] ) , we have for @xmath49 @xmath50 in addition we have the following asymptotic behaviour for @xmath37 : @xmath51 .",
    "hence @xmath52 where @xmath53 . from ( [ groundfunc ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath54 , and then equation ( [ estadofundamental ] ) states the connection between ( [ groundfunc ] ) and ( [ deltafunc ] ) when the limiting relationship ( [ limiteadelta ] ) is satisfied .",

    "this property is also deduced from the pschl - teller potential by taking the limit @xmath37 in ( [ transparent2 ] ) , and using ( [ lambda ] ) , which gives the solution @xmath35 .",
    "let us consider now the problem of finding the supersymmetric partner of the modified pschl - teller potential @xmath1 .",
    "we look for a first order differential operator @xmath55 and a partner potential @xmath56 such that the following interwining relationship holds : @xmath57\\ , a= a\\ , \\left [ -   \\frac{d^2}{dx^2 } + v(\\alpha , x ) \\right ] .",

    "there is an immediate particular solution of equation ( [ riccpt ] ) in the form of an hyperbolic tangent , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 depending on @xmath20 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath64 in ( [ riccpt ] ) gives @xmath65 therefore , we have two different particular solutions of ( [ riccpt ] ) @xmath66 associated with two different factorization energies @xmath67 remark that these factorization energies can be formally identified with two values of the spectrum formula ( [ enpt ] ) : ^-=e_0,^+= e_-1 . [ epsilones ] then , the general solutions of the riccati equation ( [ riccpt ] ) for the above factorization energies can be found to be @xmath68 where @xmath69 are two new independent integration constants ; when they are taken to be zero , we recover the particular solutions @xmath70",
    ". it must be clear that , in fact , we have obtained two different families of intertwining operators @xmath71 generating two different families of susy partners ( [ firstvtilde ] ) of the potential ( [ pt1param ] ) .",
    "up to now , it has been usual to consider only the susy partners of a given potential constructed by taking particular solutions of the riccati equation @xcite . for the potential we are dealing with , the cases @xmath72 or @xmath73 give interesting results , and",
    "will be obtained just as byproducts of ( [ betaplusminus])([betaplusminus2 ] ) . in principle , it is possible to find solutions associated to other factorization energies , but they will produce very awkward expressions , without adding new relevant information to the problem we are dealing with .",
    "let us analyze now the results coming out when the general solutions ( [ betaplusminus])([betaplusminus2 ] ) are taken into account .",
    "observe that the integrals appearing there can be expressed in a closed form as @xmath74 this expression will be used next to construct the closed form of the susy partner potentials .      in this case",
    ", taking into account ( [ dpm ] ) and ( [ betaplusminus ] ) , we see that the exponent in ( [ laintegral ] ) is negative , indeed @xmath76 .",
    "the definite integral exist in the whole real axis , and in this case we can define the function @xmath77 a typical plot of @xmath78 is shown in figure  1 for general values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is quite clear that this function is odd in the variable @xmath80 , and it is monotonically increasing from its minimum value @xmath81 to its maximum value @xmath82 .",
    "it is interesting to remark the resemblance between the form of this function and that of the error function @xmath83 .",
    "we will immediately see that , indeed , for the pschl - teller problem , @xmath78 plays a role completely analogous to that played by the error function when determining the one - parametric family of susy partners of the harmonic oscillator potential @xcite .    if we introduce now the function @xmath84\\ ] ] we have for @xmath85 in ( [ betaplusminus ] ) the following expression : @xmath86 .",

    "\\label{vtildepluszeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that the singularities of @xmath88 correspond to the singular points of the function @xmath89 . it can be proved that this function is free of singularities in the following range of values of @xmath90 @xmath91 as we pointed out before , if we compare our results with the pioneering mielnik s work on the harmonic oscillator @xcite , one can appreciate that the roles played there by the error function and his parameter @xmath92 , are performed here by @xmath78 and the inverse of @xmath90 .",
    "the characteristic features of @xmath78 determine the existence of susy partner potentials wich are free of singularities , and are therefore almost isospectral to the modified pschl - teller potential .",
    "( a similar analysis can be done for an equivalent integral appearing in @xcite . )",
    "let us work now in this range of values of the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "the potential ( [ vtildepluszeta ] ) corresponds to the following family of almost isospectral hamiltonians @xmath93 it is well known that the eigenfunctions of @xmath94 can be constructed by acting with the operator @xmath95 of ( [ apm ] ) on the eigenfunctions @xmath96 of @xmath97 , which is factorized as @xmath98 and are given by @xmath99 , provided that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "there is also the possibility of an extra eigenfunction @xmath102 satisfying @xmath103 which will be called `` missing state '' .",
    "the first point we want to stress is that according to ( [ epsilones ] ) @xmath104 , wich is an energy level not allowed in the spectrum of the initial hamiltonian @xmath97 .",
    "hence , from ( [ hfactorizado ] ) it is clear that there is no eigenfunction @xmath105 of @xmath97 annihilated by @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the eigenfunctions of @xmath106 are given by the normalized functions @xmath107 plus the missing state solving ( [ missing ] ) , which properly normalized reads @xmath108 remark that the non - singularity condition ( [ dominioplus ] ) appears here again , although in this case it is required for the missing state to be normalizable .",
    "note also from ( [ widetildeh ] ) that @xmath102 is clearly the eigenfunction of @xmath106 with eigenvalue @xmath109 .",
    "this is the reason why we named it missing state .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath106 is given by the set @xmath110 plus a new level at @xmath104 .",
    "the conclusion is immediate : the family of potentials @xmath111 is not strictly isospectral to its susy partner @xmath8 : it has the same levels plus an additional one which is placed below all of them .",
    "let us remark that , due to the annihilation of the missing state @xmath112 in ( [ missingstate ] ) by the intertwiner @xmath95 , the missing state has no susy partner , and the couple of almost isospectral hamiltonians @xmath97 and @xmath113 corresponds to a case of unbroken susy .    in figure  2",
    "we plotted the asymmetric double well corresponding to the susy partner potential @xmath114 given by ( [ vtildepluszeta ] ) , with @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the three bound states of this potential are also represented with dotted horizontal lines .",
    "note that the potentials @xmath114 present features that makes them interesting for physical applications : ( i ) we are able to know their spectra in an exact form , and by adjusting the parameters we can have the desired number of bound states , and ( ii ) the shape of the potential can be modified to allow interesting tunnelling effects .",
    "let us consider now the limit @xmath37 of the potentials ( [ vtildepluszeta ] ) .",
    "there are two terms containing the function @xmath89 ; using ( [ asymhyperbol ] ) , ( [ asymhypergeom ] ) , and ( [ dominioplus ] ) , it can be easily proved that it has the following behaviour for large values of @xmath20 : @xmath118 giving a discontinuous function in the limit , but which is zero almost everywhere .",
    "in addition , the product @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the only relevant part in this potential would be that coming from the first term .",
    "but it diverges very badly as @xmath121 , and therefore we do not end with a physically interesting potential .",
    "the study of the other family of potentials coming out from ( [ betaplusminus2 ] ) can be done according to the lines already followed in the previous subsection .",
    "nevertheless , there are important differences between the results obtained in both cases .",
    "first of all , from equations ( [ dpm ] ) and ( [ betaplusminus2 ] ) , the exponent in ( [ laintegral ] ) is now positive : @xmath123 . as a consequence ,",
    "if we try to evaluate the integral in the whole real axis we get a divergent result .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to introduce a function similar to @xmath78 , let us call it @xmath124 this function is also odd and takes arbitrary positive values for @xmath125 and arbitrary negative values for @xmath126 . using the asymptotic behaviour of the hypergeometric functions ( [ asymhypergeom ] ) ,",
    "it is very easy to prove that the limit @xmath37 of ( [ l ] ) is @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the function sign of @xmath80 , and we have used the fact that @xmath20 , @xmath79 and @xmath14 are related through equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "we will use @xmath129 to define the function @xmath130 , \\label{omegaminus}\\ ] ] from which the following expression for @xmath131 in ( [ betaplusminus2 ] ) is obtained @xmath132 .",

    "+ 4\\alpha(\\lambda-1)\\xi\\ \\omega^-_\\xi(\\lambda,\\alpha , x)\\ , \\tanh \\alpha x   + 2 ( \\xi\\ \\omega^-_\\xi(\\lambda,\\alpha , x))^2 .",
    "\\label{vtildeminuszeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the behaviour of @xmath129 , it is quite clear that for any choice of @xmath134 the function @xmath135 presents a singular point , and therefore the potential @xmath122 is always singular , in contradistinction to the case of @xmath136 considered before .",
    "the presence of the singularity suggest that the results could be interpreted according to the method developed in @xcite : the susy partner potentials are not directly related by isospectrality to the original potential @xmath1 , but to a different problem consisting of this modified pschl - teller potential plus an infinite barrier potential placed precisely at the position where @xmath137 has its singular point .",
    "the case @xmath138 is interesting enough to be considered separately .",
    "it gives just the particular solution @xmath139 , which is free of singularities .",
    "the susy partner potentials  ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) correspond to a factorization energy @xmath140 , which according to ( [ epsilones ] ) is @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , there is an eigenstate @xmath142 of @xmath97 which is annihilated by the intertwining operator @xmath143 , and we can write @xmath144=   ( \\cosh \\alpha x)^{1-\\lambda},\\ ] ] which is precisely the square integrable function @xmath145 given in ( [ groundfunc ] ) , the ground state of @xmath97 . the eigenfunctions of @xmath146 are then given by @xmath147 in the present case the possible missing state solving ( [ missing ] ) would be @xmath148=   ( \\cosh \\alpha x)^{\\lambda-1}.\\ ] ] as @xmath149 , this function is not square integrable , and therefore it has not physical meaning as an eigenfunction of @xmath146 with eigenvalue @xmath140 . the spectrum of @xmath146 is given simply by @xmath150 . remark that , like in the previous case , this new hamiltonian is not either strictly isospectral to @xmath97 , although the reason is just the opposite : now the susy process eliminates one state of @xmath97 without creating a new one which can substitute it , while in the previous situation a new state was created , but keeping the initial spectrum .",
    "hence , we have another example of unbroken susy encoded in the spectrum of the couple @xmath97 and @xmath151 .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the limit of the previous results for @xmath37 , in order to do that , we first analize the asymptotic behaviour of the factorization energy ( [ epsilonpm ] ) : @xmath152 for @xmath153 the susy potential @xmath139 in ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) is always attractive ; on the other hand , when @xmath154 the potential becomes always repulsive ; finally , when @xmath155 the potential vanishes identically .",
    "this change on the character atractive or repulsive of @xmath139 according to the values of @xmath20 has a _ strong _ physical meaning .",
    "it is related to the fact that in the susy process , the ground state level @xmath30 is eliminated from the spectrum of @xmath146 , being always a member of the spectrum of @xmath97 , irrespectively of the value of @xmath20 . in particular , when @xmath154 the potential @xmath1 has only this bound state ( see coment after equation ( [ enpt ] ) ) , and therefore , in the same interval the new potential @xmath156 has not bound state at all .    in figure  3",
    "we plotted three members of the original family ( [ pt1param ] ) of modified pschl - teller potentials @xmath1 ( the three thicker curves ) , and also , in the same type of lines , but thinner , their corresponding susy partner potentials @xmath157 given by ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters are indicated in the caption .",
    "remark that although the initial modified pschl - teller potentials are always negative , their susy potentials are less negative ( in the case of the dotted line ) or become even positive ( as in the cases of dashed and solid curves ) .",
    "an important detail to be stressed is that in the limit @xmath37 the potential @xmath157 of ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) has a well defined behaviour ( unlike the situation for @xmath158 ) : it becomes the delta barrier @xmath159 it is quite remarkable the difference with the limit of the initial potential @xmath1 , which was a delta well , as it has been shown in equation ( [ limiteadelta ] ) .",
    "another interesting point to be considered is the analysis of the limit @xmath37 of ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) , which can be evaluated even for the case @xmath134 .",
    "we already have all the information needed to write down this result , indeed : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , plus equations ( [ deltaparriba ] ) , ( [ limitl ] ) , and ( [ omegaminus ] ) .",
    "we get the following : @xmath162 \\lim_{\\alpha\\to\\infty } { \\widetilde v}_\\xi^- ( \\alpha , x )   \\!\\!&\\!\\ ! = \\!\\!&\\!\\ !",

    "after the limit process , we obtain a function with three different discontinuities :    1 .",
    "the function blows up like @xmath163 at the singular point @xmath164 2 .   at the origin",
    ", we get a divergence of the type @xmath165 .",
    "3 .   there is a finite jump discontinuity at the origin , due to the presence of the sign function in ( [ limitvminustodelta ] ) .",
    "this discontinuity is concealed by the presence of the superposed dirac delta centred also at @xmath166 .",
    "these remaks are clearly illustrated on figure  4 , where we have plotted the limit case ( without the delta distribution at the origin ) , plus one intermediate case .",
    "the dotted curve represents the plot of one of the susy partners of the modified pschl - teller potential ( [ vtildeminuszeta ] ) , for the following values of the parameters : @xmath167 , @xmath168 ( or equivalently @xmath169 ) , @xmath170 .",
    "the solid curve represents the susy dirac delta potential for @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and it is a limiting case of the dotted curve when @xmath37 ( the delta contribution comes out from the dotted hump ) .      let us consider now the intertwining relationship ( [ intertw ] ) for the hamiltonian associated with the dirac delta well potential @xmath36 .",
    "equations ( [ firstvtilde ] ) and ( [ riccpt ] ) also hold , with @xmath171 as the known potential and the potential @xmath172 to be determined .",
    "the relevant riccati equation to be solved is now @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the factorization energy in this case .",
    "remark that from the mathematical point of view it is a differential equation which includes a distribution .",
    "therefore the solution could have some discontinuity .",
    "it is possible to find a particular solution of ( [ riccdelta ] ) , for a particular value of the constant @xmath174 , in terms of the sign function , indeed @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",
    "this function satisfies the differential equation almost everywhere , _",
    "i.e. _ , for every real value of @xmath80 , except for @xmath166 .",
    "then , the general solution can be found by using the standard technique of transforming the nonlinear riccati differential equation into a linear one .",
    "the final result is the following : @xmath177 but this is precisely the result previously obtained in ( [ limitbetaminustodelta ] ) if we identify the two parameters @xmath178 .",
    "obviously , the potential coming out from this function will be exactly the same as ( [ limitvminustodelta ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have been able to obtain also the general susy partners of the dirac delta distribution as a byproduct of the general results derived for the modified pschl - teller potential in the previous section .",
    "we would like to insist on the fact that in the singular potential case ( @xmath134 ) the susy problem is related to a modification of the initial potential resulting from adding an infinite barrier placed at the singularity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us comment now a little bit more on the results for the dirac delta susy partners .",
    "on one side , the particular case obtained from ( [ limitvminustodelta ] ) by making @xmath73 @xmath179 is in complete agreement with some already well known results @xcite . on the other side , the general solution ( @xmath134 ) presented in ( [ limitvminustodelta ] )",
    "can be compared with a result recently published @xcite .",
    "some discrepancies can be appreciated between the results derived in this last paper and ours .",
    "observe that the connection we have established between our results for the modified pschl - teller and dirac delta potentials strongly supports the validity of our new susy partners for the delta .",
    "finally , we would like to stress one of the main results : the susy partners and all the relevant information for the dirac delta potential can be obtained taking the limit in the corresponding expressions for the pschl - teller case , due to the good behaviour of the limiting procedures .",
    "one remarkable difference is that for the delta potential there is just one susy partner ( indeed , only one specific value of the factorization energy @xmath174 allows to obtain the solution of the riccati equation ( [ riccdelta ] ) ) , in contrast to the analysis done for the modified pschl - teller potentials , where two different factorization energies @xmath180 were found .",
    "the higher order susy partners can be also determined for the potentials we considered before . concerning this topic ,",
    "it has been recently developed a handy technique using difference equations in order to construct multi - parametric families of isospectral potentials @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall comment briefly only on the results derived following this approach for the potentials we are dealing with in the 2susy case . in the first susy step we use the factorization constant @xmath109 and in the second step we use @xmath140 (",
    "the same final second order susy results are obtained if the process is accomplished in the reverse order ) .",
    "hence , the 2susy potential is given by @xmath181 where @xmath1 is the initial modified pschl - teller potential ( [ pt1param ] ) , @xmath180 are given by ( [ epsilonpm ] ) , and @xmath182 , @xmath183 by ( [ betapluszeta ] ) and ( [ betaminusxi ] ) , respectively .",
    "the 2susy partner depends on the two parameters @xmath90 and @xmath184 .",
    "this family embraces a wide variety of potentials , one of the most interesting cases is obtained by taking only the particular solutions @xmath185 : @xmath186 this kind of solution is a particular case of a more general form of the modified pschl - teller potential used in some of the papers already mentioned @xcite @xmath187 precisely for the value @xmath188 .",
    "note that ( [ 2susy ] ) has not a well defined limit when @xmath37 , and therefore it is not possible to find a 2susy partner for the dirac delta connected with a 2susy partner of the modified pschl - teller potential .",
    "observe that this fact was implicit from the begining , because only one factorization energy @xmath174 was found for the @xmath39 , while for the modified pschl - teller we were able to find two different factorization energies @xmath109 , @xmath140 .",
    "due to the relevance of solvable susy quantum mechanical models as toy examples for higher dimensional quantum field theories , and also for their use in solid state physics , we analized in detail the supersymmetry associated with the modified pschl - teller potential , which appears in many interesting physical situations , for example in the nonrelativistic limit of the sine - gordon equation , in connection with a two - body force of dirac delta type , when studying integrable many - body systems in one dimension , or when considering two - dimensional susy quantum field theories .    in the present work we have constructed two new one - parametric families of exactly solvable potentials @xmath136 and @xmath137 related to the modified pschl - teller potential @xmath1 by the one - parametric superpotentials @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "they represent two different cases of unbroken supersymmetry , and they reduce to some previously published results for @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "a relevant trait of our results is that , for specific values of @xmath90 and @xmath20 , the members of the family @xmath136 are free of singularities , which is , as far as we know , a fact unnoticed in the literature . on the other hand",
    ", the family @xmath137 , with @xmath134 , embraces only singular potentials which have to be considered very carefully , because they are not susy partners of the initial potential ( [ pt1param ] ) , but of the initial potential plus an infinite barrier at the singularity @xcite .",
    "the connection between the modified pschl - teller and dirac delta potentials was established , and we were able to construct the susy partner of the delta potential .",
    "the main remark is that only the singular family @xmath137 can be used to approximate an atractive delta potential in terms of the limiting procedure discussed in the paper .",
    "the explanation can be given in terms of the susy process : our particular solution of the riccati equation ( [ riccdelta ] ) represents the superpotential @xmath191 usually derived for the atractive delta potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , the susy partner potential of the dirac delta well is a dirac delta barrier and , because this last potential has not bound states , the corresponding susy system has to present unbroken susy ; in other words , the susy process eliminates the only bound state of the delta well in order to satisfy the witten index condition for unbroken susy .",
    "the same holds for the case @xmath192 .",
    "the energy level at @xmath141 is destroyed and it does not play any role in the limit @xmath37 for the spectrum of @xmath137 ( remember that @xmath193 ) . as the other energy levels dissapear , from the spectrum of @xmath194 when taking this limit ,",
    "then the final potential has not bound states .",
    "the result is in complete agreement with the direct calculation . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the situation is different because the ground energy level @xmath109 diverges as @xmath195 when @xmath37 , and the potential has not a physically interesting limit .",
