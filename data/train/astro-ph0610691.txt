    "the release of the third year data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) has further improved the precision with which we can constrain the cosmological parameters from the shape of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the _ planck _ satellite , scheduled for launch in 2008  @xcite , will provide even higher precision @xmath5 values and data down to smaller angular scales ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "higher precision in the observations requires increased accurarcy from the theoretical calculations , in order for the correct cosmological parameters to be extracted .",
    "it now seems crucial to obtain the @xmath5s down to at least the 1 percent level over a wide range of @xmath8 .",
    "cmbfast  @xcite is the most commonly used boltzmann code for calculating the @xmath5s , and it gives consistent results with other independent codes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in obtaining accurate @xmath5s comes from details in the physics of recombination , for example , the ` fudge factor ' in the recfast routine  @xcite .",
    "calculations of cosmological recombination were first published by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the most detailed multi - level calculation and introduced a fudge factor to reproduce the results within an effective three - level model .",
    "although the multi - level calculation already gives reasonable accuracy , the required level of accuracy continues to increase , so that today any effect which is @xmath91 per cent over a range of multipoles is potentially significant .",
    "several modifications have been recently suggested to give per cent level changes in the ionization fraction and/or the @xmath5s ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "most of these modifications have been calculated only with an effective three - level code , and so the results may be different in the multi - level calculation , since there is no thermal equilibrium assumed between the upper states . here",
    "we want to focus on one of these modifications , namely the extra forbidden transitions proposed by @xcite , which we study using a multi - level code .    in the standard calculations of recombination",
    ", one considers all the resonant transitions , but only one forbidden transition , which is the 2s1s two - photon transition , and this can be included for both h and he .",
    "@xcite suggested that one should also include the two - photon transitions from higher excited s and d states to the ground state for h and hei , and also the spin - forbidden transition between the triplet @xmath10p@xmath11 and singlet ground state @xmath12s@xmath13 for hei .",
    "they showed that the recombination of both h and hei sped up in the three - level atom model .",

    "it is hard to find published accurate and complete data for the photo - ionization cross - section of hei with large @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite evaluated @xmath59 and @xmath60 by including the non - resonant transitions through the higher - lying intermediate @xmath0p states ( @xmath0@xmath56@xmath61 ) , which are equal to 8.2197s@xmath54 and 0.13171s@xmath54 , respectively .",
    "these values were confirmed by @xcite and agreed to three significant figures . using these values",

    "the approximation given by @xcite therefore seems to be an overestimate .",
    "this leads us instead to consider a scaled rate @xmath62 , which is equal to @xmath50 multiplied by a factor to bring the approximated two - photon rates of h ( equation  ( 5 ) ) with @xmath0@xmath273 into agreement with the numerical value given above , i.e. @xmath63    note that the use of the non - resonant rates is an approximation .",
    "the resonant contributions are suppressed in practice because of optical depth effects , and in a sense some of these contributions are already included in our multi - level calculation .",

    ". therefore , one should also consider these two - photon transitions with for hei , and the precise result will require the use of accurate rates , rather than an approximate formula such as equation  ( 7 ) . for the @xmath77@xmath78 transition , @xcite adopted an older and slightly larger rate , and this causes a larger change of the ionization fraction ( about 0.5 per cent more compared with that calculated with our best rate ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gdxe23p ] .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one might wonder why the semi - forbidden transitions are significant in recombination _ at all _",
    ", since the spontaneous rate ( or the einstein @xmath67 coefficient ) of the semi - forbidden transitions are about 6 orders of magnitude ( a factor of @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the fine - sturcture constant ) smaller than those of the resonant transitions .",
    "let us take hei as an example for explaining the importance of the spin - forbidden @xmath77@xmath78 transition in recombination .",
    "the spontaneous rate is equal to 177.58s@xmath54 for this semi - forbidden transition , which is much smaller than @xmath97s@xmath54 for the @xmath98@xmath78 resonant transition .",
    "but when we calculate the net rate [ see equation  ( 8) ] , we also need to include the effect of absorption of the emitted photons by the surrounding neutral atoms , and we take this into account by multiplying the net bound - bound rate by the sobolev escape probability @xmath99  @xcite . if @xmath99=1 , the emitted line photons can escape to infinity , while if @xmath99=0 the photons will all be reabsorbed and the line is optically thick .",
    "[ gescp ] shows that the escape probability of the @xmath98@xmath78 resonant transition is about 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the spin - forbidden transition .",
    "this makes the two net rates roughly comparable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gratehei ] . from equation",
    "( 11 ) , we can see that the easier it is to emit a photon , the easier that photon can be re - absorbed , because the optical depth @xmath75 is directly proportional to the einstein @xmath67 coefficient .",
    "so when radiative effects dominate , it is actually natural to expect that some forbidden transitions might be important ( although this is not true in a regime where collisonal rates dominate which is often the case in astrophysics ) .",
    "in fact for today s standard cosmological model , slightly more than half of all the hydrogen atoms in the universe recombined via a forbidden transition  @xcite .",
    "table  1 shows that this is also true for helium .",
    "in the previous multi - level calculation  @xcite , there was no direct transition between the singlet and triplet states .",
    "the only communication between them was via the continuum , through the photo - ionization and photo - recombination transitions .",
    "table  1 shows how many electrons cascade down through each channel from @xmath100 states to the ground state . in the previous calculation , about 70% of the electrons went down through the @xmath98@xmath78 resonant transition . in the new calculation ,",
    "including the spin - forbidden transition between the triplets and singlets , there are approximately the same fraction of electrons going from the @xmath98 and @xmath77 states to the ground state  ( actually slightly more going from @xmath10p@xmath11 in the current cosmological model ) .",
    "this shows that we should certainly include this forbidden transition in future calculations .",
    "our estimate is that only about 40% of helium atoms reach the ground state without going through a forbidden transition .",
    "how about the effect of other forbidden transitions in hei recombination ?",
    "we have included all the semi - forbidden electric - dipole transitions with @xmath0@xmath25@xmath101 and @xmath8@xmath25@xmath102 , and with oscillator strengths larger than @xmath103 given by @xcite  ( private communication ) .",
    "there is no significant change found in the ionization fraction .",
    "besides the @xmath10p@xmath11@xmath78 transition , all the other extra semi - forbidden transitions are among the higher excited states where the resonant transitions dominate .",
    "this is because these transition lines are optically thin and the escape probabilities are close to 1 .",
    "the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xmath104 depends on the detailed profile of the evolution of the ionization fraction @xmath4 .",
    "this determines the thickness of the photon last scattering surface , through the visibility function , where @xmath105 is the thomson scattering optical depth .",
    "the function @xmath106 sets the epoch when the tight coupling between baryons and photons breaks down , i.e. when the photon diffusion length becomes long , and the visibility function fixes the time when the fluctuations are effectively frozen in  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the addition of the extra forbidden transitions speeds up both the recombination of h and he  i , and hence we expect that there will be changes in @xmath5 .    in order to perform the required calculation ,",
    "we have used the code cmbfast  @xcite and modified it to allow the input of an arbitrary recombination history .",
    "[ gcltt ] and [ gclee ] show the relative changes in the cmb temperature ( _ tt _ ) and polarization ( _ ee _ ) anisotropy spectra , respectively , with different combinations of extra forbidden transitions .",

    ", there is less @xmath4 at @xmath16@xmath57@xmath107 , which leads to an ealier relaxation of tight coupling .",
    "therefore , both the photon mean free path and the diffusion length are longer .",
    "moreover , the decrease of @xmath4 in the high-@xmath16 tail results in increased damping , since the effective damping scale is an average over the visibility function .",
    "this larger damping scale leads to suppression of the high-@xmath8 part of the power spectrum . from figs .",
    "[ gcltt ] and [ gclee ] , we can see a decrease of @xmath5 ( for both _",
    "tt _ and _ ee _ ) toward high @xmath8 for hei , with the maximum change being about 0.6 percent .    for h ,",
    "the change of @xmath5 is due to the decrease in @xmath4 at @xmath16@xmath57@xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ gdxe ] ) .",
    "there are two basic features in the curve of change in @xmath104 ( the dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ gcltt ] ) .",
    "firstly , the power spectrum is suppressed with increasing @xmath8 , due to the lower @xmath4 in the high-@xmath16 tail ( @xmath16@xmath911000 ) .",
    "secondly , there are a series of wiggles , showing that the locations of the acoustic peaks are slightly shifted .",
    "this is due to the change in the time of generation of the @xmath5s in the low-@xmath16 tail .",
    "@xmath109 actually shows an increase for @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ gclee ] ) ; this is caused by the shift of the center of the visibility function to higher @xmath16 , leading to a longer diffusion length .",
    "polarization occurs when the anisotropic hot and cold photons are scattered by the electrons .",
    "the hot and cold photons can interact with each other within the diffusion length , and therefore , a longer diffusion length allows more scatterings and leads to a higher intensity of polarization at large scales .    with the approximate rates used by  @xcite , the maximum relative change of @xmath111 is about 4 percent and for @xmath109 it is about 6 percent .",
    "the overall change is thus more than 1 percent over a wide range of @xmath8 . however , if we adopt the scaled two - photon rate given by equation  ( 6 ) , the relative changes of @xmath111 and @xmath109 are no more than 1 per cent .",
    "note that we do not plot the temperature - polarization correlation power spectrum here , since there is no dramatically different change found ( and relative differences are less meaningful since @xmath112 oscillates around zero ) .",
    "in our model we only consider the semi - forbidden transitions with @xmath0@xmath2510 and @xmath8@xmath257 for hei and the two - photon transitions from the higher s and d states to the ground state for h and hei",
    ". it would be desirable to perform a more detailed investigation of all the other forbidden transitions , which may provide more paths for the electrons to cascade down to the ground state and speed up the recombination process . in this paper",
    "we have tried to focus on the forbidden transitions which are likely to be the most significant .",
    "however we caution that , if the approximations used are inadequate , or other transitions prove to be important , then our results will not be accurate .",
    "there are several other approximations that we have adopted in order to perform our calculations .",
    "for example , we consider the _ non - resonant _ two - photon rates for higher excited rates .",
    "the two - photon transitions from higher excited states ( @xmath0@xmath563 ) to the ground state are more complicated than the 2s1s transition , because of the resonant intermediate states .",
    "for example , for the 3s1s two - photon transition , the spectral distribution of the emitted photons shows infinities ( resonance peaks ) at the frequencies corresponding to the 3s2p and 2p1s transitions  @xcite . here",
    ", we use only the non - resonant rates , by assuming a smooth spectral distribution of the emitted photons ; this probably gives a lower limit on the change of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coming from these extra forbidden transitions . the correct way to treat",
    "this would be to consider the rates and feedback from medium using the full spectral distribution of the photons and radiative transfer ; this will have to wait for a future study .",
    "besides the consideration of more forbidden transitions , there are many other improvements that could be made to the recombination calculation .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that a multi - level calculation of the recombination of h with the inclusion of seperate @xmath8-states can give more than 20 per cent difference in the population of some levels compared with the thermal equilibrium assumption for each @xmath0-shell .",
    "the latest calculation , considering up to 100 shells , is presented by  @xcite , but does not include all the forbidden transitions studied here .",
    "a more complete calculation should be done by combining the forbidden transitions in a code with full angular momentum states , and we leave this to a future study .",
    "there are also other elaborations which could be included in future calculations , which we now describe briefly .",
    "the rate equation we use for all the two - photon transitions only includes the spontaneous term , assuming there is no interaction with the radiation background ( see equation  ( 3 ) ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that one should also consider the stimulated effect of the 2s1s two - photon transition for h , due to photons in the low frequency tail of the cmb blackbody spectrum .",
    "@xcite additionally argued that the change of the adiabatic index of the matter should also be included , arising due to the neutralization of the ionized gas .",
    "these two modifications have been studied only in an effective three - level atom model , and more than a percent change in @xmath4 was claimed in each case  ( but see  @xcite for arguments against the effect claimed by leung et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for the background radiation field @xmath79",
    ", we approximated it with a perfect blackbody planck spectrum .",
    "this approximation is not completely correct for the recombination of h , since the he line distortion photons redshift into a frequency range that can in principle photo - ionize the neutral h  @xcite .",
    "althought we expect this secondary distortion effect to bring the smallest change on @xmath4 among all the modifications suggested here , it is nevertheless important to carry out the calculation self - consistently , particularly for the spectral line distortions .",
    "in order to obtain an accurate recombination history , we therefore need to perform a full multi - level calculation with seperate @xmath8-states and all the improvements suggested above , which we plan to do in a later paper .    for completeness",
    "we also point out that the accuracy of the physical constants is important for recombination as well .",
    "the most uncertain physical quantity in the recombination calculation is the gravitational constant @xmath113 .",
    "the value of @xmath113 used previously in the recfast code is @xmath114@xmath115@xmath116m@xmath117kg@xmath54s@xmath118 and the latest value ( e.g. from the particle data group , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath119@xmath115@xmath116m@xmath117kg@xmath54s@xmath118 .",

    "the change in @xmath4 is no more than 0.5 per cent . including these extra forbidden transitions , the change in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum is more than 1 per cent , which will potentially affect the determination of cosmological parameters in future cmb experiments . since one would like the level of theoretical uncertainty to be negligible , it is essential to include these forbidden transitions in the recombination calculation .",
    "in addition , we still require accurate spontaneous rates to be calculated for the two - photon transitions and also a code which includes at least all the modifications suggested in section  4 , in order to obtain the @xmath5s down to the 1 per cent level .",
    "achieving sub - percent accuracy in the calculations is challenging !    however , the stakes are high  the determination of the parameters which describe the entire universe  and",
    "so further work will be necessary .",
    "systematic deviations of the sort we have shown would potentially lead to incorrect values for the spectral tilt derived from planck and even more ambitions future cmb experiments , and hence incorrect inferences about the physics which produced the density perturbations in the very early universe .",
    "it is amusing that in order to understand physics at the @xmath125gev energy scale we need to understand ev scale physics in exquisite detail !",
    "this work would have been impossible without the earlier discussions with sara seager .",
    "we thank donald c. morton for useful conversations and providing us with updated forbidden transition rates .",
    "we are grateful to peter j. storey for providing the data for the photo - ionization cross - section of neutral helium .",
    "we would also like to thank alexander dalgarno , victor k. dubrovich , christopher hirata and eric switzer for useful discussions .",

    "<S> more than half of the atoms in the universe recombined via forbidden transitions , so that accurate treatment of the forbidden channels is important in order to follow the cosmological recombination process with the level of precision required by future microwave anisotropy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a multi - level calculation of the recombination of hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) with the addition of the spin - forbidden transition for neutral helium ( hei ) , plus the @xmath0s1s and @xmath0d1s two - photon transitions for h ( up to @xmath1 ) and among singlet states of hei ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the potential importance of such transitions was first proposed by @xcite using an effective three - level atom model . here </S>",
    "<S> , we relax the thermal equilibrium assumption among the higher excited states to investigate the effect of these extra forbidden transitions on the ionization fraction @xmath4 and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) angular power spectrum @xmath5 . the spin - forbidden transition brings more than a percent change in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon transitions may also give non - negligible effects , but currently accurate rates exist only for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that changes in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 would be at about the percent level with the approximate rates given by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the two - photon rates from 3s to 1s and 3d to 1s of h appear to have been overestimated , and our best numerical calculation puts the effect on @xmath4 and @xmath5 at below the percent level . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we do not claim that we have the definite answer , since several issues remain open ; sub - percent level computation of the @xmath5s requires improved calculations of atomic transition rates as well as increasingly complex multi - level atom calculations .    </S>",
