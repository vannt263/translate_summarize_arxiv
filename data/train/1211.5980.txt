    "astrophysical systems provide an ideal scenario to examine the effects of strong magnetic fields associated with self  gravitating sources under critical conditions . in such conditions ,",
    "we expect non  trivial coupling between gravitation and other fundamental interactions ( strong , weak and electromagnetic ) , and from this interplay important clues of their unification could emerge .",
    "the presence and effects of strong magnetic fields in compact objects ( neutron , hybrids and quark stars ) have been studied in the literature ( see @xcite , and references quoted therein ) , assuming various types of equations of state ( eos ) has been obtained and considering in some of these papers numerical solutions of the equilibrium tolman  oppenheimer ",

    "evidently , a bianchi i model is a completely inadequate metric for any sort of a compact object , as all geometric and physical variables depend only on time ( and thus it can not incorporate any coupling of gravity with spatial gradients of these variables ) .",
    "however , the use of this idealized geometry could still be useful to examine qualitative features of the local behavior of the magnetized gas under special and approximated conditions .",
    "specifically , we aim at providing qualitative results that could yield a better understanding of the conditions approximately prevailing near the center and the rotation axis of less idealized configurations , where the angular momentum of the vorticity and the spatial gradients of the 4acceleration and other key variables play a minor dynamical role .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to include the effect of the temperature in the study that we accomplished in @xcite .",
    "we aim at addressing the question of whether a finite temperature produces a significant dynamical effect in `` slowing down '' or reversing the evolution of the magnetized gas in the collapsing regime , as such qualitative difference may be related to the stability of the self  gravitating configuration .",

    "in contrast , for high initial temperatures , the system is heated as the collapse proceeds , with the magnetization behaving monotonically with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "these results agree with the study performed in @xcite , where the authors expressed the magnetization of an electron gas at finite temperature as the sum of two terms : one oscillatory and the other monotonic , which predominate at respectively low and high temperatures .    on the other hand , the energy density increases with the temperature for the initial value @xmath141 , which does",
    "not occurs for the initial value @xmath136 .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization and the energy density can be explained by taking into account that for the initial value @xmath136 , as we discussed above , the system is cooled ( temperature decreases ) during the collapse process with an increasing magnetic field .",
    "this is an indication that the effects of the magnetic field ( alignment of electron spins with the magnetic field ) predominate over the effects of temperature ( random motion ) in the system , a situation in which the haas ",
    "van alphen oscillations appear in the magnetization curves , with energy density decreasing with temperature in the collapse process . on the other hand , for high initial temperatures ( @xmath141 ) ,",
    "the system is heated ( temperature increases ) during the collapse , which shows the predominance of the effect of temperature over the effect of the field , and showing the magnetization and the energy density following a monotonic behavior with respect to the magnetic field and the temperature , respectively .",
    "that is to say , when @xmath155",
    "the temperature of the system decreases in the collapse process , while the magnetic field increases and the gas evolves to strong magnetic field regimen , where the effect of the temperature is negligible in a first approximation .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath156 , for which the temperature rises significantly during the collapse and its effects are significant .",
    "it is worthwhile commenting on the relation between the temperature , magnetic field and magnetization in magnetized gases . in an `` earth",
    "bound '' context when the gas is not self  gravitating , the magnetic field acts as an `` external '' agent whose effect is to increase the magnetization by aligning the magnetic moments of the electrons . for higher temperatures the internal energy increases and",
    "there is more resistance to this effect , resulting in a relatively low magnetization with the electron magnetic moments alignment being relatively random , while at lower temperatures the opposite effect occurs : magnetization is high and magnetic moments strongly align with the magnetic field .",
    "however , for a self  gravitating gas the magnetic field is no longer `` external '' , but generated by the electron magnetic moments themselves , hence the relation between these variables can not be controlled : it emerges from the dynamics of the gas and depends on the interplay of initial conditions .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : disc1 ] , a large magnetization coincides with a large magnetic field for relatively low temperatures .",
    "the figure displays the plot of magnetization @xmath9 for initial temperatures @xmath157 and @xmath158 , @xmath159 ( vertical axis in the left hand side ) and @xmath160 ( vertical axis in the right hand side ) vs magnetic field @xmath161 .",
    "we considered initial magnetic field @xmath119 and a positive value for the initial shear component along the @xmath7 axis ( the same value as in the plot of @xmath162 in figure [ fig : g2 ] ) .",
    "the plots show that larger values for the magnetization correspond to lower temperatures .",
    "the case with zero initial shear is displayed in figure [ fig : g4].,width=377 ]    it is important to recall that the study we have undertaken here is based on an equation of state and a thermodynamical potential ( @xmath163 ) that come from a one - loop approximation .",
    "the behavior of the system in the regime ( @xmath164 ) may seem strange : the energy density does not increase with the temperature all this could follow as a consequence that the one  loop approximation may not be appropriate in some regimes for a magnetized system in presence of finite density and temperature .",
    "this issue deserves a separate study , possibly in the context of non - perturbative calculations at high magnetic fields , which explore a different approach that may be applicable to the magnetized gas that we have examined here ( see @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "we have examined the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of a magnetized , self  gravitating electron gas at finite temperature , taken as the source of a simplified bianchi i space  time represented by a kasner metric , which is the simplest geometry that allows us identify the magnetic field as the main source of anisotropy .",
    "we regard this configuration as a toy model that roughly approximates a grand canonical subsystem of a magnetized electron source in the conditions prevailing near of the center and rotation axis of a compact object ( in which spatial gradients of physical and kinematic variables may be regarded as negligible ) . the resulting einstein ",
    "maxwell field equations were transformed into a system of non  linear autonomous evolution equations , which were solved numerically in the collapsing regime for a chemical potential : @xmath165 , a magnetic field in the range @xmath166 and temperatures @xmath167 .    for all initial conditions that we considered the gas evolves into a collapsing singularity , which can be ( depending on the initial conditions ) isotropic ( `` point  like '' ) or anisotropic ( `` cigar  like '' ) .",
    "we found that for lower initial values of the magnetic field and temperatures ( @xmath168 ) the resulting singularity is always point  like singularity , independently of the initial values of the shear .",
    "this result may be connected with the stability of volume elements in less idealized configurations , an issue that is outside the scope of this paper and deserves a proper examination elsewhere .",
    "the collapse time decreases as the initial magnetic field increases , but we did not find a direct proportionality relation between this time and the initial temperature ( this may be a consequence of having assumed a high density regime ) .",
    "the behavior of the temperature as the collapse proceeds also depends on initial conditions : for initial temperatures @xmath169 the gas cools down and for values @xmath170 the temperature increases .    using the numerical solutions of the system we found",
    "a monotonic relation between the magnetization and the magnetic field and between the energy density and the temperature for high temperature values , but relation does not occur for low temperature values .",
    "this difference in behavior can be explained by the predominance of the magnetic effects at low temperatures , though it may also be due to the limitations introduced by assuming an equation of state and a thermodynamical potential based on a one  loop approximation .",
    "looking at this issue is beyond the scope of this paper and will be pursued in a separate work .",
    "the study we have presented can be readily applied to examine hadronic systems ( complying with suitable balance conditions and adequate chemical potentials ) .",
