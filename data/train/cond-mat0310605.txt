    "the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) was introduced by bak , tang , and wiesenfeld as a model of self - organized criticality  @xcite .",
    "this well - known model was designed to demonstrate how simple rules can drive a system to a critical point , and thus produce power laws , without any fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "it has thus been used to explain power laws in a wide range of systems  see  @xcite for a review .",
    "since the asm was first introduced , a number of variations on the model have been introduced ",
    "see  @xcite for a review",
    ". however , the original asm still provides a simple , important , and robust model for the generation of power laws .",
    "the asm is defined on a square lattice .",
    "each site @xmath0 of the lattice has a height variable , @xmath1 , which can be any integer from 1 to 4 , inclusive , where @xmath1 represents the number of grains of sand at that site . at each timestep",
    ", a grain of sand is added to a random site of the lattice .",
    "after the addition of the grain , any site with more than four grains of sand is unstable , and collapses , losing four grains of sand , while each of its four neighbors gains one grain of sand .",
    "unstable sites are repeatedly collapsed , until every site is stable  i.e .",
    "no site has more than four grains .",
    "then , the next timestep , another grain is added , and the entire process is repeated .",
    "the original asm is spatially homogenous ( except for the boundaries , which break translational invariance ) , and most modifications of the sandpile model have kept this feature .",
    "however , here we consider the effects of a crack , represented by a defect line , along which grains of sand can be lost ; in other words , along which the number of grains is not conserved . in previous studies ,",
    "dissipation was added to the bulk of the asm ( not breaking translational invariance ) , and was shown to take the asm off its critical point  @xcite .",
    "our defect line of dissipation breaks translational invariance , and we show that it causes the two - dimensional plane of the asm to renormalize into two half planes with open boundary conditions .",
    "this shows that cracks in the asm are highly relevant , and essentially cleave the sandpile into separate pieces .",
    "we demonstrate this by looking at the universal coefficient associated with the modification of unit height probabilities at large distances from the defect , and at the correlation function between unit height variables on opposite sides of the defect .",
    "the green function for an asm with a defect line is calculated in section  [ sec : green.defect ] , and results for the height probabilities and correlations are presented in section  [ sec : height.defect ] .    for most models of interest in condensed matter physics",
    ", the bulk properties can be studied with the boundary playing little to no role .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional ising model is often studied on a torus , so as to eliminate boundary effects .",
    "however , this is not possible for the asm . in the bulk of the asm , the number of grains of sand is conserved during each toppling .",
    "if this was true for all sites , then eventually we would reach a state where topplings continued without end .",
    "the asm thus needs sites with dissipation  that is , sites where the number of grains is not conserved .",
    "the most natural way to do this is with open boundary conditions ; sites at the open boundaries become unstable when they have more then four grains ( just as in the bulk ) , but have only three neighbors to send grains to , and send the fourth grain `` off the edge , '' removing it from the system .",
    "since this dissipation is necessary for a well - defined sandpile , the boundary plays a crucial role in the asm , even when we are focused at points in the bulk .",
    "correlation functions far from the boundary are independent of the boundary conditions , just as in other condensed matter statistical mechanical models ; but the presence of dissipation somewhere in the asm ( e.g. at the open boundary ) is necessary for the model to be well - defined .",
    "we consider the effects of varying amounts of dissipation along a boundary , and show that any amount of dissipation at the edge results in the open boundary universality class .",
    "the green function is calculated in section  [ sec : green.boundary ] , and results for the height probabilities and correlations are presented in section  [ sec : height.boundary ] .",
    "these results are intuitively reasonable , since dissipation should be relevant in regions of the asm where the particles have no other way to leave the asm .",
    "however , it was also possible that such modifications could have resulted in new , as yet undiscovered , boundary conditions or defect states .",
    "for example , bariev , and mccoy and perk , added a line defect of modified bond strengths to the ising model , and found that they were able to continuously vary the dimension of the spin operator along the defect by varying the defect bond strength  @xcite .",
    "this continual variation occurred despite the fact that the ising model only has three conformally invariant boundary conditions .",
    "the asm has been associated with a conformal field theory ( cft ) . while cft s are generally well understood , the asm is a logarithmic cft ( lcft ) ( specifically , the @xmath2 cft ) , many aspects of which are still not well understood  @xcite . in particular , our understanding of the boundary states of lcft s is still fragmentary , and recent results on boundaries of the @xmath2 cft have been partially contradictory  @xcite .",
    "connections between the lcft bounary states , and the asm boundary states were made in  @xcite , but the asm representation of the some of the @xmath2 lcft boundary states is still unknown .",
    "modifications to the asm such as those described in this paper , and searches for other boundary conditions , could help eludicate these relationships .",
    "our results provide some evidence that the open and closed boundary conditions are the only possibilities for the asm , although it is still possible that further calculations in this vein could uncover new boundary conditions .",
    "the identification of boundary states as closed , or open , or in some new , as yet undiscovered class , uses arguments from cft that the coefficients associated with the falloff of expectation values ( height probabilities ) at large distances from the defect should be universal .",
    "our results both use this expected universality , and confirm it , since we find , for example , that the coefficient is unaffected by varying a free parameter corresponding to the amount of dissipation at the boundary .",
    "this confirmation , while expected , is valuable , given the anomalous and unsettled nature of boundary lcft associated with the asm .",
    "this is a particularly important point in light of recent arguments that use this universality to argue that the four height variables in the asm must correspond to different fields in the corresponding cft  @xcite .",
    "dhar pointed out asm is highly analytically tractable because of its abelian nature  the same state results whether grains of sand are added first at site @xmath0 and then at site @xmath3 , or first at site @xmath3 and then at site @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this is the basis of a well - established formalism for analyzing the asm ",
    "see  @xcite for a review .",
    "we only give a quick coverage of the essential points here .",
    "it is useful to first generalize the above description of the asm , to allow for more complicated topplings .",
    "the dynamics of the model are described by a toppling matrix , @xmath4 , where @xmath0 and @xmath3 label sites of the lattice .",
    "the dimension of @xmath5 is equal to the number of sites in the lattice , so @xmath5 becomes infinite - dimensional as the size of the lattice goes to infinity .",
    "we say that site @xmath0 is unstable if its height @xmath1 is greater than @xmath6 .",
    "if site @xmath0 is unstable , then every height changes by @xmath7 ( including at the site @xmath8 ) .",
    "we have the standard asm , with open boundary conditions , if @xmath4 is 4 when @xmath9 , -1 when @xmath0 and @xmath3 are nearest neighbors , and 0 otherwise .",
    "dhar showed that the states of any sandpile , given certain general conditions on the form of @xmath5 , are divided into transient states , which occur with probability zero after long amounts of time , and recurrent states , which all occur with equal probability after long amounts of time .",
    "the number of possible recurrent configurations is given by det(@xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , majumdar and dhar also showed how to find the probability for a site to have height one , and the joint probability for two sites to both have height one ( as well as other , more complicated probabilities )  @xcite .",
    "the toppling matrix is modified by removing specific bonds , and changing the toppling condition at certain sites .",
    "for example , if we want to force site @xmath0 to have height 1 , we change the toppling matrix so that @xmath10 , and remove three of the bonds to neighboring sites ( setting @xmath11 for those bonds ) . with this modified toppling matrix , @xmath12 , site @xmath0 is now guaranteed to have height 1 , and det(@xmath12 ) gives the number of recurrent configurations with @xmath13 . while @xmath5 and @xmath12 are infinite - dimensional matrices ( for an inifnite lattice ) , @xmath14 is 0 outside of a 4x4 submatrix .",
    "so det(@xmath12)/det(@xmath5)=det(@xmath15 ) is an easily computable 4 by 4 matrix determinant , which gives the probability that , in a randomly chosen recurrent configuration , the site @xmath0 will have height 1 .",
    "the same process , with a different ( 8 by 8) matrix @xmath16 , can be used to find two - point correlations of height 1 variables .",
    "this process requires us to calculate the green function @xmath17 .",
    "the green function has long been known for the standard asm , where @xmath5 is simply the lattice laplacian  @xcite . however , in the following sections we will be dealing with different toppling conditions , and so will need to calculate the green function for these new @xmath5 s .",
    "we introduce a defect line ( or crack ) through the middle of the asm , allowing dissipation to take place along the defect , and not just along the open boundary conditions .",
    "we take the lattice to be size @xmath18 , with the x - dimension taking on the values @xmath19 , and the y - dimension taking on the values @xmath20 .",
    "we take open boundary conditions along all edges , and put the defect along the line @xmath21 . along this line",
    ", the height variable can take on the values @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . a site along",
    "the defect topples if its height is greater than @xmath24 .",
    "when it topples , it sends one grain to each of its four neighbors , and @xmath25 grains of sand are dissipated ( i.e. disappear from the sandpile ) .",
    "when @xmath25 is a positive integer , the theory has its most obvious physical interpretation , but the theory can be modified to give a sensible interpretation for any rational , positive , value of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "if in each toppling , @xmath26 grains are toppled , and @xmath27 grains sent to each neighbor , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integers , then the ratio of grains dissipated to grains moved , @xmath28 , can be any rational integer .",
    "the toppling matrix @xmath5 is the same as for the standard asm , except that @xmath29 for sites @xmath0 along the defect . when @xmath30 it becomes the standard asm .",
    "the toppling matrix can be written as    @xmath31    since @xmath5 is hermitian , if we find all of its normalized eigenvectors , we can easily invert it .",
    "suppose that the eigenvectors of @xmath5 are @xmath32 , with eigenvalues",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are two - dimensional vectors and the number of possible values of @xmath34 is equal to the dimension of @xmath5 , which is in turn equal to the number of sites in the lattice .",
    "then    @xmath36    the form of @xmath5 in equation  [ eq : factorizedform ] implies that the eigenvectors of @xmath5 factorize into eigenvectors of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we thus want the eigenvectors of @xmath38 .",
    "( the eigenvectors of @xmath37 are not only simpler , but immediately follow from the eigenvectors of @xmath38 , by setting @xmath30 . )",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 range from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , so @xmath38 has @xmath43 eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvectors fall in three classes .",
    "there are @xmath42 oscillatory eigenvectors that are antisymmetric about @xmath21 , and have momenta @xmath44 evenly spaced between 0 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "there are another @xmath42 oscillatory eigenvectors that are symmetric about @xmath21 , and have momenta p in the range @xmath49 , where the @xmath44 solve a transcendental equation ; in the limit @xmath50 these momenta @xmath44 also become equally spaced between 0 and @xmath45 .",
    "finally , there is one exponentially decaying eigenvector , symmetric about @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath5 is hermitian , we can immediately obtain its inverse from these eigenvectors .",
    "the sums over the two oscillatory sets of eigenvectors each produce integrals in the limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 , using the euler - maclaurin formula .",
    "the last , exponentially decaying , eigenvector produces a single , discrete contribution to the green function . writing the green function as a sum of the contributions from the three classes of eigenvectors gives    @xmath52    where we have defined    @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 is the well - known bulk green function  @xcite :    @xmath55    we have also defined    @xmath56    we want the behavior of @xmath57 for @xmath58 large .",
    "the expansion of the bulk green function @xmath59 for large @xmath39 is well - known  @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "we also need the behavior of @xmath62 for @xmath39 large .",
    "the integral over @xmath63 in equation  [ eq : definitiong2a ] can be done exactly , and making the substitution @xmath64 gives a contour integral around the unit circle .",
    "the integrand has two poles inside the unit circle , but these give contributions which either decay exponentially with @xmath39 , or are independent of @xmath39 , neither of which affects our height calculations ; so these contributions can be dropped .",
    "the algebraic @xmath39-dependence comes from the branch cut in the integrand , running from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , which gives    @xmath67    where @xmath68 indicates that we take the principal part of the integral .",
    "we can use this to find the behavior of @xmath69 for large @xmath39 , by separating out the contributions from @xmath70 near 1 , and expanding in a laurent series in @xmath39 .",
    "this then gives the expansion of @xmath71 :    @xmath72    dropping terms independent of @xmath39 .",
    "now that we have the green function for the defect line , we can use it to calculate the height correlations , using the methods outlined in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we find that the probability for a site a distance @xmath39 from the defect to have height 1 is    @xmath73    the constant term , @xmath74 , is the bulk probability for a site to have height one , first calculated in  @xcite .",
    "it was also found in  @xcite that the correlation function between two height one operators is    @xmath75    thus , the height one operator is a dimension 2 operator . based on the identification of the asm as a conformal field theory  @xcite , the coefficient of @xmath76 , in expectation values of dimension 2 operators a distance @xmath39 from a boundary , is expected to be a universal number characteristic of the boundary condition  @xcite . and",
    ", in fact , this coefficient of + 1/4 in equation  [ eq : height.decay ] is exactly the coefficient seen for the height one probability at large distances from an open boundary condition , as shown by brankov , ivashkevich , and priezzhev  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that , upon renormalization , the defect line becomes an open boundary .",
    "it is only sensible to talk about conventional boundary conditions at the defect line , if the two half - planes on either side of the defect have somehow been separated .",
    "evidence that the defect renormalizes to separate the half - planes can be seen by looking at correlation functions of points on opposite sides of the defect .",
    "if , upon renormalizing the defect , the two sides of the defect were still `` connected , '' we would expect that height variables on opposite sides would still fall off as @xmath77 , since the height one operator has dimension 2 .",
    "( calculations of correlation functions along boundaries by ivashkevich have shown that the height one operator also has dimension 2 along open boundaries  @xcite . )",
    "however , we find that    @xmath78    while the height variable is a dimension two operator , its correlations across the defect fall off as @xmath79 .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath77 term renormalizes to zero , and the @xmath79 term is non - universal , depending continuously on @xmath25 . we thus conclude that the defect renormalizes to generate two separate half - planes with open boundary conditions .",
    "this is physically reasonable . adding dissipation throughout the bulk of the asm is known to be relevant , driving the system off criticality  @xcite .",
    "more recently , adding dissipation in the bulk was identified with adding the integral of a dimension 0 variable ( the logarithmic partner of the identity ) throughout the bulk  @xcite .",
    "it would thus appear that the local addition of dissipation should be represented by a dimension zero operator , which would mean that adding dissipation along a defect line should be relevant , as we have found here .",
    "in short , cracks in the asm cleave the plane into disconnected regions with open boundary conditions",
    ". similar separation with relevant perturbations along a defect occurs in other models  see , for example  @xcite .",
    "however , these results were not inevitable ; as already noted , line defects added by bariev , and mccoy and perk , to the ising model , resulted in a continual range of defect lines , along which the dimension of the spin operator could be continuously varied , despite the fact that the ising model only has three possible boundary conditions .",
    "the identification of a line of dissipation with open boundary conditions brings up the question of whether any other universality classes of boundary conditions with dissipation are even possible .",
    "the open and closed boundary conditions are the most natural to impose on the asm , but other boundary conditions than these two conventional ones can be written down .",
    "we create new boundary conditions by varying the amount of dissipation along the boundary , and show that , regardless of the amount of dissipation , we stay in the open boundary universality class ( so long as the amount of dissipation is nonzero  that is , so long as the boundary is not closed ) .",
    "it is convenient to change the dimensions of the lattice from those of section  [ sec : green.defect ] .",
    "we take the lattice to be of size @xmath80 , with the x - dimension taking on the values @xmath19 , and the y - dimension taking on the values @xmath81 .",
    "we impose a modified boundary condition along @xmath21 , and open boundary conditions on the other three edges .",
    "( in the end , we take the limits @xmath50 and @xmath51 , so our results should anyway be insensitive to the boundary conditions on these three edges . )",
    "we allow the height variable on the boundary , @xmath21 , to take on values @xmath82 .",
    "sites on the boundary become unstable when their height is greater than b , at which point they topple , giving one grain to each of their three neighbors , and dropping @xmath83 grains off the edge . for @xmath84",
    "this is the closed boundary condition , and for @xmath85 this is the open boundary condition . for @xmath86 ,",
    "sand is generated with each toppling , rather than dissipated , creating the possibility of never - ending cycles of toppling .",
    "we therefore only consider @xmath87 .",
    "the system can be given a sensible interpretation for any rational value of @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the toppling matrix between sites @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be written    @xmath91    where @xmath37 was defined in equation  [ eq : bulk1dg ] , and    @xmath92    as with the defect , if we can find all the eigenvectors of @xmath5 , we can easily invert it .",
