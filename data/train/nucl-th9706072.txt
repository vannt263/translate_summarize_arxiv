    "the main motivation for studying @xmath0-photoproduction on the deuteron is to obtain information on the elementary process on the neutron .",
    "the evident advantages of using a deuteron target are ( i ) the small binding energy of nucleons in the deuteron , which from the kinematical point of view provides the case of a nearly free neutron target , and ( ii ) minimal number of nucleons , reducing the influence of a nuclear environment on the elementary production process and allowing a careful microscopic treatment .",
    "the interest in the elementary process on the neutron is closely connected with the question concerning the isotopic structure of the @xmath3(1535 ) photoexcitation amplitude . a combined analysis of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and inclusive @xmath6 reactions @xcite have confirmed its predominantly isovector character as predicted by quark models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , very recently exclusive measurements of the ( @xmath7 ) reaction on the deuteron for quasifree kinematics with detection of forward emerging nucleons in coincidence with etas were performed @xcite .",
    "this experiment , providing direct information on the ratio @xmath8 , is expected to be quite precise , since the experimental systematic errors as well as different model corrections will largely cancel . from the data of @xcite the ratio @xmath9 of the isoscalar to the proton amplitude",
    "is extracted as @xmath10 . at the same time , if one wants to find agreement between the data on the coherent @xmath11 cross section of @xcite and conventional impulse approximation calculations @xcite , one needs a considerably larger parameter @xmath12 .",
    "if one assumes that the value @xmath13 is more reliable , one is lead to the conclusion that the impulse approximation fails in describing the coherent reaction .",
    "thus one either would need to search for new mechanisms dominating the coherent process or one would need to question the accuracy of the experimental data .",
    "it should be noted , that the method of extracting the information about the single nucleon processes from the deuteron data is based on the so - called spectator - nucleon model , in which the pure quasifree production is considered as the only mechanism for the knock - out @xmath14 reaction .",
    "therefore , a careful investigation of the validity of this approximation , i.e. , the estimation of possible other effects is needed .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study the role of rescattering in the final state of the @xmath15 process .",
    "one can expect that such effects become important close to the reaction threshold . in this region the smallness of the excitation energy in the final @xmath16-system and the large momentum transfer ( which is about the @xmath0 mass in the @xmath17 c.m .",
    "frame ) lead to a kinematical situation , where two final nucleons move primarily together with a large total , but small relative momentum . for this kinematics ,",
    "the spectator model is expected to give a very small cross section since the momenta of both nucleons are large and , on the other hand , the corrections due to the strong @xmath18-interaction may be significant .",
    "furthermore , as has been shown in @xcite , the @xmath0-rescattering can also visibly change the @xmath15 cross section near threshold .",
    "in section [ section2 ] we present the isobar model for the elementary @xmath0-photoproduction process .",
    "the treatment of the @xmath15 amplitude , based on time - ordered perturbation theory including @xmath19 and @xmath18-rescattering , is developed in section [ section3 ] .",
    "a similar approach was adopted for the analysis of coherent @xmath20-photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite . in our notation , we follow mainly this paper . in this section , we also discuss the effects of rescattering on cross sections and polarization observables and compare our results with available experimental data .",
    "finally , some attention is paid to the interpretation of experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the coherent process .",
    "as a starting point we consider the elementary process @xmath21 which we need as input for studying the @xmath0-photoproduction on the deuteron",
    ". the four momenta of the participating particles are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 stands for the photon polarization vector .",
    "the particle energies are @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses of nucleon and @xmath0 meson , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denote the absolute values of the respective three - momenta .",
    "past studies @xcite of the @xmath31 process for photon lab energies from threshold up to 800 mev have clearly shown the dominant role of the @xmath3(1535 ) resonance which decays with a relatively large probability into the @xmath19 channel .",
    "for this reason we have chosen a nonrelativistic isobar model , in which the @xmath0-photoproduction proceeds exclusively through the electric dipole transition to the @xmath3(1535 ) ( hereafter denoted by @xmath32 ) .",
    "possible background contributions , such as nucleon pole and vector meson exchange , are neglected because of their insignificance in the energy region under consideration . within the mentioned model the elementary @xmath0-photoproduction amplitude in an arbitrary frame of reference reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 invariant mass .",
    "the nonrelativistic current for the electromagnetic vertex @xmath36 is given by @xmath37[16 ] where @xmath38 is the resonance mass and @xmath39 stands for the relative photon - nucleon momentum @xmath40 the vertex constant @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of the helicity amplitude @xmath42 of the @xmath32 photoexcitation @xmath43 furthermore , we introduce the isoscalar @xmath44 and isovector @xmath45 coupling constants in accordance with the isotopic structure of the photoproduction amplitude for an isoscalar meson @xmath46 for the hadronic vertex @xmath47 we use the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath48 finally , the @xmath32 propagator @xmath49 involves the energy dependent decay width @xmath50 the partial @xmath19 and @xmath51 widths are related to the corresponding coupling constants in our nonrelativistic approach @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the momentum of the respective particle in the @xmath35 c.m .  system . following ref .",
    "@xcite we treat the @xmath32 width for the @xmath54 channel purely phenomenologically , as a constant above @xmath54 threshold .",
    "thus the full @xmath0-photoproduction amplitude may be written in the form @xmath55 in the actual calculation we use the following set of @xmath32 parameters @xmath56 which gives for the total and partial decay widths at the resonance position @xmath57 @xmath58 this parametrization is reasonably consistent with the values following from the 1996 pdg listings @xcite .",
    "the amplitude ( [ 25 ] ) gives quite a good description of the @xmath4 total cross section data @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) if we take for the proton helicity amplitude the value @xmath59gev@xmath60 .",
    "now we turn to incoherent @xmath0-photoproduction on the deuteron @xmath61 the momenta of all particles are defined similarly to those in section [ section2 ] .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the small region of incident photon energies from threshold up to 720 mev .",
    "all calculations refer to the laboratory frame , @xmath62 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the coordinate system is chosen to have a right - hand orientation with @xmath63-axis along the photon momentum @xmath64 and @xmath65-axis parallel to @xmath66 .",
    "we work in the isospin formalism and consider the two outgoing nucleons symmetrically , not specifying their isotopic states .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 is taken to be 0.11 , which , as will be discussed below , produces the best agreement with experimental data .",
    "the laboratory cross section for the reaction ( [ 31 ] ) with unpolarized particles reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the reaction amplitude @xmath69 here @xmath70 stands for the deuteron spin projection , and the final two nucleon state is specified by the nucleon momenta @xmath71 , @xmath72 as well as by spin @xmath73 and isospin @xmath74 quantum numbers .",
    "the corresponding fully antisymmetric @xmath18-function can formally be written as @xmath75 the deuteron wave function in ( [ 33 ] ) is noncovariantly normalized to unity .",
    "the fourier transform of its internal part separating the spin part has the familiar form @xmath76 for the radial functions @xmath77 we use the parametrization of the bonn - potential model ( obepq - version ) @xcite .",
    "the main features of the process ( [ 31 ] ) will be investigated by considering the partially integrated cross sections @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which are obtained from the fully exclusive cross section @xmath80 is expressed in terms of relative @xmath81 and total @xmath82 momenta of the two final nucleons .",
    "we prefer this choice of variables , because in this case the kinematic factor does not have any singularity on the boundary of the available phase space , when @xmath830 @xcite . with respect to polarization observables ,",
    "we consider in this work only the tensor asymmetries @xmath84 of the deuteron target , which , as will be discussed , is most sensitive to the effects of rescattering .",
    "for this observable , we use the definition similar to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite for deuteron photodisintegration @xmath85 where @xmath86 thus , for example , the asymmetry @xmath87 is given by the expression @xmath88 then , the cross section can be expressed in terms of the unpolarized cross section and the tensor target asymmetry as @xmath89,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the degree of deuteron tensor polarization with respect to the orientation for which the deuteron density matrix is diagonal and which is characterized by the angles @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the chosen coordinate system .",
    "the transition matrix elements @xmath68 are calculated in the frame of time - ordered perturbation theory , using the electromagnetic and hadronic vertices , introduced in section [ section2 ] . as full amplitude we include besides the pure impulse approximation ( ia ) one - loop @xmath18- and @xmath19-rescattering terms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath93 another possible two - step @xmath0-production mechanism in the two - nucleon system @xmath94 gives a negligible contribution as was shown in @xcite .",

    "the amplitude ( [ 45 ] ) corresponds to the simple spectator - nucleon model .",
    "the elementary operator @xmath111 produces the ( @xmath112 ) process on the nucleon , which takes the whole photon energy available after meson production . since in our approach",
    "the spectator nucleon is taken to be on - shell , the active nucleon is off - shell as determined by the energy and momentum conservation at the corresponding vertex @xmath113 in order to qualitatively explain the approximations concerning the rescattering terms , discussed below , we would like to demonstrate here some features of the reaction amplitude keeping in ( [ 37 ] ) only the impulse approximation . due to",
    "the large transferred momentum associated with the large @xmath0 mass , the @xmath0-angular distribution shows a fast decrease with increasing angle , so that the major part of the cross section is concentrated in the forward direction .",
    "therefore , we choose for the discussion the forward angle region .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath79 calculated within the spectator model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the lab photon energy , where in addition the separate contribution from the various important partial waves in the initial and final states are shown .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn :    \\(i ) because of the large velocity of both outgoing nucleons near threshold , the high momentum components of the deuteron wave function become significant . as a consequence , a few mev above threshold a rather large contribution from the deuteron @xmath114-wave arises leading to a strong distructive interference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 states which reduces sizeably the pure @xmath117-wave cross section . with increasing photon energy , the role of the @xmath114-wave decreases rapidly , e.g. , at @xmath118 mev",
    "this reduction amounts to only 8@xmath119 .",
    "\\(ii ) the separate contributions from the @xmath120 and @xmath116 states of the final @xmath18-system clearly show the dominance of the singlet over the triplet @xmath121-wave .",
    "the strong suppression of the @xmath116 state is due to the small isoscalar part of the @xmath0-photoproduction amplitude ( in our calculation @xmath122 0.12@xmath123 ) so that the transition from the deuteron bound state ( @xmath107,@xmath124 ) to the continuum @xmath18-state ( @xmath108,@xmath125 ) is most probable .",
    "if one neglects the @xmath114-wave of the deuteron , the following approximate relation holds @xmath126 this strong dominance of the singlet @xmath121-wave state is slightly reduced by the presence of the @xmath114-component , in particular near threshold .      the diagram ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] describes the @xmath18-rescattering whose amplitude is given by @xmath127 the free nonrelativistic propagator of the two nucleons in terms of the relative @xmath18-momenta @xmath81 and @xmath128 has the form @xmath129 the @xmath18 dynamics in the final state is determined by the half - off - shell nucleon - nucleon + @xmath130-matrix @xmath131 , which we evaluate for the same obepq bonn potential @xcite as for the deuteron wave function .",
    "we restrict the @xmath18-rescattering to the @xmath120 state .",
    "this approximation is justified by the previous observation that due to the spin - isospin selection rules the contribution from the triplet @xmath116 state is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that from the @xmath120 state . as for",
    "the higher partial waves , their distortion is expected to be of minor importance compared to the resonant @xmath120-wave , since in the kinematical region considered in this work the relative kinetic energy in the @xmath18-system is less than 72 mev ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "within this approximation , a straightforward calculation yields finally @xmath132 .",
    "since , as was noticed above , the deuteron @xmath114-wave component plays a non - negligible role in the ia , it was also taken into account in the matrix element ( [ 55 ] ) .",
    "the influence of @xmath18-rescattering is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the @xmath0-momentum distribution at a given angle @xmath133 .",
    "as expected , the strong interaction between the final nucleons in the @xmath120 state changes drastically the cross section for large @xmath0 momentum values .",
    "when @xmath28 reaches its maximum , the excitation energy @xmath134 in the @xmath16-pair vanishes , and thus the resonant @xmath120 state appears as a rather narrow peak .",
    "the same effect is noted for charged @xmath135-photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite as well as for deuteron electrodisintegration @xcite . in principle , the experimental observation of this peak in the high @xmath0-momentum spectrum may serve as another evidence for the isovector nature of the @xmath32 photoexcitation . in the hypothetical case @xmath136 , the low - energy @xmath18-rescattering would be dominated by the @xmath116 state , which does not exhibit any resonant behaviour at @xmath137 0 .    in conclusion",
    ", one sees that the role of @xmath18-rescattering is quite important , especially for small photon energies . at higher energies ,",
    "the main part of the cross section is dominated by the ia , which gives a rather broad quasifree bump , where the role of @xmath18-rescattering is expected to be of minor importance .",
    "the contribution from the deuteron @xmath114-wave is only significant close to threshold .",
    "its effect is a destructive interference between the @xmath138 and the dominant @xmath139 transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we depict also the tensor target asymmetries for @xmath140 at two different photon energies .",
    "one readily notes that the asymmetry @xmath87 is strongly affected by @xmath18-rescattering .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath87 is directly defined by the difference between the cross section on the deuteron with spin parallel and perpendicular to the photon beam direction ( see ( [ t20 ] ) ) .",
    "because of the spin - transverse form of the elementary operator ( [ 25 ] ) , the transition @xmath139 may occur in the @xmath0-photoproduction process with only opposite directions of photon and deuteron spin .",
    "consequently , the strong @xmath120 interaction between the final nucleons , enhancing the probability of this transition , increases the contribution from the matrix elements @xmath68 in ( [ t20 ] ) with @xmath1411 .",
    "the other target asymmetries , @xmath142 and @xmath143 which are not shown here , appear not to be sensitive to the @xmath18-rescattering contribution . for the photon asymmetry @xmath144 we have a trivial relation @xmath145 , which follows from our neglect of other terms besides the @xmath32-excitation amplitude in the elementary operator .",
    "the @xmath19-rescattering amplitude given by the the diagram ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] reads @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "similarly to the @xmath18-case ( [ 53 ] ) , we use the nonrelativistic propagator for the relative @xmath19-motion @xmath148 in the spirit of our isobar approach , we consider the @xmath19-interaction to proceed only via the @xmath32 formation , which gives the @xmath130-matrix in the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the @xmath19 invariant mass and other parameters are defined in section [ section2 ] .",
    "collecting the various pieces , we obtain for the amplitude ( [ 61 ] ) @xmath151 \\frac{d^3q_{\\eta n}^{\\,\\prime}}{(2\\pi)^3 }    @xmath152 and @xmath153 @xmath154 .",
    "the effect of @xmath19-rescattering is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the @xmath0-angular distribution in the @xmath17 c.m .",
    "frame , where we also compare our results with experimental data for the inclusive reaction @xmath6 @xcite . in view of the small isoscalar part @xmath155 of the elementary amplitude and the large momentum mismatch",
    ", the contribution from the coherent @xmath11 process is expected to be negligible and , thus , the inclusive @xmath0-spectrum is dominated by the deuteron break - up channel . in the backward direction ,",
    "the increase from @xmath19-rescattering is in part kinematically enhanced . at these angles ,",
    "the nucleons leave the interaction region with large momenta .",
    "therefore , the spectator model gives a very small cross section understimating the data by roughly a factor of 3 for @xmath156 mev .",
    "in this situation , the @xmath19-rescattering mechanism , allowing the large transferred momentum to be shared between two participating nucleons , becomes much more effective .",
    "the resonant character of the @xmath19-interaction appears more pronounced at forward angles .",
    "although its strong inelasticity decreases the cross section at high photon energies , close to threshold this effect is more than compensated by the attraction in the @xmath19-system .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the total @xmath15 cross section .",
    "one readily notes , that the simple spectator approach can not describe the experimental data close to the threshold ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as has been discussed in the introduction , at small photon energies the spectator model considers the @xmath15 process to proceed mainly through the high deuteron fourier component , which appears only with small probability .",
    "the final state interaction provides a mechanism for bypassing this suppression .",
    "our model predicts quite a significant contribution from @xmath18-rescattering .",
    "it turns out to be dominant in the vicinity of the threshold and still increases the spectator results by about 10@xmath119 at @xmath156 mev .",
    "the @xmath19-interaction is relatively less important , but is also significant mainly through the constructive interference between @xmath18- and @xmath19-rescattering contributions . with inclusion of the rescattering effects",
    ", we are able to reproduce the experimental cross section with @xmath157 .    at this point",
    ", we would like to discuss briefly the possibility of extracting the ratio @xmath158 from the corresponding ratio of exclusive @xmath159 and @xmath160 yields as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "the simple relation @xmath161 consistent with a pure spectator approach is not valid away from quasifree kinematics , in particular , when final state interaction is taken into account .",
    "this is due to the fact , that rescattering `` mixes '' the single proton and neutron @xmath0-photoproduction processes , as is illustrated schematically in fig .  [ fig8 ] , taking as an example the @xmath18-interaction term .",
    "thus , in the region where the rescattering effects are dominant , the right hand side of ( [ 71 ] ) approximates unity in contrast to the elementary ratio .    in general",
    ", we can conclude from the above investigations , that the relation ( [ 71 ] ) works well for photon energies not too close to the threshold . as a confirmation , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the theoretical ratio @xmath162 of the differential cross sections for the reaction @xmath14 without and with rescattering versus the photon lab energy @xmath163 and compare it to the corresponding value for free nucleons .",
    "the difference between the ratio for free nucleons and that for the deuteron , obtained within the spectator model , is due to the fact , that to the integration over nucleon momenta not only fast moving active nucleons but also slow ones partly contribute .",
    "one can see , that the additional final state interaction encreases even more the ratio when approaching the threshold .",
    "however , for the energies considered in @xcite , its role is negligible , and from this point of view the validity of ( [ 71 ] ) is fully justified .",
    "the ratio of the neutron to the proton cross sections @xmath164 , corresponding to @xmath157 , which we have used in this work and which reproduces well the @xmath6 data of @xcite , slightly understimates the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath165 .",
    "finally , we would like to make a short comment on the coherent photoproduction process on the deuteron .",
    "we first note , that the sensitivity of the break - up cross section to a variation of @xmath166 is much less pronounced than for the coherent reaction , which is proportional to @xmath167 .",
    "the present study within the isobar model has shown , that the experimental uncertainity in the @xmath15 total cross section for photon energies between threshold and 720 mev @xcite fixes the parameter @xmath166 within the limits of @xmath168 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we demonstrate the strong sensitivity on @xmath166 of the @xmath0-angular distribution of the coherent reaction , which we have calculated within the conventional impulse approximation .",
    "in addition to the @xmath3(1535 ) resonance , the contributions from @xmath169(1520 ) as well as the nucleon pole term and @xmath163-meson exchange in the t - channel were included in the elementary operator ( for further detailes see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not touch here upon the question about the role of meson rescattering in the coherent reaction , which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "however , one can expect , that due to its two - particle character , this effect will not strongly affect the coherent process in the region of forward @xmath0-angles which is associated with relatively small momentum transfer . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] even the largest permissible value @xmath170 gives a cross section , which is by more than a factor three below the data . only with a rather large isoscalar amplitude corresponding to @xmath171 the impulse approximation",
    "could describe the data well .",
    "this seeming inconsistency between the coherent and incoherent reaction with respect to the precise value of the parameter @xmath166 certainly needs further experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "we have studied incoherent @xmath0-photoproduction on the deuteron in the near threshold region .",
    "the elementary photoproduction amplitude , based on a pure isobar model , for which the @xmath172 and @xmath173 vertices have been fitted , gives a good description of the experimental @xmath31 cross section data . as for the deuteron amplitude ,",
    "we have considered in addition to the spectator - nucleon approach also @xmath18-rescattering in the most important @xmath120 channel and @xmath19-rescattering .",
    "while the pure spectator model produces only a small fraction of the observed cross section near threshold , the strong attractive @xmath18-interaction in the resonant @xmath120 state enhances it considerably .",
    "the role of @xmath19-rescattering is found to be less important .",
    "with inclusion of both rescattering effects we obtain quite a satisfactory agreement with the available data on the @xmath6 differential and total cross sections , using as input for the ratio of isoscalar to proton amplitude @xmath157 .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with @xmath174 , extracted from the recently measured ratio @xmath175 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown , that this extraction can be justified within the frame of the pure spectator - nucleon model , since the role of final state interaction under the corresponding kinematical conditions is negligible .",
