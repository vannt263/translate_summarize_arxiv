    "the true uv escape fraction is little different ; because the true total sfr is higher , the true h@xmath0 escape fraction is lower .",
    "another scenario is that massive stars stopped forming within the last 15 myr . perhaps some of the high - redshift dusty galaxies have complicated star formation histories ; the combined effect of deriving correct sfrs might lead to lower dispersion .",
