    "a multipartite quantum system , in addition to local quantum coherence that exists within each of subsystems , may have nonlocal or distributed quantum coherence that exists among several distinct subsystems .",
    "this property is entangle , which is superposition of the internal states of the systems and can not be separated into product states of the individual subsystem .",
    "it is recognized as entirely quantum - mechanical effect and have played a crucial role in practical application ranging from quantum information@xcite , cryptography@xcite and quantum computation@xcite , to atomic and molecular spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "recent , many groups were able to prepare entangled states in a variety of physical systems and experimental setups , demonstrating an impressive ability to manipulate and detect them efficiently.b1,aa1,aa2,aa3,aa4,aa5,aa6,aa7 in particular , almeida _",
    "et al_.b1 showed that , using an all - optical experimental setup , even when the environment - induced decay of each system is asymptotic , quantum entanglement may appear `` entanglement sudden death '' , called esd@xcite , that is , entanglement terminates completely after a finite interval , without a smoothly diminishing long - time tail .",
    "as we known , a major obstacle for the controlled entanglement of more and more subsystems remains with the capacity of achieving perfect screening of the system from the environment . after some time",
    ", the unavoidable residual interaction with the environment induces mixing of the system state , and thus the emergence of classical correlations at the expense of quantum entanglement .",
    "hence , we face the high relevant task of understanding the sources of entanglement decay , what implies the identification of the associated time scales . in addition",
    "to be enlightened by the experimental discovery of esd , a large number of theoretical literature have investigated the disentanglement dynamics.@xcite z. ficek and r. tana @xcite propose the review with an overview of the mathematical apparatus necessary for describing the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field .",

    "et al.__c2 start with a short recollection of environment models adapted for decoherence process in a typical quantum optical context under the assumption of complete positivity and markovian dynamics in the lindblad form .",
    "yu and eberly @xcite showed that the dynamics of the quantum entanglement between two qubits interacting independently with either quantum noise or classical noise displays a completely different behavior from the dynamics of the local coherence . instead of the exponential decay in time of the local coherence , quantum entanglement may disappear within a finite time in the dynamical evolution .",
    "the `` entanglement sudden death '' has been experimentally demonstrated by almeida .",
    "however , it is surprising that few if any fundamental treatment exist of decoherence that include the dynamics of disentanglement on better than an markovian approximation or phenomenological .",
    "although , the use of the markovian approximation is justified in a large variety of quantum optical experiments where entanglement has been produced , one should notice that non - markovian effects are important in the description of some condensed - matter system@xcite , such as the quantum dot qubit(s ) system .",
    "therefore , a non - markovian effects of the decoherence in any viable realization of qubits is desirable .    in this paper",
    "we examined the disentanglement dynamics of two entangled qubits due to spontaneous emission , where the interaction with the environment without rotating - wave approximation and the treatment process without markovian approximation .",
    "it is found that disentanglement always take only a finite - time to be completed , called `` entanglement sudden death '' , when the coupling between qubit and environment is strong . while the coupling with dissipation environments is weak to fine structure constant @xmath0 , the disentanglement change from exponential decay to entanglement sudden - death with the increasing of the portion of the double excitation component in the initial entangled state .",
    "we describe the sudden - death time of entanglement or the realized lifetime of the given two - qubit entanglement system through the measurable parameters : coupling constant with the enviornment @xmath1 energy splitting @xmath2 and cut - off frequency @xmath3 .",
