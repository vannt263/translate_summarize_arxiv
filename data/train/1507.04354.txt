    "@xcite is an interesting axion model as it is free from the above - mentioned domain wall problem .",
    "this is achieved by allowing only one right - handed quark to carry a pq charge and thus rendering a unique vacuum @xmath11@xcite .",
    "for consistency , the model requires two higgs doublet fields , one of which is also charged under the pq symmetry . as a result , there is a non - trivial flavor structure in the yukawa couplings@xcite that can lead to flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) couplings of the higgs bosons to at least quarks .",
    "besides , such fcnc couplings depend on the helicity of fermions , that is not shared in common two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm s )",

    "it should be emphasized that @xmath78 in eq .",

    "one striking feature of @xmath78 is that flavor violation is associated with large asymmetries in chirality .",

    "in such a simplified scenario , the mixing matrix @xmath80 can be parameterized as : @xmath91 where the mixing angle @xmath92 is defined by @xmath93 in this paper we do not consider any cp - violating effects and set @xmath94 to zero for simplicity .",
    "therefore , the flavor mixing phenomena are described solely by the parameter @xmath92 .",

    "so far , we have assumed that the lepton sector is not charged under the pq symmetry , as for the down - type quark sector .",
    "as alluded to earlier , we have the freedom to assign nonzero pq charges to leptons without causing any problem . as an example",

    "then we expect a flavor structure similar to the up - type quark sector , and @xmath78 now should also include the leptonic part : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the counterpart of @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , this lagrangian describes lepton flavor violation with the chirality asymmetry as in the up - type quark sector .",
    "one can use the same parametrization as in eq.([eq : mixing_parametrization ] ) , with the mixing matrix @xmath103 in the lepton sector rotating the right - handed @xmath104 and @xmath105 . note that the rotation angle @xmath106 can be different from @xmath92 in general .",
    "we consider only the cp - conserving case ( _ i.e. _ , the corresponding leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath107 ) in this paper as well .",

    "the cms collaboration recently reported a measurement of the flavor - violating decay @xmath4",
    "@xcite . the observed branching ratio for this decay mode @xmath243 where @xmath244 denotes the number of observed events , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 are the integrated luminosity , the acceptance of the selection cuts , and the total production cross section in the sm , respectively . to relate this quantity to our model",
    ", we have to including a correction factor in the production cross section : @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the @xmath141 coupling scale factor in our model relative to the sm one and we have assumed that the production is dominated by the ggf mechanism .",
    "the vbf mechanism also partly contributes to the cross section .",
    "we have checked that including the vbf production would infer a smaller value of @xmath79 to explain the signal .",
    "our result above is thus considered as a more conservative estimate .",
    "the branching ratio in the model is found to be @xmath250 where we have included only the @xmath251 and @xmath252 decays in the denominator .",
    "therefore , we obtain for @xmath253 s @xmath254 that @xmath255 in order to explain the observed @xmath4 events . we show the corresponding parameter regions using the green bands in fig.[fig : arho ] .",
    "the green ( light green ) band width corresponds to the @xmath236 ( @xmath151 ) error quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cms_fcnc ] ) . as seen in the plot , even with maximal mixing @xmath256 we required @xmath257 .",
    "this model predicts the same helicity structure as in the top sector discussed in the previous section , that is , decaying higgs provides left - handed @xmath258 in @xmath259 decay .",
    "we can confirm it by observing the energy fraction carried by the visible decay products of the @xmath104 .",
    "for the left - handed @xmath104 decay the visible energy fraction distribution is expected softer  @xcite .",
    "the fact that full event kinematics reconstruction is possible in this process makes the analysis straightforward .    finally , we comment on the related lepton flavor - violating decay : @xmath260 .",
    "it is found that , as also discussed in ref.@xcite , the decay rate of @xmath260 is well below the present experimental upper bound in the parameter region for explaining the @xmath4 events .",
    "in this work , we have studied the top - specific variant axion model and the phenomenology related to the flavor - changing yukawa couplings of the top quark .",
    "this model is well - motivated to solve the strong cp domain wall problem .",
    "only the right - handed top quark field is charged under the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry .",
    "two higgs doublet fields are required for consistency and one of them also carries a nonzero pq charge .",
    "compared with the usual two - higgs doublet models , this model has additional flavor mixing parameters .",
    "we investigated in detail the scenario with top - charm mixing , governed by a mixing parameter @xmath92 , leading to modifications of yukawa couplings and predicting the @xmath261 decay .",
    "we constrained the model parameter space using the current higgs data on signal strengths of different channels and bounds on the branching ratio of @xmath261 decay .",
    "while the decoupling limit is favored by the data , a small parameter space with the wrong sign in bottom yukawa coupling still can not be ruled out at the moment .",
    "moreover , we found that a large portion of the allowed parameter space will be covered by the @xmath261 search at lhc run - ii .",
    "the helicity structure in the flavor - changing top yukawa coupling is a specific feature of the model .",
    "the coupling between the left - handed top and the right - handed charm is stronger than that in the other chirality combination .",
    "we illustrated that this property could be measured in the decay distribution of spin - correlated top pair production once a sufficient number of signal events are collected .",
    "we also note that the sensitivity assumed here is conservative and further improvement in the sensitivity of the @xmath261 decay measurement at the lhc would be possible and very important .",
    "we have also considered the scenario where the right - handed @xmath104 lepton also carries a nonzero pq charge , as the right - handed top quark , and couples to the pq - charged higgs boson . in this case",
    ", we also expect to have the @xmath262 decay .",
    "interestingly , the parameter region allowed by the higgs signal strength data was slightly enlarged .",
    "we showed that the parameter regions required by the anomalous @xmath13 branching ratio reported by the cms collaboration had parts consistent with the above - mentioned constraints .",
    "the overlapped regions were marginal to the bounds on @xmath263 and well within the reach of the future lhc sensitivity .",
    "if so , we would expect the @xmath261 signal to be soon observed at the lhc run - ii . by measuring the tau polarization in the flavor - changing higgs decay , we could also probe the specific helicity structure in the lepton yukawa couplings of the model .",
    "the authors would like to thank m.  e.  peskin for some discussions about the @xmath264 decay that stimulates this analysis .",
