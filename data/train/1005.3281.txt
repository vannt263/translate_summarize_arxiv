    "at a distance of only 6.7  pc , the primary of the @xmath0  boo binary system , @xmath0  boo  a ( g8  v ) , is one of the two brightest `` moderately active '' coronal x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "the only star of this coronal activity level with a comparable x - ray flux at earth is @xmath3  eri ( k2  v , @xmath4  pc ) . as such ,",
    "these two stars are of crucial importance for establishing the coronal properties of stars that are significantly more active than the sun , but which are not in the extremely active regime that would be represented by the rs  cvn binaries or very young stars with rotation periods of only a few days .",
    "@xcite find that the coronal emission measure ( em ) distributions of @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo are similar to those of bright active regions on the sun .",
    "they note that the x - ray emission from these stars can therefore be explained by stellar surfaces that are completely covered with solar - like active regions , suggesting that @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo  a represent a maximum of solar - like activity for coronal stars , whereas stars with even higher x - ray luminosities and higher coronal temperatures represent a completely different regime of coronal activity .",
    "this interpretation places @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo  a at an interesting coronal transition point .",
    "further evidence that @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo  a lie near a transition in the nature of coronal activity comes from stellar wind measurements , which are based on analyses of h  i ly@xmath5 absorption from wind - ism interaction regions @xcite . at low activity levels mass loss increases with activity , with @xmath3  eri having a mass loss rate 30 times that of the sun ( i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the somewhat more active @xmath0  boo system has a surprisingly weak wind with only @xmath10 , leading to the suggestion that the observed increase of mass loss with activity ends abruptly at an x - ray surface flux of about @xmath11 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath9 , with @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo on opposite sides of this dividing line @xcite .",
    "the wind measurements suggest a slight modification of the proposal that @xmath3  eri and @xmath0  boo  a represent an extreme of truly solar - like activity .",
    "they suggest that @xmath3  eri is the true extreme , while @xmath0  boo  a actually lies beyond it at the low end of the non - solar - like activity regime .",
    "evidence that @xmath0  boo  a s magnetic topology is fundamentally different from the sun comes from spectropolarimetric measurements of photospheric fields on @xmath0  boo  a. @xcite find evidence for both a global dipole field component much stronger than that of the sun ( @xmath13  g ) , and a strong toroidal field component ( @xmath14  g ) that has no clear solar analog .",
    "we also note that the activity level of @xmath0  boo  a is roughly where one starts to see polar starspots @xcite , which also have no solar analog .",
    "@xcite find evidence for high latitude spots on @xmath0  boo  a , though not necessarily `` polar spots . ''",
    "perhaps the strong large - scale fields found by @xcite envelope the star and inhibit wind flow , explaining why @xmath0  boo s wind is surprisingly weak .",
    "consistent with this idea , @xcite present evidence that as stellar rotation and magnetic activity increase , stars tend to store a larger fraction of their magnetic energy in large scale fields , which could in principle inhibit mass loss",
    ".    with this background in mind , we here present an analysis of the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0  boo  a based on new observations from _ chandra _ , with the goal of seeing whether the apparent changes in coronal character noted above find clear expression in the coronal spectrum of @xmath0  boo  a , and coronal properties inferred from it .",
    "a similar spectrum of @xmath3  eri has already been analyzed , so a central goal of this paper is to compare the @xmath0  boo  a spectrum with that of @xmath3  eri and similar stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wl06 ) .",
    "other coronal spectra of @xmath0  boo have been obtained by previous x - ray and euv missions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the new _ chandra _ data are superior in many ways .",
    "one of them is that _",
    "chandra_/letgs observations allow the x - ray spectrum to be observed at high spectral resolution over a very broad spectral range of @xmath15   .",
    "this allows the detection of many coronal emission lines that have never been previously detected before from @xmath0  boo  a.",
    "another particulary important improvement is that _ chandra _ s superb spatial resolution allows us for the first time to truly address the issue of @xmath0  boo s binarity . for @xmath0  boo  a has a companion , @xmath0  boo",
    "b ( k4  v ) , which is only 6@xmath16 away , and _ no x - ray or uv observation of @xmath0  boo has ever truly resolved the binary .",
    "_ table  1 lists various properties of the two @xmath0  boo stars .",
    "the faster rotation and larger size of the primary lead to the expectation that @xmath0  boo  a should dominate the coronal emission from the system .",
    "detailed analyses of iue data and a rosat / hri image of @xmath0  boo do indeed suggest that @xmath0  boo  a dominates the binary s uv and x - ray emission @xcite , so the usual assumption of simply assigning all flux to the primary should be a decent approximation .",
    "however , @xmath0  boo  b s spectral type and rotation period are not that different from the x - ray luminous @xmath3  eri ( k2  v ; @xmath17  days ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0  boo  b should be contributing a non - negligible flux to the system s total x - ray emission .",
    "the older observations simply do not have sufficient spatial resolution to quantify how much .",
    "in short , the new _ chandra _ data presented here allow the first x - ray detection of @xmath0  boo  b , and they ensure that the brighter spectrum of @xmath0  boo  a is uncontaminated by any emission from the companion .",
    "the @xmath0  boo binary was observed on 2007  may  2 for 97.2  ksec with _ chandra _ s letgs configuration , combining the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and the component of the high resolution camera detector intended for use in spectroscopy ( hrc - s ) .",
    "the zeroth - order letgs image of @xmath0  boo is displayed in figure  1 , showing how cleanly the stars are separated in the _ chandra _ data , representing the first resolution of the binary in x - rays .",
    "we measure a position angle and stellar separation for the binary of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the @xmath20 and @xmath21 values expected from the system s orbital elements @xcite .",
    "the zeroth order image provides the simplest way to measure the contribution of each star to @xmath0  boo s total x - ray emission .",
    "the primary dominates the emission from the system , accounting for 88.5% of the total counts .",
    "we also use the zeroth order image to assess the variability of the two stars during the course of the daylong observation .",
    "figure  2 shows light curves for the two @xmath0  boo components , indicating significant variability for both stars . for @xmath0  boo  a , there appears to be a long duration flare near the beginning of the observation , and a much shorter duration event later on . in extracting spectra from the raw _ chandra _ data",
    ", we initially tried to separate flaring and quiescent times .",
    "however , we were unable to discern any clear differences between the resulting noisy flare spectrum and that of quiescence .",
    "thus , in the final spectral extraction procedure described below , we simply extract a single spectrum for each star , including both quiescent and flaring times .",
    "the standard pipeline processing of letgs data does not properly separate the spectra of the two stars , so the spectral extraction must be performed in a more manual fashion . in a previous paper we have described in detail how we extracted separate letgs spectra of stars in two other binary systems , 36  oph and 70  oph ( wl06 ) .",
    "we follow a very similar procedure here , which is now described in abbreviated form .    the data are processed using version 4.1.2 of the ciao software .",
    "the processing includes a removal of background counts using the standard `` light '' pulse height background filter available in ciao , but we also account for time - dependent gain corrections using software outside of ciao , corrections which would later be added to a subsequent official ciao release ( version 4.2 ) . by reducing background counts from our data , this filtering significantly improves the signal - to - noise of our final spectra .",
    "the processing initially yields a zeroth order image of the target at the aimpoint , which we have already discussed ( see fig .  1 ) , and two essentially identical spectra dispersed in opposite directions along the long axis of the hrc - s detector , a plus order and a minus order spectrum .",
    "the spatial resolution in the cross - dispersion direction worsens at long wavelengths where the spectrum is furthest from the focal point .",
    "we use a conservatively broad source extraction window with a width of 25 pixels centered on each stellar spectrum for @xmath22   .",
    "the window is broadened for @xmath23   . to avoid overlapping source windows ,",
    "for each star we expand the window only in the direction away from its companion star by 30 pixels . at the longest wavelengths , we have to accept that there is some small degree of unresolvable blending .",
    "we use 90 pixel background windows on each side of the stellar spectra to determine a wavelength dependent background to subtract from the spectra of the two stars .",
    "finally , the plus and minus order spectra are coadded to yield the final product shown in figure  3 .",
    "the clear separation of the @xmath0  boo binary allows the first precise and unambiguous measurement of the x - ray luminosity of both stars .",
    "the system s x - ray luminosity reported in the rosat all - sky survey is @xmath24 @xcite . dividing this emission between @xmath0  boo s two stars according to the contribution ratio suggested by figure  1 yields the rosat x - ray luminosities reported in table  1 .",
    "this new knowledge of the coronal activity of both @xmath0  boo stars has interesting ramifications for the interpretation of @xmath0  boo s wind measurement .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , @xmath0  boo has a measured wind strength of @xmath10 , but the measurement is for the combined wind of the system , and there is no way to tell from the observations the contribution of each star to this total @xcite .",
    "figure  4 plots mass loss rate as a function of coronal x - ray emission for all main sequence stars with measured winds , analogous to a figure from @xcite .",
    "but in this figure we plot separate points for @xmath0  boo  a and @xmath0  boo  b , for three different assumptions about how the collective wind is divided between the two stars .",
    "we now know for a fact that @xmath0  boo  b is very similar to @xmath3  eri , 36  oph , and 70  oph in terms of its coronal activity .",
    "but these stars all have rather high mass loss rates . the only way that @xmath0  boo  b can be consistent with even the weakest of these winds , that of 36  oph , is if @xmath0  boo  b accounts for practically all of @xmath0  boo s wind .",
    "this would leave the more active @xmath0  boo  a with a wind that is possibly weaker than that of the sun , despite its active corona , strengthening the case for the existence of a wind dividing line near an x - ray surface flux of @xmath11 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , where stronger large scale magnetic fields begin to inhibit mass loss . even if @xmath0  boo  a accounts for nearly all of the binary s wind , it would still be weak compared to that of @xmath3  eri , and then one would have to explain why @xmath0  boo  b apparently has a wind over an order of magnitude weaker than that of many other stars of equal activity .",
    "we come to the surprising conclusion that the most likely interpretation of the available data is that @xmath0  boo  b dominates the wind of the @xmath0  boo system .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the idea that a wind dividing line exists at an x - ray surface flux of about @xmath11 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath9 ( see  1 ) , separating less active stars with strong winds and more active stars with weaker winds @xcite .",
    "this activity dependent wind dividing line is not to be confused with the spectral type dependent wind - corona dividing line long known to exist for red giant stars @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that our conclusions rely on a very limited number of wind detections .",
    "further support for these interpretations should be sought from more wind measurements of main sequence stars , particularly for active stars .",
    "we use version 6.0 of the chianti atomic database to identify emission lines in our spectra @xcite .",
    "the identified lines are shown in figure  3 and listed in table  2 .",
    "table  2 lists counts for the detected lines , measured by direct integration from the spectra .",
    "line formation temperatures are quoted in the third column of the table , based on maxima of contribution functions computed using the ionization equilibrium computations of @xcite .",
    "uncertainties quoted in table  2 are 1@xmath25 . for the fainter @xmath0",
    "boo  b source , only the strongest lines are detected , but we quote 2@xmath25 upper limits for the nondetections , based on summing in quadrature the uncertainties in 5 bins surrounding the location of the line , and then multiplying this sum by two .",
    "measurements are made for all lines that appear visually to be at least marginally detected .",
    "however , cases in which the uncertainty implies a @xmath26 detection must be considered questionable .",
    "after the emission measure analysis described in  4.4 is completed , we confirm _ a posteriori _ that these questionable detections are at least plausible based on the derived emission measure distributions and abundances , which are constrained primarily by the stronger emission lines in the analysis .",
    "many of the emission lines are blends .",
    "we list in table  2 all lines that we believe contribute a significant amount of flux to the feature based on the line strengths in the chianti database .",
    "this determination is reassessed after em distributions are estimated , and model spectra can be computed from them and compared with the data .",
    "a few of the features identified in figure  3 are blends of lines of different species ( see table  2 ) .",
    "although we measure counts for these blends and list them in the table , these measurements are not used in the emission measure analysis .",
    "coronal electron densities can be estimated for the two @xmath0  boo stars directly from the o  vii @xmath2721.8 line measurements in table  2 .",
    "there are in fact several he - like triplets in the observed spectral range that are useful for density measurements : si  xiii @xmath276.7 , mg  xi @xmath279.2 , ne  ix @xmath2713.6 , and o  vii @xmath2721.8 . however , insufficient spectral resolution , low signal - to - noise , and blending issues complicate any attempt to use the si  xiii , mg  xi , and ne  ix lines for this purpose @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we focus only on the stronger , better separated o  vii lines here .",
    "the specific line ratio of interest is that of the forbidden line to the intersystem line : @xmath28 . using the results of collisional equilibrium models from @xcite , the measured line ratios for @xmath0  boo  a and @xmath0  boo  b",
    "translate to upper limits of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , as reported in table  3 .",
    "the @xmath0  boo  a limit is consistent with values that @xcite estimate from euve spectra .",
    "densities of about @xmath31 are consistent with spectra of @xmath3  eri , 36  oph  ab , and 70  oph  ab as well , which have activity levels similar to that of the @xmath0  boo stars ( wl06 ) . thus , there is no clear evidence for coronal density differences among moderately active stars observed by _",
    "chandra_.      among moderately active",
    "gk dwarfs with intrinsic x - ray luminosities of @xmath32 , the two easiest to observe from earth are @xmath0  boo  a ( g8  v ) and @xmath3  eri ( k2  v ) , due to their close proximity .",
    "we can see how the coronal temperatures and abundances of these two key stars compare simply by plotting ratios of their coronal line luminosities as a function of line formation temperature , as is done in figure  5 .",
    "the @xmath0  boo  a line luminosities in the figure originate from the line counts measured in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath3  eri luminosities are computed from line counts similarly listed in wl06 .",
    "figure  5 shows that nearly all the line ratios are above one at all temperatures , indicative of @xmath0  boo  a being the more active star .",
    "the ratios are clearly temperature dependent , with the ratio rising from @xmath33 at @xmath34 to @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "this implies a hotter corona for the more active @xmath0  boo  a. this is consistent with previous observations demonstrating correlations between coronal activity and coronal temperature @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing how smoothly and linearly the line ratios rise with temperature .",
    "the lines in figure  5 are divided into those with low first ionization potential ( fip ) and those with high fip . in the solar corona and solar wind ,",
    "elemental abundances are found to be dependent on fip .",
    "relative to the photosphere , elements with low fip ( fe , mg , si , etc . )",
    "are generally found to have coronal abundances that are enhanced relative to elements with high fip ( c , n , o , ne , etc . )",
    "evidence for this effect has been found for some stars of low to moderate activity @xcite .",
    "however , on very active stars the fip effect tends to be either absent , or sometimes an inverse fip effect is observed , where low - fip elements have coronal abundances that are _ lower _ than photospheric @xcite .",
    "thus , for main sequence stars the picture is of the fip effect generally decreasing as activity increases @xcite .",
    "but there are exceptions to this trend , and figure  5 is itself inconsistent with a tight correlation between activity and fip effect , as the lower flux ratios of the high - fip ions in figure  5 demonstrate that @xmath0  boo  a s corona exhibits a stronger fip effect than the less active @xmath3  eri .",
    "we will return to this issue in  4.6 .      in order to quantify the coronal abundances and temperature distributions , we perform an emission measure analysis for @xmath0  boo  a and b based on our measurements of their coronal emission lines .",
    "the em analysis uses version 2.6 of the pintofale software developed by @xcite .",
    "this analysis follows closely that of wl06 in our study of letgs spectra from @xmath3  eri , 36  oph , and 70  oph , so we do not describe it again in great detail here .",
    "figure  6 shows em distributions ( in units of @xmath37 ) for the two @xmath0  boo stars , and compares them with distributions that we previously computed for five other moderately active g8-k5 dwarfs ( wl06 ) .",
    "these distributions are computed using chianti emissivities @xcite , and ionization balance calculations from @xcite .",
    "our line measurements are corrected for interstellar absorption , but the interstellar h column densities towards these stars , including @xmath0  boo ( see table  1 ) , are low enough that this is not an important correction .    for elements with detected lines we can compute coronal abundances in the em analysis .",
    "however , line measurements alone only allow _ relative _ abundances to be computed , and only the shape of the em distribution can be inferred as opposed to its absolute value .",
    "initially , we assume a solar photospheric abundance for fe from @xcite , and all other abundances are computed relative to fe .",
    "the derived @xmath0  boo abundance ratios are listed in table  3 .    in order to compute an _",
    "absolute _ fe abundance , and to properly normalize the em distribution , the line - to - continuum ratio must be assessed .",
    "figure  7 illustrates this process for the case of @xmath0  boo  a. the figure shows a synthetic spectrum generated from the emission measure distribution in figure  6 , assuming an absolute fe abundance of @xmath38}=0.7{\\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\odot}$ ] , which is judged to lead to the best fit .",
    "this is the same as the ratio found for @xmath3  eri ( wl06 ) .",
    "for @xmath0  boo  b , we find a similar value of @xmath38}=0.8{\\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\odot}$ ] ( see table  3 ) .",
    "these results are used to properly normalize the em distributions in figure  6 .",
    "figure  3 displays synthetic spectra of @xmath0  boo  a and b based on the em distributions .",
    "in addition to the dominant first - order spectrum , we also take into account orders 25 in generating synthetic spectra .",
    "both figures  3 and 7 explicitly show the contributions of these higher orders to the total spectrum .    in logarithmic terms , our measurement for @xmath0  boo  a implies @xmath39}=-0.15 $ ] , where @xmath40 is here the solar photospheric abundance of fe .",
    "this measurement can be compared with the @xmath39}=0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.15}$ ] measurement of @xcite based on euve spectra .",
    "at this point it is worth noting that the contributions of weak , unresolved , and unidentified lines to the observed `` continuum '' could easily lead to underestimates of @xmath38}$ ] , so our @xmath38}$ ] measurements could be conservatively regarded as lower limits . given that our measurement is lower than that of @xcite , perhaps there are more lines missing and unaccounted for within the letgs spectral region than in the euve spectral region analyzed by @xcite , presumably leading to an underestimate of @xmath38}$ ] on our part .",
    "nevertheless , both our measurement and that of @xcite show a higher fe abundance in the corona than in the photosphere , where @xmath41}=-0.26 $ ] ( see table  1 ) , consistent with a solar - like fip effect ( see  4.3 ) . in following sections that focus on comparing the coronal abundances of different stars , we avoid the systematic errors involved in computing absolute abundances by comparing only relative abundances ,",
    "specifically abundances relative to fe .",
    "the seven em distributions in figure  6 are superficially similar in appearance , with a dramatic rise at about @xmath34 .",
    "but perhaps the most interesting feature is that all of the distributions show an em peak near @xmath1 , a peak that is particularly convincing for the two brightest stars , @xmath0  boo  a and @xmath3  eri .",
    "the coronal heating on these moderately active stars seems to favor this particular temperature .    the em distribution that @xcite derived for @xmath0  boo  a from euve data agrees nicely with our _ chandra _ distribution .",
    "their peak at @xmath1 is not quite as narrow or prominent , but this may just be a result of the ion - by - ion method that @xcite use to quantify their emission measures . as there is some overlap in the euve and _ chandra_/letgs spectra in the @xmath42    range , there are some lines in common to these two analyses . the most precise way to compare the activity level of @xmath0  boo  a during the euve and letgs observations is to directly compare the line fluxes rather than the derived em distributions .",
    "the letgs / euve line flux ratios have a weighted mean and standard deviation of @xmath43 .",
    "an assessment of the relative flux calibration of euve and letgs by @xcite using white dwarf spectra suggests calibration errors in the opposite direction , with letgs / euve ratios of @xmath44 .",
    "another systematic error that works in the opposite direction is the fact that , unlike letgs , the euve fluxes will be contaminated by emission from @xmath0  boo  b. thus , the below unity value of the average letgs / euve line ratio for @xmath0  boo  a is likely indicative of genuine stellar variability , with the star being somewhat fainter during the letgs observation . however , the very modest level of variability suggested by the letgs / euve comparison is hardly surprising , as the coronal emissions of cool main sequence stars are known to be quite variable on all kinds of timescales .",
    "finally , we can compute broadband x - ray luminosities directly from the letgs spectra .",
    "we first subtract the higher order contributions to the spectra estimated from the em analysis ( i.e. , the green line in figure  7 ) .",
    "we can then combine the corrected spectra with the known first order effective area curve and exposure time to convert counts in our spectra to fluxes . from the flux spectra we can compute x - ray luminosities for any wavelength region within the spectrum . in table  1 , we list luminosities computed in this way for the rosat - like @xmath45  kev ( @xmath46   ) bandpass .",
    "the total @xmath0  boo system luminosity of @xmath47 computed in this way agrees reasonably well with the rosat all - sky survey measurement of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the first order spectra suggest @xmath0  boo  a accounts for about 84.6% of @xmath0  boo s total x - ray flux , compared to the 88.5% contribution to counts in the zeroth order image .",
    "the discrepancy is due in part to the difference between count measurements and flux , the latter of which requires consideration of the effective area of the instrument .",
    "the discrepancy is also due in part to differences in the effective areas for the zeroth order image and first order spectra .      in  4.4 , we compared the em distributions of seven moderately active g8-k5 dwarfs observed with letgs .",
    "we also wish to compare the coronal abundances of these seven stars , in order to first determine if a fip effect exists for these stars , and if so to then compare its magnitude within this stellar sample .",
    "our calculation of abundances in the em analysis assumes that abundances are the same at all temperatures throughout the corona .",
    "figure  5 suggests that this is probably a good assumption , as it shows that the differential fip effect between @xmath0  boo  a and @xmath3  eri is the same throughout the @xmath48 temperature range that dominates the coronal emission measure distributions of these stars .",
    "figure  8 compares the coronal abundances of our sample of stars , plotting the abundances relative to fe , as listed in table  3 .",
    "but the search for a fip effect relies on knowing not just the coronal abundance by itself , but the coronal abundance relative to the photospheric abundance .",
    "thus , in figure  8 we subtract photospheric abundances from the coronal ones .",
    "however , because photospheric abundances are imperfectly known , taking them into account involves numerous assumptions , which we now describe .    in table  1 ,",
    "photospheric abundances measured for @xmath0  boo  a are listed for c , o , mg , si , and fe .",
    "these abundances are quoted relative to solar .",
    "the @xcite analysis from which these abundances are obtained involves a line - by - line comparison of solar and stellar photospheric absorption lines , so these stellar abundances are _ fundamentally _ relative values .",
    "for the purposes of figure  8 , we require absolute photospheric abundances relative to fe , log  [ x / fe]@xmath49 , so we have to combine the abundances in table  1 with some assumed solar abundances .",
    "in figure  8a , we use solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "there are two elements for which no stellar photospheric abundances are available for @xmath0  boo  a : n and ne . since these are high - fip elements , we assume that their abundances relative to the sun are the same as that of another high - fip element , o. in other words , we assume @xmath50 = \\log [ ne / ne_{\\odot } ] = \\log [ o / o_{\\odot}]=-0.09}$ ] ( see table  1 ) . for @xmath0  boo  b there are no independent photospheric abundance measurements , so we simply have to assume @xmath0  boo  b is identical to @xmath0  boo  a in this respect .",
    "similar assumptions have been made for the photospheric abundances of @xmath3  eri , 70  oph  ab , and 36  oph  ab ( see wl06 ) .    the low - fip and high - fip data points in figure  8a are connected with separate dotted lines .",
    "these dotted lines indicate the following curious abundance patterns for all the stars : 1 . mg abundances are always higher than those of si , 2 . ne abundances are always higher than the other high - fip abundances , and 3 .",
    "c and n abundances are intermediate between those of o and ne .",
    "are these abundance patterns telling us something about how coronal fractionation is operating in these moderately active stars ? or are these patterns just a product of assumptions made about the photospheric abundances ?    at least for the high - fip elements ,",
    "the latter of these two explanations seems most likely . in figure  8b",
    ", we explore this further by changing our assumed photospheric abundances .",
    "this figure is like figure  8a , but instead of @xcite solar abundances , we use those of @xcite , with the exception of ne .",
    "photospheric ne abundances provide unique problems , because there are no photospheric ne absorption lines to measure , which means that solar ne abundance measurements actually have to rely on emission lines from the corona , where elements are subject to fractionation processes like those that yield the fip effect . in figure  8b",
    ", we change the assumed photospheric abundance of ne drastically by assuming that the average coronal ne / o ratio of @xmath51 measured by @xcite _ for active stars _ actually represents the real _ photospheric _ abundance of _ all _ cool main sequence stars , as opposed to the much lower solar coronal ne / o ratio of @xmath52 @xcite . in other words , rather than assuming that ne is fractionated from o in active stars but not in the sun , in figure  8b we assume that ne is being fractionated in the atmospheres of inactive stars like the sun , but not in active stars .",
    "theoretical support for this interpretation is provided by @xcite , and a higher solar photospheric ne abundance could also help resolve discrepancies between solar interior models and helioseismological observations @xcite .    with the revised assumptions regarding photospheric abundances discussed above ,",
    "the high - fip abundance patterns seen in figure  8a are largely absent in figure  8b , and the high - fip dotted lines are closer to horizontal .",
    "this result could be used as evidence in favor of the photospheric abundance assumptions being made in figure  8b , as opposed to the @xcite solar abundances being assumed to make figure  8a .",
    "although changing the assumed solar abundances seems to be able to significantly reduce the discrepancies among the high - fip elements , such is not the case for the low - fip elements , where there is little difference in the discrepancy between mg and si in figures  8a and 8b .",
    "thus , presumably coronal fractionation processes really are enhancing stellar mg abundances relative to si in the coronae of these moderately active stars .",
    "@xcite propose that coronal fractionation originates from ponderomotive forces induced by the propagation of alfvn waves through the chromosphere .",
    "these models demonstrate the potential for fractionating mg relative to si in a manner consistent with the observed mg / si ratios . in their sample of early g dwarfs ,",
    "@xcite also generally find high mg / si ratios .",
    "but in a sample of m dwarfs , all of which happen to show inverse fip effects , @xcite find _ low _ mg / si ratios , suggesting this behavior may be spectral type dependent .      for the high - fip dotted lines in figure  8 , the lower the line ,",
    "the higher the coronal fe abundance is relative to the high - fip elements , and therefore the stronger the inferred fip effect .",
    "significant fip effect is apparent for many of the stars , with 70  oph  a s corona possessing the strongest fip bias .",
    "but there is a significant amount of scatter in the level of fip effect found for this sample of stars .",
    "figure  8 suggests the following sequence of decreasing fip bias : 70  oph  a , @xmath0  boo  a , 36  oph  b , 36  oph  a , @xmath0  boo  b , @xmath3  eri , 70  oph  b. the last of these stars , 70  oph  b , appears to actually have a slight _ inverse _ fip effect .",
    "there is some spread of x - ray luminosity within our sample of stars , but there is no correlation at all between x - ray luminosity and fip effect in this sample .",
    "the most luminous star , @xmath0  boo  a , shows a strong fip effect , but the second most luminous , @xmath3  eri , shows only a weak fip effect at most .",
    "the relatively strong fip effect of the most active star in our sample also runs contrary to the general anti - correlation between stellar activity and fip effect that has been reported in the past ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "since the fip effect on the sun is latitude dependent , with the effect being strong near the equator and minimal in the polar regions , one might imagine that perhaps stellar orientation could be a factor in the fip bias observed from a star , assuming coronal abundances on these more active stars also exhibit some sort of latitude dependence",
    ". however , since coronal emission is optically thin , at least half of a star s total emission should be visible from a star regardless of orientation , so it is hard to imagine orientation effects explaining the roughly factor - of-3 variation in fip bias seen in figure  8 .    in our previous paper ( wl06 )",
    "we have emphasized the remarkable difference between 70  oph  a and 70  oph  b , which represent the fip effect extremes in figure  8 despite being similar stars in the same binary system .",
    "one possible explanation that we proposed is that perhaps the fip effect is a time - dependent phenomenon .",
    "the solar example provides a precedent for this , with newly emerged active regions having close to photospheric abundances and only acquiring a fip bias on timescales of days @xcite .",
    "thus , for the stars in figure  8 with little or no apparent fip bias ( e.g. , 70  oph  b , @xmath3  eri ) , perhaps the visible surface of the star at the time of observation was dominated by young active regions , whereas the stars with strong observed fip effects ( e.g. , 70  oph  a , @xmath0  boo  a ) were observed with older active regions .",
    "the time - dependent interpretation can only be tested by observing these stars again , preferably more than once .",
    "but the limited amount of evidence available so far does _ not _ support this interpretation .",
    "abundances computed from euve spectra taken at different times from our letgs data seem to be very consistent with our letgs results , showing a strong fip effect for @xmath0  boo  a , and only a weak fip effect , if any , for @xmath3  eri @xcite .",
    "@xcite looked for abundance variations in multiple observations of the very active k dwarf ab  dor , with the observations encompassing a range of activity levels , and found no such variability .",
    "there does not seem to be a strong case for activity dependence , time dependence , or orientation effects being responsible for the variation in fip bias seen in figure  8 .",
    "there does seem to be a case for there being a spectral type dependence .",
    "the two earliest type stars ( @xmath0  boo  a and 70  oph  a ) have the strongest solar - like fip effect , while the three latest type stars ( 70  oph  b , @xmath0  boo  b , and @xmath3  eri ) have the weakest .",
    "this is explored further in figure  9 , where we first compute the average of the high - fip dotted lines in figure  8b , a quantity we simply call the `` fip bias , '' and then plot this quantity versus spectral type .    in order to broaden the spectral range under consideration , in figure  9 we supplement our measurements with those of early g stars from @xcite and m dwarfs from @xcite . in utilizing measurements from these other papers , we were careful to compute the `` fip bias '' in the same manner that we have for our sample of stars , with the same assumptions about solar photospheric abundances as in figure  8b .",
    "for the @xcite sample , stellar photospheric abundances are available from @xcite , which we take into account , but for the m dwarfs of @xcite there are no such measurements and we have no recourse but to assume that the photospheres of these stars possess solar photospheric abundances .",
    "finally , we have added a point for the sun , using abundances listed in @xcite .",
    "figure  9 shows a remarkably tight correlation of fip bias with spectral type , with the earlier type stars having solar - like fip effects and the later stars having inverse fip effects , though the lack of photospheric abundance measurements for the m dwarfs means that conclusions about them are more uncertain .",
    "the reversal point seems to happen near spectral type k5  v. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time a strong spectral type dependence of fip bias has been claimed . why has this seemingly strong correlation not been recognized in the past ? answering this question requires clearly defining what the sample of stars in figure  9 represents . in short , these are inactive to moderately active main sequence stars with x - ray luminosities of @xmath53 . for solar - like main sequence stars such stars have rotational periods of @xmath54  days and ages of @xmath55  gyr @xcite    most surveys of coronal x - ray emission are dominated by interacting binaries , evolved stars , and other targets that represent extremes of coronal activity , which are commonly observed by x - ray telescopes because they are so bright and easy to detect .",
    "but by avoiding such extremes and focusing solely on more normal stars , we find a very different empirical view of the fip effect .",
    "gone is the kind of activity dependence on which previous authors have focused ( see  4.3 ) , replaced instead with a strong spectral type dependence . in order to emphasize",
    "the lack of activity dependence in figure  9 , consider the two least active stars in the sample : the sun ( g2  v ) and proxima  cen ( m5.5  ve ) . the two g1 stars",
    "right next to the sun in the figure have x - ray luminosities almost two orders of magnitude higher than the sun .",
    "but there is no difference in `` fip bias '' .",
    "likewise , three of the four stars right next to proxima  cen in the figure have x - ray luminosities about two orders of magnitude higher than it .",
    "once again , no difference in fip bias .",
    "there are two stars in the @xcite sample that are not included in figure  9 , because they have @xmath2 and therefore violate our policy of avoiding extremes .",
    "these two stars are 47  cas  b and ek  dra , which both have rotation periods of under three days .",
    "this rapid rotation will probably exist for all main sequence stars with @xmath2 .",
    "if we plotted points for 47  cas  b and ek  dra in figure  9 , they would lie well above the relation defined by the other stars .",
    "rather than proposing that magnetic activity is starting to operate somewhat differently at the activity level of 47  cas  b and ek  dra , thereby yielding a different fip bias , we instead propose that the changes in fip effect are ultimately driven by changes to fundamental stellar properties induced by the rapid stellar rotation .",
    "rotation as rapid as that possessed by 47  cas  b and ek  dra will presumably affect the atmospheric and convection zone properties of the star to some extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interacting binaries and evolved stars will also have substantial differences between their atmospheric properties and those of main sequence stars with identical spectral types .",
    "figure  9 suggests to us that fip bias is tied directly to basic stellar properties of the star , and not any simple coronal property like total x - ray flux or magnetic field strength . within the theoretical paradigm of @xcite , in which alfvn wave propagation through the chromosphere drives coronal abundance anomalies ,",
    "it is possible to imagine that changes in basic stellar properties such as radius , surface gravity , or convective motions could affect these waves and thereby affect the coronal fip bias . _ in short , we propose that the spectral type dependence of fip bias in figure  9 provides a more fundamental insight into the nature and cause of the fip effect than the activity trends that have been explored in the past . _",
    "we have used _ chandra_/letgs observations to study the coronae of the @xmath0  boo binary , and we have compared our results with a previous study of five other moderately active gk dwarfs : @xmath3  eri , 70  oph  ab , and 36  oph  ab . our findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the two stellar components of @xmath0  boo are resolved for the first time in x - rays .",
    "we find that @xmath0  boo  a accounts for 88.5% of the counts in the zeroth order image . for comparison ,",
    "spectral analysis implies an 84.6% contribution to the system s x - ray flux in the rosat - like 0.1 - 2.4  kev bandpass .",
    "2 .   with @xmath0",
    "boo  b detected for the first time in x - rays , we now know it has an x - ray luminosity comparable to stars known to have strong stellar winds , leading to the conclusion that @xmath0  boo  b may account for most of the modest wind observed from the system , with the more active @xmath0  boo  a possessing a surprisingly weak wind despite its active corona .",
    "this strengthens the case for the presence of a `` wind dividing line '' separating moderately active stars with strong winds and very active stars with weak winds , possibly due to the increasing strength of large scale global magnetic fields that inhibit mass loss .",
    "3 .   our emission measure analysis of @xmath0",
    "boo  a and b finds evidence for a narrow peak in em at @xmath1 for both stars , a peak also seen for the other moderately active g8-k5 dwarfs in our sample , indicating that the coronal heating mechanism operating on these stars favors this temperature .",
    "the emission measure analysis provides us with coronal abundances relative to fe .",
    "looking for coronal abundance anomalies requires correcting for stellar photospheric abundances , which in turn involves assuming solar photospheric abundances , since the stellar abundances we use are measured relative to solar .",
    "when we simply assume solar abundances from @xcite , for our sample of stars we find that the high - fip element abundances are inconsistent with each other .",
    "this inconsistency is decreased significantly for all our stars if we instead assume a photospheric ne abundance consistent with stellar coronal measurements from @xcite , and solar abundances from @xcite for other elements .",
    "this is an argument in favor of these latter photospheric abundances , unless there are actual coronal fractionation processes taking place among the high - fip elements that we are erroneously removing .",
    "5 .   among low - fip ions ,",
    "the coronal mg / si ratio is consistently higher than the photospheric ratio for all of our g8-k5 stars , presumably an effect of actual coronal fractionation .",
    "an enhancement of mg relative to si in the corona is predicted by many of the models of @xcite , which are designed to explain solar / stellar coronal abundance anomalies .",
    "however , although @xcite also finds high mg / si ratios for early g dwarfs , coronal mg / si ratios appear to be _ lower _ than photospheric for m dwarfs @xcite , suggesting a spectral type dependence for this coronal abundance ratio . 6 .   with regards to the fip effect ,",
    "our sample of stars exhibit a range of fip bias , with 70  oph  a and @xmath0  boo  a having the strongest solar - like fip effect , @xmath3  eri showing little or no fip effect , and 70  oph  b possessing a slight inverse fip effect . expanding our sample of stars",
    "even further to include early g stars from @xcite and m dwarfs from @xcite , we find that the fip bias correlates beautifully with spectral type , but only if extremely active stars with @xmath2 are excluded .",
    ".   the tight correlation of fip bias with spectral type suggests to us that the nature and causes of the fip effect can ultimately be traced directly to fundamental surface properties . among normal main sequence stars , these change in a very predictable manner with spectral type , explaining the tight correlation in figure  9 .",
    "no such correlation exists for extremely active stars , because many are evolved stars with disparate photospheric characteristics , and in other cases the stellar atmospheres will be affected by rapid rotation or the effects of close binarity .",
