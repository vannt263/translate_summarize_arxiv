    "recent dramatic experimental demonstration of slow and fast light has stimulated considerable interest in the dynamic control of the group velocity of light and in the development of tunable all - optical delays for applications such as optical buffers .",
    "two methods are generally exploited to control optical delay : one of them relies in the use of dispersive devices and the other is based on the modification of the group index of an optical medium .",
    "the first approach is structural , where one aims for finding an optimal structure that enhances the nonlinear response ( through its geometrical properties ) .",
    "some of the most promising systems that explore this approach are fabry - perot resonators , high q cavities , and photonic crystals .",
    "the second approach makes use of nonlinear optical effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , coherent population oscillation ( cpo ) @xcite , raman @xcite and brillouin amplification @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear optical techniques have been extensively studied in atomic systems , however the corresponding counterparts in solid state crystals , fibers , and semiconductors are extremely attractive in order to obtain optical tunable and easily integrable devices like delay lines , and buffers .",
    "eit in a solid has been demonstrated with a rare - earth doped matrix @xcite and in a pr - doped solid at @xmath0 k @xcite .",
    "some of the coherent effects which are present in dilute systems have been also investigated theoretically and experimentally in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , eit was experimentally obtained using exciton and biexciton transitions in a quantum - well ( qw ) structure @xcite .",
    "coherent population oscillations have been shown to be a robust physical mechanism which allows for the variation of group velocity .",
    "cpo produces a narrow hole in the absorption or gain profile as a consequence of the periodic modulation of the ground state population at the beat frequency between a strong control field and a weak probe field sharing a common atomic transition . unlike eit , which is dominated by the coherence dephasing time",
    ", cpo is governed by the population relaxation time and becomes nearly insensitive to temperature .",
    "in addition , cpo is weakly influenced by inhomogeneous broadening in atomic systems in contrast to the quantum coherence effect involved in eit .",
    "slow and fast light at room temperature originated by cpo has been experimentally observed in solid state crystals @xcite , erbium doped fibers ( edfs ) @xcite , photorefractive materials @xcite , and biological thin films @xcite , among others .",
    "slow and fast light in semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soas ) has also been studied extensively in recent years @xcite , because those such systems have the advantage of providing compactness , easy integration with electronic or optical systems , large bandwidth due to fast carrier dynamics , and easy and quick tuning of delay by direct current injection or optical pumping . when a strong control beam and a weak signal beam ( at different wavelengths ) propagate through a soa , beating between the two beams",
    "causes oscillations of the carrier density .",
    "these oscillations create dynamical gain and index gratings in the device .",
    "interaction of the signal beam with the dynamical gratings results in the group index change experienced by the signal .",
    "the group index can be controlled either electrically ( by changing the bias current of the soa ) or optically ( by changing the pump power ) . using this method ,",
    "a group index reduction of @xmath1 has been demonstrated in a compact @xmath2 mm device .",
    "cpo based slow light has also been reported in a multiple - quantum - well structure at low temperature @xcite and in quantum - dot ( qd ) semiconductor optical amplifiers operating at @xmath3 m at room temperature @xcite .",
    "et al _ reported that the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) effect , in conjunction with the cpo effect , plays an important role in a quantum - well soa in the gain regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , slow light at room temperature and with a bandwidth in the range of ghz can be achieved in semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "all these results can be understood by considering the theory of cpo and fwm ( see @xcite and references therein for a review ) .",
    "it has been shown that the delay or advancement achieved saturates with both pump and signal powers and is limited by the carrier lifetime . however",
    ", the effects of the refractive index mediated by wave mixing can be exploited to increase the degree of light control by optical filtering prior to detection @xcite . in the conventional cpo studies in soas ,",
    "the optical beam is modulated in the rf range and delay or advancement of the detected signals are measured depending on the value of the dc bias current , according to be below or above the transparency current .",
    "therefore , current modulation is another mechanism which can be externally controlled to modify the semiconductor optical response . here , we will analyze the possibility of realization of slow and fast light in a soa by considering the simultaneous modulation of the optical beam and the bias current in such a medium .",
    "the dynamics of soas subject to direct current modulation has not been dealt in the slow light context .",
    "the feasibility to periodically modulate the bias current in the rf range has been previously addressed @xcite from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the possibility to modify at will the relative phase of the modulated bias current to the probe field allows us to manage the magnitude of the delay or advancement experienced by the probe field .",
    "by @xmath4 : @xmath5 . [",
    "fig : setup ] ]    we consider a soa driven by an injected current @xmath6 .",
    "a laser field couples the transition between the semiconductor valence band and the conduction band .",
    "typical spontaneous carrier lifetimes are in the order of a few nanoseconds . by adjusting the soa injection current",
    "we may achieve an amplifying / absorbing semiconductor medium at relatively low injection currents , @xmath6 , ranging from a few ma to several hundred of ma .    to model the population oscillation in the semiconductor structure ,",
    "the theoretical starting point relies on considering that an optical beam @xmath7 impinges on the medium .",
    "the optical field is given by    @xmath8    @xmath9 being the angular frequency of the optical field and @xmath10 is the slowly - varying amplitude .",
    "we assume that this field is comprised of a strong dc control beam @xmath11 and two sidebands @xmath12 and @xmath13 separated by the modulation angular frequency @xmath4 which lies within the rf range .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath10 is given by    @xmath14    when this modulated beam goes through the soa ( see figure [ fig : setup ] ) , the three components of the electrical field interact with the carriers in the semiconductor through stimulated emission and will impose a modulation on the carrier density due to the frequency beating between the optical waves . when the beating frequency @xmath4 is small enough that the carriers in the soa can follow the oscillation between the valence band and the conduction band",
    ", the carriers will generate a temporal grating and induce the energy exchange between the control and the sideband fields .",
    "this process creates a spectral hole seen by the sideband fields with width on the order of ghz ( inverse of the carrier lifetime ) .",
    "the carrier density @xmath15 attained for a selected bias current @xmath6 , is obtained by solving the following rate equation :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the electron charge , @xmath18 is the active volume , @xmath19 is the modal gain experienced by the optical field when the current @xmath6 is injected into the active region of the semiconductor amplifier , and @xmath20 is the confinement factor , that is , the fraction of mode energy confined within the active volume @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the angular frequency between the semiconductor valence band and the conduction band , @xmath22 is the carrier lifetime , and @xmath23 is the background refractive index of the material .",
    "the angle brackets denote the averaging operation over the active volume .",
    "equation ( [ eqcampo3 ] ) can be derived from the density - matrix equations @xcite in the rate - equation approximation . in equation ( [ eqcampo3 ] )",
    "the effects of carrier diffusion in the transverse direction have been ignored since the transverse dimensions of the soa are generally smaller than the diffusion length .",
    "in addition , a linear modal gain @xmath19 is assumed to be equal for all the involved waves , an assumption justified since the pump - probe detuning is much smaller compared to the gain - spectrum bandwidth , i.e. , @xmath24 , then the following condition is satisfied :    @xmath25    @xmath26 being the gain cross - section and @xmath27 is the carrier density at which the active region becomes transparent .",
    "these equations neglect ultrafast gain nonlinearities like carrier heating and spectral hole burning , which is a good approximation for moderate modulation frequencies below 20 ghz @xcite .    in the conventional cpo studies in soas , the optical beam is modulated in the rf range and delay or advancement of the detected signals are measured depending on the value of the dc injection current , according to be below or above the transparency current . here",
    ", we will analyze the possibility of improving slow and fast light performance in soas by considering the simultaneous modulation of the optical beam and the bias current in such a medium .",
    "both magnitudes are modulated at the same frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the feasibility to produce modulations in the bias current in the rf range has been previously addressed from a theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "our goal is to force the population oscillations by modulating the bias current @xmath28 , which is described as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , and it is assumed that the modulated current could be out of phase with respect to the modulation of the optical weak probe field by a magnitude @xmath31 , which can be externally changed . in what follows we also assume that the current is independent on the spatial coordinates , i.e. , we will consider a traveling microwave which will be matched exactly with the propagating optical fields . when the modulated beam propagates through the soa , the three components of the electrical fields interact with one another and result in a relative phase shift .",
    "the interaction of the sidebands and the control beam causes cpo , modifies the temporal refractive index , and changes the group velocity of the light signal .",
    "simultaneously , the injected current and optical beams are also coupled to each other through the wave - mixing effects , resulting in an additional phase shift .    to solve equation ( [ eqcampo3 ] ) , we substitute @xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath28 from equations ( [ eqcampo2 ] ) , ( [ eqcampo4 ] ) and ( [ eqcampo5 ] ) , respectively , which results in the following equation :    @xmath32 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined the following normalized currents @xmath33 and the saturation power @xmath34 :    @xmath35    next we assume that the carrier density can be described by a dc term and small ac terms modulated at the same beating frequency , i.e. ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the static carrier density and @xmath38 is the amplitude of the carrier population oscillation of the corresponding sideband .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eqcampo6 ] ) yields the following expressions for the carrier density amplitudes :    @xmath39    where we have defined the following normalized optical powers :    @xmath40    in view of the previous considerations , we arrive at the following equation for the carrier density oscillation :    @xmath41 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    a close inspection of equation ( [ eqcampo12 ] ) reveals that population oscillation works as a temporal grating whose amplitude depends both on the coupling between the dc and the sidebands of the probe field , and on the modulation term of the injection current @xmath42 .",
    "the oscillating part of equation ( [ eqcampo12 ] ) contains two terms : one , which is proportional to @xmath43 , is responsible for the conventional population oscillation observed up to date @xcite and arises from the modulation of the field connecting the optical transition .",
    "the other one , which is proportional to @xmath44 , arises from the modulation imposed to the bias current and incorporates explicitly the relative phase @xmath31 .",
    "we will show that this term is responsible for the probe delay / advancement enhancement .",
    "the response of the system to the weak probe field can be obtained by solving the scalar wave equation :    @xmath45    the field given by equation ( [ eqcampo1 ] ) induces a complex polarization in the medium    @xmath46    where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is a complex polarization coefficient that yields index and absorption characteristics for the dc and side modes waves .",
