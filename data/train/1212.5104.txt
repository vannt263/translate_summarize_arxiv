    "there has been a high - level of research and device interests on both the electronic and optical properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene material@xcite since the report on the first successful isolation of single graphene layers as well as the related transport and raman experiments performed for such layers@xcite . the most distinctive difference between a graphene sheet and a conventional 2d electron gas ( eg ) in",
    "a semiconductor quantum well ( qw ) is the electronic band structure , where the energy dispersions of electrons and holes in the former are linear in momentum space but they become quadratic for the latter . as a result ,",
    "electrons and holes in graphene behave like massless dirac fermions and show a lot of unexpected physical phenomena in electron transport and optical response , including anomalous quantum hall effect@xcite , bare and dressed state klein tunneling@xcite and plasmon excitation@xcite , a universal absorption constant@xcite , tunable intraband@xcite and interband@xcite optical transitions , broadband @xmath0polarization effect@xcite , photoexcited hot - carrier thermalization@xcite and transport@xcite , electrically and magnetically tunable band structure for ballistic transport@xcite , field - enhanced mobility in a doped graphene nanoribbon@xcite and electron - energy loss in gapped graphene layers@xcite .",
    "it has been found that most of the unusual electronic properties in graphene can be very well explained by single - particle excitation of electrons . for diffusion - limited electron transport in doped graphene , the kubo linear - response theory@xcite , as well as the hartree - fock theory in combination with the self - consistent born approximation@xcite , were used .",
    "moreover , the semiclassical boltzman theory was applied in both the linear@xcite and nonlinear@xcite response regimes . for the collective excitation of electrons in graphene ,",
    "previous studies found it has an important role in the dynamical screening of the electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "however , the em response of graphene materials has received relatively less attention , especially for low - energy intraband optical transions@xcite .    for any charged - particle systems , there always exists an electronic coupling based on the intrinsic electron - electron interaction in addition to the system response to an external electromagnetic field or an external electron ( ion ) beam .",
    "this electronic coupling can be either a classical direct coulomb interaction between any two charged particles with no requirement for an overlap of their wave functions , or quantum - mechanical tunneling and exchange coulomb interaction with a tail overlap of their wave functions@xcite . for the same charged - particle systems , there exists another electromagnetic coupling based on the light - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "this electromagnetic coupling results from an induced optical - polarization field in the system due to dipole coupling to an incident light wave . the total electromagnetic field , including the induced optical - polarization field , should satisfy the macroscopic maxwell equations@xcite .",
    "however , the induced optical - polarization field in the system is determined by the microscopic density - matrix equations@xcite .",
    "therefore , a self - consistent theory is required for studying the electromagnetic response of such a charged system to incident light .",
    "physically , a statistical ensemble average of dipole moments in an electronic system with respect to all quantum states will give rise to an induced optical - polarization field@xcite .",
    "this provides a connection between the microscopic density - matrix equations and the macroscopic maxwell equations@xcite .",
    "the former describes the full electron dynamics excited by a total electromagnetic field , including optical pumping , energy relaxation , optical coherence and its dephasing , and carrier scattering with impurities , lattice and other charged carriers@xcite .",
    "when the incident field is weak , a self - consistent linear - response theory to the total electromagnetic field ( not just the incident light ) can be applied to an electronic system as a leading - order approximation .",
    "experimentally , the inelastic light scattering@xcite and electron - energy - loss spectroscopy@xcite were widely used for probing the bulk and surface electronic coupling , respectively , in a charged - particle system . on the other hand , the elastic light scattering@xcite and the optical absorption spectroscopy@xcite were extensively applied for studying the surface and thin - film electromagnetic coupling in either a conductive or a dielectric system . for a smooth conductive surface , only electronic excitations in the long - wavelength limit",
    "can be coupled to an incident light wave , where a drude - type model is usually adopted in spectroscopy analysis . for a patterned conductive surface in the deep sub - wavelength regime , on the other hand",
    ", surface light scattering can be used to explore surface electronic excitations in the system beyond the long - wavelength limit , where a wavenumber - dependent ( nonlocal ) optical response of electrons , which is crucial for the near - field distribution and the landau damping of plasmons@xcite , must be employed to analyze the light reflectivity and transmissivity spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model in which a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and a doped linear graphene micro - ribbon array ( electronically isolated from each other ) are put on the surface of a doped semi - infinite semiconductor substrate .",
    "therefore , we expect to see the excitations of the localized surface plasmon and the conventional 2deg plasmon , as well as the 2d dirac - fermion plasmon excitation , in such a system in the presence of an incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "more interestingly , we expect there to exist strong electromagnetic couplings among these three collective excitations in the deep sub - wavelength regime , i.e. with an array period much less than the incident wavelength , and these couplings can be externally tuned by the doping densities in a graphene layer or in a qw , as well as by the driven 2deg in the qw or by the induced bandgap in the graphene .",
    "the existence of an bandgap in the graphene not only modifies the landau damping of plasmons@xcite , but also introduces the interplay between dirac - like and schrdinger - like electrons in the electromagnetic response . to demonstrate",
    "the predicted strong and tunable electromagnetic coupling among three plasmon excitations in our model system , numerical calculations and their comparisons are presented for both the transmissivity and reflectivity spectra with different configurations of our model system and various array periods , ribbon widths , chemical potentials of graphene , and induced bandgaps in graphene .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sect2 ] , we derive the self - consistent maxwell equations and the density - matrix linear - response theory within the random - phase approximation for our model system which consists of a combined 2deg in an inas qw and a linear graphene micro - ribbon array doped by electrons on the surface of a semi - infinite @xmath1-doped gaas substrate . this self - consistent theory , along with the detailed expressions for a linear matrix equation in appendix  a , is then applied to study the transmissivity and reflectivity spectra of an incident plane wave for various structural - geometry and material parameters . in sec.[sect3 ] , numerical results , including the @xmath0polarized far- and near - field transmissivity spectra as well as the transmitted @xmath0polarized e - field intensity distribution , are presented to demonstrate and explain the existence of an externally - tunable electromagnetic coupling among the localized surface plasmon , 2deg plasmon and massless graphene plasmon excitations in our system .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these results are briefly summarized in sec.[sect4 ] .",
    "it is shown in fig.[f1 ] that the half - space @xmath2 is air with the refractive index @xmath3 whereas the half - space @xmath4 is occupied by a doped semi - infinite gaas substrate with a dynamical dielectric function @xmath5 which supports a localized surface - plasmon ( sp ) mode . at the interface @xmath6",
    ", there are a periodic electron - doped graphene micro - ribbon array ( gmra ) and an inas quantum well ( qw ) for a 2deg .",
    "optically , the gmra and qw can be considered to be in one plane .",
    "the reason for this is that the sheet thickness is much smaller than the wavelength and the decay length of the impinging light .",
    "they can , however , still be electrically separated from each other by an energy barrier@xcite . a plane - wave electromagnetic ( em ) field incident from @xmath2",
    "is diffracted by the gmra into both the reflection ( @xmath2 ) and transmission ( @xmath4 ) regions .",
    "the diffraction modes of the em field are modulated by the induced optical polarization at the interface with the gmra , which will be electromagnetically coupled to sp and 2deg plasmons .",
    "we assume that the gmra is periodic in the @xmath7 direction , and seek the solutions based on a plane - wave expansion for a single frequency . setting @xmath8 for simplicity and denoting the transverse electric component of the em field below the interface by @xmath9 and above by @xmath10",

    "in addition , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eqs.([e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are determined by the following dispersion relations for transverse em fields    @xmath24=\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } n_a^2\\\\ \\epsilon_s(q_n,\\beta_{2,n},\\,\\omega ) \\end{array}\\right]-q_n^2\\ , \\label{e3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath26 is the dielectric function of the doped semiconductor substrate , and we require that @xmath27 so as to ensure a finite value for the reflected or transmitted em field at @xmath28 .    formally , if we keep only the term with @xmath29 in the summations in eqs.([e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , the gmra in our model will simply change to a graphene sheet .",
    "for this situation , after removing the doping in the gaas substrate and the 2deg in the inas qw , the formalism in this paper will reduce to the previous ones@xcite for a transverse em response from a single graphene sheet .    in the long - wavelength limit",

    "optically , however , the gmra and 2deg can both be regarded as two - dimensional sheets since their thickness are much less than the em - field wavelength considered .",
    "therefore , the four independent boundary conditions for transverse em fields at the interface @xmath6 can be written as@xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the induced sheet optical - polarization field ( related to the polarization current ) while @xmath50 is the induced sheet conduction - current density . furthermore , we can write @xmath51 as@xcite    @xmath52    where    @xmath53=\\chi_1(q_n,\\,\\omega)\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\left.c_x(q_{n}\\right|\\omega)\\\\ \\left.c_y(q_{n}\\right|\\omega ) \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath54 \\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\left.c_x(q_{n^\\prime}\\right|\\omega)\\\\ \\left.c_y(q_{n^\\prime}\\right|\\omega ) \\end{array}\\right]\\ .",

    "are both taken into account by the second term of eq.([e16 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the coupling between a spatially - dependent total em field and the electron dynamics in an energy band , due to the non - locality in an optical response of electrons , is also included in eq.([e16 ] ) .    similarly , using ohm s law",

    "for an incoming @xmath0polarized em field , we get @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the magnetic component and @xmath70 is the permittivity of free space .    combining the sheet optical polarization in eq.([e15 ] ) and the sheet - current density in eq.([e17 ] ) , we can write the optical - response function for @xmath71 in a compact form given by    @xmath72    where @xmath73 .    we notice that there exists an anisotropy in the polarizability of a graphene nanoribbon along the longitudinal and transverse directions@xcite , respectively , and it can be attributed to a subband quantization due to finite - size effect .",
    "however , this anisotropy can be neglected for the width of ribbons in the micrometer range . in other words , we adopt in this paper the isotropy of the micro - ribbon array instead of anisotropy of the nanoribbon array . within the random - phase approximation , for graphene ribbons in the micrometer range",
    "we calculate the nonlocal ( @xmath74 ) optical - response function @xmath75 as@xcite    @xmath76    where the non - retarded limit with @xmath77 has been used and @xmath78 is defined as    @xmath79    @xmath80 is the surface area of a graphene micro - ribbon , @xmath81 is the fermi - dirac function for thermal - equilibrium electrons , @xmath82 is the kinetic energy of electrons , and @xmath83 represent the valence ( @xmath84 ) and conduction ( @xmath85 ) bands of dirac cones in a graphene layer .",
    "the dirac - cone model only holds for crystal momentum that is not too large .",
    "in fact , the energy band structure ceases to be a cone above about 2.5 ev . for our medium - high - density sample used in this paper ,",
    "the fermi momentum is much less than the momentum separation between valleys at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons in different valleys will be significantly suppressed due to this large momentum separation .",
    "additionally , the electron - phonon mediated inter - valley scattering also requires a temperature higher than room temperature .",
    "since we assume very low temperature for electrons in our model , this inter - valley scattering may be justifiably neglected .",
    "the 2d dielectric function @xmath88 for graphene micro - ribbons can be obtained by@xcite @xmath89 in the non - retarded limit with @xmath90 being the dielectric constant of graphene materials .",
    "in addition , the optical conductivity @xmath91 of graphene ribbons can be calculated from eq.([e19 ] ) within the linear - response theory , i.e. @xmath92 $ ] . in a similar way",

    "the coulomb interaction between electrons will induce a self - energy , leading to an energy - dependent fermi velocity beyond the random - phase approximation@xcite .",
    "however , this energy - dependent behavior becomes significant only around the dirac point@xcite .",
    "for our samples in this paper with a very high doping concentration , we expect this effect is minimized .",
    "therefore , we have neglected the coulomb renormalization to the graphene fermi velocity in eq.([level ] ) .",
    "correction to the self - energy comes from correlation effects .",
    "however , this correction becomes significant only at low densities , as it occur , for example , when there is wigner crystallization .",
    "however , the sample considered in this paper is of medium - high - density concentration , where correlation effects may be neglected .",

    "we note that the induced bandgap may be attributed to either photon dressed - state effects by circularly polarized light or to a substrate .",
    "there exist two main sources of disorder in graphene ribbons , i.e. , edge roughness and charged impurities . since wide micro - ribbons are considered in this paper , we can neglect the edge roughness .",
    "this leaves the charged impurities as the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "the existence of charged impurities is also able to induce a self - energy , leading to a deformed density of states around the dirac point of graphene@xcite .",
    "however , for our medium - high - doping samples , the screening length of impurity potential is small , leading to a negligent effect on the density of states in graphene .",
    "moreover , with the added gap in eq.([level ] ) , the charged impurities create localized states only in the range between @xmath105 and @xmath101@xcite .",
    "since our transmission is not substantially affected up to @xmath106ev ( see fig.11 in sec.iii ) and the induced states by localized impurities are well above the terahertz regime of interest in this paper , we can neglect this effect here . for impurities , the interference or localization effect on",
    "the conductivity becomes important only for very high impurity concentrations .",

    "( [ e18 ] ) , facilitates the mixing between the em - field specular and diffraction modes , which enables transferring the peak weight from a near field to a far field .",

    "however , the em - field reflectivity is found to be enhanced ( not shown here ) in this inverted structure for the range of photon energies shown in the figure . in this case , only one very weak peak at @xmath238mev is visible for the inverted structure , which is attributed to an order - of - magnitude lower electron density in the qw compared to that in a graphene micro - ribbon . at the same time , the sp - related peak shifts from @xmath207mev to @xmath239mev due to switching from the qw - sp coupling to the graphene - sheet - sp coupling .",

    "since a finite @xmath101 leads to an effective mass ( @xmath102 ) for electrons close to the band edge , its effect on @xmath191 is expected to be substantial ( see fig.[f9 ] ) as @xmath242 .",
