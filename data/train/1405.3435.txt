    ", one can verify that at low redshifts these two models produce density contrasts that differ substantially at large scales , while being similar at smaller scales ( see fig .",

    "the structure of the ec isw curve around z=1 is just an artefact of our simple model for torsion with a nonanalytic behaviour at z=1 .",
    "the compendium of all our results can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the @xmath0 model can not simultaneously fit the large and the small scale parts of the planck tt spectrum , while the ec can rectify this deficiency owing to the presence of the new rotational degrees of freedom ( torsion ) that partially cancels the large mass density ( @xmath45 ) when clustering matters , i.e. the rotation ( centripetal force ) acts opposite to the attractive force of gravity , ( 2 ) the presence of the isw effect is observed in planck data @xcite , but with the unknown sign ; the very small low multipoles of the planck tt spectrum imply the negative contribution of the isw @xcite , thus in accord with the ec model , ( 3 ) the peculiar velocities are larger at the galaxy and galaxy cluster scales for the ec than @xmath0 cosmologies at low redshifts .",
    "these conclusions are robust and are qualitatively valid for the reasonable variation of the clustering model parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the two different analyses of the planck peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters @xcite are still not conclusive as to whether the data are consistent with the @xmath0 model or not .",
    "our final remark is that the first planck results favour a description of the universe with the anisotropic models .",
    "the @xmath0 and the inflationary paradigm can not fulfil severe phenomenological requirements . we show that the ec cosmology with the new rotational degrees of freedom can resolve almost all of the @xmath0 model deficiencies . however , the n - body numerical simulations , including the angular momenta of the cdm halos and their feedback onto the background cosmic geometry , have to be applied within the ec gravity .    100 c.  l.  bennett et al . , astrophys",
