    "is a young , oxygen - rich supernova remnant ( snr ) in the southern sky . the recent discovery of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) ( hughes et al . 2001 ) and 135-ms period radio pulsar ( camilo et al .",
    "2002 ) have greatly increased interest in this object , which , because of its youth , ejecta - dominated nature , and relative closeness , is sometimes considered the southern analog of cassiopeia a. here we report on the nature of the pulsar and discuss the evolutionary state of the snr and pwn , especially as regards their interaction .",
    "the compact x - ray source cxou j112439.1@xmath0591620 in  was observed with the  high resolution camera ( hrc ) in timing mode for 50 ks on 2001 july 14 .",
    "no pulse was detected in a coherent fft of the entire light curve for the events ( 1324 in total ) extracted from within a @xmath2 radius of the point source . a search at pulse frequencies near the radio parameters yielded a significant detection of an x - ray pulsar ( figure 1 ) , confirming that the radio pulsar , x - ray pulsar , and compact central x - ray source are one and the same .",
    "agreement between the ages of the pulsar and snr , make a virtually ironclad case for an association between  and snr .",
    "the x - ray pulse is single peaked and broad ( figure 2 ) . of the total number of events in the light curve , only about 130 are pulsed .",
    "the x - ray image in the vicinity of the pulsar is complex : in addition to an unresolved source there is a small , extended , elliptically - shaped nebula .",
    "in fact the nebula dominates the flux from this region ; only approximately 160 events ( time - averaged ) come from the unresolved pulsar . comparing the pulsed to the time - averaged flux",
    "indicates that the x - ray pulsar is highly pulsed , @xmath365% .",
    "a more complete report on the properties of the x - ray pulsar and its compact nebula can be found in hughes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "in a search for an optical counterpart , the pulsar was observed at the ctio blanco 4-m telescope with the mosaic ii camera on 2002 april 17 .",
    "exposures were taken in one narrow - band h@xmath4 and four broadband filters for approximately 1 hour each .",
    "standard reductions were carried out and the images were registered to the celestial sphere . no optical counterpart was detected ( figure 3 ) down to limits in b , v , r , and i of 26.8 , 26.4 , 26.2 , and 25.5 , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic optical luminosity for psr 1124@xmath05916 , accounting for distance and extinction , is much below the luminosities of the three young pulsars crab , psr b0540@xmath069 and psr b1509@xmath058 , although the limit is still above the optical luminosity of psr b0833@xmath045 in vela . in terms of the efficiency for converting spin down energy into optical luminosity ,",
    "these new limits for psr 1124@xmath05916 imply a rather low value : @xmath5 .",
    "again this falls far below the values found for the three young isolated pulsars in snrs , but is an order of magnitude or so higher than the value of @xmath6 for the vela pulsar ( caraveo , mereghetti , & bignami 1994 ) .",
    "one of the most important issues regarding the evolutionary state of  concerns the relationship between the pwn , the free - streaming ejecta , and the reverse shock .",
    "by examining the pressures in the various regions of the remnant we have obtained some insight into this question .",
    "the pressure in the pulsar wind nebula has been estimated in two rather different ways ( hughes et al .",
    "2003 ) : using the location of the pulsar termination shock and from the minimum energy condition applied to the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "values obtained were @xmath7 dyne @xmath8 ( minimum energy ) and @xmath9 dyne @xmath8 ( termination shock ) .",
    "although it is possible that the pressure is as high as the latter value , in practice this would require the nebula to be almost entirely particle dominated with an energy content 40 times that of the minimum energy condition .",
    "any value of pressure much higher than this would be very difficult to accommodate given what we currently know about the age and energetics of .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to us to conclude that the true pressure in the pwn lies at or below @xmath10@xmath11 dyne @xmath8 .",
    "recently , a study of the thermal properties of  has been carried out by park et al .",
    "regions of normal composition , corresponding to shocked interstellar or circumstellar medium ( ism / csm ) , were identified based on near - solar fitted abundance ratios . using the densities and temperatures derived from the spectral fits for these regions ,",
    "an emission geometry , and the assumption of equal electron and ion temperatures , an estimate for the thermal pressure of @xmath12 dyne @xmath8 was obtained .",
    "there are numerous knots of x - ray emitting ejecta throughout the remnant .",
    "figure 4 shows the  acis - s spectrum of one such knot located slightly south of the pulsar .",
    "the knot shows strong emission lines of ne ( @xmath101 kev ) , mg ( @xmath101.3 kev ) , and si ( @xmath101.8 kev ) .",
    "the spectrum can be fully described with emission contributions from only these three species and oxygen ; the data do not require the presence of any other elemental species .",
    "we identify this as a knot of pure ejecta from the hydrostatic burning layers of the @xmath10@xmath13 progenitor star ( park et al .",
    "2003 ) . in a similar manner",
    "to before we estimate the thermal pressure in this knot to be @xmath14 dyne @xmath8 .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in these pressure estimates , the most critical assumptions we have made , e.g. , that the plasma is unclumped and that electrons and ions share the same temperature , would tend to result in higher pressure estimates if relaxed .",
    "the pressure in the shocked ejecta and ism / csm is at least a factor of two and more likely one to two orders of magnitude higher than the pressure in the pwn .",
    "this is strong evidence that the reverse shock has not yet begun to encounter the pwn .",
    "furthermore , our ism / csm , ejecta , and pwn pressures are in remarkably good numerical agreement with dynamical models for a pwn interacting with freely expanding ejecta ( see figure 4 of van der swaluw et al .",
    "finding evidence for the interaction between the pwn and the free streaming ejecta would be an important confirmation of this picture .",
    "there should also be a reservoir of cold unshocked ejecta between the pwn and the reverse shock .",
    "one way to detect and investigate the composition of this material would be through absorption line studies of , for example , cold fe or si against the hard continuum emission of the pwn .",
    "this may be possible to do using  and should become routine with future higher sensitivity missions like the .",
