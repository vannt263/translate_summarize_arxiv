    "classical perturbations in the de  sitter geometry die out in accordance with the `` no - hair '' theorem .",

    "in inflationary cosmology , classical perturbations which could exist prior to inflation die out .",
    "however , one of the striking features of the quasi - de  sitter inflationary stage is that the quantum fluctuations of the light ( minimally coupled to gravity ) scalar field @xmath18 are unstable and inevitably generate scalar metric perturbations @xmath126 @xcite , so that the quasi - de  sitter metric ( [ flat ] ) becomes perturbed @xmath127    if the spacetime is not static ( timelike killing vector does not exist ) , as in the inflationary geometry ( [ perturb ] ) , the situation with the horizon thermodynamics is not quite so simple .",
    "the event horizon and apparent horizon are in general different surfaces , and the killing horizon does not exist , so the notion of surface gravity is ill - defined .    fortunately , in the case of spherical symmetry one can define the mass ( energy ) @xmath68 inside the spherical region of the physical radius @xmath128 by @xmath129 .",

    "if we take into account variation of background values like @xmath43 and @xmath194 with time , time - dependence and statistical properties of the horiazon area given by ( [ wiggles ] ) or equivalently ( [ wiggles2 ] ) will be more complicated .",
    "we will discuss this issue below .",
    "in this paper we calculated the apparent horizon area and geometrical entropy of quasi - de  sitter geometry , which describes an inflationary stage , and the energy flux of the scalar fields through the apparent horizon .",
    "issues related to de sitter thermodynamics are commonly considered in the static de sitter coordinates , where an observer at the origin is surrounded by the event horizon and detects a thermal flux of temperature @xmath22 .",
    "we work with the geometrical entropy @xmath112 of the apparent horizon in the time - dependent planar de - sitter coordinates adopted in inflationary cosmology , which admit a simple generalization to the quasi - de  sitter geometry and , most importantly , admit a clear interpretation of fluctuations generated from inflation .",
    "the slow roll of the inflaton field leads to slow change in the horizon radius . assuming that the energy flux of the rolling scalar field through the horizon changes the geometrical entropy @xmath27 , we reproduce the einstein equation ( [ einst ] ) which relates @xmath195 and @xmath29 .",
    "other background scalars @xmath69 which are subdominant during inflation give similar contributions to the energy flux @xmath196 , independent of their potentials .",
    "this change of the quasi - de  sitter horizon radius due to the rolling scalar field is very similar to the increase of the mass of a black hole due to the accretion of a background scalar field rolling towards the minimum of its potential @xmath197 .",
    "this type of accretion , which can be described analytically with the delayed field approximation , can be realized for runaway potentials of the background scalar field or for very light massive fields .",
    "we present this material here mainly to illustrate similar calculations for rolling scalars in quasi - de  sitter geometry , as the astrophysical effects of accretion of a rolling scalar onto a black hole that we considered ( say quintessence and astrophysical - size black holes ) are negligibly small .",
    "oscillating heavy scalar field accretes onto black hole very differently as quasi - particles .",
    "inflationary , quasi - de  sitter stage erases classical inhomogeneities which could exist prior to it",
    ". however , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field ( as well as other light scalars minimally coupled to gravity ) are unstable and produce long - wavelength fluctuations of the inflaton field @xmath18 which behave as classical inhomogeneities at scales larger than the hubble patch of size @xmath198 .",
    "fluctuations @xmath18 generate long - wavelength scalar metric perturbations @xmath30 .",
    "geometrical quantities , like an area of the apparent horizon , acquire corrections due to the scalar metric perturbations .",
    "we calculate the energy flux of the inhomogeneous scalar field @xmath199 through the apparent horizon and the change in the apparent horizon area of the perturbed metric multiplied by its ( geometrical ) temperature @xmath200 . again , equating @xmath201 , we show that this thermodynamics relation is compatible with the linearized einstein equations which relate @xmath30 and @xmath202 .",
    "thus , as long as the einstein equations hold , generation of the inflaton fluctuations is in full agreement with the variation of the entropy of the quasi - de  sitter horizon .",
    "therefore , in the picture of rolling inflaton with quantum fluctuations generated with time , we did not find that quantum fluctuations may violate holographic bound during inflation .",
    "( notice that the fluctuations from inflation are described by squeezed states , which do not carry entropy @xcite . in simple terms , locally the effect of fluctuations is just a wiggling of the local hubble parameter ) .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that in the `` hot tin can '' picture the entropy of fluctuations may violate holographic bound during inflation . of free light scalars produced during inflation would have @xmath203 times bigger entropy and uv cutoff proposed in @xcite would depend on @xmath203 . ]",
    "the issue of inflaton fluctuations in the `` hot tin can '' picture is not clear to us . in theory of inflation ,",
    "scalar field fluctuations are usually considered in the time dependent metric ( [ flat ] ) , as it was described in section [ sec : fluc2 ] .",
    "bunch - davies vacuum corresponds to the thermal state in the static coordinates . on the other hand , in the static de  sitter coordinates , discussion of the quantum field theory is usually restricted to thermal radiation from the horizon , usually in terms of the detector response . thermal radiation associated with the de  sitter horizon",
    "is related to any free quantum field , scalar fields with mass @xmath10 and any coupling to gravity , vector fields etc . , the difference will be only in the radial dependence of the wave functions ( `` gray - body factor '' ) .",
    "on the other hand , instability of quantum fluctuations from inflation occurs only for very light minimally coupled scalar fields",
    ". it will be interesting to understand what is relation of the quantum field theory in the `` hot tin can '' picture , and the instability of fluctuations from inflation .",
    "for this it will be essential to work with regularized vev @xmath204 .    as we already mentioned , in the picture of rolling scalar field with accumulating inflaton fluctuations , which we adopt in the paper , holographic bound and quantum fluctuations from inflation are compatible .",
    "a lesson from our calculations is that in the quasi - de  sitter geometry with slowly rolling scalar field , the horizon area , or geometrical entropy , are perturbed by the scalar metric fluctuations according to the formulas ( [ wiggles ] ) , ( [ wiggles2 ] ) .",
    "this means that the area of the horizon for an ensemble of the different hubble patches is not the same but is a statistical variable by itself . for small metric perturbations ( of order of @xmath205 ) , its mean value is @xmath206 , where @xmath43 is slowly decreasing background value , but dispersion around the mean value is defined by @xmath207 , which growth with time .",
    "equivalently , we can talk about statistical properties of the local hubble values @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "notably , this picture is converging with the stochastic description of inflation in terms of the probability distribution of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "probability to have the value of inflaton field @xmath34 in quasi - static regime is @xmath208 and can be interpreted in terms of entropy @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this entropy is identical to the geometrical entropy @xmath210 . during inflation and rolling of @xmath34 the wiener process of accumulating fluctuations @xmath18 ( or similarly perturbations of @xmath30 ) changes distribution of @xmath211 .",
    "distribution of the horizon areas of different hubble patches , defined by the local values of the hubble parameters , depends on the background slow roll regime and the regime of accumulation of fluctuations , both of which depend on the model of inflation @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to understand further the correspondence between stochastic approach to inflation and geometrical entropy ( [ wiggles ] ) , ( [ wiggles2 ] ) .",
    "so far we discussed small metric fluctuations @xmath30 or small local variations of @xmath7 .",
    "however , in the chaotic inflationary scenario for large enough values of @xmath34 , variations of @xmath7 due to the quantum jumps of @xmath18 can be large and lead to the self - reproducing inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "we would like to draw attention to this regime ( which is still below the planck energy density ) and to note that `` adiabatic '' geometrical thermodynamics which we considered in this paper is not applicable here .",
    "indeed , consider the hubble patch where @xmath7 is increasing due to the quantum jumps .",
    "increase of @xmath7 is not compatible with the classical einstein equation ( [ einst ] ) .",
    "consequently , quantum jumps are not compatible with the horizon thermodynamics ( of a single hubble patch ) since @xmath27 does not hold either .",
    "geometrical entropy of the local hubble patch is decreasing .",
    "however , we have to take into account the entropy of all hubble patches .",
    "self - reproduction of inflating regions looks like a chain reaction , which is described by the branching diffusion process @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to gary felder , valeri frolov and alexey starobinsky for discussions and suggestions .",
    "we are especially grateful to andrei linde for numerous valuable discussions and nemanja kaloper for valuable discussions and clarifications .",
    "this research was supported by the natural science and engineering council of canada and the canadian institute for advanced research .",
    "here we briefly discuss astrophysical applications of the results of section [ sec : bh ] .",
    "one of the most important examples of slowly rolling scalar field is a homogeneous cosmological scalar field , whose evolution is given by the field equation @xmath212 with the hubble friction .",
    "this type of fields appears , for instance , in the cosmological models of quintessence . to dominate at the present cosmological stage while avoiding gravitational clustering ,",
    "the value of @xmath34 should be of order of the planck mass @xmath213 , and its effective mass @xmath214 very small , @xmath215 , where @xmath43 in the present day hubble parameter .",
    "quintessence may interact gravitationally with black holes of different masses , ranging from tiny primordial black holes to astrophysical black holes of solar masses to supermassive black holes .",
    "accretion of quintessence onto a black hole is given by the formula ( [ rate1 ] ) .",
    "scalar field velocity @xmath216 is defined by its equation of motion ; however , the kinetic energy @xmath29 can not exceed the total energy density of the universe @xmath217 . substituting this upper limit in ( [ rate1 ] )",
    ", we estimate the rate of the black hole growth due to the accretion of the rolling cosmological scalar field @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the gravitational radius of the black hole , @xmath198 is the size of the universe , and we switched to planck units @xmath220 . thus , accretion of cosmic scalars including quintessence is absolutely negligible for all types of astrophysical black holes . for primordial black holes at the moment of formation , when the ratio @xmath221 is of order of unity , the study of section [ sec : bh ] of rolling scalar field accretion is not applicable directly , as the black hole spacetime would be significantly different from schwarzschild in this case .",
    "even if one believes the equation ( [ rate1 ] ) in this regime , it would seem unlikely that the accretion of quintessence can cause explosive growth of primordial black holes ( contrary to some claims in the literature ) .",
    "for this to occur , the seed primordial black hole would have to be much bigger than the cosmological horizon if the quintessence is subdominant .",
    "it is interesting to take into account the back reaction of an accretion on the evolution of the cosmic scalar field itself . from the energy balance",
    "we obtain a correction to the hubble friction term due to the accretion of rolling scalar onto black holes @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the spatial density of black holes .",
    "this correction is proportional to the filling factor of black holes , i.e. the fraction of volume occupied by black holes .",
    "the last is tiny so that the effect of the interaction of a rolling scalar field with black holes is negligible .",
    "rolling scalar field interacting with a black hole also emerges in the context of the brans - dicke or more general scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "a general spherical spacetime is described by the metric @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the metric on a two - manifold with coordinates @xmath61 , and @xmath128 is the physical radius of spherical slices .",
    "the field dynamics is given by the einstein - hilbert action , which in spherical symmetry can be dimensionally reduced to yield @xmath226 +   2 ( \\nabla\\rho)^2 + 2\\right ] + \\rho^2 { \\cal l}_{\\text{matter } } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the einstein equations for spherically symmetric spacetime ( [ eq : ap : metric ] ) follow from the above action by varying it with respect to the two - metric @xmath227 and the two - scalar @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath228 component of the einstein equations is @xmath229 + \\rho^{-2 } g_{ab }   [ ( \\nabla\\rho)^2 - 1 ] = 8\\pi g\\ , t_{ab}.\\ ] ] by subtracting the ( two - dimensional ) trace , this equation can be written in a more convenient form @xmath230 where we have defined @xmath231 \\ .\\ ] ] in the case of schwarzschild black hole , @xmath118 coincides with the surface gravity at the horizon .",
    "we will continue to use the same notation since @xmath118 defined in ( [ temp ] ) will enter the thermodynamics relation in the more general case .    in spherical symmetry , it is possible to define a local mass function @xmath232 by @xmath233 the change in mass is related to the flux of matter given by the stress - energy tensor @xmath234 . to see this ,",
    "let us take the derivative of @xmath235 @xmath236 and use the einstein equation ( [ eq : ap : ee ] ) we derived above to obtain @xmath237 this is the differential mass formula in a spherically symmetric spacetime @xcite .",
