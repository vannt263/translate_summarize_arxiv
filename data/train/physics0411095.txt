    "an important consideration in the design of any optoelectronic device is the efficiency with which light can be extracted .",
    "a fundamental limitation on all light emitting materials with refractive indices greater than the collection medium is that light emitted outside the critical angle with respect to the collection medium will be trapped by total internal reflection .",
    "one successful approach that overcomes this problem is to texture the surface of devices so that trapped light can be scattered into the critical angle of extraction @xcite .",
    "this approach works well for inorganic devices where the scattering surface is very close to the emission region @xcite . in organic based leds the textured surface",
    "is generally separated from the emission zone by the thickness of the substrate ( @xmath1 mm ) .",
    "although light trapped in the substrate can be extracted @xcite , the most significant improvements require high refractive index substrates that are matched to the emission region @xcite .",
    "introducing wavelength size texturing closer to the active layers is generally not feasible as this would compromise the device s electrical properties",
    ".    the use of a microcavity to redistribute emission geometrically has been demonstrated in both organic @xcite and inorganic material systems @xcite . despite their effectiveness",
    ", microcavities only provide enhancement over a limited spectral range and are significantly more elaborate in design .",
    "a more recent demonstration has shown that low refractive index hydrophobic aerogel materials can be used to successfully enhance extraction efficiency in organic based leds @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "trapped light from an emitting region ( @xmath2 ) is encouraged to couple evanescently through the higher index indium tin oxide ( ito ) anode ( @xmath3 ) to a thick aerogel layer ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "angular resolved intensity enhancements near a factor of @xmath5 were reported ; likely to be less in terms of actual power enhancement .",
    "a theoretical study of volumetric light scattering in such low refractive index substrates shows that significant improvements can result in combining these two enahcnement mechanisms @xcite . here a similar approach is examined which combines the successful texturing / scattering approache with the use of low refractive index layers .",
    "a scattering layer , consisting of high refractive index dielectric spheres embedded in a low refractive index material , is placed beside the anode of an organic device as depicted in fig .",
    "this is possible because of the surface flatness and uniformity of the scattering layer , developed by mitsubishi chemicals corporation , that does not interfere with the electrical properties of the device .",
    "the distance between the emission region and this layer is comparable to the wavelength of light allowing efficient scattering of low order guided modes that constitute a large proportion of trapped light .",
    "scattered light is effectively redistributed within the lower refractive index medium from where it can be extracted with greater efficiency .",
    "consider the channels through which emission is extracted or trapped within the device .",
    "light originates via spontaneous emission from the emission region in either radiation modes which can escape the device with efficiency , @xmath6 , or guided modes that are trapped , @xmath7 .",
