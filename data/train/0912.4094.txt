    "the mixing among pseudoscalar mesons and glueballs is of great theoretical interests and significance for understanding the dynamics and hadronic structures .",
    "study on the mixing has lasted for several decades , not only because of its importance , but also the difficulties caused by both theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "as is well understood , the mixing is caused by the qcd anomaly and related to the chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "definitely , one would be able to gain a better insight into the dynamics , if the mixing parameters are more accurately determined",
    ". many measurements on the processes where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are involved , have been carried out to fix the mixing parameters .",
    "the mixing of @xmath0 is described in different forms , i.e. with different eigen - bases .    in the su(3 ) quark model @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mixtures of @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are su(3 ) singlet and octet states respectively @xcite , @xmath10 and the mixing angle @xmath11 was fitted in a range of @xmath12 to @xmath13@xcite .",
    "bhattacharya and rosner s recent work @xcite suggests that the data of the decays of @xmath14 and @xmath15 into two light pseudoscalar mesons seem to favor a smaller octet - singlet mixing angle @xmath16 .    in the quark content basis , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be further written as mixtures of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we refer this mixing as scenario - i in this work .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath25 @xcite corresponds to @xmath26 in this scenario .    in the history",
    ", there have been various ways to determine the mixing angle(s ) .",
    "feldmann et al .",
    "@xcite summarized the issue and listed several possibilities to extract the mixing angle(s ) from the experimental data . by fitting the ratio of nonleptonic decay widths @xmath27}{\\gamma[j/\\psi\\rightarrow\\eta\\rho]}$ ] the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath28 , while by fitting the decay widths of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the value of @xmath31 was set as @xmath32 . in terms of @xmath33}{\\gamma[j/\\psi\\rightarrow\\eta\\pi]}$ ] @xmath34 was obtained . using the ratio of decay widths of @xmath35}{\\gamma[d_s\\rightarrow\\eta e\\nu]}$ ] @xcite and the form factors given in ref.@xcite @xmath31",
    "is fixed as @xmath36 @xcite . with the cross section of scattering processes @xmath37 and @xmath38 one had @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration @xcite measured the ratio of the annihilation processes @xmath41+meson(@xmath42 or @xmath43 ) and @xmath44+meson(@xmath42 or @xmath43 ) and achieved @xmath45 . based on the ratio @xmath46}{\\gamma[j/\\psi\\rightarrow\\eta\\gamma]}$ ] the value of @xmath31 was obtained as @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the results seem a bit dispersive , but they are consistent with each other for the accuracy the present experiments can reach .",
    "feldmann et al . obtained a weighted average of the @xmath31 value as @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , is not the end of the story , since the qcd anomaly , if it causes the mixing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , also results in a mixing of @xmath49 with gluonium of the quantum number @xmath50 .    as one extends the picture to involve glueballs , a new scenario which we refer as the scenario - ii ,",
    "was suggested in refs . @xcite as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a pure gluonium state and the physical state @xmath53 was identified as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the definition of the mixing angles in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from that adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath55 scheme was used to obtain @xmath56 and other parameters by fitting the data of several radiative decays such as @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath59 .",
    "the results are @xmath60 and @xmath61 if one sets @xmath62 as a free parameter .",
    "recently , the branching ratios of @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been measured @xcite and the collaboration @xcite obtains a new upper limit of @xmath65 .",
    "even though the missing energy of the produced neutrino may bring up certain uncertainties , semi - leptonic decay modes have an obvious advantage over the radiative and non - leptonic decays .",
    "since the contamination from the final state interaction is absent in semi - leptonic decays , the theoretical calculation is more reliable and the physical quantities extracted from data , such as the mixing angles , would be closer to reality .",
    "this is an ideal opportunity to determine the structure of @xmath66 , @xmath67 extract the mixing angle(s ) of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) from data .",
    "this advantage motivates us to study the mixing via the semi - leptonic decays alone .    as was indicated above , in most cases , the mixing angle and the model parameters",
    "were not simultaneously determined by fitting solely one type of data .",
    "since all the relevant processes involve hadron transitions , one needs to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements which are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd , in terms of phenomenological models .",
    "therefore extraction of the mixing is somehow model dependent . however , if one can determine the mixing angle(s ) solely from one type of processes , the model dependence would be alleviated because he can just employ one phenomenological model to deal with all the concerned reactions , e.g. the model parameters and the mixing angles are fixed altogether . indeed , in this way , we can expect that the model dependence which is unavoidable , could be reduced to minimum .",
    "our strategy is following .",
    "we will concentrate on the study of the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath68 and @xmath15 . at the tree - level ,",
    "only the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) component of @xmath71 contributes to the transition @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the amplitude at the quark level can be obtained in terms of the weak effective theory , so the key point is to calculate the hadronic transition matrix elements .",
    "concretely , we are going to use the light front quark model ( lfqm ) to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements .",
    "it is believed that the lfqm is a relativistic model which has obvious advantages for dealing with hadronic transitions where light hadrons are involved @xcite .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly lorentz invariant and expressed in terms of the fractions of internal momenta of the constituents which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "applications of this approach have been discussed in some details by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and their results are in good agreement with data .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite we explored the structure of @xmath74 via the transition @xmath75 in the lfqm .",
    "however , in the approach , there are a few parameters to be fixed : the @xmath76 values in the hadron wave - functions .    in our scheme , we let the mixing angle and @xmath76 be free parameters , when we fit the data , we obtain the mixing angle and the @xmath76 values simultaneously . in this way , we  extract \" the mixing angle directly from the data on the semileptonic decays of @xmath68 and @xmath15 . at the present @xmath77 and @xmath78 have been measured , but the data are not enough to determine mixing angles of @xmath79 and glueball . once @xmath80 is measured in the future at bes , it would be optimistic that one will be able to further determine the mixing structure which is extremely valuable for getting insight into the physics picture of light hadrons and probably the glueballs .",
    "thus so far , we only concern the scheme i where only @xmath0 mixing exists .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , in section ii we present the form factors of @xmath81(@xmath82 ) which are evaluated in the lfqm , then we calculate the corresponding decay rates and by fitting the data we gain the mixing angle and the model parameters altogether .",
    "section iii is devoted to our conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section we are going to calculate the decay widths of @xmath83 and @xmath85 in terms of the lfqm .",
    "the crucial task is to evaluate the form factors of @xmath86(@xmath87 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied @xmath88 in the lfqm , thus the corresponding formulas can be directly used in this work .",
    "the transition diagram is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : lfqm ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in this work , the input parameters for quark masses are directly taken from @xcite as @xmath89 gev , @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 gev . from the experimental results for decay constants @xmath92 , the parameters for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are fixed to be @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 gev @xcite .",
    "totally , there are five free parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath31 to be fixed .",
    "it seems that we do not have enough equations to determinate all these parameters .",
    "however , the @xmath101 is a parameter in the gaussian wave function whose value only depends on the quark flavor ( q or s ) , but not on the characters of the hadron , therefore two relations @xmath102 and @xmath103 hold .",
    "the relations are also deduced in the appendix b where we do not make any special assumption on them . by these relations",
    "we reduce the number of unknowns to three . from the three decay modes ,",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath31 and @xmath104 .",
    "the mixing angle is fit to be @xmath105 where the errors are from the experiment .",
    "the parameters @xmath76 are @xmath106 gev , @xmath107 gev .    now , let us discuss the theoretical uncertainties in our used light front quark model . here , we only address the errors coming from the phenomenological parameters .",
    "the numerical results are not sensitive to the variance of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in @xcite",
    ", it is found that the variations of decay constants of @xmath110 and @xmath111 with parameters @xmath76 is nearly a linear relation .",
    "one can ascribe the uncertainties from @xmath112 to experimental errors of @xmath113 .",
    "for the quark masses , we made a variation of their values by 10% and explore the uncertainties of predictions .",
    "we found that the numerical numbers are not sensitive to @xmath114 .",
    "in particular , with variations of @xmath114 , the errors of @xmath31 is only @xmath115 .",
    "the uncertainties from charm quark mass @xmath116 is in a controllable region , @xmath117 . combing them",
    ", we have an error @xmath118 in determination of @xmath31 , this is the main error of our approach . after considering the experimental error , the mixing angle is determined to be @xmath119 .",
    "su(3 ) breaking is a substantial effect in @xmath0 mixing . in our approach",
    ", we have included their effects in differences of quark masses @xmath120 and",
    "@xmath121 ; @xmath76 parameter differences in @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    ". using these values , we plot the dependence of the form factor @xmath124 on @xmath125 in the physical region of @xmath126 in fig . 2 and we estimate @xmath127 which is lower than the experimental upper bound @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "using the formula of eq .",
    "( [ bpp1 ] ) in appendix and the above parameters we calculate the central value of the decay constants @xmath129 mev , @xmath130 mev , @xmath131 mev and @xmath132 mev .",
    "these values are obtained by fit to the experiment .",
    "they are very close to the results @xmath133 mev , @xmath130 mev , @xmath134 mev and @xmath135 mev given in ref.@xcite where two mixing angles @xmath136 and @xmath137 are used for the mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is noted that our result extracted solely from the data on the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath68 and @xmath15 is consistent with the previously determined weighted value @xmath138 @xcite and @xmath139 @xcite within a reasonable error tolerance . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors also used the data @xmath140 to determine the mixing angle . in this work",
    ", we employ an alternative model to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements .",
    "moreover , nowadays there are more data available , which enable us to make more accurate estimation on the @xmath0 mixing .    in principle",
    "we will be able to fix the mixing angles @xmath141 and @xmath142 in eq.([mixing12 ] ) simultaneously as long as a sufficiently large database on the semileptonic decay modes is available .",
    "because of absence of the final state interactions , the semileptonic decays have obvious advantages for determining the properties of the produced light hadrons , such as the structure of @xmath74 , @xmath0 mixing and even a mixing of pseudoscalar mesons with glueball , over other modes from the theoretical aspect . indeed , moreover , for the semileptonic decays , one only needs to calculate the hadronic transition elements where only one final hadron is involved . instead , besides the complication caused by the final state interaction , the evaluation of hadronic matrix elements of the non - leptonic decays is much more difficult because there are two hadrons in the final state .",
    "to do the job , the factorization scheme may be invoked and more ambiguities are raised by the scheme .    in this work",
    "we extract the mixing angle of @xmath6 and @xmath7 by the semileptonic decays @xmath143 and @xmath144 . at first",
    "we calculate the form factors of @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the lfqm where the mixing angle of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the parameters @xmath76s were free",
    ". then we compute the rates of the semileptonic decays @xmath143 and @xmath147 . equating our theoretical derivations with the data we obtain @xmath148 , @xmath106 gev and @xmath107 gev .",
    "we estimate @xmath149 .",
    "as indicated above , there are three free parameters including the @xmath0 mixing in our model - dependent calculations , and we fix them simultaneously by the data of @xmath150 and @xmath151 in our scheme i. if in the future @xmath152 can be accurately measured ( not just an upper bound ) , we will be able to test our theoretical prediction of @xmath153 which is made in our scheme i. if the data are consistent with our estimation , it implies that our scheme i is valid , e.g the mixing between @xmath0 with gluonium states is small . instead , if there is an observable discrepancy between our theoretical prediction on @xmath65 and the data , one needs to further consider the scheme ii where the mixing between @xmath0 is accounted , and by the data , we can determine the mixing angles @xmath141 and @xmath142 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "we wish our experimental colleagues to carry out measurements on @xmath154 and further improve the accuracy of the measurements of semileptonic decays .",
    "of course , the branching ratios of semileptonic decay modes are smaller than that of non - leptonic modes , and due to the existence of a neutrino ( antineutrino ) , the missing energy would make the event re - construction more difficult",
    ". however , the obvious advantage of the semileptonic decays for determining the properties of the light hadrons , would be the reason to urge our experimental colleagues to conduct more precise measurements .",
    "it is worthwhile .",
