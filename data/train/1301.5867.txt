    "the differences with ckmfitter are more subtle , as both are frequentist approaches .",
    "the essential difference between the two interval estimation methods is the following : ckmfitter uses the conventional change in @xmath16 from its minimum value to determine confidence regions .",
    "the motivation for the scan method is to test the hypothesis that the standard model is correct , against the alternative that it is incorrect .",
    "the statistical test adopted is the @xmath16 test .",
    "hence , this motivation is reflected in our confidence region determination , in which we use the method of inverting a test acceptance region  ( as described in standard statistics texts , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the confidence regions are determined by comparing @xmath16 values with a critical value instead of looking for a change in @xmath16 .",
    "specifically , the algorithm for a @xmath111 confidence region in @xmath112 dimensions of a @xmath113 dimensional parameter space with @xmath114 measurements is as follows .",
    "first , determine the acceptance region , at the @xmath5 significance level , by determining the critical value @xmath115 such that @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the hypothesis of the standard model , and @xmath118 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath112 is added back here because the critical region for the test is constructed for each point in the @xmath112-dimensional subspace of the full parameter space .",
    "the confidence region is then given by all those points in the @xmath112 dimensional parameter subspace for which @xmath119 , under @xmath117 .",
    "for the theoretical uncertainties , ckmfitter makes an implicit scan by incorporating a term in the likelihood function for each theoretically uncertain quantity .",
    "the term equals 1 or 0 depending on whether the theory parameter is in the theoretically `` allowed '' region or not .",
    "a modified algortihm is also available , which makes a smooth transition between 1 and 0 . in the scan method",
    ", the scan over theoretical parameter space is explicit .",
    "no theoretical term is included in the likelihood function .",
    "instead , each point in the theoretical parameter space of interest is treated as a possible value , and the fit procedure is performed at each such point .",
    "depending on the value of the minimum @xmath16 , the regions determined by either method may be larger or smaller .",
    "if the best fit gives a high @xmath113-value , then the scan method regions will be larger .",
    "on the other hand , if the best fit gives a low @xmath113-value , the ckmfitter regions will be larger . in the present instance , the best fit @xmath113-value is 0.76 , hence the scan method confidence intervals will tend to be larger than those from ckmfitter . reflecting its origins in goodness - of - fit testing , the scan method region goes to null in the limit where the fit fails at the specified confidence level . in the limit of no theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "both methods give valid frequentist confidence regions , with different properties .",
