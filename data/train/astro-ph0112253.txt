    "after many years of research the origin of cosmic rays remains unclear .",
    "the composition of cosmic rays at high energies is not well known and even the energy spectrum is rather uncertain .",
    "progress is limited primarily because cosmic rays above 10@xmath4 ev can only be observed , with reasonable statistics , through the extensive air showers of secondary particles that they produce in the atmosphere .",
    "the primary energy and mass of the initiating cosmic ray have to be deduced from the form and particle content of the showers .",
    "this , unfortunately , requires use of an air shower model , based on our knowledge of electromagnetic and hadronic particle interactions and particle decay and transport in the atmosphere .",
    "these models suffer from poor knowledge of the hadronic and nuclear interactions at high energies and so the results inferred from the measurements are , to some extent , model dependent .    at haverah park ,",
    "uk , a 12 km@xmath5 air shower array of water - cherenkov detectors , was operational from 19671987 to measure cosmic rays in the energy range @xmath6 ev to @xmath7 ev . here",
    "we present a re - analysis of data taken during 19741987 . at that time",
    "the energy reconstruction of individual air shower events and the energy spectrum were obtained with a shower model of hillas @xcite , that gave an empirical description of high - energy interactions .    in recent years a variety of more sophisticated models for hadron production , based on gribov - regge theory , have become available which attempt to include quantum chromodynamics in a consistent way . the qjsjet98 model ( quark - gluon - string model with jets )",
    "@xcite for high energy interactions , often used within the corsika code @xcite developed for monte carlo calculations of air showers , has been rather successful in describing consistently a variety of experimental results over a wide energy range .",
    "tools for detailed simulation of the response of the detectors to particles of different type , energy and impact angle have also become available , e.g. geant @xcite , that allow us to study details of the measuring process in a manner inconceivable 25 years ago .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a re - analysis of haverah park data on the energy spectrum using the qgsjet98 model in the corsika code and with geant simulations . in the following paper , in this volume",
    ", we present also new results on the cosmic ray mass composition @xcite .",
    "the haverah park extensive air shower array was situated near leeds , uk , at an altitude of 220 m above sea level , corresponding to a mean atmospheric depth of 1016 g @xmath8 , at 53@xmath9 58@xmath10 n , 1@xmath938@xmath10 w. the particle detectors of this array were made up of water - cherenkov modules of two types .",
    "the majority , which were used throughout the experiment , were galvanised iron tanks 2.29 m@xmath11 in area and filled to a depth of 1.2 m with water brought from a nearby borehole in magnesium limestone .",
    "all tanks were lined with a white diffusing material ( ici darvic ) .",
    "the water in each tank was viewed with an emi photomultiplier ( emi 9618yb ) with a 5 inch diameter s11 sb / cso photocathode held so that it just dipped into the water .",
    "large area detectors were achieved by grouping together a number of modules in huts with roofs having a thickness less than 4 g @xmath8 .",
    "the signals from the modules were added locally within each detector hut .",
    "the number of cherenkov photons released in a water tank is closely proportional to the energy deposit of the shower particles in the water .",
    "shower electrons and photons , with typical energies of 150 mev , are effectively stopped , whilst muons ( with a typical energy of 12 gev ) penetrate the tank and release a number of photons that is proportional to their track length in the water .",
    "as most of the energy of an air shower at ground is carried by the electromagnetic particles , the use of deep detectors is very effective for measuring the energy flow in the shower disc .",
    "the densities of cherenkov photons per unit detector area ( cherenkov densities ) were recorded in terms of the average signal from a vertical muon ( 1 vertical equivalent muon = 1 vem ) per square metre .",
    "this signal corresponds to approximately 14 photoelectrons for haverah park tanks .",
    "[ array ] shows the overall layout of the haverah park array  a more detailed description of the array is given in @xcite .",
    "the signals from 15 of the 16 tanks in one a - site hut were summed to provide the signal used for triggering and for the density estimate .",
    "one tank in each hut was used to provide a low gain signal , used when the signal from the other 15 tanks is saturated .",
    "an overall trigger was formed if , in the central detector ( a1 ) and in at least 2 out of the three remaining a - sites ( a2a4 ) , a density of @xmath12 vem m@xmath13 was recorded .",
    "the trigger rates were monitored daily over the life of the experiment .",
    "after correction for atmospheric pressure variations , the trigger rates were stable to better than 5% .    in the energy range of interest here , the detectors located in a ring of 2 km from a1 do not usually show signals above threshold .",
    "however they are important for the analysis because they constrain the air shower core position inside this ring .",
    "relevant density information is also obtained from three 9 m@xmath5 detectors at 150 m from the center of the array .",
    "a relatively densely - packed sub array of 1 m@xmath5 detectors surrounding a1 ( not shown in fig . [ array ] ) was not used in this re - analysis , as these detectors ran only for 4 years .",
    "the experimental data for each event include the densities and arrival times of shower particles for each detector .",
    "the times were measured relative to the start of the pulse in a1 , with an experimental measurement error of @xmath14 20 ns . typically in an event the 7 central detectors have signals recorded . for each event the arrival direction @xmath15 , @xmath16 , core position x , y , and the water - cherenkov signal density at a core distance of 600 m , @xmath0(600 ) , were obtained . in total",
    "the database comprises 84455 events in the zenith angle range between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and with energies @xmath19 ev . for the present work these data were re - analysed using more detailed monte carlo calculations and improved reconstruction algorithms , as described below .",
    "the haverah park data analysis procedure has three steps : firstly , the direction of the incoming cosmic ray is determined ; secondly , the core location is estimated from the pattern of cherenkov densities and @xmath0(600 ) is determined ; thirdly , the primary energy is estimated from the relationship between @xmath0(600 ) and the primary energy obtained by simulations .",
    "the zenith and azimuthal arrival directions are determined by fitting a plane to the particle arrival times recorded at the detectors a1 to a4 .",
    "the error in the zenith angle determination was estimated from the uncertainties introduced by the timing measurements .",
    "the absolute pointing accuracy was confirmed by comparisons with the directions of high energy muons observed in a magnetic spectrograph located at a1 @xcite and by comparison with estimates made with an air - cherenkov array and with an array of scintillator detectors centered on a1 @xcite .",
    "the zenith angle error is adequately represented by @xmath20 , for @xmath21 and the azimuth angle is always smaller than that ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we use in this work the directions determined in the original haverah park analysis .",
    "once the arrival direction has been found , the detector coordinates are projected into the shower plane , i.e. the plane normal to the shower axis passing through a1 . subsequently the core location ( x , y ) and @xmath0(600 ) in the shower plane",
    "are obtained . for this purpose",
    "we have adopted a shape for the lateral distribution function that was directly measured @xcite .",
    "the lateral distribution of the water - cherenkov density @xmath0(r ) , in units of vem / m@xmath13 , in the core distance range r = 50800 m is given by the function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is in metres , @xmath25 is a normalization constant , and the slope parameter @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this dependence is in good agreement with simulation results . due to the small number of densities usually available , it was not possible to fit values of @xmath26 reliably for each individual shower .",
    "however , the value of @xmath0(600 ) is only weakly dependent on @xmath26 , which is one of the reasons for the choice of @xmath0(600 ) as the ground parameter from which we derive the primary energy",
    ". specifically the mean value of @xmath0(600 ) increases ( decreases ) by only 15% if the reconstruction is made using a value of @xmath26 which is 0.3 larger ( smaller ) than the predicted value .",
    "such a shift in the value of @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath28 3 @xmath29 in terms of the intrinsic shower - to - shower fluctuations of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we have ignored the dependence of @xmath26 on energy , which is measured to be 0.165 @xmath28 0.022 per decade .    the core position ( x , y ) and the shower size are fitted by comparing the measured densities with those predicted ( from eq .",
    "[ ldf ] ) , i.e. by minimising : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the measured densities at detector location @xmath32 and @xmath33 are uncertainties related to the density measurement and particle fluctuations . by differentiating eq .",
    "[ chisqr ] the value of @xmath25 which minimises @xmath34 is : @xmath35 the @xmath34 minimization technique is a special case of the maximum likelihood method of parameter estimation .",
    "if the probability distribution function for each observed density is a gaussian with mean value @xmath36 and variance @xmath37 then @xmath34 is related to the likelihood l according to : @xmath38 in this case , however , the weights depend on x , y , @xmath25 and so eq . [ normcte ] is no longer strictly valid .",
    "another constraint on the @xmath34 formula is that it is applicable only if the measurement uncertainty is well described by a gaussian distribution .",
    "when the number of expected particles is small it is more appropriate to use poissonian statistics when calculating the likelihood function .",
    "furthermore densities below trigger threshold or above saturation level can not be used in the @xmath34 method , but it is straightforward to incorporate them in the likelihood method . as the measurement uncertainties are not known sufficiently well to justify a full maximum likelihood analysis we have adopted a compromise solution , as described below .    for a given core position and zenith angle",
    "we assume a lateral distribution function ( with the value of @xmath26 fixed to the mean value for that given zenith angle ) and calculate the shower size constant @xmath25 with eq .",
    "[ normcte ] .",
    "we use only detectors with densities above threshold and below the saturation density .",
    "the variances @xmath33 used are obtained by adding in quadrature all the possible sources of error @xcite : @xmath39 where the first term is the absolute measurement uncertainty ( @xmath40 is the relative uncertainty ) , the second term is a constant uncertainty in @xmath0 due to digitisation , and the third and fourth terms correspond to the poisson uncertainty in the number of particles and cherenkov photons , respectively . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants which depend on the type of the detector , @xmath43 is the effective area of the detector , and @xmath44 is the `` poisson factor ''  the effective number of real particles or photons that constitute the signal of a vertical equivalent muon .",
    "the poisson factor can be @xmath45 because of the soft electromagnetic component and falls off with distance from the shower core because of the increasing number of muons relative to electrons and photons at greater distances .",
    "it is also dependent on zenith angle , as the muon to electromagnetic ratio varies with atmospheric depth . to investigate the uncertainty due to poissonian fluctuations in the number of particles making up the water cherenkov signal ( as well as that due to fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons ) signals from two adjacent detector modules",
    "were recorded for the same shower .",
    "the value of @xmath44 could be obtained with this investigation but limited statistics preclude an accurate determination of the dependence of @xmath44 on zenith angle and core distance .",
    "a general form for @xmath44 is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fraction of the cherenkov signal from muons , and @xmath48 is the number of electromagnetic particles needed to make up the signal of a vertical muon . the value of @xmath44 used here was obtained from the parameterization of @xmath47 as function of zenith angle and core distance in @xcite with @xmath48=10 .",
    "once we have obtained the value of @xmath25 , the predicted cherenkov densities are calculated using @xmath49 and converted to particle numbers by multiplying with @xmath44 .",
    "the likelihood function is calculated at this stage , including detectors above threshold and below saturation and using poissonian or gaussian statistics , depending on the particle number .",
    "a gradient search of the core position ( x , y ) is carried out to minimise the likelihood function . once the optimum core position and @xmath25 are found ,",
    "the assumed lateral distribution function is modified by varying @xmath26 around its expected value . for each value of @xmath26 a gradient search",
    "is performed to obtain new values of @xmath25 and core position .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated for varying starting values of the core position to avoid trapping in local minima .",
    "the minimum value of the likelihood function for all values of @xmath26 , x , y , and @xmath25 is assumed to be the _ true _ minimum .",
    "the value of @xmath0(600 ) is then obtained from the normalization constant @xmath25 and the corresponding value of @xmath26 .    two main differences between this analysis and the original haverah park algorithm",
    "should be noted : @xmath44 varies with zenith angle and core distance and @xmath26 is allowed to vary in the fitting procedure , whereas both were considered constant originally . from the total event sample we re - analysed more than 8000 events with originally reconstructed core positions @xmath50 m away from a1 .",
    "after the new core reconstruction a cut at 300 m was performed to ensure 100% trigger probability at energies above @xmath51 ev for all particle types , allowing a simple and accurate calculation of the effective area for the reconstruction of the energy spectrum .    fig .",
    "[ event ] shows the density map of a typical event in the shower plane .",
    "only the inner part of the array is displayed .",
    "a detailed geant simulation of the propagation of electrons , gammas , and muons at different zenith angles through haverah park tanks has been performed .",
    "cherenkov photons are ray - traced until they are absorbed or fall on the photocathode of the photomultiplier .",
    "the wavelength dependence of light absorption in the water and the reflectivity of the tank walls have been taken from @xcite but were normalised to the best estimates for the haverah park tanks .",
    "the peak values for haverah park are 83% for the wall reflectivity , 15 m absorption length in the water , and 22% photomultiplier quantum efficiency .",
    "the thorn / emi ( 9618yb pmt ) wavelength dependent quantum efficiency was taken from the manufacturer s specifications .",
    "the results of this simulation for particles that enter the tank vertically are summarised in fig .",
    "[ tank_egm ] .",
    "the mean signal for a typical vertical muon ( @xmath52 gev ) was measured to be 14 photoelectrons @xcite , and this number is well reproduced by the simulations .    by contrast , the mean energy of electrons and gamma rays in vertical showers are around 40 and 10 mev respectively at about 1001000 m from the shower core .",
    "these calculated values are consistent with experimental evidence from haverah park work @xcite . convolving the energy spectrum of electrons and gamma rays with the response given in fig .",
    "[ tank_egm ] , yields mean signals of 2.6 and 0.9 photoelectrons for electrons and gamma - rays , respectively , at a typical core distance of 600 m.    specific simulations for different zenith angles ( @xmath17 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath18 ) and azimuth angles ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath56 ) were performed to search for any change of the signal of electromagnetic particles due to border effects . for the mean photon signal ,",
    "variations with angle were found to be less than 15% , and for electrons the variations are even smaller .",
    "the electromagnetic particles usually get completely absorbed in the tanks and the output signal is just proportional to the input particle energy .",
    "thus , their contribution to the total signal at larger zenith angles is suppressed compared to muons because of the reduction of the projected area of the detectors .",
    "this effect can be included easily in the simulations if the mean signal from an electromagnetic particle at a given energy is independent of the arrival direction .",
    "the measured electromagnetic signal can also vary within a hut because of the varying azimuthal orientation of the tanks ( see fig .",
    "[ array ] ) . for a given zenith angle",
    "the mean signal of the electromagnetic particles for the three azimuth angles was simulated . using this mean value ,",
    "the error in the electromagnetic signal when considering any azimuth is less than 7% .",
    "the signal due to muons , is proportional to the track length . for a given muon density",
    "the signal is also proportional to the tank area and as a result the mean signal is proportional to the tank volume and independent of the arrival direction of the shower relative to the tank . at large",
    "zenith angles the muon signal comprises a smaller number of muons ( due to projected area ) but with longer track length .",
    "therefore poisson fluctuations in the total number of muons going through a tank become more important at large zenith angles and this is accounted for in the simulations .",
    "to give an idea about the relative importance of the different contributions to the total water - cherenkov signal , we have found from simulations that the ratio of the signal from muons to the total water - cherenkov signal is 0.55 ( 0.42 ) at 600 m from the shower core for an iron ( proton ) shower arriving at a zenith angle of 26@xmath9 with an energy of 0.4 eev .    in the following section we use the mean signals from muons , electrons and photons at different energies and angles to produce the water - cherenkov lateral distribution function for individual events from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the response of the tank to a particle at a given energy and arrival direction follows a distribution that is not always gaussian . although it would be more accurate to sample this distribution in the simulations to obtain the signal produced by a particle , we use the mean value of this distribution .",
    "we have investigated these differences in the density range of interest for this work : the systematic effect was found to be less than a 1% .",
    "the haverah park data were originally analysed by comparison with shower simulations of hillas and collaborators @xcite , using an ad - hoc hadronic interaction model . subsequently",
    "accelerator measurements and the theoretical understanding of soft hadronic interactions have much improved , and the computing power available today allows much more detailed models to be used . at present",
    "the corsika program is a standard tool for air shower simulations , and it is used by a variety of different experiments over the energy range from 110@xmath57 gev .",
    "corsika uses egs4 ( electron gamma shower code ) @xcite for the simulation of the electromagnetic interactions , and features a detailed simulation of particle propagation and decay .",
    "different models for the simulation of hadronic interactions are available within corsika . for this work",
    "the qgsjet98 @xcite model was selected .",
    "qgsjet is based on gribov - regge theory of multi - pomeron exchange to model high - energy soft hadronic interactions , at present the only viable theoretical approach to model cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the qgsjet model also contains a treatment of hard collisions and the production of mini - jets , which become dominant at very high energy collisions , and allows a realistic simulation of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the interaction parameters are tuned to fit a wide range of accelerator results and to provide a secure extrapolation to higher energies .",
    "corsika / qgsjet is fast and is able to describe a wide range of experimental cosmic ray results : from cherenkov telescopes at @xmath58 ev @xcite , over measurements of the hadronic , muonic and electromagnetic shower components in the knee region @xcite , to lateral distributions and arrival times at @xmath59 ev @xcite , and air showers at @xmath7 ev @xcite .",
    "showers initiated by primary protons and iron nuclei were simulated at zenith angles of @xmath17 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath18 with an energy of @xmath60 ev . for a zenith angle of @xmath54 showers with 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.6 , and 3.2",
    "eev were also produced .",
    "statistical thinning of shower particles was applied at the level of 10@xmath61 e@xmath62 with a maximum particle weight limit of 10@xmath63 e@xmath62/ev . for each set",
    "100 showers have been simulated , yielding a total of 3600 showers .",
    "the corsika output was convolved with the tank response described in the previous section .",
    "we then fitted the resulting lateral distribution function for muons and electromagnetic particles to the function given in eq .",
    "[ ldf ] for each individual shower . to increase the statistics",
    "further each shower was thrown 100 times on to the array with random core positions ranging out to 400 m from the centre of the array .",
    "the zenith angles for these multiple monte carlo events is obtained by fluctuating the zenith angle of their parent event with the uncertainties described in the previous section .",
    "the muon and electromagnetic densities , including the poissonian fluctuations , at the location of each of the detectors is obtained with the parametrizations described above .",
    "a check is made as to whether a simulated event fulfills the array trigger conditions and , if so , the densities are fluctuated according to measurement errors and recorded in the same format as real data .",
    "each simulated event is then analysed with the algorithm described in the previous section to obtain the core position and @xmath0(600 ) .",
    "events with reconstructed cores at distances larger than 300 m from the central detector are rejected .",
    "it was found that the number of events in which the cores are falsely reconstructed to be outside 300 m is smaller than the number of events in which cores are falsely reconstructed to be inside 300 m. however , this is effect is small : at 0.4 eev an increase of less than 1% in the number of events that pass the core distance cut is obtained , rising to 2% at 3.2 eev .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0(600 ) and the primary energy is used to determine the energy of an event .",
