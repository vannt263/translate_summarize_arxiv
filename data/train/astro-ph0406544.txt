    "most theoretical attempts to discriminate between the redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath0 concluded that the history from first - generation star formation to the gunn - peterson transparency lasts a long time ( cen 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; whyithe & loeb 2003 ; holder et al .",

    "this problem has recently been studied by using the lognormal ( ln ) formalism ( bi et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al .",
    "considering that the jeans length changed greatly before and after the reionization , a self - consistent calculation with the ln model yields a general picture that the redshift @xmath0 should be significantly larger than @xmath1 , where @xmath0 means the era that ionized regions are fully overlapped .",
    "the thermal history of the universe around the reionization can be roughly divided into three epochs : ( 1 ) the cold dark age @xmath10 , ( 2 ) the hot dark age @xmath11 , and ( 3 ) the bright age @xmath12 . with the cosmological parameters given by wmap and cobe",
    ", the hot dark age lasts about @xmath13 .    in the epoch @xmath14 , the fraction of ionized hydrogen @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number densities of neutral and ionized hydrogen atoms , is already significant , while the mass fraction of neutral hydrogen @xmath18 is still much greater than @xmath19 , so that the universe is opaque to the ly@xmath3 photons",
    "moreover , the temperature of hydrogen gas in the period @xmath20 is higher than that of the cmb",
    ". therefore , in this epoch , the 21 cm emission given by the hyperfine structure of the ground state @xmath21 of neutral hydrogen would be significant .",
    "this motivates us to investigate in this paper the statistical properties of the redshifted 21 cm emission from the epoch @xmath14 .",
    "many calculations on the redshifted 21 cm radiation from the early universe have been done based on various models of the thermal history around reionization ( ciardi & madau 2003 ; furlanetto & loeb 2002 , 2004 ; iliev et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; tozzi et al .",
    "2000 ; zaldarriaga et al . 2004",
    "; furlanetto et al .",
    "these works have generally focused on the power spectrum of the fluctuations of the 21 cm emission . in this paper , besides the power spectrum , we address the higher order statistics and non - gaussianity of the spatial distribution of the 21 cm emission . since the 21 cm emission at high redshifts is relevant to the earliest gravitational clustering and star formation of the universe , the field of the 21 cm emission must be non - gaussian .",
    "it would probably be the earliest non - gaussian field if the initial perturbations of cosmic mass density field are gaussian .",
    "the non - gaussianity of 21 cm emission field is not only theoretically important but also observationally useful .",
    "radio observation would be able to detect the cosmic 21 cm emissions if its flux is of the order of @xmath22 mjy or higher and angular scale is of the order of arcminutes ( morales and hewitt 2004 ; pen et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , it is a challenge to identify the redshifted 21 cm emission from the recombination epoch , since the noise from the artificial radio interference in the vhf band is serious .",
    "the non - gaussian statistical features would be helpful to draw the information from the noisy observations .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows .",
    " 2 briefly describes the basic results of the reionization and thermal history of hydrogen clouds in the ln model .  3",
    "presents the simulations of the baryon field and the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the epoch of @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the basic properties of the 21 cm emission from diffused intergalactic medium ( igm ) and collapsed halos are also addressed . ",
    "4 presents a statistical analysis of the @xmath5 fields , including the first- , second- and high - order statistics . finally ",
    "5 gives the discussion and conclusion .",
    "the ln model assumes that the mass density distribution @xmath23 of hydrogen gas at redshift @xmath24 is given by an exponential mapping of the linear distribution of the dark matter mass density contrast @xmath25 , which is smoothed on the jeans length scale of the gas at the redshift @xmath24 ( bi 1993 ) , i.e. , @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the mean density and @xmath28 is the variance of the gaussian mass field @xmath25 on the scale of the jeans length of the gas .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field @xmath29 is , then , lognormal : @xmath30 , \\hspace{3 mm } \\rho \\geq 0.\\ ] ] the dynamical arguments of the exponential mapping and ln pdf of both the dark matter and hydrogen clouds have been studied by , e.g. , coles & jones ( 1991 ) , jones ( 1999 ) , and szapudi & kaiser ( 2003 ) .",
    "the first characteristic of the ln model is that the clustering of hydrogen clouds is mainly dependent on the variance @xmath31 of the linear fluctuations on the scale of the jeans length , while the clustering of dark matter basically is independent of the properties of gas .",
    "therefore , the ln model is effective in describing the effect of the thermal status of hydrogen gas on the density and velocity field of the baryonic gas .",
    "this has been shown in the successful application of modelling igm ly@xmath3 forests of qso s absorption spectra in redshift range @xmath32 ( bi 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ; feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "the second characteristic is that , compared to a gaussian or a normal distribution , the pdf of an ln model described by equation ( 2 ) has a prolonged tail at the high - density end and that the probability of high - density events @xmath33 is very sensitive to @xmath31 .",
    "this property has already been found to be useful in explaining the intermittence of the transmitted flux of qso s ly@xmath3 absorption spectrum ( jamkhedkar et al . 2000 , 2003 ; pando et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the long tail can directly be seen with ( 1 ) the cumulative mass fraction @xmath34 , which is the fraction of mass in regions having mass density larger than a given @xmath35 , and ( 2 ) the volume filling factor @xmath36 , which is the fraction of volume with density larger than a given @xmath35 .",
    "they are @xmath37 = \\int ^{\\infty}_{\\rho/\\bar{\\rho } } x p(x ) dx = \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm erfc } \\left ( \\frac{\\ln ( \\rho/\\bar{\\rho})}{\\sqrt{2 } \\sigma_0}- \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right ) , \\ ] ] @xmath38 therefore , even when @xmath39 , the mass fraction of high - density events is already significant and their volume filling factor is very small .      in the context of the ln model",
    ", the evolution of hydrogen clouds is mainly dependent on the jeans length of hydrogen gas .",
    "if hydrogen gas is uniformly distributed , its jeans length is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sound speed of the gas .",
    "for cosmological study , it is convenient to use a comoving scale @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath43 is the mean temperature , @xmath44 the molecular weight of the gas , @xmath45 is the cosmological density parameter of total mass , and @xmath46 is the ratio of specific heat .",
    "primordial baryons , created at the time of nucleosynthesis , recombine with electrons to become neutral gas at @xmath47 . before @xmath48 , the residual ionization of the cosmic gas keeps its temperature locked to the cmb temperature ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "after @xmath48 , the gas cools down adiabatically because of the expansion of the universe . assuming the adiabatic index @xmath49 , i.e. , hydrogen temperature @xmath50 , the comoving jeans length evolves as @xmath51 kpc . during reionization ,",
    "the gas is heated by uv ionizing photons from a low temperature to @xmath52k .",
    "this leads to the increase of @xmath53 at @xmath0 .    assuming @xmath54 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al .",
    "2004 ) , the evolution of the jeans length is sketched in figure 1 , which gives the relation between @xmath53 and the cosmic scale factor @xmath55 .",
    "the sudden increase of @xmath53 at @xmath0 shown in figure 1 is certainly unrealistic , which comes from the assumption that the gas temperature increases instantly by a factor of about @xmath56 at @xmath0 .",
    "more realistically , the sharp changes of @xmath53 at @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be replaced by a softened transition . nevertheless , the physical status of the gas before and after @xmath0 is properly sketched in figure 1 .",
    "corresponding to the evolution of @xmath53 at @xmath0 , the variance @xmath31 , which is the @xmath57 mass fluctuation on the jeans length @xmath58 , also undergoes a zigzag evolution around @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath31 versus @xmath55 calculated with the @xmath53 of figure 1 . to calculate @xmath31 ,",
    "the power spectrum @xmath59 of the linear mass density perturbations is taken to be the spectrum of the low - density flat cold dark matter model ( lcdm ) , which is specified by the density parameter @xmath60 , the cosmological constant @xmath61 , and the hubble constant @xmath62 .",
    "the linear power spectrum @xmath59 is given by the fitting formula given by eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath31 with @xmath55 shown in figure 2 is due to the gravitational linear growth .",
    "the variance at small redshifts @xmath63 shown in figure 2 actually is the same as that given by bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the zigzagged feature at @xmath64 of figure 2 is due to heii reionization ( theuns et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "an important feature of @xmath31 shown in figure 2 is that the curve of @xmath31 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 almost repeats that from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the evolution of the fraction of mass [ eq.(3 ) ] in the period from @xmath65 to @xmath66 is similar to that from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the period from @xmath67 to @xmath68 corresponds to an evolution of weak - to - strong clustering of the baryonic gas , and the period from @xmath65 to @xmath66 also corresponds to an evolution of weak - to - strong clustering of baryonic gas .",
    "therefore , the formation rate of collapsed hydrogen clouds at @xmath65 is significantly lower than that at @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to a suppression of clustering and star formation just after @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamical picture of the suppression of clustering can be explained by the following negative feedback mechanism . during the reionization @xmath0",
    ", hydrogen clouds are heated by the ionizing photons so that the mean temperature of hydrogen clouds increases by a few orders .",
    "all the irregularities originally formed in cold gas on scales smaller than the new jeans length would be smoothed out by the heated gas , and the variance of the fluctuations of hydrogen cloud distribution drops back below unity .",
    "although dark matter halos continuously collapse before and after @xmath0 , hydrogen clouds on scales less than the new jeans length will stop collapsing . as a result , star formation will be slowed down or may be even halted in these halos after @xmath0 .",
    "the level of the star formation suppression is adjusted by the following mechanism .",
    "once the star formation rate declines , the uv background produced by the star formation also becomes lower , and so do the temperature and entropy states of hydrogen gas , which make it easy for further star formation . on the contrary , if the star formation rate increases , the uv background produced by the star formation also increases , and then more hydrogen gas will be heated to higher temperature and higher entropy states .",
    "this finally yields more suppression in the rate of star formation .",
    "when the variance @xmath31 grows again to unity around @xmath66 because of the increase of the potential wells of dark matter , there is once again enough to have collapsed hydrogen clouds , star formation , and ionizing photons .",
    "this finally gives rise to the gunn - peterson transparency .",
    "therefore , the long - lasting period from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is due to the zigzag of @xmath31 around reionization @xmath0 .",
    "the difference @xmath69 is found to be equal to @xmath70 .",
    "it is weakly dependent on , or stable with respect to , the following parameters : ( 1 ) the threshold of the collapsed hydrogen clouds @xmath71 and ( 2 ) the mean ionizing photons released by each baryon in the collapsed objects ( liu et al .",
    "this stability is due to the above - mentioned adjustment mechanism . in this sense",
    ", the redshift of reionization @xmath72 actually is determined by the redshift of the gunn - peterson transparency @xmath1 ( liu et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this result is also in good agreement with the observed optical depth @xmath73 to the cmb photons .      according to the above - discussed scenario , in the epoch @xmath10",
    ", hydrogen gas is cold and neutral .",
    "it may contain some individual ionized spheres around the first - generation stars .",
    "hydrogen clouds generally are opaque to ly@xmath3 photons .",
    "when @xmath24 approaches @xmath0 , the increasing individual ionized regions overlap . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the individual ionized regions fully overlap in the sense that the universe becomes transparent to soft x - ray photons .",
    "thus , after @xmath0 , hydrogen clouds are heated by soft x - ray photons and the star formation is suppressed .",
    "the fraction of ionized hydrogen ( @xmath75 ) will no longer increase , or will even decrease after @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , hydrogen clouds are still opaque to ly@xmath3 photons .",
    "it has been shown that if the photoionization heating is the major heating process of the hydrogen clouds , the mean gas temperature is always of the order of @xmath76 k , weakly dependent on the intensity of heating photons ( black 1981 ; ostriker & ikeuchi 1983 ) .",
    "this result is further supported by hydrodynamic simulations of baryonic gas in the early universe ( e.g. , hui & haiman 2003 ) .",
    "they showed that the mean gas temperature asymptotically approaches @xmath77 k. this temperature is not determined by the intensity of the heating photons , but is completely given by the shape ( or hardness ) of the spectrum of the heating photons . the mean temperature is higher for harder photon spectra , such as soft x - rays .",
    "thus , although star formation is slowing down after @xmath0 , the mean temperature will still be in the range @xmath77 k. therefore , it is reasonable to assume that in the epoch of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the mean gas temperature can be described as @xmath78^{\\eta}$ ] , where @xmath79k and the index @xmath80 is of the order of 1 . in figure 3 , we plot the mean temperature evolution for the two cases of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we also show , respectively , the temperature effect on the jeans length @xmath53 and variance @xmath31 in the epoch @xmath20 .    if hydrogen gas is polytropic , gas temperature at the point with mass density @xmath35 is given by @xmath83 . in this way",
    ", we can calculate the thermal status of hydrogen from the density distribution . in the ln model , the relation @xmath84 and the index @xmath46",
    "actually are given by fitting the hydrodynamical simulation ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "in this case , shock heating is partially considered . however ,",
    "if gravitational shocks are strong , the temperature of hydrogen gas is basically multiphased , and one can not describe the @xmath84 relation by a single equation . to estimate the effect of strong shock , we have to replace the temperature - density relation @xmath83 with @xmath85 , the pdf of temperature at a given @xmath35 .",
    "such a pdf has been recently derived by using a hydrodynamic simulation code that is very effective in capturing shocks ( he et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that strong shock events are very rare at @xmath86 , i.e. , that the events leading to the deviation from the relation @xmath83 are negligible at @xmath87 .",
    "we produce simulation samples of spatial distribution of hydrogen gas @xmath29 by the ln model . in order to quickly grasp the features of these distributions ,",
    "we only concentrate on samples of one - dimensional distribution .",
    "the details of the simulation procedures have been given in bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) and bi et al .",
    "a brief description is as follows .",
    "we first generate the one - dimensional density and velocity distributions in fourier space , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are two gaussian random fields .",
    "both @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given by the power spectrum , @xmath92 as follows ( bi 1993 ; bi et al . 1995 ) @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the linear growth factors for the @xmath97 and @xmath98 fields at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath99 and @xmath100 fields are gaussian with the power spectra given by @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath92 is the power spectrum of the three - dimensional field @xmath103 .",
    "the functions @xmath104 in equation ( 7 ) is defined by @xmath105 the power spectrum @xmath92 is taken to be ( bi & davidsen 1997 ; bi et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath106 obviously , @xmath107 is also a function of @xmath24 via the redshift dependence of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath109 and @xmath53 , one can produce the distributions @xmath90 at the grid points @xmath110 , @xmath111 in one - dimensional fourier space .",
    "the spatial distributions @xmath112 can be obtained by using the fast fourier transform .",
    "since the velocity follows the linear evolution longer than the density , we can use the linear @xmath89 and its fourier counterpart as good approximations of the velocity field at high redshifts . in figure 4",
    "we plot a typical realization of the gas mass density fields at redshifts 7 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "the simulation size shown in figure 4 is 50 @xmath113 mpc in comoving space .",
    "the total number of pixels is @xmath114 .",
    "the pixel size is then @xmath115 kpc , which is less than the smallest scale of @xmath53 at @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the samples are qualified for studying the non - gaussian features of the hydrogen clouds on small scales .    as analyzed in  2.3 ,",
    "the effect of strong gravitational shock at high redshifts is negligible and the temperature of hydrogen gas can be calculated by the relation @xmath117 .",
    "we then have the temperature field of the hydrogen clouds . with the mass density and temperature fields",
    ", one can find the neutral hydrogen mass density fields with the photoionization equilibrium equation as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the recombination rate , @xmath120 is the collisional ionization rate , @xmath121 is the number density of electrons , and @xmath122 the rate of photoionization of hydrogen ( black 1981 ) .",
    "although equation ( 11 ) is reasonable for determining @xmath123 of the igm at @xmath12 , there are two points should be addressed when applying it to the epoch @xmath124 .",
    "first , equation ( 11 ) is applicable only if the hydrogen clouds are optically thin for photons of @xmath122 .",
    "however , hydrogen clouds of @xmath125 are optically thick for ly@xmath3 photons and may also be so for photons of @xmath126 ev .",
    "therefore , in our case , the flux @xmath122 in equation ( 11 ) is not for ly@xmath3 , but for soft x - ray photons . as discussed in  2.3 , in the epoch @xmath127 , hydrogen clouds are transparent to soft x - ray photons , which are the major sources of photoionization heating .",
    "this picture is consistent with the fact that the photon spectra from the first - generation ( massive ) stars are generally hard .",
    "second , in the case of @xmath12 , the parameter @xmath122 is determined by fitting it with the mean transmitted flux of ly@xmath3 photons ( e.g. , choudhury et al .",
    "obviously , no such observations can be used to constrain the parameter @xmath122 in the epoch of @xmath128 .",
    "however , @xmath129 can be adjusted by fitting it to the mean fractions of @xmath130 or @xmath75 , which are required by the optical depth @xmath73 . using this method",
    ", we can produce samples of @xmath123 field .",
    "both the models of @xmath131=@xmath132 and @xmath133 are consistent with the optical depth @xmath73 from the wmap .      with the sample of gas mass density , temperature , and @xmath123 distributions",
    ", we can calculate the 21 cm ( @xmath134 1420 mhz ) emission of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "this emission at redshift @xmath24 is determined by the difference between the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen , @xmath135 , and the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , @xmath136 k. there are two mechanisms leading to @xmath137 , collision and radiation background , which gives ( field 1958 , 1959 ) @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the temperature of hydrogen gas , @xmath140 is the temperature of ly@xmath3 photons , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the collision and radiative excitation efficiencies , respectively . since hydrogen clouds are optically thick to the ly@xmath3 photons , it is reasonable to assume that ly@xmath3 photons are in approximate thermal equilibrium with the gas .",
    "thus , one can take @xmath140 to be the gas temperature .",
    "considering self - absorption , the brightness temperature of the 21 cm radiation at redshift @xmath24 is determined from the radiation transfer equation as @xmath143 where the first term on the right - hand side is from the cmb and the second term is from neutral hydrogen ; @xmath144 is the optical depth of the 21 cm absorption .",
    "when @xmath145 is much larger than @xmath146 k , @xmath144 is given by ( wild 1952 ) @xmath147 where factor @xmath148 is the normalized line profile .",
    "for doppler broadening , we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 . for gas with temperature",
    "@xmath151 k , we have @xmath152 , and therefore the integral of equation ( 14 ) lasts for a very narrow range @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the velocity distortion can be ignored in the first stage .",
    "if @xmath155 and @xmath135 are not strong functions of @xmath24 , equation ( 14 ) gives approximately ( field 1959 ) @xmath156 therefore the fields @xmath155 and @xmath135 in equation ( 16 ) are , respectively , the hi number density and spin temperature @xmath135 smoothed by the window function equation ( 15 ) .",
    "thus , equation ( 13 ) yields approximately @xmath157 , and therefore the observed brightness temperature excess at the redshifted frequency @xmath158 is @xmath159\\frac{1-e^{-\\tau(z)}}{1+z}.\\ ] ]    we show in figure 5 a typical realization of the fields of @xmath160 , @xmath144 , and @xmath5 at @xmath24=7 in the temperature model @xmath161 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the field of the brightness temperature excess , @xmath5 , is highly nonuniform . at most places",
    ", @xmath5 is actually zero but contains many high spikes , or patchy structures .",
    "the average of @xmath5 is only @xmath162 , while the spikes can be as high as 20 - 40 mk .",
    "the rms of the brightness temperature fluctuations , @xmath163 , is @xmath164 7 mk . for @xmath165",
    ", we have @xmath166 mk .",
    "it has been argued that the brightness temperature excess would be too small to observe when considering the foreground noise contamination .",
    "however , the nontrivial features of the non - gaussianity might help identify the redshifted 21 cm emission from the contaminated data .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the @xmath5 field can also be seen with @xmath167 , which is the fraction of @xmath168 given by regions with hydrogen gas density from @xmath35 to @xmath35+@xmath169 .",
    "figure 6 plots the integrated fraction function @xmath170 .",
    "it shows that about one - third of @xmath168 is given by regions with density @xmath171 and that the other two - thirds are from regions of @xmath172 . because the @xmath172 regions correspond to the collapsed / collapsing hydrogen clouds ( bi et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al .",
    "2004 ) , figure 6 shows that both diffused and collapsed hydrogen clouds of the mass field have comparable contributions to the brightness temperature fluctuations of the redshifted 21 cm emission .",
    "therefore , the non - gaussianity caused by the quasi - linear and the nonlinear clustering of hydrogen clouds should be significant .",
    "in order to effectively describe statistical features of @xmath4 field , we decompose the @xmath5 field by the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ; fang & feng 2000 ; fang & thews 1998 ) . because the dwt modes are spatially localized , each dimension can be treated separately , and hence it is easy to match the simulation with the physical condition of the sampling .",
    "the three - dimensional power spectrum can be effectively recovered by dwt from the data in an area with  poor \" geometry .",
    "therefore , with the dwt , one can effectively compare and test the predicted statistical properties from one - dimensional or two - dimensional simulation with various observations ( e.g. , guo et al . 2004 and references therein ) .    in the dwt scheme ,",

    "the power law tail shows a slightly smoothing scale dependence .",
    "we plot in figure 8 the pdfs of the wfcs , in which @xmath197 is replaced by @xmath212 since the latter has the dimension of temperature .",
    "the parameters used in figure 8 are the same as those in figure 7 .",
    "the pdfs shown in figure 8 are also weakly dependent on the temperature parameters , but the tails of the pdfs are more significantly dependent on scale @xmath191 than in figure 7 . if we describe the tail by a power law @xmath213 , the index @xmath214 is bigger with larger scales . in other words ,",
    "the tails are longer for smaller scales .",
    "this leads to the mean power @xmath215 being lower for higher @xmath191 ( see next subsection on power spectrum ) .    in either figures 7 or 8 ,",
    "the mean of @xmath216 or @xmath202 is given by the events corresponding to the long tail of the pdfs .",
    "that is , the maps of @xmath5 or @xmath202 are very different from the gaussian noise field .",
    "the two - mode correlation of the sfcs @xmath217 is similar to the ordinary two - point correlation function .",

    "the two - mode correlation functions are typically of power law @xmath222 in the range @xmath223 @xmath113 mpc with index @xmath224 .",
    "the central part of the correlation function , or @xmath225 @xmath113 mpc , is flat because of the jeans length smoothing .",
    "the tail , or @xmath226 h@xmath221 mpc , of the correlation function approaches @xmath227 , which is the mean of @xmath5 .",
    "the two - mode correlation function of the wfcs @xmath228 , or @xmath229 , generally is diagonal with respect to @xmath230 , especially if the initial mass perturbation is gaussian ( feng & fang 2004 ; guo et al .",
    "thus we have in general @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the dwt power spectrum of the one - dimensional field , of which the relation with the fourier power spectrum @xmath59 has been given in fang & feng ( 2000 ) .",
    "figure 10 gives the power spectrum @xmath233 for parameters @xmath234 k , 2 , 7 ) and @xmath235 k , 2 , 10 ) .",
    "the power spectra of these two cases are similar . however , if using angular scales , they are different .",
    "for instance , although both spectra are peaked at @xmath236 , they correspond to angular scale 0@xmath206.22 at @xmath237 , or 0@xmath206.20 at @xmath238 .",
    "the power @xmath239 increases from @xmath240 ( comoving scale 12.5 @xmath113 mpc ) to @xmath236 ( 0.39 @xmath113 mpc ) .",

    "the power @xmath241 gradually decreases with @xmath191 when @xmath242 ( comoving scale less than 0.39 @xmath113 mpc ) , this is because of the jeans smoothing of hydrogen gas .",
    "high - order moments are sensitive to non - gaussianity .",
    "we use two standard high - order moment statistics : ( 1 ) @xmath243 and ( 2 ) @xmath244 .",
    "if the @xmath5 field is gaussian , the high - order moment of @xmath5 satisfies the relation @xmath245^{1/n}.\\ ] ] on the other hand , if the @xmath5 field is lognormal , we have @xmath246,\\ ] ] where @xmath247 is the variance of @xmath248 .",
    "we plot in figure 11 the high - order moments @xmath243 and @xmath249 for the parameters @xmath250 and @xmath251 . as a comparison",
    ", we also plot the corresponding gaussian and ln moments in figures 11a and 11b , respectively .",
    "figure 11 shows that the @xmath5 field is neither gaussian nor lognormal .",
    "the high - order moments are always significantly higher than a gaussian field for @xmath252 , but always less than an ln field . in both temperature models ,",
    "the two high - order moments are always quickly increasing with @xmath6 when @xmath253 , and then slowly increasing when @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , the non - gaussianity of the @xmath5 field is less than the mass density field of hydrogen clouds .",
    "this is because high - density areas correspond to lower @xmath123 regions .",
    "the non - gaussianity is weakened when transferring the mass field to the @xmath123 field by equation ( 11 ) .",
    "moreover , equation ( 12 ) leads to further weakening of the non - gaussianity given by high - density peaks . therefore , although its pdfs ( fig . 7 )",
    "are long tailed , the non - gaussianity of the @xmath5 field is not as strong as that of an ln field .",
    "high - order moments are more sensitive to the tails of @xmath5 pdfs , and therefore , the statistics @xmath243 and @xmath249 are less dependent on the lower limit of observable @xmath5 . if we use only the observable events with @xmath255 mk , the high - order moments given by the truncated pdfs [ fig .",
    "7 ] will not be changed very much . moreover ,",
    "the statistics @xmath243 and @xmath249 are defined by ratios of @xmath5 .",

    "2000 ; feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "figure 12 presents the @xmath265 versus @xmath191 of the @xmath4 field with parameters @xmath266 and @xmath205 and @xmath267 , 4 and 8 .",
    "figure 12 shows once again that the statistical results are less dependent on the temperature parameters considered . for all cases of @xmath267 , 4 and 8 , the @xmath5 fields are substantially scale - scale correlated on scales @xmath268 , corresponding to length scale 6.25 @xmath113 mpc and angular scale 3@xmath206.52 at @xmath237 or 3@xmath206.28 at @xmath238 . at scale @xmath269 , or 0.20 @xmath113mpc ,",
    "@xmath261 is as large as @xmath270 , which would be very useful for distinguishing the signal of @xmath271 from noise .    from figure 12",
    "we see that the scale - scale correlation is remarkably increasing from @xmath267 to @xmath272 , but not so from @xmath272 to @xmath273 .",
    "this is again because the pdfs of @xmath5 are long tailed , but not very long .",
    "this can strongly affect statistics of order @xmath253 , but not @xmath274 .",
    "we calculate also the scale - scale correlation for noise - contaminated samples .",
    "it indeed shows that the gaussian noise can be filtered out with the scale - scale correlations .",
    "we have studied the brightness temperature excess @xmath5 of the redshifted 21 cm emission of hydrogen clouds in the epoch@xmath275 . according to the ln model",
    ", the mean temperature of hydrogen clouds does not undergo strong evolution and is generally @xmath79 k. therefore , the 21 cm emission from this epoch possesses some statistical features weakly dependent on the details of this epoch .",
    "they are as follows :                to obtain the above results , we used the fraction of neutral hydrogen @xmath130 given by the ln model ( liu et al .",
    "2004 ) . actually , the evolution of the @xmath130 fraction in @xmath280 is not strongly constrained by the current observations .",
    "the optical depth @xmath73 is sensitive to @xmath0 and the mean of the @xmath130 fraction in @xmath280 , but not to the details of the evolution of the @xmath130 fraction .",
    "different evolution models of the @xmath130 and @xmath75 fractions can reasonably explain the observed @xmath73 .",
    "however , among the above results , the last two points ( high - order moments and scale - scale correlations ) are based on statistics given by the ratios of @xmath5 .",
    "they are probably less dependent on the @xmath130 or @xmath75 fractions .",
    "we show that the non - gaussian properties of the @xmath5 field comes from the non - gaussianity of the mass field at high redshifts . for a given redshift @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath5 field of the redshifted 21 cm emission is dependent only on @xmath43 at that redshift , but less sensitive to the details of the redshift evolution of @xmath43 . on the other hand , in the epoch @xmath281",
