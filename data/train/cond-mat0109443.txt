    "the one dimensional domany - kinzel cellular automaton ( dkca ) is a totally discrete systems - temporally , spatially and in numbers of states - with several applications in physics , chemistry , biology , computer science , etc .",
    "the dkca phase diagram was originally proposed by domany and kinzel @xcite who showed the existence of two phases : an active phase and a frozen one . a more detailed study , using numerical simulation , was present by martins _ et al _ @xcite , where a new phase in the active region - a chaotic phase - was discovered using the damage spreading technique .",
    "further , zebende and penna @xcite used the gradient method to determine the phase boundaries with high precision .",
    "recently , tom @xcite explored some details of the joint evolution of two dkca .",
    "she considered the problem of simultaneous updating of two replicas using pseudo - random numbers ; two prescriptions were presented for the joint evolution : one used by martins _",
    "et al _ @xcite and another introduced by kohring and schereckenberg @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite discovered a third phase in the dkca diagram , using a thorough analysis of the damage spreading technique to split the active phase into three different regions : a chaotic region , where the damage spreads for every member of this family of dynamic procedures ; an active region , where the damage heals for every member of this family , and another active region , where the damage spreads for a subset of the possible dynamic procedures and heals for the others .",
    "this new phase was obtained with a prescription that updates the replicas using the minimal correlations .    in 1997 ,",
    "de sales _ et al _ @xcite showed that the roughness exponent @xmath6 can be used to classify the deterministic cellular automata ( ca ) described by wolfram @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , they showed that this exponent also can be used to detect the frozen / active transition in dkca directly from the automata , without reference to order parameters or response functions .",
    "this method also can be used to detect phase transitions in another kinds of models , such as the potts model @xcite . beyond the roughness exponent @xmath6",
    ", the growth exponent @xmath0 is another critical exponent used to describe various roughening processes in the surface growth context @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce the growth exponent method to identify phase transitions .",
    "we apply this method to the one dimensional dkca to detect the phase transitions directly from the automata and build the dkca phase diagram . to obtain self - affine rough profiles",
    ", we use the accumulation method to perform a mapping to the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model , and measure the time evolution of the roughness of the interface to obtain the exponent @xmath0 . in the frozen / active transition , the exponent @xmath0 has a maximum , and two schemes are used to update the system @xcite : a symmetric scheme , that corresponds to a triangular lattice , and a nonsymmetric scheme . in the symmetric scheme we obtain @xmath4 , consistent with the directed percolation ( dp ) prediction ; but in the nonsymmetric scheme , @xmath5 , an unusual value that was not expected .",
    "it is expected @xcite , rather , to find the same value for @xmath0 in the two schemes .",
    "very recently , a quite similar method was used by lauritsen and alava @xcite , to study the edwards - wilkinson equation with columnar noise , and by dickman @xcite , to study the contact process .",
    "this studies do not consider damage spreading , and can not detect the chaotic / non - chaotic transition . to evidence this transition ,",
    "we use the damage spreading ideas @xcite : the difference between two replicas , which evolve with same dynamics , is used to perform the same sos mapping as mentioned above , via the accumulation method .",
    "we use three different prescriptions for the simultaneous updating of the replicas and obtain three different transition lines .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the growth exponent method and show the results obtained for the frozen / active transition . the damage spreading ideas and the chaotic / non - chaotic transition are presented in the section iii .",
    "finally , we let to the section iv our conclusions and acknowledgements .",
    "the dkca consists of a linear chain of @xmath7 sites ( @xmath8 ) , with periodic boundary conditions , where each site has two possible states @xmath9 ( frozen , active ) .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath2 is given by the set \\{@xmath10}. in contrast to the deterministic ca studied by wolfram @xcite , the dkca is probabilistic , in the sense that the rules that update the system are given by conditional probabilities , @xmath11 ( in the symmetric scheme ) .",
    "that is , the state of given site in time ( @xmath12 ) depends in a probabilistic fashion upon the state of the two nearest neighbours at time @xmath2 . in the dkca , the conditional probabilities in the isotropic case are @xmath13 obviously , @xmath14 in the nonsymmetric scheme , the conditional probabilities are given by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the values of the conditional probabilities are the same in both schemes . in figure 1",
    "we reproduce a representation of these schemes .    depending on the values of the parameters ( @xmath17 )",
    ", the asymptotic ( @xmath18 ) state of the system is either a _ frozen _ state , with all sites in state 0 , or has a finite fraction of sites with value 1 , the _ active _ state .",
    "this is a second order phase transition , characterized by universal critical exponents @xcite .",
    "to study the phase diagram of the dkca , we use the accumulation method , introduced by sales _",
    "@xcite , to obtain profiles in analogy with solid - on - solid ( sos ) models in ( @xmath19 ) dimensions .",
    "this method consists in accumulating ( or summing ) all the values assumed by the variables @xmath20 during a given number @xmath2 of successive time steps [ soma ] h_i(t ) = ^t_=0 _ i ( )  .",
    "the differences between the schemes become explicit at this point . in the figure 2",
    ", we can observe several profiles at criticality in both schemes , generated after we apply the accumulation method .",
    "it is evident that different schemes lead to completely different profiles .",
    "thus , we obtain growth processes , the nature of whose correlations can be investigated through the analysis of the roughness @xmath21 @xcite",
    ". the roughness is defined by [ rugos ] w^2(l , t ) = ^l_i=1 ( h_i(t ) - ( t ) ) ^2  ,    where @xmath22 is the mean value of @xmath23 at time @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , in order to consider the initial roughness of the profiles , we work with the fluctuation in roughness @xcite [ dw ] w ( l , t ) =  . we expect that the behavior of @xmath24 has the form [ scal ] w(l , t ) ~l^ f ( )  ,    where @xmath25 is a universal scaling function , @xmath6 is the roughness exponent , @xmath26 is the dynamic exponent and @xmath0 is the growth exponent .",
    "the function @xmath27 at large times ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 at short times ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "so , at short times , we expect that @xmath31 and can measure @xmath0 calculating the slope of the @xmath32 plot of @xmath24 versus @xmath2 .",
    "the growth exponent denotes how the profile roughness grows with time : @xmath33 means that the profile is not correlated , and is analogous to that generated by random deposition @xcite ; if @xmath34 , the profile tends to grow more at the tips , which causes the roughness increases faster , in contrast to @xmath35 , where the valleys grows quickly and make the roughness increase more slowly .",
    "typical results for the evolution of the roughness are showed in figure 3 .",
    "these results correspond to averages over 50 random initial configurations taken after @xmath36 time steps in dkca containing @xmath37 sites .",
    "each curve in this graph ( 101 points ) takes approximately one hour of cpu time on a digital @xmath38 workstation .",
    "we can observe that the roughness reaches the steady state in the frozen phase and grows indefinitely in the active phase .",
    "the values of @xmath0 at the transition are showed in figure 4 , for both schemes .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is measured over more than three decades ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that @xmath0 shows a maximum at the transition and tends to the value @xmath41 quickly after the transition , remaining at this value until @xmath42 .",
    "the value of the @xmath0 exponent at the transition depends of the scheme utilized in the dkca .",
    "et al _ describe two schemes : a symmetric one , where the even ( odd ) sites are updated at even ( odd ) times ; and a nonsymmetric one , where all sites are updated at each time step , but the neighbours of site @xmath43 are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the symmetric scheme has been used in most previos studies of the model . in the symmetric scheme ,",
    "we find @xmath46 , compatible with the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "in the nonsymmetric scheme , we find @xmath48 , clealy different from the dp value .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis was made for the exponent @xmath0 and shows that the width of the peak vanishes when the size of system goes to infinity .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath0 when the system size goes to infinity approaches @xmath49 at the frozen / active transition in the symmetric scheme , and is valid for all values of @xmath50 .    on the line @xmath51",
    ", the system is mapped in the two - dimensional ising model @xcite , and the @xmath0 value is significant greater in the two schemes : @xmath52 in the symmetric , and @xmath53 in the nonsymmetric .",
    "the value in the symmetric scheme agrees with the literature @xcite , which predicts that at all points on phase boundary , except the line @xmath54 , are characterized by directed percolation ( dp ) exponents . on the line @xmath54 ,",
    "the model has been solved exactly , and can be mapped in the bi - dimensional ising model universality class , which leads to the value @xmath55 @xcite .    the value @xmath56 denotes the trend of the system to grow faster at the tips which can be understood as a preservation of active sites . at the transition ,",
    "few sites remain active , which causes @xmath23 to grow only near active sites , contributing to an increase in the roughness . in the active phase , many sites are active , but uncorrelated , randomly increasing the height @xmath23 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "the roughness exponent is defined only in the frozen phase because , in the active phase , the steady state is not reached .",
    "we calculate the hurst exponent , @xmath57 , very close to the transition and find , in the symmetric scheme , @xmath58 . as noted by de sales _",
    "et al _ @xcite , there is a maximum in the @xmath57 exponent , marking the phase transition . in the nonsymmetric scheme ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 at the transition is much smaller , @xmath59 , and the maximum is not very clear .",
    "martins _ et al _ @xcite used the damage spreading technique to show that the active phase of dkca can be split into two phases , chaotic and non - chaotic .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the difference between two replicas with slightly different initial configurations .",
    "they let the system evolve until it attains equilibrium , and then a replica of the automaton is created with some sites altered ( damage ) .",
    "so the two replicas , one with states @xmath20 the another with states @xmath60 , evolve with the same dynamics , and the difference between the automata @xmath61 is measured .",
    "the fraction of sites in replica system that differ from their counterpart in the original system is called the hamming distance , defined as @xmath62 the stationary hamming distance is null in the non - chaotic phase and positive in the chaotic phase .    to obtain the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary , we use a slightly different method , where the difference between the two automata is used to perform the same mapping to a sos model as we did in the accumulation method [ acc2 ] h_i(t ) = ^t_=0 _ i ( )  .",
    "thus , the profile generated by the difference of the two replicas behaves exactly as the profiles generated in the frozen / active boundary : the roughness reaches a stationary value in the non - chaotic phase and grows indefinitely in the chaotic phase .",
    "this behavior can be understood if we note that the difference between the replicas vanishes in the non - chaotic phase , which implies no contribution to the height @xmath23 , and is positive in chaotic phase , which implies in a persistent contribution to the height .",
    "the @xmath0 exponent again passes through a maximum at the chaotic / non - chaotic transition , and its value depends on the scheme utilized .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath0 for the chaotic / non - chaotic transitions , in the symmetric scheme . to obtain this figure",
    ", we use an automaton with @xmath63 and let it evolve for @xmath64 time steps , at which time we create a replica of the system with an `` initial damage '' , by flipping a fraction of the sites ( @xmath65 ) . then the replicas evolve with the same dynamics during the @xmath66 time steps , and the difference between them is measured as a function of time . an average over @xmath67 realizations of initial damage",
    "was used .",
    "we can locate the chaotic / non - chaotic phase transition , with the damage method , either waiting or not waiting for the original system to reach the steady state ( first @xmath64 time steps ) .",
    "the only difference we note is that the value for the exponent @xmath0 , at the frozen / active transition , is more precise and the cusp is more pronounced if we wait the original to reach the steady state . for the chaotic / non - chaotic transition",
    "we obtain the same values with the two procedures , considering the statistical fluctuations .    at this point",
    "we have to emphasize the question of the dynamics of joint evolution of two ca s .",
    "tom @xcite studied this joint evolution and showed that the ca s can evolve following two different prescriptions : prescription a , used by martins _",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to updating both automata always using the same random number , and prescription b , introduced by kohring and schereckenberg @xcite , which implies that one must sometimes use two different random numbers ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) to update the original and the replica .",
    "the later occurs when we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 , or vice - versa .",
    "we make simulations using these two prescriptions and verify that there are significant differences in the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary of the dkca @xmath72 phase diagram , as showed in figure 6 .",
    "these differences were discovered by bagnoli @xcite , who studied the damage spreading transition in the dkca using a mean - field approximation ; this work confirms his prediction numerically . the frozen / active transition line and the chaotic / non - chaotic transition line obtained with prescription a are very close to the the phase diagram found by zebende and penna @xcite .    in this phase diagram we also present a third prescription , c , in which three random numbers , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath73 , are used to update the system . defining @xmath74 and @xmath75 we have the following cases : @xmath76 if @xmath77 we use the same random number ( @xmath68 ) to update the original and the replica ;",
    "@xmath76 if @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( or vice - versa ) @xmath80 we use @xmath68 for the original and @xmath69 for the replica ; @xmath76 if @xmath78 and @xmath81 ( or vice - versa ) @xmath80 we use @xmath68 for the original and @xmath73 for the replica .",
    "@xmath76 if @xmath82 and @xmath81 ( or vice - versa ) @xmath80 we use @xmath69 for the original and @xmath73 for the replica .",
    "to this prescription , the boundary is slighting above that of prescription b.    the difference between the phase boundaries appears to be due the different prescriptions for updating the systems in the damage spreading technique employed to detect the chaotic / non - chaotic transition : prescription a corresponds to maximal correlations between the random numbers ; prescription b , to lower correlations , and prescription c to minimal correlations @xcite .",
    "we perform simulations using the third prescription in an attempt to reveal the third phase transition , reported by hinrichsen _ et al _ @xcite , but are unable to detect that transition using prescription c , which is the prescription with minimal correlations .",
    "in this work we propose a new method to obtain the phase diagram of the dkca using the growth exponent @xmath0 , and detect the frozen / active boundary . at the transition ,",
    "the values of the exponent @xmath0 depend on the scheme used to update the system : @xmath83 for the symmetric scheme , and @xmath84 to the nonsymmetric scheme .",
    "next , we extend this method , using damage spreading , to obtain the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary . finally , we study three different prescriptions for the joint evolution of two dkca s and construct the phase diagram , showed in figure 6 .",
    "the advantage of this method to determine the phase diagram of the dkca is that we do not need to wait for the system to reach the steady state , as in the methods used by martins _",
    "et al _ @xcite and zebende and penna @xcite , thereby economizing computation time .",
    "in addition , the growth exponent method can detect the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary much more clearly than the usual hamming distance , which presents large fluctuations at the transition .",
    "this method can also be employed to detect phase transitions in other models where the accumulation process can be used @xcite .    *",
