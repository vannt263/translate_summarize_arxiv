    "shown in the fig  [ fig : scat ] is the effect of chirality on the dominant scattering angle , where the suppression of backscattering seen in graphene is absent for bilayer graphene .",
    "it was argued recently that the suppression of @xmath120 scattering in graphene implied weak temperature dependence  @xcite until higher temperatures where phonon effects are observed .",
    "the fact that @xmath120 scattering is not suppressed in bilayer graphene does not , however , necessarily lead to any screening ( or equivalently , friedel oscillation ) induced strong temperature dependence in the resistivity .",
    "the temperature dependence in bilayer graphene depends on three dimensionless parameters : @xmath121 ; @xmath122 ; and @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the dingle temperature and @xmath125 is the fermi temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence from screening will be weak if any one of these three parameters is not large .",
    "the actual value of the dimensionless screening parameter @xmath126 is reasonably small even at the lowest accessible carrier density set by @xmath127 , making the temperature dependence arising from screening rather weak .",
    "second , the dimensionless temperature @xmath128 is rather small since the fermi temperature @xmath125 changes from @xmath129 at low density ( set by @xmath8 ) to @xmath130 at high density ( set by @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is a geometry related factor ) .",
    "the fermi temperature is relatively high due to the very small carrier effective mass ( @xmath133 ) in bilayer graphene .",
    "in fact , the effective mass for bilayer graphene is less than half of that for 2d electrons in gaas ( @xmath134 ) , where the temperature dependence arising from screening is extremely small  @xcite even at much lower carrier densities",
    ". therefore , we do not anticipate any strong screening - induced temperature dependence in bilayer graphene resistivity . finally , the currently available bilayer graphene samples have very small mobilities resulting in relatively strong collisional broadening effects ( i.e. high dingle temperature ) which would suppress any small screening induced temperature dependence that could have arisen at low temperatures . in particular , a mobility of @xmath135 as observed in ref",
    ".   corresponds to a @xmath136 , leading to further suppression of any screening induced temperature dependence in the conductivity .",
    "it is therefore gratifying to see that the recent experiment on bilayer graphene  @xcite does not see much temperature dependence in the low temperature resistivity in spite of the importance of @xmath120 scattering in bilayer graphene .",
    "the temperature dependence seen in the plateau region is likely to be caused by thermal population of carriers since @xmath137 , and the temperature dependence is seen for @xmath138 . for @xmath139 , the thermally excited carrier density @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "this gives @xmath142 for bilayer graphene , while @xmath143 for graphene giving for the conductivity ( ignoring any phonon or electron - hole scattering contributions ) @xmath144 note that the thermal excitation of carriers leads to an enhanced  @xcite @xmath145 whereas temperature dependent @xmath146 screening typically suppresses @xmath145 .",
    "for bilayer graphene , this result suggests that for @xmath147 , there would be a @xmath148 percent enhancement in the minimum conductivity which is consistent with the observations and estimates of ref .  .",
    "the situation for single layer graphene is quite different , since even in the low density saturation regime , @xmath149 .",
    "for example , a residual density @xmath150 corresponds to @xmath151 for bilayer graphene and @xmath152 for single layer graphene . for this reason ,",
    "one expects the minimum conductivity in bilayer graphene to show stronger temperature dependence than single layer graphene even though eq .",
    "[ eq : temp ] shows the bilayer conductivity scaling as @xmath153 ( compared to @xmath154 for the monolayer ) .",
    "the formalism developed here captures many features of graphene bilayer transport . in particular , we show that both the low density saturation and the high - density linear in density behavior seen in recent experiments arise from the same charged impurities that are invariably present in samples exfoliated onto a sio@xmath6 substrate .",
    "we note that the agreement between our self - consistent boltzmann theory and available graphene ( and bilayer ) transport experiments and direct measurement of the electron and hole puddles giving rise to the residual density , indicate that in current experiments , most of the charged impurities reside close to the graphene - substrate interface ( i.e. within @xmath155 ) similar to the corresponding situation in si - sio@xmath6 mosfet structures .",
    "if the typical distance of impurities from the graphene ( or bilayer ) sheet could be changed in future experiments ( e.g. by removing the sio@xmath6 substrate ) , the formalism we have developed predicts quantitatively its effect on transport properties and on the magnitude of the electron and hole puddles .",
    "another conclusion of our work is that bilayer mobilities are an order of magnitude smaller than corresponding mobilities for graphene samples on similar substrates .",
    "we also argue that the minimum conductivity , plateau width and threshold voltage have different scaling in graphene and bilayers and have different dependence on the substrate dielectric constant .",
    "these differences could potentially be useful when designing a particular device application .",
    "moreover , a systematic study of the differences in transport properties between single layer graphene and bilayer graphene could verify our claim that the underlying mechanism for most of the observed transport properties on current graphene ( and bilayer ) samples is dominated by charged impurities .",
    "in addition we have argued that both graphene and bilayers have weak temperature dependence making these materials have among the highest room temperature mobility for any field effect device .",
    "one important consequence for technology is that since mobility is limited by charged impurities , better samples can be made either by removing charged impurities in the sio@xmath6 substrate or by using different substrate ( e.g. vacuum for the case of suspended graphene and bilayers ) .",
    "attaining high mobility is also necessary to access new physics such as the fractional quantum hall effect or the `` universal '' minimum conductivity , both of which we believe is not seen in current experiments due to the large number of charged impurities .",
    "in one sense , bilayer graphene can be thought of as a new material that shares some properties with regular 2degs ( e.g. quadratic hamiltonian ) and some properties with graphene ( e.g. chiral hamiltonian ) . however , theoretically , bilayer graphene is a far more interesting , where as discussed earlier , modestly increasing the back gate voltage from that of current experiments should induce a sufficiently large carrier density to see several interesting effects . for example , a `` super - linear '' conductivity is predicted both by high - density corrections in the thomas - fermi approximation ( within the quadratic hamiltonian ) as well as by the theoretically expected crossover between the quadratic and linear hamiltonians . at",
    "even higher ( and perhaps realistic ) densities , one would expect a strong increase conductivity as one populated higher bands .",
    "the theoretical framework for understanding these high - density effects ( including the role of chirality ) and their observation remains an exciting avenue for future theoretical and experimental research . in summary",
    ", we have proposed a simple theory for bilayer graphene transport including the effects of screened coulomb impurities .",
    "the result of our self - consistent drude - boltzmann semi - classical diffusive transport theory  @xcite is in good agreement with the recent experiments of ref .   and we make several predictions that can be tested in future experiments ."
