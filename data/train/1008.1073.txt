    "since the first observation of a transiting exoplanet @xcite , knowledge of exoplanetary radii , composition and atmospheres has grown explosively . in - transit and out - of - transit spectroscopy and photometry have revealed water absorption in hd 189733b @xcite , atmospheric emission in tres-1 @xcite , a surprising number of anomalously large planets @xcite , and constraints on exoplanetary composition @xcite .",
    "accurate transit timing can also indicate the presence of additional bodies in the system through perturbations to the transiting planet s orbit @xcite .    when transits are observed in stellar lyman-@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7  and @xmath8  emission , they show much deeper minima than for visible wavelengths , revealing escaping atmospheres extending far beyond the geometric radii of planets @xcite",
    ". these light curves also constrain atmospheric conditions and mass escape from the planet s roche lobe @xcite .",
    "transit searches have been largely in the optical and near - infrared continuum , where the star is optically thick and limb darkened due to the temperature profile at the @xmath9 1 surface of the star . for limb darkened wavelengths , the flux from the transiting system is at a minimum when the planet crosses the sub - earth longitude of the star ( phase = 0.0 ) because the stellar disk is brightest at its center .",
    "by contrast , emission lines from stellar chromospheres and transition regions can be limb _",
    "brightened_. for optically thick emission , limb brightening occurs when the source function increases with stellar altitude . for optically thin emission ,",
    "strong limb brightening occurs because the chromospheric and transition region gas has its largest column density at the edges .",
    "@xcite showed that transit observations of chromospheric emission lines decrease sharply to a minimum at the first limb , increases to a local maximum mid - transit and then reverses the process as the planet exits the stellar disk .",
    "as a consequence , such a transit curve will be `` w''-shaped .",
    "@xcite point out that limb brightening could be useful for detecting exoplanetary transits of giant stars",
    ". light curves of limb brightened wavelengths have deeper minima than for both limb darkened and uniform disk emission .",
    "the star emits over a smaller effective area  a ring instead of a disk  so the planet covers a larger amount of the stellar flux .",
    "this is important for transits of giant stars where broadband transit depths can be below 0.01% for jupiter - sized planets .",
    "also , the planet covers its host s limb for a small fraction of the transit , allowing for feasible detection of giant star transits with ground based telescopes , which suffer from systematic photometric errors over timescales longer than one night .",
    "the exoplanets 4uma b , hd 122430b , hd 13189b , and hip75458 b all have transit probabilities greater than 10% and may be useful targets for future studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite approximate the limb brightened star as a central disk of emission surrounded by a circularly symmetric ring with @xmath1030 times the intensity . with this ring approximation ,",
    "the maximum depth of the transit is proportional to the ratio of the planet radius to stellar radius , @xmath11 if the emission from the central disk is negligible , instead of @xmath12 , as expected for a uniform disk .",
    "this is because the planet covers @xmath102r@xmath13 out of a circle of emission whose total circumference is 2@xmath14 .    in this paper",
    ", we present a transit light curve calculation for an optically - thin and geometrically - thin shell of emission .",
    "the calculated maximum transit depth scales as @xmath15 , instead of @xmath11 . in @xmath16[labl : chromlcurve ] we calculate the expected limb brightened light curve for an optically thin emission line .",
    "we consider optically thin emission because it shows at least 8 times the limb brightening of optically thick emission @xcite .",
    "we fit this model light curve to @xmath0  emission from hd209458 in @xmath16[osiris ] and discuss the implications for hd209458b s thermosphere in @xmath16[discuss ] .",
    "[ labl : thinshell ]    we make the approximation that the thickness of the chromosphere , @xmath17 , is much smaller than the size of the planet ( @xmath18 ) and star ( @xmath19 ) . under this geometrically thin approximation ,",
    "the total flux from the star is proportional to the surface area of the hemisphere facing the earth times its thickness @xmath17 , because the total flux for an optically thin emission line is proportional to the total number of emitting ions . neglecting any photospheric contribution , the amount of emission that the planet blocks is then simply the amount of the stellar surface that the planet covers times @xmath17 . in this geometrical limit ,",
    "therefore , the thickness of the chromosphere , @xmath17 , cancels out .",
    "emission , whose transit light curve is given by equation [ disk].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we compute the light curve for zero thickness ( @xmath20 ) by finding the area of the the planet s shadow and dividing this by the surface area of a hemisphere with radius @xmath19 .",
    "the volume of the intersection of a cylinder with a sphere is given by @xcite and we find the surface area of the intersection by taking a partial derivative with respect to the radius of the sphere .",
    "the result can be expressed analytically in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "let @xmath21 be the distance , in units of stellar radii , @xmath19 , from the center of the planet to the center of the star projected onto a plane perpendicular to the observer .",
    "let @xmath22 be the planet / star radius ratio , r@xmath13/r@xmath2 . to calculate the light curve for a planet that does not pass through the center of the star",
    ", one can simply write @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance to the closest approach point in stellar radii @xmath19 and @xmath26 is the impact parameter in stellar radii @xmath19 .",
    "the transit depth , @xmath27 is a piecewise function with three different regimes : ( 1 ) when the planet is fully contained in the stellar disk ( 2 ) when the planet is at egress / ingress and ( 3 ) when the planet is beyond the stellar disk .",
    "we also include the case that the planet s absorption profile is larger than the star . in this case , the same formulae apply ",
    "see equation [ defs ] . a small figure for each regime is included in the equations , where an open circle represents the star and a filled circle represents the planet .",
    "@xmath28 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the complete legendre elliptic integrals of the first , second , and third kinds , and @xmath33 is the heaviside step function . for the elliptic integrals , we use the conventions of @xcite where @xmath34 for the third elliptic integral . is located at ` http://www.astro.washington.edu/agol/ ` . ]",
    "these formulae are difficult to evaluate numerically at @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 due to the formal divergence of different terms in equations [ disk ] and [ defs ] ; the divergences cancel out analytically , but routines that evaluate the elliptic integrals diverge . however , these locations are a set of measure zero , and thus are tractable when modeling data .",
    "the transit is deepest slightly before second contact , so we can estimate the maximum transit depth as follows from figure [ fig01 ] by comparing the total emitting area of the star to the total stellar surface area blocked by the planet .",
    "the blocked surface is the same as the shadow produced by a sphere of radius @xmath18 onto a hemisphere of radius @xmath19 . when the planet occults the edge of the star ( second contact ) , as shown from an edge - on viewpoint in this figure , then the length of the arc of the long axis of the shadow is @xmath38 .",
    "the diameter of the planet is @xmath39 , where the latter approximation is valid for @xmath40 .",
    "we can approximate the shadow as an ellipse with a semi - minor axis of @xmath18 and a semi - major axis of @xmath41 , so the area of the shadow is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the maximum depth of transit is given by @xmath43 which is accurate to within 5% for r@xmath13/r@xmath2@xmath44 0.23 .",
    "note that this is a different scaling for maximum transit depth than that given in @xcite who assume that most of the stellar emission is from a thin ring . for r@xmath13/r@xmath2  = @xmath45 ,",
    "half of the stellar emission is within @xmath18 of the stellar radius @xmath19 , so for r@xmath13/r@xmath2  @xmath46 , the ring approximation is valid , but the scaling of transit depth assumes negligible limb curvature at the scale of the planet ( r@xmath13/r@xmath2  @xmath47 1 ) .",
    "the remarkable consequence of equation [ depth_anal ] is that the depth of a chromospheric transit does not decline as much with the radius of the planet as a transit of a uniform disk .",
    "a chromospheric transit has a maximum depth that is @xmath48 times deeper than the maximum transit depth of a uniform disk ; thus smaller planets have an advantage to be observed at chromospheric wavelengths , as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that at mid - transit , the double - u curve has a smaller transit depth than for a uniform disk , because the planet covers only @xmath49 out of a hemisphere of area @xmath50 .",
    "figure 3 ( solid curve ) shows the transit light curve , 1-@xmath27 , for a planet that has r@xmath13/r@xmath2=0.08 .",
    "the estimate given by equation [ depth_anal ] and the more detailed equation [ disk ] agree well , predicting maximum chromospheric depths to be 1.8 times deeper than for uniform disk brightness .",
    "( for a uniform disk emission @xmath51=@xmath52 ) .",
    "we also include a light curve for the thin circle of emission shown in figure [ limbmodel ] b for comparison .",
    "[ fig02 ]    emission from the solar limb as observed by sumer ( solar ultraviolet measurement of emitted radiation ) @xcite is strongly limb - brightened , indicating that a transit of this emission line should have a double - u light curve .",
    "( b ) @xmath53  304   image of the solar limb , taken by the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope @xcite is , by contrast , not limb brightened because it is optically thick in the chromosphere and thus the additional column density at the limb does not contribute any more flux than the central disk.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "@xcite observed the exoplanet host hd 209458 with the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument and found an extended hydrogen , oxygen and carbon atmosphere around the planet by fitting the light curves to the @xmath54 , @xmath8  and @xmath5  lines during a transit .",
    "@xcite found no @xmath0  absorption when fitting the light curve to a model of a spherical planet occulting a _ uniform _ stellar disk .",
    "we fit their @xmath0  1394   data ( @xcite , figure 3 ) with a double - u model given by equation [ disk ] .",
    "this model is appropriate for the @xmath0  emission , as evident in the solar image in figure [ limbs ] ( a ) where strong limb - brightening is apparent .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath0  1394 / @xmath0  1403   ratio is 2:1 within the errors , indicating that the @xmath0  1394   emission is optically thin @xcite .",
    "we investigated the transit of the @xmath0  line because it the strongest optically thin line in hd209458b s stis spectrum . while other limb brightened emission lines",
    "do exist , we focus on the optically thin ones because they should be the most limb brightened .",
    "the model has two free parameters : the planet / star radius ratio r@xmath13/r@xmath2  and an overall constant that sets the off - transit flux .",
    "the second parameter is necessary since the off - transit @xmath0  1394   stis flux is poorly constrained .",
    "the impact parameter is fixed with a value of @xmath55 , using an inclination of 86.7@xmath56 and a semi - major axis @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the light curve for the @xcite data and the best fit model .",
    "in addition to the best fit model , we show two more limb brightened models where r@xmath13/r@xmath2  is a fixed parameter for comparison",
    ". these have r@xmath13/r@xmath2  equal to 0 and 0.12 , representing no @xmath0  absorption and the geometric planet radius @xcite , respectively . using a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm @xcite and the points at which the @xmath58 = 1 to calculate uncertainties , we find that r@xmath13/r@xmath2  = 0.34@xmath3 , close to the size of the roche lobe .",
    "the double - u model has a total @xmath59 of 10.4 with 12 data points and two parameters , which is 3.1 less than fitting the data to a constant flux line ( representing no detection ) with one parameter .",
    "since these models are nested , we can use the maximum likelihood ratio test .",
    "the p - value for the difference in @xmath59 is 0.05 , so the data favor the double - u model with 95% confidence , assuming normally distributed data .",
    "the same test favors the r@xmath13/r@xmath2  = 0.34 model over the r@xmath13/r@xmath2  = 0.12 model with 91% confidence .",
    "as indicated by the solar image of @xmath0  in figure [ limbs ] , a limb brightened model should be used for @xmath0  emission . the double - u model for the @xmath0  transit",
    "fits the data better than a non - detection , even when accounting for the additional parameters in the model .",
    "the best fit absorption radius r@xmath13/r@xmath2=0.34@xmath3 , if the absorption is entirely optically thick .",
    "this radius favors planetary atmosphere models with mass flow beyond the planet s roche lobe .",
    "the best time to observe transits in optically thin stellar emission lines is when a planet crosses its host s limb and not at a phase of 0 , since the double - u curve is deepest at the stellar limb .",
    "observations at the limb have a depth of @xmath100.5 ( r@xmath13/r@xmath2)@xmath60 whereas at the center of the star they have a transit depth of @xmath100.5 ( r@xmath13/r@xmath2)@xmath61 , only half the depth of a uniform brightness transit .",
    "the @xmath0  transit depth is comparable to the @xmath8  transit depth calculated by @xcite and larger than the @xmath54  transit depth calculated by @xcite .",
    "as @xcite point out , a hard sphere , which we assume in equation [ disk ] , is a poor approximation to planetary atmospheric absorption . the @xmath0  absorption profile , instead of having a sharp transition from opaque to transparent , should change smoothly from optically thick to optically thin absorption in a more accurate model . in order to explain the large transit depth , this smooth model would have to have a radius extending beyond the planet s roche lobe to explain the observed transit depth .",
    "r@xmath62/r@xmath2 varies from 0.35 to 0.48 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit transit depth supports models with high concentrations of metallic ions in the atmosphere because the radius of @xmath0  absorption is as large as for @xmath54  absorption .",
    "@xcite point out that if the metallicity is high , the temperature must also be elevated . the @xmath1010,000 k temperature suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the thermosphere may not explain the large abundances of si@xmath63 needed for the observed absorption .",
    "the ionization energy , @xmath64 for si@xmath65 si@xmath63 = @xmath66k , suggests that the si@xmath63 may be produced in a shock between the stellar and planetary winds .",
    "@xcite find no significant @xmath0  absorption by hd209458b .",
    "our best fit to the stis data predicts the average transit depth to be 9@xmath67% for the same phases as their observations , but @xcite , with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) , found 0.2 @xmath68 1.4% .",
    "these results disagree at the @xmath101.7@xmath69 level and variability in the planet s atmosphere may account for the discrepancy .",
    "@xcite did observe some weak @xmath0  absorption features found at + 20 and + 40km / s in their spectrum , which indicates that some si@xmath63 ions remain in the planet s atmosphere or winds .",
    "@xcite suggest that the amount of another silicon ion , si@xmath70 , may vary appreciably over short timescales because of changes in stellar wind speed , planetary mass - loss rate or temperature fluctuations .",
    "conversely to @xmath0 , for which 2003 stis observations indicate strong absorption and 2009 cos observations indicate weak absorption , the @xmath6  absorption is seen strongly in absorption in the 2009 cos data and weakly in the 2003 stis data .",
    "additional observations will help confirm or refute the detection of si@xmath63 in the thermosphere of hd209458b .",
    "the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) is an ideal instrument with 2 to 10 times the sensitivity of previous ultraviolet spectrographs @xcite .",
    "cos was used by @xcite , but only when hd209458b was close to a phase of 0.0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 0.75 and once when the planet was at the stellar limb .",
    "additional observation at the host s limb would be optimal for @xmath0  and other optically thin emission lines . with enough signal to noise ,",
    "the light curve may reveal asymmetries in the transit having to do with an asymmetric spatial distribution of the uv - absorbing cloud .",
    "the advantage of the limb brightened emission lines is that they come from a smaller spatial area of the star and therefore probe the spatial distribution of the planetary atmosphere better than optically thick emission .",
    "accurate time resolved transit data may also reveal differences in _ thermal _ properties of the leading and trailing sides of the planet as predicted by @xcite .",
