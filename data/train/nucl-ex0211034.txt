    "recently the @xmath8 collaboration at jinr , carrying out searches for the @xmath0 decoupled dibaryon resonances in the reaction @xmath9 at an energy below the @xmath10 threshold @xcite , has reported @xcite the observation of such a state with a mass of about 1956 mev , which was called @xmath1 .",
    "the conclusion for the existence of this resonance was drawn from the analysis of the energy spectrum for energetic ( @xmath11 mev ) coincident photons emitted at angles of @xmath2 in the laboratory system from the reaction @xmath9 at an energy of about 216 mev .",
    "the measured spectrum shown in fig.1 consists of a narrow peak at a photon energy of about 24 mev and a relatively broad peak in the energy range ( 45 - 75 ) mev .",
    "the statistical significances for the narrow and broad peaks are 5.3@xmath12 and 3.5@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the width of the narrow peak ( fwhm ) is about 8 mev , compatible with that of experimental resolution .",
    "this behavior of the photon spectrum conforms to the signature of the @xmath0 decoupled dibaryon resonance @xmath1(1956 ) that is believed to be formed in the radiative process @xmath13 and then to decay via the @xmath14 mode , thereby contributing to the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the photon energy spectrum calculated with the help of monte carlo simulations under the assumption that the process @xmath15 is the only mechanism of the @xmath16 reaction proved to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental one .",
    "the differential cross section of the resonance production of two photons emitted symmetrically at @xmath17 from the process @xmath18 at an energy of 216 mev was estimated to be @xmath19 9 nb / sr@xmath20 .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath1(1956 ) production in the @xmath21 reaction at 216 mev found as a result of multiplying this differential cross section by @xmath22 amounts to about 1.4 @xmath23 .",
    "the existence of the @xmath1(1956 ) resonance implies , in particular , that in addition to the conventional mechanisms of photon production in @xmath0 interactions below the @xmath10 threshold there should exist a new one , the dibaryon mechanism @xmath24 .",
    "obviously , depending on kinematical conditions of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 reactions this mechanism would make some contribution to inclusive photon energy spectra of these reactions .",
    "such a contribution should be mainly concentrated in two photon energy regions specific for this dibaryon resonance , which are determined by energies of photons arising from the @xmath1(1956 ) formation and decay . in the center - of - mass system ,",
    "the energy of a photon connected with the dibaryon formation ( @xmath27 ) is determined by its mass @xmath28 and the energy of colliding nucleons ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 , while the energy of a photon associated with the radiative dibaryon decay ( @xmath31 ) in the rest frame of this resonance is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the invariant mass of the final @xmath0 state populated as a result of this decay .",
    "the contribution from the dibaryon mechanism to the photon energy spectrum of the @xmath25 or @xmath26 reaction would compete with a substantial contribution from the conventional mechanisms .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath34 collisions even at an energy below the @xmath10 threshold one should have in view the additional contribution from @xmath35 decays produced in @xmath0 collisions due to the nucleon fermi motion in nuclei . at the same time , since the bremsstrahlung cross section in @xmath36 scattering at energies around 200 mev is substantially larger than that for @xmath37 scattering , one can expect that the contribution of the dibaryon mechanism in @xmath36 and , hence , in @xmath34 scattering is also larger than in @xmath37 scattering .    in search of further evidence for the existence of the @xmath1(1956 ) dibaryon resonance we decided to analyze the available experimental data on photon production in @xmath0 and @xmath34 collisions at energies below the @xmath10 threshold resulting in the photon energy spectra of the processes explored .",
    "the inclusive photon energy spectrum of the reaction @xmath38 was measured at a neutron energy of 170@xmath3935 mev for high energy photons ( @xmath40 mev ) emitted at the angle @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this spectrum ( data were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and binned in 6 mev energy interval to reduce their statistical fluctuations ) is shown in fig . 2a",
    "together with the prediction of the obe model @xcite folded with a gaussian with @xmath42 mev to allow for an energy spread of an incident beam and detector resolution . a resonance - like structure in the energy range from 45 to 75 mev",
    "is clearly seen in this spectrum . at the same time",
    "the calculated photon energy spectrum does not contain even a hint of the presence of any structure there . to solve the problem of this structure",
    "the authors @xcite assumed that it was caused by the contribution from a capture process , that is , the process @xmath43 , which was not included in the calculations @xcite .",
    "but since such a process ( see fig .",
    "2a ) should contribute in an energy range extending beyond the structure in question , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the authors @xcite had incorrectly calibrated the energy response of their @xmath4 detector and so the capture peak was shifted by about 20 mev . however , if this is not the case and at least the shape of the @xmath5 spectrum @xcite is correct , then the question arises : what is the reason for this structure origin ? in fig .",
    "2a we also show the energy spectrum of photons ( @xmath44 20 mev ) emitted at @xmath45 from the process @xmath46 at 170@xmath3935 mev calculated by the monte carlo method for the @xmath1(1956 ) production cross section of 4.3 @xmath23 .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath1(1956 ) contribution to the @xmath5 photon spectrum lies in the same energy range as the structure of interest and therefore the dibaryon mechanism can be considered as a likely cause for appearance of this structure . in this connection",
    "the existing photon energy spectra of the @xmath47 @xcite reaction are of particular interest .",
    "this is because for low and intermediate photon energies the @xmath48 spectrum is a good approximation to the free @xmath5 spectrum and thus it should reflect features inherent in the @xmath49 reaction .",
    "the inclusive @xmath6 photon energy spectra were measured at an incident energy of 200 mev by the grenoble group @xcite and at 145 and 195 mev by the michigan state group @xcite .",
    "the spectra measured by those groups for @xmath41 at an energy of 200 mev and 195 mev are in excellent agreement .",
    "the experimental @xcite and calculated @xcite inclusive photon energy spectra of the @xmath6 reaction at 195 mev and @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "we see again that the experimental spectrum clearly exhibits a characteristic structure in the range ( 45 - 75 ) mev , the presence of which leads to serious disagreement between the experimental and theoretical data .",
    "this fact makes it reasonable to assume that the structure observed in the energy range ( 45 - 75 ) mev of both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 inclusive photon spectra can arise from the same underlying mechanism .",
    "we believe that such a mechanism is the dibaryon mechanism in question . in fig .",
    "2b we show the dibaryon mechanism contribution to the @xmath6 photon energy spectrum for the @xmath1(1956 ) production cross section of 9.4 @xmath23 calculated by the monte carlo method with the fermi motion of nucleons in the deuteron taken into account . simply adding this contribution to the theoretical spectrum @xcite we find that the agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra becomes significantly better .",
    "finally , the inclusive photon energy spectra were also measured in @xmath50 collisions @xcite .",
    "obviously , the clearest manifestation of the dibaryon mechanism should be anticipated in spectra for light nuclei . in fig .",
    "2c we show the inclusive photon energy spectrum for carbon ( lighter nucleus ) measured at an energy of 200 mev and corrected for the @xmath35 contribution @xcite .",
    "the structure in the energy range ( 45 - 75 ) mev is also seen in this spectrum , it is very likely to be of the same origin as that observed in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra . in fig . 2c",
    "we also show the dibaryon mechanism contribution to the @xmath51 photon energy spectrum for the @xmath1(1956 ) production cross section of 56.5 @xmath23 .",
    "we can see that this contribution is situated in the same energy region as the structure in question .",
