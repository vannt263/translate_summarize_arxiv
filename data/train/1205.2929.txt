    "the interaction of relativistic electrons with low energy radiation through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) provides one of the principal @xmath0-ray production processes in astrophysics . in a variety of astrophysical environments , from very compact objects like pulsars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to extended sources like supernova remnants and clusters of galaxies , low energy photons",
    "are effectively boosted to high energies through this mechanism .",
    "the basic features of the ics have been analyzed by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the case of anisotropic electrons and/or photons has been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the impact of the klein - nishina effect on the formation of the energy distribution of electrons was first realized by @xcite .",
    "its importance in astrophysics has been discussed in the literature in the context of different non thermal phenomena , in particular by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "generally , the energy spectrum as well as the effects related to ics are numerically calculated using the exact expression for the compton cross section . on the other hand , compact",
    ", analytical approximations can serve as useful tools for a deeper understanding of the properties of compton radiation and the implications of the complex numerical calculations .",
    "in particular , inferring the energy distribution of the parent particles from the observed spectrum is a much more efficient procedure when analytical approximations are available .",
    "for example , a power - law distribution of electrons normally results in power - law photon spectra . if the observed photon index is @xmath1 ( in a @xmath2 representation ) ,",
    "then we can obtain the power - law index of the electron distribution @xmath3 from the relation @xmath4 for the thomson regime and @xmath5 if the scattering occurs in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "this however only applies to the energy interval far from the cut - off , the `` main '' part of the electron distribution . at the highest ( and lowest ) energies , there should be a break / cut - off in the electron distribution and in fact , the corresponding break at the radiation spectrum contains a lot of interesting information on the parent electrons . in particular , the peaks in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) appear at this energy range in the majority of cases , indicating that the source luminosity is mostly radiated at the maximum cut - off .",
    "moreover , as the main , power - law part of the distribution , the shape of the cut - off carries as well important implication for the acceleration of the particles and in general the mechanisms acting in the source .",
    "although the shape of the spectrum close to the highest energy cut - off is critical , this topic has not yet been adequately addressed . in this paper",
    "we examine the shape of the compton spectrum close to the maximum cut - off and we derive convenient analytical formulas that allow to approximate the radiated flux in this specific energy range . in general , the shape of the electron distribution around the cut - off can be expressed as an exponential , @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this allows us to describe a quite broad range of distributions , even very sharp , abrupt , step - function like cut - offs for @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the convenience of such a mathematical description , exponential cut - offs naturally arise in theoretical considerations .",
    "for example , in diffusive shock acceleration , power - law particle distributions with exponential cut - off are formed when ( synchrotron ) energy losses are taken into account @xcite and the cut - off index is very important for investigating the acceleration mechanism .",
    "analytic solutions show that in the case of bohm diffusion a simple exponential cut - off @xmath8}$ ] arises , whereas the index approaches @xmath9 if @xmath10 type energy losses are taken into account , e.g. synchrotron or thomson losses ( see @xcite ) . in stochastic acceleration scenarios , where pile - up particle distributions are formed when",
    "acceleration is balanced by synchrotron type losses , the shape of the electron cut - off is directly related to the assumed turbulent wave spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite ) , e.g. @xmath11 for kolmogorov , @xmath12 for kraicman like or @xmath9 for the hard sphere approximation .",
    "of course , if more complicated energy losses dominate , like in the case of klein - nishina losses in radiation - dominated environments , more complex shapes for the electron distribution cut - off may be expected in both stochastic and diffusive shock acceleration scenarios ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) nevertheless , it seems reasonable to consider particle distributions that exhibit exponential cut - off in a general form , for investigating and modeling the radiated spectra . in @xcite and @xcite , the shape of the synchrotron spectrum close to the high energy cut - off has been discussed .",
    "they found that when the electron distribution possesses an exponential cut - off of index @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] , then the radiated synchrotron spectrum exhibits a smoother cut - off , of index @xmath15 .",
    "apart from the practical importance , this analytic result demonstrates that a @xmath16-function approximation for the synchrotron radiation emissivity does not give the correct result .",
    "here we examine the corresponding compton spectrum , in the thomson and klein - nishina regimes , considering different target photon fields so that both synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and external compton ( ec ) scattering can be addressed .",
    "we derive analytically the asymptotic behavior of the up - scattered photon distribution close to the cut - off region .",
    "we consider a general electron energy distribution of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron energy and @xmath19 is the cut - off energy .",
    "this presentation allows us to consider either a power - law distribution ( for @xmath20 ) with exponential cut - off or a relativistic maxwell - like distribution ( for @xmath21 ) , that may be formed in stochastic acceleration scenarios .",
    "we consider monochromatic , planckian and synchrotron photons as target photon fields .",
    "the resulting ic spectral shape is discussed for the thomson and the klein - nishina regime and we show that is not always identical to the synchrotron spectrum , as is often silently assumed .",
    "finally , we discuss basic features and physical properties of the radiated spectrum .",

    "when all the scatterings occur in the thomson regime , the photons take a small fraction of the electron energy .",

    "this happens because since @xmath82 for the electron cut - off energy it holds for all the energies @xmath83 that actually form the shape of the exponential cut - off . on the contrary ,",
    "for the thomson regime one needs all the radiated photons above the cut - off to be emitted at this regime , which indicates rather small values of @xmath28 for the approximation to be good , especially for low @xmath13 factors .",

    "the thomson spectrum cut - off energy is smaller by a factor of @xmath177^{(\\beta+2)/2}$ ] .",
    "this factor is not negligible especially for small @xmath13 , e.g. it takes values of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 for @xmath116 respectively ( almost one order of magnitude for a simple exponential cut - off ) .",
    "as expected , it tends to unity for @xmath59 .",
    "it does not depend however on index @xmath61 of the electron distribution .    for synchrotron radiation , from eq .",
    "( [ synbeta ] ) , we find the cut - off energy @xmath181 which reveals exactly the same factor as in the case of thomson spectrum for planckian photons , but now in respect to the characteristic energy @xmath182 .",

    "( [ sscbeta ] ) gives @xmath183 if we compare the cut - off energy with e.g. @xmath184 then the factor related to the index @xmath13 takes values of @xmath185 for @xmath116 , slightly less than in the case of a planckian target photon field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cut - off shape is now smoother .",
    "these analytic results are useful when modeling the observed spectrum , as one may infer the electron distribution cut - off energy from the photon spectrum cut - off energy with only the uncertainty introduced by a ( possible ) doppler boosting .",
    "the position and the amplitude of the synchrotron and ic peaks in the sed contain very important information about physical parameters of non thermal sources , like the strength of the average magnetic field and the energy density of relativistic electrons .",
    "the shape of the sed , especially in the region of the cutoffs of the synchrotron and ic components of radiation , provide additional , more detailed information about the distributions of electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "for example , the spectral cutoff in the ic component formed in the the klein - nishina regime provides direct , model - independent information about the energy spectrum of highest energy electrons .",
    "this is a critical issue for understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , combined with the shape of the synchrotron cut - off , it can allow us to extract information about the distribution of the magnetic field .",
    "this can be demonstrated by the following simple example .",
    "let as assume that we have observed a smooth synchrotron cut - off which can be interpreted as the result of an electron distribution with an exponential index e.g. @xmath186 .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked by the shape of the cut - off of the ic component .",
    "if the latter is formed in the klein - nishina regime , and exhibits a sharp cut - off behavior indicating to the electron distribution with @xmath187 , then one should attribute the smoothness of the synchrotron cut - off to magnetic field inhomogeneities rather than to the actual shape of the electron distribution .",

    "in this paper we have examined the asymptotic behavior of the compton spectrum close to the maximum cut - off .",
    "we assumed that the electron distribution follows the general formula @xmath188 $ ] so that our analysis may account for a relativistic maxwellian - type distribution , as well as for a power - law distribution with exponential cut - off .",
    "the exponential cut - off of the electron energy spectrum results in an exponential cut - off in the compton spectrum , of the form @xmath189 $ ] , with @xmath190 and @xmath172 the corresponding cut - off index and energy respectively .",
    "we show that in the klein - nishina regime , the cut - off index remains unchanged , @xmath191 .",
    "the shape of the up - scattered spectrum close to the maximum cut - off basically `` reflects '' the electron distribution and does not depend strongly on the target photon field .",
    "the cut - off energy also correspond to the electron distribution cut - off energy , @xmath192 .    in the thomson regime ,",
    "the resulting spectrum close to the cut - off is very different .",
    "first of all it strongly depends on the up - scattered photon field .",
    "monoenergetic photons lead to a cut - off of index @xmath193 , whereas planckian photons result in @xmath194 .",
    "when the up - scattered photon field is the synchrotron photon field , as in ssc models , then the cut - off appears extremely smooth , with an index @xmath195 .",
    "in contrast to the klein - nishina regime , the thomson spectrum cut - off energy @xmath172 depends not only on the electron distribution cut - off energy , but also on the target photon field and as well on the index @xmath13 .",
    "the obtained analytic expressions are useful for deriving the electron spectral shape at the cut - off region directly from the observed high energy flux",
    ". these two parameters may give important insight into the acceleration and radiation mechanisms acting in the source .",
    "furthermore , one may use the higher energy part of the observed compton spectrum as a `` diagnostic tool '' to distinguish between ec and ssc models , as different photon fields lead to different cut - off shapes ."
