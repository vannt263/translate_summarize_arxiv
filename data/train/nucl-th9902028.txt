    "over the past years , eta photoproduction has demonstrated its potential as a new , powerful tool to selectively probe certain resonances that are difficult to explore with pions .",
    "it is well known that the low energy behavior of the eta production process is governed by the @xmath11 resonance @xcite .",
    "the recent , precise measurements of total and differential cross sections for eta photoproduction at low energies @xcite have made it possible to determine the @xmath11 resonance parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "a well - known example of the power of the @xmath12 reaction is the extraction of the @xmath13 helicity amplitude of the @xmath11 state . due to the combined cusp - resonance nature of this resonance , analyses based solely on pion",
    "photoproduction consistently underestimate this quantity with values of about @xmath14 @xcite , while extractions from eta photoproduction result in numbers nearly twice as high @xcite .",
    "recent coupled - channels analyses @xcite that properly include cusp as well as resonance phenomena have confirmed a range of values consistent with eta photoproduction .    however , because of the overwhelming dominance of the @xmath15 the influence of other resonances in the same energy regime , such as the @xmath4 , is difficult to discern .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that polarization observables provide a new doorway to access these non - dominant resonances by use of interference of the dominant @xmath0 multipole with the smaller multipoles . in particular , the polarized photon asymmetry was shown to be sensitive to the @xmath4 .",
    "it is well - known that , in principle , for a completely model - independent multipole analysis seven single and double polarization observables have to be measured along with the differential cross section for all isospin channels .",
    "however , in practice , the recent extraction of the small @xmath16 multipole at the @xmath17(1232 ) energy @xcite demonstrates that the use of a few reasonable assumptions permits an almost model - independent analysis with a restricted set of observables for a limited energy range .",
    "recently , polarization data for the target and photon asymmetries in eta photoproduction were measured at elsa @xcite and graal @xcite , respectively , for the first time .",
    "combining these data with the unpolarized cross sections from mami , we have performed an almost model - independent multipole analysis of the @xmath18 and 2 eta photoproduction multipoles at threshold .",
    "this permits a precise determination of the @xmath4 contribution and an extraction of new @xmath4 resonance parameters .",
    "the three measured observables are represented by the response functions of @xcite as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the absolute values of the eta and photon momenta , respectively , and here and in the following all variables are expressed in the @xmath22 frame .",

    "if both the @xmath11 and the @xmath4 are parameterized by breit - wigner functions ( as in the case of the isobar model @xcite ) , this phase difference would be rather constant , because both resonances are very close in energy and , furthermore , have similar resonance widths .",

    "other models based on either a coupled - channels approach @xcite or on a tree - level effective lagrangian analysis @xcite , have similar problems to reproduce the target asymmetry .",
    "it is therefore imperative that this measurement be verified as soon as possible .    after performing single - energy fits we used a polynomial form for the energy dependence of the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath89 , @xmath35 , @xmath28 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 of eqs .",

    "therefore , a combined fit can reduce the uncertainty of individual measurements considerably . in a simple taylor expansion in terms of the eta momentum with only 1 to 3 parameters in each coefficient , we obtain good results for the energy region from threshold up to about 900 mev . using polynomials as a function of @xmath90 as shown in table [ tab2 ]",

    "finally , the strong rise in the coefficient @xmath70 around @xmath91 shows the excitation of the @xmath8 resonance , which was measured just up to the resonance peak expected at @xmath92 .",
    "an experiment at even higher energies is now in progress at graal with the aim to confirm the resonance behavior .      with the definitions given in appendix a we are now in a position to determine the helicity amplitudes and/or branching ratios .",
