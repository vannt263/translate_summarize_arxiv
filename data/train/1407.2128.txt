    "the mass of the heavy quarkonium ground state has been computed to increasingly higher order in perturbation theory over the years @xcite , presently reaching nnnlo precision , i.e. @xmath5 . the use of effective field theory methods @xcite was important for reaching this accuracy .",
    "one of the main motivations for this ongoing effort is the possibility to obtain accurate determinations of the bottom and ( may be ) charm quark masses by equating these theoretical expressions to the experimental values @xcite . this possibility is reinforced by the fact that the renormalon of the pole mass cancels with the renormalon of the static potential  @xcite making these energies mainly perturbative objects , and , therefore , ideal candidates for good determinations of the heavy quark masses .",
    "taking advantage of this fact requires the use of the so - called threshold masses ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , which explicitly take into account the cancellation between the pole mass and the static potential renormalon .",
    "one of these analysis was made in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reference",
    "the nnlo expression of the heavy quarkonium ground state mass was used , as well as some partial nnnlo effects ( those obtained from the large-@xmath6 approximation @xcite , as well as the leading @xmath5 logarithms @xcite ) to obtain an accurate determination of the bottom mass .",
    "the charm quark was considered to be active and its mass approximated to zero .",
    "the threshold mass used was the so - called renormalon subtracted ( rs ) mass .",
    "this mass is defined such that the leading renormalon of the pole mass is explicitly subtracted .",
    "therefore , it requires the knowledge of the normalization of the renormalon , which was also approximately computed in that reference .",
    "there is a series of developments that motivate updating such analysis .",
    "one obvious improvement would be the incorporation of the charm quark mass effects .",
    "for the case of the heavy quarkonium mass ( versus the pole mass ) it was concluded that the charm quark decoupled and it was a good approximation to consider the theory with only three active massless flavours @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that one should also use this approximation for the relation between the pole and the @xmath3 mass , producing much smaller shifts than if working with four active flavours .",
    "therefore , the calculation should be redone accordingly .",
    "it is also possible to improve the determination of the normalization of the pole mass ( and the static potential ) leading renormalon , @xmath7 . on the one hand",
    "the existence of the three - loop expression of the static potential allows the determination of @xmath7 to one order higher in the corresponding expansion . on the other hand , recent analysis in lattice simulations @xcite",
    "suggest that the direct determination of @xmath7 from the last known coefficients of the perturbative series may actually produce more accurate results than previous estimates , which were obtained using the borel transform of the perturbative series as their key quantity .",
    "such improved value would have an immediate impact in heavy quark physics in general , and in the determination of the heavy quark mass from the heavy quarkonium spectrum in particular .",
    "with respect to the latter , the complete nnnlo correction to the perturbative expression of the @xmath2 mass is now known . by including the complete nnnlo expression we can study this term without scheme ambiguity and assess its impact .",
    "even more important , at this order ultrasoft effects appear for the first time .",
    "there is the worry that physics at the ultrasoft scale can not be computed in perturbation theory .",
    "the reason is that the natural scale associated to those degrees of freedom is of order @xmath8 , which , up to numerical factors , is a low scale . yet , there have been some analysis where the ultrasoft scale has been treated in perturbation theory . for instance , in ref  @xcite the perturbative expression of the static potential ( which includes ultrasoft effects ) was compared with lattice simulations .",
    "also in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the nonperturbative effects are small for the low states of heavy quarkonium .",
    "on the other hand two existing analyses that incorporate the nnnlo expression yield bigger values of @xmath9 @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we would like to quantify the real impact of these corrections , as it is important to know what pure perturbation theory has to say before asking for non - perturbative corrections .",
    "finally , the existence of the complete nnnlo result allows to compare with the large-@xmath6 estimate of the nnnlo correction , and see how reliable such approximation is .    in sec .",
