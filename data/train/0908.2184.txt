    "the interest in the studies of clusters is largely because of their possible technological applications which include the possibilities of developing novel cluster - based materials using the size dependence of their properties .",
    "doping of clusters is an important possibility in this direction . in recent times",
    "the fabrication of alloy clusters of different sizes with well defined , controlled properties by varying the composition and atomic ordering , has caught considerable attention.@xcite bimetallic alloy clusters have been known and exploited for last few years in various applications , specially in the catalytic reactions.@xcite varying the ratio of the two constituents , one can alter the surface structures , compositions and segregation properties.@xcite in this way , it is possible to tune the chemical reactivity at the surface of an alloyed cluster.@xcite considering the huge possibility of using nano clusters in catalysis , the study of cluster reactivity has become an interdisciplinary topic of present day research.@xcite    about two decades ago , nonose _",
    "et al _ measured the reactivity towards h@xmath3 of bimetallic co@xmath4v@xmath2 ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ) clusters using laser vaporization technique and reported strong cluster size and composition dependence.@xcite both v and co are 3@xmath8 transition metals .",
    "the substitution of co by v atoms , one by one , should increase the reactivity of the alloy cluster towards h@xmath3 molecules , as v , an early transition metal , has a high reactivity towards h@xmath3 in contrast to co which has relatively low reactivity.@xcite interestingly , it was found that the reactivity increased gradually , as expected , with the substitution of co atom by v atom one by one in the co@xmath4 clusters ( @xmath5 @xmath9 13 ) , but for the co@xmath0 , there was a remarkable decrease in reactivity when a single co atom was substituted by a v atom . however , the reactivity increased as the number of exchange v - atoms increased further up to @xmath10 3 , while the fourth v - atom substitution did not increase the reactivity any more . in view of the high reactivity of elemental",
    "v , this sudden drop in reactivity of the co@xmath11v cluster was rather surprising .",
    "the authors speculated a plausible icosahedral structure for the co@xmath11v cluster with the active v atom at the cage center .",
    "therefore , the v atom , being shielded geometrically from @xmath12 by the twelve surface co atoms , might have less chance to interact with h - atoms . the chemisorption reactivity of cationic co@xmath1v@xmath13 clusters @xcite and anionic co@xmath1v@xmath14 clusters @xcite also shows similar type of variation as that of neutral co@xmath1v@xmath2 clusters , which hints towards the dominant effect of geometric structure as compared to the electronic structure . for clusters ,",
    "the ionization potential ( ip ) depends on the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) level . for the pure metal clusters , whetten _",
    "et al _ have postulated that the reaction rate for cluster - h@xmath3 dissociative chemisorption is determined by the charge transfer from the homo to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the reactant gas h@xmath3 , and an anti - correlation between ip and reaction coefficient could be observed.@xcite that means lower value of ip corresponds to higher reactivity and vice versa . however , the ionization energies of the co@xmath4v@xmath2 clusters , measured by hoshino _ et al _ using photo - ionization spectroscopy show no such anti - correlation,@xcite again demonstrating the importance of geometrical structure .",
    "a rigorous first - principles study in terms of geometric and electronic effects is therefore very much needed to understand this anomalous nature of reactivity of co@xmath1v@xmath2 ( @xmath10 0 - 4 ) clusters . in this report , we have carried out an _ ab - initio _ theoretical study on v doped co@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the whole study can be divided into three major parts : first part consists of an exhaustive search for the minimum energy structures ( mes ) for cluster of each composition , followed by stability analysis of these mes in terms of various physical quantities in the second part , while the final part includes investigation of chemisorbed structures and understanding of cluster reactivity .",
    "the calculations have been performed using density functional theory ( dft ) , within the pseudopotential plane wave method as implemented in vasp code.@xcite we have used the projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite and the perdew - bruke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite for spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the 3@xmath8 and 4@xmath15 electrons were treated as the valence electrons for the transition metal elements and the wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off of 335 ev . the convergence of the cluster energies with respect to the cut - off value has been checked .",
    "reciprocal space integrations were carried out at the @xmath16 point .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry and spin optimizations were performed using the conjugate gradient and the quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components were less than a threshold value of 0.005 ev /  . in order to ensure the structural trends found in the optimized structures , we have also carried out bohn - openheimer molecular dynamics @xcite within lda for few specific clusters .",
    "simple cubic super - cells were used for cluster calculations with the periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters were kept separated by at least 12  vacuum space to make the interaction between the cluster images negligible .",
    "the cohesive energy ( @xmath17 ) of a co@xmath4v@xmath2 alloy cluster is calculated with respect to the free atoms as @xmath18 where @xmath19(co@xmath4v@xmath2 ) , @xmath19(co ) and @xmath19(v ) are the total energies of co@xmath4v@xmath2 cluster , an isolated co atom and an isolated v atom respectively .",
    "one can also define the cohesive energy with respect to the co and v bulk phases at equilibrium instead of isolated atoms .",
    "however , the cohesive energy variation with increasing v - concentration follows the same trend irrespective of the way of cohesive energy definition .",
    "the second difference in energy for fixed size ( @xmath20 constant ) and variable composition is defined as @xmath21 it gives the relative stability of alloy clusters having nearby compositions .",
    "since chemical reaction with clusters takes place on its surface , the atomic arrangement and the composition of cluster surface play an important role in chemical reactivity .",
    "therefore , the first step towards the theoretical modeling of clusters is to determine their ground state structure . in our earlier",
    "work,@xcite we studied the structure and magnetism of the pure co clusters in detail . to obtain the mes having the optimized geometry as well as the optimized magnetic moment , we considered several probable starting geometries having closed packed atomic arrangement and allowed each of the geometries to relax for _ all possible _ collinear spin configurations of the atoms .",
    "we follow the same way of structural optimization here for the v doped co clusters ( co@xmath1v@xmath2 ; @xmath10 1 - 4 ) . however , the situation for alloy clusters is quite cumbersome as one has to deal with a large number of starting geometries because of the presence of _ homotops _ ( the term was first coined by jellinek @xcite ) .",
    "homotops _ have the same number of atoms , composition and geometrical structure , but differ in the arrangement of the doped atoms . as for example",
    ", a single geometrical structure of an a@xmath4b@xmath2 alloy cluster with fixed number of atoms ( @xmath22 ) and composition ( @xmath23 ratio ) , will give , in principle , @xmath24 _ homotops_. some of them , however , may be symmetry equivalent and the number of the inequivalent _ homotops _ will be somewhat less than the above mentioned value .",
    "so the variety of structures in alloy clusters is much richer than that of the pure clusters and the potential energy surface of even a small cluster of few tens of atoms is of enormous complexity .",
    "it is generally found that the transition metal clusters prefer compact geometries to maximize the interaction between the rather localized @xmath8 orbitals.@xcite there are three most compact and highly coordinated structures for 13 atoms cluster : icosahedron , cub - octahedron and hexagonal closed packed ( hcp ) geometries .",
    "we have therefore considered these three geometries as the most probable starting structures . for the pure co@xmath0 cluster",
    ", we found that the mes is a distorted hcp geometry with total magnetic moment of 25 @xmath25 and total cohesive energy of 42.63 ev as mentioned in our previous work.@xcite the structure has 22 triangular faces and 33 edges ( cf .",
    "[ fig : strco13 ] ) .",
    "this hexagonal growth of the pure co clusters is quite unusual compared to the trend seen in the clusters of its 3@xmath8 neighbors like mn , fe , ni , which preferably adapt an icosahedral pattern.@xcite further study is needed to explore the unusual structural pattern of small pure co clusters.@xcite another distorted structure of hcp motif with total magnetic moment of 27 @xmath25 and 0.14 ev above the minimum energy state , is the first isomer .",
    "the optimal icosahedral structure of total spin 31 @xmath25 ( structure having 20 triangular faces and 30 edges ) is 0.17 ev higher than the minimum energy state and emerges as the second isomer .",
    "the third isomer is a distorted cub - octahedron with total magnetic moment 25 @xmath25 and it is 0.22 ev above the minimum energy state . the structures of the ground state , second and third isomers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strco13 ] .",
    "it is to be noted that for the pure co@xmath0 cluster , all the atomic moments are ferromagnetically coupled and our predicted magnetic moment of the ground state structure is in good agreement with the experimental value which is 2.0 @xmath25/atom.@xcite    in the case of single v atom doped co@xmath11v clusters , we have again considered the starting geometries of icosahedral , hcp and cub - octahedral symmetries .",
    "however , depending upon the position of the singly doped v - atom either at the center or on the surface , it can give rise to several _",
    "homotops_. again , the surface atoms of a 13-atoms cluster are not equivalent in terms of number of neighbors and their relative positions in case of hcp and cuboctahedral structures , while for icosahedral structure , all the surface atoms are equivalent",
    ". this consideration will give few more starting geometries .",
    "so we have considered all these possible geometrical structures and for each of them , we have considered the _ all possible _ collinear spin alignments during relaxation . upon optimization of geometry and spin degrees of freedom , we find that an icosahedral structure of total magnetic moment 25 @xmath25 , with v atom doped at the center position , is the mes . now there are several interesting points to note in the context of the co@xmath11v cluster .",
    "first of all , the cohesive energy of the mes is considerably higher ( by 1.29 ev ) than that of the pure co@xmath0 clusters , indicating its exceptional stability .",
    "secondly , the v doped co - clusters are found to prefer the icosahedral growth pattern , instead of hcp growth pattern , as we observed in case of the pure co - clusters .",
    "therefore , just the single v - atom doping in co@xmath0 changes the equilibrium structure from hcp to icosahedron .",
    "this hcp to icosahedron structural transition has also been reported previously for mn doping in co@xmath0 cluster.@xcite finally , the single v - atom likes to fit at the center of the icosahedron and it is ferrimagnetically coupled with the surface co - atoms . the first isomer is also a central v - atom doped icosahedral co@xmath11v cluster , with total magnetic moment 23 @xmath25 and it is about 0.46 ev above the mes .",
    "center v doped cub - octahedral co@xmath11v cluster with 23 @xmath25 magnetic moment which has energy 0.70 ev higher than the minimum energy icosahedral structure , is the second isomer .",
    "the third isomer is a center v doped icosahedron with total magnetic moment of 27 @xmath25 .",
    "center v doping in case of hcp cluster is less favorable and appears as the fifth isomer in our calculation with total magnetic moment 25 @xmath25 and energy 0.80 ev above the mes .",
    "we have also considered the optimal structure of co@xmath0 ( distorted hcp ) as the starting structure and substituted the most coordinated central co - atom by a v - atom .",
    "after relaxation considering _ all possible _ spin alignments , it is found that the shape of the optimal structure remains more or less same as that of the optimal hcp co@xmath0 cluster and energetically , it is the fourth isomer with total magnetic moment 23 @xmath25 . the most probable surface v - doping has a cub - octahedral structure with total magnetic moment 21 @xmath25 , but it is about 1.32 ev above the mes .",
    "the structure of ground state and few isomers for the co@xmath11v cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strco12v ] .",
    "because of the icosahedral growth preference of the co@xmath11v cluster and the presence of the singly doped v - atom at the central site , we consider only the icosahedral symmetry based geometries as the starting guess for more than one v atom doped clusters , in which one v atom is always at the center position , while the residual v atoms reside on the surface . for co@xmath26v@xmath3 cluster",
    ", the second v atom can replace any of the surface co atoms , as all the surface sites of a 13-atom icosahedron , are equivalent .",
    "after relaxation for _ all possible _ spin configurations , we find that the mes has total magnetic moment of 19 @xmath25 and total cohesive energy of 43.22 ev .",
    "the first and second isomers have magnetic moments of 21 @xmath25 and 17 @xmath25 and they are 0.10 ev and 0.25 ev above the minimum energy state respectively . in the mes ,",
    "the center v - atom is again ferrimagnetically coupled with the surface co atoms and has much lower local magnetic moment as it was in the case of the co@xmath11v cluster , while the surface v atom has the maximum local magnetic moment and it is also ferrimagnetically coupled with the other surface co atoms .    for co@xmath27v@xmath28 cluster , depending upon the different positions of the two surface v atoms , there are three possible icosahedral structures as shown in fig .",

    "both the central and the surface v - atoms have small values of local magnetic moments in this case .",
    "there are several closely spaced isomers of type @xmath29 icosahedron with magnetic moments of 19 @xmath25 , 13 @xmath25 , 23 @xmath25 and 17 @xmath25 which are just 0.04 ev , 0.08 ev , 0.09 ev and 0.15 ev above the mes .",

    "the most coordinated central site is occupied by a v - atom , while the residual v - atoms sit on the surface .",
    "the surface v - atoms like to be closer to each other to form a group , thereby imparting more distortion to the structure and significantly alter the local surface charge density . the central v - site in the mes of all compositions , is always ferrimagnetically coupled and has lower magnetic moment . on the other hand",
    ", the surface v - atoms can be ferrimagnetically or ferromagnetically coupled with the surface co - atoms and their local magnetic moments can be as low as the central v - site or as high as the surface co - site , depending upon the distribution of surface charge density in the clusters having different amount of v - doping .",
    "our prediction of icosahedral geometry for the minimum energy states of v doped co clusters is in accordance with the speculation of a closed shell geometry around the central site in ref .",
    "13 and ref . 15 .",
    "+ to have more confidence about the structural trend as observed above , we have carried out few _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) study for the co@xmath11v and co@xmath27v@xmath28 clusters . to determine the lowest energy structures , we have heated up the clusters to 2000 k ( which is close to the melting temperature 1768 k for bulk co and 2183 k for bulk v ) .",
    "the clusters have then been maintained at this temperature for at least 6 ps and then allowed to cool again to 0 k. the cooling process has been done for 24 ps and maintained a very slow cooling rate of 1 k per one iteration throughout the process .",
    "the main results obtained from the md run are : ( a ) it prefers to adopt the icosahedral pattern with same magnetic alignment of atoms as we predicted from zero temperature relaxation , ( b ) for the co@xmath11v cluster , the v atom occupies the central position , ( c ) the surface v atoms for the co@xmath27v@xmath28 cluster , prefer to be closest to each other .",
    "these results provide reassurance and more confidence in our zero temperature relaxation .",
    "the observed atomic arrangement of the mes of the co@xmath1v@xmath2 clusters as described in the previous section depends critically on the balance of several parameters like the relative strengths of various kinds of bonds present in a cluster structure , the relative atomic sizes , the amount of charge transfer between two different species of atoms , the energy gap between the homo and the lumo , abundance of states near fermi energy etc .",

    "[ fig : cohesive ] shows the plot of the cohesive energies of the mes of the co@xmath1v@xmath2 clusters with increasing v concentration .",
    "the plot is with respect to the cohesive energy of the mes of co@xmath0 cluster .",
    "it is seen that the binding has increased considerably compared to that of the optimal co@xmath0 cluster with single v atom doping .",
    "however , the cohesive energies decrease sharply for the higher concentration of v - atoms . for the double and triple v - atom doping ,",
    "the cohesive energies are above the dashed line indicating their higher stability compared to the pure co@xmath0 , while for the fourth v - atom doping , the cohesive energy is even lower than that of the pure co@xmath0 .",
    "the relative stability among the clusters of nearby concentrations is more distinct when we plot the second difference in cohesive energies in the inset of fig .",

    "[ d2e ] to calculate the second difference .",
    "a sharp pick in the @xmath35 at @xmath10 1 points to the exceptional stability of the single v - doped cluster compared to the undoped or more than one v - doped clusters .",
    "0.73 cm    in order to understand the stability of the doped clusters , we have calculated the cohesive energies and the bond lengths of the co - co , co - v and v - v dimers as shown in table [ table6.1 ] .",
    "it is seen that the v@xmath3 dimer is the most stable and the bond length of the v@xmath3 dimer is also about 14% shorter than that of the co@xmath3 dimer which has the least binding among the three . on the other hand , the cohesive energy and bond length of the co - v dimer",
    "are intermediate of the co@xmath3 and the v@xmath3 dimers . for the co@xmath11v cluster",
    ", we have seen that the center doping in icosahedral structure is the most favorable .",
    "binary clusters are known to have the problem of segregation , where the doped atom can segregate at the surface or center . to a first approximation",
    ", if one of the homonuclear bonds is the strongest , then that species tends to be at the center of the cluster.@xcite our finding of central v - doping is in accordance with this , as the v@xmath3 dimer has the strongest binding .",
    "the atomic radius of a co - atom and a v - atom , being almost same , the substitution of the central co atom in an icosahedral co@xmath0 cluster by a v atom leaves the structure almost unperturbed . as for evidence , the center to vertex average distance and the average distance between two nearby vertices in the optimal icosahedral structure of the co@xmath0 cluster are 2.334  and 2.450  . for the optimal co@xmath11v cluster ,",
    "these values are almost same , 2.344 and 2.465  respectively . therefore the large gain in cohesive energy of the co@xmath11v cluster over that of the co@xmath0 cluster",
    "may be due to the enhanced cohesive energy of the cov dimer over that of the co@xmath3 dimer , though an atom in a dimer is quite different from an atom at the center of a 13-atom cluster .",

    "[ chemisorp ] shows our calculated lowest energy chemisorption structures after h@xmath3 absorbsion for clusters of all compositions .",
    "first thing to notice is that h@xmath3 molecule chemisorbs dissociatively in each case , _",
    "i.e _ the distance between the two h - atoms in the chemisorption structures is much larger than the h - h bond length of an isolated h@xmath3 molecule .",
    "the chemisorption gives rise to moderate perturbation to the structures and makes them more symmetric ( _ i.e _ surface bonds are now less dispersive ) compared to the parent structure without hydrogen .",
    "there are three possible ways for the h - atoms to be adsorbed on each cluster : on top of an atom ( one fold ) , at a bridge position between two atoms ( two fold ) and at the hollow site of a triangular plane on the cluster ( three fold ) .",
    "again , as the surface contains two species of atoms for co@xmath26v@xmath3 , co@xmath27v@xmath28 and co@xmath32v@xmath33 , then the one fold position can be on top of a surface v - atom or on top of a surface co - atom .",
    "two fold position can be the top of a v - v bond , co - v bond or a co - co bond which can be nearer to or away from the v - site .",
    "similarly , in triangular plane , there are several possibilities : ( @xmath36 ) all the three atoms can be v - atoms ( only possible for co@xmath32v@xmath33 ) , ( @xmath37 ) one co atom and two v - atoms , ( @xmath38 ) two co - atoms and one v - atom , and ( @xmath39 ) all three are co - atoms . we have considered all these possible combinations during optimization .",
    "it is , however , seen that in each of the optimized structures , h - atoms absorb at the hollow site on the surface and for m @xmath40 2 , they prefer the association of the local v atom .",
    "for example in the co@xmath32v@xmath33h@xmath3 cluster , one h - atom absorbs at the hollow site of v - v - v triangular plane and the other h atom on top of a v - v - co triangular plane . for co@xmath26v@xmath3h@xmath3",
    ", the h - atoms appear to absorb at the bridge positions , but they are inclined with an angle such that the absorption tends toward a three fold configuration .",
    "the preference of more coordinated hollow site is likely due to geometric arrangements .",
    "it allows the h - atom to interact more with the v or co atoms . on the other hand ,",
    "the v - site preference of h - atom is due to the formation of stronger @xmath15-@xmath8 bond with v - atom compared to that with co - atom .",
    "0.6 cm    the higher reactivity of the co@xmath0 cluster compared to the co@xmath11v cluster , while both of them have the same twelve co - atoms on the surface , can be understood from charge transfer analysis .",
    "we have computed the charge enclosed within a sphere around each surface atom of the optimal structures of co@xmath0h@xmath3 and co@xmath11vh@xmath3 clusters .",
    "it is seen that the amount of charge on the surface co - atoms in the co@xmath0h@xmath3 cluster is larger by about 0.2 ( in unit of electronic charge ) than that of co@xmath11vh@xmath3 and it is mainly contributed by the @xmath8-electrons of surface co atoms",
    ". therefore stronger 3@xmath8 - 1@xmath15 interaction between surface co - atoms and chemisorbed h - atoms in case of co@xmath0h@xmath3 increases its reactivity .",
    "this result is in accordance with that of fujima _ et al _ @xcite who also predicted the stronger interaction between 1@xmath15 of h atom and the 3@xmath8 orbital of the surface co atom in the co@xmath0h@xmath3 cluster compared to that in the co@xmath11vh@xmath3 cluster using density of state analysis .",
    "they showed that the anti - bonding orbital component between the h-1@xmath15 electron and the 3@xmath8 electron of the surface co - atoms shifts further away above the homo in case of co@xmath0h@xmath3 compared to that of co@xmath11vh@xmath3 , while the bonding orbital components for both the clusters stay almost at the same energy position below the homo . extending the charge transfer analysis for the co@xmath1v@xmath2h@xmath3 clusters with @xmath7 = 2,3 and 4",
    ", we find that the average charge per surface v - atom is gradually increasing with the increase of v - concentration which indicates the formation of stronger v - h bonds at the surface with increasing v - doping .",

    "the source of this chemisorption energy is the cluster rearrangement energy ( _ i.e _ the energy change due to the geometrical rearrangement of the cluster upon chemisorption ) and the efficient cluster - absorbate bonding in presence of v due to more efficient @xmath15-@xmath8 hybridization .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the geometric and electronic structures of v doped co@xmath0 clusters and their chemisorption towards hydrogen molecules using first principles density functional calculation .",
    "the lowest energy structures of all compositions prefer to have icosahedral geometry , unlike hexagonal symmetry preference of the pure co clusters . for the co@xmath11v cluster ,",
    "the single v atom prefers to sit at the central site , thereby guarded by all the surface co atoms and can not participate directly in the chemisorption reaction .",
    "consequently reactivity of co@xmath11v becomes very less . on the other hand , for more than one v atom doping",
    ", the additional v - atoms reside on the surface and come in direct contact with chemisorbed h - atom and reactivity increases .",
    "our calculated spin gaps , density of states and charge transfer analysis explain nicely the stability of clusters and their tendency towards chemisorption . in the chemisorbed structures ,",
