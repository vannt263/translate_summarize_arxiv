    "[ sec : intro ]    massive stars are known to be rapid rotators with typical equatorial velocities around 200@xmath2or more during hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that this much rotation could have a significant influence on the evolution of the star , both on the main sequence and during in its later stages of evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , on the main sequence , surface abundance patterns are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) that are most naturally explained by rotationally - induced mixing in the stellar interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerical studies of of the later evolutionary stages of rotating massive stars initially found that the stellar core would reach critical ( keplerian ) rotation by the time carbon ignited in the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially when angular momentum transport is neglected .",
    "thus one might encounter triaxial deformation early on , with continued evolution hovering near instability .",
    "modern stellar models that include more instabilities capable of transporting angular momentum find that considerable angular momentum is lost from the core during hydrogen and helium burning @xcite , especially when the stabilizing effect of composition gradients is reduced @xcite .",
    "such stars now evolve to iron core collapse , but still form very rapidly rotating ( @xmath3 ) neutron stars .    however , with the exception of @xcite and @xcite , all studies of massive stellar evolution to date have ignored what is probably a major effect , the torques exerted in differentially rotating regions by the magnetic fields that thread them .",
    "this omission has not been because such torques were thought to be unimportant , but because of the complexity and uncertainty of carrying out even one - dimensional calculations that included them .",
    "this uncertainty , in turn , related to the absence of a credible physical theory that would even qualitatively describe the separate evolution of the radial and poloidal components of the field , both of which are necessary to calculate the torque , @xmath4    @xcite estimated these torques assuming that the poloidal field results from differential winding and that the radial field would , due to the action of unspecified instabilities , be comparable .",
    "particular attention was paid to the region of large shear that separates the core of helium and heavy elements from the very slowly rotating hydrogen envelope of a red supergiant star .",
    "this assumption , @xmath5 , probably overestimated the actual @xmath6 by orders of magnitude and the rotation rates that @xcite estimated for young pulsars were thus too slow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite has provided improved estimates for @xmath6 and @xmath7 based upon a dynamo process that takes into account the effect of stable stratifications . here",
    "we investigate the effect of this prescription in a stellar evolution code used to study the complete evolution of massive stars .",
    "particular attention is given to the rotation rate it implies for young neutron stars . in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] , we describe the physical and numerical modeling . in  [ sec : result ] , the results for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 stars are presented and , in  [",

    "typical neutron star rotation rates , at birth , are @xmath13 @xmath1 . in  [ sec : brake ] we discuss other possible ways that such rapidly rotating stars might be slowed during the first days of their evolution by magnetic winds and fall back .",
    "the surface abundance changes due to rotationally - induced mixing are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : abundances ] and in  [ sec : conclude ] we give our conclusions .",
    "[ sec : phys ]    the treatment of magnetic torques given by @xcite was implemented in a version of the implicit hydrodynamics stellar evolution code ( kepler , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that already included angular momentum transport and mixing due to a number of non - magnetic processes .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of these non - magnetic instabilities and @xcite for a detailed description of the dynamo mechanism . here",
    "we discuss only the implementation of and results from that physical model .    both angular momentum transport and chemical mixing",
    "are calculated by solving the time - dependent diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the dynamo adjusts and reaches equilibrium field strength on a time - scale that is short compared to the evolution time - scales of the star , i.e. , we neglect the time required to reach the steady state field strength and distribution described by @xcite and only apply their equilibrium values .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation in all but the most advanced burning stages that occur when the angular momentum distribution has already been frozen in .",
    "the validity of this assumption is revisited in  [ sec : conclude ]      @xcite discusses two limiting cases : stabilization by composition gradients ( spruit s case 0 ) , and stabilization by superadiabatic temperature gradients ( spruit s case 1 ) .",
    "realistic stellar models exhibit both kinds of gradients at same time , so the intermediate case must also be included ( see also @xcite ) .    the effective viscosity , @xmath14 , for the radial transport of angular momentum results from azimuthal stress due to the field generated by the dynamo , @xmath15 . its value is given by @xmath16",
    "see also eqs .",

    "the compositional contribution to the bruntvsl frequency is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 obey their common definitions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "again , the derivatives are the actual gradients in the star , not thermodynamic derivatives .",
    "the thermal contribution to the bruntvsl frequency is then given by @xmath34 as stated above , we use the symbol @xmath35 to indicate ( the square of ) the bruntvsl frequency due to the composition gradient for a general equation of state ( @xmath36 ) , not just due to changes of mean molecular weight , @xmath37 .",
    "appendices  [ sec : adi ] and [ sec : brunt ] give a derivation of the general expressions .",
    "this formulation is identical with the stability analysis for the different regimes ( next section ) as used in kepler , and therefore necessary for consistency in regimes where the assumption of an ideal gas is a poor approximation .",
    "in addition to the radiative regime , * i * , where both composition gradients and temperature gradients are stabilizing , other regimes have to be considered in which `` secular '' mixing processes operate .",
    "these are secular as opposed to processes like convection that operate on a hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "two of these are semiconvection ( * ii * ; where a stabilizing composition gradient dominates a destabilizing temperature gradient ) and thermohaline convection , also called the salt - finger instability ( * iii * ; where a stabilizing temperature gradient dominates a destabilizing composition gradient ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  1 for an overview ) .",
    "the final regime of hydrodynamic instability in non - rotating stars is that of ledoux convection ( @xcite ; regime  * iv * ; wehere the destabilizing temperature gradient is stronger than any stabilization by the composition gradient ) . in the ledoux regime , effective viscosities and diffusivities",
    "are given by mixing length theory @xcite .",
    "a very approximate treatment of regimes * ii * and * iii * is given in the next two sections .",
    "[ sec : sc ]    in semiconvective regions ( regime  * ii * ) , the square of the thermal buoyancy frequency is negative and thus the limiting case * 1 * would be convection . instead of equation ( 34 ) of @xcite , we first compute an `` dynamo '' effective viscosity by @xmath38 with @xmath39from equation ( 35 ) of @xcite and @xmath40 ( equations 37 - 39 of @xcite ) .    adopting a model for semiconvection in the non - linear regime",
    "similar to @xcite , we assume the radiative flux is transported by convective motions in the semiconvective layers .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we compute an effective turbulent viscosity , @xmath41 , from the velocities according to mixing - length theory @xcite assuming schwarzschild convection ( i.e. , when the @xmath37 gradient is neglected ) , @xmath42 ( e.g. , as derived from equations 7.6 and 7.7 of * ? ? ? * ) and an assumed characteristic length scale of @xmath43by @xmath44 ( however , see * ? ? ? * ) , and @xmath45is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure .",
    "finally , we assume that the actual viscosity is somewhere between that of the case of mere semiconvection and that of the dynamo dominated by composition stratification and take the geometric mean between the two viscosities , @xmath46 the effective turbulent diffusion coefficient , @xmath47 , is computed in an analogous way , @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath40 . due to the properties of the layers semiconvection model @xcite  negligible diffusivity in typical stellar environments  , we do not compute a geometric mean with the semiconvective diffusivity similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nusc ] ) .",
    "instead we just add it to the semiconvective diffusion coefficient computed in kepler .",
    "typically it is negligible .",
    "[ sec : th ]    in this regime ( * iii * ) the compositional buoyancy frequency becomes negative and the limiting case * 0 * would be rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "we assume the limiting case * 1 * of @xcite and compute @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , analogous to the semiconvective case .    in massive stars ,",
    "thermohaline convection typically occurs following radiative shell burning in the fuel `` trace '' left behind by an receding central convective burning phase .",
    "the higher temperature of shell burning can sometimes create heavier ashes than core burning and the resulting compositional structure is unstable .",
    "the contraction phase after central helium burning is the most important domain in massive stars .    generally , the motions associated with the growth of this instability ( `` salt fingers '' ) are very slow .",
    "thus the interaction with the dynamo is much more restricted than in the case of semiconvection .",
    "therefore we do _ not _ employ a interpolation between the dynamo effective radial viscosity or diffusivity as is done in ",

    "[ sec : result ]      based upon the assumptions in  [ sec : phys ] , the full evolution of stars of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 of solar metallicity was calculated . for comparison ,",
    "equivalent models were also calculated without magnetic fields for three of these stars .",
    "the initial models and input physics were the same as in @xcite , but the total angular momentum of the star was chsen such that a typical initial equatorial rotation velocity of @xmath56 @xcite was reached on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ; see @xcite ) .",
    "time - dependent mixing and angular momentum transport were followed as discussed by @xcite with the turbulent viscosities and diffusivities from the dynamo model added to those from the model for the hydrodynamic instabilities . for the time being ,",
    "possible interactions between the two are neglected ( though see @xcite ) . our standard case ( * b * ) implements the description as outlined in the previous sections .",

    "[ fig : bfig ] _ _ summarize our principal results . as also noted by @xcite , the inclusion of magnetic torques with a magnitude given by @xcite ,",
    "greatly decreases the differential rotation of the star leading to more slowly rotating cores .    for illustration , we consider in some detail the evolution of the @xmath0 model with standard parameter settings .",
    "table  [ tab:15evo ] shows that , over the course of the entire evolution , the total angular momentum enclosed by fiducial spheres of mass coordinate @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 decreases in the magnetic models by a factor of 100 to 200 , far more than in the non - magnetic comparison model . in both cases most of the angular momentum transport occurs prior to carbon ignition ( figs .",
    "[ fig : jfig15 ] _ _ and [ fig : jfig25 ] _ _ ) .",
    "the greatest fractional decrease occurs during the transition from hydrogen depletion to helium ignition ( table  [ tab:15evo ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : jfig15 ] _ _ ) as the star adjusts to its new red giant structure . during this transition",
    ", the central density goes up by a factor of about 100 ( from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) with an accompanying increase in differential rotation and shear .",
    "though the angular momentum evolves little after carbon burning , modified only by local shells of convection , there is a factor of two change after carbon ignition ( central temperature = @xmath62 ) .",
    "the magnetic torques are sufficiently strong to enforce rigid rotation both on the main sequence and in the helium core during helium burning for all masses considered ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the appreciable braking that occurs during hydrogen and helium burning is therefore a consequence of mass loss and evolving stellar structure , especially the formation of a slowly rotating hydrogen envelope around a rapidly rotating helium core .",
    "typically the more massive stars spend a shorter time during the critical kelvin - helmholtz contraction between hydrogen depletion and helium ignition and also have a shorter helium burning lifetime . hence , even though they actually have a little _ less _ angular momentum at the fiducial mass points in table  [ tab:15evo ] on the main sequence , the more massive stars have _ more _ angular momentum in their cores at the end of helium burning .",
    "this distinction persists and the more massive stars give birth to more rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "stars that include all the usual non - magnetic mechanisms for rotational mixing and angular momentum transport @xcite , but which lack magnetic fields have a considerably different evolution and end up with 30 to 50 times more angular momentum in that part of their core destined to collapse to a neutron star ( tables  [ tab:15evo ] and [ tab : psr ] , figs .",
    "[ fig : jfig15 ] _ _ and [ fig : jfig25 ] _ _ ) .",
    "most notable is the lack of appreciable braking of the helium core by the outer layers in the period between hydrogen core depletion and helium ignition .",
    "the post - carbon - ignition braking that accounted for an additional factor of two in the magnetic case is also much weaker .",
    "in fact , the inner @xmath63 of the @xmath0 model has only about five times less angular momentum at core collapse than implied by strict conservation from the ( rigidly rotating ) main sequence onwards .",
    "as noted previously many times , such a large amount of angular momentum would have important consequences for the supernova explosion mechanism . rigidly rotating neutron stars",
    "can not have a period shorter than about @xmath64 .",
    "table  [ tab:15b ] gives the magnetic field components that exist in different parts of the star during different evolutionary phases .",
    "the magnetic field is highly variable from location to location in the star and the values given are representative , but not accurate to better than a factor of a few ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bfig ] _",
    "_ ) , especially during the late stages . as expected , the toroidal field , which comes from differential winding is orders of magnitude larger than the radial field generated by the tayler instability .",
    "the product @xmath65scales very approximately as the central density with the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "though the formulae used here are expected to break down during core collapse , a simple extrapolation to @xmath67 for the central density of a neutron star suggests @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "table  [ tab : psr ] gives the expected pulsar rotation rates based upon a set of standard assumptions .",
    "following @xcite , it is assumed that all neutron stars ( with realistic masses ) have a radius of @xmath70 and a moment of inertia @xmath71 .",
    "adding the binding energy to the gravitational mass , assumed in table  [ tab : psr ] to be @xmath72 gives the baryonic mass of the core that collapsed to the neutron star , @xmath73 .",
    "taking the angular momentum inside @xmath73 from the presupernova model , assuming conservation during collapse , and solving for the period then gives the values in the table .",
    "it is expected that our results will be sensitive to several uncertain factors including the effect of composition gradients , the efficiency of the dynamo in generating magnetic field , and the initial angular momentum of the star .",
    "to some extent , these uncertainties are ameliorated by the strong sensitivity of the expected magnetic torques to rotation speed and differential shear ( eq .  3436 of @xcite ) .",
    "composition gradients have very significant influence on the resulting angular momentum transport by inhibiting the action of the dynamo .",
    "in particular , composition interfaces , as resulting from the nuclear burning processes in combination with convection , usually also show significant shear , but if the dynamo action is suppressed by a steep change in mean molecular weight , angular momentum can become `` trapped '' in a fashion similar to that observed by @xcite . to illustrate the uncertainties of the dynamo model",
    ", we studied several test cases where the stabilizing effect of composition gradients is varied by multiplying @xmath23and @xmath74by 1/10 .",
    "we also explored multiplying the overall coefficient of the torque in eq .",
    "( 1 ) by varying @xmath65by a factor of ten and multiplied the initial rotational rate by 0.5 and 1.5 ( table  [ tab : psr ] ) .    in three cases , the @xmath10 and @xmath75 with high rotation rate , and the `` normal '' @xmath12 model , the star lost its hydrogen - rich envelope due to mass loss either during ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) or just at the end ( @xmath76 ) of it evolution .",
    "the kepler code was not able to smoothly run these models through the period where they lost their last solar mass of envelope because violent pulsations were encountered .",
    "the last 0.5 to @xmath77 was thus removed abruptly and the calculation continued for the resulting wolf - rayet star .",
    "however , it is clear that removing the envelope removes an appreciable braking torque on the helium core so it is reasonable that the remnants of such stars rotate more rapidly .",
    "since the iron core masses , silicon shell masses , and density profiles all differ appreciably for presupernova stars in the 12 to @xmath12 range , it is not realistic to assume that they all make neutron stars of the same mass .",
    "ideally , one would extract realistic masses from a reliable , credible model for the explosion , but , unfortunately , such models have not reached the point of making accurate predictions .",
    "still there are some general features of existing models that provide some guidance .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the remnant mass can not typically be less than the mass of the neutronized iron core .",
    "otherwise one overproduces rare neutron - rich isotopes of the iron group . more important to the present discussion ,",
    "successful explosions , when they occur in modern codes , typically give `` mass cuts '' in the vicinity of large entropy jumps .",
    "the reason is that a jump in the entropy corresponds to sudden decrease in the density .",
    "this in turn implies a sudden fall off in accretion as the explosion develops .",
    "the lower density material is also more loosely bound by gravity .",
    "the largest jump in the vicinity of the iron core is typically at the base of the oxygen burning shell and that has sometimes been used to estimate neutron star masses @xcite .",
    "recent studies by thomas janka ( private communication ) suggest a numerical criterion , that the mass cut occurs where the entropy per baryon equals @xmath78 . in table",
    "[ tab : psr(m ) ] , instead of assuming a constant baryonic mass of @xmath73 for the neutron star progenitor ( as in table  [ tab : psr ] ) , we take the value where the specific entropy is @xmath79 .    as expected this prescription gives larger baryonic masses for the remnant ( `` baryon '' in the table ) .",
    "the fraction of this mass that is carried away by neutrinos is given by @xcite , @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "when this is subtracted , one obtains the gravitational masses , @xmath82 in table  [ tab : psr(m ) ] . using these , assuming once more a moment of inertia @xmath83 and a radius of @xmath70 , and conserving angular momentum in the collapse one obtains the period .",
    "because the angular momentum per unit mass increases as one goes out in the star , using a larger mass for the remnant increases its rotation rate .",
    "the resulting values are similar to those in table  [ tab : psr ] for the same `` standard '' parameter settings , but show even more clearly the tendency of larger stars to make more rapidly rotating pulsars .",
    "they also show an additional prediction of the model - that more massive pulsars will rotate more rapidly .",
    "the numbers in table  [ tab : psr(m ) ] have not been corrected for the fact that the typical neutrino , since it last interacts at the edge of the neutron star , carries away more angular momentum than the average for its equivalent mass .",
    "thus the periods in table  [ tab : psr(m ) ] can probably be multiplied by an additional factor of @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "[ sec : obs ]    table  [ tab : psr - obs ] gives the measured and estimated rotation rates and angular momenta of several young pulsars at birth @xcite . to estimate the angular momenta in the table , we have assumed , following @xcite , that the moment of inertia for ordinary neutron stars ( not quark stars ) is @xmath85 . here a constant fiducial gravitational mass of @xmath72 is assumed .",
    "given the uncertainties in both our model and the extrapolation of observed pulsar properties , the agreement , at least for the 12 - @xmath0 models , is quite encouraging .",
    "this true all the more so when one realizes that the periods in tables  [ tab : psr ] and [ tab : psr(m ) ] should be multiplied by a factor of approximately @xmath86 to account for the angular momentum carried away by neutrinos when the neutron star forms @xcite .",
    "then our standard , numerically typical supernova , @xmath0 , would produce a neutron star with angular momentum @xmath87 ( `` presn '' entry in table  [ tab:15evo ] divided by 1.3 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the most common core collapse events - by number - will be in the @xmath8 to @xmath76 range because of the declining initial mass function .",
    "moreover , stars above around @xmath11 - @xmath88 may end up making black holes @xcite .",
    "what then is the observational situation ?",
    "@xcite have discovered a pulsar in the crab - like supernova remnant , n157b , in the large magellanic cloud , with a rotation rate of @xmath89 .",
    "this is probably an upper bound to its rotation rate at birth .",
    "@xcite gives an estimated initial rotation rate for the crab pulsar itself of @xmath90 .",
    "estimating the initial rotation rate of the much larger sample of pulsars , known to be rotating now much more slowly , is fraught with uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , psr 0531 + 21 and psr 1509 - 58 are also estimated to have been born with @xmath91 periods @xcite ( though 0540 - 69 is estimated to have @xmath92 ) . at the other extreme ,",
    "@xcite find for pks1209 - 51/52 a rotation period of @xmath93 and argue that the initial rate was not much greater .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that the initial rotation rate of psr j0538 + 2817 was @xmath94 .",
    "[ sec : brake ]      for some time it was thought that gravitational radiation induced by the `` _ _ r__-mode instability '' would rapidly brake young neutron stars .",
    "however , @xcite found that the _ r_-mode waves saturate at amplitudes lower than obtained in previous numerical calculations @xcite that assumed an unrealistically large driving force .",
    "much less gravitational radiation occurs and the braking time for a rapidly rotating neutron star becomes millennia rather than hours .",
    "@xcite calculate that @xmath95 with @xmath96 , the maximum amplitude of the instability ( for which @xcite estimate 0.1 as an upper bound ) .",
    "a @xmath97 pulsar will thus take about 2000 years to substantially brake and the more slowly rotating neutron stars in tables  [ tab : psr ] and [ tab : psr(m ) ] will take even longer .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have discussed the possibility that a young , rapidly rotating neutron star will be braked by a magnetic stellar wind .",
    "this wind , powered by the neutrino emission of the supernova , may also be an important site for @xmath20-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .    during the first @xmath98 of its life a neutron star emits about @xmath99 of its mass as neutrinos .",
    "this powerful flux of neutrinos passing through the proto - neutron star atmosphere drives mass loss and the neutron star loses @xmath100 @xcite .",

    "it should also be kept in mind that the field strength of a neutron star when it is @xmath129 - @xmath98 old could be very different than thousands of years later when most measurements have been made .",

    "just how this would all play out in a multi - dimensional calculation that includes magnetic braking , rotation , and a declining accretion rate has yet to be determined , but is worth some thought .",
    "if the accreting matter is actually expelled under ` propeller ' conditions , one might expect that the mechanism also inhibits the accretion so the process might be self - limiting .",

    "is expected to occur ( @xcite ; for a recent discussion see @xcite ) , as observed in the x - ray pulsars .",
    "if fall back is the way most neutron stars are slowed , one might expect a correlation of pulsar period with the amount of mass that falls back and that might increase with progenitor mass .",
    "more massive stars may experience more fall back @xcite and make slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "but , on the other hand , as tables  [ tab : psr ] and [ tab : psr(m ) ] show , neutron stars derived from more massive stars are born rotating more rapidly .",
    "there may be a mass around @xmath0 or so where the two effects combine to give the slowest rotation rate .",
    "interestingly , the crab pulsar was probably once a star of @xmath159 @xcite and may thus have experienced very little fall back .",
    "the matter that is ejected by the propeller mechanism in more massive stars could contribute appreciably to the explosion of the supernova and especially its mixing .      as noted above",

    "another possibility is that their main sequence progenitors started with a qualitatively different magnetic field configuration .",
    "the dynamo process envisaged here assumes that the initial field of the star was sufficiently weak , such that winding - up by differential rotation produces the predominantly toroidal field in which the dynamo process operates .",
    "any weak large scale field initially present is then expelled by turbulent diffusion associated with the dynamo .",
    "stars with strong initial fields , such as seen in the magnetic a - stars , can not have followed this path . in these stars ,",
    "the magnetic field is likely to have eliminated any initial differential rotation of the star on a short time scale @xcite , after which it relaxed to the observed stable configurations @xcite . in these configurations the radial and azimuthal field components are of similar magnitude . to the extent that such magnetic fields also exist in massive ms stars ( where they are much harder to detect , see however @xcite )",
    ", they are likely to have led to a stronger magnetic coupling between core and envelope , and hence to more slowly rotating pre - sn cores .",
    "[ sec : abundances ]    the abundances of certain key isotopes and elements on the surfaces of main sequence stars and evolved supergiants are known to be diagnostics of rotationally - induced mixing @xcite . in particular , on the main sequence , one expects enhancements of 4he , c , n , o , and @xmath160 and extra depletion of c , n , o , o , f , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 . to test these predictions and their sensitivity to assumed magnetic torques in the present models , we calculated three additional versions of our @xmath0 model in which a large nuclear reaction network was carried in each zone .",
    "the adopted nuclear physics and network were essentially the same as in @xcite .",
    "one model assumed no rotation ; a second assumed rotation without magnetic torques ; and a third , which included both rotation and magnetic torques , was our standard model in tables  [ tab:15evo ] - [ tab : psr(m ) ] .",
    "the initial rotation rate assumed in the magnetic and non - magnetic models was the same .",
    "the results ( table  [ tab : xsurf ] ) show the same sort of rotationally - induced enhancements and depletions on the main sequence ( defined by half - hydrogen depletion at the center ) as in @xcite .",
    "helium is up by about half a percent and nitrogen is increased by two .",
    "carbon is depleted by about @xmath164 and n is depleted by a factor of two .",
    "the isotopes c and o are enhanced by factors of three and @xmath165 respectively . @xmath162 and @xmath163 are depleted .",
    "most important to the current discussion , we see no dramatic differences between the surface abundances calculated with and without magnetic torques .",
    "@xcite suggested that such differences might be a discriminant , perhaps ruling out torques of the magnitude suggested by @xcite .",
    "[ sec : conclude ]    given the uncertainty that must accompany any first - principles estimate of magnetic field generation in the interior of stars , the rotation rates , we derive here compare quite favorably with those inferred for a number of the more rapidly rotating pulsars . without invoking any additional braking during or after the supernova explosion , the most common pulsars , which come from stars of @xmath166 - @xmath0 , will have rotation rates around @xmath166 - @xmath1 ( table  [ tab : psr ] ) .",
    "reasonable variation in uncertain parameters could easily increase this to @xmath167 .",
    "given that the torques in the formalism of @xcite depend upon the fourth power of the shear between layers , this answer is robust to small changes in the overall coupling efficiency and inhibition factors .",
    "if we accept the premise that only the fastest solitary pulsars represent their true birth properties and the others have been slowed by fall back or other processes occurring during the first few years of evolution , our predictions are in agreement with observations .",
    "if correct , this conclusion will have important implications , not only for the evolution of pulsars , but for the supernova explosion mechanism , gravitational wave generation , and for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . for rotation rates more rapid than @xmath168 , centrifugal forces are an important ingredient in modeling the collapse and the kinetic energy available from rotation is more than the @xmath169 customarily attributed to supernovae . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the energy is nearly negligible .    given recent observational indications that supernovae accompany some if not all grbs of the `` long - soft '' variety ( e.g. , @xcite ) , rotation is apparently important in at least _ some _ explosions .",
    "otherwise no relativistic jet would form . indeed , the only possibilities are a pulsar with very strong magnetic field and rotation rate @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a rapidly rotating black hole with an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "both require angular momenta considerably in excess of any model is table  [ tab : psr ] except those that did not include magnetic torques .",
    "we shall address this subject in a subsequent paper , but for now note a possible important symmetry braking condition - the presence of a red supergiant envelope .",
    "the most common supernovae - type iip - will result from stars that spent an extended evolutionary period with a rapidly rotating helium core inside a nearly stationary hydrogen envelope .",
    "grbs on the other hand come from type ic supernovae , the explosions of stars that lost their envelopes either to winds or binary companions .",
    "whether a comprehensive model can be developed within the current framework that accommodates both a slow rotation rate for pulsars at birth and a rapid one for grbs remains to be seen but we are hopeful .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] , the magnetic torques have been computed assuming that the dynamo process is always close to steady state . the time to reach this steady state scales as some small multiple of the time for an alfvn wave to travel around the star along the toroidal field .",
    "this time is very short throughout most of the evolution , but in the latest stages it eventually becomes longer than the time scale on which the moment of inertia of the core changes . after this , the dynamo effectively stops tracking the changing conditions and the field is frozen in ( its components varying as @xmath171 , for homologous contraction ) . with the data in tables  [ tab:15evo ] and [ tab:15b ] , we can estimate the effect this would have on the angular momentum loss from the core . the alfvn crossing time first exceeds the evolution time around the end of carbon burning . evolving",
    "the field under frozen - in conditions from this time on then turns out to produce field strengths that do not differ greatly ( less than a factor of 4 ) from those shown in table  [ tab:15b ] . since the angular momentum of the core does not change by more than @xmath172 after carbon burning , the effect of using frozen field conditions instead of a steady dynamo is therefore small .",
