    "we denote its _",
    "norm_. if @xmath56 and @xmath60 are both square - integrable , then @xmath64 exists . for @xmath65",
    "we define the _ fourier coefficient _ @xmath66 . here , @xmath67 denotes the standard inner product on  @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the support of @xmath68 is a discrete set , namely it lies in the dual lattice of the period lattice of  @xmath56 , scaled by  @xmath69 .",
    "if we let @xmath70 for a vector @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "for square - integrable , periodic functions @xmath56 and @xmath60 _ parseval s formula _ @xmath73 holds . by writing the latter sum we mean that we sum over the intersection of the supports of @xmath68 and @xmath74",

    "we can assume that @xmath75 is a periodic function ; in this case we say that @xmath5 is _",
    "periodic_.    indeed , from any measurable set @xmath5 which avoids distances @xmath3 ,  ,  @xmath4 we can construct a periodic set which avoids distances @xmath3 ,  ,  @xmath4 and with upper density arbitrarily close to the one of @xmath5 . to do this we intersect @xmath5 with a regular cube of side",
    "@xmath10 so that @xmath77^n)/\\operatorname{vol}[-t , t]^n$ ] is close to the upper density @xmath78 and so that @xmath79^n)/\\operatorname{vol}[-t , t]^n$ ] , with @xmath80 , differs from @xmath23 only negligibly",

    "by @xmath84 we denote the translation of the set @xmath5 by the vector @xmath85 so that its characteristic function satisfies @xmath86 .",
    "the following two properties are crucial : @xmath87 in particular , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all vectors @xmath90 of euclidean norm @xmath3 ,  ,  @xmath4 .",
    "notice  @xmath91 . by applying parseval s formula to",

    "( or _ two - point correlation function _ ) of @xmath75 . by taking spherical averages we construct from it a radial function @xmath56 whose values only depend on the norm of the vectors . in other words",

    "so the following linear program in the variables @xmath103 gives an upper bound for the upper density of any measurable set which avoids the distances @xmath3 , ",
    ",  @xmath4 : @xmath109 above , all but a countable subset of the  @xmath103 s are zero .",
    "note moreover that we used the normalization @xmath110 .",
    "this linear program has infinitely many variables  @xmath103 but only @xmath111 equality constraints .",
    "a dual of it is @xmath112 which has @xmath111 variables @xmath113 and infinitely many constraints .",
    "as usual , weak duality holds between the pair of linear programs and : if @xmath103 satisfies the conditions in and if @xmath114 satisfies the conditions in , then @xmath115 which finishes the proof of our main theorem .",
    "it is notable that the linear programming bounds for the extreme density of sets avoiding exactly one distance allow for an analytic optimal solution .",
    "since this problem is scaling invariant we can assume that we consider sets avoiding the unit distance @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 be the @xmath118-th positive zero of the bessel function @xmath119 .",
    "it is known that the absolute minimum of the function @xmath12 is attained at  @xmath120 ( see askey , andrews , roy  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 4.6.2 ) ) , and watson  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 15 ,  31 ) ) .",
    "so , the point @xmath121 which is determined by the equations @xmath122 provides the optimal solution for the linear program in theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "hence , @xmath123 and this gives by a lower bound for the measurable chromatic number , namely @xmath124 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this lower bound coincides with the one provided by bachoc , nebe , oliveira , and vallentin  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 8.2 ) , albeit by a shift of one dimension .",
    "this shift of one dimension is due to the fact that bachoc , nebe , oliveira , and vallentin  @xcite study the problem of sets avoiding one distance on the @xmath125-dimensional unit sphere @xmath126 and the lower bound for the measurable chromatic number @xmath24 was obtained by upper bounding the density of sets in the unit sphere which avoid the distance @xmath44 where @xmath44 goes to zero .",
    "so , we see now that this limit process gives a lower bound for the measurable chromatic number of @xmath127 and not only for the one of @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible to strengthen the main theorem and the resulting bound by introducing extra inequalities . consider a regular simplex in @xmath0 with edge length @xmath23 having vertices @xmath128 .",
    "a set @xmath7 which avoids the unit distance can only contain one vertex of this regular simplex .",
    "so we have for the autocorrelation function @xmath129 of the characteristic function @xmath75 defined in   that @xmath130    let  @xmath131 be the _ @xmath6-dimensional orthogonal group _ , that is , the set of all @xmath132 real matrices  @xmath133 such that @xmath134 .",
    "let  @xmath135 denote the haar measure over  @xmath131 normalized by @xmath136 .",
    "taking spherical averages of  @xmath129 is the same as symmetrizing  @xmath129 with respect to the orthogonal group , i.e. , for all  @xmath71 , @xmath137 ( this follows , e.g. , from theorem  3.7 in the book by mattila  @xcite ) .",
    "let  @xmath56 be , as above , the radial function obtained by the symmetrization of  @xmath129 .",
    "for a nonnegative real number  @xmath106 , we write  @xmath138 for the common value of  @xmath56 for vectors of length  @xmath106 .",
    "then , by symmetrizing both sides of   with respect to the orthogonal group , and since distances are preserved by the action of  @xmath131 , we conclude that the inequality @xmath139 can be used to strengthen our original linear program . here , observe that we already took into account the normalization  @xmath140 , introduced in  .",
    "if we center a regular simplex at the origin , the above inequality specializes to @xmath141 which gives the following strengthening of the dual formulation @xmath142 in table  [ table : thenewtable ] we give the new upper bounds on @xmath143 we get for @xmath144 by solving the linear program on a computer ( we discuss numerical issues at the end of this section ) which are improvements over the values which szkely and wormald give in @xcite .",
    "this in turn gives new lower bounds for the measurable chromatic number for @xmath144 .",

    ", we replace the regular triangle centered at the origin by more triangles .",
    "we use the following three triples of squared norms @xmath148 for : @xmath149 , @xmath150 @xmath151 , where the last coordinate of @xmath152 is a root of @xmath153 .",
    "this condition assures that the determinant of the positive semidefinite gram matrix @xmath154 of the points @xmath155 of a corresponding regular simplex vanishes . solving the corresponding linear program yields the new upper bound of @xmath156 .",
    "we found the three triples by considering all triples @xmath152 with @xmath157 with @xmath158 .    in dimension",
    "@xmath34 we use three quadruples @xmath159 of squared norms for : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , where the last coordinate of @xmath163 is a root of @xmath164 . solving the corresponding linear programming problem yields the new upper bound of @xmath165 .",
    "we found the three quadruples by considering all triples @xmath163 with @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "a few technical remarks concerning the numerical calculations are in order . for solving the linear programs we use the software lpsolve @xcite and we generate the input using the program gp / pari @xcite .",
    "we discretize the conditions of the form @xmath168 by discretizing the interval @xmath169 $ ] into steps of size @xmath170 .",
    "now we demonstrate in the case @xmath171 how we turn the numerical calculations into a rigorous mathematical proof : the linear program has the optimal numerical solution @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174",

    "the function @xmath178 is positive for @xmath179 because there @xmath180 and @xmath181 holds .",
    "thus by adding @xmath182 to @xmath18 we make sure that the new function @xmath178 is nonnegative .",
    "this only slightly effects the value of the bound .",
    "in this section we quickly report on the problem of finding the smallest extreme density a measurable set in the plane can have which avoids exactly two distances , i.e. , @xmath183 .",
    "szkely @xcite showed that this number is at most @xmath184 by giving an upper bound for @xmath185 . by solving the corresponding linear program on the computer",
    "we improve his bound to @xmath186 . by adjusting the distances we can improve this further : @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the first two positive zeros of the bessel function @xmath190 .    by combining bukh s result , which we explained in the introduction , with our new bound on @xmath28 from the previous section we can improve on this even further : @xmath191",
