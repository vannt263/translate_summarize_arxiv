    "key signatures of these topological phases are the existence of protected ( charge or spin ) edge states .",
    "some effects of correlations on such topological phases have already been reviewed in ref .",

    "@xcite , haldane has shown how spinless fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice with a particular flux pattern ( but no net flux per plaquette ) can realize a topological insulating phase , dubbed nowadays a chern insulator .",
    "this is a way to realize a quantum hall state without magnetic field and has generated a lot of activity . on the experimental side ,",
    "a great motivation came from the discovery of graphene  @xcite , which is a purely two - dimensional material consisting of a one - atom - thick sheet of graphite . in 2005 , kane and mele have proposed that graphene could realize a spin topological insulator with helical edge states provided its intrinsic spin - orbit coupling would be large enough  @xcite . unfortunately , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite point to a rather small spin - orbit coupling ( of order @xmath0  k ) .",

    "although this is an appealing roadmap to follow in order to stabilize some exotic phases , this remains quite challenging since strongly correlated systems can not often be studied in some unbiased way .",
    "our main interest in this review is to understand whether interactions _ alone _ can generate a topological phase starting from a _",

    ", we will consider only the simplest situation",
    "in order to focus on the simplest relevant model for the physics that we are discussing , we will consider interacting spinless fermions at half - filling on a honeycomb lattice , i.e. the following hamiltonian  : @xmath1 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : latticebz](a ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the spinless fermionic operators , @xmath4 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the density - density repulsion or attraction strengths respectively on nearest- ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) .    , @xmath6 interactions and the hopping @xmath7 .",

    "in this section , we will review various analytical and numerical approaches that have been applied to model ( [ eq : hspinless ] ) .",
    "we will describe the different possible phases that have been proposed , and show when available the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "let us start by considering the non - interacting spinless case . from the seminal paper by wallace  @xcite",
    ", it is known that , at half - filling , the band structure exhibits two dirac cones in the brillouin zone .",
    "this is theoretically very appealing since it allows to observe relativistic phenomena in condensed matter systems  @xcite and has been experimentally realized first with the discovery of graphene  @xcite .",
    "now , when considering the two - dimensional dirac equation , it is possible to classify the relevant perturbations that could open a gap :    * if one adds a potential term that breaks the sublattice symmetry but preserves time - reversal symmetry , then a nel cdw i can emerge  @xcite . *",
    "if one modulates the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes then a kekul bond - density wave ( that preserves sublattice and time - reversal symmetries ) emerges  @xcite . * in the presence of next - nearest - neighbor hopping with fluxes ( but no net total flux per hexagon ) , then the qah bond - density wave ( that breaks both sublattice and time - reversal symmetries ) can be stabilized as shown by haldane  @xcite .",
    "these phases can thus be understood as resulting from the relevant effects of 4 different mass terms  @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "the spinful case is far much richer with 36 masses that can be added to the dirac equation so that several different phases can be realized  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us remind the reader that due to a vanishing density of states in the noninteracting semi - metallic phase , a finite @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 is needed for any kind of instability .",
    "given all the possible instabilities of the semi - metallic phase , first attempts were made to investigate the zero - temperature phase diagram using mean - field analysis . in a seminal paper , raghu _",

    "there it was found that not only kekul phase can appear , but also the more interesting topological qah can still be stabilized for a large range of parameters .",
    "however , in the latter study  @xcite , the topological qah phase has shrunk substantially due to the emergence of a charge - modulated ( cm ) phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mf3 ] ) .",
    "this phase is characterized by a larger unit cell and a distribution of charges on each hexagon as @xmath18 .",
    "physically , the additional modulation allows to gain some energy by reducing the nnn repulsion @xmath6 at the cost of some unsatisfied @xmath5 bonds .    as a partial conclusion",

    "however , being uncontrolled approximation , it can miss some phases and can not locate accurately phase boundaries . therefore , it should always be used with some caution .",
    "so we now turn to strong coupling analysis that can shed light from an opposite perspective .      in our recent work",
    "@xcite , we have suggested to investigate the strong - coupling regime , i.e. @xmath19 , starting from the analysis of the _ classical _ ground - states .    using a systematic enumeration on finite clusters ,",
    "we have established the @xmath20 classical phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath25 point develops into the charge modulation ( cm ) phase , while the @xmath26 point broadens into a novel `` nel domain wall crystal '' ( ndwc ) , which is sketched in fig .",

    "\\(i ) for @xmath27 ( corresponding to ising models on two decoupled triangular lattices ) , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , there are an extensive number of ground - states ; ( ii ) in the lower part of the phase diagram , we have found regions with two - fold degenerate ground - states , corresponding on one - side to standard nel cdw phase ( with particles occupying only one sublattice ) and on the other side to a region of phase separation where the system prefers to be either empty or completely filled with fermions ; ( iii ) in the upper part , the number of ground - states increases with increasing system size @xmath30 , and the patterns that we observe on both sides correspond respectively to zigzag or stripy patterns , possibly with defects .    given the large degeneracy of the frustrated classical model in some large portions of the parameters space , one expects on general grounds that , in the presence of a finite hopping term @xmath7 , quantum fluctuations will select some ordered state through an order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "thus , one possible attempt to detect this order consists in diagonalizing the kinetic operator _ projected onto the classical manifold_. note that this is a major simplification compared to solving the full quantum mechanical problem .    performing this job ,",

    "the major caveat is of course size limitation which can prevent conclusion on the thermodynamic limit , or the difficulty to tackle with incommensurate phases for instance  .",
    "therefore , we will argue that a systematic study should be performed , i.e. one should consider different cluster sizes ( with different @xmath34 points in their brillouin zone ) that can accomodate various phases and also one should try to perform finite - size scaling ( even though it is limited typically to less than 50 sites in the spinless case ) .",
