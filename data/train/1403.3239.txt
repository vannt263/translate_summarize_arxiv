    "@xmath1 orionis e is the archetype of an unusual and rare class of helium - strong main sequence b stars @xcite , characterized by extremely large magnetic fields and fast rotation .",
    "@xmath1 ori e itself has a measured longitudinal magnetic field varying with an amplitude of @xmath4 kg with an inferred polar magnetic strength of @xmath5 kg @xcite a rotational velocity of @xmath6 , and a rotational period of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the high magnetic field of the star is thought to form a rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm ) @xcite which traps circumstellar material in two co - rotating clouds at a distance of several stellar radii beyond the photospheric surface , producing an extremely broad , double - horned h@xmath8  emission profile with velocity width @xmath9 as well as periodic modulation of the star s light curve .",
    "the magnetic field also appears to be responsible for the enhanced he absorption via localized surface abundance anomalies it creates in the star . a more recently - discovered star in the same class , hr 7355 @xcite , shows similarly he - strong absorption and polar field strength ( @xmath10 kg ) to @xmath1 ori e , and corresponding h@xmath8  emission profiles with velocity widths of @xmath11 .",
    "hr 7355 shows exceptionally fast rotation ( @xmath12 d and @xmath13 ) ; this star , along with hr5907 ( @xmath14d , @xmath15 ) , are the two fastest - rotating , non - degenerate magnetic stars known  in fact , their speeds approach the rotational breakup velocity @xcite . the simultaneous presence of such extreme rotation and large magnetic field is somewhat surprising for massive b stars , and for hr 7355 the spindown timescale via magnetic braking should be much shorter than its estimated age @xcite . thus , these stars provide a unique conundrum for theories of both star formation and magnetic field evolution . increasing the known number of these objects will allow us to understand how common this phenomenon is for massive stars , and establish the range of properties they can exhibit .",
    "in this paper , we present the discovery of two additional members of this rare class of stars from the sloan digital sky survey iii s apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( sdss - iii / apogee ) @xcite .",
    "apogee is a near - infrared ( nir ) , h - band ( @xmath16 m ) , high - resolution ( @xmath17 ) , spectroscopic survey primarily targeting red giant stars in the milky way . as part of routine survey operation ,",
    "apogee selects bright , hot , blue stars in each survey field for telluric correction of the red giant spectra .",
    "below , we describe the serendipitous discovery of the two @xmath1 ori e type stars among these apogee telluric standards , identified via the unique magnetospheric signatures they produce in their brackett series emission profiles .",
    "we next present optical spectra that confirm the he - strong classification of one star and the apparent `` he - normal '' nature of the other , allow measurements of @xmath18 , and show evidence of h@xmath8  profiles matching the brackett series rrm signatures .",
    "we also present triplespec nir spectra of these two stars and @xmath1 ori e itself , which confirm the similarities among all three stars and the `` smoking gun '' signature provided by the brackett series line profiles created by the rigidly rotating magnetospheres in these stars .",
    "we conclude by discussing the potential for further discovery of @xmath1 ori e type stars during the apogee survey , and the implications they will have for understanding the breadth of characteristics in the population of these objects , their origin , and their evolution .",
    "to assess and remove telluric absorption features from apogee science spectra , 35 of the 300 instrument fibers used in each observation are used to observe hot , blue stars simultaneously with the normal science targets @xcite .",
    "the first 18 telluric calibrators selected are subject to a spatial constraint , whereby the apogee field in question is divided into 18 equal - area zones and the bluest star ( in raw @xmath19 color , with @xmath20 mag ) in each zone is selected as a target .",
    "the remaining 17 telluric calibrators are simply the bluest stars anywhere in the field of view not previously selected .",
    "visual inspection of these spectra led to the identification of numerous be stars , which we placed into a numbered list ( in order of discovery ) for further study .",
    "hd 23478 ( abe-075 ) was observed a total of nine times , with apporximately 1-hr observation each time , on the six different fiber plug plates designed for a special study of the young open cluster ic348 .",
    "hd 345439 ( abe-050 ) , however , was only observed on an apogee instrument commissioning fiber plate ( a plate designed for testing of sky and telluric removal ) . while this plate was observed twice , the second observation produced poor s / n .",
    "fortunately the first observation achieved good s / n ( @xmath21 per resolution element in the continuum ) .    in figure 1 , we present the apogee nir discovery spectra for the two newly - identified @xmath1 ori e stars  labeled abe-050 ( hd 345439 ) and abe-075 ( hd 23478 ) in the apogee catalog of be stars . in the apogee bandpass , we can see prominent brackett series emission lines ( br11-br20 ) from both stars , each with a characteristic double - horned profile . in figure 2 , we display a detailed view of the br11 line profiles from each star  as may be seen , the profile peak separations approach @xmath22 , which is @xmath23 times greater than the largest linewidths seen from more `` normal '' be stars observed by apogee @xcite .",
    "this type of profile and peak separation is typical of the rrm feature of @xmath1 ori e stars , and is strong evidence that hd 345439 and hd 23478 are likely to be rapidly - rotating , highly magnetized stars . in short , the apogee infrared color selection for telluric standards ( which selects stars with colors roughly similar to b stars ) and apogee spectra alone make these stars strong candidates for the @xmath1 ori e type classification .",
    "based on this initial identification , we obtained followup optical spectra of hd 345439 and hd 23478 , as well as @xmath24 m nir spectra of both stars and @xmath1 ori e itself to confirm the identification . in the optical , we observed both stars using the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het , @xcite ) as part of queue - scheduled observing in the lower priority band @xcite at @xmath25 with the cross disperser set to achieve spectra from @xmath26   on the blue detector and from @xmath27   on the red detector . we reduced the spectra with iraf echelle tasks , using the standard iraf tasks for overscan removal , bias subtraction , flat fielding , scattered light removal and wavelength calibration .",
    "we present the resulting spectra in figure 3 .    at first glance ,",
    "the optical spectra of both stars - especially the region blueward of h@xmath8   resemble those of typical b - stars , with strong balmer absorption lines as well as prominent he absorption features .",
    "however , the absorption lines show very broad symmetric profiles that indicate high rotational velocities , and for hd 345439 the hei lines are unusually strong . comparing its spectrum to the typical b stars in @xcite ,",
    "the presence and strength of the hei lines constrain hd 345439 to be in the spectral range of o9 to b3 .",
    "the absence of heii @xmath28 constrains both stars to be later than b0 , and hd 345439 closely matches b1v or b2v stars in the strength of siii @xmath29 and mgii @xmath30 , which are key indicators in this sequence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strength of hei @xmath31 , oii @xmath32 , and the lack of detectable emission from oii @xmath33 , oii @xmath34 and si iii @xmath35 all confirm the main sequence classification of this star .",
    "however , none of the `` normal '' stars in @xcite possess the hei absorption strength we see in hd 345439 .",
    "hd 23478 , on the other hand , appears optically to be a fairly `` normal '' star at first glance , based on the blue part of its spectrum , with much weaker he absorption than hd 345439 .",
    "this object was previously classified as a b3iv star @xcite , and this classification is confirmed in our spectrum by the presence and strength of the mgii @xmath36 , cii @xmath37 , and siii @xmath38 absorption features . however , the hei ratio of @xmath39 is @xmath40 in hd 23478  a peculiarity not seen in other stars , where the ratio is typically @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath8  features in both hd 345439 and hd 23478 display the pronounced broad emission typical of rrm stars in both hd 23478 and hd 345439 .",
    "we also obtained triplespec @xcite nir spectra of hd 345439 , hd 23478 , and @xmath1 ori e itself ( figure 4 ) , using the apo 3.5 m .",
    "we used the 1@xmath421 slit , for @xmath43 spectra between 0.95 - 2.46 @xmath44 m , and all data were acquired nodding in abba mode .",
    "eight 90 second integrations of hd 345439 and twenty 20 second integrations of the a0v star hd 189690 , used for telluric correction @xcite , were obtained on 2012 september 3 .",
    "eight 30 second integrations of hd 23478 and four 30 second integrations of the a0v star hr 1724 were performed on 2013 february 15 .",
    "six 60 second integrations of @xmath1 ori e and six 60 second integrations of the a0v star hd 67015 were obtained on 2013 january 25 .",
    "these data were reduced using triplespectool , a modified version of spextool developed for use with the spex instrument at irtf @xcite .",
    "the strongest features of all three spectra are again the extremely broad double - horned brackett - series emission profiles that distinguish the rigidly - rotating magnetospheres of these stars .",
    "hd 345439 appears to have the strongest rrm feature at these particular epochs of observation , while hd 23478 and @xmath1 ori e are similar in emission strengths / widths ( with @xmath1 ori e being slightly more asymmetric and with deeper absorption depth at these epochs ) . here",
    "again hd 23478 shows significantly weaker hei absorption features ( i.e. , at @xmath45 m and at @xmath46 m ) than the other two stars .",
    "the persistence of this weak absorption at multiple epochs seems to indicate that hd 23478 may truly be more `` he - normal '' than hd 345439 and the rrm archetype @xmath1 ori e - though more data are needed to confirm this conclusion .    to measure @xmath18 for the stars , we fit line profiles for the hei absorption features at @xmath31 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and account for non - rotational effects according to the correction factors in @xcite , which then lead to @xmath18 values of @xmath50 for hd 345439 and @xmath51 for hd 23478 .",
    "these measurements are typical of the fast - rotating highly - magnetized @xmath1 ori e stars ",
    "the @xmath18 for hd 23478 is very similar to ( albeit slightly slower than ) the value for @xmath1 ori e itself , while hd 345439 appears to be one of the fastest known rotators among main sequence stars , surpassed only by the two recently discovered @xmath1 ori e stars , hr 7355 and hr 5907 .",
    "previous work @xcite indicates a photometric period for hd 23478 of @xmath52d , which is also very similar to ( and slightly faster than ) the measured @xmath53d rotation period of @xmath1 ori e. these rotational properties confirm our classification of hd 345439 and hd 23478 as @xmath1 ori e stars .",
    "we measured the hei equivalent widths for both stars and present them along with values for typical b stars , as well as @xmath1 ori e , in figure 5 . again , this confirms that hd 345439 is typically `` he - strong '' , as are other @xmath1 ori e stars , while hd 23478 may be `` he - normal '' , despite being a fast rotator with the clear signature of a rrm .",
    "we note that helium absorption strength can be phase - dependent in the @xmath1 ori e stars , and the variations may be large enough to mask their `` he - strong '' nature at some rotational phases , so additional phase - sampled spectra are required to confirm this conclusion .",
    "the @xmath1 ori e stars present a mystery for stellar evolution .",
    "b - stars should not have large convective zones , and thus are expected to possess relatively weak magnetic fields  but typically measured field strengths for @xmath1 ori e analogs are @xmath54 kg and higher , in apparent ( and strong ) contradiction of this theoretical expectation .",
    "furthermore , most theories predict that young b stars should spin down on a @xmath55myr timescale , but the @xmath1 ori e star hr7355 appears to be @xmath56myr old @xcite and yet has a high rotational velocity .",
    "while we can not measure the magnetic field from our current data , the unique rrm signature clearly indicates that hd 345439 and hd 23478 are also magnetized stars ( which future spectropolarimetry observations could confirm ) , and they are both definitely fast rotators . while the rrm can theoretically arise in any star where the alfven radius exceeds the kelperian co - rotation radius @xcite , in which case fields as low as @xmath57 kgauss",
    "could suffice , the other resemblances between these stars and the @xmath1 ori e stars seem to imply that similar field strengths of @xmath5 kgauss are most likely . in the case of hd 23478 , its sky position , parallax of 4.99 mas , and proper motion of @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xcite all match the members of the ic 348 young open cluster @xcite .",
    "this result constrains the age of hd 23478 to match that of ic 348  previously estimated as @xmath60 myr by @xcite ; @xcite however have recently derived an age closer to @xmath61 myr based on current isochrone - fitting techniques .",
    "future measurements of the magnetic field in this star can then provide an estimated spindown timescale , to see if this star matches expectations or , like hr 7355 , seems to be spinning too fast for its age and magnetic field .",
    "as this work has shown , a particularly promising avenue for identifying more of these unusual stars is near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "we believe the apogee spectra in figure 1 to be the first published nir spectra of @xmath1 ori e stars , and they are remarkable in the strength of the rrm signatures in the brackett lines . based on our sample of spectra ( which are admittedly few in number and sparse in phase sampling ) , each individual brackett transition shows stronger rrm signatures than h@xmath8  for the same star , and the presence of @xmath62 transitions in just @xmath63 of the h - band makes the nir an exceptionally powerful new diagnostic approach for identifying @xmath1 ori e stars .",
    "our discoveries were entirely serendipitous , yet they have increased the known sample of these stars by @xmath64% , and hd 345439 alone has enhanced the number of `` extreme '' ( near - breakup velocity ) rotators by 50% . furthermore , the optical spectra of these stars are much more `` normal '' than their nir spectra - both hd 23478 and hd 345439 have previous optical observations and classifications that entirely missed their rrm nature .",
    "we can see in figure 4 that the brackett series rrm signatures are substantially stronger than even the nir paschen series , indicating that the nir h - band may be a `` sweet spot '' for this diagnostic .",
    "the fact that hd 23478 is both nearby and bright in the optical , yet eluded rrm classification until now , further accentuates the diagnostic power of nir spectroscopy for this work .",
    "thus , with the advent of powerful ir spectrographs at many observatories , and of large - scale ir spectroscopic surveys such as apogee , we can speculate that the discovery of these previously - rare stars may accelerate quickly in the near future .",
