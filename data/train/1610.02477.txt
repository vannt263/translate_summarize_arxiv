    "quantum coherence is one of the fundamental features which distinguish quantum world from classical realm .",
    "it is the origin for extensive quantum phenomena such as interference , laser , superconductivity @xcite and superfluidity @xcite .",
    "it is an important subject related to quantum mechanics , from quantum optics @xcite , solid state physics @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , to quantum biology @xcite .",
    "coherence , together with quantum correlations like quantum entanglement @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , are crucial ingredients in quantum computation and information tasks @xcite .",
    "coherence shines its quantum merits in quantum metrology @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , entanglement creation @xcite , etc .    unlike quantum entanglement and other quantum correlations , coherence ,",
    "regarded as a physical resource @xcite , has been just investigated very recently in establishing the framework of quantifying coherence in the language of quantum information theory @xcite . due to its fundamental role in quantum physics and quantum information theory ,",
    "it is still necessary to understand how coherence works in information processing and investigate the relations between coherence and quantum correlations .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the creation of coherence of a quantum system a , which initially has zero coherence , with the help of quantum channels on another quantum system b. such creation of coherence depends on the correlations between a and b , as well as the quantum operations on system b. we establish an explicit relation among the creation of the coherence on system a , the quantum entanglement ( concurrence ) between a and b , and the quantum operations .    remote creation of coherence ( rcc ) can be illustrated by a simple example .",
    "consider a two - qubit system ab , which is initially in the maximally entangled state @xmath0 . if b undergoes a projective measurement under basis @xmath1 , and tells measurement outcome , for example @xmath2 , to a , the system a s final state would be a superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with some probability , if the basis @xmath2 is neither @xmath3 nor @xmath4 .",
    "the same analysis also holds for measurement outcome @xmath5 .",
    "namely , system a can gain an averaged coherence over all the outcomes .    for general states , we first investigate what kind of states can be used to create remote coherence and present a necessary and sufficient condition . then for pure states , we give a necessary and sufficient condition that the operations must satisfy for nonzero rcc . and finally , we give upper bounds of rcc and investigate the relations between coherence and entanglement in our scenario .",
    "since a quantum state s coherence depends on the reference basis , throughout our paper , we fix the system a s reference basis to be the computational basis .",
    "a well defined and mostly used coherence measure is the @xmath6 norm coherence @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 norm coherence of a quantum state is defined as the sum of all off - diagonal elements of the state s density matrix under the reference basis , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the absolute value of @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we use the @xmath6 norm coherence when we discuss the upper bound of rcc and its relation to entanglement .",
    "let @xmath11 be a bipartite quantum state and @xmath12 a quantum operation acting on the subsystem b. let @xmath13/\\operatorname{tr}[(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes \\$ ) { \\rho^{ab}}]$ ] be the reduced state of the system a after the operation . concerning the quantum operations used for remote creation of coherence with a general quantum state , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] given a bipartite quantum state @xmath11 , for any quantum operation @xmath12 acting on the subsystem b , the coherence of the final subsystem a @xmath14 if and only if @xmath11 is an incoherent - quantum state @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the quantum state of system ab under the computational basis , then the marginal state @xmath17 .",
    "after the quantum operation @xmath18 acting on b , @xmath19 becomes , @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] is the probability of getting the state @xmath22 .",
    "tracing over the system b , we get the final state of system a , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "`` @xmath26 '' .  from equations",
    "( [ cl1 ] ) and ( [ mixrhoap ] ) , for any operation @xmath18 , @xmath27 means that for any @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 for the arbitrary hermitian operator @xmath32 ( the operation @xmath18 is aribitray ) , @xmath33 and the diagonal entries of @xmath28 are arbitrary real numbers which are independent of the off diagonal entries .",
    "thus from ( [ mix1 ] ) , we get @xmath34 , @xmath35 . on the other hand , for all @xmath29",
    ", @xmath36 set @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the unit imaginary number . substituting it into the above equation , we get @xmath39=0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath40 @xmath41 is arbitrary , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are all independent",
    ". then equation ( [ mix2 ] ) implies that for all @xmath44 , @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . therefore @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "hence the initial state @xmath11 becomes @xmath50 which actually is an incoherent - quantum state @xcite .",
    "`` @xmath51 '' .  if @xmath11 is an incoherent - quantum state , @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to check that , for any operation @xmath18 acting on system b , the final state of the system a , @xmath13/\\operatorname{tr}[(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes \\$ ) { \\rho^{ab}}]$ ] , has zero coherence .    from the above proof",
    "one can see that @xmath52 also means that the initial coherence of system a is also zero , @xmath53 .",
    "the above theorem implies that any non - incoherent quantum state can be used for rcc under certain operations .",
    "note that the incoherent - quantum state actually is the classical - quantum correlated state with the fixed reference basis @xcite .",
    "thus the states , that can be used to create coherence , are not limited within entangled states .",
    "according to theorem [ th1 ] a non - incoherent - quantum separable state , with the system a having zero coherence , can also be used for rcc .",
    "interestingly , the condition in theorem [ th1 ] for creating nonzero rcc is the same as the distillable coherence of collaboration in @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that our scenario is different from the asymptotic scenario in @xcite . in @xcite , they study the maximal distilled coherence of collaboration under local quantum - incoherent operations and bilateral classical communications for the asymptotic case . while our work investigates the system a s average coherence after system b going through a _",
    "certain _ quantum channel ( see the rest of our paper ) , and the rcc in our scenario only requires one way classical communication and does not involve the maximal process @xcite .",
    "the next natural question is , for a non - incoherent quantum state , what is the exact form of the operation acting on system b for the creation of coherence ?",
    "obviously for operation @xmath54 acting on system b such that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an arbitrary real number bigger than 1 , the coherence can not be created , which can be seen by substituting @xmath57 into equation ( [ mixrhoap ] ) .",
    "one can check that the important quantum operations including depolarizing operations , phase flip operations , bit flip operations and bit - phase flip operations all belong to this form . moreover , all the trace preserving quantum channels will not create the coherence remotely , and measurements on the system b are necessary in order to create nonzero coherence .",
    "we give the necessary and sufficient condition for rcc in the following .",
    "let @xmath58 be a pure bipartite entangled quantum state with zero coherence of the system a. we have    [ th2 ] after a quantum operation @xmath12 acts on the system b , the system a , with initial coherence being zero , gains coherence if and only if there is a computational basis @xmath59 with @xmath60\\neq 0 $ ] , where @xmath61 is the initial state of ab , @xmath62 and @xmath63=ab - ba$ ] is the lie bracket .    with the local computational basis , the state of system ab can be expressed as @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the normalization condition .",
    "one has @xmath66 . respect to @xmath53 ,",

    "thus we get the schmidt decomposition , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "we also have @xmath75 .    after the local operation acting on the system b , the final state of the system a has the form , @xmath76/p ' \\\\ = & \\operatorname{tr}_b [ ( \\mathbb{i}\\otimes \\$)\\sum _",

    "in fact , from the proof we have also given the explicit form of the quantum operation that can not create coherence of system a. such operation @xmath28 has the form : @xmath89 , where @xmath90s are arbitrary real numbers in @xmath91 $ ] , @xmath92 .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] shows the necessary and sufficient condition for quantum operations that create nonzero coherence .",
    "now we study how much rcc can be created and the relation between rcc and the entanglement between a and b.

    "b , one interesting thing is that the upper bound of rcc ( [ bound1 ] ) is proportional to the entanglement while inversely proportional to the probability of getting the final state . here , one should note that @xmath99s depend on the local schmidt decomposition basis , hence the bound ( [ bound1 ] ) not only depends on the entanglement between a and b , but also the local basis of the system b , as the coherence is a basis dependent quantity .",
    "next , we investigate the relations among the average rcc under an operation on the system b for maximally entangled states , that for an arbitrarily given pure quantum state and the entanglement of this given state .    consider a pure bipartite entangled state @xmath88 and a trace preserving quantum channel @xmath104 , @xmath105 . under the channel @xmath18 on the system",

    ", if each @xmath130 is given by one kraus operator , @xmath135 , then one recovers the result for a trace preserving channel .",
    "it should be noticed here that for the remote creation of the averaged coherence , the one - way classical communication is required .",
    "otherwise , one would end up with super - luminal signaling .",
    "_ remark _ averaging the @xmath130s for equation ( [ bound1 ] ) we can also obtain a tighter bound for the average rcc .",
    "@xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with @xmath139 as given in ( [ beta ] ) .",

    "in particular , for two - qubit case , we have the following theorem :    [ th4 ] for a pure @xmath144 entangled state @xmath88 with zero coherence of system a , under a trace preserving quantum channel @xmath104 on system b , the average rcc of @xmath88 equals to the product of the entanglement of @xmath88 and the average rcc of @xmath88 s corresponding maximally entangled state @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath145    the proof for the above can be derived by noting that , in @xmath144 case , the summation in ( [ neq1 ] ) and ( [ neq2 ] ) only contains one entry which leads to that the equality holds in theorem [ th3 ] .",
    "the above factorization law manifests that , in a @xmath140 system , if the operations satisfy the nonzero rcc condition in theorem [ th2 ] , then the average rcc of the state is proportional to its entanglement . since the entanglement is smaller than 1 , its average rcc is always smaller than its corresponding maximal entangled state s average rcc . fig .",

    "it should be noted that the coherence depends on the reference basis , while the entanglement is local unitary invariant .",
    "hence we fix the same basis for the maximally entangled state @xmath110 to the one of @xmath88 s schmidt basis .    besides quantum entanglement",
    ", similar relations like ( [ bound2 ] ) or ( [ bound3 ] ) may also exist for other quantum correlations like quantum discord , as theorem [ th1 ] implies that all the non - incoherent - quantum states are useful for rcc , other quantum correlations could be responsible for rcc either .",
