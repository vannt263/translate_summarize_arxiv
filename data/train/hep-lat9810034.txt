    "if the hierarchical approximation could be improved in a way which maintain the advantages of the approximation , one could obtain results with an accuracy which would outperform any monte carlo method and defy any experimental patience .    in the following , we use the scaling laws@xcite to express the renormalized quantities as function of the bare quantities and a uv cut - off .",

    "the non - smoothness of these differences in bin 13 indicates that they are due to the numerical errors on @xmath18 .",

    "the main result obtained there is that all the corrections can be parametrized in the following way : @xmath250 in the next subsection , we analyze the data in terms of the new parametrization and extrapolate our results in order to estimate the errors made in the calculations of @xmath2 and @xmath38 in the previous section .",
    "the previous analysis , describes the linearized flows near the fixed point .",
    "the closer to criticality we are , the more iterations are spent close to the fixed point and the more accurate the linear description is . nevertheless , when we approach or leave the fixed point , nonlinear effects are unavoidable .",
    "these nonlinear effects can be studied more easily in low - dimensional maps . without entering into the detail of this analysis@xcite",

    "we argue here that the coefficients of the non - zero powers are suppressed by 14 orders of magnitude .",
    "the rationale for this suppression is that the non - zero modes contribute to the extrapolated slope ( an asymptotic estimator for @xmath256 used with the high - temperature expansion ) with about the same strength as the zero mode@xcite . however , this is the result of a double amplification for the non - zero modes .",
    "this results from the equations ( 3.7 ) to ( 3.10 ) of ref .",
    "first , when calculating the coefficients of high temperature expansion one gets an amplification factor of order @xmath257 .",
    "second , while calculating the extrapolated slope , one gets another amplification by a factor @xmath258 . putting these two factor together ,",
    "we obtain the claimed 14 orders of magnitude .",
    "such a small effect is smaller than our numerical resolution .",
    "second , the singularity @xmath259 should be replaced by @xmath260 with coefficients @xmath261 calculable in low dimensional maps .",
    "these corrections generate _ analytical _ corrections to the scaling law in contrast to the subleading corrections which are in general not integer powers    third the nonlinear corrections associated with the irrelevant directions generate corrections which are presumably of the form @xmath262 with @xmath263 .",

    "the reason for doing this is that in the ising case , the ratio @xmath265 while in the lg case , @xmath218 .",
    "the relative size of the quadratic corrections is presumably of order @xmath266 and these corrections will be more sizable in the ising case .",
    "we start with the assumption that there is one next subleading correction which dominates when we move from bin 13 to smaller values of @xmath183 . in other words , @xmath267 in an intermediate @xmath183 region . in this equation ,",
    "the four parameters @xmath2 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath268 are understood as their best estimates near criticality obtained in the previous section .",

    "the corrections in bin 8 are thus of order @xmath270 which is precisely of the same order as the numerical errors if we use double - precision calculations .",
    "consequently we had to use the @xmath135-based method described in the section [ subsec : numerr ] in order to get at least 4 significant digits for the corrections . for time considerations ,",
    "we have limited our calculations to 10 points per bin .    if eq .",

    "[ fig : subsub1 ] for the lg model .",

    "( [ eq : nextsublead ] ) .",
    "the departure from linearity occurs in its most extreme way as dips located near @xmath283 in the ising case and @xmath284 in the lg case .",
    "these dips signal the existence of effects of opposite signs",
    ". a plausible interpretation of the location of these dips is that they occur at values of @xmath183 where the @xmath285 prevail over the @xmath286 analytical corrections .",
    "a detailed analysis confirms this view for the ising model , which allows us to neglect the analytical corrections in bin 13 . for the lg model ,",
    "two effects compete in bin 10 which is dangerously close to bin 13 where the parameters are fined - tuned ( see below ) and we were unable to get a clear linear behavior after one more subtraction .",

    "near @xmath284 , we have @xmath287 which implies @xmath288 . with this rough estimates",

    "this assumption is well - obeyed in the ising case but is just an order magnitude estimate in the lg case .",
    "we are now in position to estimate the effects of the next subleading corrections in the calculation of the critical exponents reported in the previous section .",
    "first of all , we notice that by extrapolating the dominant linear behavior described in the previous subsection to bin 13 , we obtain effects smaller than @xmath290 in the ising case and smaller than @xmath246 in the lg case .",
    "this justifies treating them as small perturbations in bin 13 .",
    "when we fitted the data in bin 13 without taking these small effects into account , we made small adjustments in the fitted parameters which allowed us to fit the data with a precision comparable to the numerical precision . in order",
    "to get a rough estimate of how much the next subleading corrections led us to misestimate the exponents , we can linearize the next subleading corrections about @xmath291 .",

    "<S> we calculate the critical exponent @xmath0 of dyson s hierarchical model by direct fits of the zero momentum two - point function calculated with an ising and a landau - ginzburg measure , and by linearization about the koch - wittwer fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we extract three types of subleading corrections ( in other words , a parametrization of the way the two - point function depends on the cutoff ) from the fits and check the value of the first subleading exponent from the linearized procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that all the non - universal quantities entering the subleading corrections can be calculated systematically from the non - linear contributions about the fixed point and that this procedure would provide an alternative way to introduce the bare parameters in a field theory model .    2 20.5pc = 8pt plus 4pt minus 3pt </S>"
