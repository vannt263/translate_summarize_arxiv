    "recently , an important contribution in the theory of exactly solvable one dimensional dirac hamiltonians was done by dunne and thies @xcite .",

    "a transparent system , also called reflectionless , is peculiar by the absence of any reflection in the scattering modes .",
    "the results of @xcite were originally motivated by their connection with hartree - fock scattering solutions of @xmath0 dimensional quantum field theories of massless , self - interacting dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the two dimensional gross - neveu ( gn@xmath1 ) @xcite and nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl@xmath2 ) models @xcite , the self - consistent mean field potentials turn out to be transparent in the case of scattering , static or time - dependent , solutions @xcite .",
    "this means that the gn@xmath1 and njl@xmath2 models can be solved analytically by using the hartree - fock approximation , where the dynamics is reduced into a single particle dirac equation , accompanied by an additional requirement of self - consistency , see for example @xcite . in this context , the transparent scalar and pseudo - scalar potentials in dirac equation can be treated as fermion condensates and correspond to scattering solutions of the gap equation in the gn@xmath1 and njl@xmath2 models @xcite .",

    "this conserved quantity coincides with the higher order matrix differential lax operator of the akns hierarchy .",
    "together with the hamiltonian , they compose the so called lax pair @xcite of a corresponding hierarchy of stationary non - linear integrable equations .",
    "non - relativistic reflectionless systems are associated with the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy whereas the dirac hamiltonians with scalar reflectionless potentials with the mkdv hierarchy .",

    "keeping in mind the definition ( [ lpl ] ) , we can write @xmath183=\\\\ \\notag   & 2i\\epsilon_{abc}\\tilde{\\sigma}_cp(h ) -(e_1+e_2)l\\left(\\sigma_a[h_0,\\sigma_b]-\\sigma_b[h_0,\\sigma_a]\\right)l^{\\dagger}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the use of ( [ hps ] ) , we can rewrite the second term as a linear combination of the known integrals . this way , we get the following algebra @xmath184= 2i\\epsilon_{ijk}\\tilde{\\sigma}_kp(h)-2(e_1+e_2 ) \\left ( -\\delta_{2i}\\tilde{p}_j+\\delta_{2j}\\tilde{p}_i\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & -2(e_1+e_2)\\left(m(\\delta_{1i}\\tilde{\\sigma}_{j}-\\delta_{1j}\\tilde{\\sigma}_i)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & -4i(e_1+e_2)\\left(\\epsilon_{2ij}\\tilde{p}_0 - 2im\\epsilon_{1ij}\\tilde{\\sigma}_0\\right)\\,,\\\\ & \\ , [ \\tilde{p}_i,\\tilde{p}_j]= [ \\tilde{\\sigma_i},\\tilde{\\sigma}_j](\\mathcal{h}-m^2)\\,,\\\\ & [ \\tilde{\\sigma}_i,\\tilde{p}_j]= 2i\\epsilon_{ijk}p(h)\\tilde{p}_k+4i(e_1+e_2)m\\epsilon_{1ij}\\tilde{p}_0\\nonumber\\\\ & -2(e_1+e_2 ) ( -\\delta_{2i}\\tilde{\\sigma}_j+\\delta_{2j}\\tilde{\\sigma}_i)(\\mathcal{h}-m^2)\\nonumber\\\\&-2(e_1+e_2)\\left(m(\\delta_{1i}\\tilde{p}_{j}-\\delta_{1j}\\tilde{p}_i ) + 2i\\epsilon_{2ij}(\\mathcal{h}-m^2)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see that when @xmath185 , the second term in the commutator cancels out and the operators close a lie algebra which is a deformation of ( [ a2 ] ) with energy - dependent structure coefficients .",
    "in this paper , distinct aspects of darboux transformations and their applications into different models were considered .",
    "a four - parameter family of reflectionless ( transparent ) potentials was derived by means of a darboux transformation applied on the free particle dirac hamiltonian . using this technique ,",
    "static scattering solutions of the njl@xmath1 model can be found .",
    "several comments are in order :    * the darboux transformations ( [ l ] ) can be utilized to generalize a hierarchy of transparent hamiltonians .",
    "this can be done by applying a consecutive chain of such darboux transformations .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath186 intertwines the initial hamiltonian @xmath15 with @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 can have one or two additional bound states when compared to @xmath15 , in dependence on the explicit choice of the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , see ( [ v ] ) and the discussion below .",
    "we can take @xmath187 as the initial system now and define the new darboux transformation @xmath188 and the new hamiltonian @xmath189 that satisfies @xmath190 .",
    "thus , we also have @xmath191 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath189 can have up to four additional bound states when compared to @xmath15 . in this way",
    ", we can create a whole hierarchy of transparent hamiltonians with an arbitrary number of bound states .",
    "@xmath192 will appear as an intermediate hamiltonian between @xmath15 and @xmath189 .",
    "the process here should be similar to the one known in non- relativistic reflectionless operators @xcite .",
    "* the 2-twisted kink potential analyzed here is based on the specific choice of the seed states in . however , the stationary equation @xmath193 has two independent solutions for any @xmath48 . therefore ,",
    "other choices of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , corresponding to the same energies @xmath52 ( as linear combinations for example ) , would be possible as well .",
    "naturally , this would lead to different intertwining operators and to a new hamiltonian @xmath14 as well .",
    "* having in mind the two points above , it will be interesting to analyze more generic situation , e.g. the implementation darboux transformations in the context of time - dependent systems .",
    "it could generate the full , time dependent scattering solutions of the gn@xmath1 and njl@xmath1 models , as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this spirit , it would be intriguing to consider the meaning of time - dependent objects , i.e. breathers as pseudoscalar potentials , in the context of hidden symmetries .",
    "construction of exactly solvable dirac equations via darboux transformation ( [ l ] ) proves to be fruitful in various areas of physics .",
    "let us notice the recent results where solvable reflectionless models of twisted carbon nanotubes were constructed in this manner @xcite and discussed in the context of akns hierarchy @xcite . in this context , the exactly solvable hamiltonians ( [ htilde ] )",
    "can be interpreted as the effective hamiltonian of dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "the potential terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 then describe external magnetic field and an effective position - dependent mass , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ as an aditional application of darboux transformations , we showed that static transparent schrdinger hamiltonians can be derived as the square dirac static transparent ones .",
    "the approach presented here resembles the framework of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "there , the schrdinger hamiltonian is obtained as a square of the supercharge which is a first - order differential matrix operator with scalar potential @xmath194 .",
    "when @xmath194 solves one of the equations of the mkdv hierarchy ( and , hence , is transparent ) , then the diagonal elements @xmath195 of the potential @xmath196 of the schrdinger hamiltonian are also transparent and solve one of the equations of the kdv hierarchy . let us notice that in the context of integrable systems , the relation @xmath197 between the solution @xmath194 of mkdv hierarchy and the solutions @xmath195 of kdv hierarchy is known as miura transformation",
    ".    the matrix schrdinger hamiltonians studied here are extension of this scheme . here",
    ", we derive schrdinger hamiltonian with transparent potential as a square of dirac operator with a pseudo - scalar potential that solves the akns hierarchy .",
    "the construction also provides integrals of motion like @xmath198 that can be identified with the lax integral of motion of the matrix schrdinger hamiltonians . in this sense , these non - relativistic hamiltonians with matrix potentials can be treated as integrable .",
    "it is worth noticing that exact solvability of schrdinger operators with matrix potential was discussed in the context of shape - invariance in @xcite or @xcite , where the classification of these systems was presented .",
    "the shape invariance of dirac operators in the context of the darboux transformation ( [ l ] ) was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze whether schrdinger operators with the reflectionless matrix potentials can possess a wider set of ( dynamical ) symmetries .",
    "the works @xcite or @xcite where dynamical symmetries are considered for transparent pschl - teller potential could serve as a starting point in this direction .",
