    "for all thermodynamical systems , the macroscopic quantities have a fluctuation because of the statistical nature . according to the law of large numbers , the fluctuation is negligible for large system , which means the probability distribution concentrates near the expectation @xcite . but for small systems , the macroscopic quantity spreads in a wide range , which urges us to explore more on the distribution of the quantity .",
    "the probability distribution of the work done to the system under a certain process is usually referred as work function .",
    "work function , together with work fluctuation of small system have attracted much attention recently @xcite .",
    "work function also relates non - equilibrium qualities with the equilibrium ones @xcite .",
    "for example , jarzynski equality relates the non - equilibrium work @xmath0 with helmholtz free energy @xmath1 through @xmath2 . in such discussions ,",
    "the work fluctuation becomes a vital issue because it gives us information about the error in the estimation of @xmath3 in practice . therefore understanding the work function @xcite , as well as suppressing the corresponding work fluctuation are very important for small systems .",
    "researchers are making significant progress on work function .",
    "some recent researches @xcite compare the work function of adiabatic and non - adiabatic process under quantum scheme .",
    "results show that adiabatic process owns smaller work fluctuation .",
    "this result is not surprising , because adiabatic process will keep the population on each state invariant , or in other words , eliminate transitions between the eigenstates of the system .",
    "however , conventional adiabatic process requires the parameter changing slowly , and due to this reason , it will take a comparatively long time period in practice .",
    "thus one of our motivations is to speed up adiabatic process . to be more precise , in quantum case , we hope to eliminate the transition between states even if the parameter changes rapidly . and",
    "in classical case , we will keep the action variable , a classical analog of quantum number invariant as time evolves .",
    "we notice that in both cases , we are trying to accomplish a transitionless feature .",
    "based on the previous works of transitionless driving @xcite , we develop a method to achieved this goal in both quantum and classical cases by adding a control field to the system . with this approach",
    ", the system effectively undergoes an adiabatic process in a short time period , which is definitely a powerful tool for practical purpose .",
    "based on recent works on work function and jarzynski equality , we digest deeper on this topic , and use an extra driving field to achieve the so - called fast - forward adiabatic process . in the mean time , the fast - forward adiabatic process could retain all the features of the work function and work fluctuation of conventional adiabatic process with a carefully chosen control field .",
    "one amazing result is the estimation of @xmath3 converges much faster in practice with such control field .",
    "fast - forward adiabatic process also has potential applications in technology aspect .",
    "recent research on quantum otto engine @xcite is faced with choices between efficiency and output power . in the conventional scheme ,",
    "non - adiabatic cycles have smaller efficiency but larger output power , compared with adiabatic cycles .",
    "qualitatively , non - adiabatic cycles have larger work fluctuation thus might not be very efficient ; but they can be performed within arbitrarily short duration time , thus the output power could be very large .",
    "however , if we remember the previously mentioned remarkable features of our fast - forward adiabatic process , we realize that it minimizes the duration time and work fluctuation at the same time .",
    "follow the same logic , in later chapters we could see how our fast - forward adiabatic process helps the quantum engine to achieve the maximum efficiency and output power at the same time .    in the rest of this report",
    ", we will first review both quantum and classical adiabatic theorem in the second chapter , followed by the formal definitions and discussions on work function and work fluctuation in the third chapter . after that",
    ", we will introduce our original work on classical fast - forward adiabatic process , including the formal solution of control field and application in 1-d harmonic oscillator .",
    "work functions of adiabatic and non - adiabatic processes will be compared in analytical and numerical manner .",
    "next , for the quantum fast - forward adiabatic process , we will follow berrys approach of transitionless driving .",
    "furthermore , we will consider its work function and compare it with quantum non - adiabatic process in a similar way .",
    "last but not least , we will show some dramatic application of our fast - forward adiabatic process , including increasing the converging speed of @xmath3 and improving the performance of quantum engine .",
    "adiabatic process plays an important role in modern quantum mechanics . because of the population - invariant nature of adiabatic process",
    ", it is widely used in quantum optics and atomic physics in both theoretical @xcite@xcite and experimental aspect @xcite .",
    "besides that , there are some very fundamental signatures of a quantum system , for example , berrys phase , can only be described and measured when the system undergoes a cyclic adiabatic process .",
    "adiabatic theorem points out one way of realizing the adiabatic process .",
    "it tells us that a system usually undergoes an adiabatic process when the parameters of the system are changing slowly .",
    "thus slowly changing the parameters becomes the most common approach to adiabatic process .",
    "such approach will be referred as conventional adiabatic process in the rest of this article .    in this chapter",
    ", we will review both quantum and classical adiabatic theorem to explain why the changing rate of parameter matters . particularly for classical adiabatic theorem , before constructing fast - adiabatic process , we hope to introduce an unfamiliar tool called action - angle variables and make analog with the more familiar quantum version .",
    "we will illustrate the quantum adiabatic theorem for the system with only one time - dependent parameter .",
    "systems with more parameters are quite similar .    for such system , hamiltonian is represented by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time - dependent parameter .",
    "notice here we write it as @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "this is because in later chapters we will modify @xmath6 and hope the notations to be consistent with each other .",
    "the state at time @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 and instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath4 are given by @xmath10 the general solution of @xmath11 can be expanded using eigenstates of @xmath4 at time @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dynamical phase of state @xmath14 at @xmath8 .",

    "( [ c1coefficient ] ) becomes @xmath25 when @xmath26(compared with the level spacing @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 thus @xmath29 notice @xmath30 is purely imaginary , as @xmath31 , we immediately know @xmath32 , i.e. _ adiabatic approximation _ holds .",
    "this approximation means there is no transition between eigenstates of @xmath33 . and",
    "slowly changing parameter is the common approach .      in the previous derivations",
    ", we have shown that if @xmath34 changes slowly , adiabatic approximation holds , i.e. the probability of a state falling in a certain instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath4 is constant .",
    "this implies that there is no transition between states since probability is conserved .",
    "however , if the initial state to be a mixed state @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "if adiabatic approximation holds , it is easy to conclude that the state at time @xmath8 will be @xmath39 and the probability of falling in @xmath40 is a still constant . in other words , for an quantum ensemble undergoing quantum adiabatic process , the population on each energy level will not change as time evolves .    here",
    "we would like to distinguish the above quantum adiabatic process from the semistatic adiabatic process in thermodynamics . consider a gibbs canonical ensemble with partition function @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 thus a quantum adiabatic process turn the state into @xmath43 meanwhile , for a gibbs ensemble undergoing a seimistatic adiabatic process , the system is always in equilibrium , hence @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the partition function when parameter @xmath34 is @xmath5 . in general , since the energy level spacing between states is not fixed , @xmath46 , and the quantum adiabatic process discussed in the adiabatic theorem is not the equilibrium thermodynamical adiabatic process .",
    "the canonical ensemble in classical adiabatic theory encounters the same problem . in the rest of this article , when we use adiabatic process , we are actually referring to the adiabatic process described by either quantum or classical adiabatic theorem , rather than the equilibrium thermodynamical one .",
    "classical adiabatic theorem is based on a special set of canonical coordinates called action - angle variables . in this section",
    "we will start with canonical transformation , followed by a brief introduction about the mathematics of the action - angle variables .",
    "we will also make analogues between action variable and quantum number to clarify the relationship between classical and quantum adiabatic theorems .",
    "given a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath47 , let @xmath48 representing the system energy .",
    "the the action - angle is defined by @xmath49 the integral is integrated over a periodic @xmath50 . for a system has more degrees of freedom , the existence of such integral requires the system to be separable @xcite , hence action - angle variable might not exist for some systems .",
    "if action - angle variables exist , ( [ c1action ] ) implies that @xmath51 is independent of @xmath52 , @xmath53 notice that although @xmath54 and @xmath55 has the same value , they have different dependent variables , thus we use tilde to distinguish one from the other .",
    "the advantage of action - angle variable is , if the hamiltonian is time - independent ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 becomes our new hamiltonian under @xmath58 .",
    "remember @xmath57 is independent of @xmath52 , we have @xmath59 i.e. @xmath60 is constant as time evolves .",
    "now let us come back to the physical interpretation of @xmath60 .",
    "equation ( [ c1action ] ) reminds us of _ bohr - sommerfeld quantization _ in old quantum theory , which obeys @xmath61 where @xmath62 are quantum numbers in old quantum theory .",
    "a famous result is the quantization of angular momentum @xmath63 in bohr model , @xmath64    one important property of quantum adiabatic theorem is that an energy eigenstate remains on the corresponding instantaneous energy eigenstate of the system , or in other words , the quantum number @xmath65 is invariant .",
    "so it is quite natural to require @xmath66 in classical adiabatic theorem , when @xmath47 is changing slowly .      in order to derive classical adiabatic theorem",
    ", we need to know the new hamiltonian @xmath67 when the coordinate is changed from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "according to ( [ c1independent ] ) , when @xmath54 is time independent , @xmath70 , which could greatly simplify our calculation .",
    "however , to carry out the transformation under time - dependent @xmath47 , we need to find the so - called type - ii generating function @xmath71 @xcite . here",
    "we will skip this step , and show the subsequent steps .",
    "explicit example in 1-d harmonic oscillator will be shown in the next chapter .",
    "once we get the generating function @xmath71 , the relations between coordinates @xmath68 and@xmath69 are given by @xmath72 in principle , with the above equations , we can solve @xmath68 as functions of @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "in addition , we notice that if @xmath54 is time - independent , i.e. @xmath81 , equation ( [ c1idot ] ) is reduced to @xmath82 , which is consistent with ( [ c1independent ] ) .",
    "in fact , the classical adiabatic theorem requires one more step .",
    "this step is used to guarantee when @xmath83 , ( [ c1idot ] ) does not result in significant change of @xmath60 as time accumulates . to prove this ,",
    "we actually require @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the inherent angular frequency of the system .",
    "an complete deviation will be given in goldsteins textbook @xcite .",
    "work function is an important concept for small systems .",
    "it is defined as the probability distribution of the work done to the system during a certain process .",
    "one may be wondering why there is distribution of work . as we know , in general , for a thermodynamical system , the macroscopic quantities have fluctuations .",
    "however , due to the large number of particles ( @xmath86 ) in large systems , the fluctuation is negligible , and the probability distribution of the macroscopic quantities is quite close to a @xmath87-function .",
    "but the case is quite different for small systems .",
    "for example , for a canonical ensemble , the ratio between the fluctuation and average of the system energy is given @xcite by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the particles in the system .",
    "for a system whose @xmath89 is large enough , the fluctuation is negligible . in contrary , for small systems , the macroscopic quantity spreads in a wide range . in order to describe the work precisely , we need to take work distribution and work fluctuation into consideration .",
    "this chapter mainly discusses the work function and work fluctuation .",
    "we will introduce work function under both classical and quantum scheme . in each section",
    ", we will first give the definition of work and the general form of work function .",
    "at last we will briefly introduce jarzynski equality .      before defining the work function ,",
    "we should make it clear what is the work done to the system in classical mechanics .",
    "in this project we will follow jarzynski approach of inclusive work @xcite@xcite .",
    "notice we always assume the system is not in contact with heat reservoir during the whole process , so the work is simply the energy difference of final and initial state .",
    "assume time @xmath8 varies from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , and hamiltonian @xmath92 is given , then in principle we could solve for the trajectory of the system , @xmath93 here the system is not restricted to 2 degrees of freedom , and @xmath94 can have arbitrary many components . given any initial condition @xmath95 of the system , during the action time @xmath91 of the process , work @xmath0 can be worked out as a function @xmath96 of @xmath95 , @xmath97 this equation is totally deterministic . for the system to have fluctuation on work @xmath0 , the initial condition must be given in the form of classical ensemble @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath98 is the probability distribution of initial condition in phase space .",
    "then the probability density @xmath99 of work satisfies @xmath100 or equivalently , @xmath101 @xmath102 is the dirac - delta function , and @xmath103 under the integral means that the integration is performed over the entire phase space @xmath103 .      for quantum ensemble ,",
    "the case is slightly different .",
    "let @xmath104 be the eigenenergies of the system at @xmath105 , similarly for @xmath106 .",
    "first consider a system starts with a pure state @xmath107 , there are several final states the system might fall in .",

    "furthermore , we know the relation between helmholtz free energy and partition function , @xmath126 plug into ( [ c3interjar ] ) , and jarzynski equality emerges , @xmath127 this equation is very powerful in the sense that it relates non - equilibrium quality @xmath0 with equilibrium quality @xmath1 , with regardless of work function @xmath99 . in practical aspect , if we want to measure the free energy difference between two equilibrium state , we only need to prepare the gibbs canonical ensemble , randomly pick a sample from it , and change the parameter @xmath34 from @xmath128 to @xmath129 ( might be very fast ) .",
    "we do not even need to wait for the final state turning to equilibrium . as",
    "if we repeat such non - equilibrium process for enough times and measure the work done during the process , we could estimate @xmath130 through jarzynski equality .",
    "for example , if we hope to measure the free energy increase when the length of a protein is changed @xmath131 , a conventional way is stretching the protein very slowly , so that the process can be regarded as semi - static .",
    "such process costs much time . but with jarzynski equality , we need only to stretch the protein by length @xmath131 and measure the work @xmath0 in this process .",
    "average of @xmath132 will give us estimation of @xmath130 .",
    "however , we notice that ( [ c3jar ] ) only contains information about the average , and it does not tell us information on work fluctuation .",
    "for some system , the work fluctuation might be very large , and the expectation value @xmath3 converges slowly .",
    "later we will show how fast - forward adiabatic process helps @xmath3 to converge faster , by shrinking the work fluctuation .",
    "in the introduction chapters we have briefly discussed the pros and cons of the conventional adiabatic process .",
    "conventional adiabatic process suppresses the work fluctuation significantly according to lutz @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it takes comparatively longer time since parameter must change slowly enough .",
    "so far there is no literal discussion focused on overcoming such difficulty in classical cases .",
    "however , our pioneering work on fast - forward adiabatic process fills in this gap .",
    "it does not only boost up the speed , but also suppresses the work fluctuation compare with non - adiabatic process with the same speed .",
    "this chapter will explain the details of our original work in classical theory .",
    "this chapter is aimed to show how to guarantee action @xmath60 invariant even if the parameter changes fast .",
    "basically we will ensure this by adding a control field @xmath133 onto the original hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "an explicit example of 1-d classical harmonic oscillator will be shown for different processes .",
    "we will then compare their work functions , hence show how the control field @xmath133 suppresses the work fluctuation of a gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "simulation results will also be shown at the end of the chapter .",
    "assume we have obtained the type - ii generating function @xmath134 , we can immediately get the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath58 . according to ( [ c1k ] ) and ( [ c1idot ] ) @xmath135\\biggr|_{q = q(i,\\theta,\\lambda ) } \\label{c2k}\\ ] ] and @xmath136\\biggr|_{q = q(i,\\theta,\\lambda))}\\right)\\biggr|_i\\approx 0 ,   \\label{c2idot}\\ ] ] when @xmath137 adiabatic approximation holds . however , if @xmath138 is not negligible , ( [ c2idot ] ) is the only term term which might change the value of @xmath60 .",

    "our method of speeding up the adiabatic process ( keep @xmath60 constant ) is very straight forward .",

    "second one is that it allows adiabatic process to be performed arbitrarily fast , which saves much time in practice . in this chapter",

    "so if the work fluctuation is very large , converging rate of @xmath3 might be very slow . in such cases , if we add the control field @xmath133 , the non - equilibrium process can be completed with smaller work fluctuation and within the same time .",

    "the quantum engine we are going to discuss is based on otto cycle considered by lutz @xcite .",
    "we suppose the system is a previously discussed quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the cycle consists of four consecutive steps as shown in [ fig : otto ] .",
    "suppose the start point @xmath292 is a gibbs canonical ensemble .",
    "isentropic compression @xmath293 .",
    "the angular frequency is increased during time @xmath294 , and the system is isolated from any heat reservoir .",
    "the time - evolution is unitary , thus the von neumann entropy is constant .",
    "notice @xmath295 is no longer an equilibrium state , thus we use @xmath296 instead of exact temperature .",
    "hot isochore @xmath297",
    ". the angular frequency of the system is fixed , and meanwhile the system is weakly coupled with a heat reservoir at @xmath298 .",

    "isentropic expansion @xmath300 .",

    "cold isochore @xmath303 .",
    "similar to 2 .",
    "time duration is @xmath304 .",
    "the authors consider two cases under classical limit : angular frequency in 1 and 3 is changed slowly ( conventional adiabatic limit ) or fast ( sudden change limit ) , and then consider the efficiency at maximum average output for a cycle . here",
    ", for convenience we assume the oscillator is actually a classical one .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the results of both classical oscillator and quantum oscillator under classical limit turn out to be the same .",
    "it is not surprising that classical and quantum process share the same work function under classical limit @xmath305 .",
    "second , many bio - motors are actually classical engines as they are under room temperature , which will kill most quantum effects . thus it is reasonable to apply the results of classical fast - forward adiabatic process to quantum engines under classical limit .",
    "we first calculate the adiabatic limit case .",
    "average energy of state @xmath306 is @xmath307 , which is obvious . and by ( [ c21drho ] ) ,",
    "the average work done in 1 is @xmath308 .",
    "thus average energy of state @xmath295 is @xmath309 .",
    "since @xmath310 , the heat received from hight - temperature reservoir is @xmath311 .",
    "we could get @xmath312 in the similar way .",
    "thus the average work done in one cycle is @xmath313 noting the total time is @xmath314 , and output @xmath315 .",
    "the tricky part is , @xmath316 are dominant , because 1 and 3 are adiabatic process . therefore minimizing total work in one cycle is actually maximizing the output .",
    "after simple mathematics , we find the maximum power occurs at @xmath317 .",
    "the efficiency at maximum output is given by @xmath318 the power adiabatic limit is very low since @xmath316 tends to infinity .",
    "the sudden limit case is quite similar . using ( [ c4suddenwork ] ) @xmath319 , and @xmath320 .",
    "then @xmath321 , and @xmath322 .",
    "this time , under sudden change limit , total time is @xmath323 as @xmath324 .",
    "we further assume @xmath323 is approximately constant for any combination of @xmath325 .",
    "this is reasonable as they are system relaxation time .",
    "so minimizing total work @xmath326 gives us @xmath327{\\beta_1/\\beta_2}$ ] . and efficiency at maximum output is @xmath328 the power of sudden change is much bigger than adiabatic limit , but the efficiency is less than half of @xmath329 .      in previous section we show that designers of quantum engine have to choose between efficiency and work output : sudden change provides higher output while conventional adiabatic process provides higher efficiency .",
    "now lets apply our fast - forward adiabatic process to 1 and 3 .",
    "obviously the efficiency at maximum output should be the same for both conventional and fast - forward adiabatic process , since they share the same work function , expectation and fluctuation , etc .",
    "but the output can be improved up to @xmath330 because the fast - forward process can be performed arbitrarily fast .",
    "next compare it with the sudden change limit .",
    "we know the efficiency is improved more than twice , how about the output power ?",
    "for fast - forward adiabatic process , maximum power occurs at @xmath317 , the absolute value of total work is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    for sudden change , maximum power is at @xmath327{\\beta_1/\\beta_2}$ ] , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    which means fast - forward adiabatic process doubles both the efficiency and output if we assume @xmath323 is constant .",
    "besides the output and efficiency issue , there are other advantages of fast - forward adiabatic process . quantum engine ,",
    "as the name suggests , is engine work on small scale system . due to the size of the system ,",
    "the fluctuation is not negligible .",
    "large work fluctuation , especially negative work in quantum non - adiabatic work function , might lead to a fluctuated output .",
    "however , quite uniform output of a heat engine is always one important industrial requirement , and fast - forward adiabatic process suppresses the fluctuation , i.e. provides a much more uniform output .",
    "in this report , we discuss the fast - forward adiabatic process , particularly its effect in suppressing the work fluctuation in details .",
    "we review both the classical and quantum adiabatic theorems , which describe the slowly changing feature of the conventional adiabatic process .",
    "we emphasize and rigorously define the work function of small system , as well as the work fluctuation .    in classical aspect ,",
    "we construct our original control field under the most general condition , which could turn a non - adiabatic process into a fast - forward process .",
    "we calculate an explicit example in a time - dependent harmonic oscillator to illustrate how to construct the control field analytically .",
    "numerical and simulated results are performed in order to compare the work functions of different processes .    in quantum aspect",
    ", we follow the works of berry and lutz on transitionless driving and non - adiabatic process .",
    "we make our contribution by comparing them .",
    "we propose to use control field to make a fast non - adiabatic process adiabatic , which effectively suppresses the work fluctuation .",
    "we verify our arguments again using a time - dependent harmonic oscillator example .",
    "the toy model also reveals physical intrinsics , for example , how the quantum nature affects the work function .",
    "based on our formalism and examples in fast - forward adiabatic process , we conjecture that the work fluctuation argument holds in general , which is resulted from the nature of adiabatic assumption .",
    "there are many applications of the fast - forward adiabatic processes . in this report",
    "we only briefly touch two of them .",
    "the first one is the jarzynski equality which links the thermo - average of the work function and the change of free energy .",
    "using fast - forward adiabatic processes , the equality converges much faster .",
    "the second application is a quantum engine based on an otto cycle .",
    "the application of fast - forward adiabatic processes not only maximizes the power output by speeding up the otto cycle , but also increases the efficiency of the engine .    the results in this report can be easily realized in models other than the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , for example , the two - level system .",
