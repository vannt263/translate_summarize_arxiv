    "a galactic nucleus is a region where various astrophysical phenomena co - exist .",
    "thanks to the high resolution images provided by the hubble space telescope , it is clear , nowadays , that the nuclei of the majority of elliptical and early type spiral galaxies ( with mass @xmath5 ) harbor massive and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) @xcite",
    ". smbhs have masses from @xmath6 , up to the extreme case of the galaxy ngc1277 , which hosts a smbh with mass @xmath7 m@xmath2 @xcite , although this mass estimation is very uncertain @xcite .    in some cases",
    ", the smbh is surrounded by a nuclear star cluster ( nsc ) , a massive and dense stellar system composed of up to @xmath8 stars @xcite .",
    "in general , fainter galaxies host a nsc without evidence of the presence of a central massive black hole .",
    "hence , it seems that there is a continuos sequence from nsc - dominated galaxies to smbh - dominated galaxies @xcite . due to this , smbhs and nscs",
    "are often indifferently referred to as compact massive objects ( cmos ) .",
    "nscs are observed in galaxies of any type in the hubble sequence @xcite and their channels of formation and evolution are still matter of debate .",
    "what we know , at present , is that nscs are very massive ( @xmath9 m@xmath2 ) @xcite , with a half - light radius of @xmath10 pc @xcite , and much more luminous ( @xmath114 mag ) than ordinary galactic gcs .    generally , nscs contain both an old stellar population , age @xmath12 gyr , and a younger one , with ages below @xmath13 myr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nscs are located at the photometric and kinematic centre of their host galaxy , i.e. at the bottom of its potential well @xcite .    small sizes and large masses",
    "make nscs the densest stellar systems observed in the universe @xcite .",
    "two are the most popular , and debated , formation scenarios :    * the one commonly referred to as `` _ _ in - situ model _ _ '' , relies upon several injections of gas that accretes onto the central smbh , leading to the formation and growth of a nsc @xcite ; * the scenario which is usually known as `` _ _ dry - merger scenario _ _ '' . in this case , the main engine is the action of dynamical friction that causes the sink of massive gcs toward the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "decaying clusters merge in the central galactic region leading to the formation , and subsequent growth , of a nsc .",
    "this formation channel has been studied by several authors , through @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "currently , it is very difficult to discriminate between the two presented formation scenarios .",
    "however , the existence of scaling relations between the cmos and their host galaxies may provide additional clues on the modes of growth and evolution of nscs and smbhs .    in particular @xcite provided a power law relation between the nsc mass , @xmath14 , and the host velocity dispersion , @xmath15 , that is @xmath16 .",
    "the in - situ model reproduces fairly well this correlation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a more recent analysis based on larger datasets , provided a shallower power law relation , with exponent between @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite ; this shallower relation is in good agreement with the predictions of the dry - merger model @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of nscs is that they are very rare in galaxies with masses @xmath19m@xmath2 .",
    "these galaxies have luminosity profiles that do not show observational evidences of a central excess , which is widely considered a clear signature of the presence of a nsc @xcite .",
    "various hypotheses have been raised to explain the observed absence of a nucleated region in massive galaxies .",
    "for instance , giant elliptical galaxies are thought to be the merging product of smaller galaxies . in this framework , if two colliding galaxies contain both a smbh and a nsc , the central region of the merger product should borrow a smbh binary , that may heat the surrounding nucleus , inducing its evaporation @xcite .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the central smbh prevents the nsc formation by tidally destroying its `` building blocks '' , i.e. the decaying star clusters @xcite . as a consequence of the tidal stripping exerted on the decaying clusters ,",
    "it is also possible that the newly born nsc is too small and , thus , very hard to detect through the analysis of the galactic luminosity profile .    on the other hand ,",
    "as suggested recently by @xcite , the tidal action of a smbh seems insufficient to quench the formation of nscs in galaxies containing smbhs with masses similar ( or less than ) that of the milky way .    combining the scaling relations that link nscs and smbhs with their host galaxies",
    ", it is found that the smbh mass threshold over which galaxies do not show any evidence for a nucleated region roughly corresponds to the condition @xmath20 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "no nscs are observed in galaxies harboring very massive bhs at their centres ; this could be the indication of a physical connection between the presence of nscs and the smbhs .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the tidal action exerted by a smbh and by the galactic region in which it moves , on an infalling gc , which is supposed to be one of the building blocks of a nsc .",
    "the main aim of this research is understanding whether the tidal disruption process can inhibit the formation of a nsc or , at least , limit its mass ( and luminosity ) below an observationally detectable value .",
    "to reach such a goal , we performed a set of direct @xmath0-body simulations of the inner region of a galaxy containing a central smbh and an orbiting gc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present and discuss how we modelled the host galaxy and the gc , and the initial conditions selected for the simulations ; our results are presented in section [ sec3 ] and discussed in section [ sec4 ] . finally , in section [ sec5",
    "] , we draw the conclusions of this work .",
    "using a series of high - precision , direct @xmath0-body simulations , we modelled the orbital decay of a single gc traversing the inner region of a galaxy containing a smbh , whose mass is tightly correlated with the galaxy mass .",
    "we varied the smbh and galaxy mass , in order to highlight how their tidal action influences the infall process of the gc .",
    "in particular , we aim to shed light on which is the dominant process in shaping the inner region of galaxies : the dynamical friction , which drags gcs toward the galactic centre , making the formation of a nsc easier , or the tidal heating mechanism , which favours the disruption of the infalling gcs .",
    "a one - to - one @xmath0-body modelling of an entire galaxy requires an exceedingly large number of particles ( @xmath21 for a typical galaxy ) .",
    "nowadays , the state - of - the - art of direct @xmath0-body simulations limits such number to @xmath22 .    in order to keep the number of particles reasonably low without altering the correct behaviour of the system , avoiding spurious relaxation effects and ensuring a sufficient phase - space resolution",
    ", we restricted our model to a limited spatial region of the galaxy . to generate a dynamically stable model of the spatial region of interest",
    ", we adopted a truncated density profile , that , as suggested by @xcite , has the form    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the hyperbolic cosine function , @xmath25 is the truncation distance , that we assume @xmath26 pc , and @xmath27 belongs to the class of the so - called @xcite profiles :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the galaxy mass , @xmath30 is its length scale and @xmath31 gives the inner slope of the density profile .",
    "the density models considered in this paper have @xmath31 in the range @xmath32 $ ] . in particular , we selected @xmath31 in order to obtain a good compromise between the reliability of the galaxy model and the resolution of its @xmath0-body sampling . following this strategy , we used more than @xmath33 particles to model the infalling gc , allowing a reliable description of its internal dynamics .    for the purposes of this work , we sampled 4 galaxy models with mass in the range @xmath34m@xmath35m@xmath2 .",
    "the mass of the smbh hosted at the centre of the galaxy was set according to the scaling relation provided by @xcite :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "table [ simula ] summarises the main parameters that characterise our galactic representations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     column 1 : mass of the host galaxy .",
    "column 2 : distance of the gc from the smbh after the completion of the orbital decay process .",
    "column 3 : mass percentage which is still bound to the gc at the end of the simulation .",
    "[ masslos ]      given the definition of orbital eccentricity as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the apocentric distance , after the circular ( @xmath41 ) , we investigated also eccentric ( @xmath42 ) and radial ( @xmath43 ) orbits to understand how the orbital type influences the transport of matter toward the galactic centre influencing the process of formation of a stellar nucleus therein .    in the case of radial orbits ,",
    "the cluster is placed at @xmath44 pc from the smbh with zero initial velocity , while eccentric orbits are characterized by the gc starting at @xmath45 with an initial velocity @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the circular velocity at the galactocentric distance @xmath45 .",
    "the direction of the initial velocity is orthogonal to the radius vector , leading to an eccentricity @xmath48 .    in these eccentric cases",
    ", the analysis of the gc structure is complicated in models with @xmath49 , due to the difficulty to distinguish a clear centre and boundary for the gc after its first passage at pericentre .",
    "figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] show some snapshots of the gc orbital evolution for eccentric and radial orbits in the case @xmath50 m@xmath2 . in the case",
    "@xmath51 , it is worth noting that at every passage at pericentre some stars are stripped away from the gc and tend to move on precessing ellipses whose semi - major axes increase with the number of passages at pericentre . on the other hand , when the gc experiences an `` head - on '' collision with the smbh , stars are scattered backward at different velocities , depending on the impact parameter that characterises each star - smbh interaction .",
    "this peculiar interaction leads to the formation of a wake behind the former gc , with a structure similar to the propagation of a wave on a water plate .",
    "therefore , although it is quite difficult to identify the `` core '' of the gc , the interaction between an smbh and an infalling gc produces debris that hides much informations about the initial orbital parameters of the gc .    however , due to the fact that it is almost impossible to identify a centre for the cluster in these cases , we limited our analysis to the estimate of the amount of gc mass which remains confined to an inner region of the galaxy , around the smbh .",
    "when considering the simulations with @xmath52m@xmath2 , we found that eccentric and radial orbits allow a more efficient transport of mass , toward the galactic centre , than circular orbits do . on these orbits",
    ", the gc can carry about @xmath53 of its initial mass to the galactic centre , while , on circular orbits , such percentage is limited to few @xmath54 . on the other hand , for lower galaxy masses , @xmath55m@xmath2",
    ", we found that the major contribution to the deposited mass comes from gc on circular orbits .",
    "we will deepen the discussion about these results in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented several @xmath0-body simulations to study the interaction between a single gc and a smbh in the galactic centre . the results shed light on the actual mechanisms of mass accumulation in the central region of a massive galaxy ( @xmath56 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "figure [ f14a ] shows the gc cumulative mass profile as a function of the distance from the smbh after the orbital decay process , for all the orbits considered and in the case of @xmath57m@xmath2 and @xmath58m@xmath2 .",
    "considering our lightest galaxy model , we found that circular and radial orbits are both efficient in the transport of mass toward the galactic centre .",
    "in such cases , the mass left to the galactic centre exceeds @xmath59 of the initial mass of the gc . on the other hand , in heavier galaxy models , only gcs moving on initial nearly - radial orbits deposit a non negligible amount of their mass ( @xmath60 of the initial mass of the gc ) in the inner @xmath61 pc of the galaxy .",
    "hence , the fraction of mass deposited within @xmath61 pc from the smbh varies from few percent , for the heaviest galaxy model , to more than @xmath62 in the lightest .",
    "m@xmath2 ( top panel ) , and @xmath63 m@xmath2 ( bottom panel ) . in each panel ,",
    "the various lines refer to gc orbits of the intial eccentricity labeled on top.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +   m@xmath2 ( top panel ) , and @xmath63 m@xmath2 ( bottom panel ) . in each panel ,",
    "the various lines refer to gc orbits of the intial eccentricity labeled on top.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    we have shown that the mass deposition around the galactic centres is not efficient in galaxies with masses above @xmath64m@xmath2 .",
    "however , we can not exclude that such ( unefficient ) mechanism may , eventually , drive the formation of a detectable , central overdensity . in order to address this point",
    ", we tried to reconstruct the projected , combined density profile of the host galaxy and its orbitally decayed gcs .    to do this ,",
    "we consider a population of @xmath65 clusters whose orbits are evenly distributed among circular , eccentric ( @xmath48 ) and radial .    under the ( extreme ) assumption of `` linearity '' of the decay process",
    ", we can evaluate the global density profile as the mere sum of the density profile of the galaxy , @xmath66 , and of the decayed clusters : @xmath67 where @xmath68 represent the fraction of gcs with initial eccentricity @xmath69 . in the following calculations",
    ", we used @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that the detectability of a nucleus through the analysis of the projected density profiles depends on the resolution of the instrument used to look at the target galaxy and the distance of the target itself . due to this , in figure [ denpro ] we assumed the host galaxy at the distance of the virgo cluster ( taken as @xmath74 mpc @xcite ) , where a quite large number of nscs have been detected over time @xcite .",
    "generally , the presence of a nsc in a galactic centre is argued by the presence of a clear edge in the projected inner luminosity profile of the host galaxy .",
    "hence , a parameter that can be used to discriminate wheter or not a nsc resides in the centre of a galaxy is the surface density contrast @xmath75 between the total ( galaxy+gc ) and the galactic background .",
    "we found that in our simulations the surface density contrast is related to the number of orbitally segregated clusters , @xmath76 , with @xmath77 .",
    "galaxies with a clearly visible nucleated region have typical values @xmath78 @xcite . on the base of our simulations",
    "we deduce that such values can be achieved only when more than @xmath13 clusters with masses @xmath79 m@xmath2 reach the galactic centre within a hubble time .",
    "consequently , the missing evidence of nscs in a galaxy of mass @xmath63m@xmath2 would mean that in such galaxy there have not been enough gcs to merge and form it .",
    "this result agrees with previous findings by @xcite indicating that in a galaxy with that mass the number of clusters which can decay and contribute to the formation of a nucleus is less than @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the disruptive mechanism proposed here represents a satisfactory alternative to other theories , such as the disruption of pre - existing nscs after a major merger event , or the tidal heating caused by a massive bh binary at the centre of the host galaxy .",
    "it is worth highlighting that our proposed mechanism requires only two ingredients , well supported by theoretical and observational arguments , that are : i ) the presence of a smbh within the galactic centre , and ii ) the presence of a populations of star clusters around it .",
    "moreover , it involves time - scales which are significantly shorter than those expected for galaxy merging and bhb formation .    ) as labelled . , width=302 ]",
    "the simulation of the interaction of the gc with the central massive galactic black hole showed an interesting side effect : after the fly - by around perigalacticon , a certain amount of stars are extracted from the gc and some of them even from the galaxy , on a privileged direction along the gc trajectory .    in the galaxy hosting the most massive bh , @xmath81 m@xmath2 , after the passage at perigalacticon , some stars in the gc gain velocities up to @xmath82 kms@xmath83 .",
    "a fraction of them leave the galaxy reaching distances up to @xmath84 kpc in @xmath85 myr and ( nearly constant ) residual velocities up to @xmath86 kms@xmath83 .",
    "we performed a careful investigation to check whether it was a real effect or due to errors related to the numerical integration .",
    "this was done comparing the simulation results with those coming from extremely accurate integrations ( although with a reduced number of particles ) performed using a serial , fully regularized version of our n - body code , where regularization is applied to the whole set of pair interactions .",
    "its use allowed us to keep the variation of the total mechanical energy of the system below @xmath87 .",
    "this code employs the mikkola s algorithmic regularization @xcite , coupled with the chain algorithm , in order to handle efficiently very large particle mass ratios , like those we have in this work ( massive black hole respect to the star mass ) .",
    "results of this code ( applied to a subsample of objects ) confirmed that the effect was real and not a numerical artifact .",
    "actually , we simulated the orbital evolution of the gc in the case @xmath81 m@xmath2 . since our fully regularized , serial ,",
    "@xmath0-body is hugely time consuming , we simulated only the first passage at the pericentre of our gc , sampled with @xmath88 particles .",
    "we found that the fraction of stars that leave the cluster and their velocities agree very well with the values obtained in the `` extended '' case .",
    "it is worth noting that the escape velocity from the whole system , evaluated in our most massive model at perigalacticon , is , in our most massive model , @xmath89 kms@xmath83 , while the escape velocity from the cluster is @xmath90 kms@xmath83 .",
    "hence , a fraction of the total number of stars are possible candidate as escapers , i.e. as stars energetically unbound from the galaxy and the gc .    in figure [ f7 ] we present some snapshots of the gc moving in the @xmath63m@xmath2 galaxy on the @xmath48 orbit , through its first perigalacticon passage , marking in color the escaping stars .",
    "after the passage at the pericentre , stars flow away through the lagrangian point l2 , along the direction tangential to the gc trajectory .",
    "therefore , the ejection occurs on a preferential direction , leading the escapers to move in a sort of `` collimated beam '' .",
    "we identified as escapers from the galaxy those stars that both i ) get a positive mechanical energy in the inertial system of reference , and ii ) reach galactocentric distances exceeding @xmath91 times the truncation radius of our galaxy model , thus making extremely implausible a recapture . using this procedure , we identified 362 escaping stars in the galaxy hosting the @xmath92 m@xmath2 massive bh , that is @xmath93 of the total number of stars of the gc .",
    "scaling this number to the total number of stars of a realistic gc , say @xmath1 stars , we obtain a population of @xmath94 stars , formerly belonging to the gc , which wander in the outer region of the galaxy , with velocities in the range @xmath95 kms@xmath83 and positive total energy .",
    "figure [ f122 ] shows the velocity distribution of the whole population of escaping stars .",
    "myr after the gc passage at perigalacticon for a cluster containing @xmath1 stars .",
    "all the stars in the plot have distance from the galaxy centre larger then @xmath96 kpc .",
    "the black line indicates a gaussian fit with mean value @xmath97 km s@xmath83 and dispersion @xmath98 km s@xmath83.,width=302 ]    we found that the escapers have residual velocity up to @xmath99 km s@xmath83 , a value comparable to the velocities of high - velocity stars detected in the milky - way @xcite , but definitively smaller than that of the hyper - velocity stars , whose velocities can exceed @xmath100 km s@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that most of the high - velocity stars observed in our galaxy are located in a preferential region , near the galactic north pole .",
    "of course , this anistropic distribution may hidden some clues related to their origin .",
    "intriguingly , we notice here that the interaction between an infalling gc and a smbh seems to represent a significant channel of formation of high - velocity stars , producing a collimated beam of stars that , in a certain fraction , can even escape from the host galaxy .",
    "hence , this channel deserve further investigations @xcite .",
    "likely , the correct interpretation of the velocity gain is by mean of a 3-body interaction among the gc , the smbh and the generic star of the cluster .",
    "the basic concept , recently developed in @xcite , is that some stars of the cluster during its fly - by around the smbh gain enough kinetic energy , subtracted to the gc - smbh pair , to be expelled from the gc and even from the galaxy .",
    "figure [ 3body ] shows the velocity vector of one of the escaping stars in simulation @xmath63 m@xmath2 , as it moves around its gc , which , in its turn , is moving around the smbh . after the passage at pericentre ,",
    "it is evident that the star , which is behind the gc with respect to the gc - smbh direction , is accelerated and thrown away along the direction tangential to the gc orbit .",
    "this 3-body mechanism is similar to the interaction between the smbh and a binary star proposed by @xcite , but in this case the `` primary '' member of the binary is the whole gc , or at least the fraction of the cluster mass enclosed within the trajectory of the `` secondary '' ( the future escaping star ) . using the parallelism with the treatment of @xcite , later revisited by @xcite and @xcite , we can give a rough estimate of the ejection velocities of stars gaining kinetic energy at distance @xmath101 from the gc center , that , in the case of a gc plummer profile gives    @xmath102    which maximizes for @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the profile scale length . during the passage at pericentre ,",
    "the gc half - mass radius for our model is @xmath105 . for a plummer sphere , @xmath106 ; therefore , for our gc model @xmath107 pc , value very close to the peak of the velocity distribution in one of our @xmath0-body simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ rhysto ] ) which can be considered quite representative of simulations presented in this paper .",
    "km s@xmath83 .",
    "the distribution , fitted with a gaussian distribution , peaks at @xmath108 pc.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper we gave an interpretation of the observed dearth of nscs in massive host galaxies .",
    "the problem was studied by performing several high - precision , direct , @xmath0-body simulations of the orbital decay of a massive gc in a galaxy harboring a central smbh . to run our simulations we employed the ` higpus ` code @xcite .",
    "these simulations allowed us to quantify the combined role of dynamical friction and of tidal forces on the cluster along its motion .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * in all the cases studied ( different masses for the host galaxy and for the central black hole , different initial orbits for the `` test '' gc , as summarized in table [ simula ] ) , we found that the main contribution to the `` tidal heating '' of the cluster was given by the central smbh , accompanied by a less relevant and slower erosion caused by the stellar galactic background ; * in galaxies below @xmath109m@xmath2 , the cluster transports to the galactic centre more than @xmath59 of its initial mass , regardless of the shape of the initial orbit . on the other side",
    ", in heavier galaxies we showed that the mass deposited to the central galactic region by the cluster on the nearly radial orbit is limited to @xmath53 of its initial mass , while the cluster moving on the initially circular orbit is almost completely disrupted after its first crossing of the galactic centre , thus giving a negligible contribution to the formation of a bright nucleus therein ; * by means of scaling arguments we showed that in galaxies more massive than @xmath109m@xmath2 the formation of a clearly detectable stellar projected overdensity ( a nsc ) should occur only when the total mass of the decayed clusters ( of the size and with the characteristics studied in this paper ) is @xmath3m@xmath2 , an order of magnitude above the value expected from observational and theoretical arguments .",
    "* in the case of gc eccentric and radial orbits we found that , as the cluster passes through the perigalacticon in the case @xmath63m@xmath2 , a small quantity of the cluster stars is `` thrown '' away from the galactic centre reaching distances above @xmath110 kpc with residual velocities up to @xmath99 kms@xmath83 .",
    "a fraction of these stars reach velocities such to become unbound from the galaxy .",
    "rescaling these results to a real globular cluster , with @xmath79 stars , this corresponds to more than @xmath111 escapers .",
    "the anisotropy in the escapers distribution and the velocities that they gained suggest that this sort of 3-body mechanism ( gc+smbh+star orbiting the gc ) is a valid mode of formation of high - velocity stars .",
    "this deduction finds a nice confirmation in that the velocity distribution of the escapings stars in our @xmath0-body simulations peaks for stars receiving the kick when they transit at a distance from the gc center equal to the plummer length scale of the analytical model on which we based our 3-body considerations , following the original @xcite approach .",
