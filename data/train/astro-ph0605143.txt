    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) exo  0748676 was discovered in 1985 as a transient x - ray source @xcite and rapidly associated with an optical counterpart , uy  vol  @xcite . unlike most x - ray transients , however",
    ", it did not decay back to a quiescent state , but remained active and is now considered part of the persistent lmxb population .",
    "this makes it an intriguing object for study as it appears to exist near the edge of stability , flipping between phases of quasi - stable activity and quiescence .",
    "the likely key to its behavior is that the system is currently held in a meta - stable high state by i ) stabilization of the accretion disk against thermal instability by x - ray irradiation and ii ) enhancement of the mass transfer rate from the companion .",
    "uy  vol  is thus an important object for understanding the impact of x - ray irradiation upon the disk and companion star in lmxbs .",
    "uy  vol  also has an inclination that is just right to give us a range of diagnostic tools to probe the accretion flow .",
    "the inclination is high enough that x - ray eclipses are seen recurring on a 3.82hr period , and x - ray dips also occur @xcite .",
    "the eclipses are sharp , indicating that the neutron star itself is being eclipsed , and hence that it is visible outside of eclipse .",
    "uy  vol  is therefore not an accretion disk corona ( adc ) source ; an adc is likely present , but is not the dominant source of observed x - rays .    to better understand the accretion structure and effect of irradiation in this lmxb",
    ", we have performed a multiwavelength study using _ hst_for uv rapid spectroscopy , _ rxte _  for x - ray data , gemini - s for rapid optical photometry , and the cerro tololo 4 m blanco telescope for optical spectroscopy .",
    "we discuss here the analysis of several x - ray bursts seen during the simultaneous coverage .",
    "subsequent papers will address the uv and optical emission line spectra ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) , and the spectral energy distribution , and multiwavelength orbital light curves ( paper iii ) .",
    "type i x - ray bursts , seen in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with neutron star primaries , are due to explosive thermonuclear burning of accreted material on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "they involve a large increase in the x - ray flux , by a factor of ten or more , on timescales of a few seconds . as well as",
    "providing insights into the conditions on the surface of the neutron star , the sudden flash lights up the whole binary system , and significant reprocessed bursts , with an amplitude of a factor of a few , are seen in the optical ( see @xcite and references therein ) . since the reprocessed bursts are a large amplitude signal rather than a small perturbation , the non - linearity of the optical response ( due to observing band - limited rather than bolometric fluxes ) is clear .",
    "thus lightcurves in different bandpasses exhibit significant differences , breaking the degeneracy between the temperature and emitting area of the reprocessing region that exists when only small perturbations are considered @xcite .",
    "this makes the bursts a very powerful tool for applying echo mapping techniques in an x - ray binary ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in spite of this potential , the unpredictable nature of the bursts",
    "means that relatively few simultaneous observations exist of any x - ray bursting source , many twenty years old , and no uv observations of bursts have been obtained .",
    "we present here the first simultaneous x - ray , uv , and optical observations of a burst in uy  vol , including fast far - uv spectroscopy .",
    "we also present several more bursts observed with only x - ray and optical coverage .",

    "timetag mode yielded a stream of detected events , with 125@xmath1s precision , which could be used to reconstruct spectra for any desired time - interval , as well as high time - resolution lightcurves .",
    "the observations were timed such that the target was within the continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) .",
    "consequently we were able to observe over about 9hrs with only small gaps for wavelength calibrations and mode changes .",
    "this covered two complete binary orbits .    to obtain a lightcurve , we extracted source counts from a 50pixel wide window centered on the target and background from two similar regions on either side .",
    "geo - coronal hi ly@xmath2 and oi 1304  lines were masked out of both source and background regions , as were the extreme ends of the detector .",
    "it was necessary to use this background subtraction procedure as the background was found to be larger than the nominal global 7cnts@xmath3 dark current and time dependent .",
    "this intermittent ` glow ' is not easily modeled @xcite so is best removed empirically .",
    "we did this by subtracting a polynomial fit to the background lightcurve .",
    "source counts out of burst were @xmath4s@xmath3 and the estimated background within the source window was @xmath5s@xmath3 ; for comparison the nominal dark current should only be @xmath6s@xmath3 within this window .",
    "we used 1s time - resolution to approximately match the gemini - s optical photometry .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , _",
    "hst_/stis absolute timing accuracy is uncertain at a level of up to a few seconds , so we did not attempt precise barycenter corrections and allowed the zero point of the _ hst _  timing to be a free parameter in subsequent analysis .",
    "flux calibration of the lightcurves was derived from the average spectra , and takes advantage of the reddening measurement ( @xmath7 ) possible with complementary near - uv data ( see paper iii ) . for each g140l spectrum",
    "we compared the observed counts as a function of wavelength with the dereddened fluxes @xcite to determine the effective sensitivity , hence defining our far - uv bandpass .",
    "we then used this sensitivity function to derive weighted average wavelengths and fluxes .",
    "these averages were consistent to @xmath8  in wavelength , and @xmath8%  in flux between the six g140l spectra .",
    "the effective wavelength derived ( for our spectral shape ) was 1388 .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration of observed fluxes is 4%  ( from the documented flux calibration of low - resolution stis / mama modes ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the dominant term is due to the uncertainty in dereddening  this introduces a @xmath9percent uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the far - uv lightcurves , and @xmath10percent in the relative calibration of the uv and optical fluxes ( since these errors are correlated ) .",
    "if the extinction curve differs from the assumed @xcite form then the error could be larger .      on the nights of february 1718 and 1819 , we used the acquisition camera ( acqcam ) on gemini - south to obtain fast @xmath0 band optical photometry ( see table  [ opticaltable ] for details ) .",
    "conditions were photometric , with realized image quality on target mostly @xmath11arcsec , although this degraded to @xmath12arcsec in the latter part of the second night .",
    "for practical data acquisition it was necessary to break each night into series of ( usually ) 4000images at a time .",
    "the series obtained , totaling 37000 images , are listed in table  [ opticaltable ] .",
    "one of the great strengths of this instrument for fast photometry is the fast readout .",
    "we used the camera windowed and binned ( @xmath13 giving @xmath14 0.24arcsec binned pixels ) .",
    "other data acquisition modifications were made to further minimize the dead - time between images .",
    "this dead - time was not absolutely constant , but was usually 0.3050.310s , with occasional ( less than one per few hundred ) glitches to as high as 0.44s .",
    "the precise time - stamps were taken from when the image completed writing to disk , so the start time of the subsequent image ( relative to the first in a series ) was known .",
    "the start time of the first image is taken from a gps based clock .",
    "basic reductions including bias removal , subtraction of the significant dark current , and flat - fielding were done using the agreduce script within iraf .",
    "the windowed field includes one star much brighter than uy  vol , which provided a high fidelity reference star and two other comparisons ( one brighter , one fainter ) which were used to verify the accuracy of the results .",
    "we experimented with both small aperture photometry using iraf and optimal photometry as implemented in the starlink photom package ( see @xcite for the algorithm this is based on ) .",
    "we found negligible difference between the two methods provided the aperture ( for unweighted photometry ) was optimized .",
    "we opted to use the results from the optimal algorithm as this explicitly adjusts the weighting per image and so should be more robust against changes in seeing .",
    "we used the comparison stars to verify that the standard deviations of the resulting lightcurves are dominated by the formal errors in the photometry .",
    "the formal errors for uy  vol  were typically @xmath15percent per 0.8sec exposure .",
    "absolute calibration was done with respect to two stars from sa104 ( landolt 1992 ) on the first night .",
    "we derive magnitudes of @xmath16 for the reference star and 17.418.0 for uy",
    "vol  ( excluding bursts ) .",
    "the magnitude range derived for uy  vol  is within the range observed by earlier studies ( e.g.  17.118.1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital lightcurves will be considered in a subsequent paper .    finally , we corrected the observed magnitudes for interstellar extinction ( assuming @xmath17 based on the 2175  feature in our _ hst _  data ) and converted to fluxes with the conversion constant of @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations were obtained with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) in two blocks timed to coincide with optical spectroscopy ( paper ii ) , and the optical and uv observations described above .",
    "a log is presented in table  [ opticaltable ] .",
    "x - ray lightcurves of the bursts were recovered from a 64channel event mode of the proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "see @xcite for discussion of the current status of the pca .",
    "since the source counts are high during a burst , and the timescale is short , we used all pcus which were switched on , including pcu0 .",
    "we initially processed lightcurves from each pcu separately , however , to check that no background flares were present in pcu0 , before combining them .",
    "background lightcurves ( with 16s time - resolution ) were constructed from the l7/240 faint source combined models dated 2002 feb 1 .",
    "this should allow the most reliable background subtraction from the pre - and post - burst lightcurves .",
    "since the l7 rate is modified for bright sources , however , this model lightcurve is contaminated during the burst .",
    "we therefore interpolated between the pre- and post - burst modeled background rates to define the burst background and subtracted this .",
    "we note that in practice the background subtraction has little impact on the results described here as we perform an additional empirical subtraction of the persistent ( pre- and post - burst ) flux .",
    "hence more refined background models would not significantly affect our results .",
    "lightcurves were initially extracted for 25kev , 512kev and 1260kev bandpasses .",
    "the burst profiles varied significantly with energy , so it is important to be careful in choosing an appropriate lightcurve for a deconvolution .",
    "we therefore also constructed a 220kev integrated flux lightcurve . to do this , we estimated approximate per - channel conversions from count rates to fluxes using xspec and appropriate response matrices .",
    "we used a black body fit to the average burst spectrum to define these conversions to ensure that the relative weighting within each channel was approximately correct .",
    "we then applied these conversions to each channel and summed the fluxes .",
    "this will be somewhat noisier than a straight sum of count rates , but represents our best estimate of the evolution of the flux irradiating the disk and the companion star .",
    "based on the black body fits to the spectra , the 220kev bandpass accounts for most of the burst flux ( @xmath18% ) , so additional bolometric corrections are ignored .",
    "any attempt to quantitatively model observations of uy  vol  requires system parameters .",
    "uy  vol  does not yet benefit from dynamical estimates , so we must use more indirect constraints .",
    "fortunately it is eclipsing , and precisely defined x - ray eclipses provide exquisitely detailed measurements of the orbital period and duration of the neutron star eclipse @xcite . through these eclipses , we know that the inclination must be high , and the relationship between mass ratio and inclination is well defined . assuming recent eclipse durations of @xmath19s , we obtain the relationship shown in fig .",
    "[ qvsincfig ] . we can attempt to further constrain the available parameter space in other ways .",
    "the fact that we see the sharp neutron star eclipse at all indicates that uy  volis not an accretion disk corona ( adc ) source .",
    "this means the inclination can not be too high as our line - of - sight must pass over the disk rim .",
    "the disk rim height is not known directly , but must be greater than that expected from hydrostatic support alone .",
    "this is a very weak constraint , however ; for example , for a disk half - thickness of 0.03 , we only require @xmath20 .",
    "this constraint is shown in fig .",
    "[ qvsincfig ] .",
    "other constraints are more model - dependent .",
    "we can make plausible estimates of the range of mass ratios likely , although values outside of this range are still possible .",
    "the companion star to uy  vol  is probably above the hydrogen burning limit and non - degenerate .",
    "this implies @xmath21m@xmath22 @xcite . assuming a 1.35m@xmath22 neutron star @xcite then yields a minimum mass ratio of 0.05 .",
    "this limit is soft , as a more massive neutron star is certainly possible if it has accreted significant mass from the companion ( as seems likely in 2s  0921630 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the high mass - ratio end",
    ", we can assume that the companion star is underdense compared to a main - sequence star that would fill the roche lobe . again assuming a 1.35m@xmath22 neutron star this yields the upper limit on the mass ratio shown .",
    "this could be increased a little for a somewhat lower mass neutron star , and further if the companion is actually overdense .",
    "this is possible if the companion had undergone nuclear evolution , before losing most of its envelope in mass transfer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the neutron star might also be expected to be more massive .",
    "consequently , there is probably not much scope for a mass ratio higher than 0.4 in this system .",
    "it should be noted that the constraints considered so far are effectively the same as obtained by @xcite , namely @xmath23 .",
    "as discussed above , the limits are rather soft , and a slightly larger range is possible with a companion star and/or neutron star with extreme properties .    to obtain other parameters of interest , we synthesize a population of possible binaries . we assume the known orbital period , and the relationship between mass ratio and inclination given in fig .",
    "[ qvsincfig ] .",
    "we consider neutron star masses with an asymmetric gaussian distribution @xmath24m@xmath22 , i.e. , following @xcite , but allowing for a higher mass tail due to mass transfer .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution of companion star masses between 0.07m@xmath22 , and the mass at which main - sequence density is reached .    we derive a relatively narrow range of binary separations , @xmath25",
    "cm ( at 90%  confidence ) , since the binary period is known and there is not a large uncertainty in the total system mass .",
    "disk parameters are more uncertain ; the tidal truncation radius is @xmath26 cm and the projected area of a flat disk would be @xmath27@xmath28",
    ". the projected area of the companion star , with a spherical approximation , would be @xmath29@xmath28 .",
    "while in general , the companion is expected to subtend a larger projected area than the disk , only a phase - dependent fraction of this will be x - ray heated , so this should be considered an upper limit on the area of the luminous regions of the companion , which could be significantly less than that of the disk .",
    "we can estimate light travel times in the same way .",
    "the maximum lag from the pole of the companion star would be @xmath30s at phase 0.5 , although most of the heated inner face would of course be a little shorter than this .",
    "lags from the disk would be expected to span a range from zero to @xmath31s assuming it extends to the tidal truncation radius .",
    "we define several test cases consistent with fig .",
    "[ qvsincfig ] : model 1 has @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "model 2 has @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and model 3 has @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "[ binsimfig ] shows a schematic view corresponding to model 2 at phases when bursts were observed .",
    "an important factor in considering irradiation of the companion star is the opening angle of the disk , @xmath38 . for our purposes",
    ", this defines the height of x - ray absorbing material , which may be above the optical photosphere , and may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium ( for example material thrown up from the stream impact point or local flares ) .",
    "values derived from other objects have generally been rather high . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath39 and cite other authors who obtained a range of 614@xmath40 . in our case ,",
    "the highest values are ruled out in some models , as uy  vol  is not an adc source  we see neutron star eclipses and prominent bursts , hence we do observe the neutron star directly .",
    "thus the opening angle must be less than @xmath41 , i.e.  less than @xmath42 for model 1 and less than @xmath43 for model 2 .",
    "this is not a constraint for model 3 .",
    "note that the presence of eclipses also indicates that at least some of the companion star must be exposed to direct radiation from the neutron star ; it can not be fully shielded by the disk .",
    "a final important parameter is the distance to uy  vol .",
    "the best indicator of this is in neutron star lmxbs is the peak flux observed during radius expansion x - ray bursts as this is believed to be an approximate standard candle @xcite .",
    "three radius expansion bursts were reported by @xcite and @xcite used these , together with the calibration of @xcite , to derive a distance range to uy  vol  of 6.89.1kpc , with the low end of the range corresponding to burning of material of normal composition and the upper end to hydrogen poor material .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a brighter radius expansion burst seen by _ rxte _  to obtain distances of @xmath44kpc or @xmath45kpc for hydrogen rich and poor bursts respectively .",
    "the latter authors argue that the variation in brightness likely reflects variable obscuration and hence that their brighter burst gives a more reliable distance measurement .",
    "we will thus use the midpoint of the latter estimates for this work , 6.8kpc . allowing for the composition ambiguity , all luminosities and estimated areas quoted in this work",
    "will then be uncertain by @xmath46% due to the uncertain distance .",
    "our _ rxte _  coverage detected a total of 6 bursts , including two weak ones , listed in table  [ bursttable ] .",
    "one of these , mb3b , was observed in a pair where the second is weaker than the first , and the other , xb1 , could also have been preceded by an unobserved normal burst as it occurs at the beginning of a time - series .",
    "four of these bursts , including the pair , were observed by gemini - s and one of these also by _ hst _ , giving x - ray , uv , and optical coverage of the same burst .",
    "the data quality in the uv , and especially the optical , is superb , making these the best observed optical bursts in any source .",
    "the bursts with multiwavelength coverage are shown in fig .",

    "2003 feb 19 , 06:09:08 & 0.51 +    one of the simultaneously observed bursts , mb3a , shows dips in the otherwise smooth decay .",
    "this burst occurred at orbital phase 0.478 , so does not lie within the classical dipping phase - range but our x - ray data do appear to show additional dipping near phase 0.5 ( paper iii ) , so it might be due to transient absorption by intervening material . in support of this , the dip does appear most pronounced in the 25kev energy band , and is absent in the optical data .",
    "both these characteristics suggest that the dips are due to absorption of the direct x - rays along our line - of - sight , rather than variations in the intrinsic burst luminosity .",
    "cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) provide a relatively simple technique for examining lags between lightcurves , and one which is widely used allowing comparison with other datasets .",
    "we therefore begin with this approach , before developing other techniques customized to the reprocessed burst problem .",
    "the datasets we have are almost exactly evenly sampled , but the gemini - s photometry has a somewhat longer sampling interval than the _ rxte _  or _ hst _  data .",
    "interpolation cross - correlation functions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are thus ideally suited to these data .",
    "we show all of the ccfs in fig .",

    "the lags derived are consistent , but the shapes of the ccf are not .",
    "the ccf lags do suggest a positive correlation between orbital phase and mean lag , but the evidence is not compelling ( and would vanish if mb1 were removed from the sample ) .",
    "nonetheless , this is as expected if there is a significant contribution to the reprocessed signal from the surface of the companion star , as the lag from this will be minimum at phase 0.0 and maximum at phase 0.5 .",
    "this behavior is also consistent with the finding of @xcite that the _ rise time _ of optical bursts ( without simultaneous x - ray coverage ) was correlated with the orbital phase in the same sense .",

    "the quality of the ccfs are superb and the major concern relates to the meaningfulness of the lag derived .",
    "fundamental to the ccf approach is the assumption that the optical / uv is simply a lagged version of the x - rays , but this is clearly not the case in the burst lightcurves , and is not expected theoretically .",
    "several factors may be important .",
    "one is light travel times .",
    "these will not only produce a mean lag , but will tend to smear out the signal , as different lags are produced by different reprocessing sites @xcite .",
    "a second factor having a similar effect is that there may be a finite diffusion time associated with reprocessing ; if x - rays deposit energy at a significant optical depth it can not be re - radiated instantly , but there will be further lagging and smearing as the energy diffuses outward . finally , the tails of the bursts are clearly different , indicating non - linear relationships between the lightcurves .",
    "this occurs because the bursts have a large amplitude and substantially change the temperature of both the neutron star and the reprocessing site .",
    "as a site cools , the peak of the emitted spectrum moves to lower energies . in the case of the reprocessed light ,",
    "it moves out of the far - uv , and into the optical , having the effect of accelerating the far - uv decay rate ( relative to the bolometric decay ) and suppressing the optical decay .",
    "none of these factors are accounted for in cross - correlations , so a more sophisticated model is needed .",
    "for example , lags can be over or under - estimated if the timing characteristics of the two lightcurves differ @xcite , reflecting the more general problem that in this case there is not a uniquely defined lag .",
    "there is a range , from which a ccf favors an average value .",
    "we next attempt to deconvolve the lightcurves to obtain the transfer function between x - ray and optical wavelengths independent of the width of the burst . this will be more readily interpreted than the ccf which is much broader than the transfer function .",
    "we initially use the maximum entropy method ( mem ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which does not require an assumed model for the transfer function , beyond an assumed default used in calculating entropy . in principle , the mem method can then resolve distinct sub - structures , if they are present , for example the disk and companion star .    for each burst",
    "we use our x - ray flux lightcurves as the driver signal and attempt to fit the optical or uv echo over the range @xmath47 to @xmath48s relative to the burst rise .",
    "the transfer function was calculated for lags of @xmath47s to @xmath49s .",
    "we use a narrow gaussian default to minimize enforced smoothing of the derived transfer functions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ memfig ] .",
    "negligible response was seen before @xmath50s , and slow declines after @xmath51s ; these regions are not shown .",
    "as expected , the derived transfer functions are much narrower than the ccfs .",
    "all bursts suggest a single - peaked response peaking at a lag of a few seconds , very close to the locations of the maxima of the corresponding ccfs .",
    "besides the main peak , all the transfer functions have a tail extending to larger lags .",
    "this may be a real effect , as models of reprocessing of bursts by stellar atmospheres do predict a small amount of the energy emerges with large delays ( @xcite ; see section  [ diffusionsection ] for more discussion ) .",
    "we can not say with confidence that this effect is real , however , as there is another explanation for it . as noted earlier ,",
    "the bandpass - limited response is non - linear , and in particular the optical burst decay is much slower than that in x - rays because the reprocessed spectrum shifts to longer wavelengths ( into the optical band ) as it cools .",
    "a method which assumes a linear response will require an extended tail to reproduce this . in support of this interpretation ,",
    "the effect is much weaker in the transfer function derived from uv data as expected .",
    "this effect complicates the interpretation of the shape of the transfer functions using this method . in addition , while it is tempting to ascribe the narrower transfer function from mb1 to a phase - dependent effect , the response to mb3a is also narrower , and in general one has to be cautious in interpreting widths derived from mem echo maps as a broader , smoother peak inherently has higher entropy .",
    "we therefore seek a less biased approach .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a method for constraining the transfer function by parameterizing it as a gaussian function .",
    "our mem reconstructions indicate that the data do not require multiple resolved components in the transfer function .",
    "this does not mean that the true transfer function does not include multiple components ; only that they are not well constrained by the data .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the relatively long burst timescale , which limits our sensitivity to fine temporal structure in the response .",
    "consequently the single gaussian transfer function is an adequate approximation to this problem and it lends itself well to adapting to the rather different assumptions needed for burst mapping .    these arise because of the large amplitude of the variations .",
    "we have already discussed one problem this causes ; the x - ray lightcurves are strongly energy dependent , so determining the driving lightcurve is non - trivial .",
    "this arises because the x - ray flux arises from heating and cooling of the neutron star surface ; as the surface cools , the spectrum softens and moves out of the higher energy bands .",
    "we have addressed this by calculating a 220kev integrated flux lightcurve , using the spectral information to ensure the correct internal relative weighting .",
    "similar difficulties exist with the optical and uv data .",
    "the optical burst is more prolonged than the uv one , for the same reason as the bursts are more prolonged at low energies ; the reprocessed spectrum is moving out of the uv band into the optical as the reprocessing regions cool .",
    "the net effect of this is that the optical and uv fluxes do not respond linearly to the x - ray flux , and the amplitude of the variations is too large for them to be treated as a small , linearized perturbation .",
    "this is actually a blessing in disguise however , as we can then use the relative changes between the optical and uv fluxes to constrain the temperature evolution , and hence also the emitting area of the reprocessing region . without this information",
    ", there would be a degeneracy between temperature and area , and indeed this is a problem when we try to fit optical or uv data independently .",
    "for example , @xcite attempted a similar analysis of 4u1636536 using @xmath52 photometry and were able to estimate that the bursts involved a rise in temperature of the reprocessor from @xmath53k to @xmath54k .",
    "we formulate the problem as follows .",
    "we assume that an input x - ray lightcurve ( the 220kev integrated flux ) is a suitable proxy for the bolometric illuminating luminosity , @xmath55 .",
    "reprocessing is assumed to occur within a fixed area @xmath56 ( assumed to be of negligible geometric depth ) with uniform temperature @xmath57 .",
    "the spatial position and extent of this region introduces a mean lag , @xmath58 , and a blur @xmath59 in the reprocessed bolometric luminosity relative to the illuminating luminosity . the temperature is then allowed to vary ( with fixed reprocessing area ) such that @xmath60 , where the reprocessed luminosity is assumed to be related to the x - ray luminosity via the transfer function , @xmath61 : @xmath62 .",
    "given the temperature evolution and area we can then predict the bandpass - limited uv and optical flux evolution .",
    "this requires a model for the reprocessed spectrum , for which we assume a black body in the absence of a better choice .",
    "the problem can be parameterized in terms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , defining the transfer function ( which is arbitrarily normalized ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 which are the minimum temperature and the peak irradiation temperature , defined such that @xmath65 , and @xmath56 , the projected cross - sectional area of the reprocessing region .",
    "ideally this gives enough parameters to fit the uv and optical lightcurves simultaneously . in practice , some additional nuisance parameters are needed .",
    "since the _ hst _  absolute timing is uncertain , we fit the optical and uv lags independently ; the optical should be reliable , but the uv one is not , comprising both a true lag and a clock uncertainty . we also allow the optical and uv bursts to have different reprocessing areas .",
    "this is initially assumed to reflect uncertainties in the calibration of the optical photometry and in dereddening of the optical : uv flux ratio , rather than physical differences .",
    "in the ideal case , both lags and both areas would be equal .",
    "we begin with the burst which has both uv and optical coverage as this should be best constrained .",
    "it also allows us to test the reliability of the optical fit by comparing it with the joint optical - uv fit .",
    "we search for the best fitting models ( in the @xmath66 sense ) using a downhill simplex method @xcite . to guard against converging on a local minimum",
    "each fit used three passes , each starting at the previous best fit , and we also varied the initial starting simplex to approach the minimum from different directions in parameter space .",
    "we find that the method can reproduce both the optical and uv lightcurves very well . the best fitting joint model ( mb2 - 1 ) is shown in fig .  [ mbfirstfig ] and table  [ gaussfittable ] , with approximately the same parameters found for a variety of starting simplexes",
    "there was a small jitter dependent on the starting point , but this was much less than the uncertainties that we estimate , so all fits agreed to within errors .",
    "the best fitting reduced @xmath66 is 1.85 , but this is pessimistic .",
    "the reason is that we have used the x - ray lightcurve to construct the model , and its errors have not been accounted for . to compensate for this in deriving estimates of errors on the fit parameters , we use the common technique of rescaling the errors so that the best fit model has @xmath67 .",

    "the large discrepancy in the area derived from the optical and uv is more problematic , however , indicating that the optical / uv flux ratio is very different from that implied by the temperatures ; the optical is a factor of @xmath121 brighter than expected .",
    "this is much larger than can be accommodated from errors in the dereddening ( 16% ) , uv flux calibration ( 4% ) or optical calibration ( probably less than 10% ) .",
    "the difference is clearly significant ; a similar fit with the areas forced to be equal ( mb2 - 2 ) results in a visibly poor fit to the uv lightcurve .",
    "since the derived magnitudes are already at the low end of the range observed by previous studies it is more likely that the optical flux has been underestimated than that it has been overestimated by a magnitude as required .",
    "if the extinction curve is far from the galactic average , then a larger reddening correction to the uv is possible , and this could rectify the problem .    alternatively , there may be a deficiency in the model .",
    "the most likely interpretation is that the reprocessing region is not isothermal ; indeed this is not expected to be the case .",
    "the disk is expected to span wide range of temperatures from rim to center , and the companion star will provide an additional reprocessing site . a multi - temperature spectrum will be broader than a single temperature one , and if the peak is in the uv ( as implied by the derived temperatures ) , then this will flatten the optical tail and increase the optical fluxes .",
    "a simple test of whether this explanation can help resolve the discrepancy is to use simple irradiated disk spectra as discussed by @xcite . instead of using black bodies of temperature @xmath122 , we use irradiated disk spectra with irradiation temperature at the edge @xmath122 , and viscous temperature set to zero . in practice the latter constraint only means that the temperature is dominated by irradiative heating ; increasing the viscous temperature reduced the quality of the fit .",
    "models mb2 - 3 and mb2 - 4 show parameters derived using this alternate spectral model for floating and fixed areas respectively .",
    "clearly this model does represent an improvement , as the discrepancy between optical and uv areas has been reduced when they are allowed to float , and the quality of fit is substantially better if they are fixed to be the same .",
    "this does not appear to be the whole story , however , as a discrepancy remains .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the cooler response from the companion star ( which is inferred to contribute ; see section  [ echotomsection ] ) .",
    "we tried adding another black body component , but found that beyond this point fits were poorly constrained and multiple solutions were possible , all yielding good fits with no discrepancy in optical and uv areas .",
    "we feel that a better way to approach this problem is to use a model of the binary following the approach of @xcite , in which the binary geometry reduces the independence of the parameters that we currently have using arbitrary components .",
    "such a model would , however , benefit from information gleaned from other aspects of our dataset , for example the orbital lightcurves , so we defer this treatment to paper iii .    as a precursor to examining mb1 and mb3 , for which only optical data are available",
    ", we also tested fitting optical and uv lightcurves separately .",
    "we initially tried fitting with all the parameters left free , but found that the problem was then very poorly constrained ; a single bandpass did not allow us to uniquely determine both minimum and maximum temperatures .",
    "the formal minimum for an optical - only fit occurs for very low @xmath123k .",
    "while this may be of order the stellar temperature , the regions of the star exposed to bursts are also exposed to persistent radiation , and should not be this cool .",
    "furthermore , this solution is strongly inconsistent with the uv lightcurve , and is only a shallow minimum ; @xmath66 is virtually constant for all @xmath124k .",
    "we thus chose to instead fix @xmath63 to the value determined by the joint fit , 18,500k .",
    "the parameters derived in this case ( mb2 - 5 and mb2 - 6 ) were not significantly different from those based on the joint fit . the lags can not be reliably compared , due to the uncertainty in _ hst _  timing , but there is no significant difference between the widths derived .",
    "one important statement can be made from these analyses . independently of whether we fit optical and uv data jointly or separately , and regardless of the spectral model assumed , we derive essentially the same lags and widths , i.e.  the transfer function derived is robust and not sensitive to these assumptions .",
    "this means we can usefully compare transfer functions from different bursts that do not have uv coverage , and without knowing the correct spectral model to use .",
    "we now consider the double burst , mb3 .",
    "this is a more complex case than mb1 but occurred only about four hours ( one binary orbit ) after mb2 on the same night , so there are less likely to have been large changes in the accretion flow geometry than for the first burst which occurred about 20hours ( 5 binary orbits ) earlier .",
    "since mb3a and mb3b are so close together , we perform a fit to both simultaneously , as this will provide a visual check of the consistency between the two bursts .",
    "the major difficulty with these bursts is that they exhibit dips , most prominently around 35s and 360s .",
    "these dips are clearly not present in the optical data , and appear more prominent at low energies ( fig .",
    "[ multiburstfig ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the dips are due to absorption of the x - rays , and should be excluded from any attempt to model the optical data .",
    "we do this by masking out regions of the optical lightcurve that would be affected .",
    "the masked regions are indicated in fig .",
    "[ mbthreefig ] .    as for mb2 ,",
    "@xmath63 is not meaningfully constrained by the data in the absence of uv coverage . for @xmath125k , @xmath66 is virtually constant , and while cooler solutions are formally favored , we choose to ignore them for the reasons described above .",
    "a fit with @xmath126k is not visibly worse than one with very low @xmath63 , so we choose to use this value for lack of better information .",

    "a slightly larger width is derived from mb3 , but the difference may not be significant .",
    "it would be expected if the response arises from a combination of disk and companion star , however , as mb3 occurred around phase 0.5 when the lag from the companion star is maximized .",
    "the difference in temperatures and areas is larger , but may be related to each other .",
    "we have artificially fixed @xmath63 , which will have the effect of also constraining @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath63 had actually increased between bursts , then the corresponding @xmath64 would also have been higher , and a lower area would have been required to fit the mb3 fluxes .",
    "for example , a fit with @xmath63 fixed to 21,000k greatly reduces the discrepancy between @xmath64 and @xmath70 between mb2 and mb3 . without uv data ,",
    "however , we can not say which of these ( or other ) combinations are correct , so have chosen to assume that @xmath63 does not change .",
    "we have left mb1 until last as this is the least constrained case .",
    "we do not have uv data allowing independent fits of @xmath63 and @xmath127 , but neither are we well justified in assuming similarity to mb2 or mb3 . mb1 occurred on the preceding night , and also at phase 0.2 when our visibility of the system was significantly different .",
    "we might then expect any of the parameters to be different .",
    "nonetheless , we will begin from the same starting point as for mb3 , i.e.  assuming that @xmath128k , as for mb2 , and performing an unconstrained fit on the other parameters .",
    "this burst is more problematic than the preceding ones , as there are actually two plausible solutions differing mainly in the width of the transfer function .",

    "[ widthchifig ] the dependence of normalized @xmath66 on the gaussian width , @xmath59 for all three bursts . for mb2 and mb3",
    "there was a single , well - defined minimum , and the location is approximately the same for these two bursts .",
    "this width is clearly not consistent with the data from mb1 , and a narrower transfer function is required .",
    "formally the best fit occurs for a very narrow transfer function : mb1 - 1 as listed in table  [ gaussfittable ] .",
    "@xmath66 is a rather complex function of @xmath59 is this region , and the best fit represents a very narrow minimum ( hence the unrealistically small uncertainties for @xmath59 in model mb1 - 1 ) .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the behavior at small @xmath59 may reflect random correlations in the noise between x - ray and optical lightcurves .",
    "a secondary minimum is present corresponding to a broader transfer function , model mb1 - 2 .",
    "this minimum more closely resembles those seen for mb2 and mb3 , and we suspect that this could be the true solution . in support of this",
    ", we show both models fitted to the data in fig .",
    "[ mbonefig ] .",
    "model mb1 - 1 predicts a steeper optical rise than observed , whereas mb1 - 2 gives approximately the correct rise time .",
    "it is not obvious in what respect mb1 - 1 is preferred , also indicating that it could owe more to fitting the noise than to fitting the real structure .",
    "we will therefore adopt mb1 - 2 as the preferred fit to this burst .",
    "the parameters obtained do seem plausible .",
    "we derive a shorter lag and narrower lag distribution ( independently of whether we adopt mb1 - 1 or mb1 - 2 ) .",
    "both are to be expected at phase 0.2 , as the companion star will make less contribution , and will do so at a shorter lag",
    ". the temperature and area derived are comparable , although a smaller reprocessing area is found , again as expected at this phase . based on these parameters there is no need to invoke significant differences in the geometry or temperature of the reprocessing regions between the two nights .",
    "nonetheless we did attempt fits with a range of @xmath63 values . as for other bursts we find that formally the best fits are for unphysically low base temperatures ( @xmath129k , but that a large range of values larger than this also give acceptable fits . there is no reason to prefer a different @xmath63 value to mb2 or mb3 .",
    "as our mb2 uv data were obtained in a spectroscopic mode , as well as obtaining the lightcurve of the reprocessed burst , we have a unique opportunity to examine its spectrum .",
    "[ burstspecfig ] shows the spectrum of the extra light during the first 100s of the burst .",
    "this was constructed by extracting a series of 100s sub - spectra using the stsdas task inttag and processing them in the same way as regular spectra .",
    "the non - burst spectrum was defined from 300s intervals before and after the burst .",
    "more details of the spectral reduction will be provided in paper ii .",
    "the burst spectrum appears to be continuum dominated with only a weak contribution from the lines .",
    "ciii 1175  is particularly strongly enhanced , and to a lesser extent nv 1240 , but neither dominate the flux .",
    "the burst is not pronounced at all in civ 1550  or heii 1640 .",
    "the continuum shape is consistent with the burst models described earlier , being well fitted by the difference between a black body with temperature @xmath130k and one at @xmath131k .",
    "the upper temperature corresponds to the expected flux - weighted average temperature during the 100s interval contributing to the burst as calculated from model 1 for mb2 .",
    "this shows that the model does reproduce the wavelength dependence as well as the temporal evolution .",
    "it also indirectly supports our low reddening value ( @xmath7 ) derived from the 2175  interstellar feature ( paper iii ) .",
    "if this reddening had been underestimated due to an anomalously weak 2175  feature then in general we would not expect the temperature implied by the shape of the spectrum to be consistent with that earlier obtained only from time - dependence of the reprocessed light , and the far - uv spectrum would be redder .",
    "one of the primary goals of echo mapping is echo - tomography : phase - dependent echo maps in which different components , such as the disk and companion star , can be disentangled based on different amplitudes and phasings of phase dependence . in principle",
    "this technique could even be used to obtain a direct measure of the binary separation and orbital inclination independent of other constraints .",
    "real datasets have , however , fallen far short of these aspirations , and we certainly would not claim that the results presented here fulfill the hopes of echo - mapping . nonetheless , we do see changes in the response , and it is worthwhile to investigate if they are consistent with expected phase - dependent changes , and can constrain the parameters of uy  vol .",
    "one of the major limitations , of course , is that mb1 was obtained on a different night to mb2 and mb3 .",
    "since mb1 provides the main sensitivity to phase - dependent changes , we must apply the caveat that the differences observed could reflect secular changes in the actual reprocessing geometry rather than just differences in our viewing angle . the persistent ( pre - burst ) x - ray flux is essentially the same for mb1 and mb2 .",
    "it is lower for mb3 , but there is some evidence for dipping at this time .",
    "this implies no substantial difference in the accretion rate between the mb1 and mb2 epochs .",
    "optical lightcurves will be compared in paper iii and should be very sensitive to changes in the reprocessing geometry between epochs .",
    "the optical lightcurve at the time of mb1 is somewhat different , but the differences are not dramatic and may primarily reflect different realizations of the strong flickering which is present in the optical data .",
    "the amplitude of the differences between mb1 and mb2 epochs ( @xmath132% ) is comparable to that between mb2 and mb3 epochs , and also to the amplitude of individual flickering events .",
    "there is thus no compelling evidence for a change in the state of the system , but this possibility can not be securely discounted .    assuming it is reasonable to compare the responses from the three bursts ,",
    "the major difference is that mb2 and mb3 both have responses that are lagged and smeared by more .",
    "this is as expected from their phases .",
    "[ echotomfig ] shows predicted responses as a function of orbital phase calculated using the methods described by @xcite for model 2 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "given the limitations inherent in approximating the true response with a gaussian , the range of lags observed is in reasonable agreement with predictions . in particular , we do expect that mb2 ( phase 0.38 ) will have a similar lag distribution to mb3 ( phase @xmath133 ) , whereas we expect a quicker and less smeared response from mb1 , as observed .",
    "the amplitude of the difference between responses is in approximate agreement with expectations .",
    "when plotted in this way , it is apparent that all bursts appear to show the onset of a strong response at approximately the same time , but that mb2 and mb3 extend for longer beyond that .",
    "while the general picture is in agreement with predictions , it is clear that the data are not precise enough to constrain the system parameters further .",
    "nonetheless , the very fact that the response appears to change with phase , and with such a large amplitude , does indicate significant response from the companion , and the large smearing of the response around phase 0.5 indicates that the disk must also contribute .",
    "we can also consider these results in the context of other observations of this and other sources .",
    "the comparison of most interest is with @xcite .",
    "these authors found that optical bursts ( with no simultaneous x - ray coverage ) exhibited longer rise times when the companion star would be on the far side of the disk .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the smearing increases close to phase 0.5 ( as we also find ) , provided that the intrinsic rise time of the x - ray bursts is the same .",
    "the large dispersion in the response that we see close to phase 0.5 is also not unprecedented .",
    "similar dispersions were found by @xcite for 4u1636536 , and by @xcite for gs182624 . in all of these cases",
    "they likely indicate contribution from both disk and companion , as a response from the companion alone will vary in lag , but should always have a relatively narrow response .",
    "there are two likely sources of smearing of the reprocessed signal .",
    "the delays most commonly discussed ( and considered so far ) are those from light - travel times across the binary ; global delays .",
    "a finite reprocessing time could also introduce a local delay .",
    "x - rays above about 1kev will experience a low - enough photo - electric absorption opacity to deposit energy at a significant optical depth in an atmosphere .",
    "reprocessed energy will then have to diffuse outward , and so there will be an additional diffusion time delay .",
    "this topic was considered initially by @xcite in analyzing bursts from 4u  1636536 .",
    "they estimated that the diffusion time for a typical photon would be @xmath134s , largely negligible compared to the expected light travel time delays .",
    "@xcite examined the problem more rigorously , calculating time - dependent responses of a hot stellar atmosphere to an x - ray burst , including the effect of the burst on the atmospheric temperature structure and opacities .",
    "their results were in agreement with those of @xcite , and they found that 50%  of the reprocessed light is expected within just 0.2s , but that there was also a very extended tail to the response up to 10s .",
    "finally , @xcite also considered this issue , but neglected photo - absorption , which will be critical for the soft x - rays produced in a burst .",
    "based on these calculations , we would not expect our method to be significantly affected by reprocessing times , as a gaussian response approximation will be dominated by when most of the light emerges , and this occurs within a fraction of a second .",
    "indeed , our observations are broadly consistent with expectations from light travel time delays and , allowing for the limitations of the gaussian approximation , do not obviously require additional local delays .    this conclusion may be different from that obtained for correlated flickering in the low - mass x - ray binaries sco x-1 and lmc x-2 , for which @xcite argue that lags may be too long for light travel times alone . more and better data are needed to confirm this discrepancy , but if confirmed the key difference may be in the nature and spectrum of the x - ray irradiation . @xcite also considered harder irradiation than that provided by an x - ray burst , and found that it could increase the diffusion timescale significantly ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus while reprocessing times are of marginal significance in considering burst reprocessing , they may be of more importance for other applications where further investigation is needed .",
    "the corollary of this is that the relatively soft irradiation of bursts may provide the least biased way to isolate light travel time delays and hence the ideal signal for echo - tomography .",
    "it is interesting to compare the deduced reprocessing temperatures with those expected based on the x - ray luminosity , as this provides a test of the reprocessing efficiency .",
    "we will consider mb2 , for which the temperatures are best constrained .",
    "for this burst , the persistent luminosity ( at 6.8kpc ) was @xmath135ergs@xmath3 and the peak burst luminosity was @xmath136ergs@xmath3 .",
    "irradiation of the companion star is sensitive to the mass ratio , as smaller companions will more readily be shielded by the disk .",
    "for example , if we take model 1 ( @xmath32 ) and the typical effective disk opening angle of 12@xmath40 deduced by @xcite then the companion would be completely shielded .",
    "this is clearly not the case , as the companion can directly eclipse the neutron star , but we can not quantify how directly it is illuminated . note that the opening angle need",
    "not be that of the disk rim , but could represent material in the inner disk that can shield the companion . for models 2 and 3 ,",
    "calculations are more straightforward and the differences between the two are less dramatic . for a disk opening angle of 6@xmath40",
    "we expect angles of incidence of greater than 45@xmath40 from normal , increasing to 60@xmath40 for opening angles of 12@xmath40 .",
    "we assume an x - ray albedo for the companion of @xmath137 following @xcite .",
    "we then expect the highest persistent irradiation temperature on the companion of 16,00021,000k depending on mass ratio ( for the range 0.200.34 ) and disk opening angle ( in the range 612@xmath40 ) .",
    "this is the temperature at the point closest to the compact object and most of the irradiated region is at temperatures less than this as the angle of incidence is steeper . at the burst peak",
    "we would expect temperatures of 38,00050,000k .    for the disk we estimate the estimated temperature at the disk rim using the semi - empirical prescription of @xcite and @xcite",
    ". assuming dubus estimate of the irradiation efficiency and a disk radius of @xmath138 cm we expect a persistent irradiation temperature of 9000k and a peak burst temperature of 21,000k",
    ". both of these are the lowest temperatures in the disk , and most of the disk area is hotter than this ( the opposite case to that calculated for the companion star ) . for comparison",
    ", the persistent luminosity of @xmath135ergs@xmath3 corresponds to a mass transfer rate of @xmath139gs@xmath3 . for a steady state lobe - filling disk",
    "the effective temperature due to viscous heating should be just 2500k , indicating that the disk is in a regime that can only remain in a high state with irradiative heating .",
    "our earlier conclusions that the reprocessed bursts likely arise from a combination of emission from the companion star and disk are consistent with these calculations .",
    "our estimate of the peak reprocessing temperature is 35,000k .",
    "the irradiated area of the companion star is expected to have temperatures possibly extending up to 50,000k , while the disk could plausibly have temperatures from 21,000k upward .",
    "the temperature ranges are overlapping , with the greater distance to the companion offset by its more direct illumination , and are consistent with our observations .",
    "we have reported several simultaneous x - ray bursts in the low - mass x - ray binary uy  vol , including the highest quality reprocessed optical coverage , and the only reprocessed uv burst that we are aware of in any source .",
    "these results allow a more thorough test of the paradigm for reprocessing of x - ray bursts , and reprocessing of x - ray emission in general , than previously possible .",
    "several key assertions about reprocessing have been tested .",
    "\\i ) x - rays are absorbed at relatively high optical depths , thermalized , and re - emitted with a quasi - black body spectrum . by obtaining the uv spectrum of the extra light produced during a burst , we have shown that it is indeed dominated by continuum emission , and that the shape of that continuum is consistent with black body emission with temperatures as inferred from the lightcurves of the bursts .",
    "the discrepancy with the optical flux , however , suggests that a single - temperature black body model is not sufficient .",
    "\\ii ) reprocessed emission in the optical and uv is lagged predominantly by light travel times rather than by local photon diffusion .",
    "this appears to be borne out by our observations as light travel times are sufficient to explain the lags and smearing observed .",
    "note that this conclusion ( and the preceding one ) may not be true in general , but may be specific to irradiation with the spectrum of an x - ray burst .",
    "harder or softer irradiation is likely to produce a different response .",
    "\\iii ) x - rays are reprocessed both by the accretion disk and by the companion star .",
    "this is supported by our observations , as we do appear to see a phase - dependence of both the lag and the smearing of the response .",
    "if the response came from the disk alone , we would expect little variation .",
    "if it came from the companion alone , we predict variations in the lag , but not in the smearing .",
    "the temperatures that both the disk and companion are expected to reach during a burst are consistent with our observations .",
    "the failure of a single - zone reprocessor model to explain the relative uv and optical fluxes in the burst also supports a multi - component response .",
    "our observations do not appear to resolve distinct lags from disk and companion , however , possibly a consequence of the long bursts exhibited by uy  vol .",
    "sources which exhibit short duration bursts may be better suited to this analysis .",

    "<S> the discrepancy , corresponding to underpredicting the optical by more than a factor of two , seems too large to explain with deviations from a local black body spectrum and more likely indicates that a range of reprocessing temperatures are required , as would be expected , with cooler regions not contributing to the uv . </S>",
