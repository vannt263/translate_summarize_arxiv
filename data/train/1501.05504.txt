    "since its introduction in 1993,@xcite the density matrix renormalisation group method ( dmrg ) has seen tremendous use in the study of one - dimensional systems.@xcite various improvements such as real - space parallelisation,@xcite the use of abelian and non - abelian symmetries@xcite and multi - grid methods@xcite have been proposed .",
    "most markedly , the introduction@xcite of density matrix perturbation steps allowed the switch from two - site dmrg to single - site dmrg in 2005 , which provided a major speed - up and improved convergence in particular for systems with long - range interactions .",
    "nevertheless , despite some progress,@xcite ( nearly ) two - dimensional systems , such as long cylinders , are still a hard problem for dmrg .",
    "the main reason for this is the different scaling of entanglement due to the area law:@xcite in one dimension , entanglement and hence matrix dimensions in dmrg are essentially size - independent for ground states of gapped systems , whereas in two dimensions , entanglement grows linearly and matrix dimensions roughly exponentially with system width .    as a result ,",
    "the part of the hilbert space considered by dmrg during its ground state search increases dramatically , resulting mainly in three problems : firstly , the dmrg algorithm becomes numerically more challenging as the sizes of matrices involved grow ( we will assume matrix - matrix multiplications to scale as @xmath4 throughout the paper ) .",
    "secondly , the increased search space size makes it more likely to get stuck in local minima .",
    "thirdly , while sequential updates work well in 1-d chains with short - range interactions , nearest - neighbour sites in the 2-d lattice can be separated much farther in the dmrg chain .",
    "therefore , improvements to the core dmrg algorithm are still highly worthwhile .    in this paper",
    ", we will adopt parts of the amen method@xcite developed in the tensor train / numerical linear algebra community to construct a strictly single - site dmrg algorithm that works without accessing the ( full ) reduced density matrix .",
    "compared to the existing _ centermatrix wavefunction formalism _",
    "( cwf),@xcite we achieve a speed - up of @xmath5 during each application of @xmath0 to @xmath1 in the eigensolver during the central optimisation routine , where @xmath3 is the dimension of the physical state space on each site .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section [ sec : notation ] will establish the notation .",
    "section [ sec : cwf ] will recapitulate the density matrix perturbation method and the cwf .",
    "section [ sec : subexp ] will introduce the subspace expansion method and the heuristic expansion term with a simple two - spin example .",
    "the trictly ingle - ite dmrg algorithm ( dmrg3s ) will be presented in section [ sec : dmrg3s ] alongside a comparison with the existing cwf . as both the original perturbation method and the heuristic subspace expansion require a _ mixing factor _",
    "@xmath6,@xcite section [ sec : alpha ] describes how to adaptively choose @xmath6 for fastest convergence .",
    "numerical comparisons and examples will be given in section [ sec : numexps ] .",
    "the notation established here closely follows the review article ref .. consider a state @xmath1 of a system of @xmath7 sites .",
    "each site has a physical state dimension @xmath8 , e.g.  @xmath9 , @xmath10 for a system of @xmath11 @xmath12 spins : @xmath13 in practice , the dimension of the physical basis is usually constant , @xmath14 , but we will keep the subscript to refer to one specific basis on site @xmath15 where necessary .",
    "it is then possible to decompose the coefficients @xmath16 as a series of rank-3 tensors @xmath17 of size @xmath18 respectively , with @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 can then be written as the matrix product of the corresponding matrices in @xmath21 : @xmath22 the maximal dimension @xmath23 is called the _ mps bond dimension_. in typical one - dimensional calculations , @xmath24 , but for e.g.  @xmath25 cylinders , @xmath26 is often necessary .",
    "it is in these numerically demanding cases that our improvements are of particular relevance .",
    "similarly , a hamiltonian operator can be written as a _ matrix product operator _ ( mpo ) , where each tensor @xmath27 is now of rank 4 , namely @xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath30 is called the _ mpo bond dimension_. we will usually assume that for most @xmath15 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in practice , this holds nearly everywhere except at the ends of the chain , where the @xmath33 grow exponentially from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the basis of @xmath36 ( @xmath27 ) of dimension @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is called the left - hand side ( lhs ) basis , whereas the basis of dimension @xmath33 ( @xmath39 ) is the right - hand side ( rhs ) basis of this tensor . for simplicity , @xmath33 , @xmath8 and @xmath39 can also refer to the specific basis ( and not only its dimension ) when unambiguous .    instead of @xmath36 , we will also write @xmath40 ( @xmath41 for a left ( right ) normalised mps tensor : @xmath42",
    "if we then define the contractions @xmath43 we can rewrite @xmath1 from as @xmath44 that is , when only considering one specific bond @xmath45 , the left and right mps bases at this bond are built up from the states generated by the mps tensor chains to the left and right of the bond .",
    "individual elements of an mps basis are therefore called `` state '' .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath46 and @xmath47 with summation over all possible indices .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . with these contractions , it is possible to write @xmath50 for any @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "dmrg then works by _ sweeping _ over the system multiple times . during each sweep ,",
    "each site tensor @xmath36 is sequentially _ updated _ once with each update consisting of one optimisation step via e.g.  a sparse eigensolver and possibly one _ enrichment _ step during which the left or right mps basis of @xmath36 is changed in some way . depending on the exact implementation , updates may work on one ( single - site dmrg ) or two sites ( two - site dmrg ) at a time .",
    "the enrichment step may be missing or implemented via density matrix perturbation or subspace expansion .",
    "during single - site dmrg , only a single mps tensor @xmath36 on site @xmath15 is optimised at once .",
    "compared to two - site dmrg , the search space is reduced by a factor of @xmath52 , leading to a speed - up of at least @xmath53 per iteration.@xcite however , since the left and right bases of the tensors @xmath36 are fixed and defined by the environment ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , this approach is likely to get stuck . while also occurring",
    "if there are no symmetries implemented on the level of the mps , this issue is most easily visible if one considers @xmath56 symmetries:@xcite assume that all basis states to the right of the rhs bond of @xmath36 transform as some quantum number @xmath57 .",
    "if we now target a specific sector , e.g.  @xmath58 overall , then on the lhs of this bond ( i.e.  from the left edge up to and including @xmath36 ) , all states must transform as @xmath59 . in this configuration",
    ", it is impossible for a local change of @xmath36 to add a new state that transforms as , say , @xmath60 , to its right basis states , as there would be no corresponding state @xmath61 to the right of that bond , rendering the addition of the state moot from the perspective of the local optimiser , as its norm will be zero identically .",
    "a concrete example of this issue is given in section [ sec : numexps : stuckspins ] .",
    "dmrg is a variational approach on the state space available to mps of a given bond dimension . as such",
    ", the algorithm must converge into either the global or a local minimum of the energy in this state space .",
    "hence , we will call all cases where dmrg converges on an energy substantially higher than the minimal energy achievable with the allowed mps bond dimension cases where dmrg is stuck in _ local minima_.",
    "this convergence problem has been solved by white ( 2005).@xcite in the following , we will assume a left - to - right sweep , sweeping in the other direction works similarly , but on the left rather than right bonds .",
    "after the local optimisation of the tensor @xmath36 , the reduced density matrix @xmath62 is built on the next bond .",
    "this is the reduced density matrix resulting from tracing out the part of the system to the left of bond @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath63 is then perturbed as @xmath64 the new @xmath65 is then used to decide on a new set of basis states on the rhs of @xmath36 , with the inverse mapping from the new to the old basis being multiplied into each component of @xmath66 .",
    "the mixing factor @xmath6 is a small scalar used to control the perturbation .",
    "a new scheme to find the optimal choice of @xmath6 is discussed in section [ sec : alpha ] .      in a standard single - site dmrg calculation ,",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath63 is never used .",
    "more importantly , even building @xmath63 on a given bond @xmath45 will not yield a density matrix that can be used in , as it only contains the @xmath33 states existing on that bond already without knowledge of the @xmath37 states on the bond one step to the left .",
    "in other words , it is not possible to choose the optimal set @xmath67 based only on @xmath33 , rather , one requires also @xmath8 and @xmath37 .",
    "the centermatrix wavefunction formalism@xcite was developed to cope with this problem .",
    "given a site tensor @xmath68 on a left - to - right sweep , it introduces a `` centermatrix '' @xmath69 and replaces the original site tensor as @xmath70 @xmath40 is constructed to be left - orthogonal and is essentially an identity matrix mapping the left basis @xmath37 and the physical basis @xmath8 onto a complete basis containing all @xmath71 states on its right .",
    "the new basis is `` complete '' in the sense that all states reachable from the left bond basis @xmath37 and the local physical basis @xmath8 are contained within it .    the contents of @xmath36 are placed in @xmath72 accordingly and the original state remains unchanged .",
    "the reduced density matrix is then @xmath73 and has access to all @xmath71 states , as required above .",
    "a perturbation of @xmath63 according to hence allows the introduction of new states .",
    "the dmrg optimisation step can work on @xmath72 alone , with @xmath74 built prior to optimisation of @xmath72 from the expanded @xmath40 . during each eigensolver step ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian on site @xmath15 has to be applied onto @xmath72 .",
    "the application is done by contraction of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath69 at cost @xmath77 per step .",
    "after optimisation , the perturbation is added .",
    "its computational cost is dominated by the calculation of @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "the bond between @xmath40 and @xmath72 can then be truncated down to @xmath35 using @xmath80 and the remaining parts of @xmath72 are multiplied into @xmath66 to the right .",
    "the resulting algorithm converges quickly for one - dimensional problems and performs reasonably well for small cylinders .",
    "however , both the cost of the applications of @xmath0 to @xmath1 as @xmath81 as well as the large density matrix @xmath82 cause problems if @xmath35 and @xmath83 become large .",
    "the idea of using _ subspace expansion _ instead of density matrix perturbation originates @xcite in the tensor train / numerical linear algebra community .",
    "there , a stringent proof was given regarding the convergence properties of this method when the local tensor @xmath84 of the residual @xmath85 is used as the expansion term . here",
    ", we will only use the method of subspace expansion and substitute a numerically much more cheaply available expansion term .",
    "the following section is divided into three parts : firstly , we will explain the concept of subspace expansion acting on two neighbouring mps tensors @xmath36 , @xmath86 .",
    "secondly , the expansion term employed in dmrg3s is introduced and motivated .",
    "thirdly , a simple example is described .      in the following",
    ", we will describe subspace expansion of the rhs basis of the current working tensor , as it would occur during a left - to - right sweep .",
    "assume a state @xmath1 described by a set of tensors @xmath87 .",
    "at the bond @xmath45 , we can then decompose the state as a sum over left and right basis states as in eq .  .",
    "now we _ expand _ the tensor @xmath88 by some expansion term @xmath89 for each individual physical index component : @xmath90 \\quad.\\ ] ] this effectively expands the rhs mps basis of @xmath36 from @xmath33 to @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , expand the components of @xmath92 with zeros : @xmath93 \\quad.\\ ] ] the appropriately - sized block of zeros only multiplies with the expansion term @xmath94 . in terms of a decomposition as in",

    "while the state @xmath1 remains unchanged , the local optimiser on the new site @xmath66 can now choose the initially - zero components differently if so required : the necessary flexibility in the left-/right basis states to escape local minima has been achieved without referring to the density matrix .",
    "note that while orthonormality of @xmath66 is lost , we do not need it between the enrichment step on site @xmath15 and the optimisation step on site @xmath99 .",
    "the orthonormality of @xmath36 can be restored via singular value decomposition as usual .",
    "furthermore , it is usually necessary to truncate the rhs basis of @xmath100 down from @xmath101 to @xmath35 immediately following the expansion : this preserves the most relevant states of the expansion term while avoiding an exponential explosion of bond dimensions .",

    "this exact calculation is hence only possible for @xmath107 , which is far too small to tackle difficult two - dimensional problems .",
    "instead , we propose the very cheaply available terms @xmath108 to be used during left - to - right sweeps and @xmath109 for use during right - to - left sweeps with some scalar mixing factor @xmath6 . in the regime",
    "where the exact residual can be computed , these terms work essentially equally well .    this expression for @xmath97 can be heuristically motivated as follows : is equivalent to the partial projection of latexmath:[$h    current bond . hence , in the ground state and ignoring numerical errors , the rhs basis of this @xmath97 is identical to that of @xmath36 .",
    "truncation from @xmath111 to @xmath33 is then possible without inducing errors .",
    "numerically , it seems possible to choose @xmath6 arbitrarily large without hindering convergence or perturbing the state too much in simple ( one - dimensional ) problems .",
    "however , if the chosen maximal bond dimension @xmath35 is insufficient to faithfully capture the ground state of the given system , @xmath6 has to be taken to zero eventually to allow convergence .",
    "otherwise , @xmath97 will continuously add new states and disturb the result of the eigensolver , which is optimal at this specific value of @xmath35 but not an eigenstate of @xmath0 yet .",
    "the cost of a single subspace expansion is @xmath112 for the calculation of @xmath97 , potentially @xmath113 for the addition to @xmath36 and @xmath66 respectively and @xmath114 for the svd of an @xmath115 matrix formed from @xmath100 .",

    "it is also visible that while some states are removed by dmrg3s without enrichment , it can not add new states : the red squares only occur together with the black filled circles from the input state .",
    "if we enable enrichment via subspace expansion , i.e.  take @xmath199 , dmrg3s quickly converges to a much better ground state at @xmath200 .",

    "as soon as enrichment is enabled , dmrg3s restores @xmath205 symmetry and reflective symmetry over the 10@xmath206 bond and finds a much better ground state . ]      in the following subsections , we will compare the two single - site dmrg algorithms cwf and dmrg3s when applied to four different physical systems : a @xmath12 heisenberg spin chain with periodic boundary conditions , a bosonic system with an optical lattice potential , a fermi - hubbard model at @xmath207 and quarter - filling and a system of free fermions at half - filling .",
    "each algorithm is run at three different values of @xmath208 from the same initial state and run to convergence .",
    "this way , it is possible to both observe the behaviour of the methods at low and high accuracies .    the usual setup in dmrg calculations of starting at small @xmath35 and increasing @xmath35 slowly while the calculation progresses makes it unfortunately very difficult to compare between the three methods .",
    "this is because different methods require different configurations to converge optimally .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to fixed @xmath35 throughout an entire calculation , even though all methods could be sped up further by increasing @xmath35 slowly during the calculation .",
    "errors in energy compared to a numerically exact reference value @xmath209 are plotted as a function of sweeps and cpu time .",
    "it should be stressed that this error in energy is not directly comparable to the truncation error traditionally used in two - site dmrg or the variance @xmath210 sometimes considered in single - site dmrg .",
    "even small differences in energy can lead to vastly different physical states and reaching maximal accuracy in energy is crucial to ensure that the true ground state has been reached .",
    "furthermore , a traditional two - site dmrg ( 2dmrg ) calculation without perturbations is done and its error in energy and runtime to convergence is compared to the two single - site algorithms . here , _",
    "convergence _ is defined as a normalised change in energy less than @xmath211 ( for @xmath212 ) resp .",
    "@xmath213 ( for @xmath214 ) .",
    "the _ runtime to convergence _ is the cpu time used until that energy was output by the eigensolver for the first time .",
    "all calculations were performed on a single core of a xeon e5 - 2650 .",
    "firstly , we consider a @xmath12 heisenberg spin chain with @xmath215 sites and periodic boundary conditions implemented on the level of the hamiltonian as a simple link between the first and last site :    @xmath216    @xmath56 symmetries are exploited and the calculations are forced in the @xmath58 sector .",
    "( colour online ) spin chain eq .  : normalised error in energy as a function of sweeps ( left ) and cpu time used ( right ) of the two single - site algorithms at different @xmath217 .",
    "dmrg3s shows both a speed - up and an improved convergence per sweep compared to cwf , with a long tail of slow convergence very visible for cwf at high accuracies . ]",
    ".[tab : numexps : spinchain]spin chain eq .  :",
    "normalised error in energy at convergence and runtime to convergence of all three methods .",
    "dmrg3s is consistently faster than cwf , whereas the energies provided by 2dmrg are not comparable in accuracy .",

    ", most other parameters are identical ( @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath35 ) or very close ( @xmath83 ) to those in the fermi - hubbard model from section  [ sec : numexps : fermi - hubbard ] .",
    "the calculation is done using @xmath219 and @xmath220 symmetries at half - filling with @xmath221 fermions and @xmath203 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 is the same as for the fermi - hubbard system , namely @xmath222 .",
    "we used @xmath223 as the reference value , since all methods converged to this ground - state energy at @xmath224 .",
    "the results in tab .",
    "[ tab : numexps : fermions ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : numexps : fermions ] mostly follow the previous results for locally interacting systems : accuracies of all methods are essentially identical , whereas time to convergence varies between the methods . at small @xmath35 , there are some speed - ups of dmrg3s over cwf , largely due to better convergence behaviour per sweep , whereas a significant advantage of dmrg3s becomes visible at larger @xmath35 , when numerical operations become cheaper compared to the cwf method .",
    "correspondingly , the speed - up from cwf to dmrg3s increases from @xmath225 at @xmath226 to @xmath227 at @xmath224 .",
    "similarly , the larger numerical cost of two - site dmrg becomes more noticeable at larger @xmath35 , with the speed - up between 2dmrg and dmrg3s increasing from @xmath228 at @xmath226 to more than @xmath229 at @xmath224 .",
    "compared to the non - critical fermi - hubbard system from section  [ sec : numexps : fermi - hubbard ] , we observe larger errors in energy at fixed @xmath35 , as expected .",
    "correspondingly , as more eigenvalues contribute significantly , convergence of both the eigenvalue solver and the singular value decompositions becomes slower , leading to a slow - down of all three methods .",
    "the new strictly single - site dmrg ( dmrg3s ) algorithm results in a theoretical speed - up of @xmath230 during the optimisation steps compared to the centermatrix wavefunction formalism ( cwf ) , provided that @xmath231 is small .",
    "further , convergence rates per sweep are improved in the important and computationally most expensive high - accuracy / large-@xmath35 phase of the calculation .",
    "in addition , auxiliary calculations ( enrichment , normalisation , etc . ) are sped up and memory requirements are relaxed .",
    "numerical experiments confirm a speed - up within the theoretical expectations compared to the cwf method .",
    "the efficiency of single - site dmrg in general compared to the traditional two - site dmrg was substantiated further by a large speed - up at comparable accuracies in energy .",
