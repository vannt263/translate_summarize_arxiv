    "quantum coherence is a phenomenon that could have profound impact on technological development .",
    "usually understood to appear in temperature regimes much lower than those encountered in everyday practice , quantum coherence effects are not directly utilized in the operation of most conventional devices . superconducting sensors , magnets and transmission cables are examples where macroscopic quantum coherence is maintained at relatively high temperature .",
    "nonetheless , even the highest-@xmath0 materials currently remain in the realm of cryogenic temperatures , thus significantly hampering their potential applicability .",
    "consequently , much effort has been expended in the quest for higher temperature materials , as room - temperature superconductivity remains one of the most prominent issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "although recent experimental evidence may suggest that superconductivity is possible at room temperature @xcite , what is perhaps even more compelling is the emerging evidence that photosynthetic systems found in nature may have already evolved a means of exploiting quantum coherence effects at physiological temperatures @xcite . due to the broad array of organisms sustained by trapping",
    "then converting sunlight into chemical energy , photosynthesis is probably the cleanest , most efficient energy collection mechanism on earth , perhaps making high - temperature quantum coherence far more ubiquitous than previously thought .",
    "central to the understanding of temperature - dependent quantum coherence is the decoherence or thermalization of quantum systems with their surrounding environment . in the well - known work of caldeira and leggett @xcite , the feynman - vernon influence functional approach @xcite",
    "is used to model a thermalizing environment with the purpose of introducing decoherence into a quantum oscillator . following the same path integral approach , it is demonstrated that a thermalizing environment need not always lead to decoherence in the steady - state .",
    "arriving at this result requires the realization that because the reservoir can not excite energies too far in excess of its mean thermal energy , a temperature cutoff must be introduced . as a result , low - temperature environments are found to thermalize the quantum oscillator to the usual boltzmann distribution of energy levels , whereas higher - temperature regimes induce a single , coherent oscillator ground state with an imaginary frequency .",
    "since the concomitant imaginary energy eigenvalues correspond to decay rates , all excited states become more unstable with increasing quantum number . in this way",
    ", environments in this higher - temperature regime damp out the excitations by extracting energy from the quantum oscillator , forcing the oscillator to remain in the stable , coherent ground state . increasing to very high environmental temperatures once again",
    "thermalizes the quantum oscillator in the usual way",
    ".    in short , a dissipative environment can cause a suppression or damping of excited modes , thus acting to maintain quantum coherence even at relatively high temperatures .",
    "this result may underpin recent observations of room - temperature superconducting effects in water - treated graphite grains @xcite .",
    "finally , given their emergence and subsequent disappearance of quantum coherence with increasing temperature , photosynthetic molecules most remarkably follow the qualitative behavior described here @xcite .",
    "depicted schematically in fig.[qq ] , a quantum harmonic oscillator , initially at some temperature @xmath1 , linearly coupled to an environmental reservoir .",
    "ultimately the environment will be modeled as a collection of oscillators at temperature @xmath2 , but we first consider the case of a single - oscillator reservoir , carrying out integrals over a continuum later . acquiring the steady - state of the quantum harmonic oscillator",
