    "nb@xmath0se@xmath1 can be regarded as an aggregate of one - dimensional chains that are weakly coupled through josephson - type junctions since the distance between the nb atoms in a chain is metallic but the interchain distance exceeds the metallic distance .",
    "the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for current i @xmath19 b - axis ( @xmath20 - perpendicular to nb chains ) is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the onset temperature t@xmath69 is the same for both @xmath18 and @xmath20 ,  however @xmath20 shows zero resistivity only at bulk t@xmath2 and a feature indicating another superconducting transition at t = 2.2 k that is visible in applied magnetic field up to 1koe .",
    "an alternative explanation for this is a small misorientation in the current direction during electrical transport measurement perpendicular to the nb chains .",
    "however that would imply the presence of two t@xmath2 s in two different electronic substructures and negligible interband scattering.@xcite    @xmath70",
    "in summary , we have showed bulk superconductivity , and have investigated the anisotropy in electrical transport properties in the normal and in the superconducting state of nb@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "our results show that nb@xmath0se@xmath1 is in the intermediate to large coupling limit of  bcs theory with a possible large mean - squared anisotropy of the energy gap on the fermi surface .    more microscopic measurements such as nmr , neutron scattering and tunneling experiments would be very useful to quantify the question of possible filamentary superconducitivity above bulk t@xmath2 or multiband features .",
