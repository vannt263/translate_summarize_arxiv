    "in the operation of liquid crystal devices the phenomena of fredericksz transitions in nematic liquid crystal cells are of paramount technological importance ( * ? ? ?",

    "a nematic liquid crystal cell is basically a thin layer ( a few microns ) of a nematic liquid crystal contained between two glass plates whose inner surface is chemically treated in such a way as to force a certain allignment ( anchoring ) of the rod like nematic liquid crystal molecules lying close to the cell boundary .",
    "this surface alignment induces an allignment in the liquid crystal molecules filling the cell bulk so that the total free energy is minimized .    when an exterior electric or magnetic field is applied to the cell a competition takes place between the reorienting effects of the field and the allignment imposed by the surface anchoring .",
    "minimization of the total free energy ( field , elastic bulk , and anchoring ) then forces a reallignment of the molecules in the cell bulk ( and , in the case of the so called weak anchoring conditions , also of those at the cell surface @xcite ) when the field intensity increases above a threshold value dependent on the physico - chemical characteristics of the device .",
    "this bifurcation phenomenon is called fredericksz transition , in honor of the soviet physicist who discovered it @xcite .",
    "if we model the rod - like nematic liquid crystal molecules by a `` director vector field '' @xmath1 with @xmath2 a system with strong anchoring of the molecules at the cell surface occupying a region @xmath3 has a total free energy of the director field given by @xmath4 where the free - energy density @xmath5 embodies the competition between the energy cost of distortions of the director field versus the energy reduction associated with aligning parallel ( or perpendicular ) to the magnetic field , and is givem by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are phenomenological elastic constants , @xmath10 is the free - space magnetic permeability , @xmath11 is the difference between the diamagnetic susceptibilities parallel to versus perpendicular to the director , and @xmath12 is the ( constant ) applied magnetic field .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we consider the geometry of the twist - fredericksz transition , with an asymmetric pre - twist at the boundary .",
    "thus we consider a thin slab of nematic liquid crystal bounded by two parallel planes a distance @xmath13 apart from each other , unbounded and extending to infinity in any direction parallel to these planes .",
    "define a positively oriented orthogonal coordinate system @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is perpendicular to the bounding planes .",
    "let the director field be represented by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the ( twist ) angle of the director .",
    "we will assume that in the liquid crystal cell the director is fixed in opposing orientations @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the two opposing planes bounding the device in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "this induces a net twist of the director vector field @xmath20 across the cell ( see figure  [ figlccell ] ) .",
    "[ figlccell ]     orientation inside the cell corresponds to the situation in branch @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) in section  3.1 below . ]",
    "we will consider a magnetic vector field @xmath12 applied along the constant direction @xmath23 with intensity @xmath24 and are interested in studying the effect it induces in the stationary director distribution , according to the ericksen - leslie theory @xcite",
    ".    in terms of the angle representation [ eqn : nhat ] , the simplest model for the dynamics of the director field in the absence of flow is the gradient flow on the _ free energy _ of the system and , in dimensionless form , the initial - boundary value problem governing the behaviour of the director field is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 with all the material parameters are positive for our system of interest . observe that the dimensionless control parameter @xmath27 is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength .    the associated equilibrium problem is given by @xmath28    in the classical twist - fredericksz - transition problem , we have @xmath29 the system possesses a simple symmetry , @xmath30 and the ground - state solution ( @xmath31 , which is invariant under this symmetry ) loses stability to a pair of symmetric solutions at a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath32    in @xcite a system with antisymmetric pre - twist ( @xmath33 ) was studied .",
    "we no longer have the simple symmetry above .",
    "the problem still possesses @xmath34 symmetry , however it is now of the form @xmath35 .",
    "the ground - state solution ( which is invariant under this symmetry ) is no longer uniform .",
    "the problem still has a classical pitchfork bifurcation diagram , with the symmetric solution branch bifurcating at a value @xmath36 , which is necessarily greater than @xmath37 as was showed in @xcite .",
    "observe that the antisymmetric nature of the boundary data is crucial to this scenario .",
    "in the present paper we consider the asymmetric case ( @xmath38 both nonzero ) .",
    "we conclude that no pitchfork bifurcation points remain : the pitchforks that had not been broken in the passage from the classical twist cenario to the antisymmetric one , are now broken when the @xmath39 becomes different from @xmath40 and the result is a bifurcation diagram with only saddle - node bifurcation points , branches emanating from them , and single nonbifurcating branch of solutions .",
    "the approach will be based on the time maps and phase - plane methods developed in @xcite for the antisymmetric case .",
    "the stability of these branches is also studied by applying the results of @xcite , also based on the behaviour of time - maps , which allows the classification of the stationary solution branches as stable , asymptotically stable , or unstable",
    ". a more detailed study of the stability indices of the equilibria and the characterization of their connecting orbits will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we will be concerned with the stationary solutions to ( [ eq1+])-([eq1 # # ] ) , i.e. , solutions of ( [ * ] ) - ( [ * * ] ) .",

    "two other time maps will be needed .",

    "the same holds true for @xmath103",
    "the study of - in the symmetric case @xmath54 was done in @xcite and will serve as a guide to our present study . in the symmetric case a special role is played by the solutions of - that additionally satisfy the homogeneous neumann boundary condition @xmath104 ( note that @xmath105 ) . the values of @xmath0 for which these solutions occur were termed `` critical '' ( cf .",
