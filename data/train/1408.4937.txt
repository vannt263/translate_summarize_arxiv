    "the full crossover was studied using numerical renormalization group .",
    "the situation with an arbitrary number of leads of interacting electrons was studied in refs .  , where in addition an interaction - induced intermediate - coupling unstable fixed point was discovered .",
    "the topological protection of this novel kondo effect opens new possibilities for the experimental observation of multi - channel kondo impurity dynamics .",
    "@xcite additional physical effects can be observed when including a josephson coupling to the mesoscopic island hosting the majorana bound states ; phase fluctuations then cause a non - trivial interplay between topological kondo and resonant andreev reflection processes , giving a continuous manifold of stable non - fermi liquid states .",

    "hence for realistic values @xmath9 , we have a diverging ldos in the zero - bias limit close to the junction .",
    "in contrast to the usual picture of a power - law vanishing of the low - energy ldos in a luttinger liquid with or without boundary / impurity , @xcite an interaction - induced divergence is in fact a rather generic feature of luttinger - liquid wire junctions , @xcite and luttinger - liquid junctions with a superconductor , with @xcite or without @xcite majorana bound states . the key feature of the so@xmath3(@xmath1 ) topological kondo effect of ref .",
