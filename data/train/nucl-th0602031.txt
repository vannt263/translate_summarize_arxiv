    "the full analysis of the scissors mode in the framework of a solvable model ( harmonic oscillator with quadrupole  quadrupole residual interaction ( ho+qq ) ) was given in @xcite .",
    "several points in the understanding of the nature of this mode were clarified : for example , its coexistence with the isovector giant quadrupole resonance ( ivgqr ) , the decisive role of the fermi surface deformation , and several things more . the wigner function moments ( wfm )",
    "method was applied to derive analytical expressions for currents of both coexisting modes , their excitation energies , magnetic and electric transition probabilities .",
    "our formulae for energies turned out to be identical with those derived by hamamoto and nazarewicz @xcite in the framework of the rpa .",
    "however , little details are given in that reference of letter form .",
    "in @xcite we investigated the relation between formulas for transition probabilities derived by the two methods .",
    "it was shown there , that also these formulas are identical .",
    "this coincidence motivated us to undertake a systematic comparison of the two approaches and to understand the connection and differences between them .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "one of the important subjects of this comparison are the current distributions .",
    "the wfm method , a priori , can not give the exact results , because it deals only with integrals over the whole phase space .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting to evaluate the accuracy of this approximation by comparing the results with the currents obtained from rpa .",
    "unfortunately , even for this simple model ( ho+qq ) it is impossible to derive in rpa the closed analytical expressions for currents of the scissors mode and ivgqr .",
    "that is why we consider in addition the green s function ( gf ) method , which allows one to find explicit expressions for the currents directly .",
    "the ho+qq model is a very convenient ground for this kind of investigation , because all results can be obtained analytically .",
    "there is no need to describe the merits of the rpa or of the gf method  they are very well known @xcite .",
    "it is necessary , however , to say a few words about the wfm .",
    "its idea is based on the virial theorems of chandrasekhar and lebovitz @xcite . instead of writing the equations of motion for microscopic amplitudes of particle hole excitations ( rpa ) ,",
    "one writes the dynamical equations for various multipole phase space moments of a nucleus .",
    "this allows one to achieve a more direct physical interpretation of the studied phenomenon without going into its detailed microscopic structure .",
    "the wfm method was successfully applied to the study of isoscalar and isovector giant multipole resonances and low - lying collective modes of rotating and nonrotating nuclei with various realistic forces @xcite .",
    "the results of wfm were always very close to similar results obtained with the help of rpa . in principle , this should be expected , because the basis of both methods is the same : time dependent hartree ",
    "fock ( tdhf ) theory in its small amplitude approximation . on the other hand",
    "it is evident , that they are in general not equivalent , because the truncation scheme is different .",
    "the detailed analysis of the interplay of the two methods turns out to be useful also from a  practical \" point of view : first and most importantly it allows one to obtain additional insight into the nature of the scissors mode ; second we find new exact mathematical results for the considered model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the principal points of the wfm formalism and give a summary of the key results of @xcite obtained by applying this method to the ho+qq model .",
    "the same model is considered in section 3 in the frame of rpa : the formulae for eigenfrequencies , electric and magnetic transition probabilities of the scissors mode are derived , the  synthetic \" scissors and spurious state are analyzed .",
    "the exact interrelation between the rpa and wfm methods and between their variables is established in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to the gf method .",
    "the three methods are applied to derive analytical formulae for lines of currents in section 6 .",
    "the mutual interplay of the three methods is discussed in the conclusion .",
    "various mathematical details are given in appendices a and b.",

    "it is shown in @xcite , that by integrating equation ( [ fsin ] ) over the phase space @xmath7 with the weights @xmath8 , where @xmath9 runs from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , one can obtain a closed finite set of dynamical equations for cartesian tensors of the rank @xmath11 . taking linear combinations of these equations",
    "one is able to represent them through irreducible tensors , which play the role of collective variables of the problem .",
    "however , it is more convenient to derive the dynamical equations directly for irreducible tensors using the technique of tensor products @xcite . for this",

    "we find that the frequency of ivgqr ( being determined mainly by the neutron - proton interaction ) is changed not very much : @xmath90 comparing this formula ( for @xmath80 ) with ( [ omeg2fin ] ) one sees , that in the limit of small deformation one obtains @xmath91 instead of @xmath92 .",
    "one should recall that also for the isovector giant dipole resonance the distortion of fermi sphere plays only a minor role .",
    "it is also easy to see that omitting @xmath89 in ( [ scis1 ] ) , one obtains zero energy for the scissors mode independent of the strength of the residual interaction .",

    "the expression in the last curly brackets coincides obviously with the secular equation ( [ secul1 ] ) that proves the orthogonality of the spurious state to all physical states of the considered model .",

    "it is necessary to make some assumption concerning the relation between neutron and proton equilibrium characteristics . as usual , we apply the approximation ( [ apr4 ] ) , i.e. , suppose @xmath236 .",

    "so we get @xmath241 the estimation of the overlap for @xmath242gd with @xmath243 gives @xmath244 and @xmath245 ( see eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) ) , that is two times larger than the result of @xcite obtained in qrpa calculations with the skyrme forces . the disagreement can naturally be attributed to the difference in forces and especially to the lack of pair correlations in our approach .    in the small deformation limit @xmath246",
    "this is the maximum possible overlap of the `` pure '' ( or `` synthetic '' ) scissors with the real scissors .",
    "increasing @xmath71 and /or taking into account pairing correlations decreases its value , that is confirmed by numerous microscopic calculations with various forces @xcite .",
    "such small overlap leads inevitably to the conclusion , that the original model of counter rotating rigid rotors @xcite has not very much in common with the real scissors mode , the correct description of which requires the proper treatment of the fermi surface deformation and the coupling with ivgqr .",
    "a certain drawback of our approach is that , so far , we have not included the superfluidity into our description . on the other hand , our formulae ( [ omeg2fin ] , [ bm1gen ] )",
    "can be successfully used for the description of superdeformed nuclei where the pairing is very weak @xcite .",
    "for example , applying them to the superdeformed nucleus @xmath247dy ( @xmath248 ) , we get @xmath249 for the isovector gqr and @xmath250 for the scissors mode",
    ". there are not many results of other calculations to compare with . as a matter of fact",
    ", there are only two papers considering this problem .",
    "the phenomenological trm model @xcite predicts @xmath251 the only existing microscopic calculation @xcite in the framework of qrpa with separable forces gives @xmath252 here @xmath253 denotes the total @xmath254 orbital strength carried by the calculated @xmath255 qrpa excitations modes in the energy region below 20 mev .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case of ivgqr one can speak , at least , about qualitative agreement .",
    "our results for @xmath256 and @xmath257 are in good agreement with that of phenomenological model and with @xmath256 and @xmath253 of hamamoto and nazarewicz .",
    "it is possible to extract from the histogram of @xcite the value of the overlap of calculated low - lying @xmath258 excitations with the synthetic scissors state : @xmath259 the result of our calculation @xmath260 agrees with it very well .",
    "so , the comparison of our calculations with that of qrpa shows , that we have excellent agreement in superdeformed nuclei and rather large disagreement in moderately deformed nuclei . on the other hand it is known @xcite , that pairing is very weak at the superdeformation and becomes important at moderate deformations .",
    "therefore , as a consequence the correct treatment of pair correlations is important for an accurate description of the scissors mode . this shall be the subject of future work .",
    "in this section we want to establish the precise relation between the wfm and rpa methods .",
    "though it can be guessed that working in both cases with the full configuration space , i.e. with a complete set of particle and hole states in the case of rpa and with all moments of all ranks in the case of wfm , identical results shall be obtained , it is still important to study the detailes of this relation because the behaviour of wfm and rpa under truncation of the space turns out to be radically different . the exact relations between the rpa amplitudes @xmath261 and @xmath262 and the respective wfm variables can be established with the help of the linear response theory .",
    "let us consider the response of the system to a weak external time - dependent field @xmath263 with @xmath264 .",
    "the linear response is then given by @xcite : @xmath265w_{k'q'},\\ ] ] where @xmath266 is the rpa response function @xcite and the index pairs @xmath267 and @xmath268 are restricted to particle hole and hole particle pairs .",
    "indices @xmath269 include spin and isospin quantum numbers @xmath270 and @xmath3 . for the change of the average value of an arbitrary operator we have :",
    "@xmath271    we now are ready to analyze the wfm variables .",
    "the first one is @xmath272 using here definitions of the wigner function , the @xmath71-function and the density matrix @xcite @xmath273 we find @xmath274 i.e. this is just the ground state expectation value of the operator @xmath275 . in accordance with ( [ varf ] ) the variation of this variable is @xmath276 where @xmath277    equation ( [ deltar ] ) demonstrates in an obvious way the structure of the variables @xmath278 .",
    "they are linear combinations of the transition matrix elements @xmath279 which are , in turn , linear combinations of the rpa amplitudes @xmath280 . introducing the notation @xmath281 and @xmath282 we can proceed in a similar way with @xmath283 and @xmath284    inserting the expressions for @xmath285 into the first equation of the set ( [ quadr ] ) we find @xmath286 it is sufficient to consider only the part with the @xmath287 time dependence . multiplying this equation by @xmath288 and taking the limit @xmath289 we find the equation @xmath290 which can be called as the dynamical equation for the transition matrix element @xmath279 .",
    "naturally , in the same way the dynamical equations for transition matrix elements @xmath291 and @xmath292 can be extracted from the second and third ( linearized ) equations of ( [ quadr ] ) .",
    "now we can show , that exactly the same dynamical equations for transition matrix elements ( tme ) can be derived from rpa equations . to this end",
    "we combine the rpa equations ( [ dd ] ) with the definition ( [ matelem ] ) of matrix elements : @xmath293 taking into account the relations @xmath294_{im},\\quad \\epsilon_{mi}f_{mi}=-[\\hat f , h_0]_{mi},\\quad\\ ] ] one rewrites this equation as @xmath295_{im}x_{mi}^{\\tau,{\\nu } } + [ \\hat f^{\\tau},h_0^{\\tau}]_{mi}y_{mi}^{\\tau,{\\nu}}+ k^{\\tau}_{\\nu}(f_{im}^{\\tau}\\q_{im}^{\\tau * } -f_{mi}^{\\tau}\\q_{mi}^{\\tau*})\\}.\\ ] ] the hamiltonian of the axially deformed harmonic oscillator corresponding to the mean field ( [ potenirr ] ) is @xmath296    let us consider the operator @xmath297 calculating the commutator @xmath298=i\\hbar\\frac{2}{m}(r\\hat p)_{21}\\ ] ] we find from ( [ equmot2 ] ) the following equation @xmath299 taking into account relations @xmath300 and @xmath301 we find , that the last sum in ( [ equd ] ) is equal to zero . applying again formula ( [ matelem ] ) we write ( [ equd ] ) as @xmath302 reproducing equation ( [ tme ] ) . the dynamical equations for @xmath303 and @xmath304 are obtained in a similar way by considering the operators @xmath305 and @xmath306 respectively .",
    "as it could be expected , the resulting equations reproduce the corresponding tme equations derived from ( [ quadr ] ) with the help of the limit procedure .",
    "so , there exists one - to - one correspondence between the set of dynamical equations for wfm variables and the set of dynamical equations for transition matrix elements ( tme ) .",
    "this correspondence makes obvious the fact that both sets have the same eigenvalues . on the other hand",
    "the tme equations are just linear combinations of the rpa equations .",
    "therefore we can conclude that rpa and wfm approaches generate identical eigenvalues . in this sense",
    "both approaches are equivalent in all aspects .",
    "this concerns for instance also the transition probabilities",
    ". however , for this equivalence to be exact , one needs to work in the full space in both approaches , that is in the complete particle hole space in rpa and taking all phase space moments of all powers in wfm , a task which can hardly be tackled in general .",
    "the difference of the two approaches then shows up if truncations of the dimension of the equations have to be operated . in rpa one",
    "usually solves the equations with a restricted number of discrete particle hole pairs , i.e. the dimension of the rpa matrix is finite ( in some works the rpa equations for finite nuclei are , however , solved in full space , including continuum states @xcite ) .",
    "the result of such a diagonalisation usually yields a huge number of discrete eigenvalues approximating more or less the spectrum one would obtain from a solution in the full space .",
    "for instance resonances in the continuum ( e.g. giant resonances ) will be mocked up by a bunch of discrete states whose envelope may simulate the full solution . reducing the dimension of the particle hole space too much may lead to a situation where the full solution is only approximated rather badly and in an uncontrolled manner .    in the wfm method the dynamical equations for cartesian tensors of the rank @xmath19",
    "are coupled ( by the interaction terms in ( [ sincyclic ] ) ) with dynamical equations for tensors of the rank @xmath307 , these equations being coupled with the ones for tensors of the rank @xmath308 and so on up to @xmath309 . here one hopes that the essential part of physics is described by a small number of the lowest ranks tensors .",
    "the hope is based on the assumption that the higher rank tensors ( moments ) are responsible for the more refined details and that neglecting them does not appreciably influence the description of the more global physics which is described with the lower ranks tensors .",
    "this assumption is substantiated in past applications of the wfm method to realistic situations with skyrme forces for the description of collective nuclear modes @xcite . in those works",
    "it has indeed been demonstrated that even with a very limited number of low rank phase space moments one can faithfully reproduce the centroid position of the collective states . in this sense",
    "the wfm method is rather similar to the sum rule approach which works , however , only in the cases when practically all strength is exhausted by one state , whereas wfm method works also in situations when the strength is distributed among a few excitations . from these studies",
    "it is then permitted to assume that the inclusion of higher and higher rank moments will just give raise to a refinement of the gross structure obtained with the low rank tensors .",
    "a formal convergence study of this type has been performed in the infinite matter case @xcite where it was indeed shown that the moment method allows to approach the full solution in an optimized way .",
    "the net result is , that wfm and rpa approximate the exact infinite spectrum into a finite number of eigenfrequencies with , however , different convergence .",
    "an analogous situation occurs with transition probabilities .",
    "let us analyze , for example , the expression ( [ deltar ] ) for the wfm variable @xmath310 . using the definition ( [ cnu ] ) of @xmath311 with the external field operator @xmath312 , we find @xmath313 the summation limit @xmath314 depends on the method of calculation . in the case of the exact solution @xmath315 , for rpa @xmath314 is usually of",
    "the order of several @xmath316 , for wfm @xmath314 usually is not more than around @xmath317 @xmath318 . naturally , the eigenvalues @xmath319 and eigenstates @xmath98 are different in each case .",
    "so , the strength , that in rpa was distributed over hundreds or thousands levels , in wfm is concentrated only on several levels , i.e. averaging of levels is accompanied by the redistribution of the strength .",
    "the variable @xmath320 is the quantum mechanical observable , so its value should not depend on the basis @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the right hand sides of ( [ strength ] ) , calculated by two methods , should coincide if both methods are mutually consistent .",
    "this statement can e.g. be checked with the help of sum rules . generally in rpa sum rules",
    "are well fulfilled for a sufficiently large particle hole space which in realistic cases can become quite significant , whereas in wfm sum rules are generally already well fulfilled even with a small number of low rank moments ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the essential difference between wfm and rpa methods lies in their practical use .",
    "the rpa equations ( [ rpa ] ) are constructed in such a way that the increase in dimension does not cause any formal problems and finally it is only a question of computer power what dimension can be handled .",
    "quite on the contrary the increase of dimension in wfm is a nontrivial task .",
    "beyond a certain order of the moments even the reduction of cartesian tensors to the irreducible ones becomes a very difficult task .",
    "however , the spirit of wfm is rather to reproduce the gross structure of a couple of prominent collective states , a situation which it can handle very efficiently .",
    "however , in cases where there is strong fragmentation , direct diagonalisation of the standard rpa equations is more efficient .    in conclusion wfm and rpa",
    "are equivalent when the full particle hole configuration space in rpa and the infinite number of moments in wfm are considered .",
    "however , under truncation of the spaces both methods have different convergence properties . in the general case for wfm",
    "only a few moments are sufficient to get the correct gross structure of the collective part of the spectrum , whereas in rpa one in general must take into account a quite large configuration space to produce reasonable results .",
    "one of the important subjects of comparing rpa and wfm methods are the current distributions .",
    "the wfm method , a priori , can not give the exact results , because it deals only with integrals over the whole phase space .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting to evaluate the accuracy of this approximation by comparing it with the exact result .",
    "unfortunately , even for the simple model ho+qq it is impossible to derive in rpa closed analytical expressions for currents of the scissors mode and ivgqr .",
    "that is why we consider in this section the green s function ( gf ) method , which allows one to find explicit expressions for the currents directly .    following the paper of h. kohl , p. schuck and s. stringari @xcite we will consider at first the isoscalar case . conserving on the right hand side of equation ( [ fsin ] ) only the first term of the sin - function expansion leads to the vlasov equation @xmath321 in our case the wigner transform @xmath322 coincides with the classical hamiltonian @xmath323 . having in mind small amplitude vibrations we have to linearize ( [ vlasov ] ) : @xmath324 , @xmath325 with @xmath326 being the solution of the time independent equation .",

    "this fact allows one to construct the differential equations for current fields .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the curve is an ellipse for the scissors mode and it is a hyperbola for ivgqr ( see figs 1,2 ) .",
    "it was shown also , that the real motion of the scissors mode is a mixture of rotational and irrotational behaviour . to get a quantitative measure for the contribution of each kind of motion , it is sufficient to write the displacement @xmath414 as the superposition of a rotational component with the coefficient @xmath317 and an irrotational one with the coefficient @xmath415 @xcite : @xmath416 comparing the components @xmath417 with @xmath418 in ( [ displac ] ) we find @xmath419    where @xmath420",
    "so , for the scissors mode in the small @xmath71 limit we have @xmath421 i.e. the current of the scissors mode is dominated by rotational motion .",
    "the contributions of the two kinds of motion to the ivgqr are @xmath422 i.e. the current of the ivgqr is dominated by irrotational motion .",
    "transitions currents are calculated in wfm analogously to transition probabilities .",

    "of course , it is clear that in the case of @xmath102 close enough to @xmath319 the main contribution into @xmath429 comes from the single matrix element @xmath430 .",

    "obviously , this expression coincides exactly with formula ( [ curfield ] ) .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize the principal point : the result ( [ curgren ] ) is obtained from the gf method in a direct way , whereas deriving formula ( [ curfield ] ) we made the strong approximation about truncating the expansion ( [ displ ] ) which parametrizes the displacements .",
    "the agreement of both expressions tells us about the internal consistency of the various approaches to obtain the gross structure of the flow patterns .      in conclusion in full rpa",
    "one must calculate the currents numerically leading to fine details ( shell effects ) whereas in wfm and gf treatments one obtains their gross structure with analytical formulas .",
    "the latter feature is quite important in order to understand the real character of the motion under study since current patterns produced numerically from complicated formulas with a lot of summations like in ( [ trcurr ] ) can hardly be interpreted physically .",
    "a good example is the interplay of the scissors mode and the isovector giant quadrupole resonance . looking only at the flow patterns ( see figs",
    ". 1 , 2 ) one would not be able to tell that the former is mostly rotational with a small amount of an irrotational component and the other way round for the latter , as this can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ flowsc ] , [ flowgr ] ) .",
    "in this paper we made an exhaustive comparison of different methods to treat collective excitations in nuclei , like the scissors mode , isovector and isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances .",
    "this comparison was exemplified on the h.o . plus",
    "separable quadrupole  quadrupole force model",
    "but it has more general character .",
    "we investigated wfm , rpa and green s function ( gf ) methods . under certain circumstances",
    "all three methods give essentially the same results .",
    "for example all methods give in our model the same analytical expressions for energies and transition probabilities for all the excitations considered .",
    "it turned out that wfm and gf methods are very close to one another .",
    "contrary to rpa , both work in phase space and incorporate semiclassical aspects , with no need to introduce a single particle basis .",
    "finally both methods yield identical sets of dynamical equations for the moments .",
    "however , in the case of realistic forces the gf method loses its simplicity and the more complicated pseudo particle method has to be applied , whereas the wfm method continues to be a convenient and powerful tool for the description of the collective motions as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite employing skyrme forces .    to show the analytical equivalence between wfm and rpa methods one needs to introduce the dynamical equations for the transition matrix elements .",
    "they can be derived either from the rpa equations for the amplitudes @xmath454 or from the wfm dynamical equations for the moments .",
    "this proves the identity of eigenvalues in both methods under the condition that a complete basis is used in both cases .",
    "however , both methods behave differently when the dimension of the space is reduced .",
    "actually wfm is designed to use only rather few moments of low rank .",
    "the restricted number of eigenvalues approximate the collective states in an optimal way , representing e.g. their centroid positions , as this was shown in @xcite . in this sense wfm",
    "has similarity with the sum rule approach @xcite which works , however , only in the cases when practically all strength is exhausted by one state , whereas wfm method works also in situations when the strength is distributed among several excitations . on the contrary in rpa",
    "one needs in general a rather large space to correctly account for the collectivity of e.g. the giant resonances . at the same time",
    "a certain fine structure of the resonances is also obtained . concerning the spectrum",
    "both methods are thus complementary .",
    "the situation is different for the currents and flow patterns .",
    "since rpa is a fully quantal approach , the current lines can even in our simplified model be calculated only numerically .",
    "they show a complicated pattern due to the shell effects . without further efforts one will not be able to analyze the nature of the flows .",
    "a good example is given in our model with the low and high lying scissors mode ( the latter being the ivgqr ) .",
    "due to the analytic formulas found with wfm and gf methods which naturally lead to smooth current distributions free of rapidly fluctuating behavior from shell effects , we were able to show that the low lying scissors mode is mostly rotational with a slight admixture of an irrotational component and the other way round for the ivgqr .",
    "in addition to our earlier work we investigated in detail the so called synthetic scissors mode which is based on the picture of two counter rotating proton and neutron mass distributions . calculating the overlap of this synthetic scissors mode with the real one we could show that the squared overlap amounts only to about 60% in the best of all cases .",
    "we also showed explicitly the orthogonality of the spurious mode to all other `` intrinsic '' excitations of the model .",
    "future work in this direction shall be concerned with the scissors mode in neutron rich nuclei and with the consideration of superfluidity .",

    "it is obtained quite easily by summing the expressions for @xmath455 and @xmath456 ( formula ( [ poten ] ) ) : @xmath457 in the state of equilibrium ( i.e. , in the absence of an external field ) @xmath458 . using the definition @xcite @xmath459 and the formula",
