    "the data presented here were taken in 1994 and onwards at the @xmath11 collider hera using the h1 and zeus detectors . during this period hera operated with positrons of energy @xmath12  gev and protons with energy @xmath13  gev .",

    "the resulting gluon distributions show a clear rise with decreasing @xmath5 and have a 15% uncertainty at @xmath37 these nlo qcd fits are also in good agreement with the global qcd analyses performed by mrs  @xcite and cteq  @xcite , whilst the prediction from the dynamical evolution of grv  @xcite is too steep for @xmath38",
    "the @xmath25 measurements fail to distinguish between dglap and the bfkl approach to the qcd evolution .",
    "the hadronic final states are expected to give additional information . for events at low @xmath33 hadron production between the current jet and the proton remnant",
    "is expected to be sensitive to the effects of bfkl or dglap dynamics .",
    "a possible signature of bfkl dynamics is the behaviour of dis events at low @xmath5 which contain a jet that has a transverse momentum @xmath39 ( so minimizing the phase space available for dglap evolution ) and has longitudinal momentum fraction ( of the proton ) @xmath40 that is large ( in order to maximise the phase space for bfkl evolution ) , fig  [ fig : ladder ] .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : fjets ] shows that both experiments observe a forward jet cross section which rises steeply with decreasing @xmath5 with substantially more forward jet events than expected from nlo qcd ( labelled as born in fig .",
    "[ fig : fjets]a . ) a bfkl calculation ( the stars ) gives a better agreement with the data .",
    "the overall normalisation in this calculation is uncertain and the agreement may be fortuitous . indeed , it should also be noted that both experiments observe more centrally produced dijet events than predicted by the nlo qcd calculations .",
    "the ariadne monte carlo ( cdm ) model describes the steeply increasing jet cross section with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "the ariadne model does not have a strong ordering in transverse momentum in the qcd cascade , akin to bfkl type dynamics , although it does not make explicit use of the bfkl equation . whilst those models that adhere to the dglap formalism ( lepto and herwig ) fail to predict this large growth .",
    "further careful investigation is necessary before claiming that bfkl is the mechanism for this enhanced forward jet production .",
    "fragmentation functions represent the probability for a parton to fragment into a particular hadron carrying a certain fraction of the parton s energy and , like structure functions , can not be calculated in perturbative qcd , but can be evolved from a starting distribution at a defined energy scale . if the fragmentation functions are combined with the cross sections for the inclusive production of each parton type in the given physical process , predictions can be made for the scaled momentum , @xmath49 spectra of final state hadrons .",
    "small @xmath50 fragmentation is significantly affected by the coherence ( destructive interference ) of soft gluons  @xcite , whilst scaling violation of the fragmentation function at large @xmath50 allows a measurement of @xmath36  @xcite .    a natural frame in which to study the dynamics of the hadronic final state in dis",
    "is the breit frame  @xcite . in this frame",
    "the exchanged virtual boson is purely space - like with 3-momentum @xmath51 , the incident quark carries momentum @xmath52 in the positive @xmath53 direction , and the outgoing struck quark carries q/2 in the negative @xmath53 direction .",
    "a final state particle has a 4-momentum @xmath54 in this frame , and is assigned to the current region if @xmath55 is negative , and to the target frame if @xmath55 is positive .",
    "the advantage of this frame lies in the maximal separation of the outgoing parton from radiation associated with the incoming parton and the proton remnant , thus providing the optimal environment for the study of the fragmentation of the outgoing parton .    in  annihilation",
    "the two quarks are produced with equal and opposite momenta , @xmath56 this can be compared with a quark struck from within the proton with outgoing momentum @xmath57 in the breit frame . in the direction of the struck quark ( the current fragmentation region ) the particle momentum spectra ,",

    "this value is consistent with that published by opal , @xmath69 , where the peak position was extracted using an alternative method  @xcite .",
    "a consistent value of the gradient is therefore determined in dis and  annihilation experiments .",
    "also shown is the statistical fit to the data when @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) which would be the case if the qcd cascade was of an incoherent nature , dominated by cylindrical phase space .",

    "[ fig : largexp ] .",
    "the increasingly steep fall - off , at fixed @xmath73 towards higher values of @xmath50 as @xmath6 increases , shown in figure  [ fig : largexp ] , corresponds to the production of more particles with a smaller fractional momentum , and is indicative of scaling violation in the fragmentation function . for @xmath74",

    "this review gives a brief summary of a small sample of the qcd results coming from hera .",
    "charged particle distributions have been studied in the current region of the breit frame over a wide range of @xmath22 these result show clear evidence for scaling violation in scaled momenta as a function of @xmath6 and supports the coherent nature of qcd cascades .",

    "the intriguing rise of @xmath25 at small @xmath5 can be well described using conventional dglap evolution equations .",
    "the data though can also be described by the bfkl approach thus giving rise to ambiguities how to treat qcd in this small @xmath5 regime . in order to resolve these ambiguities jet production in the forward direction has been studied and the cross section for such jets is seen not to be reproduced by monte carlo models based on dglap parton shower evolution .",
