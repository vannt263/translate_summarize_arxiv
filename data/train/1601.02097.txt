    "the system possessing a chaotic dynamics one can aver existence of the markov partitioning of the surface , meaning that each next symbol in the symbolic dynamics is defined only by the previous one . for infinite or cyclic sequences the real trajectory can be uniquely restored from the symbolic dynamics .",
    "often , the obtained markov alphabet includes an infinite number of symbols , as , for instance , in chaotic billiards , out of the flow discontinuity on the billiard walls .",
    "it is not forbidden , however , to define some other partition prompted by physical ( geometrical ) properties of the system , which would generate a finite alphabet .",
    "the fee for such convenience is formation of constraints on combinations of more then two subsequent symbols in the symbolic dynamics . in this article",
    "we consider a special case of symbolic dynamics generated by baker s map  @xcite .",
    "it is a chaotic map from the unit square into itself , its symbolic dynamics do not assume any constraints , i.e. all possible symbolic sequences correspond to some trajectory generated by the baker s map .",

    "the time - order switching happens in the regions called encounters , where each of the orbits comes onto the shortest distance to itself , being , at the same time , mostly distanced from the partner .",

    "the closeness of the partner orbits is reflected in the fact that the corresponding symbolic sequences being globally different are locally identical , i.e. they both consist of the same set of sub - strings of some given length @xmath2 ( fig .",

    "there is a number of principal questions arising in the field , which has been reported in the literature : how the number of possible realizations of sequences behaves with the length of the sequences segments , @xmath2 , and the related question what is the optimal length of the reads  @xcite ?",
    "the computational bottleneck in realization of de novo algorithms is the amount of memory required for saving the de bruijn sub - graph data , which , obviously , becomes central for assembling of large genomes  @xcite .    generally speaking , both the study of topological structures of periodic orbits in dynamical systems and the problem of dna sequence assembly are based on the same mathematical apparatus .",
    "our recent finding of the ultrametric structure of the set of symbolic sequences  @xcite allows to extend our understanding of the problems and develop novel analytic and algorithmic approaches .",
    "some of these ideas we demonstrate in the present article .",
    "moreover , we believe that the introduced below operator language and wavelet analysis on cyclic symbolic sequences will be useful as well for formulation of advanced theoretical approaches in theories describing multi - scale stochastic processes on the set of symbolic sequences ( see for instance  @xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the operator formalism for the work with symbolic sequences in their frequency representation and reproduce the main known facts about the ultrametric structure of sequences ( section 2.2 ) , their geometric representation by means of de bruijn graphs , as well as formula for the number of de bruijn sequences obtained by counting euler and hamiltonian cycles on the de bruijn graphs ( section 2.3 ) . here",

    "the main analytic structures discussed in the present research are rising ( section 2.2 ) and lowering ( section 3.1 ) operators on the cluster tree .",
    "analysis of them in basis of wavelets , constructed by analogy with @xmath2-adic wavelets  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , allows to define rigorous procedure for reconstruction of sequences belonging to certain clusters ( see example on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . according to the procedure , on each hierarchical level one reduces the problem to the solution of a number of independent linear systems of diophantine equations ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the main advantage of the approach is that after a certain hierarchy level @xmath2 , such that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the number of letters in alphabet , @xmath5 is the length of the sequence ) there is only a finite number of relevant solutions and this number decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "as we show in section 3.3 , the `` center of masses '' of our approach lies in analysis of connectivity of the obtained sequences .",

    "the raising operator acting on such frequency vectors can be seen as a gluing operator acting on several sequences .",
    "in such a way one can organize a stochastic process on a set of symbolic sequences .",
    "the process can be described as follows , after several subsequent rising of a starting long sequence and the same number of lowerings of the obtained frequency vector with a random choice of possible solutions one can get a solution which instead of one cyclic sequence contains many of them of a shorter lengths .",
    "this procedure of rising and lowering repeated several times can be considered as a stochastic process of `` random bubbling of symbolic sequences '' .    to summarize , we can say that , generically , the idea of classification of sequences with respect to the local content is rather natural .",
    "first step in this direction was done in the work of hamming  @xcite , who introduced a _",
    "metric _ distance between sequences .",
    "the hamming distance between two given sequences , such that both have the same length and a fixed starting point , is defined as the total number of different symbols appearing in the identical positions .",
    "the metric space generated by the hamming distance on the set of binary sequences is known as hamming cube .",
    "the hamming distance , however does not take into account the surrounding symbols . on the contrary ,",
    "the ultrametric distance is absolutely insensitive to the absolute position of symbols within the sequence , while it takes into account the local surrounding .",
    "thus even one different symbol in two sequences put them on the furthest distance from each other .",
    "this prompts us the next natural step in the direction of classification of symbolic sequences .",
    "this should be combination of both approaches together .",
    "note that first attempts of such kind are based not on the construction of distances , but on introduction of stochastic processes which take into account both positions of symbols and their local surrounding see the work  @xcite and also works  @xcite .",

    "on the fig .  [ fig10 ] we graphically represent structure of the factor set @xmath389 by a special choice of its representatives from the set @xmath390 . one can compare it with the structure of the same set ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) revealed by the ultrametric distance  ( [ ultrdist ] ) .",
    "the representatives of @xmath389 are chosen to maximize the number @xmath391 , i.e. the index of the basis vector  ( [ trivultrametricity ] ) .",
    "for the case of prime @xmath5 one can offer a synthetic algorithm based on the following principles :    * sequences are classified by @xmath392 , the lengths of the longest sub - string , @xmath393 $ ] , and by the frequency @xmath166 of appearance @xmath394 in the sequence . the integer partition of @xmath5 , then has the form @xmath395 let @xmath396 be the sequence @xmath394 followed by arbitrary string of the length @xmath397 , as on the scheme @xmath398 * since @xmath5 is prime , there are at least two non - equal @xmath399 entering the integer partition of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath400 , then there is at least one @xmath401 , such that @xmath402 is not divisible by @xmath403 .",
    "therefore one can organize a set of cyclic sequences constructed from two letters @xmath404 and @xmath405 , such that they have no other periods except @xmath406 , for instance @xmath407 * to obtain the representatives one should choose any suitable strategy of ordering of @xmath402 pieces between @xmath403 places , such that the resulting sequences of @xmath404 s and @xmath405 s can not be obtained one from the other by any rotation and , finally , one has to and fill up the yet empty places within the strings @xmath396 by all possible ways .     by a binary tree . only half of the tree ( the sequences starting from @xmath138 ) is plotted .",
