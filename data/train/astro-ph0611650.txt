    "the issue of bulge formation and evolution has lately received renewed attention due to recent studies which form the basis for a growing consensus that the bulge is old and that its formation timescale was relatively short ( @xmath0 gyr ) .",
    "we want to test the hypothesis of a quick dissipational collapse via the study of the evolution of the abundance ratios coupled with considerations on the metallicity distribution and to show that abundance ratios can provide an independent constraint for the bulge formation scenario since they differ depending on the star formation history ( matteucci , 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath1-elements in particular are of paramount importance in probing the star formation timescale , since the signature of a very short burst of star formation must result into an enhancement with respect to iron .",
    "the model we are adopting is described by ballero et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and belongs to the category of fast dissipational collapse prior to the settling of the disk .",
    "it follows the trend of previous models by matteucci & brocato ( 1990 ) and matteucci et al .",
    "the star formation rate is proportional to the gas surface mass density of the disk : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the star formation efficiency , i.e. the inverse of the star formation timescale .",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is parametrized as a power - law of logarithmic index @xmath4 : @xmath5 which may differ among the various mass ranges . finally , the bulge forms via infall of gas shed from the galactic halo on a timescale @xmath6 : @xmath7 we updated the stellar lifetimes by adopting those of kodama ( 1997 ) and we introduced the stellar yields by franois et al .",

    "et al . ( 2000 ) the imf index below @xmath8 was set @xmath9 .",
    "the type ia supernova rate is computed following the single - degenerate scenario , according to matteucci & recchi ( 2001 ) .",
    "finally , a primary production of nitrogen from massive stars , as computed by matteucci ( 1986 ) is considered as opposed to purely secondary production , which is usually adopted in chemical evolution model .",
    "we also introduced a supernova - driven wind in analogy with elliptical galaxies . to develop it",
    ", we supposed that the bulge lies at the bottom of the potential well of the galactic halo , whose mass is @xmath10 and whose effective radius is @xmath11 times the effective radius of the bulge mass distribution .",
    "the binding energy of the bulge is then calculated following bertin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who split the potential energy into two parts , one due to the bulge potential to bulge gas interaction and the other due to the interaction of the bulge gas with the potential well of the dark matter halo of the milky way , which depends on the relative mass distribution .",
    "the thermal energy of the interstellar medium due to supernova explosions is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rate of type ia and type ii supernovae , @xmath14 is the explosion time and @xmath15 is the energy content of a supernova remnant , whose evolution is calculated following cox ( 1972 ) and cioffi & shull ( 1988 ) . when @xmath16 a wind develops which devoids the bulge of all its gas , and the evolution is passive thereafter .     for @xmath17 , @xmath18 gyr@xmath19 , @xmath20 gyr )",

    "if the average trend of these observations is representative of the pristine [ n / o ] values , the fit is achieved with the latter model .",

    "we investigated variations of the parameters which influence the chemical evolution , namely of the imf index ( from 0.33 to the scalo ( 1998 ) value ) of the star formation efficiency @xmath3 ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 gyr@xmath19 ) and of the infall timescale @xmath6 ( from @xmath23 to @xmath24 gyr ) and matched the results with the most recent data for the metallicity distribution and the evolution of [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios with metallicity ( see fig .",

    "we found out that in order to reproduce all the constraints it is necessary to adopt a short formation timescale ( @xmath25 gyr ) and an intense efficiency of star formation ( @xmath26 gyr ) , combined with an imf flatter ( @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) than that suitable for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the reference model we plotted is also able to explain the different trends of [ o / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] as seen from the observations .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) the [ n / o ] vs. [ o / h ] plot with the data from planetary nebulae of grny et al . ( 2004 ) , we see that in order to reproduce the average trend of observations it is necessary to assume a primary production of nitrogen from massive stars of all masses at every metallicity , in analogy with the solar neighbourhood ( ballero et al , 2006a ) .",
