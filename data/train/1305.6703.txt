    "over the last few decades , quantum spin ladders have been actively studied mainly in connection with spin - liquid behaviour , quantum critical points and superconductivity under hole doping of some cuprates ( see ref . [ ] for a review ) . in particular , the frustrated spin-1/2 heisenberg two - leg ladder exhibits a striking dimerized ground state [ ] and a low - temperature magnetization process with an intermediate plateau and magnetization jumps [ ] .",
    "another challenging topic of current research interest consists of the theoretical investigation of related models such as the quantum spin-1 heisenberg two - leg ladder [ ] .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to find the exact ground states of a simpler spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder and to contrast them with the respective ground states of the pure quantum spin-1 heisenberg ladder .",
    "note that the former model is analytically tractable using the procedure developed in refs .",
    "[ ] and it brings insight into the relevant behaviour of the latter not fully integrable model .",
    "consider first the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder with the heisenberg intra - rung interaction and the unique ising interaction along the legs and diagonals .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the investigated model is given by @xmath0 , \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes spatial components of the spin-1 operator , the former suffix @xmath2 = 1 or 2 enumerates the leg and the latter suffix specifies a lattice position within a given leg .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath3 denotes the isotropic heisenberg intra - rung interaction , the parameter @xmath4 determines the ising interaction along the legs and diagonals , @xmath5 is an external magnetic field .    for further convenience ,",
    "let us introduce the spin operator @xmath6 , which corresponds to the total spin angular momentum of the @xmath7th rung .",
    "it can be easily proved that the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 commute with the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , i.e. @xmath10 = [ \\hat{\\cal h } , \\hat{\\textbf{t}}_{i}^z ] = 0 $ ] , which means that the total spin of a rung and its @xmath11 component represent conserved quantities with well defined quantum numbers .",
    "the complete energy spectrum of the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder then readily follows from the relation @xmath12 which depends just on the quantum numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 determining the eigenvalues of the total spin of the @xmath7th rung and its @xmath11th spatial projection , respectively . using this procedure",
    ", the spin-1 ising - heisenberg two - leg ladder has been rigorously mapped to some classical chain of composite spins and accordingly , we can readily find all available ground states by looking for the lowest - energy state of eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) .",
    "next , we will also consider the frustrated spin-1 heisenberg two - leg ladder defined by the hamiltonian @xmath15 , \\label{hamh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents the pure quantum analogue of the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder discussed previously . taking advantage of the definition for the total spin of each rung ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamh ] ) of frustrated spin-1 heisenberg two - leg ladder can be rewritten into the form @xmath16 according to eq .",
    "( [ diagh ] ) , the frustrated spin-1 heisenberg ladder can be rigorously decomposed into the direct sum of quantum spin chains with spin 0 , 1 or 2 at each site .",
    "the ground state of such a system can be shown to be either a homogeneous chain , with the same spin at all sites , or a chain with alternating spins on every other site . comparing the energy of the different chains , obtained either analytically or using dmrg simulations , the exact ground - state phase diagram of the frustrated spin-1 heisenberg ladder can be constructed [ ] .",
    "the constructed ground - state phase diagrams of the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg and heisenberg ladders are depicted in fig.[fig1]a and fig.[fig1]b , respectively .",
    "the ground states of the spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder can be discerned according to the @xmath11th projection of the total spin on two consecutive rungs @xmath17 $ ] , because @xmath18 holds for all available ground states .",
    "the quantum ground states [ 0,0 ] , [ 0,1 ] , [ 1,1 ] , [ 2 , 1 ] and [ 2,0 ] represent six different phases , whereas @xmath19 implies a formation of two singlets on the @xmath7th rung , @xmath20 entails only one singlet and @xmath21 denotes fully polarized rungs without singlets .",
    "besides , two classical ground states [ 2,2 ] and [ 2,-2 ] are pertinent to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the magnetization normalized with respect to its saturation equals zero for [ 0,0 ] and [ 2,-2 ] , one - quarter for [ 0,1 ] and [ 2,-1 ] , one - half for [ 1,1 ] and [ 2,0 ] , three - quarters for [ 2,1 ] and unity for [ 2,2 ] .",
    "altogether , it can be concluded that the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg ladder always exhibits a stepwise magnetization curve , which involves intermediate plateaux at one - quarter , one - half and three - quarters of the saturation magnetization that are however of different origin .",
    "it is quite clear from fig.[fig1]b that the ground - state phase diagram of the pure quantum heisenberg ladder exactly coincides with that of the ising - heisenberg ladder just for sufficiently weak inter - rung interactions @xmath22 . a relatively good agreement between both phase diagrams",
    "is still observed in the parameter space @xmath23 , where the gapless phase [ 2 ] with a continuously varying magnetization is present between the intermediate plateaux instead of direct magnetization jumps .",
    "the gapless phase [ 2 ] corresponds to the luttinger - liquid phase of the effective spin-2 quantum heisenberg chain .",
    "finally , the gapped haldane phase of the effective spin-2 quantum heisenberg chain emerges for @xmath24 at sufficiently low fields .      in conclusion",
    ", we have rigorously found the ground states of the frustrated spin-1 ising - heisenberg and heisenberg ladders in a magnetic field .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the ising - heisenberg ladder always exhibits a stepwise magnetization curve with three different intermediate plateaus , while the same quantum ground states can be identified in the pure quantum heisenberg ladder provided the intra - rung coupling is sufficiently large",
