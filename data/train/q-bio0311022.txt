    "protein crystals contain between around 30% and 70% of solvent @xcite , most of which is disordered in the solvent channels among the protein molecules of the crystal lattice .",
    "thus the electron densities of the protein molecules , with typical values of 0.43 e / @xmath1 , are surrounded by a continuous disordered solvent electron density ranging between 0.33 e / @xmath1 for pure water and 0.41 e / @xmath1 for 4 m ammonium sulphate @xcite .",
    "if we do not account for any model for this continuous disordered solvent electron density , atomic protein models are thought as if it were placed in vacuum .",
    "the electron density itself is overestimated , the calculated structure factor amplitudes are systematically much larger than the observed ones @xcite , and it is commonly believed that the latter condition especially occurs at low resolution .",
    "the higher is the discrepancy among the calculated structure factors and the observed ones , the more difficult is the data scaling , the least - square refinement and the electron density map rendering .",
    "cutting low resolution data has been a widely adopted method to step over the problem , although it was rough and , somehow , intrinsically wrong : indeed , it introduced distortions of the local electron density ( an optical example is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "a great effort has been recently devoted to devise a reliable method accounting for the disordered solvent effects in the protein region @xcite .",
    "two of them deserve a brief description .    * the exponential scaling model @xcite . +",
    "this model is obtained by the direct application of babinet s principle to the calculated structure factors .",
    "the solvent structure factors moduli are assumed to be proportional to the protein ones , whereas the phases are opposite .",
    "the lower is the resolution the more satisfactory is the agreement between the observed structure factor and the calculated one @xcite . due to its simplicity , this model has been implemented in most of the crystallographic refinement programs @xcite .",
    "the weakness of this model is strictly related to the resolution at which it is expected to work properly .",
    "indeed the approximation embodied in this method is true at resolutions below @xmath2 15   although it can be stretched up to @xmath2 5  by downscaling the structure factors . * the mask model @xcite . + this model is an improvement of the previous one , since it aims to sum up the protein structure factor and the solvent one vectorially ,",
    "_ i.e. _ by accounting for both the modulus and the phase of the two structure factors . in the mask model",
    "the protein molecules are placed on a grid in the unit cell whereas the grid points outside the protein region are filled with the disordered solvent electron density .",
    "the protein boundary is mainly determined by the van  der  waals radii .",
    "the disordered solvent electron density is @xmath3stretched@xmath3 to fill in the empty space and the calculation of the solvent structure factor is straightforward .",
    "although the mask model works rather well , there are three major drawbacks of it : too many parameters have to be fitted and the relatively large @xmath4 ratio weakens the model at high resolution ( overfitting ) ; finally , the disordered solvent electron density is unrealistically assumed to be step shaped and flat .",
    "some strategies have been already devised to improve the latter ones @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to focus on a recently developed statistical method and its application to disentangle the protein and the solvent contributions out of crystallographic data ; we show its major advantages and drawbacks .",
    "up to our knowledge this method has never been applied to this field .",
    "a comparison of the protein fraction in the unit cell , calculated by this method , with the same quantity computed by the most popular method used nowadays @xcite is satisfactory .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : the _ theory _ section provides the reader with the basic concepts of the independent component analysis ; the _ results and discussion _ section applies the theory to the specific case of a 2-dimensional problem ( _ i.e. _ solvent / protein system ) we are interested in ; it concludes with the calculation of the protein fraction for several protein structures and with a comparison of this quantity with the analogous one calculated by the matthews model accounting for the protein content only .",
    "_ conclusions _ section summarizes the paper s content and suggests further investigations .",
    "several techniques have been devised so far to deal with protein crystallography . among them",
    "we quote the isomorphous derivative ( sir , mir ) and the anomalous dispersion ( sad , mad ) ones ( we address the reader to a number of review papers for details on these techniques ; see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the theory described hereafter can be applied to protein crystallography regardless of the specific technique we are using and without any substantial modification ; therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we shall focus on the isomorphous derivative one . anyway",
    "the method will be finally applied to several proteins : among them some are anomalous dispersion structures and some others refer to the isomorphous derivative technique .    a protein and its isomorphous derivatives crystallize in a solvent .",
    "imagine that you are measuring the diffraction intensities out of a crystallized protein sample and one of its isomorphous derivatives .",
    "each of these recorded signals is a weighted sum of the signals emitted by the two main sources ( _ i.e. _ protein / derivative and solvent ) , which we denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , _ i.e. _ the protein / derivative and solvent structure factors , respectively .",
    "we can express each of them as a linear combination @xmath7 actually if we knew the @xmath8 parameters we would solve the problem at a once by classical methods .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case and the problem turns out to be much more difficult .    under the hypothesis of statistical independence of the @xmath9 structure factor phase differences , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 @xcite , we can write @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the resolution shell averaged intensity and the approximation in the last equation written above is justified by the isomorphism among the protein and its derivatives .",
    "@xmath8 are some parameters that depend on the hidden variables of the problem .",
    "of course we are interested in spotting the two original sources @xmath13 and @xmath14 by using only the recorded signals @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    using some information about the statistical properties of the original signals @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a possible approach to estimate the @xmath8 parameters . the _ statistical independence _ of the two sources is not surprising whereas the fact that the above condition is not only necessary but also sufficient is @xcite .",
    "the independent component analysis is a technique recently developed to estimate the @xmath8 parameters based on the information of the statistical independence of the original sources .",
    "it allows to separate the latter ones from their mixtures @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "several applications of ica have been recently devised and , therefore , a unified mathematical framework is required .    to begin with ,",
    "we rigorously define ica @xcite by referring to a statistical @xmath3latent variables@xmath3 model , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 where j runs over the number of linear mixtures we observe and n is the number of hidden sources .    the statistical model defined in eq.([ica - def ] ) is called independent component analysis .",
    "it describes the generation of observed data @xmath18 as a result of an unknown mixture @xmath19 of unknown sources @xmath20 .",
    "finding out both the mixing matrix and the hidden sources is the aim of this method . in order to do so",
    ", ica assumes that    * the components @xmath20 are statistically independent , * the components @xmath20 are random variables and their distribution is gaussian , * the mixing matrix @xmath19 is square , although this hypothesis can be sometimes relaxed . for a detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the mixing matrix @xmath19 has been computed ; the inverse mixing matrix @xmath21 is achievable and the problem is readily solved : @xmath22 for each hidden source .",
    "adding some noise terms in the measurements is certainly a more realistic approach although it turns out to be more tricky : for the time being , we shall skip this aspect in order to focus on a free - noise ica model .",
    "of course extending the conclusions to more complicated models is straightforward .",
    "without loss of generality we shall assume that @xmath18 are standardized random variables , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the latter choice is always possible since both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are known for the starting data samples @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , we can always replace the starting set of random variables @xmath18 with the new one as follows @xmath27 moreover ica aims to disentangle the hidden sources ( @xmath20 ) and , therefore , looking at preprocessing techniques to uncorrelate the _ would - be _ sources before applying any ica algorithm is a major advantage .",
    "therefore this procedure , named data whitening , is certainly a useful preprocessing strategy in ica .",
    "the eigenvalue decomposition ( evd ) is the most popular way to whiten data : the starting set of variables is linearly transformed according to the following rule @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the n - rank covariance matrix for the starting set of statistical variables .",
    "the covariance matrix for the new set of @xmath31 variables is diagonal .",
    "of course the data whitening modifies the mixing matrix @xmath19 ; infact , by applying the ica definition of the eq.([ica - def ] ) to both sets of variables ( @xmath18 and @xmath31 ) in the eq.([whitened - vars ] ) , we get @xmath32 where i runs over 1, ... ,n .",
    "it turns out that data whitening has considerably simplified the initial problem since the new mixing matrix @xmath33 is orthogonal and , therefore , the n@xmath34 components of @xmath19 have been reduced to @xmath35 .    after having standardized and whitened the starting set of statistical variables , we are ready to implement the ica algorithm",
    "actually we are looking for a unique matrix @xmath36 that combines with the @xmath31 variables in order to get the hidden sources @xmath37 satisfying the ica prescriptions . indeed the conditions @xmath38 of ica are readily achieved as soon as we note that the product of the whitened set of standardized random variables @xmath31 by any n - dimensional orthogonal matrix leaves the variables uncorrelated , whitened , standardized and , moreover , it leaves the mixing matrix @xmath33 orthogonal .",
    "therefore we shall limit ourselves to an n - dimensional orthogonal matrix @xmath36 and we shall fix its @xmath35 degrees of freedom by assuming the nongaussianity of the probability distribution functions of the hidden sources @xmath39 .",
    "there are several measures of nongaussianity and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper ( for more details see @xcite ) ; instead we briefly introduce the measure of nongaussianity we shall adopt : the negentropy .",
    "entropy is a fundamental concept of information theory .",
    "the entropy of a random variable is its coding length ( for details see @xcite ) . for a discrete random variable",
    ", entropy is defined as follows @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the possible values of @xmath42 .",
    "one of the main result of the information theory is that a gaussian variable has the largest entropy among the random variables with the same @xmath25 .",
    "therefore we argue that the less structured is a random variable the more gaussian is its distribution . in order to get",
    "a nonnegative measure of a random variable nongaussianity , whose value is zero for a gaussian variable , it is worth to introduce the following quantity @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the entropy of a gaussian random variable .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to the eq.([negentropy ] ) as to the negentropy of a random variable @xmath42 .",
    "the negentropy of a random variable , as defined in the eq.([negentropy ] ) , is well defined by the statistical theory and , moreover , it can be easily generalized to a system of random variables : infact the additivity of the entropy is immediately extended to the negentropy .",
    "moreover negentropy is invariant under an invertible linear transformation @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of the negentropy , as defined in the eq.([negentropy ] ) , is the computation itself since the precise evaluation of it requires the nonparametric estimation of the probability distribution function for the random variable we are dealing with .",
    "several simplifications of negentropy have been devised and we shall focus on two of them .    *",
    "the kurtosis @xcite .",
    "+ the kurtosis is the 4@xmath45 order momentum of a random variable probability distribution function , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 , where @xmath42 is a random variable . for a gaussian random variable kurtosis equals 0 .",
    "the negentropy of eq.([negentropy ] ) is readily simplified : @xmath47 .",
    "+ the major drawback of the kurtosis approximation of negentropy is the lack of robustness , since its computation out of a data sample can be very sensitive to the outliers @xcite . *",
    "maximum entropy @xcite .",
    "+ in order to step over the unrobustness of the negentropy approximation described above , it is useful to introduce a conceptually simple and fast to be computed approximation of the negentropy based on maximum entropy principle .",
    "we write the negentropy according to the following formula @xmath48 ^ 2 \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath49 are suitable coefficients , @xmath50 are nonquadratic functions , @xmath42 is a unit variance random variable and @xmath51 is a unit variance gaussian random variable .",
    "the approximation of eq.([negentropy - approx ] ) generalizes the kurtosis one ; infact for a single function @xmath50 ( _ i.e. _ n=1 ) the choice @xmath52 exactly leads to the kurtosis approximation described above .",
    "the slower is the growing of the @xmath50 functions the more robust is the approximation of the negentropy .",
    "both of the approximations described above satisfy the main features of the negentropy , _",
    "i.e. _ the nonnegativity , the zero value for a gaussian random variable and the additivity .    before showing the details of the ica application to the protein crystallography , we spot some intrinsic ambiguities of the ica procedure @xcite .    *",
    "the @xmath25 of the independent components can not be determined since the hidden sources and the mixing matrix are unknown and they can be simultanously scaled by the same quantity without modifying any conclusion . the choice @xmath53 leaves the ambiguity of the sign .",
    "* the order of the independent components can not be determined .",
    "indeed any permutation of the hidden sources leads to a similarity transformation on the mixing matrix and since both of them are unknown the permutation does not affect the algorithm itself .",
    "the ambiguities described above can be solved by means of physical contraints featuring the ica solutions of the specific problem .",
    "we will discuss how to overcome this problem in the next section .",
    "we have focused on the 2-dimensional problem described in the introduction and briefly formalized at the beginning of the theory section .    after having recalled the definitions of the eq.([lin - comb ] ) , we proceed with the standardizing and the withening procedures of the starting set of random variables @xmath54^{p",
    "/ d+s } \\;\\ ; , \\label{std - whitening}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the whitening matrix defined by the eigenvalue decomposition ( evd ) of the @xmath56 @xmath57 matrix . at this stage",
    "we apply the ica algorithm to @xmath58 . in two dimensions",
    "an orthogonal matrix is determined by a single angle parameter ; we get @xmath59 where the last formula of the eq.([ica - matrix ] ) defines the @xmath60-dependent solutions of ica , _",
    "i.e. _ the standardized , whitened random variables depending on the single parameter @xmath60 that has to be fixed by maximizing the total negentropy @xmath61 as follows @xmath62 where we use a single function @xmath50 ( _ i.e. _ n=1 in the eq.([negentropy - approx ] ) ) and , according to @xcite , we adopt @xmath63 . in the eq.([max - negentropy ] ) the negentropy additivity has been applied .",
    "other choices for @xmath64 are possible @xcite and we have checked that neither the solutions nor the algorithm are sensitive to them .",
    "we denote with @xmath65 the angle @xmath60 where the total negentropy @xmath61 attains its maximum . therefore we can conclude @xmath66 in that respect @xmath67 are the standardized , whitened and maximally nongaussian random variables corresponding to the hidden sources of the initial problem .    as to the ambiguities of this technique , mentioned at the end of the previous section , we solve the first one by taking the absolute value of @xmath67 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ we introduce the quantities @xmath68 .    at this stage",
    "we define the protein / solvent fraction as follows @xmath69 } \\;\\ ; , \\label{prot - frac}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 runs over the number of resolution shells according to eq .",
    "( [ lin - comb ] ) and @xmath71 , being @xmath72 the shell averaged resolution .    the protein fraction definition of eq.([prot - frac ] )",
    "is justified by the kinematic theory @xcite stating that the diffraction intensity is expected to depend on the crystal volume @xmath73 and on the unit cell volume v according to the @xmath74 ratio .    according to @xcite",
    "the relevant information of the protein structures is contained in three resolution ranges , @xmath75 , @xmath76   and @xmath77 .",
    "the first range information is dominated by the protein structure at atomic level while in the third one the solvent content is overwhelming ( the density modification procedures aim to re - scale the structure factors moduli in the low resolution range to account for the bulk disordered solvent ) .",
    "the scattering powers of protein and solvent are of the same order in the @xmath76   range @xcite . hence the expression ( [ prot - frac ] )",
    "is evaluated in this range .",
    "the comparison between the protein fraction value obtained by ica with the one by matthews method @xcite , computed as in @xcite , finds out the correct order of the independent components @xmath78 .",
    "the results of this comparison are shown in table [ tab : fp ] for several proteins .",
    "the agreement between the protein fractions obtained by the two methods is quite satisfactory .",
    "the proteins reported in table [ tab : fp ] are named according to their codes . for each of them",
    "we have the crystallographic data of the native and of one derivative for the isomorphous derivative technique . for the anomalous dispersion technique",
    ", we use the crystallographic data of the native collected at one wavelength .    on the last row in the table [ tab : fp ] the errors are the protein fraction @xmath79 for the two different methods .",
    "the average values as well as the @xmath79 are comparable .    in fig.[fig :",
    "crys - vol1 ] we report the protein fraction distribution for the proteic structures listed in table [ tab : fp ] and computed by ica . figure [ fig : crys - vol2 ] shows the corresponding distribution of the crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight calculated according to the formula in ref.@xcite ( for a full comparison see fig.2 in the reference @xcite ) .",
    "according to our analysis the most probable value for the crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight falls into the range 1.85 - 2.25 @xmath1/dalton .",
    "in this paper we have applied a new technique , the independent component analysis , to calculate the protein fraction out of crystallographic data . the analysis here presented aims to disentangle the protein and the disordered solvent contributions . provided a sufficient number of crystallographic data ( at least as many as the supposed hidden sources ) ,",
