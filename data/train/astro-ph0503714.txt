    "the search for ` anomalous microwave emission ' or ` dust - correlated microwave emission ' was started by the surprising statistical correlation of _ cobe _ dmr observations at centimetric wavelengths with dirbe dust emission at 140   @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar correlation with the ovro ring observations at 14.5 and 32 ghz .",
    "ordinary thermal emission from dust at these relatively low frequencies is expected to be orders of magnitude lower than the intrinsic cmb fluctuations .",
    "it was initially suggested that this anomalous emission had its origin with free - free processes associated with the warm ionized interstellar medium .",
    "the lack of the expected h@xmath4 from this ionized gas would require temperatures hotter than @xmath5k .",
    "however @xcite argued against such high temperature on energetic grounds and proposed an alternative mechanism based on electric dipole emission from small dust grains .",
    "further evidence for anomalous microwave emission has been found in data from other cmb experiments such as saskatoon @xcite , 19ghz @xcite , tenerife @xcite , python v @xcite , _ wmap _ @xcite and the green bank galactic plane survey ( gbgps ) @xcite .    despite this growing evidence ,",
    "the exact nature and distribution of this new foreground remains elusive and part of this is because there is no comparable survey below 20 ghz to complement the _ wmap _ data .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that _ wmap _ foregrounds can be fitted by a proposed flatter component of synchrotron . @xcite and @xcite point out that tenerife and gbgps data provides evidence for rising spectrum at 10 and 15 ghz which is incompatible with synchrotron emission .",
    "a similar survey to the tenerife experiment @xcite in frequency and sky coverage but with degree scale resolution is now available with the cosmosomas experiment @xcite of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) .",
    "the cosmosomas experiment consists of two circular scanning instruments operating at the teide observatory ( altitude 2400 m , tenerife ) .",
    "they have produced 0.8 - 1.1   resolution maps of @xmath6 10000 square degrees in the sky in four frequency bands ( centered at 10.9 , 12.7 , 14.7 , 16.3 ghz ) .",
    "the average sensitivity of each map is in the range @xmath7k per beam .",
    "the basic observing strategy is described in @xcite .",
    "details of the survey by the two instruments where a significant dust correlation is found at @xmath8 is given in @xcite .",
    "in this letter we present results of a search for sites of dust - correlated emission with a rising flux density spectrum in the first release of the cosmosomas maps .",
    "since we are focusing on bright discrete sources we chose to generate a list of possible sources with sextractor @xcite using a detection threshold of 4 sigma on the more sensitive 13 ghz cosmosomas map ( @xmath9dec@xmath10 ) . since in the auriga - perseus galactic crossing the confusion is lower and the sources are more clearly separated , we have centered our search for sources of rising spectrum in this region which is shown in fig  1 .",
    "a few of the objects turned out to be artifacts on close inspection and fluxes were computed for all remaining true sources in each of the cosmosomas frequency bands using a 3 by 3 pixel box ( 1ra by 1dec ) .",
    "one source ( ra = @xmath11 dec = @xmath12 j2000 ) stood out with a clear steep rising spectrum between 11 and 17 ghz with an index of @xmath13 ( s@xmath14 ) .",
    "this source lies in the perseus ob2 area at an intermediate latitude b=-18@xmath15 and is also seen as a bright source in the 100   dirbe map which appears to correspond to the extended _ iras _ source g159.6 - 18.5 .",
    "it also appears to be extended in the cosmosomas maps with a fwhm @xmath16 .",
    "the average temperatures of this pixel box are shown in table  1 showing the almost constant thermal spectrum over the cosmosomas frequencies .    to make a comparison , the _ wmap _ data @xcite have been degraded to the common cosmosomas resolution ( set at 1.12  ) , convolved with the simulated circular lock - in analysis and pixelated in a regular 1/3   cartesian grid in ra and dec .",
    "the lockin analysis includes the removal of the first 7 harmonics to suppress the 1/f noise from receiver and atmosphere .",
    "the effect on the wmap maps is shown by comparing the original map fig.1(a ) and the convolved map fig.1(b ) , where the loss of broad angular features is evident with the creation of negative lobes north and south of bright objects in the center of the map .",
    "this figure also gives a visual example of this dust correlation through the strikingly similar _ wmap _ k ( 22 ghz ) ( fig.1a ) and dirbe 100(fig.1c ) maps in the galactic auriga - perseus region .",
    "two of the detected sources in this area are bright diffuse hii regions , ngc 1499 and ic410 that we use as a calibration check . using 1420 mhz @xcite and the five _ wmap _ template maps we verified that the emission from these objects has a spectral index of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "these indices are consistent with that expected for free - free emission of -0.12 between 11 and 17 ghz . for both sources we find the measured cosmosomas fluxes are generally lower by @xmath6 6% than the predicted values from the fits .",
    "this is consistent with the absolute calibration error of the cosmosomas maps with is better than 10% in the auriga - perseus region .    in order to get the dust correlated emissivity ( @xmath19k [ mjy]@xmath20 sr ) for g159.6 - 18.5 and to quantify the anomalous microwave emission we have carried out a correlation with the 100   dirbe map fig.1(c ) passed through the cosmosomas scanning .",
    "we chose a 11 by 11 pixel box , an area of @xmath21 , centered on the pixel nearest to the center of this source .",
    "this covers the bulk of the emission allowing a good range of pixel values without including much background .",
    "the correlation is calculated by the linear fit of temperature ( @xmath19k ) of the cosmosomas and _ wmap _ pixels to the intensity ( mjy / sr ) of the dirbe pixels using a standard least squares method .",
    "table  1 gives the values for the slopes and errors showing a tight correlation with dirbe .",
    "the equivalent analysis with the 408 and 1420 mhz templates suggests free - free emission is present but with less significance since this emission appears more compact and displaced with respect to the dirbe emission .",
    "g159.6 - 18.5 lies within the perseus molecular cloud complex at a distance of 260 pc @xcite .",
    "it appears in _ iras _ maps as a slightly broken ring with a diameter of @xmath22 composed of several diffuse knots around the rim and a couple in the center , all with intensities of 100 - 200 mjy / sr at 100 .",
    "these knots are still bright at 12   with intensities of 5 - 10 mjy / sr suggesting the presence of transiently heated small dust grains .    at first",
    "it was thought to be a supernova remnant ( snr ) by @xcite , but it was later argued to be a hii region driven by the o9.5-b0 v star hd 278942 @xcite found to be at the center of the ring .",
    "@xcite have made an extensive overview of the nature of this dust ring including interferometric observations at 408 and 1420 mhz and conclude the ring is a ruptured blister hii region which has emerged from the outer edge of the cloud .",
    "their flux density estimates are @xmath23 jy and @xmath24 jy allowing for incomplete sampling of the @xmath25 plane .",
    "this gives a spectral index of @xmath26 , which is consistent with an optically thin hii region ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "they also found many radio sources , but all are steep spectrum apart from the flat spectrum quasar 4c+32.14 , which appears at the nw edge of the ring .",
    "this was removed from all the maps under consideration here assuming a flux of 2 jy at all frequencies .",

    "is lost due to the cosmosomas lock - in analysis we are forced to fit the data to a convolution of a sky density flux model .",
    "we adopted a simple elliptical gaussian for g159.6 - 18.5 based on a fit to the original _ wmap _ ka map .",
    "we obtained a fwhm ellipse for the unconvolved model of @xmath28 pa = 51 .",
    "the expected beam spread function for cosmosomas was then fitted to all the template maps using a least squares method allowing for a zero level offset . for these fits we obtained the amplitudes and subsequently the fluxes , which are listed in table  1 and plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the two low frequency surveys do not show the extended emission , but unresolved emission from the center of the ring so we used the sky model corresponding to a point source .",
    "the error in the estimate of the fwhm of the sky model of 0.1   leads to an overall absolute calibration error of 10% although the relative calibration between frequencies is better than 2% .",
    "the main galactic microwave emission mechanisms are synchrotron , free - free and thermal dust emission .",
    "synchrotron can be estimated from the low frequency surveys , free - free from h@xmath4 emission and thermal dust from dirbe .",
    "the values from the 408 and 1420 mhz surveys for g159.6 - 18.5 suggest no significant synchrotron emission and some free - free emission at the these frequencies , consistent with the flux density measurements made by @xcite inside the ring . a `` bean '' shaped patch of h@xmath4 emission inside the dust ring is detected in this region by the wisconsin h alpha mapper project ( wham ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests the h@xmath4 emission is due to diffuse hii and is shining through a thinner or ruptured part of the dust shell . estimating free - free emission from the h@xmath4 emission is difficult due to the high extinction which also varys strongly across the ring and the unknown fraction of dust in front of the hii region , but we only require a rough indication of the level of emission .",
    "we adapted the method that @xcite describe to estimate galactic free - free emission from h@xmath29 . assuming an extinction factor @xmath30 as expected for molecular clouds we use an expression for h@xmath4 extinction a(h@xmath4 ) = 3.33 e(b - v ) together with the e(b - v ) maps of @xcite and find a mean corrected h@xmath4 intensity over the ring of 120 rayleighs . at 22 ghz ,",
    "close to the peak source emission , the free - free brightness temperature to h@xmath4 intensity ratio ( @xmath31 ) , assuming electron temperature 8000 k , is @xmath32rayleighs . integrating over the area of the ring this corresponds to a flux density of 4.5 jy , similar to the 5.6 jy estimated by extrapolating from the 1420 mhz flux density derived from the reich and reich map .",
    "this is nearly an order of magnitude below the estimated flux density of 42 jy from the _ wmap _ k data .",
    "thermal dust emission can be fitted to the dirbe and _ wmap _ w points as shown in fig.2 , with a dust temperature of 19 k with opacity at 100(@xmath33 ) of @xmath34 and emissivity index 1.55 .",
    "this is what is expected for dust in a `` warm neutral medium '' ( wnm ) .",
    "this wnm region might be generated by interaction with the nearby b0 star .",
    "a very cold dust grain model as tried by @xcite with cbi observations of anomalous microwave emission from the helix nebula would not be consistent with cosmosomas and _ wmap _ points .",
    "there are two known types of object which show a convex spectrum at microwave frequencies ; ultracompact hii regions ( uchii ) and gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources which we assess as possible sources to provide the excess flux density at 22 ghz .",
    "uchii regions produce free - free emission which is self - absorbed at low frequencies due to extremely high densities and the high dust opacity can hide the h@xmath4 emission .",
    "indeed @xcite suggested that an uchii could explain the microwave emission detected by @xcite in the diffuse hii region lph 201.663 + 1.643 , but it did not seem to have the necessary fir luminosity and so anomalous emission was not ruled out . in the case of the perseus cloud its distance is known and uchii regions being amongst the brightest objects at 100   would have a flux density in excess of 1 mjy .",
    "none of the _ iras _ point sources within 1of the cosmosomas source center have _ iras _ colors which meet @xcite criterion for uchii regions and are all less than a few hundred janskys",
    ". such a source could be behind the cloud at a distance of @xmath35 kpc , but at galactic latitude -18this seems very unlikely .",
    "gps sources are high red - shift radio sources in which the radio jets have been highly confined and the synchrotron emission is self - absorbed .",
    "the majority of gps sources have a peak around 1 ghz , but there are a few rare ones such as 1459.9 + 3337 @xcite which peak at 30 ghz .",
    "a gps source having an index of + 1.4 on the low frequency side as suggested by cosmosomas data would have a flux density at 4.85 ghz of @xmath6 5 jy .",
    "a search in the green bank survey ( gb6 ) @xcite within 1.5of the cosmosomas source center finds the brightest source , apart from 4c+34.14 , j0340 + 3209 which is 0.47away with a flux density of 482 mjy . a cross check in the nvss catalogue @xcite over the same area finds this source again as the brightest with a flux density of 1.6 jy showing it to be a steep source with no significant emission at the cosmosomas frequencies .",
    "the extended nature of the cosmosomas source argues against a radio point source and hence against either of these objects .",
    "@xcite have made detailed calculations for the expected spectrum from electric dipole emission of very small spinning dust grains and magnetic dipole radiation from hot ferromagnetic grains .",
    "it is still uncertain the exact mass and dipole moment distribution these grains will have .    as a test of the spinning dust hypothesis we can check if it can produce the measured spectrum with respect to the thermal dust emission .",
    "draine and lazarian s predictions are made in terms of emission in intensity per hydrogen column density in units of jy / sr @xmath36/h .",
    "we estimate a column number density of hydrogen atoms n(h ) = @xmath37 using the canonical factor of @xmath38 h @xmath39 = unit @xmath33 as in @xcite .",
    "there is not enough information to make a detailed model of emission taking into account the varying conditions throughout the cloud , so we use an integrated sum of the wnm model a of drain and lazarian for the dense region facing the b0 star with a contribution of the `` molecular cloud '' ( mc ) model for dust warmed further in the cloud .",
    "assuming the solid angle of the emission is that of the sky model used in section 2 ( @xmath28 ) we find a qualitatively good agreement with the observations using 0.8 wnm and 0.3 mc of the predicted curves ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "although we have not attempted it , there maybe magnetic dipole emission models which can fit the data also .",
    "this anomalous signal in this cloud is so evident because the competing free - free emission is low .",
    "if the free - free emission was five times brighter , for instance if the star was more massive and more embedded , then the detection would be marginal .",
    "yet the stars interaction seems important to excite the thicker parts of the dust shell still embedded in the cloud .",
    "it seems unlikely that objects such as g159.6 - 18.5 could be at high galactic latitudes , but it may prove to be a relatively close example of anomalous emission which can be studied in detail .",
    "the bright fir luminosity and associated microwave continuum emission may mean other such objects exist at low galactic latitudes but have been classified as uchii regions .",
    "our search for rising spectrum sources in the cosmosomas data finds anomalous microwave emission associated with the _ iras _ dust feature g159.6 - 18.5 in the perseus molecular complex .",
    "we measure a rising flux spectrum from 11 to 17 ghz with a spectral index of + 1.4 .",
    "extended frequency coverage using cross calibrated wmap data reveals the expected spectral roll off at both high and low frequencies required for a solid detection of anomalous emission .",
    "the bulk of the emission seems to come from the thicker dusty wall on the molecular cloud side of the ring rather than the center of the ring itself .",
    "we discard an ultracompact hii region or a gigahertz peaked spectrum source as the cause of this microwave emission since they would appear as point sources whereas both cosmosomas and _ wmap _ find an extended diffuse feature . a simple combination spinning dust models can explain the excess microwave emission .",
