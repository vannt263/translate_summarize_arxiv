    "the field of quantum algorithms has witnessed several important results ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the last decade , since the breakthrough discovery of shor s quantum algorithm for factoring and discrete logarithm in 1994 @xcite . despite these important developments ,",
    "two problems in particular had little progress in terms of quantum algorithms : graph isomorphism ( gi ) , and gap versions of lattice problems such as the shortest vector in the lattice problem ( gapsvp ) and the closest vector in the lattice problem ( gapcvp ) .    to understand why these problems are interesting in the context of quantum computation ,",
    "let us first recall their definitions and what is known about them classically .",
    "graph isomorphism is the problem of deciding whether two given graphs can be permuted one to the other .",
    "it is known to be in @xmath6 @xcite and therefore , it is not np complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses .",
    "@xmath7 is the problem of deciding whether the shortest vector in a given @xmath8-dimensional lattice @xmath9 is shorter than @xmath10 or longer than @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the following problem : given a lattice and a vector @xmath13 , decide whether @xmath14 or @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the minimal distance between @xmath13 and any point in @xmath9 .",
    "both problems have important cryptographic applications @xcite .",
    "regarding their complexity , it is easy to see that they both lie in @xmath2 for any @xmath17 .",
    "the results of lagarias et al .",
    "@xcite imply that when @xmath18 , both problems are in @xmath19 . for @xmath20 these lattice problems",
    "are not known to be in @xmath19 but as shown in @xcite , they are in @xmath21 ( and in fact in the class statistical zero knowledge ) .",
    "this implies that for @xmath20 the problems are not np complete unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses .",
    "the fact that the graph isomorphism problem and the two lattice problem with the above parameters are very unlikely to be np complete , and that they possess a lot of structure , raised the hope that quantum computers might be able to solve them more efficiently than classical computers . despite many attempts , so far all that is known in terms of the quantum complexity of these problems are reductions to problems",
    "for which quantum algorithms are also not known @xcite , and negative results regarding possible approaches @xcite .",
    "progress in designing an algorithm for one of these problems is the holy grail of quantum algorithmic theory .    in light of the difficulty of finding efficient algorithms for these problems , a weaker question attracted attention : can any quantum upper bound be given on these problems , which does not follow trivially from the classical upper bounds ? regarding graph isomorphism , which is known to be in coam ,",
    "the natural question to ask is whether it is in coqma , the quantum analog of conp .",
    "it is more natural to speak in this context , and in the rest of the paper , about the _ complements _ of the problems we described , and so the question is whether the graph _ non_-isomorphism ( gni ) problem lies inside qma .",
    "qma can be viewed as the quantum analog of np , and was recently studied in various papers @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , qma is actually the analog of merlin arthur , the probabilistic version of np , since in the quantum world it is more natural to consider probabilistic classes .",
    "attempts to prove that gni is in qma have so far failed . as for lattice problems , since @xmath22 , it follows from the classical result @xcite that if @xmath18 the complements of the problems we described , namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 , lie in @xmath4 .",
    "the interesting question , however , is whether these problems are still in @xmath4 for lower gaps , such as @xmath25 .",
    "notice that this does not follow from the classical results .",
    "in this paper we solve the question of containment in qma for one of the aforementioned problems .",
    "this is the first non trivial quantum upper bound for a lattice problem .",
    "[ thm : main ] the problem @xmath26 is in @xmath4 for some constant @xmath27 .",
    "one of the new ideas in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is the important connection between quantum estimations of inner products , or autocorrelation estimates , and properties of positive definite functions .",
    "the technique of using positive definite functions to analyze quantum protocols is likely to prove useful in other contexts , due to its generality : the property of positive definiteness applies to autocorrelation functions over any group , and not only over @xmath28 as in our case .",
    "another important issue in the proof theorem [ thm : main ] is a problem that arises commonly in the analysis of qma protocols .",
    "namely , in certain situations , we would like to repeat a test on several copies of the witness but the prover might use entanglement between the copies in order to cheat .",
    "we circumvent this problem by giving a new characterization of @xmath4 , named @xmath5 .",
    "we start by proving that indeed @xmath29 and then , using this new characterization , we prove the soundness of our protocol .",
    "hopefully , both the new characterization of qma and the new technique of verification using positive definite functions will help in proving that other important problems such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 lie in @xmath4 .",
    "in more generality , in this work we gain a better understanding of the class qma and the techniques used to analyze it .",
    "we hope that this work will lead to an even better understanding of this important class .",
    "understanding classical np led to a few of the most important results in theoretical computer science , including pcp and hardness of approximation .",
    "a few indications that qma is fundamental for quantum computation have already been given in @xcite .",
    "our results might also lead to progress in terms of quantum algorithms for lattice problems . in this context , it is interesting to consider theorem [ thm : main ] in light of a recent paper by aharonov and ta - shma @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that if the state we use as the quantum witness in the qma protocol can be _ generated _ efficiently , it can be used to provide a @xmath32 algorithm for the lattice problem .",
    "the result we present here shows that certain properties of the state of @xcite can be _ verified _ efficiently , which might be a stepping stone towards understanding how to generate the state efficiently , thus providing an efficient algorithm for the lattice problem .    finally , we mention that similar techniques to the one used in the proof of @xmath29 , might also prove useful in other contexts , for example for proving security of quantum cryptographic protocols .",
    "the paper starts with an overview of the proof .",
    "we continue with preliminaries in section [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is obtained by combining three theorems .",
    "the proof of each of the theorems is independent and is presented in a separate section .",
    "first , in section [ sec : qma+ ] we define the class qma+ and show that it is equal to qma .",
    "then , in section [ sec : cvp ] , we show that @xmath33 , a version of @xmath23 , is in qma+ .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : svptocvp ] we show that if @xmath33 is in qma then so is @xmath24 .",
    "assume we are given a witness which we would like to verify .",
    "usually , we apply a certain unitary transformation and measure the output qubit .",
    "if the witness is correct , the outcome should be @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we reject if the outcome is @xmath34 .",
    "consider , however , a situation where our unitary transformation is such that for the correct witness the outcome is @xmath10 with probability @xmath35 , for some @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the following stronger test : we apply a unitary transformation and accept if the _ probability _ of measuring @xmath10 is close to some number @xmath35 .",
    "we call a verifier that performs such tests a super - verifier and denote the corresponding class by @xmath5",
    ". our first theorem is    [ thm : qma+ ] @xmath29    showing that @xmath4 is contained in @xmath5 is easy ; essentially , the super - verifier can say that the probability of measuring @xmath10 should be close to @xmath37 .",
    "the other direction is more interesting . given a super - verifier we can construct a verifier that accepts a witness which is composed of many copies of the original witness . the verifier can then apply the unitary transformation to each one of the copies and measure the results . finally , it can compute the fraction of times @xmath10 was measured and check if it is close to @xmath35 . indeed , if the prover does not cheat and sends many copies of the original witness we should measure @xmath10 in around a @xmath35 fraction of the measurements .",
    "however , it seems that the prover might be able to cheat by using entanglement between the different copies . using the markov inequality ,",
    "we show that this is impossible .",
    "next , we show    [ thm : gapcvp ] the problem @xmath38 is in @xmath5 for some constant @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath39 is a variant of @xmath40 where we are given the additional promise that the shortest vector in @xmath9 is longer than @xmath11 .",
    "the proof of this theorem is very involved , but the idea is as follows .    the correct quantum witness @xmath41 for @xmath33 , i.e. , the witness in case @xmath13 is far from the lattice , is defined as follows ( a similar state appears in @xcite which can be seen as the quantum analogue of the probability distribution of @xcite ) . consider the ` probability distribution ' obtained by choosing a random lattice point and adding to it a gaussian of radius @xmath42 .",
    "we define @xmath41 as the superposition corresponding to this probability distribution .",
    "see figure [ fig : witness ] .",
    "actually , the state @xmath41 can not be defined as above , since we can not represent a point in @xmath28 with infinite precision , so we need to work over a very fine grid .",
    "moreover , the number of grid points in @xmath28 is infinite .",
    "hence , we restrict the state to grid points inside the basic parallelepiped of the lattice .",
    "we will define this formally later ; it is best to keep in mind the continuous picture .    given this superposition , for some constant @xmath43 , solving @xmath38 ( and in fact also @xmath44 )",
    "is easy : it is done by estimating the inner product of the above state with the same state shifted by @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath45 then the inner product is almost zero since the gaussians and their shifted version do not intersect . if @xmath46 , the inner product is large since the two states are almost the same . to show containment in @xmath5 , we will use this state as the correct witness .",
    "hence , it remains to show how a super - verifier can verify that the prover is not cheating .",
    "cheating in this context means that @xmath46 but the prover claims that @xmath47 and sends some witness which is not necessarily the correct witness .",
    "we now define the verification process .",
    "define @xmath48 to be the real part of the inner product of the given witness state with itself shifted by @xmath49 .",
    "we call @xmath50 the autocorrelation function of the witness .",
    "it is a function from @xmath28 to @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "we define @xmath53 to be the same , for the correct witness @xmath41 .",
    "an important property of @xmath50 is that for any @xmath49 , there exists a quantum circuit whose probability of outputting @xmath10 is directly related to @xmath48 .",
    "hence , since a super - verifier can check the probability of outputting @xmath10 , it can effectively check that @xmath48 is close to some value . since we expect to see the correct witness , we construct a super - verifier that checks that @xmath48 is close to @xmath54 for some vectors @xmath49 .",
    "more precisely , with probability half the super - verifier chooses the vector @xmath13 and otherwise it randomly chooses a polynomially short vector .    in order to complete the description of the super - verifier",
    ", we have to show that it can compute @xmath54 for the points chosen above .",
    "later in the paper we analyze the function @xmath53 and it turns out to have a familiar form : it is very close to a periodic gaussian , like the one shown in figure [ fig : witness ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 is approximately zero since @xmath13 is far from the lattice and @xmath54 for short vectors @xmath49 has the form @xmath56 . in both cases ,",
    "the super - verifier knows the value of @xmath53 and can therefore perform the verification procedure described above .",
    "we remark that analyzing @xmath53 involves some technical calculations ; it is here that we need the assumption that the shortest vector in the lattice is large , so that the gaussians are well separated and do not interfere with each other .",
    "the proof of soundness of this test uses the observation that autocorrelation functions are necessarily positive definite .",
    "a function @xmath57 is positive definite ( pd ) if for any @xmath58 and any @xmath59 points @xmath60 , the @xmath61 matrix @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 is positive semidefinite .",
    "notice that no matter what witness the prover gives , the function @xmath50 must be pd since it is an autocorrelation function .",
    "we will complete the proof by showing that no pd @xmath50 exists which passes the above test if @xmath64 , i.e. , no pd function exists which is both close to @xmath34 at a vector @xmath13 whose distance to @xmath9 is at most @xmath65 , and also close to a gaussian at many randomly chosen points polynomially close to the origin .",
    "why does nt such a pd function exist ?",
    "intuitively , our proof relies on certain non - local behaviors of positive definite functions .",
    "namely , we will show that changing the value of a pd function at even one point affects the function at many other points .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 is close to @xmath34 and @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a point which is equal to @xmath13 modulo the lattice ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) such that @xmath70 .",
    "such a point exists since @xmath67 . as we will see later , we can guarantee that @xmath50 is periodic on the lattice and hence @xmath71 is close to @xmath34 .",
    "we start with a simple property of positive definite functions which can be obtained from using @xmath72 matrices in the definition : if @xmath73 is close to @xmath34 then @xmath74 is at most @xmath75 and similarly , @xmath76 is at most @xmath77 . by repeating the argument",
    "we derive an upper bound on @xmath78 where @xmath79 for some @xmath80 .",
    "the point @xmath81 is polynomially close to the origin and the upper bound is much smaller than the correct gaussian value , @xmath82 .",
    "this shows that the super - verifier can detect a cheating prover by choosing the point @xmath81 .",
    "however , the super - verifier does not know where @xmath13 is relative to the lattice and therefore he can not compute @xmath68 or @xmath81 .",
    "the probability that our randomly chosen point happens to be @xmath81 is negligible .",
    "thus , we will have to derive stronger properties of the function @xmath50 .",
    "these will be obtained by considering the positive definite condition with @xmath83 matrices . essentially",
    ", we will show that for any point @xmath49 which is almost orthogonal to @xmath81 , it can not be that @xmath48 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are all close to their correct values @xmath86 .",
    "this means that one of the points in the triple @xmath87 is such that the verifier detects a cheating prover by choosing it .",
    "using the fact that @xmath81 was chosen to be polynomially short , we will argue that all three points in a triple have roughly the same probability to be chosen by the verifier .",
    "hence , a cheating prover is caught with non - negligible probability , and the soundness of the protocol follows .",
    "curiously , it seems essential in our proof to use gaussians and not spheres .",
    "this is unlike the classical proof of @xcite that seems to work both with spheres and with gaussians . essentially , the difference between the two distributions is in the behavior of their autocorrelation functions . for gaussians ,",
    "the autocorrelation with a short vector @xmath49 behaves like @xmath88 while for spheres it behaves like @xmath89 where @xmath90 are some constants . in the proof , using properties of positive definite functions obtained from @xmath83 matrices , we obtain an upper bound of the form @xmath91 for some constant @xmath92 .",
    "this yields a contradiction since @xmath93 .",
    "however , if we used spheres , we would not obtain any contradiction since @xmath94 for short vectors @xmath49 .    to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , we need the final theorem :    [ thm : cvptosvp ] for any @xmath95 , if @xmath96 is in @xmath4 then so is @xmath97 .",
    "the proof of this theorem uses an idea similar to @xcite .",
    "essentially , an instance of @xmath97 can be translated into @xmath8 instances of @xmath96 .",
    "if there is no short vector in the original lattice then in all the @xmath98 instances the target vector is far from the lattice .",
    "otherwise , if there exists a short vector then in at least one of the @xmath98 instances , the target vector is close to the lattice .",
    "based on this idea , we construct a quantum verifier for @xmath97 .",
    "the witness it expects to see is a concatenation of the @xmath8 witnesses of the corresponding @xmath96 problems .",
    "it applies a @xmath96 verifier to each one of the copies and accepts if and only if they all accept .",
    "for @xmath99 , define @xmath100 as @xmath101 .",
    "for any @xmath102 , we will often denote @xmath103 by @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 denote the @xmath8-dimensional unit ball and let @xmath106 denote its volume .",
    "for a vector @xmath102 let @xmath107 denote the @xmath108 dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath49 .",
    "for a vector @xmath102 and a subspace @xmath109 let @xmath110 denote the projection of @xmath49 on the subspace @xmath109 .",
    "we will slightly abuse notation by denoting the projection of @xmath49 on the subspace spanned by a vector @xmath13 as @xmath111 .",
    "for an introduction to lattices , see @xcite . a lattice in @xmath28",
    "is defined as the set of all integer combinations of @xmath8 linearly independent vectors .",
    "this set of vectors is known as a basis of the lattice and is not unique .",
    "given a basis @xmath112 of a lattice @xmath9 , the fundamental parallelepiped is defined as @xmath113 when the basis is clear from the context we will use the notation @xmath114 instead of @xmath115 .",
    "note that a lattice has a different fundamental parallelepiped for each possible basis .",
    "for a point @xmath102 we define @xmath116 as the minimum of @xmath117 over all @xmath118 .    for a lattice @xmath119 and a point @xmath102",
    "we define @xmath120 as the unique point @xmath121 such that @xmath122 is an integer combination of @xmath123 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notice that a function @xmath124 can be naturally extended to a function @xmath125 by defining @xmath126 .",
    "we will often refer to values of functions outside of @xmath114 , in which case we mean the periodicity above .",
    "we will also use , for technical proofs , the notion of a voronoi cell of l , denoted @xmath127 , which is the set of all points in @xmath28 which are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point .",
