    "gluon and ghost propagators are powerful tools in the ( non - perturbative ) investigation of the infra - red ( ir ) limit of qcd and are thus of central importance for understanding confinement ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , according to the gribov - zwanziger @xcite and to the kugo - ojima @xcite confinement scenarios in landau gauge , the ghost propagator must show a divergent behavior  stronger than @xmath12  for vanishing momentum @xmath13 .",
    "this strong infrared divergence corresponds to a long - range interaction in real space , which may be related to quark confinement . at the same time , according to the former scenario , the gluon propagator must be suppressed and may go to zero in the ir limit @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the real - space gluon propagator is positive and negative in equal measure , i.e.  reflection positivity is maximally violated @xcite , indicating absence of gluons from the physical spectrum ( gluon confinement ) .",
    "these predictions are also valid for the case of pure @xmath0 gauge theory and for three space - time dimensions .",
    "the nonperturbative evaluation of gluon and ghost propagators can be achieved by first principles methods such as dyson - schwinger equations ( dse s ) @xcite or the numerical simulation of lattice qcd .",
    "landau - gauge studies of dse s ( see e.  g.@xcite ) have found an ir behavior of the form @xmath14 [ implying @xmath15 if @xmath16 for the gluon propagator and of the form @xmath17 for the ghost propagator , with the same exponent @xmath18 ( i.e.  with @xmath19 ) .",
    "the available predictions for the ir exponent point towards @xmath20 for pure @xmath21 gauge theory in the four dimensional case . for the @xmath22 case",
    "the exponents are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that in the @xmath25 dimensional case @xcite the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , implying for the quantity @xmath29 the infrared behavior @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in the 4-dimensional case the running coupling @xmath31 displays and infrared fixed point .",
    "numerical studies of lattice gauge theories confirm the ir divergence of the landau ghost propagator @xcite and have now also established that the landau gluon propagator shows a turnover in the ir region , attaining a finite value for @xmath32 .",
    "( a reliable extrapolation of @xmath33 to the infinite - volume limit is still lacking @xcite . ) more precisely , indications of a decreasing gluon propagator for small @xmath13 have been obtained in the @xmath34 @xmath0 and @xmath35 cases for the strong - coupling regime @xcite , in the @xmath22 @xmath0 case ( also in the scaling region ) @xcite , in the @xmath22 @xmath0 adjoint higgs model @xcite and in the @xmath34 @xmath0 case at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the actual turning of the gluon propagator has been seen clearly for the equal - time three - dimensional transverse gluon propagator in @xmath34 @xmath0 coulomb gauge @xcite , for the @xmath22 @xmath0 landau case using very large lattices @xcite ( of 140 lattice sites per direction ) and  recently  in the @xmath34 @xmath35 landau case with the use of asymmetric lattices @xcite .",
    "thus , the two nonperturbative approaches above seem to support the gribov - zwanziger and the kugo - ojima confinement scenarios in landau gauge . however , the agreement between the two methods is still at the qualitative level , at least when considering the gluon and the ghost propagators .",
    "moreover , recent lattice studies @xcite seem to indicate a null ir limit for @xmath31 , instead of a finite nonzero value .",
    "of course , in this case , special care must be taken to eliminate finite - size effects , especially when the ir region is considered @xcite . this issue has also been studied analitically using dse s @xcite , showing that torus and continuum solutions are qualitatively different .",
    "this suggests a nontrivial relation between studies on compact and on noncompact manifolds .",
    "finally , the nonrenormalizability of the ghost - gluon vertex  proven at the perturbative level @xcite , confirmed on the lattice @xcite ( for @xmath36 mev ) and used in dse studies to simplify the coupled set of equations  has been recently criticized in ref .",
    "thus , clear quantitative understanding of the two confinement scenarios is still an open problem .    in this work",
    "we extend the study presented in @xcite for the @xmath22 @xmath0 case , by including results for the ghost propagators from very large lattices and by considering also asymmetric lattices , as done in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to verify possible systematic effects related to the use of asymmetric lattices ( as suggested in @xcite ) , by comparing the results to the ones obtained for symmetric lattices . in particular , we focus on the determination of the ir critical exponents @xmath37 and @xmath38 and on their extrapolation to the infinite - volume limit . the study of gluon and ghost propagators in three space - time dimensions is computationally much simpler than in the four - dimensional case and it may help to get a better understanding of the @xmath34 case @xcite . note that the @xmath22 case is also of interest in finite - temperature qcd ( see for example @xcite ) .    in the following section",
    "we describe our simulations and present our results .",
    "we end with our conclusions .",
    "simulations have been done using the standard wilson action for @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in three dimensions with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider @xmath7 and several lattice volumes , up to @xmath39 . in table",
    "[ tab : runs ] we report , for each lattice volume @xmath8 , the parameters used for the simulations .",
    "all our runs start with a random gauge configuration .",
    "we used the _ hybrid overrelaxed _",
    "algorithm ( hor ) @xcite for thermalization and the _ stochastic overrelaxation _ algorithm or the so - called _ cornell method _ for gauge fixing thermalized configurations to the lattice landau gauge @xcite .",
    "the numerical code is parallelized using mpi @xcite . for the random number generator we use a double - precision implementation of ranlux ( version 2.1 ) with luxury level set to 2 .",
    "computations were performed on the pc clusters at the ifsc - usp .",
    "we ran part of the @xmath40 lattices on three nodes and the @xmath10 lattices on four or eight nodes .",
    ".lattice volumes @xmath8 , configurations , hor sweeps used for thermalization and between two configurations ( used for evaluating both propagators ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us also note that in figures [ fig : gluon1 ] and [ fig : gluon2 ] the gluon propagator at zero momentum @xmath33 is monotonically decreasing when considered as a function of the lattice volume @xmath8 . on the other hand , if one considers the symmetric lattice @xmath41 and the slightly larger asymmetric lattice @xmath42 , one finds ( see figure [ fig : gluon3 ] ) that @xmath43 is _ larger _",
    "( by about @xmath44 ) in the asymmetric case .",
    "thus , an extrapolation of @xmath33 to infinite volume using data from asymmetric lattices is most likely also affected by systematic effects .",
    "we also tried a fit to the data using the fitting functions considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see results in table [ tab : fit_gluon ] ) .",
    "we see that the ir exponent @xmath37 usually increases with the lattice volume , in agreement with the results reported in table 2 of ref .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ fig : extrap ] that the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath45 is not simple .",
    "indeed , @xmath37 looks almost constant when considering @xmath46 and @xmath47 , but it gets a larger value when using the symmetric  and much larger  lattice volumes @xmath48 and @xmath10 .",
    "a smaller value for @xmath37 is also found if one tries an extrapolation as a function of @xmath49 for the results obtained using the three asymmetric lattices @xmath50 .",
    "again , it could be difficult to have systematic errors under control when trying an extrapolation using only asymmetric lattices .",
    "strong systematic effects can also be observed in the ghost case .",
    "the propagator is less ir divergent when one considers asymmetric lattices ( see figures [ fig : ghost1 ] and [ fig : ghost3 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the ir exponent @xmath38 is also smaller ( see table [ tab : fit_ghost ] ) for asymmetric lattices .",
    "this is the case either when comparing an asymmetric lattice to a symmetric one with almost equal lattice volume ( i.e.  @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) or when considering an asymmetric lattice and a symmetric one with the same largest lattice side ( e.g.  @xmath53 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the lattice volume is very different in the two cases . indeed , for symmetric lattices ( e.g.  @xmath52 , @xmath40 and @xmath10 ) , the ir exponent decreases as the lattice volume @xmath8 increases ( at fixed @xmath54 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the result obtained in the @xmath34 @xmath0 case ( see table 4 and figure 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath38 increases as a function of v for the lattices @xmath50 with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "thus , there is no simple relation between @xmath38 and @xmath56 and an extrapolation in @xmath56 using asymmetric lattices is probably of difficult interpretation .",
    "using the above results we can evaluate the quantity @xmath57 , which is zero using dse s @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath58 for @xmath9 and @xmath59 for @xmath39 .",
    "for the asymmetric lattices this value is somewhat larger .",
    "however , let us note that these results depend on the choice of the fitting function .",
    "moreover , the null value for @xmath57 should be obtained only in the infinite - volume and in the continuum limit .",
    "we will analyze these limits in a future study .    in this work",
    "we did not do a careful study of gribov - copy effects @xcite , since we are interested in possible systematic effects due to the use of asymmetric lattices .",
    "( defined using gluon and ghost propagators ) . ] nevertheless , for the gluon propagator and @xmath52 and @xmath4 , we compare results obtained using a standard gauge - fixing algorithm to data obtained with the so - called smearing method @xcite .",
    "( in this case we considered 2000 configurations for each lattice volume and each gauge - fixing method . )",
    "we found that for @xmath60 the value of @xmath33 is @xmath61 when using the smearing method , while one gets @xmath62 with a standard gauge - fixing method .",
    "the two results differ by several standard deviations and the propagator is smaller when using the smearing method , i.e.  as one gets closer to the so - called fundamental modular region . on the contrary , for @xmath63 we found @xmath64 with smearing and @xmath65 without smearing . in this case",
    "the relative difference between the two cases is smaller and the result using smearing is _ larger _ than in the standard case .",
    "this seems to be a systematic effect , which we observe for the first nine smaller momenta , when considering the asymmetric lattice .",
    "we believe that this issue deserves a more careful analysis .",
    "we have compared data for gluon and ghost propagators ( in minimal landau gauge ) obtained using symmetric and asymmetric lattices .",
    "we find , for both propagators , clear evidences of systematic effects at relatively small momenta ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "in particular , the gluon ( respectively , ghost ) propagator is less suppressed ( respec .  enhanced ) in the ir limit when considering asymmetric lattices than for the case of symmetric lattices .",
    "this implies that the estimates for the ir critical exponents @xmath27 and @xmath37 are systematically smaller in the asymmetric case compared to the symmetric one .",
    "also , for the gluon propagator , the turnover point @xmath67 is significantly smaller when considering asymmetric lattices than for the symmetric ones .",
    "let us recall that @xmath68 corresponds to the gribov mass scale in a gribov - like propagator @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we have seen that the extrapolation to infinite volume of results obtained using asymmetric lattices is also most likely affected by systematic errors .",
    "we conclude that , even though using an asymmetric lattice does not modify the qualitative behavior of the two propagators , one should be careful in extracting quantitative information from such studies .",
    "our data have been obtained in the @xmath22 @xmath0 case .",
    "however , the behavior observed for the gluon propagator is very similar to what is obtained in the @xmath34 @xmath35 case @xcite , where of course a study of this type is more complicated .",
