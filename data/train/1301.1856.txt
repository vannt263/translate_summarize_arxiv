    "in the last years , the determination of stellar rotation rates for large samples of stars with different masses and ages in young open clusters , has made substantial progress , providing a large observational sampling of the angular momentum evolution of pre - main sequence stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the precise mechanisms governing angular momentum evolution of pre - main sequence low - mass stars are still not well understood , but basically they can be schematized with two main competing processes : star contraction and star - disk interaction .",
    "stars in the pre - main sequence phase are still contracting , thus increasing their angular velocity to conserve the angular momentum . on the other hand , the observed existence of slow rotators and of a wide dispersion in rotation rates of cluster stars on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) ,",
    "can be explained only with the presence of a competing mechanism of angular momentum loss ( i.e. spin down of the star ) , different from star to star , during the pre - main sequence phase .",
    "it is generally believed that this mechanism can be explained by the magnetic interaction between stellar magnetospheres and circumstellar disks , in a scenario known as _ disk - locking _ ,",
    "first proposed by @xcite and @xcite and explained in detail by @xcite , which assumes that the angular momentum deposited on an accreting star ( due to mass accretion from disk to star , @xcite ) is exactly removed by torques carried along magnetic field lines connecting the star to the disk .",
    "the wide dispersion of rotational velocities observed on the zams is the result of different disk lifetimes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several observational results indicate a relation between the presence of disks and rotational evolution , in particular population of stars with disks , on average , rotate more slowly than those without disks and does exist a statistically significant anti - correlation between angular velocity and disk indicators such as near - infrared excess and @xmath0 equivalent width ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the disk - locking scenario predicts that the torques arising from the magnetic connection between the star and the disk remove substantial angular momentum enforcing an equilibrium angular spin rate ( ) which is in agreement with the constant rotation period in the 2 - 8 days range , characteristic of the majority of young stars .",
    "however , there have been several conflicting theoretical and observational evidences concerning the role of disk - locking scenario in the evolution of low mass pre - main sequence stars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the p@xmath1 distribution histograms for weak t - tauri stars ( wttss , whose periodic variability is believed to be induced by large starspots ) and classical t - tauri stars ( cttss , whose variability may be also due to accretion spots and shadowing of the photosphere from dusty disk structures ) in ngc 2264 are very similar and do not indicate that cttss are rotating more slowly than their wtts counterparts . furthermore , @xcite did not find a correlation between p@xmath1 and theoretical age , as might be expected if stars were spinning up after decoupling from their disks . @xcite and did not find a correlation between accretion and rotation in onc and ic 348 low mass stars , respectively ( though they do not conclude that their results are inconsistent with disk - locking ) .",
    "we have to note that most of the samples for which there is no clear evidence of a connection between the existence of disks and slow rotation , suffer from several biases , such as small sample size , sample biased toward small - mass or high - mass stars , the use of nir photometry as disk indicator or the use of @xmath2 values instead of rotation periods , which make them unsuited to perform this kind of test , on star - disk interaction outcomes .",
    "in particular , the presence of a near - infrared excess does not garantee that the star is actually accreting mass from a disk .",
    "the studies of and @xcite , based on _ spitzer _ mid - infrared observations , however , as well as demonstrating that objects which currently show mid - infrared excesses are more likely accreting than not , also found differences in the rotational properties of accreting and non accreting stars for ngc 2264 and the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , respectively , and represent the best test case to date , providing the strongest evidence that star - disk interaction regulates the angular momentum evolution of pre - main sequence stars .",
    "+ the idea and the basic assumptions of disk - locking , sketched above , are a simplification of a much more complex phenomenon , and indeed several discussions on the shortcomings of the theory and its confrontation with observations have been put forward . in particular , @xcite critically examined the theory of disk locking , noting that the differential rotation between the star and disk naturally leads to an opening ( i.e. , disconnecting ) of the magnetic field between the two .",
    "they find that this significantly reduces the spin - down torque on the star by the disk , thus , disk - locking can not account ( at least , alone ) for the slow rotation observed in several systems and for which the model was originally developed .",
    "@xcite supported the idea that stellar winds may be important during the accretion phase , they may be powered by the accretion process itself and be the key driver of angular momentum loss (; ; ) .",
    "a strong magnetically driven wind , as proposed by , is an idea which deserves further study , as well as the development of a more realistic theorical model able to explain the full range of observed rotation periods and magnetic phenomena and the achievement of a sufficient amount of accurate data to empirically constrain them . + ngc 2264 is one of the best known studied star forming regions in the solar vicinity ( d@xmath3 760 pc , age @xmath3 3 myr ) and",
    "is considered a benchmark for the study of star formation processes in our galaxy .",
    "ngc 2264 luckily falls in the small portion of the sky accessible by corot ( convection rotation and planetary transits , @xcite ) , and thus represents a unique chance for the mission and the study of young stars still in a formation phase .",
    "its distance and age make it an ideal corot target , its size is well suited to the corot field of view , with a large fraction of cluster members falling in the appropriate magnitude range for accurate photometric monitoring in the corot observations .",
    "+ ngc 2264 has been extensively observed at all wavelengths from radio to x - rays ( see @xcite , for a review on the region ) , for studies of the star formation process through the observation of its outcomes : the initial mass function ( e.g. @xcite ) , the star formation history , and the spatial structure ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 2264 is also a primary target for the study of the evolution of the stellar angular momentum and its relation to circumstellar accretion ( e.g. @xcite ) , of the evolution ( and dispersal ) of circumstellar disks ( e.g. @xcite ) and of the correlation between optical and x - ray variability of young stars ( @xcite ) . among several optical , ir , and x - ray surveys ,",
    "both photometric and spectroscopic , on ngc 2264 , the most recent are : @xcite , who has provided the widest area and deepest publicy available optical photometry ; @xcite , who has published _ spitzer _",
    "( irac + mips ) photometry ; @xcite and @xcite , who have published spectral types , h@xmath4 , and li equivalent widths , from low - dispersion spectra , for a total of @xmath5 500 members ; @xcite , who has published radial velocities for 436 stars . + @xcite performed a photometric monitoring of about 10600 stars to search for periodic and irregular variable pre - main sequence stars and found 543 periodic variables with periods between 0.2 days and 15 days , and 484 irregular variables .",
    "@xcite used this extensive study to conclude that the period distribution in ngc 2264 is similar to that of the orion nebula cluster , though shifted toward shorter periods ( confirming the conclusion of @xcite , based on the analysis of the rotation rates of 35 candidate members , that the stars in ngc 2264 are spun up with respect to members of the orion nebula cluster ) .",
    "+ the period distribution found by @xcite is unimodal for masses lower than 0.25 m@xmath6 while it is bimodal for more massive stars .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for disk locking with a constant period , among 30% of the higher mass stars ( with a locking period of @xmath58 days ) , while disk - locking is less important among lower mass stars , whose peak in the period distribution at 2 - 3 days , suggests that these stars have undergone a low rate of angular momentum loss from star - disk interaction , while not completely locked ( an evolution scenario defined by @xcite as `` moderate '' angular momentum loss ) .",
    "+ the bimodality is interpreted as an effect of disk - star interactions in pre - main sequence stars , slow rotators being interpreted as stars that are magnetically locked to their disks , preventing them from spinning up with time and accounting for the broad period distribution of zams stars .",
    "this assumption is supported by some observational results showing that wttss are rotating faster than cttss with inner disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the hypothesis that accreting stars rotate more slowly than non accreting ones is still a matter of debate , since conflicting evidence exists ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) , as explained above .",
    "+ the corot satellite has allowed us to conduct a large scale survey of photometric variability of ngc 2264 .",
    "thanks to the accurate high - cadence photometry and large field of view of corot , we could study rotation and activity of about 8000 stars in a 3.4 sq.degree region .",
    "the entire star - forming region fits into a single corot field of view , and the campaign resulted in continuous 23-day light curves for 301 known cluster members brighter than v@xmath316 ( m=0.3 - 0.4 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "the resulting optical broad - band light curves are the first accurate , highest cadence ( 32 or 512 seconds ) , longest duration , data set available for @xmath33 myr old stars . + so far , the corot ngc 2264 data have been used to study the correlation between optical and x - ray variability in young stars ( @xcite ) ; asteroseismological properties of two high mass cluster members ( @xcite ) ; and to identify and study the behaviour of ngc 2264 members that are aa tau - like ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ @xcite demonstrated that the peculiar photometric behaviour of aa tau , which consist in a flat maximum in the light curve interrupted by deep quasi - periodical minima ( due to obscuring material with a variable structure which is located in the inner disk region , near the corotation radius ) , that vary in depth and width from one rotational cycle to the other , is quite common among cttss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the interpretation for aa tau",
    "can now be considered quite solid , and it s extension to an high fraction of cttss simply requires that the size of the obscuring clump of material ( e.g. the height of the inner disk warp ) is larger than previously thought . + in a rather similar scenario of circumstellar material orbiting the star and consequent time - variable shading , @xcite found evidence of a correlation between soft x - ray and optical variability of cttss ( no correlation is apparent in the hard band ) , while no correlation in either band ( soft and hard ) is present in wttss .",
    "@xcite suggested that this observation is consistent with a scenario in which a significant fraction of the x - ray and optical emission from cttss is affected by temporally variable shading and obscuration .",
    "+ the conclusions of both @xcite and @xcite point toward a different origin of the observed periods , suggesting a difference both in the physical and morphological properties of cttss and wttss .",
    "+ in this paper we derive accurate rotational periods of known ngc 2264 members , testing whether a relationship between accretion and rotation exists in pre - main sequence stars .",
    "+ in the following we describe the observational and data reduction strategy ( sect .  [ obs ] and [ red ] ) . in section  [ discuss ]",

    "a total of 8150 stars were observed , with right ascension ( ra ) between 99.4@xmath7 and 100.9@xmath7 and declination ( dec ) between 7.6@xmath7 and 10.3@xmath7 and r magnitudes from 9.2 to 16.0 .",
    "the sample includes 301 cluster members ( see sec .",
    "[ red ] for details regarding membership criteria ) .",
    "we used the so called n2 data delivered by the corot pipeline ( @xcite ) after correction of the electronic offset , gain , electromagnetic interference , and outliers .",
    "the pipeline includes background subtraction and partial jitter correction .",
    "low quality data points , e.g. taken during the south atlantic anomaly crossing or due to hot pixels events , are flagged .",
    "some of the stars have light curves in three separate but ill - defined bands ( red , green , and blue ) . in these cases our analysis was conducted on the white - light data obtained by summing the three bands .",
    "the light curves are sampled at a rate of 512 s or oversampled at 32 s. all the light curves presented here were rebinned to 512 sec .",
    "using corot photometry we are able to reveal luminosity variation , with a precision down to 0.1 mmag per hour ( magnitude between 11 and 16 ) , during continuous observations , allowing to measure photometric periods also in relatively quiet stars ( for comparison , the luminosity variations of the sun range between @xmath50.3 mmag and @xmath50.07 mmag at maximum and minimum activity , respectively , @xcite ) .",
    "we selected 301 cluster stars ( whose spatial distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as big dots ) satisfying one or more of the following membership criteria ( the number of objects which fulfill the various criteria is indicated near each criterium ) :    * detection in x - rays by chandra acis or xmm - newton ( @xcite ; @xcite + flaccomio et al .",

    "the threshold between these two classes is a function of spectral type , as suggested by @xcite and deeply analyzed by .",

    "we decided to exclude intermediate ews ( 5 @xmath11 ew@xmath8 @xmath11 10  ) , though not a usual procedure when dealing with h@xmath4 , to keep the two sample of cttss and wttss well separate and thus avoid possible ambiguity in the classification . in fig .",

    "+          the presence of periodic signals was detected using the lomb normalized periodogram ( lnp ) technique ( @xcite , ) . with this algorithm we calculated the normalized power @xmath12 as function of angular frequency @xmath13 and identified the location of the highest peak in the periodogram . in order to decide the significance of the peak we have followed @xcite , randomizing the temporal bins from the original light curve . by calculating the maximum power on a large number of randomized data sets , the conversion from power to false alarm probability ( fap ) can be determined . in detail",
    ", we constructed 1000 light curves _ resampled _ from the original ones randomizing the position of blocks of adjacent temporal bins ( block length , 12 h ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . by shuffling the data we break any possible time correlation and periodicity of the light curve on time scales longer than the block duration .",
    "we calculated the scargle periodogram for all the randomized light curves and we compared the maximum from the real periodogram to the distribution obtained from the randomized light curves , at the same frequency , in order to establish the probability that values as high as the observed one are due to random fluctuations .",
    "given some threshold fap@xmath14 we state that the detected candidate periodicity is statistically not significant if fap @xmath15 fap@xmath14 .",
    "the calculation we performed on corot light curves led often to small faps , indicating that lnps of our light curves present peaks that in most cases can not be explained by pure stochastic noise , or non - periodic variability on time scales shorter than 12 h. in fact , if light curves present variations on time scale smaller than the size of the temporal block we used in the simulations , these variations will be still present in the simulated curves and will be not recognized as significant ( more details in @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen a bin size of 12 h as a reasonable compromise between the expected time scale of stochastic variations and the shortest expected periodic signal . once significant peaks",

    "+ autocorrelation takes each point of the light curve measured at time @xmath16 and compares the value of that point to another at time @xmath17 .",
    "points separated by @xmath18 will have very similar values if the data contained some variability with period @xmath18 , thus the autocorrelation function will have peaks corresponding to periods of variability in the data .",

    "the correlogram for a time series is a plot of the autocorrelation coefficients @xmath22 as a function of l. a time series is random if it consists of a series of independent observations with the same distribution . in this case",
    "we would expect the @xmath22 to be statistically not significant for all values of @xmath18 .",
    "we have chosen to adopt a 95% confidence level to select significant autocorrelation coefficient .",
    "+            following @xcite , morphologically we can divide the lcs in four groups : 1 ) spot - like periodic lcs , whose periodicity can be interpreted as rotational modulation of surface features such as cool and/or hot spots ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , top left panel ) ; 2 ) aa tau - like systems , whose quasi - periodicity is likely caused by the obscuration of the stellar photosphere by circumstellar disk material ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , top right panel ) , the stability of the spot - like lcs on the timescale of the observations , makes them easily distinguishable from the aa tau - like ones ; 3 ) irregular lcs , whose non - periodic brightness modulations ( some of them with peak - to - peak variations up to 1 mag ) are probably due to a complex mixing of non - steady accretion phenomena , and obscuration by non - uniformly distributed circumstellar material , as suggested by @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , bottom left panel ) ; 4 ) non - variable lcs which do not display an obvious periodicity , most of which looks like noisy lcs with small variability amplitude @xmath9 1% ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "+ to evaluate a short term variability amplitude of the lc , we calculated the running median flux , obtained using a temporal bin set up by 15 time points ( thus , a time scale of 15@xmath23512 s ) , we calculated for each time value the difference between the instantaneous flux and the running median flux derived at the corrisponding time , obtaining an array .",
    "we measured the amplitude variation of the lc as the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of this array .",

    "<S> rotation is one of the key stellar parameters which undergo substantial evolution during the stellar lifetime , in particular during the early stages . </S>",
    "<S> stellar rotational periods can be determined on the basis of the periodic modulation of starlight produced by non - uniformities on the surface of the stars , due to manifestation of stellar activity . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of an extensive search for rotational periods among ngc 2264 cluster members , based on photometric monitoring using the corot satellite , with a particular attention to the distribution of classical and weak - line t - tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 2264 is one of the nearest and best studied star forming region in the solar neighbourhood , with an estimated age of 3 myr , and is the object of a recent simultaneous multiband campaign including a new corot observation with the aim to assess the physical origin of the observed variability . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rotational distributions of classical and weak - line t - tauri star are different , suggesting a difference in the rotational properties of accreting and non - accreting stars . </S>",
