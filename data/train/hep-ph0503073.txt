    "the observation of the new baryon @xmath6 with positive strangeness and minimal quark content @xmath7 @xcite has motivated intense theoretical investigations to clarify its quantum numbers and to understand the under - structures @xcite . through the pentaquark state @xmath6 can be signed to the top of the antidecuplet @xmath8 with isospin @xmath9 , the spin and parity have not been experimentally determined yet and no consensus has ever been reached on the theoretical side @xcite . the discovery has opened a new field of strong interaction and provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of low energy qcd especially when multiquarks are involved .",
    "the magnetic moments of the pentaquark states are fundamental parameters as their masses , which have copious information about the underlying quark structures i.e. different substructures result in different predictions , can be used to distinguish the preferred configurations from various theoretical models and deepen our understanding of the underlying dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic moment of the pentaquark state @xmath6 is an important ingredient in studying the cross sections of the photo- or electro - production , which can be used to determine the fundamental quantum number of the pentaquark state @xmath6 , such as spin and parity @xcite , and may be extracted from experiments eventually in the near future .",
    "there have been several works on the magnetic moments of the pentaquark state @xmath6 @xcite , in this article , we take the point of view that the @xmath10 baryon is diquark - diquark - antiquark ( @xmath1[ud]\\bar{s}$ ] ) state with the quantum numbers @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , and study its magnetic moment in the framework of the light - cone qcd sum rules approach , which carries out the operator product expansion near the light - cone @xmath13 instead of the short distance @xmath14 while the nonperturbative matrix elements are parameterized by the light - cone distribution amplitudes which classified according to their twists instead of the vacuum condensates @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the light - cone qcd sum rules for the magnetic moment of the pentaquark state @xmath6 in section ii ; in section iii , numerical results ; section iv is reserved for conclusion .",
    "we can study the magnetic moments of the baryons using two - point correlation functions in an external electromagnetic field , with vacuum susceptibilities introduced as parameters for nonperturbative propagation in the external field , i.e. the qcd sum rules in the external field @xcite . as nonperturbative vacuum properties",
    ", the susceptibilities can be introduced for both small and large momentum transfers in the external fields .",
    "the alternative way is the light - cone qcd sum rules approach , which was firstly used to calculate the magnetic moments of nucleons in ref.@xcite . for more discussions about the magnetic moments of the baryons in the framework of the light - cone qcd sum rules approach",
