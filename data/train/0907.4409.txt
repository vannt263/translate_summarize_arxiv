    "since larson et al . ( 1980 ) discussed removal of galactic halo gas from disk galaxies in terms of transformation from spirals into s0s , many observational and theoretical works investigated evolution of galactic halo gas in variously different aspects of galaxy evolution , such as maintenance of spiral arms by halo gas infall ( e.g. , sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) , formation of passive spiral galaxies in groups and clusters ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2002 ) , and color evolution of satellite galaxies entering into their host group- and cluster - scale halos ( e.g. , font et al .",
    "one of important suggestions from these previous works is that stripping of galactic halo gas can cause severe suppression of galactic global star formation in different environments ( `` strangulation '' ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "although the strangulation scenario can explain a number of recent observational results of galaxies , such as the presence of red passive spirals in distant clusters ( e.g. , couch et al .",
    "1998 , dressler et al . 1999 ,",
    "poggianti et al",
    ". 1999 , 2008 ) and mean star formation rate dependent on galaxy environments ( e.g. balogh et al . 2004 ) , it is still less clear why and how effective strangulation can occur in different environments ( e.g. , groups and clusters ) .",
    "previous theoretical and numerical studies tried to understand how galactic halo gas responds to environmental effects , such as tidal fields of groups and clusters ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2001 ) and ram pressure stripping of igm ( e.g. , balogh et al . 2000 ; bekki et al . 2002",
    "; hester 2006 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "although these works discussed quantitatively how much fraction of halo gas can be removed from galaxy - scale halos by ram pressure of igm in their host environments , their models are not so sophisticated at some points . for example , previous numerical models ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2002 ) do not adopt realistic galaxy models with stellar and gaseous disks and ignores hydrodynamical interaction between halo and disk gas .",
    "more sophisticated numerical models are required to discuss more qualitatively how much fraction of halo gas can be removed by ram pressure stripping and whether and how hydrodynamical interaction between halo and disk gas can influence ram pressure stripping of halo gas in disk galaxies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the purpose of this paper is thus to investigate time evolution of galactic halo gas in disk galaxies under moderately strong ram pressure of igm in their host environments based on more sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "we focus mainly on ( i ) final mass fractions of halo gas stripped from disk galaxies ( @xmath0 ) , ( ii ) radial properties of halo gas , and ( iii ) dependences of ( i ) and ( ii ) on physical properties of galaxy environments ( e.g. , total masses of groups and clusters ) .",
    "the present results can be used for interpreting observational results on spatial distribution of hot halo gas in galaxies ( e.g. , jeltema et al .",
    "2008 ) , physical properties of passive spirals in groups and clusters ( e.g. , poggianti et al . 2008",
    "; bamford et al . 2009 ) , and origin of possible suppression of star formation in compact groups ( e.g. , rasmussen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe our numerical models for ram pressure stripping of galactic halo gas . in  3 , we present the numerical results mainly on the physical properties of remaining halo gas after the ram pressure stripping for variously different models . in  4 ,",
    "we compare the present results with those from other authors and discuss implications of the present results .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "we here do not discuss ram pressure stripping of _ disk gas _ in galaxies in an extensive manner , because a number of authors have already discussed the stripping processes in detail ( e.g. , abadi et al . 1999 ; kronberger et al .",
    "2008 ; marcoline et al .",
    "2003 ; roediger & bruggen 2008 ; tonnesen & bryan 2008 ; vollmer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "in order to simulate the time evolution of galactic halo gas under ram pressure of igm , we use the latest version of grape ( gravity pipe , grape-7 ) which is the special - purpose computer for gravitational dynamics ( sugimoto et al .",
    "we use our original grape - sph code ( bekki & chiba 2006 ) which combines the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) with grape for calculations of three - dimensional self - gravitating fluids in astrophysics .",
    "the original code used in our previous studies is here revised so that both ( i ) ram pressure effects of hot igm on galactic halo gas and ( ii ) hydrodynamical interaction between halo and disk gas can be investigated in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "1 illustrates initial configurations for halo and disk gas in a disk galaxy and hot igm surrounding the disk galaxy in the present numerical study .",
    "since our numerical methods for modeling dynamical evolution of milky way - type disk galaxies have already been described by bekki & shioya ( 1998 ) and by bekki & peng ( 2006 ) , we give only a brief review here .",
    "the total disk mass and the size of a disk of a milky way - type disk galaxy with the total mass of @xmath2 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "henceforth , all masses and lengths are measured in units of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath15 = @xmath16 and @xmath17 = @xmath18 , respectively , where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath13 = 6.0 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath14 = 17.5 kpc as a fiducial value , then @xmath15 = 1.21 @xmath20 @xmath23 km / s and @xmath17 = 1.41 @xmath20 @xmath24 yr , respectively . the disk is composed of a dark matter halo , a stellar disk , a stellar bulge , a gaseous disk , and a gaseous halo .",
    "the mass ratio of the dark matter halo to the stellar disk in a disk model is fixed at 16.7 models ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) suggested from cdm simulations : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the spherical radius , the characteristic density of a dark halo , and the scale length of the halo , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath29 ( 0.6 in our units for @xmath30 = 10 ) is chosen such that the rotation curve of a disk is reasonably consistent with observations .",
    "the mass fraction and the scale length of the stellar bulge represented by the hernquist profile are fixed at 0.17 ( i.e. , 17 % of the stellar disk ) and 0.04 ( i.e. , 20 % ) of the scale length of the stellar disk ) , respectively , which are consistent with those of the bulge model of the galaxy .",
    "the radial ( @xmath31 ) and vertical ( @xmath32 ) density profiles of the disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath33 with scale length @xmath34 = 0.2 and to @xmath35 with scale length @xmath36 = 0.04 in our units , respectively : both stellar and gaseous disks follow this exponential distribution .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity caused by the gravitational field of disk , bulge , and dark halo components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are assigned to the disc component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter @xmath37 = 1.5 .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion at given radius is set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point , as is consistent with the observed trend of the milky way ( e.g. , wielen 1977 ) .",
    "we investigate models with different @xmath2 and adopt the freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ) to determine @xmath38 of a disk galaxy according to its disk mass : @xmath39 structural and kinematical properties of dark matter halos and stellar disks are assumed to be self - similar between models with different @xmath2 .",
    "the gas mass fraction ( @xmath40 ) is assumed to be a free parameter .",
    "an isothermal equation of state is used for the gas with temperatures of @xmath41 k for models with @xmath42 . the initial temperature ( @xmath43 ) of disk gas",
    "is assumed to be scaled to @xmath44 .",
    "the gaseous halo has mass @xmath45 and the same spatial distribution as the dark matter and is assumed to be initially in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the initial gaseous temperature of a halo gas particle is therefore determined by the gas density , total mass , and gravitational potential at the location of the particle via euler s equation for hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , the equation 1e-8 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "therefore gaseous temperature @xmath46 at radius @xmath27 from the center of a disk galaxy can be described as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath19 , and @xmath49 are the proton mass , the gravitational constant , and the boltzmann constant , respectively , and @xmath50 is the total mass within @xmath27 determined by the adopted mass distributions of dark matter and baryonic components in the disk galaxy .",
    "radiative cooling is not included in the present study so that the hydrodynamical equilibrium of halo gas can be obtained in isolated disk models : if gaseous cooling is included in a disk model , the halo gas can rapidly collapse to settle down onto the gas disk so that physical roles of ram pressure stripping in evolution of halo gas can not properly investigated .",
    "the present idealized models thus help us to grasp some essential ingredients of the physical roles of hot igm in evolution of galactic halo gas .",
    "sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the galaxy gaseous halo is highly extended ( @xmath51 kpc ) and low - density ( @xmath52 cm@xmath10 ) .",
    "it is however observationally unclear how far galactic halo gas extends in other galaxies .",
    "we therefore consider that the radius of the galactic halo ( @xmath54 ) is a free parameter .",
    "guided by the above observational results by sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we mainly investigate models with @xmath55 and @xmath56 cm@xmath10 .",
    "the disk galaxy is assumed to be embedded in hot igm with the temperature of @xmath3 and the densities of @xmath4 . in order to avoid huge particle numbers to represent the entire igm in group and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "1999 ) , the igm is represented by sph particles with velocities of @xmath57 in a cube with the size of @xmath58 . the initial velocity of each sph particle for the igm is set to be ( @xmath57 , 0 , 0 ) for all models ( i.e. , the particle flows along the @xmath59-axis to the positive @xmath59 direction ) .",
    "the igm has an uniform distribution within the cube and @xmath58 is set to be @xmath60 for models with @xmath61 .",

    "the spin of the disk galaxy is specified by two angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( in units of degrees ) , where @xmath62 is the angle between the @xmath64-axis and the vector of the angular momentum of the disk , and @xmath63 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath59 axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of the disk onto the @xmath59-@xmath65 plane . in order to show more clearly the ram pressure effects on galactic halo gas",
    ", we mainly investigate the models with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in which the the entire gas disk can strongly feel ram pressure of igm .",
    "we also investigate the models with different @xmath62 and @xmath63 to clarify the roles of halo - disk hydrodynamical interaction in keeping halo gas within disk galaxies .",
    "the mass resolution for disk gas particles , halo ones , and igm in luminous disk models with @xmath68 are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . the typical smoothing length for disk gas particles ( the mean smoothing length at @xmath72 gyr ) in the standard model are 680pc ( this can be as large as 4.7 kpc for halo gas particles owing to the stripped halo gas ) .",
    "although we have investigated 45 models with different @xmath2 , @xmath40 , @xmath57 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 , we mainly show the results of the `` standard '' model with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 km s@xmath12 , @xmath76 kpc@xmath10 , and @xmath77 k. this is mainly because the standard model can clearly show a typical behavior of ram pressure stripping of halo gas from disk galaxies . for a canonical baryonic mass fraction of 0.14 ( @xmath78 ) in the universe",
    ", @xmath4 can be as high as @xmath79 kpc@xmath10 at @xmath80 kpc in a cluster with the nfw profile , the total mass of @xmath81 , and the virial velocity ( @xmath82 ) of @xmath83 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we thus consider that the adopted values of @xmath4 , @xmath57 , and @xmath3 are reasonable for a cluster of galaxies with @xmath84 .",
    "it should be stressed here that the strength of ram pressure ( @xmath85 ) in the standard model is much weaker than that required for ram pressure stripping of disk gas in _ the central regions of clusters _",
    "( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "the adopted galaxy mass in the standard model is referred to as @xmath86 just for convenience .",
    "the total number of particles used for the disk galaxy and the igm in the standard model are 133699 and 125000 , respectively .",
    "the present simulation requires typically @xmath87 cpu hours of the adopted grape-7 systems for each model depending on model parameters : we have adopted the above particle numbers to run numerous models within a reasonable time scale .",
    "we have conducted a resolution test by using a high - resolution model with the total particle number of 333805 and found that there is only @xmath88% difference in @xmath0 between the standard model and the high - resolution one .",
    "we thus consider that the above particle number is enough to discuss ram pressure stripping of halo gas around disk galaxies .",
    "gravitational softening lengths in simulation units ( @xmath14 ) are set to be fixed at 0.018 for the galaxy and 0.2 for the igm .",
    "the range of model parameters investigated in the present study are shown in the table 1 .",
    "we divide models into four categories : `` rich cluster '' model with @xmath89 , `` cluster '' one with @xmath84 , `` group '' one with @xmath90 , and `` small group '' one with @xmath91 .",

    "we mainly investigate the time evolution of gas mass ( @xmath96 ) for halo and disk components in galaxies and the final mass fraction of halo gas stripped from galaxies ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we consider that if sph gas particles at the final time step of a simulation are outside @xmath54 , they are regarded as being stripped by ram pressure of igm . for most models",
    ", halo gas can be rapidly stripped from galaxies within well less than 0.5 gyr .",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath0 at @xmath97 gyr , where the time @xmath98 represents the time that has elapsed since the simulation starts .",
    "we also estimate the accretion rate of gas onto the central 1kpc of a disk galaxy in a simulation by dividing the total gas mass accumulated in the central 1 kpc at the final time step by time that has elapsed since the simulation starts ( i.e. , 0.56 gyr ) .",
    "we confirm that the accretion rates in different models do not depend so much on model parameters in the present study .",
    "fig . 2 shows how halo gas responses to moderately strong ram pressure of igm in the standard model with @xmath84 , @xmath77 k , and @xmath75 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the halo gas is efficiently stripped from the disk galaxy to start to form a gaseous stream behind the galaxy within 0.14 gyr . owing to the presence of the disk gas , halo gas initially located in the inner halo can be accumulated above the disk and thus can not be stripped from the galaxy .",
    "the gaseous stream with many small clumps formed after stripping can finally become less remarkable within 0.56 gyr and most of the remaining halo gas can be located close to the disk .",
    "the final distribution of the halo gas appears to be more compact , flattened , and inhomogeneous at @xmath97 gyr .",
    "the disk gas , on the other hand , can not be stripped efficiently from the galaxy , because it is much more strongly bounded by the disk in comparison with the halo gas .",
    "thus , ram pressure stripping of halo gas is much more effective than that of disk gas .",
    "3 shows that 66% and 6% of initial gas can be stripped from halo and disk , respectively , by ram pressure within 0.56 gyr for the standard model .",
    "4 shows that halo gas initially in the inner halo ( @xmath99 kpc ) is more likely to be still located in the galaxy ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "these remaining halo gas might well be accreted later onto the inner region of the disk to increase slightly the total gas mass of the disk .",
    "the halo gas initially located in the outer halo ( @xmath101 ) can be much more efficiently stripped by ram pressure .",
    "the stripping of the outer halo gas might well severely suppress the accretion of the gas onto the outer part of the galaxy and thus contribute to truncation of star formation there .",
    "4 shows that the radial distribution of the halo gas can dramatically change after hydrodynamical interaction between igm and the halo gas , though that of the disk gas can hardly change owing to ram pressure weaker than the self - gravity of the gas disk .",
    "the distribution of halo gas becomes more compact with the half - mass radius of @xmath102 kpc at @xmath97 gyr , because the stripping can happen much more efficiently in the outer halo , where the halo is more susceptible to ram pressure effect owing to weaker gravity of the galaxy there .",
    "these results in figs . @xmath103 clearly demonstrate that moderately strong ram pressure of igm can very efficiently remove the halo gas , even though it can not remove the disk gas .    in order to understand more clearly how the disk gas in a disk galaxy can promote or suppress the ram pressure stripping of the halo one , we have investigated a comparative model with no disk gas ( `` no disk gas model '' , @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 in the no disk gas model is 0.79 , which is by a factor of 1.2 higher than that ( 0.66 ) in the standard model with disk gas ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the final distribution of the halo gas in the no disk gas model is less flattened and a thin gaseous stream behind the disk can not be seen .",
    "these results mean that hydrodynamical interaction between disk and halo gas can suppress ram pressure stripping of the halo gas .    as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the remaining halo gas at @xmath97 gyr is compressed and accumulated above the gas disk .",
    "about 28% of the remaining halo gas can be located at @xmath105 ( i.e. , left side of the gas disk ) and is likely to be accreted finally onto the disk for further star formation : the low - density gas located at @xmath106 ( i.e. , right side of the disk ) is less likely to be accreted rapidly onto the disk .",
    "therefore , the mass fraction of halo gas that can be used for later star formation ( @xmath107 ) after ram pressure stripping can be significantly smaller than @xmath108 in disk galaxies ( @xmath107 can be typically @xmath109 ) ) .",
    "interestingly , about 0.7% of the halo gas ( corresponding roughly to @xmath110 within @xmath54 ) can be fueled to the central 1kpc of the disk .",
    "this radial transfer of halo gas to the central region of the galaxy can be seen in other models with different model parameters .",
    "these implies that if the centrally accumulated halo gas can be further transfered to the vicinity of the massive black hole ( mbh ) located in the center of the bulge , the halo gas can be used for fueling the mbh with the accretion rate of @xmath111 yr@xmath12 .",
    "these results imply that ram pressure of igm can be responsible for the activation of weak active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the dependences of @xmath0 and final radial distributions of halo gas are described as follows :    \\(i ) galactic halo gas can be efficiently stripped from disk galaxies by ram pressure of igm in groups with @xmath112 , though @xmath0 can be smaller than those in cluster models with @xmath113 .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the group model with @xmath90 shows @xmath114 , which is significantly smaller than that ( 0.66 ) in the cluster model with @xmath84 .",
    "7 clearly shows that the final distribution of halo gas in the group model is less compact and less flattened than that in the cluster model owing to weaker effects of ram pressure of igm in the group model .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath0 depends on @xmath1 in such a way that @xmath0 is higher in models with higher @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the models with @xmath91 ( corresponding to small groups like the local group ) do not show any efficient ram pressure stripping of halo gas .",
    "this result suggests that ram pressure stripping is not so important for galactic global star formation of luminous disk galaxies in small groups with masses of @xmath115 .",
    "\\(iii ) less massive disk galaxies are likely to lose a larger amount of their halo gas more rapidly for a given environment , though the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 is not very strong .",
    "( see fig .",
    "9 clearly shows that even in the group environment with @xmath90 , less massive galaxies can lose larger mass fractions of their halo gas more rapidly .",
    "these results imply that less luminous disk galaxies can truncate more rapidly their star formation after they enter into group and cluster environments .",
    "\\(iv ) for a given @xmath1 , @xmath0 are higher in models with higher @xmath57 owing to stronger force of ram pressure of igm ( see fig . 8) .",
    "also fig.10 shoes that galactic halo gas can be more rapidly stripped from disk galaxies by ram pressure in models with higher @xmath57 .",
    "these results suggest that disk galaxies passing through the inner regions of groups and clusters can truncate their star formation more rapidly owing to more efficient ram pressure stripping of their halo gas .",
    "\\(v ) @xmath0 depends on @xmath4 such that @xmath0 is higher for models with higher @xmath116 ( see fig .",
    "8) , which is a natural result of @xmath117 .",
    "it is found that if @xmath118 kpc@xmath10 and @xmath119 km s@xmath12 in the small group model with @xmath91 and @xmath120 k , then @xmath0 can be as high as 0.65 .",
    "this result suggests that truncation of star formation by ram pressure stripping of halo gas can be possible even in small and/or compact groups , if their igm densities are as high as @xmath79 kpc@xmath10 and member galaxies can have moderately larger velocity dispersion ( @xmath121 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "\\(vi ) @xmath0 does not depend strongly on @xmath40 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath54 .",
    "for example , @xmath0 can differ only by a factor of @xmath122 between models with @xmath123 .",
    "also @xmath0 can differ by a factor of @xmath122 between models with different @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these results imply that initial distributions of halo and disk gas are less important than other parameters ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) in determining @xmath0 .",
    "bekki et al ( 2002 ) first investigated how much amount of galactic halo gas can be stripped by ram pressure in groups and clusters of galaxies based on rather idealized numerical simulations .",
    "they found that ( i ) about 90% of galactic halo gas can be stripped by the combination of tidal and ram pressure stripping in clusters of galaxies , ( ii ) @xmath0 depends on orbits of galaxies in groups and clusters , and ( iii ) galactic halo gas can be effectively removed from galaxies in groups only if the orbits of the galaxies are rather eccentric .",
    "although their results can be useful for better understanding the origin of passive spirals , their models are not sophisticated enough to discuss the dependences of @xmath0 on galaxy environments in a quantitative manner .",
    "recently mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have conducted a thorough parameter study on ram pressure stripping of hot gaseous halos in galaxies for groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "their numerical simulations have shown that typically 70% of the initial halo gas around galaxies can be stripped by ram pressure within 10 gyr in groups and clusters .",
    "although they did not include stellar disks and bulges in their simulations , the result of @xmath0 is broadly consistent with our simulations ( @xmath124 ) , in which cosmologically motivated initial conditions of igm and halo gas are not adopted .",
    "the slight difference in @xmath0 between their and our simulations would be due simply to the fact that they did not include disk gas , which is demonstrated to suppress ram pressure stripping of galactic halo gas in the present study .",
    "mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also have found that @xmath0 is higher in galaxies with smaller masses for a cluster environment with @xmath125 @xmath126 ( i.e. , the models with higher mass ratios show higher @xmath0 in their fig .",
    "this is also consistent qualitatively with our results .",
    "kawata & mulchaey ( 2008 ) have investigated how ram pressure of a groups with @xmath127 influences gaseous components in disk galaxies with maximum circular velocities of @xmath128 km s@xmath12 based on cosmological chemodynamical numerical simulations .",
    "they have found that ram pressure in the group can be more than enough to remove hot halo gas of the galaxies , though it can not remove their cold gas within disks .",
    "these results are consistent qualitatively with the present ones , though initial conditions of disk galaxies in groups are different between kawata & mulchaey ( 2008 ) and the present study .",
    "this consistency implies that ram pressure of igm in groups with @xmath129 can play an important role in controlling gas accretion from halos onto galactic disks and thus determining star formation histories within them .",
    "although broadly consistent results between the present and previous results clearly demonstrate that evolution of hot halo gas around galaxies under ram pressure of igm can be one of key determinants for galaxy evolution , it is not so unclear how global properties of galaxies , in particular , their morphological , structural , and kinematical properties , change after removal of their halo gas .",
    "the present and previous simulations do not enable us to investigate the details of dynamical properties of disk galaxies after ram pressure stripping in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "therefore it is still unclear whether the observed rapid evolution of s0 fraction in groups ( e.g. , wilman et al .",
    "2009 ) can result from truncation of star formation in spirals owing to the removal of halo gas in group environments . given that minor and unequal - mass merging can create s0s ( e.g. , bekki 1998 ) , it is important for our future studies to confirm whether the simulated physical properties of s0s formed from spirals through removal of their halo gas can reproduce the observed ones reasonably well .",
    "the present study has demonstrated that outer halo gas can be preferentially stripped from disk galaxies during hydrodynamical interaction between hot igm and halo gas : the remaining gas around disks mostly originates from inner halos .",
    "this result implies that if halo gas of a galaxy has intrinsic angular momentum to be accreted onto the disk , the preferential removal of the outer gas might well result in the suppression of the growth of the outer disk of the galaxy : the inner disk would grow after ram pressure stripping , though the accretion rate of halo gas would be significantly reduced . our previous work ( bekki et al .",
    "2002 ) showed that after removal of halo gas , stellar velocity dispersions ( thus the @xmath37 parameter ) of a disk galaxy can significantly increase in its outer part owing to dynamical heating of the disk by spiral arms .",
    "the present result combined with our previous one therefore suggests that gradual truncation of star formation can proceed outside - in in disk galaxies owing to more significantly increased @xmath37 and reduced @xmath40 ( i.e. , gas mass fraction ) in their outer disks .",
    "this possible outside - in truncation scenario of star formation can provide a clue to the origin of dusty star - forming regions observed in passive spiral galaxies in distant groups and clusters ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "recent spitzer observations of passive spiral galaxies have shown that passive spirals , which were previously suggested to be `` dead and red '' disk galaxies ( couch et al .",
    "1998 ) , show some levels of star formation ( dressler et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the observed dusty star - forming , optically red spirals mean that star formation activities can be heavily obscured by dust .",
    "it is not clear why passive spirals , which should be gas - poor galaxies to explain the observed red colors ( i.e. , low - level star formation ) , can show heavily observed star - forming regions ( which requires high - density gas and dust ) .",
    "the present outside - in truncation implies that star formation can continue only in the inner high - density regions ( after stripping of halo gas ) , where dust extinction is highly likely to be significant .",
    "thus the outside - in truncation scenario can naturally explain why passive spirals can have dusty - star forming regions without showing star - forming regions not obscured by dust in their outer parts .",
    "typically @xmath130% of halo gas can be accumulated above gas disks during ram pressure stripping and these gas can be strongly compressed and thus strongly interact hydrodynamically with the gas disks ( see the appendix a for the details for the evolution of gas disks during ram pressure stripping ) . as shown in previous numerical simulations ( e.g. , bekki & couch 2003 ; kronberger et al .",
    "2008 ) , external high - pressure of gas may well trigger efficient star formation in gas disks . therefore , the present results imply that before gradual truncation of star formation due to ram pressure stripping of halo gas in disk galaxies , star formation in the galaxies could increase to some extent .",
    "our future more sophisticated simulations including star formation within giant molecular clouds in disk galaxies under ram pressure of igm will enable us to discuss this problem in a more quantitative way .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that metal - rich gas ejected from massive ob stars and supernovae formed during efficient star formation in disk galaxies can be accreted onto the thin disks owing to hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous ejecta and the gaseous halos ( bekki et al .",
    "this physical mechanism of galactic halo gas to keep gaseous ejecta within galaxies can effectively work only if the densities of gaseous halos can be as high as @xmath131 @xmath132 ( bekki et al .",
    "these results combined with the present ones therefore suggest that if galaxies enter inter group and cluster environments and lose most of their halo gas owing to ram pressure stripping of the halo gas , then recycling processes of metal - rich gaseous ejecta in interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies can be dramatically changed owing to gaseous halos with much lower densities .",
    "if recycling processes of metal - enriched ism can be severely suppressed by ram pressure stripping of galactic halo gas , then chemical evolution of disk galaxies after the stripping can be also significantly changed .",
    "for example , energetic stellar winds from supernovae and massive ob stars in luminous disk galaxies under the influence of ram pressure can easily escape from the galaxies and be dispersed into igm of their host environments .",
    "less energetic winds like those from agb stars , on the other hand , can be still trapped within the galaxies so that their ejecta can be used for further star formation and thus for chemical evolution . as a result of these",
    ", abundance patterns might well be significantly different between field disk galaxies , which can retain gaseous ejecta both from agb stars and supernovae well , and cluster / group disk galaxies , which can retain only agb ejecta .",
    "our future quantitative investigation on chemical evolution of disk galaxies after ram pressure stripping of their halo gas will enable us to address this important question as to how abundance patterns in disks are different between field and group / cluster disk galaxies .",
    "we have investigated time evolution of galactic halo gas in disk galaxies under moderately strong ram pressure of igm in different environments based on self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations with variously different model parameters .",
    "we summarize our principle results as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) even moderately strong ram pressure of igm with @xmath133 @xmath134 kpc@xmath10 and @xmath135 km s@xmath12 can strip galactic halo gas efficiently in clusters of galaxies with @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "typically @xmath6% of initial halo gas can be stripped from disk galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) in clusters , which is broadly consistent with results of other studies .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath0 depends on @xmath1 such that it can be higher in environments with higher @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath0 can be as large as 0.4 in group environments with @xmath137 @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath0 in small and compact groups with low igm temperature ( @xmath120 k ) can be as large as @xmath138 , if the groups have igm with @xmath139 @xmath134 kpc@xmath10 and @xmath140 km s@xmath12 .",
    "these results imply that strangulation can happen even in small and/or compact groups with higher velocity dispersions .",
    "\\(3 ) the presence of disk gas in disk galaxies can suppress the ram pressure stripping of their halo gas owing to hydrodynamical interaction between halo and disk gas .",
    "this result suggests that stripping processes of halo gas by ram pressure can be significantly different between late- and early - type galaxies with and without disk gas .",
    "\\(4 ) disk galaxies with lower masses ( @xmath2 ) are likely to show appreciably higher @xmath0 in a given environment .",
    "this result implies that strangulation can proceed more rapidly and more efficiently in disk galaxies with lower @xmath2 .",
    "the remaining halo gas of disk galaxies after ram pressure stripping shows more compact and flattened distributions and has jellyfish - like configurations , irrespective of @xmath2 .",
    "\\(5 ) most halo gas stripped by ram pressure in disk galaxies can originate from the outer parts of the halos so that only halo gas initially in the inner parts can be accreted onto the disks during / after ram pressure stripping .",
    "this suggests that strangulation is more efficient in outer disks and thus that truncation of star formation by stripping of halo gas may well proceed outside - in in disk galaxies .",
    "this outside - in truncation can provide a clue to the origin of red passive spirals in distant groups and clusters .",
    "\\(6 ) ram pressure stripping of galactic halo gas is much more efficient than that of disk gas in groups and clusters and efficiencies of halo and disk gas stripping can be different in different environments with different @xmath1 , @xmath57 , and @xmath4 .",
    "thus the mass ratios of halo gas to disk one in disk galaxies can reflect in what environments they have resided in their histories and thus be significantly different between disk galaxies .",
    "\\(7 ) it is suggested that recycling processes of ism and chemical evolution of galaxies significantly change after removal of galactic halo gas .",
    "one example is that gaseous ejecta from energetic massive ob stars and supernovae can more easily escape from disk galaxies after halo gas stripping owing to much less effective hydrodynamical interaction between gaseous ejecta and halo gas .",
    "abundance patterns of ism in disk galaxies are thus suggested to be significantly different between different environments .",
    "\\(8 ) small fractions of halo gas ( @xmath141% ) in disk galaxies can be accumulated into the central 1 kpc of galactic bulges owing to the compression of halo gas during ram pressure stripping .",
    "these gas can be used for fueling the central mbh and activating weak agn there , though the final dynamical fate of the accumulated halo gas is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "a1 shows the time evolution of morphological properties of the gas disk for the last 0.56 gyr in the standard model .",
    "as the halo gas is compressed by the strong ram pressure of igm , hydrodynamical interaction between disk and halo gas becomes stronger ( @xmath72 gyr ) .",
    "gaseous spiral arms can be developed in the inner region of the disk during ram pressure stripping , though the outer part of the gas disk can lose a minor fraction of its initial gas ( @xmath143 gyr ) .",
