    "the observational picture of the gamma  ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon has constantly been evolving during the last fifteen years since the discovery of the long  lived afterglow radiation in the aftermath of the prompt high  energy emission ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the knowledge of the grb host galaxies as well as of the circumburst environment properties has been providing important clues to characterise the stellar progenitors , to identify key factors such as metallicity ( e.g. , see @xcite for recent reviews ) , especially whenever a possible associated supernova component can not be observed due to distance constraints .    in the _ swift",
    "_ and _ fermi _ era , the phenomenology displayed across the electromagnetic spectrum by grb afterglows appears to be more complex than predicted in the pre_swift _ epoch @xcite . in particular , clear  cut achromatic breaks in the light curves associated with the jet angle have turned out to be unexpectedly rare events @xcite .",
    "likewise , the unexpected paucity of early optical light curves with evidence for reverse shock ( rs ) emission @xcite raised the issue of the magnetic energy density entrained in the ejecta as a possible explanation @xcite in addition to other alternatives ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although in many cases fitting full data sets into a self  consistent description of the afterglow evolution proved very problematic ( e.g. , @xcite ) , overall the afterglow emission can be accounted for as synchrotron with possible inverse compton contributions by the electrons shocked by the grb blast wave ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with occasional energy injection ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or the combination of geometric effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide a self  consistent picture of the broadband data set we collected on grb120404a , spanning from radio to x  rays , within the first few days after the grb itself . to this aim",
    ", we fitted the entire data set using the hydrodynamical code recently developed by @xcite , which models the synchrotron emission from a relativistic fireball sweeping up homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) within a uniform conical structure jet with sharp edge .",
    "the excellent quality of our data set , combined with the observed complex behaviour , represents a rigorous test for the model and offers the opportunity to strictly constrain the energetics , the geometry of the jet , and the microphysics parameters of the shocks .",
    "this is one of the first cases in which a realistic ( i.e. based on realistic hydrodynamical simulations and not purely analytical ) model is applied to a broadband high  quality data set of a grb .",
    "we also present spectroscopic data of the optical afterglow which allowed us to measure its redshift .    throughout the paper ,",
    "times are given relative to the grb trigger time of _",
    "swift_/bat , which corresponds to april 4 , 2012 , 12:51:02  ut . the convention @xmath9 is followed , where @xmath10 is the flux density , the energy index @xmath11 is related to the photon index by @xmath12 .",

    "all of the quoted errors are given at 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath17 ) , unless stated otherwise .",
    "grb120404a was detected and localised in real time with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) instrument @xcite with an accuracy of @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray prompt emission in the 15150  kev energy band lasted about 50  s. a quick - look analysis gave a peak flux of @xmath19  ph  @xmath20  s@xmath14 , a fluence of about @xmath21  erg  @xmath20 , and burst coordinates @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath23 , @xmath24(j2000 ) @xmath25 with an error radius of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) began observing at 130  s and promptly found a bright , uncatalogued x - ray source within the bat error circle .",
    "the x - ray source position was later refined using the xrt ",
    "uvot alignment and matching uvot field sources to the usno - b1 catalogue , with burst coordinates @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath27 , @xmath24(j2000 ) @xmath28 with an error radius of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) began observing at 139  s and from a 147-s exposure in the white filter found an optical candidate with magnitude @xmath30 with coordinates @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath31 , @xmath24(j2000 ) @xmath32 with an error radius of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the uvot optical candidate was soon confirmed independently by the faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) , which began observing 4  minutes after the grb trigger time @xcite .",
    "we measured the redshift of @xmath34 with gemini - north about 1  hour after the burst upon the identification of several absorption lines @xcite ; this value was later confirmed with the x  shooter instrument @xcite at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , which observed at 16  hours post burst @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow was observed by a number of facilities : the ftn and the faulkes telescope south ( fts ) jointly monitored it from 4  minutes to @xmath35  hours with the @xmath36 filters .",
    "the optical light curve exhibited a rebrightening which peaked around 40  minutes post burst with a magnitude of @xmath37 , as also noted by others @xcite .",
    "we kept monitoring the afterglow with the gamma - ray burst optical and near - infrared detector ( grond ; @xcite ) which started simultaneous observations in @xmath38 filters at @xmath39  hours after the burst @xcite .",
    "we also collected data with the @xmath40-m telescope at the aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries ) in nainital , india , starting from @xmath41 hours post grb with @xmath42 filters @xcite .",
    "finally , we discovered the radio counterpart with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ; @xcite ) at 22  ghz at @xmath43  days at the position @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath24(j2000 ) @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) with a flux density of @xmath48jy @xcite .",
    "the galactic reddening along the direction to the grb is @xmath49  mag @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction in each filter has been estimated through the nasa / ipac extragalactic database extinction calculator .",
    "specifically , the extinction in each filter is derived through the parametrisation by @xcite : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60  mag .",
    "we processed the _ swift_/bat data of grb120404a using the latest version of the heasoft package ( v@xmath61 ) .",
    "we extracted the mask - tagged light curve and energy spectra in the 15150 kev energy band by adopting the ground refined coordinates provided by the bat team @xcite .",
    "the bat detector quality map was obtained by processing the closest - in - time enable / disable detector map .",
    "energy calibration was applied using the closest - in - time gain / offset file with the tool batmaskwtevt .",
    "figure  [ f : lc_gamma ] shows the mask - weighted 15150  kev time profile of grb120404a recorded by the _ swift_/bat detector .",
    "it consists of a single fast - rise exponential - decay ( fred ) pulse peaking at 3  s with a @xmath62  s , from @xmath63 to @xmath64  s. the flux shown is derived assuming the rate - to - flux conversion obtained from the time - integrated spectrum over the @xmath65 interval ( see below ) . fitting the time profile with the model by @xcite gives a satisfactory result ( @xmath66 ) , as shown by the dashed line in figure  [ f : lc_gamma ] .",
    "the parameters used are the peak time @xmath67 , the peak flux @xmath68 , the rise and decay times @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the pulse width @xmath71 , and the asymmetry @xmath72 .",
    "their best - fitting values are reported in table  [ tab : n05 ] .",
    "the shape of the pulse with a corresponding decay - to - rise ratio of @xmath73 is very typical of classical _ fast rise exponential decays _ ( freds ) @xcite .",
    "the 15150 kev peak flux is calculated from the spectrum integrated around the peak , from @xmath73 to @xmath74  s ; this can be fitted with a power - law with a photon index of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) with a peak flux of @xmath77  erg  @xmath20  s@xmath14 and a peak photon flux of @xmath78  ph  @xmath20  s@xmath14 . the 15150 kev time - integrated spectrum over the @xmath65 interval",
    "can be fitted with a power law with a photon index of @xmath79 and a total fluence of @xmath80  erg  @xmath20 .",
    "compared with the catalogue of bat @xcite , grb120404a is a medium burst in terms of both peak flux and fluence .",
    "the typical low - energy and high - energy photon indices of grb prompt emission spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the peak energy , @xmath81 , is likely to lie either within or below the 15150  kev energy band ."
