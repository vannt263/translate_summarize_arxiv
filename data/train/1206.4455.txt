    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the narrow energy region above the upper edge is of special interest for spintronics , because spin polarization of blg matrix results in spin splitting of resonances ( figs .",
    "[ fig6]c - f ) . for typical coupling parameter corresponding to the equilibrium distance of impurity from the graphene layer (",
    "assumed value @xmath66 corresponds to co impurity - graphene coupling @xcite ) , the calculated average occupation considerably deviates from @xmath78 i.e. impurity is in mixed valence state for both symmetries ( figs .",
    "[ fig6]c , d , figs . [ fig4]a,[fig5]a ) .",
    "more interesting is the case of a weaker coupling , when the spin polarized kondo state is formed ( figs .",
    "[ fig6]e , f ) . possible reduction of the coupling can be achieved e.g. by chemical engineering ( ligands ) , or introducing ultrathin dielectric film separating impurity from graphene layer , or putting the adatom further from the surface by stm methods @xcite . for fermi level located between the upper edge and nearest higher in energy step in blg density of states the impurity polarization for su(2 )",
    "symmetry is opposite to blg polarization , whereas for @xmath1 has the same sign ( figs .",
    "[ fig4]b,[fig5]b ) .",
    "this tendency is observed both in mv and in kondo states and is in agreement with earlier calculations for regular density of states of the electrodes performed with the use of different techniques @xcite .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that despite the same sign of the spin splitting for both symmetries ( opposite to blg spin splitting ) , the dominance of spin resolved densities of states at the fermi level is different due to significantly different location of unperturbed many - body peaks in @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "interesting observation is a possibility of full spin - polarization of impurity state in the region of full polarization of blg matrix and reverse of magnetic moment when @xmath2 enters the region of full blg spin polarization .",
    "since the fermi level can be shifted by gate voltage this gives the way of electric control of magnetic moment , what is a highly desirable property for spintronics .    in summary , present investigation only signals the interplay of different factors on the many - body physics of magnetic impurity in bilayer graphene doped near the van hove singularity at the bandgap edges .",
    "the exact description of the crossing of the fermi energy with a van hove singularity in the dos would require more sophisticated methods , both in defining the magnetic state of the bilayer going beyond mean field scheme and in discussion of screening processes , where analysis outside sbmfa is required .",
    "in addition to hole - like processes discussed above also electron - like charge fluctuations might play the role in reconstruction of kondo resonance and this topic will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
