    "the first - order duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) formalism @xcite-@xcite describes spin-0 and spin-1 particles and has been used to analyze relativistic interactions of spin-0 and spin-1 hadrons with nuclei as an alternative to their conventional second - order klein - gordon and proca counterparts .",
    "the dkp formalism enjoys a richness of couplings not capable of being expressed in the klein - gordon and proca theories @xcite - vij .",
    "although the formalisms are equivalent in the case of minimally coupled vector interactions @xcite-@xcite , the dkp formalism opens news horizons as far as it allows other kinds of couplings which are not possible in the klein - gordon and proca theories .",
    "nonminimal vector potentials , added by other kinds of lorentz structures , have already been used successfully in a phenomenological context for describing the scattering of mesons by nuclei @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nonminimal vector coupling with a quadratic potential @xcite , with a linear potential kuli , and mixed space and time components with a step potential @xcite-@xcite and a linear potential @xcite-@xcite have been explored in the literature .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive list of references on other sorts of couplings and functional forms for the potential functions . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite it was shown that when the space component of the coupling is stronger than its time component the linear potential , a sort of vector dkp oscillator , can be used as a model for confining bosons .",
    "the schrdinger equation with a quadratic plus inversely quadratic potential , known as singular oscillator , is an exactly solvable problem lan-@xcite which works for constructing solvable models of @xmath0 interacting bodies @xcite-@xcite as well as a basis for perturbative expansions and variational analyses for spiked harmonic oscillators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "generalizations for finite - difference relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite as well as for time - dependent parameters in the nonrelativistic version have also been considered cam-@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to report on the properties of the dkp theory with nonminimal vector linear plus inversely linear potentials for spin-0 and spin-1 bosons in a unified way .",
    "the problem is mapped into an exactly solvable sturm - liouville problem of a schrdinger - like equation .",
    "the effective potential resulting from the mapping has the form of the singular oscillator potential .",
    "the schrdinger equation with quadratic plus inversely quadratic potential is indeed an exactly solvable problem .",
    "nevertheless , only positive coefficients are involved in the well - known solution . because we need solutions involving a repulsive as well as an attractive inverse - square term in the effective potential , the calculation including this generalization with proper boundary conditions at the origin",
    "is presented .",
    "the closed form solution for the bound states is uniquely determined with boundary conditions which emerge as a direct consequence of the equation of motion and the normalization condition , and do not have to be imposed .",
    "it is shown that the spectrum exhibits degeneracy .",
    "it is also shown that the existence of bound - state solutions for vector bosons depends on a too restrictive condition on the potential parameters .",
    "it should be mentioned that a somewhat less general sort of problem , only with the space component of a nonminimal vector potential ( erroneously called pseudoscalar potential ) , has already appeared in the literature cha .",
    "the dkp equation for a free boson is given by @xcite ( with units in which @xmath1)@xmath2where the matrices @xmath3  satisfy the algebra @xmath4 and the metric tensor is @xmath5diag@xmath6 . that algebra generates a set of 126 independent matrices whose irreducible representations are a trivial representation , a five - dimensional representation describing the spin-0 particles and a ten - dimensional representation associated to spin-1 particles .",
    "the second - order klein - gordon and proca equations are obtained when one selects the spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the dkp theory .",
    "a well - known conserved four - current is given by @xmath7@xmath8 where the adjoint spinor @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the time component of this current is not positive definite but it may be interpreted as a charge density . then the normalization condition @xmath12 can be expressed as@xmath13where the plus ( minus ) sign must be used for a positive ( negative ) charge .    with the introduction of nonminimal vector interactions , the dkp equation can be written as@xmath14a_{\\mu } \\right ) \\psi = 0   \\label{dkp2}\\]]where @xmath15 is a projection operator ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) in such a way that @xmath18\\psi $ ] behaves like a vector under a lorentz transformation as does @xmath19 .",
    "once again @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "if the potential is time - independent one can write @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the energy of the boson , in such a way that the time - independent dkp equation becomes@xmath23a_{\\mu } \\right ) \\right ] \\phi = 0   \\label{dkp10}\\]]in this case  @xmath24 does not depend on time , so that the spinor @xmath25 describes a stationary state .",
    "the dkp equation is invariant under the parity operation , i.e. when @xmath26 , if @xmath27 changes sign , whereas @xmath28 remains the same .",
    "this is because the parity operator is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant phase and @xmath31 changes @xmath32 into @xmath33 . because this unitary operator anticommutes with @xmath34 and @xmath35 $ ] , they change sign under a parity transformation , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath37 $ ] , which commute with @xmath38 , remain the same .",
    "since @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the spinor components have definite parities .",
    "the charge - conjugation operation can be accomplished by the transformation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the complex conjugation and @xmath43 is a unitary matrix such that @xmath44 . meanwhile",
    "@xmath43 anticommutes with @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the matrix that satisfies these relations is @xmath46 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 , thus @xmath49 .",
    "note also that @xmath50 , as should be expected for a charge current and the charge - conjugation operation entails no change on @xmath51 .",
    "the invariance of the nonminimal vector potential under charge conjugation means that it does not couple to the charge of the boson . in other words , @xmath51 does not distinguish particles from antiparticles .",
    "hence , whether one considers spin-0 or spin-1 bosons , this sort of interaction can not exhibit klein s paradox .    for the case of spin 0",
    ", we use the representation for the @xmath3matrices given by @xcite@xmath52where@xmath53@xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are 2@xmath573 , 2@xmath572  and 3@xmath573 zero matrices , respectively , while the superscript t designates matrix transposition . here",
    "the projection operator can be written as @xcite @xmath58 . in this case",
    "@xmath15 picks out the first component of the dkp spinor .",
    "the five - component spinor can be written as @xmath59 in such a way that the time - independent dkp equation for a boson constrained to move along the @xmath60-axis , restricting ourselves to potentials depending only on @xmath61 , decomposes into@xmath62@xmath63@xmath64where@xmath65meanwhile , @xmath66    for the case of spin 1 , the @xmath3  matrices are",
    "@xcite@xmath67where @xmath68 are the 3@xmath573 spin-1 matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the 1@xmath573 matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 , while * *  * * @xmath73 and @xmath56 * *  * * designate the 3@xmath743 unit and zero matrices , respectively . in this representation @xmath75 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath15 projects out the four upper components of the dkp spinor . with the spinor written as @xmath76 , and partitioned as@xmath77@xmath78@xmath79@xmath80the one - dimensional time - independent dkp equation",
    "can be expressed as @xmath81@xmath82@xmath83where @xmath84 is equal to @xmath85 or @xmath86 , and@xmath87now the components of the four - current are@xmath88    it is of interest to note that @xmath89 ( in the vector sector ) obeys the same equation obeyed by the first component of the dkp spinor in the scalar sector and , taking account of ( 9 ) and ( 14 ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are square - integrable functions .",
    "given that the interaction potentials satisfy certain conditions , we have a well - defined sturm - liouville problem and hence a natural and definite method for determining the possible discrete or continuous eigenvalues of the system .",
    "we also note that there is only one independent component of the dkp spinor for the spin-0 sector instead of the three required for the spin-1 sector , and that the presence of a space component of the potential might compromise the existence of solutions for spin-1 bosons when compared to the solutions for spin-0 bosons with the very same potentials ( @xmath28 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "this might happen because the solution for this class of problem consists in searching for bounded solutions for two schrdinger equations .",
    "it should not be forgotten , though , that the equations for @xmath93  and @xmath94 are not independent because the energy of the boson , @xmath22 , appears in both equations .",
    "therefore , one has to search for bound - state solutions for @xmath93  and @xmath94 with a common energy .",
    "this amounts to say that the solutions for the spin-1 sector of the dkp theory can be obtained from a restricted class of solutions of the spin-0 sector .",
    "now we are in a position to use the dkp equation with specific forms for vector interactions .",
    "let us focus our attention on potentials in the linear plus inversely linear form , viz . @xmath95where the coupling constants , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are real dimensionless parameters .",
    "our problem is to solve ( [ dkp4 ] ) and ( [ spin1-ti ] ) for @xmath90 ( in the scalar sector ) and @xmath98 ( in the vector sector ) , and to determine the allowed energies .",
    "although the absolute value of @xmath61 in @xmath28 is irrelevant in the effective equations for @xmath90 and @xmath99 , it is there for ensuring the covariance of the dkp theory under parity .",
    "it follows that the dkp spinor will have a definite parity and @xmath100 will be a genuine four - vector . in this case the first equations of ( [ dkp4 ] ) and ( [ spin1-ti ] ) transmutes into@xmath101where @xmath102 is equal to @xmath90 for the scalar sector , and to @xmath91 for the vector sector , with    @xmath103    @xmath104 } { 2 m } \\label{sc2}\\ ] ]    and@xmath105with @xmath106    the set ( [ sc1b])-([sc3 ] ) , with @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 , is precisely the schrdinger equation for the nonrelativistic nonsingular ( singular ) harmonic oscillator . for @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "the effective potential has also a form that would make allowance for bound - state solutions with @xmath112 .",
    "all the remaining possibilities for @xmath113 and @xmath114 make the effective potential either everywhere repulsive or there appears an attractive region about @xmath115 between potential barriers ( @xmath110 and @xmath116 ) which lead to boson tunneling .",
    "it is well known that the singularity at @xmath115 for @xmath117 menaces the boson to collapse to the center @xcite so that the condition @xmath118 ( with @xmath109 ) is required for the formation of bound - state solutions .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to study the bound - state solutions .",
    "since @xmath119 is invariant under reflection through the origin ( @xmath120 ) , eigenfunctions with well - defined parities can be built .",
    "thus , one can concentrate attention on the positive half - line and impose boundary conditions on @xmath102 at @xmath115 and @xmath121 .",
    "continuous eigenfunctions on the whole line with well - defined parities can be constructed by taking symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of @xmath122 .",
    "these new eigenfunctions possess the same eigenenergy , then , in principle , there is a two - fold degeneracy . as @xmath123 , the solution behaves as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a constant and @xmath126 is a solution of the algebraic equation    @xmath127    viz .",
    "@xmath128    where @xmath129 is not necessarily a real quantity .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath130 for a stationary state , as expressed by ( corrente4 ) and ( [ cur2 ] ) , is the same at all points of the @xmath60-axis and vanishes for a bound - state solution ( because @xmath102 vanishes as @xmath131 ) , so we demand that @xmath132 and so @xmath133 .",
    "normalizability of @xmath102 also requires @xmath134 and due to the two - fold possibility of values of @xmath129 for @xmath135 , it seems that the solution of our problem can not be uniquely determined .",
    "this ambiguity can be overcome by a regularization of the potential .",
    "following the steps of ref .",
    "@xcite , we replace @xmath136 by @xmath137  for @xmath138 and after using the continuity conditions for @xmath102 and @xmath139 in the cutoff  we take the limit @xmath140 .",
    "it turns out that the solution with the lesser value of @xmath129 is suppressed relative to that one involving the greater value as @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the minus sign in ( [ 18 ] ) must be ruled out for @xmath141 in such a way that @xmath142 .",
    "hence , @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition ( @xmath145 ) is essential whenever @xmath141 , nevertheless it also develops for @xmath107 when @xmath146 but not for @xmath143 .",
    "the continuity of @xmath102 at the origin excludes the possibility of an odd - parity eigenfunction for @xmath147 , and effects on the even - parity eigenfunction for @xmath148 are due to the continuity of its first derivative .",
    "effects due to the potential on @xmath149 in the neighbourhood of the origin can be evaluated by integrating ( [ sc1b ] ) from @xmath150 to @xmath151 and taking the limit @xmath152 .",
    "the connection formula between @xmath139 at the right and @xmath139 at the left can be summarized as@xmath153so that@xmath154therefore , the eigenfunctions have a first derivative continuous at the origin , except for @xmath155 when the eigenfunction is not differentiable at the origin .",
    "thus , the bound - state solutions for the singular oscillator potential are two - fold degenerate : for a same energy there is an odd - parity solution with a continuous first derivative , and an even - parity solution with a continuous first derivative if @xmath156 or a discontinuous first derivative if @xmath155 .",
    "there is no odd - parity solution for @xmath143 and there develops the homogeneous neumann condition ( @xmath157 ) , and there is no even - parity solution for @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the bound - state solutions for the nonsingular oscillator potential are nondegenerate .",
    "we shall now consider separately two different possibilities for @xmath158 , namely @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "defining@xmath161for @xmath162 , and using the set ( [ sc1b])-([sc3 ] ) , one obtains a special case of whittaker 's differential equation @xcite@xmath163the normalizable asymptotic form of the solution as @xmath164 is @xmath165 with @xmath166 .",
    "notice that this asymptotic behaviour rules out the possibility @xmath167 , as has been pointed out already based on qualitative arguments .",
    "the exact solution can now be written as@xmath168where @xmath169 is a regular solution of the confluent hypergeometric equation ( kummer s equation ) @xcite @xmath170with the definitions@xmath171the general solution of  ( [ 35 ] ) is expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions ( kummer s functions ) @xmath172 ( or @xmath173 ) and @xmath174 ( or @xmath175 ) : @xmath176where @xmath177 is a nonnegative integer . due to the singularity of the second term at @xmath178 , only choosing @xmath179 gives a behavior at the origin which can lead to square - integrable solutions .",
    "furthermore , the requirement of finiteness for @xmath102 at @xmath180 implies that the remaining confluent hypergeometric function ( @xmath181 ) should be a polynomial .",
    "this is because @xmath181 goes as @xmath182 as @xmath183 goes to infinity unless the series breaks off .",
    "this demands that @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is also a nonnegative integer .",
    "this requirement combined with ( [ 36 ] ) implies that the existence of bound - state solutions for pure inversely quadratic potentials ( @xmath186 ) is out of question .      as for @xmath160 ,",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless quantity @xmath187 ,    @xmath188and using ( [ sc1b])-([sc3 ] ) , one obtains the complete form for whittaker 's equation @xcite    @xmath189    the normalizable asymptotic form of the solution as @xmath190 is given by @xmath191 only for @xmath109 ( @xmath192where @xmath193 is a regular solution from @xmath194with@xmath195then , @xmath169 is expressed as @xmath196 and in order to furnish normalizable @xmath102 , the confluent hypergeometric function must be a polynomial .",
    "this demands that @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "note that @xmath199 is proportional to the generalized laguerre polynomial @xmath200 , a polynomial of degree @xmath201 .",
    "the requirement @xmath197 combined with the top line of ( [ 036 ] ) , also implies into quantized effective eigenvalues : @xmath202 in summary , only for @xmath109 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath203 the potentials ( [ sc1a ] ) are able to furnish bound states .",
    "the spectrum is purely discrete and the solution is expressed in an exact closed form .",
    "it is instructive to note that @xmath143 or @xmath146 for the case @xmath107 and the associated laguerre polynomial @xmath204 and @xmath205 are proportional to @xmath206 or @xmath207 , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the solution for the effective nonsingular harmonic oscillator can be succinctly written in the customary form in terms of hermite polynomials : latexmath:[\\[\\varepsilon _ { \\sigma } = \\left ( n_{\\sigma } + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ) |\\omega    @xmath102 proportional to @xmath209    the preceding analyses shows that the effective eigenvalues for the scalar sector are equally spaced with a step given by @xmath210 when the effective potential is singular at the origin .",
    "it is remarkable that the level stepping is independent of the sign and intensity of the parameter responsible for the singularity of the potential .",
    "we also note that the effective spectrum varies continuously with @xmath211 as far as @xmath212 . when the effective potential becomes nonsingular ( @xmath213 ) the step switches abruptly to @xmath214 .",
    "there is a clear phase transition when @xmath215 due the disappearance of the singularity . in the limit as @xmath216 the neumann boundary condition , in addition to the dirichlet boundary condition always present for @xmath217 , comes to the scene",
    "this occurrence permits the appearance of even hermite polynomials and their related eigenvalues , which intercalate among the pre - existent eigenvalues related to odd hermite polynomials .",
    "the appearance of even hermite polynomials makes @xmath218 and this boundary condition is never permitted when the singular potential is present , even though @xmath211 can be small .",
    "you might also understand the lack of such a smooth transition by starting from a nonsingular potential ( @xmath219 ) , when the solution of the problem involves even and odd hermite polynomials , and then turning on the singular potential as a perturbation of the nonsingular potential .",
    "now the perturbative singular potential  by nature demands , if is either attractive or repulsive , that @xmath220 so that it naturally kills the solution involving even hermite polynomials .",
    "furthermore , there is no degeneracy in the spectrum for @xmath219 .",
    "now we move on to match a common energy to the spin-1 boson problem .",
    "the compatibility of the solutions for @xmath221 and @xmath222 demands that the quantum numbers @xmath223 and @xmath224 must satisfy the relation@xmath225for the nonsingular potential , and@xmath226\\]]for the singular potential .",
    "@xmath228 stands for the sign function . for",
    "the nonsingular potential @xmath229 varies from 1 to infinity ( as @xmath230 varies from 0 to 1 ) , whereas for the singular potential @xmath231 and @xmath232 ( the @xmath233 sign corresponding to @xmath234 ) .",
    "these constraints on the nodal structure of @xmath89 and @xmath235 dictate that acceptable solutions only occur for a restricted number of possibilities for the potential parameters and that no solution should be expected for @xmath236 .",
    "more than this , these constraints exclude a few low - lying quantum numbers for a given set of possible solutions for the simple reason that @xmath223 and @xmath224 are nonnegative integers . in conclusion ,",
    "the possible bound - state solutions for spin-1 bosons exist only for a finite set of potential parameters .    to have a better understanding of the spectrum , we plot in figure [ fig1 ] the effective spectrum for the four low - lying levels as a function of @xmath237 , for fixed @xmath238 and @xmath239 . from this figure",
    "we see the phase transition for the spin-0 spectrum at @xmath219 and the severe restriction on the solutions for the spin-1 spectrum .",
    "notice that no bound - state solution for the spin-1 spectrum exists if @xmath211 exceeds @xmath240 and that not all the bound states have a nodeless @xmath241 for the ground state .",
    "we approached the problem of a particle in a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world despite the restriction to the one - dimensional movement .",
    "the motion on axis allow us to explore the physical consequences of the nonminimal vector coupling in a mathematically simpler and more physically transparent way .",
    "there is no angular momentum so that there is no spin - orbit coupling . the more general potential matrix ensuring a conserved four - current can be written in terms of well - defined lorentz structures . for the spin-0 sector",
    "there are two scalar , two vector and two tensor terms @xcite , whereas for the spin-1 sector there are two scalar , two vector , a pseudoscalar , two pseudovector and eight tensor terms @xcite .",
    "there is no pseudoscalar potential in the spin-0 sector of the dkp theory .",
    "in fact , the space component of a nonminimal vector potential is used in ref .",
    "we described spin-0 particles by a five - component spinor , of which only one component is independent instead the two required in ref . @xcite .",
    "also , the number of degrees of freedom described by the ten - component spinor in the spin-1 sector reduces correctly to three . by considering space plus time components of a nonminimal vector potential",
    ", we showed that scalar and vector bosons in the background of one - dimensional linear plus inversely linear potential is mapped into a sturm - liouville problem with an effective singular oscillator .",
    "the existence of solutions for spin-0 bosons requires @xmath242 and @xmath243 . in words ,",
    "the time component of the nonminimal vector potential ( @xmath28 ) alone can not hold bound states , and the presence of the time component in the inversely linear potential lessens the interval of parameters which provides confinement . as for spin-1 bosons , confining solutions requires @xmath244 and when compared to the solutions for spin-0 bosons with the very same potentials ( @xmath28 and @xmath245 ) they can only be obtained from a restricted class of solutions of the spin-0 sector",
    ". it may be salutary to note that , because the differential equation ( [ sc1b ] ) has a singularity at the origin for @xmath141 , one could expect the existence of singular solutions for @xmath102 so that we are not free to suppose that @xmath246 . due to the fact that @xmath102 , whether they are even or odd , disappears at the origin for @xmath141",
