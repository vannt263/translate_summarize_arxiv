    "the calculated width for the skm@xmath58 interaction shows almost the same width as that of experimental data .",
    "this agreement implies that the dominant contribution of the width of isgmr stems from the landau damping and the coupling to the continuum , which are properly taken into account in the present calculations . on the other hand , the coupling to the many - particle many - hole states might have a minor effect on the width of isgmr",
