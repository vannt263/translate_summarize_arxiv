    "the _ minimum degree  @xmath7 _ of a digraph  @xmath0 is the minimum of its minimum outdegree  @xmath8 and its minimum indegree  @xmath9 . when referring to paths and cycles in digraphs we always mean that these are directed without mentioning this explicitly .",
    "a digraph @xmath0 is @xmath3-linked if @xmath10 and if for every sequence @xmath11 of distinct vertices there are disjoint paths @xmath12 in  @xmath0 such that @xmath13 joins  @xmath14 to  @xmath15 .",
    "since this is a very strong and useful property to have in a digraph , the question of course arises how it can be forced by other properties .    in the case of ( undirected ) graphs ,",
    "much progress has been made in this direction .",
    "in particular , linkedness is closely related to connectivity : bollobs and thomason  @xcite showed that every @xmath16-connected graph is @xmath4-linked ( this was recently improved to  @xmath17 by thomas and wollan  @xcite ) .",
    "however , for digraphs the situation is quite different : thomassen  @xcite showed that for all @xmath4 there are strongly @xmath4-connected digraphs which are not even @xmath18-linked .",
    "our first result determines the minimum degree forcing a ( large ) digraph to be @xmath3-linked , which confirms a conjecture of manoussakis  @xcite for large digraphs .",
    "[ thmlinked ] let @xmath19 .",
    "every digraph @xmath0 of order @xmath20 which satisfies @xmath21 is @xmath3-linked .",
    "it is not hard to see that the bound on minimum degree in theorem  [ thmlinked ] is best possible ( see proposition  [ propbestlinked ] ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that for @xmath22 the correct bound is @xmath23",
    ". the cases  @xmath24 of theorem  [ thmlinked ] were proved by heydemann and sotteau  @xcite and manoussakis  @xcite respectively .",
    "manoussakis  @xcite also determined the number of edges which force a digraph to be @xmath3-linked .",
    "a discussion of these and related results can be found in the monograph by bang - jensen and gutin  @xcite .",
    "note that it does not make sense to ask for the minimum outdegree of a digraph  @xmath0 which ensures that  @xmath0 is @xmath3-linked ( or similarly , to ask for the minimum indegree ) .",
    "indeed , the digraph obtained from a complete digraph  @xmath25 of order  @xmath26 by adding a new vertex  @xmath27 which sends an edge to every vertex in  @xmath25 has minimum outdegree @xmath28 but is not even 1-linked .",
    "a slightly weaker notion is that of a @xmath4-ordered digraph : a digraph @xmath0 is _ @xmath4-ordered _ if @xmath29 and if for every sequence @xmath5 of distinct vertices of  @xmath0 there is a cycle which encounters @xmath5 in this order .",
    "it is not hard to see that every @xmath3-linked digraph is also @xmath3-ordered .",
    "conversely , every  @xmath30-ordered digraph  @xmath0 is also @xmath3-linked : if @xmath11 is a sequence of vertices as in the definition of @xmath3-linkedness then a cycle which encounters @xmath31 in this order would yield the paths required for the linking .",
    "the next result says that as far as the minimum degree is concerned it is no harder to guarantee the  @xmath30 paths forming such a cycle than to guarantee just the  @xmath3 paths required for the linking .",
    "in particular , note that theorem  [ thmkordered ] immediately implies theorem  [ thmlinked ] .",
    "[ thmkordered ] let @xmath32 .",
    "every digraph @xmath0 of order @xmath33 which satisfies @xmath34 is @xmath4-ordered .",
    "again , the bound on the minimum degree is best possible ( see proposition  [ propbestordered ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that if @xmath35 then the correct bound is @xmath36 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thmkordered ] yields paths between the @xmath4 ` special ' vertices whose length is at most  6 and it is also easy to translate the proof into an algorithm which finds these paths in polynomial time ( see the remarks after the end of the proof ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the minimum degree in both theorems is not quite the same as in the undirected case : kawarabayashi , kostochka and yu  @xcite proved that the smallest minimum degree which guarantees a graph on @xmath37 vertices to be @xmath3-linked is @xmath38 for large @xmath37 .",
    "( egawa et al .",
    "@xcite independently determined the smallest minimum degree which guarantees the existence of @xmath3 disjoint cycles containing @xmath3 specified independent edges , which is clearly a very similar property . )",
    "kierstead , sarkzy and selkow  @xcite proved that the smallest minimum degree which guarantees a graph on @xmath37 vertices to be @xmath4-ordered is @xmath39 for large @xmath37 .",
    "so in the undirected case the ` @xmath30-ordered ' result does not quite imply the ` @xmath3-linked ' result .",
    "the proofs in  @xcite do not seem to generalize to digraphs .",
    "in a sequel to this paper , we hope to apply theorem  [ thmkordered ] to obtain the following stronger results , which would also generalize the theorem of ghouila - houri  @xcite that any digraph @xmath0 on @xmath37 vertices with @xmath40 contains a hamilton cycle : we aim to apply theorem  [ thmkordered ] to show that if @xmath32 and  @xmath0 is a sufficiently large digraph whose minimum degree is as in theorem  [ thmkordered ] then  @xmath0 is even @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian , i.e.  for every sequence @xmath5 of distinct vertices of  @xmath0 there is a hamilton cycle which encounters @xmath5 in this order .",
    "one can use this to prove that the minimum degree condition in theorem  [ thmlinked ] already implies that the digraph  @xmath0 is hamiltonian @xmath3-linked , i.e.  the paths linking the pairs of vertices span the entire vertex set of  @xmath0 . note",
    "that this in turn would immediately imply that @xmath0 is @xmath3-arc ordered hamiltonian , i.e.  @xmath0 has a hamilton cycle which contains any @xmath3 disjoint edges in a given order .",
    "note that in each case the examples in section  [ extremal ] show that the minimum degree condition would be best possible .",
    "undirected versions of these statements were first obtained by kierstead , sarkzy and selkow  @xcite and egawa et al .",
    "@xcite respectively ( and a common generalization of these in  @xcite ) .    for graphs , the concepts `",
    "@xmath3-linked ' and ` @xmath4-ordered ' were generalized to ` @xmath41-linked ' by jung  @xcite : a graph @xmath42 is _ @xmath41-linked _ if @xmath42 contains a subdivision of @xmath41 with prescribed branch vertices ( so @xmath42 is @xmath4-ordered if and only if it is @xmath43-linked ) .",
    "the minimum degree which forces a graph to be @xmath41-linked for an arbitrary @xmath41 was determined in  @xcite .",
    "clearly , one can ask similar questions also for digraphs .",
    "finally , we believe that the bound on @xmath37 which we require in theorem  [ thmkordered ] ( and thus in theorem  [ thmlinked ] ) can be reduced to one which is linear in @xmath4 .",
    "before we discuss the examples showing that the bounds on the minimum degree in theorems  [ thmlinked ] and  [ thmkordered ] are best possible , we will introduce the basic notation used throughout the paper .",
