    "the gravitational field in general relativity does not admit a local stress - energy tensor .",
    "physically observable quantities like energy and angular momentum therefore are defined only quasi - locally , _",
    "i.e. _ , as integrals over 2-dimensional surfaces in 4-dimensional spacetime . moreover , these quasi - local integrals are completely unambiguous only when spacetime admits a continuous symmetry generated by a killing vector field .",
    "once justified in the presence of symmetry , however , the integrals can also be calculated more generally , provided that one has ( a ) a means of choosing a particular 2-dimensional surface over which to integrate and ( b ) a means of picking a particular vector field on that surface to play the role previously played by the killing field .",
    "the latter issue is particularly troublesome because a typical manifold has no exact symmetries whatsoever . as a result",
    ", several schemes @xcite have appeared in the literature in recent years to define _ approximate _ killing vector fields on manifolds that have no real symmetries .",
    "this paper is concerned with one such scheme , wherein the approximate killing field arises by solving a certain eigenvalue problem on a given riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "more precisely , here we investigate the _ stability _ of this scheme under small perturbations of the geometry .",
    "the question is important because one would expect that any physically reasonable definition of , say , the angular momentum of the gravitational field in a region of spacetime should vary continuously under a continuous deformation of that region , or of the geometry within .",
    "we show below that the approximate killing vector eigenfield depends continuously , in a precise sense , on the geometry used to define it .",
    "this implies that any quasi - local integral based on this approximate killing field varies continuously as well .",
    "the detailed calculations that follow have an unavoidably mathematical tenor .",
    "nonetheless , they are motivated primarily by practical concerns arising in physical applications of the approximate killing field eigenvalue problem .",
    "the main such application is to the problem of calculating the spin of a black hole @xcite .",
    "let us review this application since it is the essential conceptual backdrop for the present results .",
    "the angular momentum of a globally stationary and axisymmetric black - hole spacetime is given by the komar formula @xcite @xmath0 : = \\frac{1}{16 \\pi g } \\oint_s \\star \\ed \\varphi.\\ ] ] the right side here is the integral of the ( spacetime ) hodge dual of the exterior derivative of @xmath1 over a 2-sphere @xmath2 enclosing the black hole . the vector field used to calculate",
    "the komar angular momentum is a _ global _ axial killing field on spacetime . for vacuum spacetimes ,",
    "@xmath3 $ ] is independent of the 2-sphere @xmath2 , and coincides with the total angular momentum of spacetime measured by inertial observers at infinity .",
    "it is natural to identify this angular momentum with the spin of the black hole in this case because the assumed symmetries preclude any gravitational radiation in the intervening space that might contribute additional angular momentum .",
    "the integrals ( [ komar ] ) certainly exist for non - symmetric spacetimes .",
    "but of course they depend one s choices of both @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "these ambiguities can be resolved in certain circumstances , such as if ( i ) one can identify the sphere @xmath2 with a cross - section either of the boundary of a 4-dimensional region @xmath5 of spacetime or of a black hole s horizon , and ( ii ) the _ intrinsic _ geometry on @xmath2 admits an axial killing field @xmath6 .",
    "quasi - local angular momentum _ formulae have been proposed for such circumstances .",
    "naturally , these must reduce to the komar angular momentum ( [ komar ] ) if there exists a global axial symmetry @xmath4 such that @xmath7 on the 2-sphere in question .",
    "( the restriction @xmath8 must then be tangent to @xmath2 . ) if such an extension does not exist , however , then the integrand for a quasi - local angular momentum may differ from that of ( [ komar ] ) .",
    "consider , for example , the _ brown  york angular momentum _",
    "@xmath9 : = -\\oint_{s } { } ^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathcal{t}}\\!\\mathord{\\star}\\ , ( \\xi \\hook \\tau).\\ ] ] the 2-sphere @xmath2 here is a cross - section of a `` tubular , '' time - like , outer boundary @xmath10 of a 4-dimensional region @xmath5 of spacetime .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath11 denotes the 3-dimensional hodge dual within @xmath10 , and @xmath12 involves the extrinsic curvature @xmath13 of @xmath10 within spacetime .",

    "_ generalized angular momentum _",

    "meanwhile , @xmath16 denotes the 3-dimensional hodge dual within @xmath15 , and @xmath17 denotes the extrinsic curvature of @xmath15 as it is embedded in spacetime .",
    "the common feature of ( [ brownyork ] ) and ( [ genj ] ) is that the sphere @xmath2 is fixed geometrically by features of the surrounding spacetime .",
    "both formulae are then on their surest footing when the intrinsic geometry on @xmath2 admits an axial killing field @xmath18 . to continue interpreting ( [ brownyork ] ) or ( [ genj ] ) as _ the _ angular momentum of a black hole when @xmath2 is not axially symmetric",
    ", one must specify how to construct a similarly geometrically preferred vector field @xmath18 from an arbitrary 2-sphere metric .",
    "moreover , this vector field must reduce to the axial killing field whenever one exists . a natural way to do",
    "this is to seek a best approximation , in some prescribed sense , to a killing field on @xmath2 .",
    "several schemes of exactly this type have been proposed @xcite .    in principle , prescribing the two structures ( a ) and ( b ) gives a precise analytic formula for a black hole s angular momentum .",
    "but subtleties can arise in practical applications , such as in numerical relativity .",
    "in particular , the preferred 2-sphere @xmath2 can be expensive to calculate numerically @xcite .",
    "thus , the sphere @xmath2 one actually uses in practice may be displaced slightly , and have a slightly different intrinsic geometry , from the ideal sphere on which the analytic formula is based .",
    "if , in addition , the choice of approximate killing field depends on some _ ad hoc _ choices , such as in @xcite , then one must also worry about how those choices affect the angular momentum .",
    "although the approximate killing field derived from the eigenvalue problem described below does not suffer from the latter ambiguity , it is not immediately clear how important it is to locate the desired @xmath2 exactly in spacetime .",
    "this paper shows explicitly that small errors in the ideal intrinsic geometry on @xmath2 produce only small errors in the approximate killing field determined by the eigenvalue problem described below .",
    "importantly , the quasi - local angular momentum formulae ( [ brownyork ] ) and ( [ genj ] ) both lead to expressions like @xmath19 = \\oint_s \\xi^a[g]\\ , j^b\\ , g_{ab}\\ , \\epsilon.\\ ] ] this is an @xmath20 inner product of an approximate killing field @xmath21 $ ] , constructed ( non - locally ) from the intrinsic geometry @xmath22 of @xmath2 , with a vector field @xmath23 that depends ( locally ) on both the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of @xmath2 .",
    "the change of any such integral under perturbations of the fields involved can be bounded using the schwarz inequality .",

    "we show below that it can .",
    "although our primary motivation is the application to the 2-dimensional geometry of the horizon of a black hole , the results below actually apply to perturbations of a riemannian geometry of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the topology of the manifold , however , must remain compact and without boundary .",
    "one could presumably relax the latter restriction by imposing appropriate boundary conditions , but we will not explore this question in detail .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the eigenvalue problem from @xcite whose solution yields the approximate killing field .",
    "section 3 describes a novel scheme to fix the ( global ) normalization of that vector eigenfield .",
    "section 4 discusses perturbations of the eigenvalue problem , and shows that perturbations in the eigenfields can be bounded if the perturbation of the underlying operator can be bounded appropriately .",
    "section 5 shows that the perturbed operator can indeed be bounded in this way .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with some comments and discussion .",
    "let @xmath24 be a compact riemannian manifold with metric @xmath22 , and let @xmath25 denote an arbitrary vector field on that manifold .",
    "define the action integral @xmath26(\\kappa )           : = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } \\lie_u g_{ab}\\ , \\lie_u g_{cd}\\ , g^{ac}\\ , g^{bd}\\ , \\epsilon              + \\kappa \\biggl ( 1 - \\int_{\\mathcal{m } } u^a\\ , u^b\\ , g_{ab}\\ , \\epsilon \\biggr),\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the volume form on @xmath24 derived from @xmath22 . minimizing this integral",
    "obviously minimizes the lie derivative of the metric in an averaged sense over the whole of @xmath24 , subject to a constraint that the natural @xmath20 norm of the vector field @xmath25 on @xmath24 remains fixed .",
    "this rules out the limit @xmath28 , where clearly ( [ killact ] ) always has a trivial minimum .",
    "the euler  lagrange equation for ( [ killact ] ) is @xmath29 its solutions are vector eigenfields @xmath25 for the _ killing laplacian _ operator @xmath30 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath31 . historically , it appears that this operator was first introduced to the relativity literature by matzner @xcite , and independently to the differential geometry literature by bochner and yano @xcite .",
    "more recently , owen and collaborators @xcite have reintroduced the idea in specific application to the angular momentum of black holes .",
    "the killing laplacian @xmath30 has several important characteristics that dictate the nature of its eigenvalue problem .",
    "first , it is positive and hermitian on the hilbert space @xmath32 of vector fields indicates the tensorial structure of the fields in the hilbert space @xmath32 , and we include @xmath33 explicitly to emphasize that the inner product varies with the metric",
    ". we will drop the latter notation shortly , but keep the former throughout because several hilbert spaces of different types of tensor fields appear in our calculations . ] on @xmath34 that are square integrable with respect to the natural measure defined by @xmath22 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath31 are therefore real and positive , and the corresponding eigenfields @xmath25 are real and orthogonal in the inner product @xmath35 second , the killing laplacian is ( strongly ) elliptic @xcite .",
    "such operators have a _ complete _ basis of _ normalizable _ eigenfields @xmath25 with _ discrete _ eigenvalues @xmath31 that are _ unbounded _ above .",
    "we define the _ approximate killing vector field _ for an arbitrary riemannian geometry @xmath36 to be simply the eigenfield @xmath37 of the killing laplacian with the smallest eigenvalue @xmath38 . if @xmath22 admits an actual killing field @xmath18 , then @xmath37 coincides with it and has eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "but of course the definition is valid generally .",
    "it also may happen that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath40 of @xmath30 is degenerate , and @xmath37 therefore may not be unique .",
    "( this happens , for example , for a round sphere , in which case the lowest eigenvalue is @xmath39 and the corresponding eigenspace is 3-dimensional .",
    "we do not have a similarly concrete example of a geometry with @xmath41 for which the corresponding eigenspace is multi - dimensional , but there is no obvious reason to suppose that such geometries do not exist . )",
    "we will not consider this possibility explicitly below , however , because the generic results for non - degenerate @xmath40 that we do present generalize straightforwardly to this exceptional case .",
    "one of course has to normalize the approximate killing field @xmath37 appropriately in order to calculate a definite spin for a black hole . as for any eigenfield ,",
    "the only freedom is to scale it by a constant over all of @xmath34 .",
    "but it is not immediately clear how to choose that constant scaling .",
    "the normalization for which the constraint term vanishes in the action principle ( [ killact ] ) just fixes the hilbert norm of @xmath25 in @xmath32 .",
    "this is almost certainly not the correct normalization if we are trying to model an axial killing field on a topological 2-sphere .",
    "( it would be a fine normalization for a translational killing field on a torus , say , but this is not the case that interests us most . )",
    "the question therefore arises how to normalize @xmath37 when @xmath42 such that it reduces to the standard normalization for a axial killing field when the sphere s geometry happens to be axially symmetric .",
    "owen and collaborators @xcite outline such a normalization scheme for the case when @xmath37 is constrained to be divergence free on @xmath42 , and is assumed to vanish only at two isolated points .",
    "the orbits of the flow @xmath43 generated by @xmath37 are then all circles , each of which closes for some , though not necessarily the same , value of @xmath44 .",
    "the approximate killing field is normalized such that a certain average of those parameter values @xmath44 at which each orbit closes is @xmath45 .",
    "this reduces to the correct normalization when @xmath46 is a genuine axial killing field , whose orbits all close at @xmath47 by definition .    here",
    "we propose an alternate normalization for the approximate killing field on a topological 2-sphere .",
    "our proposal is ( a ) more local in that it does not require a global average over an entire sphere , ( b ) does not need to restrict to divergence - free vector fields , and ( c ) does not need to assume that @xmath37 has exactly two isolated zeroes .",
    "suppose for the moment that @xmath48 admits an axial killing field @xmath18 .",
    "the defining characteristic of an _ axial _ killing field is that it vanishes at at least one @xmath49 .",
    "the flow @xmath50 generated by @xmath18 has period @xmath47 near any such @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52_{p_0 } = -2.\\ ] ] this is so because the flow near @xmath51 generates a corresponding flow in the tangent space @xmath53 , which is a family of so(2 ) rotations for the _ euclidean _ metric @xmath54 thereon .",
    "this family of so(2 ) rotations closes at @xmath47 if and only if its matrix generator is properly normalized , which is precisely the condition ( [ dxinorm ] ) .",
    "we show in a companion paper @xcite that this convention to normalize @xmath18 at _ one _ fixed point @xmath51 necessarily selects the desired normalization of the killing field throughout .",
    "moreover , this result is independent of which @xmath51 one uses .",
    "it is well known that any vector field , and in particular the approximate killing field @xmath37 for an arbitrary 2-sphere metric @xmath22 , must vanish at at least one @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore can choose the constant scaling of @xmath37 throughout @xmath34 such that @xmath55_{p_0 } = 2\\ ] ] at that one point .",
    "if there is more than one such point , then one may either just pick one , though then the normalization is unlikely to be independent of that choice , or else average the left side of ( [ du0norm ] ) over all such points .",
    "( it may be necessary to assume that there are only finitely many zeroes @xmath49 of @xmath37 , which certainly seems likely for the lowest eigenfields of an elliptic operator .",
    "we have no proof of this , however . )",
    "whichever approach one chooses , the normalization of @xmath37 given by ( [ du0norm ] ) has both of the desired properties that ( a ) it exists for any riemannian 2-sphere geometry , and ( b ) it gives the correct scaling of @xmath46 when that geometry happens to be axially symmetric .",
    "next we want to show that the approximate killing vector eigenvalue problem is _ stable _ , that is , that small changes in @xmath22 induce only small changes in @xmath37 .",
    "we approach this problem technically by considering a smooth , one - parameter family @xmath56 of riemannian geometries on a fixed , compact manifold @xmath34 without boundary .",
    "as @xmath57 varies with @xmath58 , so will any geometric structure derived from it .",
    "the relevant formulae for perturbations of these derived structures are the standard ones from linear perturbation theory in general relativity ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . to summarize our conventions , the levi - civita connection @xmath59 changes according to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an arbitrary fixed ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath58-independent ) covector field , while the inverse metric @xmath62 and the volume element @xmath27 change according to @xmath63 respectively .",
    "we denote perturbations using either the operator @xmath64 , when necessary , or equivalently using a dot accent . using these standard results , the perturbation of the killing laplacian ( [ killlap ] ) takes the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a fixed vector field .",
    "if the vector field is not fixed , such as if it is an eigenfield @xmath67 of the killing laplacian @xmath68 constructed from the metric @xmath57 , then of course there are additional terms coming from the variation of the vector field itself .",
    "the process of relating the perturbation ( [ dkilllap ] ) of the killing laplacian to the perturbations of its eigenfields is more or less the familiar one from elementary quantum mechanics . perturbing the eigenvalue problem ( [ killlap ] ) gives @xmath69 which formally determines @xmath70 up to its component in the eigenspace of @xmath30 containing @xmath70 itself .",
    "one difference from the usual quantum mechanical perturbation theory is that the inner product on the hilbert space @xmath32 varies with @xmath58 , too . imposing the usual normalization condition leads to @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the algebraic operator on @xmath32 derived from the tensor field",
    "@xmath73 this accounts for the changes of the point - wise inner product in the tangent space and the volume element in the hilbert - space inner product ( [ ipl2v ] ) .",
    "collecting these results , and keeping @xmath70 real - valued , gives the formal expression @xmath74 for the perturbation of the @xmath75 eigenfield of the killing laplacian .",
    "the operator in braces in ( [ dunform ] ) is the pseudoinverse of the operator on the left side of ( [ deveq ] ) .",
    "that is , it represents convolution with the green function for the restriction of that operator to the subspace of @xmath32 orthogonal to the eigenspace of @xmath30 with eigenvalue @xmath76 .",
    "we use @xmath77 to denote the projection onto that orthogonal subspace .",
    "the pseudoinverse operator is bounded ( in fact , compact ) , and its operator norm obeys @xmath78 is the gap around @xmath76 in the spectrum of @xmath30 .",
    "( in the case @xmath79 of primary interest , its definition is simply @xmath80 . )",
    "we are relying on general results for elliptic operators on compact manifolds @xcite to show that that spectrum is discrete , and therefore that this bound on the operator norm of the pseudoinverse is meaningful .",
    "the important point , however , is that bounding the perturbation @xmath81 of the eigenfield in hilbert space amounts to bounding the action of the perturbed killing laplacian @xmath82 on the unperturbed @xmath70 .",
    "this section shows that the action @xmath83 of the perturbed killing laplacian on an arbitrary vector field is necessarily bounded as long as both @xmath84 and @xmath85 itself have finite @xmath20 norm .",
    "( this will be the case , for example , if @xmath85 lies in the domain of @xmath30 in hilbert space . )",
    "this implies further that the norm of the perturbation @xmath81 of any eigenfield of the killing laplacian is less than a certain constant @xmath86 times the norm of the unperturbed @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , this @xmath86 scales in direct proportion to the metric perturbation @xmath87 . for",
    "any given @xmath88 , we therefore can make ( the norm of ) @xmath81 as small as we like by taking @xmath87 sufficiently small .",
    "in other words , each eigenfield of the killing laplacian depends _ continuously _ , in the natural @xmath20 topology on hilbert space , on the riemannian metric @xmath22 .",
    "this gives the precise mathematical sense in which the approximate killing field determined by the eigenvalue problem ( [ killlap ] ) is stable .",
    "the following proof of these claims is organized in three steps .",
    "the first is just to use the triangle inequality and certain point - wise bounds on the tensor fields @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 from ( [ dkilllap ] ) to show that @xmath92{{\\dot\\delta_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{k}}}v}_{l^2({\\mathcal{m}}^{{\\bullet } } ) } \\le           c_x\\ , \\norm{\\grad\\grad v}_{l^2({\\mathcal{m}}_{{{\\bullet}}{{\\bullet}}}{}^{{\\bullet } } ) }          + c_y\\ , \\norm{\\grad v}_{l^2({\\mathcal{m}}_{{\\bullet}}{}^{{\\bullet } } ) }          + c_z\\ , \\norm{v}_{l^2({\\mathcal{m}}^{{\\bullet}})}.\\ ] ] the new @xmath20 norms appearing here are just the natural ones for tensor fields with the given index structure under the _ background _",
    "metric @xmath93 , as in ( [ ipl2v ] ) .",
    "( all norms and inner products from this point forward derive from the background metric , which accordingly we no longer denote explicitly . ) the constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on the tensor fields from ( [ dkilllap ] ) , and scale in direct proportion to the metric perturbation @xmath87 .",
    "we derive ( [ dlaptri ] ) in subsection [ dlap < hess ] , including specific values for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    the most divergent term on the right side of ( [ dlaptri ] )",
    "typically will be the first , which involves the ( covariant ) hessian @xmath97 of the vector field .",
    "the second step of our calculation is therefore to bound this hessian such that @xmath98 the second term on the right here denotes the norm of the tensor field @xmath99 , which actually is equal to the hessian @xmath100 if @xmath101 happens to be a killing field .",
    "this provides a nice check on this inequality since the first term on the right vanishes in that case , and one has only some very general bounds on the constants @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the second line .",
    "indeed , those constants arise in much the same way as the corresponding constants in ( [ dlaptri ] ) , though they depend only on the background geometry @xmath22 and not its perturbation @xmath87",
    ". we derive ( [ hesskill ] ) in subsection [ hess < lap ] .",
    "the first two steps of the calculation show that the action of the perturbed killing laplacian @xmath82 on an arbitrary vector field @xmath85 has bounded @xmath20 norm if we can control ( a ) the @xmath20 norm of @xmath84 , and ( b ) the @xmath20 norm of the first - order derivatives @xmath104 .",
    "the third step of the calculation shows that the first - order derivatives can also be bounded in terms of @xmath84 according to @xmath105 where @xmath106 bounds the linear operator @xmath107 on hilbert space derived from the ricci tensor of the background metric .",
    "again , it is independent of the perturbation @xmath87 .",
    "we establish this last result in subsection [ grad < lap ] .    at this stage",
    "we ( will ) have shown that , although the perturbed killing laplacian @xmath82 is certainly an unbounded operator on hilbert space , the `` unbounded part '' of its action on any given vector field @xmath85 is _ relatively _ bounded by the action @xmath84 of the killing laplacian itself .",
    "( one could insert some technical language at this point regarding the domains of these operators , but in fact this argument shows that it is natural simply to choose the domain of @xmath82 to coincide with that of @xmath30 . ) the action @xmath108 of the killing laplacian on any of its own eigenfields is certainly bounded .",
    "we therefore conclude from ( [ dunform ] ) that the perturbation @xmath81 of any eigenfield of @xmath30 satisfies @xmath109 for a constant @xmath86 depending on the unperturbed eigenvalue @xmath76 , the unperturbed spectral gap @xmath110 around that eigenvalue , and a number of constants @xmath111 like those described above depending on @xmath22 and @xmath87 , but not on @xmath88 .",
    "we establish this result in detail in subsection [ dlap < lap ] , where we give a specific formula for the @xmath86 .",

    "the next step is more or less the same for each of the three terms in ( [ dltri ] ) .",
    "let s consider the first in detail , which is @xmath119 the operator @xmath120 is obviously non - negative .",
    "it is also bounded because @xmath34 is compact by assumption and both @xmath113 and @xmath121 act algebraically . to see this , note that the tensor field underlying @xmath121 is just the point - wise adjoint of that underlying @xmath113 itself : @xmath122 we use uppercase indices in the latter expression to denote `` vectors '' in the appropriate tensor product of tangent and co - tangent spaces at each point of @xmath34 .",
    "the product @xmath123 at each @xmath124 is then a non - negative , hermitian map from that tensor product space to itself .",
    "in fact , each of these maps must have a substantial kernel because @xmath125 itself maps each eigenvector of @xmath126 to an eigenvector of @xmath127 having the same eigenvalue , and conversely @xmath128 maps eigenvectors in the opposite direction .",
    "it follows that each @xmath126 has at most as many non - zero eigenvalues as the dimension of @xmath34 , and each of these is also an eigenvalue of @xmath127 at the same point .",
    "define @xmath129 to be the largest such eigenvalue at each @xmath124 .",
    "this function must be smooth since the tensor fields used to define it are smooth .",
    "it therefore attains a finite maximum value on the compact manifold @xmath34 .",
    "this `` maximum maximum '' eigenvalue bounds the hilbert space operator @xmath120 such that @xmath130 we have shown that the bounding constant @xmath94 here is given by @xmath131(p )              \\notag\\\\[1ex ]          \\le { } & { } \\max_{p \\in { \\mathcal{m } } } \\bigl [ x^{abc}{}_d\\ , x_{abc}{}^d \\bigr](p ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the metric to raise and lower indices and the inner maximum on the first line is over the unit sphere @xmath132 in each tangent space @xmath133 .",
    "the final inequality arises because the largest eigenvalue at each point is less than the sum of all the ( non - negative ) eigenvalues , which of course is just the trace of the operator .",
    "this trace might be simpler to calculate and maximize over @xmath34 in practice .",
    "we can bound the other two terms on the right side of ( [ dltri ] ) in a completely analogous manner .",
    "the overall bound ( [ dlaptri ] ) then follows directly .",
    "note that the tensor fields @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 from ( [ dkilllap ] ) are all linear in the perturbation @xmath87 of the metric .",
    "it follows that the bounding constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in ( [ dlaptri ] ) all scale homogeneously under a reparameterization of the family of geometries @xmath57 underlying the perturbation .",
    "the left side of ( [ dlaptri ] ) scales in the same manner , of course , so the result holds regardless of how the parameter @xmath58 is defined geometrically .",

    "the grouping of indices is important for calculating the `` maximum maximum '' eigenvalue of each tensor field as on the first line ( [ cxdef ] ) , but not for merely calculating the trace on the second line .",
    "we conclude this detailed discussion with three comments .    first , the constants @xmath86 from ( [ cn ] ) are homogeneous of degree one in the metric perturbation @xmath87 ( and its derivatives ) .",
    "note that @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 from ( [ dkilllap ] ) , as well as @xmath165 from ( [ alphadot ] ) , scale proportionately under a ( constant ) rescaling of @xmath87 .",
    "the other `` @xmath111 '' constants appearing in ( [ cn ] ) derive solely from the background geometry @xmath22 .",
    "second , the constants @xmath86 from ( [ cn ] ) vary with @xmath88 , and increase like @xmath166 for large @xmath88 .",
    "one expects the eigenvalue gap @xmath110 to increase with @xmath88 , but not as rapidly as @xmath76 itself .",
    "thus , for example , the fractional perturbations in the eigenvalues themselves , @xmath167{u_n}{{\\dot\\delta_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{k}}}u_n}}{\\kappa_n\\ , \\norm{u_n}^2 }           \\le \\frac{c_n}{\\kappa_n},\\ ] ] vanish for asymptotically large @xmath88 .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath86 themselves diverge in that limit . therefore , while each eigenfield @xmath70 varies continuously with @xmath22 in the sense of ( [ unbound ] ) , the _ set _ of eigenfields is not _",
    "uniformly _ continuous in @xmath22 .",
    "this may raise some technical difficulties in certain applications , but our objective here is just to bound the variations only of the lowest eigenfield @xmath37 .",
    "thus , what matters here is just the one constant @xmath168 , and the subtlety regarding uniform continuity is irrelevant .",
    "third , we have shown that @xmath37 varies continuously with @xmath22 in a loose sense , but have not stated clearly the topology on the space of metrics for which this continuity holds strictly .",

    "rather , the constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath169 in ( [ cn ] ) arise by maximizing quantities over all of @xmath34 as in ( [ cxdef ] ) . the appropriate topology on the space of metrics",
    "should therefore be based on a supremum , or @xmath170-type , norm of @xmath87 .",
    "it should also have a sobolev - type character , depending not only on @xmath87 but also on its first two derivatives .",

    "( for example , it might derive from the total volume of @xmath34 in the background geometry . )",
    "conversely , we have established @xmath20-type bounds on the perturbations @xmath81 , but not @xmath170-type ( _ i.e. _ , supremum ) bounds .",
    "the latter are irrelevant , however , for calculating perturbations in quasi - local invariants like ( [ brownyork ] ) or ( [ genj ] ) .",
    "this paper considers a family of smooth metrics @xmath57 depending smoothly on a real parameter @xmath58 .",
    "each metric defines a killing laplacian @xmath68 , which admits a complete basis of eigenfields @xmath173 in the hilbert space @xmath32 of vector fields on a compact manifold @xmath34 .",
    "( the _ topology _ of this hilbert space , though of course not its inner product , is independent of the smooth metric @xmath34 on the compact manifold @xmath34 . ) we have shown that each eigenfield @xmath67 varies continuously with @xmath22 in the @xmath20 sense of ( [ unbound ] ) , where the size of a metric perturbation is measured in the @xmath174 sense of ( [ snorm ] ) .",
    "in particular , the lowest - order eigenfield @xmath37 , which is a natural candidate to define an approximate killing field on a manifold with no genuine symmetries , depends continuously on the metric .",
    "the natural application of this result is to the problem of measuring the angular momentum of a black hole in general relativity .",
    "the manifold @xmath34 is a topological 2-sphere in this case , and the metric @xmath22 on it is arbitrary .",
    "the result is useful because in practical applications , say in numerical relativity , the actual horizon may be difficult or expensive to locate exactly .",
    "standard horizon - finding schemes @xcite help to locate the horizon approximately , and the continuous dependence of the approximate killing eigenfield @xmath37 on the metric implies that the corresponding quasi - local angular momentum of the approximate horizon will approximate that of the actual horizon .",
    "this conclusion is not unexpected , of course , but it is useful to establish a solid theoretical basis for the claim .",
    "similarly , the general continuity result we have established can be used to bound the growth of the angular momentum of a black hole under dynamic evolution .",
    "this could be useful , for example , in the study of absorption processes involving dynamical horizons @xcite at or near extremality .",
    "finally , in each of these applications we have proposed in ( [ du0norm ] ) a novel , and purely local means of normalizing the approximate killing field on a topological 2-sphere .",
