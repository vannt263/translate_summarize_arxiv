    "the problem of understanding the formation and the evolution of the milky way is fundamental to improve the knowledge of the formation of spiral galaxies in general .",
    "an important constraint is represented by the abundance gradients along the thin disk of the milky way .",
    "abundance gradients are a feature commonly observed in many spiral galaxies and show that the abundances of metals are decreasing outward from the galactic centers . a good agreement between model predictions and observed properties of the galaxy",
    "is generally obtained by models that assume that the disk was formed by the infall of gas ( e.g chiosi , 1980 ; matteucci & franois ( 1989 ) ; chiappini et al .",

    "2010 among others ) .    in most of those papers",
    "the formation timescale of the thin disk was assumed to be a function of the galactocentric distance , leading to an inside - out scenario for the galaxy disk build - up .",
    "this assumption helps in reproducing the abundance gradients along the disk . in those papers the parameter space of the chemical evolution models",
    "was analyzed considering different infall and star formation rate ( sfr ) laws to reproduce the observed abundance gradients .",
    "cescutti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the results obtained using a chemical evolution model with a two - infall law and inside - out formation are in very good agreement with the collection of data by andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2002a , b , c , 2004 ) and luck et al .",
    "( 2003 ) on cepheids in the galactocentric distance range 5 - 17 kpc for many of the studied elements .",
    "colavitti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that it is impossible to fit all the disk constraints at the same time without assuming an inside - out formation for the galactic disk together with a threshold in the gas density for the sfr .",
    "in particular , the inside - out formation is important to reproduce the slope of the abundance gradients in the inner disk , whereas the threshold gas density is important to reproduce present - day gradients in the outer disk .",
    "recently , pilkington & al .",
    "( 2012 ) , by means of pure chemical models and cosmological simulations including chemistry , have supported the conclusion that spiral disks form inside - out .    however ,",
    "if gas infall is important , the galactic disk is not adequately described by a simple multi - zone model with separated zones ( mayor & vigroux 1981 ) . to maintain consistency ,",
    "radial gas flows have to be taken into account as a dynamical consequence of infall .",
    "the infalling gas has a lower angular momentum than the circular motions in the disk , and mixing with the gas in the disk induces a net radial inflow .",
    "lacey & fall ( 1985 ) estimated that the gas inflow velocity is up to a few km s@xmath1 , and at 10 kpc is v@xmath2 1 kms@xmath1 .",
    "goetz & kppen ( 1992 ) studied numerical and analytical models including radial flows .",
    "they concluded that radial flows alone can not explain the abundance gradients but are an efficient process to amplify the existing ones .",
    "portinari & chiosi ( 2000 ) implemented the radial flows of gas in a detailed chemical evolution model characterized by a single infall episode .",
    "recently , spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) , and spitoni et al . (",
    "2013 ) have taken into account inflows of gas in detailed one - infall models(treating only the evolution of the disk independently from the halo and thick disk ) for the mw and m31 , respectively .",
    "spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) tested also the radial flows in a two - infall model but only for the oxygen .",
    "it was found that the observed gradient of oxygen can be reproduced if the gas inflow velocity increases in modulus with the galactocentric distance , in both the one - infall and two - infall models . in contrast to the previous papers , where the velocity patterns of the inflow were chosen to produce a `` best fit '' model , bilitewski & schnrich ( 2012 ) presented a chemical evolution model where the flow of gas is directly linked to physical proprieties of the galaxy like the angular momentum budget .",
    "the resulting velocity patterns of the flows of gas are time dependent and show a non linear trend , always decreasing with decreasing galactocentric distance . at a fixed galactocentric distance the velocity flows decrease in time .",
    "the abundance gradient evolution in time has been studied in several works in the past , and in the literature , various predictions have been made about the time evolution of metallicity gradients in chemical evolution models : chiappini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) predicted a steepening with time whereas other authors predicted an initially negative gradient that then flattens in time ( molla & diaz 2005 , prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy between different models is that chemical evolution is very sensitive to the prescriptions of the detailed physical processes that lead to the enrichment of inner and outer disks , and the flattening or steepening of gradients in time depends on the interplay between infall rate and sfr along the disk and also , as discussed above , on the presence of a threshold in the gas density for the star formation .",
    "different recipes of star formation or gas accretion mechanisms can provide different abundance gradients predictions .",
    "> from the observational point of view there have been some studies trying to infer the temporal evolution of gradients from planetary nebulae ( pne ) of different ages ( maciel & costa , 2009 ; maciel & al .",
    "2013 ) but no firm conclusion could be derived .",
    "the first observational papers which could clarify the issue of the temporal evolution of gradients and consequently the formation of galactic disks , are from cresci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , jones et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , contini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and yuan et al .",
    "in particular , cresci & al .",
    "( 2010 ) have found an inversion of the o gradient at redshift z=3 in some lyman - break galaxies : they showed that the o abundance decreases going toward the galactic center , thus producing a positive gradient .",
    "this gradient inversion was already noted by chiappini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for oxygen , and curir et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have adopted this gradient inversion to study the rotation - metallicity correlation in the thick disk found by spagna et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and interpreted this correlation as the fossil of this inverted gradient at early times .",
    "in this paper we focus on the study of the abundance gradients in the milky way and their evolution with cosmic time with the aim of understanding how different physical processes can influence the formation and evolution of gradients in spiral galaxies in general , since our galaxy can be considered as a typical spiral galaxy . in particular , we will follow the evolution in time of the gradients of the following elements : fe , o , c , ne , and s. we will start from an updated version of the two - infall model of chiappini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and then we will examine the processes which mainly influence the formation of abundance gradients : i ) a differential infall law leading to an inside - out formation of the disk , ii ) a threshold in the gas density in the star formation process , iii ) a variable star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and iv ) radial gas flows and their velocity pattern .",
    "we will finally focus our attention on the evolution of the abundance gradients especially at high redshift in order to test whether an inversion of the gradients , as measured by cresci & al . (",
    "2010 ) in high redshift disk galaxies , should be expected for the studied chemical elements and how it can be interpreted .",
    "no chemical evolution models , with the exception of the two infall model of chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , can predict such gradient inversion .",
    "the novelty here is that we test whether this inversion is preserved in the presence of radial flows either with speed flow constant or variable in time .",

    "2 we describe the chemical evolution model used in this work , in sect .",
    "3 we report the nucleosynthesis prescriptions , in sect .",
    "4 we present the implementation of the radial inflow of gas in the chemical model , and in sect .",
    "5 observational data are shown . in sect .",
    "6 we report and discuss our model results concerning the present day gradients and the ones at high redshift . finally we draw the main conclusions in sect . 7 .",
    "the two - infall model considered here is an updated version of the chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 2001 ) model .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to have formed by means of two main infall episodes : the first formed the halo and the thick disk , the second the thin disk .",
    "the time - scale for the formation of the halo - thick disk is 0.8 gyr and the entire formation period does not last more than 2 gyr .",
    "the time - scale for the thin disk is much longer , 7 gyr in the solar vicinity , implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes mainly from the intergalactic medium and not only from the halo .",
    "moreover , the formation timescale of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of the galactocentric distance , leading to an inside out scenario for the galaxy disk build - up ( matteucci & franois 1989 ) . the galactic thin disk is approximated by several independent rings , 2 kpc wide , without exchange of matter between them .",
    "the main characteristic of the two - infall model is an almost independent evolution between the halo and the thin disk ( see also pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 ) .",

    "[ parametri14ossigeno ] and [ parametri14ferro ] it is clear that without a threshold in the standard static model ( model s - c ) , even if an inside - out formation is considered , the gradient is too flat between 6 - 12 kpc and in the outer parts of the disk it even increases , clearly at variance with the observational data . the reason why the threshold steepens the gradient in the outermost regions is because every time the gas density goes below the critical value ( and it is easier to happen in the outer regions ) , the star formation stops and starts again only when the gas has gone over the threshold thanks to gas infalling and/or restored by dying stars .",
    "actually , at distances larger than 15 - 16 kpc the gas density is almost always below the assumed threshold so the abundances are very low , due to the frequent suppression of star formation .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the majority of previous works , only the o gradient was discussed in relation to radial flows .",
    "however , in spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) it was shown that for a model with just one infall , aimed at studying just the disk and not the whole galaxy as the two - infall model , a linear law for the gas flow velocity could reproduce both the o and fe gradient at the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "also in bilitewski & schnrich ( 2012 ) , who included radial gas flows in their model , a flat gradient in the central disk region was found for the iron in some of their models .",
    "the explanation of this behavior can be found in the combination of several processes :    * different timescales of production of chemical elements ( oxygen is produced on short time scales whereas iron on long ones ) ; * the two - infall assumption for the gas accretion , in particular the assumed total surface mass density distribution for the halo ; * the inflow velocity pattern considered .    in particular , it seems that the flattening of the fe gradient in the central disk regions could be due to a combination of variable velocity for the flow and long timescales for the fe production from type ia supernovae . to test our hypothesis , we computed the gradients of other elements , as shown in fig .",

    "having said that , the problem remains that model r - a does not fit the present day fe gradient .",
    "this is clearly a peculiarity of the two - infall model since spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) could fit both fe and o gradients at the same time with a simple linear velocity pattern in the framework of the one - infall model .",

    "we have then finally tested a model with a total surface mass density in the halo becoming very small for distances @xmath107 10 kpc ( model r - d ) , a more realistic situation than that in model r - a , and yet a different velocity pattern ( iii ) . in this case",

    "( 2010 ) , there are lyman - break galaxies showing evidence for disk",
    ". however these galaxies might be large objects than the milky way and this could be the reason for our gradients being smaller .",
    "our explanation for the gradient inversion in the milky way is based on the inside - out disk formation :    * at early epoch ( t=2 gyr from the big bang , z = 3 ) the efficiency of chemical enrichment ( i.e. of the sfr ) , in the inner regions is high but the rate of infalling primordial gas is dominating , thus diluting the gas more in the inner regions than in the outer ones ; * as time passes by , the infall of pristine gas in the inner parts decreases and the chemical enrichment takes over ; * then , at later epochs , the sfr in the inner regions is still much higher than in the outer parts of the disk where the gas density is very low , but the infall is lower and the abundance gradients assume the shape seen in the observational data .    since we assumed a flow velocity constant in time we checked the robustness of our results for the ( r - d ) model concerning the inversion of gradient at redshift z=3 , considering a time - dependent velocity pattern consistent with the present time pattern iii introduced in fig . 4 , and with the work of bilitewski & schnrich ( 2012 ) .",
    "we assume for this test the extreme case where the pattern iii is the present day law , and we look for the pattern at times @xmath132 gyr which could end up as pattern iii . in fig .",
    "3 of bilitewski & schnrich ( 2012 ) , time dependent velocity patterns at times @xmath133 3 gyr , 6 gyr , 9 gyr , and 12 gyr are presented .",
    "we find that the radial velocity pattern at 3 gyr is related to the one at 12 gyr by the following expression : @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , for the model ( r - d ) we assume that the pattern at the early times up to 2 gyr follows this equation : @xmath135 in fig .",
    "18 , we labeled this velocity profile as `` pattern v '' . in fig .",
    "19 we show the abundance gradient for the oxygen at t=2 gyr using this new velocity pattern , and we can see that the inversion of the gradient is preserved .",
    "we consider this a robust test .    on the other hand ,",
    "a full treatment of a time dependent velocity pattern is not the aim of this paper and it will be discussed in a future work .",
    "the last test was to check a smaller velocity of the flow at 2 gyr ( pattern iv in fig .",
    "18 ) . in fig .",
    "19 we can see that also in this case a gradient inversion is present .",
    "we have computed the chemical evolution of the milky way with particular attention to the formation and evolution of the abundance gradients .",
    "we have tested the effects of several physical processes which can influence the formation of gradients , and studied the temporal evolution of gradients .",
    "in particular , we have tested whether the gradient inversion of redshift z=3 is preserved in the presence of radial gas flows , and this is the main novelty of the paper .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * if we do not assume an inside - out formation for the thin disk ( @xmath89 constant ) , the present day abundance gradients provided by the model are too flat in the inner part of the disk and the observations are not reproduced ( model s - e ) .",

    "* we found that the assumed velocity pattern for radial gas flows is a crucial parameter in shaping the chemical evolution of the disk and in particular the abundance gradients and their evolution . * all the chemical evolution models presented here show a steepening of the gradient in time , mostly in the inner regions .",
    "* at z=3 a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the thin disk is predicted for most of our chemical evolution models , including the best one . with",
    "a time dependent velocity radial inflow , the inversion of the abundance gradient at early times is preserved .",

    "the only model with inside - out that does not predict the gradient inversion at high redshift is that with variable sfe ( model s - b ) . in this model",
    "the gradient at z = 3 is negative as the present day one .",
    "if the gradient inversion will be confirmed , we can conclude that a variable the sfe , which contrasts the effect of the infall at early times , is unlikely .",
    "* finally , a word of caution is necessary relative to the observed gradient inversion at high z ; yuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the measured metallicity gradient changes systematically with angular resolution and annular binning .",
    "seeing - limited observations produce significantly flatter gradients than higher angular resolution observations .",
    "for these reasons , more observations are needed in the future to confirm cresci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) high redshift positive inner gradients .",
    "it is worth , before concluding , to discuss how robust are the above conclusions .",
    "we run several models changing the main assumptions which are : inside - out formation of the disk , efficiency of star formation , radial flows and their speed , threshold gas density for star formation and distribution of the total surface mass density of the galactic halo .",
    "the inside - out formation scenario is a well tested assumption suggested by the majority of papers concerning the galactic disk ( e.g. pilkington et al .",
    "2012 ) and also by observations at high redshift ( e. g. mateo - munoz et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we conclude that the inside - out formation is necessary to reproduce the abundance gradients but also to obtain a gradient inversion at high redshift and this is a robust conclusion .",
    "in fact , even changing all the other physical processes , with the exception of a variable star formation efficiency with galactocentric distance , a model with inside - out always predict such an inversion .    on the other hand ,",
    "other assumptions are probably still debatable , such as the halo total surface mass density distribution .",
    "this might appear like a quantity which should not influence abundance gradients in the disk .",
    "instead , this quantity has a noticeable influence on the disk gradients at large galactocentric distances .",
    "in fact , at such distances the total surface mass density of the disk is negligible and that of the halo might predominates .",
    "this fact was already discussed in chiappini et al .",
    "we find that both the o and fe gradient at the present time in the disk can be well reproduced if the halo total surface mass density distribution is a strong decreasing function of the galactocentric radius , but we can not say if this is an unique solution .    a variable efficiency of star formation with radius can be certainly ruled out if the gradient inversion will be confirmed and this is also a robust result .",
    "on the other hand , the presence or absence of a gas density threshold can not be firmly established on the basis of our models , although in the presence of radial flows we obtain better results without a threshold .",
