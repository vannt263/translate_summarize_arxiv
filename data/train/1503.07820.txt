    "the fundamental dust - plasma interaction , which is also essential to understand the collective behavior in a dusty plasma , includes ( 1 ) charging of the dust by absorption of plasma particles so it becomes subject to the electric field ( @xmath0 ) via the electrical force @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the dust charge ) ; ( 2 ) heating of the dust via the collection of plasma electron and ion energy fluxes so the dust particulate can melt , evaporate , or simply sublimate ; ( 3 ) dragging of the dust via a frictional force enhanced by the coulomb interaction with the flowing background plasma .    to understand the dust dynamics and its change of state",
    ", one must resort to a dust charging theory .",
    "the most - widely used of such is the orbital - motion - limited ( oml ) theory , which dates back to the work of mott - smith and langmuir  @xcite . in the 1960s ,",
    "alpert et al  @xcite and laframboise  @xcite completed the current formulation .",
    "the oml theory is known to predict accurately the dust potential for a small  @xcite and not so small dust grain  @xcite , despite its simplifying assumption on collisionless ion orbit that misses the absorption radius effect away from the dust surface  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the existing formulation can not be used for predicting the plasma response , namely solving the plasma potential @xmath3 , as shown in allen et al  @xcite . as the result , oml theory to date can not predict the fundamental quantity of dust charge . in practice ,",
    "one has been using an idealized dust charge - potential relationship due to whipple  @xcite , who computed the dust capacitance using the conventional debye shielding potential that does not take into account the constraint of angular momentum conservation in setting the plasma density near the dust surface .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a revised oml formulation that , for the first time , is able to predict the plasma response and hence the dust charge .",
    "the oml predictions will then be contrasted with the whipple approximation to elucidate the missing physics in dust charging for a spherical dust of comparable size with the debye length , which is of special importance to dust transport / survivability in tokamaks  @xcite .",
    "this new oml formulation is also important for electron - emitting dust particulates as it provides the basis for extending the oml theory to positively charged dust  @xcite .    as an approximation of the orbital motion ( om ) theory which follows the collisionless particle orbit via conservation of energy and angular momentum ,",
    "the oml theory will inevitably introduce discrepancies in the evaluation of dust current / heat collection , and in the plasma ion density evaluation .",
    "the former will give rise to a discrepancy in dust potential , while the latter in plasma potential and hence dust charge , in comparison with those predicted by the om theory .",
    "the usefulness of the oml formulation is due to its simplicity , and the relatively high accuracy for a variety of applications where the dust size is not large compared with the plasma debye length .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "oml ] , we briefly recall the key components of the oml theory and its inability to predict dust charge in its current formulation . a corrected formulation on the oml ion density is shown in section  [ sec : corrected - oml ] , which completes the oml formulation for calculating both dust potential and dust change . in section",
    "[ sec : oml - result ] , we apply the new oml model to evaluate the plasma response and the dust charge , and contrast the results with the widely used whipple approximation . the findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "there are three essential ideas underlying oml theory .",
    "first , the collection of plasma electrons and ions by the dust is governed by their collisionless orbit .",
    "these are subject to two conservation laws : energy [ @xmath4 conservation and angular momentum ( @xmath5 ) conservation . here",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath3 are the mass ( charge ) of the particles of species @xmath8 ( @xmath9 labels electrons and ions , respectively ) and the plasma potential , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the radial distance , radial velocity and tangential velocity in a spherical reference frame centered on the dust grain .",
    "the radial motion of the plasma particles is governed by a one degree - of - freedom hamiltonian with effective potential @xmath13 @xmath14 second , whether the plasma particle reaches the dust is governed by @xmath15 for a typical negatively charged dust , @xmath3 is negative and monotonically increasing with @xmath16 so that @xmath17 is positive and monotonically decreasing with @xmath10 for electrons . as the result",
    ", only electrons with @xmath18 from far away can reach the dust of radius @xmath19 the final and third idea , which is a simplifying approximation , is what delineates oml from the more complete but rarely used orbital motion ( om ) theory @xcite .",
    "the oml theory approximates the @xmath20 for ions also as a monotonic function of @xmath16 which results in the simplification that ions with @xmath21 from far away can reach and charge the dust .",
    "this is a remarkable simplification since one does not need @xmath22 to evaluate the ion and the electron current collected by the dust , which are @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the elementary charge , @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the electron ( ion ) density away from the dust , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the electron ( ion ) temperature , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 setting @xmath33 , one can solve for the dust potential as a function of @xmath34 ion charge state @xmath35 and @xmath36 for an electron - proton plasma with @xmath37 oml predicts @xmath38 which is in remarkable agreement with particle - in - cell simulations  @xcite that do not make the oml assumption of ion @xmath20 being monotonic .    the oml approximation of a monotonic ion @xmath20 is known to be violated for ions with a certain range of @xmath39 this comes about  @xcite because the centrifugal potential energy @xmath40 decreases with @xmath10 at precisely @xmath41 but the electrical potential energy @xmath42 increases at a faster rate ( exponential in @xmath10 ) in the debye shielding region ,",
    "before it eventually asymptotes to @xmath43 for large @xmath44 this can produce one or multiple extrema in @xmath20 away from the dust surface , fig .",
    "[ fig : om - potential ] , which can turn back some ions in a range of @xmath45 at @xmath46 in the literature this is known as the absorption radius ( at @xmath47 ) effect for certain ions . by neglecting this subtlety , oml approximation would over - estimate the ion current to the dust .",
    "interestingly , for dust size small and even comparable to debye length , this correction appears to be small and oml prediction of dust potential remains reliable .     is shown for ions in a hydrogen plasma with different values of @xmath45 or @xmath48 @xmath49 can have extrema at @xmath47 that reflects some ions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the oml approximation ignores this absorption radius effect , which can over - estimate the ion current ( @xmath51 ) and the ion density between dust surface and the absorption radius ( @xmath52 ) . ]",
    "a far more serious problem was identified by allen , annaratone , and de angelis in 2000  @xcite that the oml theory can not predict the plasma response to the presence of a dust particle , which requires the solution of the oml poisson equation for the plasma potential @xmath53 where @xmath54 is vacuum permittivity .",

    "( [ eq : ni - oml - alpert ] ) would be an intrinsic defect which prevents the oml theory from predicting the plasma response . since the dust charge is related to the normal electric field at the dust surface , which requires the solution of @xmath59 one reaches the inevitable position from ref .",
