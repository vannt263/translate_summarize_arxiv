    "dimensionality plays a crucial role for interacting ultracold quantum gases @xcite . for a strong two - dimensional confinement ,",
    "i.e. a tight waveguide , and a close to resonant scattering process the atoms can feel the trapping potential within an individual atom - atom scattering process .",
    "a striking manifestation herefore is the confinement - induced resonance ( cir ) effect @xcite .",
    "the narrow transversal confinement leads to a singularity of the coupling constant for the corresponding effective longitudinal motion and as a result we encounter a 1d strongly interacting gas of impenetrable bosons that can be mapped at resonance on a gas of free fermions , the so - called tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "the cir has been interpreted as a feshbach resonance involving the atom - atom continuum and a bound state of a transversally excited channel of the harmonic waveguide @xcite .",
    "cirs have subsequently been discovered for three - body @xcite and four - body @xcite scattering under confinement and for a pure p - wave scattering of fermions @xcite . the cir behaviour has been found experimentally for s - wave scattering bosons @xcite and for p - wave interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "recently a dual - cir , which leads to a confinement - induced transparency effect @xcite , has been demonstrated .",
    "it is characterized by a complete suppression of strong s- and p - wave heteronuclear atomic scattering in 3d because of the presence of the waveguide .",
    "it is to be expected that waveguides with an anharmonic and/or anisotropic transversal confinement will lead to novel ultracold atomic collision properties and consequently to an intriguing many - body dynamics of the quantum gas .",
    "very first results in this direction include the observation of a modified cir due to a coupling of the center of mass ( cm ) and relative motion of the atoms @xcite .",
    "this nonseparability can be either achieved by employing anharmonic waveguides or , in case of heteronuclear collisions , by the fact that the two species experience different harmonic frequencies .    in the present work",
    "we show that the quantum dynamics of the coupled cm and relative motion for two - atomic species feeling different confinement potentials , i.e. waveguides , exhibits a resonant formation process of ultracold molecules .",
    "the latter is analyzed in detail and its existence is found to be independent of the specifics of the atomic interaction . as a consequence it is anticipated that heteronuclear atomic - molecular 1d quantum gases in an anisotropic waveguide should explore a rich many - body quantum dynamics .",
    "we employ a wave - packet dynamical approach to study the atomic scattering in waveguides which has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "the collisional dynamics of two ( distinguishable ) atoms with coordinates @xmath0 and masses @xmath1 moving in the harmonic waveguide with the transverse potential @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is described by the 4d time - dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 with the transformed hamiltonian h(_r,)= h_(_r ) + h _ ( ) + w(_r,)+v(r ) . here",
    "-(+ ) - ( -)^2 + ( m_1_1 ^ 2+m_2_2 ^ 2)_r^2 and h _ = -+ + ( + ) ^2 describe the cm and relative atomic motions , @xmath6 describes the atom - atom interaction , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the polar radial cm and the relative coordinates and @xmath9 , @xmath10 . the transformed hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is given in a rotated frame which exploits the conservation of the component ( @xmath11 ) of the total angular momentum and allows to eliminate the angular dependence of @xmath12 of the cm degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "our investigation will focus on the case @xmath13 , the later being the quantum number belonging to @xmath14 .",
    "the term w(_r,)=(_1 ^ 2-_2 ^ 2 ) r _",
    "r in the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) leads for two distinguishable atoms that feel different confining frequencies @xmath15 to a nonseparability of the cm and relative atomic motion .",
    "we integrate the schrdinger equation from time @xmath16 to the asymptotic region @xmath17 with the initial wave - packet    ( _ r,,t=0)=n r \\{- - -+ik_0z } representing two different noninteracting atoms in the transversal ground state of the waveguide with @xmath18 and the overall normalization constant @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 .",
    "we choose @xmath21 to be far from the origin @xmath22 and @xmath23 to obtain a narrow width in momentum and energy space for the initial wave - packet .",
    "our wave - packet moves with a positive interatomic velocity @xmath24 thereby approaching the scattering region located at @xmath22 .",
    "in the course of the collision , the wave - packet splits up into two parts moving in opposite directions @xmath25 .",
    "we model the interatomic interaction @xmath6 via the lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential @xmath26 .",
    "note , that the effects discussed in the following exist for even qualitatively very different shapes of the interatomic potential ( like 6 - 12 and screened coulomb @xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", our results will be universal , although the molecular formation probabilities , to some limited extend , depend on the appearance of @xmath6 . to be specific",
    "we consider the pair collisions of @xmath27k and @xmath28rb atoms with mass ration @xmath29 and the trapping frequency @xmath30 khz for rb .",
    "hereafter we use the units @xmath31 with @xmath32 mhz . for the case of a decoupled cm motion , @xmath33 in these units , whereas for the coupled case @xmath34 varies in the limits @xmath35 .",
    "our focus is the analysis of the population dynamics of molecular resonance states ( for reasons of brevity we will simply refer to them as molecular bound states with respect to @xmath6 ) for ultracold atom - atom collision in the waveguide .",
    "first we analyze how the molecular spectrum changes under the action of the confining waveguide ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we allow @xmath36 to vary for fixed @xmath37 @xcite and focus on the regime of the appearance of a bound state of @xmath6 . in case of the absence of the confining potential the first bound molecular state @xmath38 appears at @xmath39 and becomes increasingly bound with decreasing @xmath36 . to explore the dependence of the binding energies of these states on @xmath36 in the presence of the waveguide we solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem of the four - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath40 ( [ 1 ] ) employing the spectral method elaborated in ref .",
    "it is based on the computation of the autocorrelation function @xmath41 where the initial state @xmath42 can be considered as a test function of the spectrum .",
    "the solution @xmath43 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation is obtained via our wave - packet propagation method @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath44 , i.e. for a decoupled cm motion , every unconfined bound state with energy @xmath45 transforms by the action of the waveguide into the spectrum @xmath46 which represents at @xmath47 @xmath48 the spectrum of two independent identical two - dimensional oscillators with radial quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 characterizing the transverse excitations of two noninteracting atoms in the waveguide .",
    "we use @xmath51 as labels of the molecular bound states @xmath52 at fixed @xmath36 correlating to the corresponding dissociation limit ( [ 9 ] ) where they become exact quantum numbers .",
    "it is evident from ( [ 9 ] ) that for @xmath53 the excited states @xmath54 become degenerate @xmath55 . since the coupling between the cm and the relative motion is absent the quantum numbers @xmath56 and @xmath19 of the harmonic spectrum of the relative and the cm transverse eigenstates",

    "the above - discussed spectral structure of the diatomic molecule in the waveguide permits us to analyze the dynamics of atomic pair collisions with respect to the formation of molecular final states .",

    "note that during collision @xmath83 the main part of the wave - packet is temporarily in the ground state @xmath84 , decays thereafter rapidly into the continuum but part of it goes into the excited molecular state @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to this the case @xmath85 in fig.2b ( cm separation ) shows an almost complete decay into the continuum : the remaining minor part near @xmath77 is much smaller compared to the case @xmath86 .    to quantitatively investigate the molecular formation process accompanied by the cm excitation",

    "i.e. after the collision process is concluded , all the unbound part of the scattered wave - packet resides outside this region .",

    "the coupling between the @xmath99 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath100 molecular states is absent and the temporary population in the course of the collision of the molecular ground state decays back into the continuum after the collision ( see behaviour of @xmath101 . in particular @xmath102 is negligible always .",

    "accelerate up to the energy @xmath115 at the instant of collision .",
    "the occurence of the molecular state with energy @xmath116 ( bound molecular state with respect to the ground transversal channel ) as an intermediate in the course of the collision process can be seen by inspecting the intermediate probability density shown in fig.2a and fig.3 .",
    "the released energy subsequently transfers to the closed channel @xmath117 via formation of a molecule in a cm excited state since this closed channel is coupled to the @xmath82 by the term @xmath118 ( [ 3a ] ) of the total hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this mechanism also explains the delay of the onset of the collisional interaction observed in fig.[fig3 ] in the absence of the coupling term @xmath85 compared to the case @xmath15 . for @xmath85",
    "the collisional interaction happens later than for @xmath15 because the binding energy in the channel @xmath119 is considerably lower than the binding energy in the channel @xmath120 leading to a stronger atomic attraction and acceleration of the colliding atoms for @xmath15 .",
    "a simple semiclassical estimate of the time difference between the onsets of collisional interactions for the two cases is in good agreement with the numerical result of fig.[fig3 ] .    from the above scheme",
    "it also follows that if the energy release @xmath121 is equal to the excitation energy @xmath107 we have to expect a resonant enhancement of the molecular formation process i.e. we encounter the resonance condition @xmath122 to analyze the energy dependence of the atom - molecule reaction we inspect the population probabilities @xmath109 for the molecular states @xmath82 and 1 as a function of the longitudinal energies @xmath111 ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath123 were calculated after the collision at @xmath71 , in the asymptotic region where @xmath124 is very slowly decaying if @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath125 exhibits a pronounced resonant behaviour whereas @xmath126 shows a very weak energy dependence which is in agreement with the above - discussed reaction mechanism .",
    "the calculated position @xmath127 of the maximum of the population @xmath125 is shifted considerably compared to @xmath128 following from the resonance condition ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that we are using for the calculation of @xmath125 in eq.([10 ] ) the oscillator wave function @xmath129 instead of the exact transversal cm part of the molecular wave function @xmath100 .",
    "the resulting deviation from the exact resonance conditions ( [ 11 ] ) is particularly due to the missing effects of the cm coupling which provides the shift @xmath130 resulting in a significantly better agreement of the calculated position of the resonance with the resonant energy from eq.([11 ] ) .",
    "the molecular formation probability @xmath97 depends also on @xmath131 and reaches a maximum at a value corresponding to the resonance condition ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "this probability can therefore be controlled by changing the transversal confinement frequencies for the different atomic species . by nature",
    "the process we observed is a molecular resonance in the atomic scattering and back decay of the molecule to the atom - atom continuum will occur .",
    "however , this resonance possesses a long lifetime due to its two - step character which is clearly demonstrated in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "finally we note that @xmath97 amounting to several percent should not obscure the fact that substantial molecular formation rates @xmath132 could be achieved by integrating over many collisions even for low linear atomic densities @xmath133 .",
    "thus , for @xmath134@xmath135 and @xmath136nk we obtain the estimate @xmath137s@xmath138 .",
    "perspectives concerning applications of the molecular formation mechanism are based on the fact that it represents a key ingredient for the preparation and following investigation of the dynamics of mixed atomic and dipolar molecular quantum gases in waveguides .",
    "the latter are expected to possess a novel collective excitation dynamics particularly in the ultracold regime discussed here for which only a few transversal channels are accessible .",
    "if wanted , one could stabilize the molecular gas and prevent back decay into atoms by a corresponding switch of the trapping fields such that the cm decouples from the interatomic motion finally .",
    "open questions include the impact of inelastic atom - molecule and molecule - molecule collisions , which however goes beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
