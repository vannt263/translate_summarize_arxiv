    "<S> we consider a non - relativistic boson field of a homogeneous system described by the hamiltonian @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a coupling constant , which is assumed to be small and plays the role of @xmath22 in ( [ f - ser ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the existence of the parameters in non - diagonal elements is a crucial point .    comparing ( [ counter ] ) with ( [ l0 ] ) , the parameter we have utilized as a physical external source in ( [ l0 ] ) corresponds to @xmath54 in ( [ counter ] ) . equation ( [ counter ] ) </S>",

    "<S> ( of course other choices , e.g. @xmath60 , produce the same results . )    from the matrix ( [ d1 ] ) , the bare propagator @xmath61 is calculated by @xmath62 since @xmath63 has been chosen as to keep the structure ( [ structure1 ] ) unchanged , @xmath61 has the same structure in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 are replaced by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then ( [ dginv ] ) leads to the equations @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions at @xmath72 are given as @xmath73 from ( [ cond34 ] ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 are real functions . </S>",
    "<S> then the two conditions in ( [ cond12 ] ) are identical and simply express the fact that the expectation value of the equal - time commutator @xmath76 $ ] is unity . </S>",
    "<S> note that from the definition ( [ kdef ] ) , @xmath77 gives the expectation value of the number operator ( multiplied by @xmath78 ) in the absence of the interaction . which we denote as @xmath79 .    from ( [ hoko1 ] ) and ( [ hoko2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain for @xmath69 @xmath80 then exchanging @xmath15 and @xmath81 in ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) and taking the complex conjugation , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are obtained for @xmath71 . substituting them into ( [ hoko3 ] ) or ( [ hoko4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , both equations turn out to give an identical result , and we find that @xmath84 must satisfy the condition @xmath85 which gives eom for @xmath84 and is integrated as @xmath86 } = { n^{(0)}}({t_{{{\\rm i}}}})+{{\\int_{{t_{{{\\rm i}}}}}^{t}\\hspace{-0.3em}}}{{\\rm d}}s \\frac{j(s)}{\\hbar } . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{n - lowest}\\ ] ] equations ( [ k1]),([h1 ] ) and ( [ n - lowest ] ) together with the structure like ( [ structure1 ] ) determine the bare propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> as already seen from ( [ n - lowest ] ) or ( [ no - eom ] ) , we succeeded to make the expectation value of the number depend on @xmath0 in the lowest order , i.e. o(@xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the inversion formula applicable . </S>",
    "<S> the rhs of equation ( [ n - lowest ] ) corresponds to the desired lowest - order functional @xmath88 in ( [ f - ser ] ) , and ( [ no - eom ] ) is the inverted relation , the rhs of which corresponds to @xmath89 of ( [ g - ser ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the correction term is similar to the collision terms of boltzmann equation , but it has non - markovian form and contain energy non - conserving process .    </S>",
    "<S> the ordinary markovian be is obtained by the adiabatic expansion . setting the initial time @xmath102 , we abbreviate the products of @xmath90 and @xmath103 in the integrand of ( [ muc2 ] ) as @xmath104 and expand it around the time @xmath15 as @xmath105 , regarding the time differentiations to be small . </S>",
    "<S> then the integral becomes @xmath106 the second term is proportional to @xmath107 and gives a perturbative correction to the coefficient of the first term in rhs of ( [ muc2 ] ) , which can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> regarding all higher time derivatives to be small , we take into account up to the first term of ( [ adiabatic ] ) , and obtain the ordinary time - local be with energy conserving process @xmath108 the key - point of our derivation is the new type of probe introduced in ( [ d1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after that , the application of inversion formula is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> of course with the usage of higher - order inversion formulae ,  @xcite we can calculate higher - order corrections to eom quite systematically . this will be presented in other place .    </S>",
    "<S> physical contents of ( [ d1 ] ) becomes somewhat clear if we consider effective action of @xmath109 . </S>",

    "<S> roughly speaking , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath63 is the tree part of second derivative of @xmath115 . </S>",

    "<S> this may be the reason why we can handle the number with this source . </S>",
    "<S> another choice of the source corresponding to @xmath56 in ( [ counter ] ) also produces non - trivial time dependence in the lowest order and eom can be derived . </S>",
