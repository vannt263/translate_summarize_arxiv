    "an important concept in digital geometry for computer imagery is that of tunnel .",
    "intuitively , tunnels are locations in a digital object ( that is any finite set of pixels / voxels in 2d/3d ) through which a ` discrete path ' can penetrate .",
    "tunnels play an important role in rendering pixelized / voxelized scenes by casting digital rays from the image to the scene @xcite .",
    "thus it is useful to know if a digital object is tunnel - free or it has tunnels of certain type .",
    "this is particularly interesting when dealing with digital curves or surfaces",
    ". it may also be helpful to have an estimation for the number of tunnels ( if any ) in the considered object , possibly as a function of other object characteristics .",
    "such kind of information may help better understand the structure of the object . with this in mind ,",
    "our objective was to obtain a formula that relates basic parameters of a 2d digital object , such as the numbers of its pixels , vertices , holes , connected components , and tunnels .",
    "results of this kind are of interest within several disciplines , such as digital geometry for computer imagery , image analysis , computer graphics , and combinatorial geometry .",
    "let us mention , for instance , the famous euler s formula @xmath1 that relates the number of vertices , edges , and facets of a polytope , and its applications to image analysis and digital geometry @xcite .",
    "other similar results are also available ( see , e.g. , chapters 4 and 6 of @xcite ) .    the main result of this paper is the formula @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of tunnels , @xmath4 the number of vertices , @xmath5 the number of pixels , @xmath6 the number of holes , @xmath7 the number of connected components , and @xmath8 the number of @xmath0 grid squares ( called 2-_blocks _ ) in a digital object .",
    "this equality implies corollaries for the important cases of simple closed digital curves , simple digital arcs , as well as for general digital curves .    in the next section",
    "we introduce some basic notions and notations . in section 3",
    "we present our main results , and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section we recall some basic notions of digital geometry following @xcite .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite .",
    "a regular orthogonal grid subdivides @xmath9 into unit squares called _ pixels _ , that are centered at the points of @xmath10 .",
    "two pixels are called 0-_adjacent _ if they share a vertex , and 1-_adjacent _ if they share an edge . a digital object",
    "@xmath11 is a finite set of pixels .    in the following definitions @xmath12 or 1 .",
    "a @xmath13-_path _ in @xmath11 is a sequence of pixels from @xmath11 such that every two consecutive pixels are @xmath13-adjacent .",
    "two pixels of a digital object @xmath11 are _ @xmath14-connected _ ( in @xmath11 ) iff there is a @xmath13-path in @xmath11 between them .",
    "a digital object @xmath11 is _ @xmath13-connected _ iff there is a @xmath13-path connecting any two pixels of @xmath11 .",
    "the maximal ( by inclusion ) @xmath13-connected subsets of a digital object @xmath11 are called ( connected ) @xmath13-_components _ of @xmath11 . clearly , components are nonempty and distinct components are disjoint with respect to @xmath13-adjacency .",
    "let @xmath15 be a subset of a digital object @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath16 is not @xmath13-connected then the set @xmath15 is said to be @xmath13-_separating _ in @xmath11 .",
    "now let @xmath15 be a finite digital object that is @xmath13-separating in @xmath10 .",
    "the infinite 1-component of @xmath17 is called an _ improper 1-hole _ of @xmath15 , while the other ( finite ) 1-components of @xmath16 are called _ proper 1-holes _ of @xmath15 ( see fig . [ connect0 ] ) .",
    "let a digital object @xmath15 be @xmath18-separating but not @xmath19-separating in a digital object @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath15 is said to have @xmath19-_tunnels _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ connect0]a , top - left ) . for an object @xmath15 that is not separating in another object",
    "we can define a tunnel as a point that is a common vertex of two and only two pixwls of @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ connect0]a , top - right )",
    ".    a digital object without any @xmath19-tunnels is called _ tunnel - free _ ( fig .",
    "[ connect0]a , bottom ) .      to facilitate the further description , below we present a simple graphical ` language ' ( similar to venn diagrams in set theory ) , which we call the _",
    "pixel language_. we will consider different configurations of pixels , as in each there will be a ` key ' pixel , highlighted in grey , whose neighborhood is studied . here",
    "are some key points of the pixel language ( see for illustration figures [ connect1],[connect2 ] , and [ connect3 ] ) .",
    "* neighbors of the key pixel that _ must _ exist in the considered configuration will be drawn with normal continuous lines .",
    "* pixels that _ may _ or _ may not _ exist in a configuration will be drawn with dashed lines .",
    "any subset of such pixels ( in particular , no one or all of them ) may belong to the configuration or may be missing . *",
    "sometimes at least / at most / exactly one ( or more ) of these pixels will have to exist in a configuration . in order to keep our pixel language simple ,",
    "we will prefer to add relevant explanations in the text rather than to introduce further special markings ( for other purposes it may be useful to do so ) .",
    "* grid positions that can not contain pixels from the configuration will be marked by @xmath20 .",
    "* sometimes we will assign labels to pixels and with their help analyze certain possibilities .",
    "* existing path in a digital object connecting pixels from the configuration will be marked by a curve ( as in some cases of figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in this section we prove the following statement .",
    "[ th1 ] consider a digital object @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of its pixels , @xmath4 the overal number of its pixels vertices , @xmath6 the number of its holes , @xmath7 the number of its connected components , @xmath8 the number of its 2-blocks , and @xmath3 the number of its @xmath19-tunnels .",
    "then @xmath22    * proof * we use induction on the number of pixels . the statement is obviously true for a digital object consisting of a single pixel .",
    "we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which values satisfy formula ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "assume that the statement is true for a digital object composed of @xmath5 pixels , where @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that it is then true for any object composed by @xmath28 pixels .",
    "consider such an object @xmath29 and remove an arbitrary pixel @xmath30 from it .",
    "then @xmath31 is a digital object of @xmath5 pixels to which the induction hypothesis applies .",
    "let the number of its vertices , components , holes , 2-blocks , and tunnels be @xmath32 , and @xmath3 , respectively . then @xmath2 .",
    "we will see how adding pixel @xmath30 to @xmath33 can influence this last equality .",
    "we aim to show that @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the counts of pixels , vertices , components , holes , 2-blocks , and tunnels of @xmath29 , respectively . in doing so",
    ", we distinguish between 32 essentially different configurations which we group into 10 cases , some of which involve subcases .",
    "we analyze all of them with the help of illustrations using our pixel language . for the sake of better readability of the paper",
    ", we display the illustrations within three figures ( number 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , as labels of subfigures match the numeration of the cases considered .",
