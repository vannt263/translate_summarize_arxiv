    "this intrinsic randomness of the fully deterministic systems makes a statistical treatment of them feasible , which is essential for the foundations of statistical mechanics @xcite . besides , chaos plays an important role in a plenty of phenomena which is of relevance to our daily life , for instance the weather forecasting @xcite .    to characterize the chaoticity of dynamical systems , lyapunov exponents and vectors are mostly used .",
    "one important recent finding of lyapunov analysis is that for systems with continuous symmetries lyapunov vectors corresponding to near - zero lyapunov exponents have long wave - length structures , named hydrodynamic lyapunov modes ( hlms ) @xcite .",
    "this provides a new possibility to connect the reduced description of a many - body system to the microscopic information of its detailed dynamics .",
    "further investigations showed that hlms exist in a large number of systems @xcite and they have some universal features irrespective of the details of their dynamics @xcite .",
    "one should mention that localization of lyapunov vectors corresponding to the largest lyapunov exponents was also intensively studied @xcite .",
    "lyapunov analysis was conventionally undertaken via the so - called benettin algorithm @xcite , where lyapunov vectors are calculated as the set of orthogonal vectors right after reorthogonalization of offset vectors .",
    "recently , the application of another set of vectors called covariant lyapunov vectors ( clvs ) was made feasible via an efficient algorithm proposed by ginelli et al.@xcite .",
    "clvs have been shown suitable for the characterization of hyperbolicity of high dimensional systems since they are expected to span the local stable and unstable subspaces of the investigated systems . in view of the obvious difference",
    ", it becomes necessary to study the relation between clvs and the conventionally used lyapunov vectors .",
    "we denote the latter as orthogonal lyapunov vectors ( olvs ) in order to distinguish them from clvs .",
    "we first recall in sec.ii the definition and numerical calculation of both sets of vectors .",
    "the model system of coupled map lattices ( cmls ) is introduced in sec .",
    "iii . through intensive numerical simulations",
    "the following questions are addressed in the remaining sections : ( i ) will hlms survive if clvs are used instead of olvs ( sec .",
    "iv ) , ( ii ) are hlms from clvs as significant as those from olvs , ( iii ) what is the implication of the hamiltonian structure to the relation between conjugate pair of clvs , and what is the implication for the relation between coordinate and momentum parts of clvs ?",
    "recall that in the seminal work @xcite about the multiplicative ergodic theorem oseledec proved that the limit @xmath0^{\\frac{1}{2t}}$ ] exists for almost every initial point of a nonlinear dynamical system , where @xmath1 is the fundamental matrix governing the time evolution of perturbations @xmath2 in tangent space as @xmath3 .",
    "the set of lyapunov exponents are defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 .    in practice the lyapunov exponents and olvs are calculated via the so - called standard method invented by benettin and shimada et al .",

    "the time evolution of a set of offset vectors in tangent space is monitored by integrating the linearized equation . and",

    "the time averaged values of the logarithms of the renormalization factors are the lyapunov exponents and the set of offset vectors @xmath8 right after the reorthonormalization are the lyapunov vectors .",
    "the relation between the oseledec eigenvectors @xmath9 and the lyapunov vectors obtained via the standard method is subtle .",
    "it is proved that the lyapunov vectors @xmath8 obtained via the standard method converge exponentially to the oseledec eigenvectors for the inverse - time dynamics of the original system @xcite . in other words , as @xmath10 , there is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath13^{\\frac{1}{2t}}$ ] as well as its inverse @xmath14^{\\frac{1}{2t}}$ ] and @xmath15^{-1}$ ] is the fundamental matrix of the inverse - time dynamics .",

    "the set of numbers @xmath22 with degeneracy @xmath23 composes the lyapunov spectrum and the decomposition stated in eq.([sp ] ) is called the oseledec splitting .",
    "the spanning vectors @xmath24 of the oseledec subspace @xmath25 are the clvs .",
    "in contrast to the popularity of olvs , the use of clvs was made feasible only recently owing to an efficient algorithm proposed by ginelli et al . @xcite .",
    "the new algorithm relies on the information obtained via the standard method of benettin .",
    "one additional integration of the inverse - time dynamics is performed in order to get clvs and the corresponding fluctuating finite - time lyapunov exponents .",
    "the basic idea is that an arbitrary offset vector will approach asymptotically the most unstable direction corresponding to the largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "it is known that the covariant @xmath26-dimensional subspace spanned by the first @xmath26 clvs is spanned by the first @xmath26 olvs as well .",
    "an arbitrary offset vector confined to this subspace will approach asymptotically the @xmath26-th clv if the inverse - time tangent space dynamics is applied . to this aim",
