    "the concept of persistent excitation is well - known in the control community . since the pioneers works of anderson @xcite and moore @xcite , this concept has been successfullly used in a large variety of fields of application going from economics @xcite , @xcite , to adaptive or learning control @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or mechanical engineering and robotics @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a persistently excited adaptive tracking control in the multidimensional arx framework .",
    "it allows us to avoid the strong controllability assumption recently proposed by bercu and vazquez @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we shall establish the almost sure convergence for both least squares ( ls ) and weighted least squares ( wls ) estimators of the unknown parameters of arx model .",
    "the asymptotic normality as well as a law of iterated logarithm are also provided .",
    "consider the @xmath0-dimensional autoregressive process with adaptive control of order @xmath1 , @xmath2 for short , given for all @xmath3 by @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the shift - back operator and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the system output , input and driven noise , respectively .",

    "in addition , we suppose that the driven noise @xmath20 satisfies the strong law of large numbers i.e. if @xmath27 then the sequence @xmath28 converges to @xmath29 a.s .",
    "that is the case if , for example , @xmath20 is a white noise or if @xmath20 has a finite conditional moment of order @xmath30 . +    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section @xmath31 deals with the parameter estimation and the persistently excited adaptive tracking control .",
    "section @xmath32 is devoted to the introduction of the schur complement approach together with some linear algebra calculations . in section @xmath33 , we propose some usefull almost sure convergence properties together with a central limit theorem ( clt ) and a law of iterated logarithm ( lil ) for both ls and wls estimators .",

    "in the arx tracking framework , we must deal with two objectives simultaneously . on the one hand , it is necessary to estimate the unknown parameter @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the output @xmath36 has to track , step by step , a predictable reference trajectory @xmath37 .",
    "first , we focus our attention on the estimation of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "we shall make use of the wls algorithm which satisfies , for all @xmath3 , @xmath38 where the initial value @xmath39 may be arbitrarily chosen and @xmath40 where the identity matrix @xmath41 with @xmath42 is added in order to avoid the useless invertibility assumption .",
    "the choice of the weighted sequence @xmath43 is crucial . if @xmath44 we find the standard ls estimator , while if @xmath45 , @xmath46 we obtain the wls estimator introduced by bercu and duflo @xcite , @xcite .",
    "next , we are concern with the choice of the adaptive control sequence @xmath47 .",
    "the crucial role played by @xmath48 is to regulate the dynamic of the process @xmath49 by forcing @xmath50 to track a predictable reference trajectory @xmath37 .",
    "we propose to make use of the persistently excited adaptive tracking control given , for all @xmath51 , by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an exogenous noise of dimension @xmath0 , adapted to @xmath54 , with mean @xmath55 and positive definite covariance matrix @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath53 is independent of @xmath57 , of @xmath37 , and of the initial state of the system . moreover , we suppose that @xmath53 satisfies the strong law of large numbers . consequently , if @xmath58 then the sequence @xmath59 converges to @xmath60 a.s . by substituting ( [ control ] ) into ( [ mod ] ) , we obtain the closed - loop system @xmath61 where the prediction error @xmath62 . furthermore , we assume in all the sequel that the reference trajectory @xmath37 satisfies @xmath63 finally , let @xmath64 be the average cost matrix sequence defined by @xmath65 the tracking is said to be residually optimal if @xmath64 converges to @xmath60 a.s .",

    "proof of theorem [ aspls ]    in order to prove theorem [ aspls ] , we shall make use of the same approach than bercu @xcite or guo and chen @xcite .",
    "first of all , we recall that for all @xmath3 @xmath181 it follows from ( [ eqbasis ] ) together with the strong law of large numbers for martingales ( see e.g. corollary 1.3.25 of @xcite ) that @xmath182 a.s .",
