    "the motivation for this work originates from wigner s famous paper , `` the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences '' @xcite , and comments about the ideas implied by the paper @xcite .",
    "this work has inspired others to investigate this problem from different angles @xcite .",
    "it also inspired attempts by this author to work towards a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together @xcite .",
    "a possible opening in this direction was the observation that in gauge theories , one starts with separate vector spaces at each point in space time @xcite .",
    "matter fields , @xmath5 take values , @xmath6 in the vector space at location @xmath7 the freedom of basis choice in the vector spaces , based on the work of yang and mills @xcite , led to the use of gauge group transformations to relate states in the different vector spaces .",
    "one result of this work was the development of the standard model , which has been so successful in physics .",
    "this work was extended by the observation that it is worth exploring consequences of replacing the one set of complex scalars , associated with all the vector spaces , by separate sets of complex scalars associated with each space time point .",
    "extension of the freedom of basis choice in the vector spaces to include freedom of number scaling , led to the presence of a new spin @xmath8 scalar field , @xmath0 in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "number scaling is based on the description of the different types of mathematical systems as structures @xcite .",
    "these consist of a base set of elements , and sets of basic operations , relations and constants that satisfy a relevant set of axioms .",
    "number values can be scaled , provided the basic operations are scaled appropriately @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas behind the extension of gauge theories were expanded by first noting that other types of numbers , from the natural numbers to the real numbers , can be defined as substructures of the complex numbers . the fact that complex or other types of numbers are part of the description of many types of mathematical systems , vector spaces , algebras , groups , etc .",
    ", led to the description of local collections or universes of mathematical systems at each point of a space and time manifold , @xmath3 .",
    "consequences of this assumption of local mathematics for theoretical descriptions of nonlocal physical properties were described .",
    "the effect of number scaling on these properties and the resulting restrictions on the properties of the scalar field , @xmath0 were discussed @xcite .",
    "this work expands the earlier work by paying more attention to the effects of coordinate charts that map @xmath3 onto space and time structures in the individual universes .",
    "the lifting of the description of nonlocal physical properties , such as space and time integrals or derivatives based on @xmath9 to those based on the space and time structures in the universes , is described .",
    "the work is organized by first giving , in section [ gtc ] , a brief summary of the extension of gauge theories to include the effects of number scaling .",
    "this is followed by a description of local universes , section [ lmu ] .",
    "included are descriptions of some general properties , of the universes , relations of observers to the universes , gauge theories in the universes , and maps between structures in different universes .",
    "section [ sti ] describes the effects of the presence of local universes on space and/or time integrals .",
    "both global and local descriptions are included .",
    "so far the effects of scaling on the integrals have not been included in the local universes , this is taken care of in the next section .",
    "a final discussion section completes the paper .",
    "as noted , gauge theory considerations were the original motivation for earlier work and for this work . in gauge theories",
    "one starts with vector spaces , @xmath10 at each point , @xmath11 of a space time manifold , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "fields , @xmath5 are maps from @xmath9 to points in the vector spaces where , for each point , @xmath2 in @xmath9 @xmath12 is a vector in @xmath13    derivatives , @xmath14 , of the field at @xmath11 in the direction @xmath15 , expressed as @xmath16 do not make sense .",
    "the reason is that @xmath17 and @xmath12 are in distinct vector spaces , @xmath18 and @xmath13 subtraction of vectors is not defined for vectors in different spaces .",
    "it is defined only for vectors in the same space .",
    "this problem is well known @xcite .",
    "it is remedied by introducing a unitary gauge operator @xmath19 that maps @xmath17 in @xmath18 into a vector , @xmath20 in @xmath21 .",
    "the map also accounts for the freedom of basis choice of vectors in the neighboring vector spaces , an idea originally proposed by yang mills @xcite for isospin vector spaces and extended by utiyama @xcite to @xmath22 dimensional spaces .",
    "the resulting covariant derivative , @xmath23 is given by@xmath24    the earlier work @xcite begins with this description of covariant derivatives in gauge theories .",
    "it is noted that only one common complex , scalar field , @xmath25 is associated with the different vector spaces @xmath13 this seems strange , especially since the basic axiomatic description of vector spaces includes scalar fields .",
    "this suggested an extension of gauge theories by replacing the one common scalar field by local scalar fields , @xmath26 associated with @xmath21 for each @xmath11 in @xmath3 .",
    "this change results in the expansion of the gauge group @xmath27 for @xmath22 dimensional fields and vector spaces to @xmath28 .",
    "this adds an extra factor into the expression for the covariant derivative . the operator @xmath19 in eq .",
    "[ dmux ] is replaced by @xmath29 the factor , @xmath30 maps numbers in @xmath31 to numbers in @xmath32 just as @xmath19 maps vectors in @xmath18 to vectors in @xmath21 .",
    "as will be noted shortly @xmath33 acts on vectors as well as on scalars .",
    "the usual use of gauge theories in physics and in the standard model already implicitly includes the operator @xmath33 for the special case that this operator is the identity operator .",
    "this means that @xmath34 is the same number value in @xmath32 as @xmath35 is in @xmath36 for this case , replacement of the one set of complex numbers , @xmath25 by local ones , @xmath32 at each point has no effect .",
    "however this is a special case of a more general effect . just as the gauge operator",
    ", @xmath19 differs from the identity to account for the freedom of basis choice in the vector spaces , the operator , @xmath33 can differ from the identity to take account of the freedom of scaling of the complex numbers .",
    "the possibility that numbers can be scaled is based on the mathematical logical definition of different types of mathematical systems as model structures @xcite .",
    "these structures consist of a base set of elements , a few basic operations , none or a few basic relations , and a few constants .",
    "the properties of the structures must be such that the set of axioms , that are relevant to the system type being discussed , must be true .",
    "this description holds for all types of numbers , vector spaces , algebras groups , and many other system types .    as examples , the structure for complex numbers",
    "is given by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the set of base elements as complex number values , and @xmath8 and @xmath39 are constants .",
    "the operations have their intended meaning . the structure",
    ", @xmath25 must satisfy the axioms for an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the structure for ( normed ) vector spaces , @xmath40 is given by @xmath41here @xmath42 is a base set of vectors , @xmath43 denotes scalar vector multiplication , @xmath44 denotes the norm , and @xmath45 denotes an arbitrary vector .",
    "it is not a constant .",
    "if the norm is derived from an inner product , @xmath46 and the space is complete in the norm , then @xmath47 is a hilbert space @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 here and in what follows , structures are distinguished from base sets by an overline .",
    "thus @xmath25 is a structure with @xmath38 a base set .",
    "the possibility of number scaling is based on the observation that complex number structures can be scaled by an arbitrary real number , @xmath49 and still preserve the truth of the relevant axioms .",
    "the scaled structure @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 the first representation of @xmath50 differs from @xmath25 in eq .",
    "[ bc ] by the presence of the subscript @xmath52 on each of the components .",
    "the subscript , @xmath53 indicates that the components of @xmath50 are scaled by a factor , @xmath53 relative to the unscaled components of @xmath54 details of the scaling are shown by the second representation of @xmath55 this representation shows the components of @xmath50 in terms of the unscaled components in @xmath54 for example , multiplication in @xmath50 corresponds to multiplication in @xmath25 divided by @xmath53 and division in @xmath50 corresponds to division in @xmath25 times @xmath56 also the number values that are zero and the identity in the first representation of @xmath50 correspond to the number values @xmath8 and @xmath52 in the second representation .",
    "addition and subtraction are unaffected by scaling .",
    "the choice of the scaling factors for the basic operations in @xmath50 is not arbitrary .",
    "they are chosen so that @xmath50 satisfies the complex number axioms if and only if @xmath25 does .",
    "the proof that the definition of @xmath50 satisfies this requirement is straight forward and will not be repeated here . as an example , the proof that @xmath52 is the multiplicative identity in @xmath50 if and only if @xmath39 is the multiplicative identity in @xmath25 is given by the following equivalences:@xmath57the first and second equations refer to the first and second representations of @xmath50 and the third refers to @xmath54    the invariance of the truth of the relevant axioms under scaling is an important requirement .",
    "it follows from this that complex analysis based on scaled complex numbers is equivalent to that based on unscaled numbers .",
    "equivalence means that every unscaled element in analysis has a corresponding scaled element in the scaled number analysis , and conversely .",
    "also the truth of equations in scaled analysis is preserved under mapping to the corresponding equations in unscaled analysis .",
    "for example , for any analytic function , @xmath58 one has @xmath59as was the case for eq .",
    "[ ideq ] , the first and second equations refer to the first and second representations of @xmath60 and the third one refers to @xmath54 these equivalences follow from the definition of analytic functions in terms of convergent power series @xcite .",
    "the same description also holds for real analysis as real numbers are scaled in a similar fashion .",
    "complex number scaling has an effect on vector spaces in general and on hilbert spaces as a specific example .",
    "the components of a scaled vector space structure , @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 here the norm , in @xmath47 of a vector , @xmath63 with @xmath64 is assumed to satisfy , @xmath65 the righthand representation of @xmath61 shows the representation of the components of @xmath61 in terms of those of @xmath66 the corresponding representations of complex number structures , @xmath50 , and @xmath67 are associated with the two representations of @xmath68    for hilbert spaces the scaled structures are given by @xmath69 the righthand representation of @xmath70 shows the representation of components of the scaled structure in terms of those of the unscaled @xmath71 as was the case for complex numbers , the scaled structures satisfy the relevant axioms if and only if the unscaled structures do . that limits scaling to just the complex numbers .",
    "for this representation the right hand structure in eq .",
    "[ bhr ] is replaced by @xmath72 this scaled representation is not used here because , for @xmath22 ( and infinite ) dimensional hilbert spaces , this representation does not satisfy the well known equivalence , @xmath73 it is assumed here that this equivalence also extends to normed vector spaces . ]",
    "the scaling of vector spaces , eq . [ bvr ] , affects the covariant derivative in eq .",
    "this follows from the replacement of the vector spaces @xmath21 by scaled vector spaces @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a real positive space time dependent scaling factor . in this case",
    "the action of the operator , @xmath33 becomes multiplication by the positive real number , @xmath76    the space time dependence of the scaling factor can be represented by a scalar field , @xmath77 as @xmath78 in this case the factor , @xmath33 in the covariant derivative becomes multiplication by @xmath79 . here the vector field , @xmath80 is the gradient of @xmath81    note that the value of @xmath82 has no effect on physics .",
    "the effect on physics is limited to the gradient of @xmath0 or differences between the values of @xmath82 at different points of space and time .",
    "use of this extension of the covariant derivative with the requirement that all lagrangians be invariant under local @xmath27 gauge transformations , as is done in the usual development of gauge theories , gives the result that the field @xmath4 is a spin @xmath8 scalar boson .",
    "there are no restrictions on whether or not the boson has mass .    the fact that , so far , one can not make a definite association of @xmath82 to any existing or proposed scalar field in physics , places some limitations on the properties of the field .",
    "one is that the ratio of the coupling constant for this field to fermion fields must be very small compared to the fine structure constant .",
    "this follows from the fact that there is no evidence for an effect of @xmath4 in the very accurate description of experiments by qed .",
    "another restriction on @xmath4 is that the variation of @xmath82 in the region of cosmological space and time occupied by us , as intelligent observers , must be very small .",
    "however , there are no restrictions on the space and time dependence of @xmath82 at cosmological distances that are far away in space and or time from our local region .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there are many possible candidates for the physical description of @xmath83 these include the higgs boson , the inflaton , quintessence , and other scalar fields that are proposed in the literature on cosmology @xcite .",

    "the nonlocality of these examples occurs within @xmath91 .",

    "it is best to regard each local mathematical universe as an open collection of mathematical systems .",
    "one reason is that specification of the totality of mathematical systems in each @xmath91 is not possible , nor is it even desirable .",
    "local universes can be expanded by inclusion of new mathematical systems that are defined or discovered by mathematicians and physicists , and this process is expected to be unending .",
    "the openness of the universes represents a change from the view used in previous work @xcite .",
    "there the universes were regarded as closed collections containing all the mathematics that an observer can know in principle .",
    "the arguments given above strongly suggest that these universes can never be closed .",
    "even though the local universes are open and can not be specified in detail , they do have some interesting properties . as noted above",
    ", they do contain structures for all types of numbers and for many types of mathematical systems that include numbers in their description .",

    "all valid equations relate elements that are within the same structure and within the same universe .",
    "the few invalid equations that do not satisfy this requirement will be described as meaningless or not defined .",
    "there is an aspect of the relation between observers and mathematics that supports the idea of local mathematical universes .",
    "mathematical logic emphasizes the distinction between syntactic and semantic structures in mathematics .",
    "semantic structures and their relations , as models of relevant axiom sets , are the ones that are described in various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics . as such",
    "they are required to have meaning .",
    "the `` meaning of meaning '' in mathematics is a subject of much discussion @xcite .",
    "here there is no intention to delve into this topic .",
    "the only aspect of meaning that is relevant is that statements and properties of mathematical ( and physical ) systems are meaningful only in the minds of observers as intelligent beings . in the absence of observers",
    ", no meaning can be given to mathematical ( or physical ) statements or to their truth or falseness .",
    "the brain of an observer is the seat of meaningfulness in that statements and equations are meaningful to an observer only when registered in the brain .",
    "mathematical information in textbooks or spoken by a lecturer is meaningless until it has entered the the observers brains .",
    "it follows from this , and the relatively small size of a brain , that meaningfulness is a local concept limited to the size of the brain . here , to make things simple",
    ", it is assumed that observers and their brains occupy points in the physical space and time manifold , @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the mathematics that can have meaning to an observer , @xmath120 at point @xmath11 of @xmath9 is limited to the structures and systems at @xmath11 .",
    "this is the mathematics in @xmath101 if the observer moves on a world path , @xmath121 then at proper time @xmath122 the collection of systems that can have meaning to @xmath123 are those in @xmath124    the use of the expression , `` can have meaning '' instead of `` have meaning '' shows that this is a one way implication only . the implication , if structure @xmath113 has meaning to @xmath125 then it is in @xmath91 , is valid .",
    "the converse is not necessarily valid because an observer may not understand , or know very little mathematics .    the relations of observers to the underlying manifold , @xmath9 and to local universes",
    "can be made clear by means of a figure , shown here as figure [ spie41 ] .",
    "this figure shows two universes and two observers at points @xmath11 and @xmath126 for a @xmath127 dimensional flat manifold , @xmath128 the two are representative of the infinite number of universes , each associated with a point of @xmath3 .",
    "coordinate systems are represented as are collective representations of a few of the different types of systems .",
    "the overlined dots stand for many other types of mathematical systems in the universes .",
    "it should be noted that these local universes are assumed to exist at all points , @xmath11 of @xmath9 independent of the presence of an observer .",
    "the fact that properties of mathematical structures and the mathematics of theoretical physics in @xmath112 can have meaning to an observer at @xmath11 is accounted for by their equivalent representations in @xmath91 .",

    "the magnitudes of physical quantities at far away locations are represented by us , locally , as scaled magnitudes .",

    "so far general relativity has not been treated here .",
    "this needs to be changed .",
    "expansion of this work to include general relativity is work for the future . also quantum mechanical effects need to be more deeply embedded into the setup than is shown by the wave packet example described earlier .",
    "a fact that may help in expanding the description of local mathematics and scaling is that the inclusion of number scaling into gauge theories results in a vector field , @xmath80 description of scaling .",
    "the scalar field @xmath4 was introduced by the additional assumption that @xmath315 is conservative and is the gradient of a scalar field , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if one drops this assumption , then the description of space time integrals gets much more complicated because space and time integrals must include path dependence , perhaps as path integrals .",
    "another somewhat more philosophic point concerns the relation of observers to the manifold , @xmath3 and the local universes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ spie41 ] , observers are at different locations , @xmath148 on @xmath3 in the cosmologically local reference region .",
    "the mathematics available to an observer at @xmath11 is that in @xmath101 here @xmath3 is supposed to represent the actual physical cosmological space and time with observers at positions in the local reference region .",
    "as long as observers in the local region are describing properties of physical systems within the universe , this picture is valid .",
    "the possibility of problems arises when observers attempt to describe the evolution and dynamics of the universe as a whole.this requires that mathematical descriptions of @xmath3 , and all systems within the universe , including the observers , and a description of the universe itself , be described within a local universe .    achieving this seems problematic at least from a mathematical viewpoint .",
    "there is no problem in including observers as physical systems .",
    "however an observers description of the physical universe is a metamathematical description of a theory describing the universe . as such it is outside the universe , and it places some aspects of the observer outside the universe .",
    "one aspect of this is that it includes lifting @xmath3 past an observer into a local universe so that mathematically the observer is now external to @xmath3 .",
    "this problem might be solved if one can find a mathematical description or model , in @xmath1 of an observer , at @xmath11 and outside of @xmath1 describing a mathematical model of the physical universe in @xmath91 .",
    "this seems problematic at best .",
