    "characterization of statistical properties of coherent waves propagating through an elastically scattering disordered medium is relevant for a variety of physical situations , ranging from propagation of electromagnetic waves through interstellar space or the atmosphere , seismology , and medical imaging by ultrasound or light , to electron transport in disordered conductors .",
    "when coherent waves propagate through such media their intensity exhibits random , sample - specific , fluctuations known as speckles .",
    "these fluctuations result from the interference of rays traveling along different paths . in this article",
    "we study the statistics of speckles .",
    "the problem can be characterized by several length scales : the propagation distance of the ray through the medium , @xmath0 , the elastic mean free path , @xmath1 , which is the typical distance the ray travels between two scattering events , and the transport mean free path , @xmath2 which characterizes the typical distance for backscattering . in the limit of very thin sample , @xmath3 , rays move almost ballistically through the sample , since scattering porbability is small .",
    "this regime has been extensively studied  @xcite . in the opposite limit of a very wide sample , @xmath4",
    ", the rays propagate diffusively in the system .",
    "this regime has been considered in refs .  .",
    "at spatial scales exceeding the transport mean free path the statistical properties of speckles in the diffusive regime ( excluding features associated with rare events ) are characterized by the diffusion coefficient and are independent of the details of the disorder .",
    "the crossover between the ballistic and the diffusive regimes depends , in general , on the features of the disorder .",
    "however , when the typical deflection angle for a single scattering is small , and therefore the transport mean free path @xmath2 is much larger than the mean free path @xmath1 , a third regime emerges .",
    "this regime , known as the directed waves regime , is realized when the sample width is much smaller than the transport mean free path while it is much larger than the elastic mean free path , @xmath5 . in this case , the rays experience many small angle scattering events which result in a diffusive dynamics of the ray direction . the total change in propagation direction",
    ", however , remains small .",
    "the focus of our study is on directed waves which are important for many applications ranging from laser communications in atmosphere to propagation of acoustic or electromagnetic waves through biological tissues .",
    "similarly to the ballistic and the diffusive regimes , the directed waves regime has also been studied in many papers ( see for example refs .   and references therein ) . however , our results , in many respects , differ substantially from those obtained in previous studies .",
    "one of the main differences is the slow power law decay of the intensity correlation function in space , and the change of its sign , see fig .",

    "this method , which is similar ( but not identical ) to the langevin scheme for the description of classical fluctuations @xcite , enables one to treat both the diffusive and the directed wave regimes on equal footing .",
    "we apply the method to the case of directed waves to evaluate speckle correlations and their sensitivity to various perturbations , such as a change in the frequency of the wave , a variation of the incidence angle , or a change of the refraction index .",

    "the above model is studied below .",
    "the central object of our approach is the ray distribution function , @xmath20 which may be viewed as the density of rays at the point @xmath21 and time @xmath22 propagating in the direction specified by the unit vector @xmath23 . in particular the intensity of the wave at the point @xmath21 is @xmath24 .",

    "in this subsection we discuss a general approach to describe speckles of coherent waves that is valid both in the ballistic and diffusive regimes , and holds for a general angular dependence of the scattering amplitude at a single scatterer .",
    "a general method for calculating moments of the ray distribution function is the disorder diagram technique  @xcite .",
