    "conventional implementations of quantum algorithms entail application of unitary transformations and projective measurements to a single , multi - qubit quantum system which is initially prepared in a known pure state  @xcite . in the alternative ensemble paradigm ,",
    "of which solution state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is the most prominent example , the algorithm is implemented on an ensemble of multiple identical , noninteracting quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the principal differences between the two paradigms manifest themselves in the preparation , measurement and post - measurement stages and arise from : ( i ) the impossibility of isolating any given ensemble members and applying preparation , evolution and measurement operations to these alone while ignoring the remaining ensemble members and ( ii ) the fact that available initial states are mixed .",
    "the principal similarity between the paradigms is that it is possible to apply identical unitary evolution operators to each ensemble member at any stage of the algorithm .",
    "a variety of schemes have been developed to deal with the initialization , measurement and algorithm output issues in ensemble implementations of quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "collectively these issues are resolved via the use of a _ pseudopure initial state _ , for whose preparation there are several known schemes  @xcite , described by the density operator @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of qubits , @xmath5 is the initial pure state required by the conventional ( single quantum system ) implementation of the algorithm and @xmath6",
    "is called the _ polarization .",
    "_ under the unitary transformation for the algorithm , @xmath7 , the density operator transforms to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the final , pre - measurement state of the quantum system in the conventional implementation of the algorithm .",
    "this gives the appearance of a conventional realization of the algorithm on a subset of the ensemble which is initially described by the density operator @xmath10 which corresponds to a pure state . in most proposals for and realizations of ensemble implementations the algorithm output is extracted from the expectation values of single qubit traceless observables  @xcite , as we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : groverensemble ] .",
    "such expectation values are deterministic . however , in real implementations the number of ensemble members is finite and expectation values can only be approximated by sample averages .",
    "thus , regardless of the nature of the original quantum algorithm , ensemble implementations are probabilistic ( except possibly in the special case where @xmath11 which reduces to a conventional implementation ) .",
    "although this basic feature has been noted  @xcite , there has been limited discussion of its implications with regard to reasonable comparisons of ensemble implementations of quantum algorithms to probabilistic classical competitors .",
    "such issues have been addressed in the context of various ensemble implementations of single bit output algorithms such as the deutsch - jozsa algorithm  @xcite , resulting in bounds of the polarization beneath which a classical probabilistic algorithm will succeed with greater probability than the ensemble implementation of the quantum algorithm .    in this article",
    "we compare the performance of an ensemble implementation of the grover search algorithm to probabilistic classical sequential searches .",
    "our aim is to determine the polarization as a function of both ensemble and database size such that the ensemble implementation of the quantum algorithm succeeds with greater probability than its classical competitor .",
    "the primary distinction between this and previous work on the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is that the output of the grover algorithm is determined from measurements on many qubits and that these measurement outcomes are correlated .",

    "the task is to find the location of the marked item , @xmath13 with the help of an oracle , @xmath14 a classical sequential search proceeds by evaluating the oracle at distinct database locations and on average requires @xmath15 such oracle queries to determine the marked item s location .",
    "the grover search algorithm  @xcite requires @xmath16 qubits whose computational basis states @xmath17 can be regarded as representing database locations .",
    "the oracle is implemented via a unitary transformation , defined on the computational basis states as @xmath18 and extended linearly to all superpositions .",
    "the oracle is easily extended to the database locations @xmath19 by setting @xmath20 at these points .",
