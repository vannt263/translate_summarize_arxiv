    "<S> concentration of the strongest transitions on the high - energy side of some emission , photoexcitation and auger spectra of atoms is related with the existence of the additional selection rule for the number of vacancy - electron pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> published in : _ _ * v34 * </S>",
    "<S> no22 l741    online at : _ http://stacks.iop.org/jphysb/34/ _    </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of the oscillator strength near the high - energy side of the transition array was first established for the @xmath0 photoexcitation spectra from lanthanides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath1 orbital is collapsed the most intensive lines of these transitions form the so - called giant resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of the strongest transition lines manifests itself also from some characteristic emission spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this regularity was noticed in a survey of experimental analysis of @xmath2 transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a tendency was also demonstrated by the calculations of complex spectra for various sm ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect explains the appearance of narrow continuum band in the emission of laser produced plasma from rare - earth elements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shift to the high - energy side of some complex auger spectra corresponding to transitions from the initial @xmath3 configuration was predicted and illustrated by calculations for lanthanide atoms in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such an effect takes place for the configurations with two open shells with the same principal quantum number , when the coulomb exchange interaction mainly determines the energy level spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction forms the upper and the lower groups of levels , with very different abilities to participate in the transitions . due to the relation between the position of level and the transition amplitude from this level @xcite , the transitions from mainly the upper group of levels of initial configuration manifest themselves in the radiative or auger spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement of some transitions and near - forbiddenness of the other transitions indicates the existence of an additional selection rule . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is the formulation of such a rule .    in the case of the configuration with one vacancy @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested @xcite ( and generalised for any configuration with two open shells @xmath5 @xcite ) to classify the energy levels in a way which preserves @xmath6 parentage . </S>",
    "<S> such basis can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix of the main coulomb exchange coefficient @xmath7 . the algebraic way to construct this basis by using a special operator @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> was proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> operator @xmath8 is defined by :    @xmath9}^{(10)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is an electron creation operator with an orbital rank @xmath11 and spin rank @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a vacancy creation operator , equal to the electron annihilation operator @xmath14 . @xmath14 only becomes the irreducible tensor when multiplied by a phase factor , thus in ( [ eq1 ] ) the following operator is used :    @xmath15    we shall consider the configurations @xmath5 with two neighbouring shells , they are designated @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> while acting upon the wavefunction of configuration @xmath17 the operator @xmath8 creates a vacancy in the @xmath18 shell and an electron in the @xmath19 shell . </S>",
    "<S> thus the wavefunction of configuration @xmath16 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> due to the ranks of operator @xmath8 in the orbital ( @xmath20 ) and spin ( @xmath21 ) spaces the vacancy - electron pair @xmath22 is coupled to a term @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new quantum number @xmath24 equal to the number of such vacancy - electron pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration @xmath25 has no vacancies in @xmath26 shell , so @xmath27 . after acting by operators @xmath8 repeatedly , various states of configurations @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) with different numbers </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 can be obtained . to be exact , the complete basis for a given configuration </S>",
    "<S> may be built with the aid of operators @xmath30 having general ranks @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33^{(ls)}_{m_{l}m_{s } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lo{\\times } \\left ( l^{n_{1}}_{1}l^{n_{2}}_{2}\\gamma pls\\right . </S>",
    "<S> \\left\\vert l^{n_{1}+1}_{1}l^{n_{2}-1}_{2}\\gamma ' p ' l 's , l_1^{-1}l_2~k\\kappa\\right)~\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 if the fractional parentage coefficient ( the last multiplier on the right - hand side ) for @xmath35 is non - zero , and remains @xmath36 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the labelling of those basis functions would generally require some other quantum numbers @xmath37 of a two - shell system besides the number of @xmath23 pairs @xmath24 and the resultant @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> however , only @xmath24 is important for this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this new basis was named the hole - particle ( hp ) basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be chosen in such a way that for the configuration @xmath25 its functions coincide with the functions of a single open shell of the usual basis . </S>",
    "<S> the values of these coefficients can be calculated using the recurrency relations similar to those derived for the two - electron coefficients @xcite .    in the second quantization representation </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element of coulomb exchange interaction between the two open shells is : @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the slater radial integrals . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the angular coefficient @xmath7 at the main ( dipole ) part of this interaction is easily obtained from the above by putting a projector onto complete basis @xmath41 in between the two @xmath8-type operators ( creation and annihilation of a @xmath23-coupled pair)@xcite : @xmath42 the first term - dependent part of this coefficient would remain non - diagonal with respect to the quantum numbers @xmath43 unless we demand explicitly that all the fractional parentage coefficients but one involved in ( [ eq4 ] ) are equal to @xmath44 for the given @xmath45 term . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by exploiting the freedom of choice of fractional parentage coefficients for the repeating terms with same resultant @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> then the first , positive , part of @xmath7 contributes only to those terms of configuration @xmath16 which are the daughters of @xmath17 terms ( additionally characterized by @xmath46 ) and a @xmath22 @xmath47 pair , and it vanishes for the other terms that do not satisfy the condition of having an additional vacancy - electron pair @xmath47 ( in this case the coefficient @xmath7 takes the negative constant value determined by the second part of @xmath7 in ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the selection rule for the dipole transition amplitude with respect to the quantum number @xmath24 follows from the simple relation between the operator @xmath8 and the radiative dipole transition operator @xmath48 in the second quantization representation for the considered transitions @xmath49 : @xmath50 one obtains : @xmath51 } \\left ( l^{n_{1}+1}_{1}l^{n_{2}-1}_{2}\\gamma ' p'~l 's , l_1^{-1}l_2~^{1}{\\rm p}\\right\\vert \\left . </S>",
    "<S> l^{n_{1}}_{1}l^{n_{2}}_{2}\\gamma pls\\right ) \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\lo{\\times } \\langle l_{1}\\vert c^{(1)}\\vert l_{2}\\rangle \\langle n_1l_1\\left.\\right| r \\left|\\right . </S>",
    "<S> n_2l_{2}\\rangle \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity in square brackets is the clebsch - gordan coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the pure hp coupling only the transitions obeying the rule @xmath52 are possible . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of such a selection rule was suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there were also attempts to explain the preference of some transitions using the usual basis : it was indicated in @xcite that the dipole transitions from @xmath53 mainly went to the states of @xmath54 ( however , all electrons of the same shell must be treated equivalently in this basis ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the auger transition operator corresponding to the transitions @xmath55 can be expressed by a scalar product of operator @xmath8 ( [ eq1 ] ) and the other similar operator creating a vacancy in @xmath56 or @xmath57 shell and a free electron @xcite . consequently , in the hp basis the auger transition amplitude is presented as the product of two matrix elements ; for the first of them the selection rule with respect to the @xmath24 quantum number also applies .    </S>",
    "<S> the selection rule for the number of pairs will manifest itself in the emission spectra if the hp basis describes the involved configurations well . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the wavefunction expansions in the hp and in the usual basis was performed for the rb  iv @xmath58 and ba  xii @xmath59 @xcite configurations as well as for k  i @xmath60 and rb  i @xmath61 isoelectronic sequences @xcite . in all these cases </S>",
    "<S> the leading weights become larger for the majority of levels and even close to 1 for several levels ( especially from the upper group ) in an hp basis . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ weights ] the results for the upper terms which mainly take part in the radiative transitions are presented for co  ix @xmath60 and co  viii @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> high purities of the wave functions confirm the conjecture that this basis suits well for the description of considered spectra . </S>",
    "<S> some reasons for the preciseness of the hp basis may be pointed out : ( a ) the main part of the interaction dominating in such configuration only has diagonal matrix elements ; ( b ) in the hp basis some matrix elements connecting such configuration with the other configuration of the same complex vanish @xcite ( since the corresponding operator , similarly as the auger transition operator , can be expressed by the operator @xmath8 ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .    @l*15@l configuration & term , & + & @xmath63&usual @xmath38 basis&hp </S>",
    "<S> basis +    @xmath64&@xmath65 & 0.7137&0.9996 + & @xmath66 & 0.7452&0.9990 + & @xmath67 & 0.5132&0.9815 + & & & + @xmath68&@xmath69 & 0.7097 & 0.9476 + & @xmath70 & 0.7884 & 0.9992 + & @xmath71 & 0.3710 & 0.9977 + & @xmath72 & 0.5286 & 0.9973 + & @xmath73 & 0.5870 & 0.9982 + & @xmath74 & 0.6714 & 0.9948 + & @xmath75 & 0.4899 & 0.9859 + & @xmath76 & 0.3435 & 0.9914 + & @xmath77 & 0.9991 & 0.9386 + & @xmath78 & 0.6240 & 0.9073 +    the calculations in intermediate coupling give small intensities of lines that are forbidden by the indicated selection rule from the lower group of levels of excited configuration . </S>",
    "<S> their insignificant participation in the formation of spectrum is illustrated by figure [ tstrength ] , in which the total line strenghts from the given levels of initial configuration to all levels of final configuration are presented for co  vii @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of total line strengths differs essentially if all states are supposed to take equal part in the transitions ( all levels participate in proportion to their statistical weights ) . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of transitions from lower levels is rather strict .     </S>",
    "<S> distribution of the total line strengths for transitions from the levels of co  vii @xmath80 to all levels of @xmath81 : @xmath82 results of calculation in the single configuration intermediate coupling approximation ; @xmath83 total line strength taken to be proportional to the statistical weight of the initial level ( all states participate equally in the transitions ) . on the vertical axis the binding energies of levels of @xmath80 are indicated , in @xmath84.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the more significant violations of the rule @xmath85 may be caused by correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we have indicated above , some interconfiguration matrix elements in hp basis vanish , and it also concerns the fairly important mixing of configuration @xmath86 with @xmath87 .    therefore , the suppression of low energy transitions and the enhancement of the other transitions clearly manifest themselves in various experimental spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in figure [ expth ] the results of calculation in single configuration approximation of the radiative transition probabilities @xmath88 multiplied by the statistical weights @xmath89 are compared for co  viii with the data tabulated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both spectra have the same qualitative features . </S>",
    "<S> all strong lines are located on the high energy side of the spectrum and only a few weak lines are seen in the middle of the spectrum . experimentally only intensive lines from the upper group of levels are registered .     </S>",
    "<S> spectrum of radiative transitions for co  viii @xmath90 : @xmath82 reference @xcite ; @xmath83 results of calculation in single configuration approximation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath91 is the transition probability , @xmath92 is the statistical weight of the initial level . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom horizontal line in the ( a ) graph indicates the interval of available data and in the ( b ) graph the total interval of transition energies.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    let us consider briefly how the concentration of intensive lines on the high - energy side of the spectrum and the suppression of other lines depend on the number of electrons in the outer open shell . for this purpose we can use the shift of the average energy of emission spectrum (  @xmath93  ) with respect to the difference of average energies of initial (  @xmath94  ) and final (  @xmath95  ) configurations : @xmath96~.\\ ] ] the algebraic expression for this quantity , averaged with the weight equal to the square of the dipole transition amplitude , was obtained in @xcite .    for the transitions between two neighbouring shells with the same principal quantum number this shift </S>",
    "<S> is mainly determined by the coulomb dipole exchange interaction and can be approximated by the expression : @xmath97 g^1_k(nl , n(l+1))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 means the closed `` passive '' shells and @xmath99 is the slater exchange integral for the initial configuration @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the shift @xmath100 obtains the largest positive value at the smallest number of electrons in the open shell and decreases with increasing @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency is illustrated by the variation of spectra @xmath2 in the isonuclear sequence for the ions of co ( figure [ allco ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> upon filling the outer open @xmath102 shell the concentration of intensive lines on the high - energy side gradually diminishes and they spread within a larger part of the interval of possible transition energies . </S>",
    "<S> the similar variation of the spectra arising from the open @xmath103 and @xmath104 shells takes place for the sm isonuclear sequence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of the average energy of auger transitions ( [ eq7 ] ) shows that the enhancement of high - energy lines and suppression of low - energy lines are most pronounced at a small number of electrons in the outer shell @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore the formulated selection rule with respect to the number of vacancy - electron pairs can have a fairly wide application in the interpretation of various spectra . </S>"
