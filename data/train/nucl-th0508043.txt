    "study of photon spectra emanating from hot and dense matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is a field of considerable current interest .",
    "electromagnetic probes have been proposed to be the promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite .",
    "because of the very nature of their interactions photons and dileptons suffer minimum rescattering and therefore , can be used as efficient tools to extract the initial temperature of the system . by comparing the initial temperature with the transition temperature estimated from lattice qcd",
    ", one can infer whether quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed or not .    on the experimental side",
    "substantial progress has been made in measuring the transverse momentum spectrum of photons from nuclear collisions at super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the earlier results  @xcite phenix collaboration has analyzed the data by using a novel technique and reported  @xcite excess direct photons over the next to leading order perturbative qcd ( nlo pqcd ) processes for @xmath2 collisions at @xmath1 gev . the corresponding theoretical analysis of the data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in ref .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze the new experimental data and infer the initial temperature of the system formed after the collisions . the sensitivity of the results on various input parameters _",
    "e.g. _ transition temperature , strong coupling constant , equation of states etc have been presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the photon production rates from qgp and hot hadronic gas are discussed .",
    "the photons are produced from various reactions and decays taking place in an expanding medium .",
    "therefore , the static ( fixed temperature ) emission rates should be convoluted with the space time evolution of the system .",
    "the space time evolution of the system is outlined in section 3 .",
    "results of the calculations are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted for summary and discussions .",
    "let us identify the possible sources of `` excess '' photons above those coming from the decays of @xmath3 , @xmath4 mesons etc . as provided by the data .",
    "photons from the decays of @xmath3 , @xmath4 etc .",
    "are subtracted from the data and hence will not be discussed here . for the transverse momentum spectra of the photon , first we focus on the high @xmath5 domain .",
    "these are populated by the prompt photons originating from the hard collisions of initial state partons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "this is believed to be the domain where contributions can be estimated by pqcd .",
    "we use nlo predictions by gordon and vogelsang  @xcite from @xmath6 collisions and scale it up by the number of binary collisions for @xmath7 interactions to obtain the prompt contributions to the direct photons .",
    "it should be noted here that nlo prediction does not require any intrinsic @xmath8 smearing to explain the @xmath9 data  @xcite .",
    "this effect is ignored in the analysis of @xmath7 data in the present work .",
    "the fast quarks propagating through qgp lose energy due to gluon radiation and hence produce photons with reduced energy via fragmentation processes .",
    "this indicates that photon production by these processes will be suppressed .",
    "however , the induced emission of photons by the hard partons due to multiple scattering in the qgp will enhance the photon radiation .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the enhancement due to induced radiation compensates the suppression due to jet energy loss for the @xmath5 domain considered here .",
    "therefore , we ignore these mechanisms in the current analysis .",
    "photon production from the interaction of thermal gluons and non - thermal quarks was first considered in  @xcite within the framework of fokker planck equation .",
    "contributions from the hard partons undergoing annihilation and compton processes with the quarks and gluons in the thermal medium  @xcite have been evaluated and its importance has been highlighted recently .",
    "discussions on these contributions are beyond the scope of the present work ( see  @xcite for further details )",
    ". the duration of the pre - equilibrium stage will be small because thermalization time taken here is small ( @xmath10 fm ) and hence the contributions from this stage may be small .",
    "photons from the pre - equilibrium stage and hard - thermal conversion are neglected here .",
    "the fact that the current experimental data can be explained without these contributions indicate that theoretical uncertainties exist at present .",
    "the estimation of the thermal contribution depends on the space - time evolution scenario that one considers . in case of a deconfinement phase transition , which seems to be plausible at rhic energies ( see  @xcite for a review ) , one assumes that qgp is formed initially .",
    "the equilibrated plasma then expands , cools , and reverts back to hadronic matter and finally freezes out at a temperature @xmath11 120 mev .",
    "evidently there will also be thermal radiation from the luminous hadronic fireball which has to be evaluated properly in order to have a reliable estimate of the initial temperature .",
    "the photon emission rate from qgp due to compton ( @xmath12 ) and annihilation ( @xmath13 ) processes was evaluated  @xcite by using hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "later it was shown  @xcite that photon production from the reactions , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 contribute in the same order as annihilation and compton processes . however , this calculation does not incorporate suppression due to multiple scattering during the emission process .",
    "this point was later clarified in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the complete calculation of photon emission rate from qgp to order @xmath18 has been completed by resuming ladder diagrams in the effective theory  @xcite . we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the present work .",
    "the parameterizations of the emission rates for various processes are available in ref .",
    "the temperature dependence of the strong coupling constant is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    while evaluating the photons from hadronic phase we consider an exhaustive set of hadronic reactions and the radiative decay of higher resonance states  @xcite .",
    "the relevant reactions and decays for photon productions are : ( i ) @xmath19 , ( ii ) @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the intermediate state  @xcite ) , ( iii)@xmath26 and ( iv ) @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding vertices are obtained from various phenomenological lagrangians described in detail in ref .",
    "contributions from other decays , such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been found to be small  @xcite for @xmath35",
    "all the isospin combinations for the above reactions and decays have properly been taken into account .",
    "various experiments suggest that the spectral functions of hadrons are modified in a dense nuclear environment  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of lepton pair yield in ceres data  @xcite below the @xmath22-mass can only be explained by assuming the in - medium modifications of the @xmath22 meson  @xcite .",
    "the photon spectra measured by wa98 collaboration at cern - sps energies have been reproduced by assuming the reduction of hadronic masses in the thermal bath  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath5 distribution of photons changes significantly with a reduced mass scenario and is almost unaffected by the broadening  @xcite of the vector meson spectral function in the medium . on the other hand",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pairs is sensitive to both the reduction in vector meson masses  @xcite as well as the enhanced width of the vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "thus , by looking only at the dilepton spectra , it is difficult to differentiate the above scenarios . we need to analyze both the photon and dilepton spectra simultaneously .",
    "there is no consensus on the nature of the vector meson modification in matter - pole shift or broadening - both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the shift in hadronic spectral function depends on the temperature and ( baryonic ) chemical potential of the thermal bath created after the collisions .",
    "the value of baryonic chemical potential for system produced after the collision at @xmath1 gev is much smaller  @xcite compared to the other lower energy collisions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation of the nature of change observed in these low energy experiments to rhic energy may suffer from various uncertainties , because for matter formed at rhic collision the net baryon number is very small ( baryon - anti - baryon @xmath36 ) .",
    "because of these reasons and the insensitivities of photon spectra on broadening we consider the reduction of hadronic masses to evaluate photon productions from hadronic matter to estimate @xmath37 .",
    "the nature of changes in the hadronic spectral function at non - zero temperature and density is not known from first principle at present .",
    "thus one has to rely on calculations based on various phenomenological models ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",

    "br scaling has been used here to indicate how far the value of initial temperature is affected when the reduction of the hadronic mass is incorporated in evaluating the photon spectra .",
    "the br scaling indicates stronger reduction of hadronic masses as compared to quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite .",
    "as the abundances of hadrons increase with the reduction in their masses , photon yield is expected to increase from hadronic phase with br scaling .",
    "therefore , in this scenario a conservative estimate of the photons from qgp phase and hence a conservative value of the initial temperature is obtained . in this article",

    "the experimentally measured hadron multiplicity can be related to the initial temperature and thermalization time by the following equation  @xcite : t_i^3(b)_i=(b ) [ intemp ] where @xmath44 is the hadron ( predominantly pions ) multiplicity for a given impact parameter @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the radius of the system , @xmath47 is the initial thermalization time , @xmath48 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath49 is the degeneracy of the system created .",

    "the dependence of the @xmath5 distributions of hadrons on the initial temperature is rather weak for the @xmath5 values under consideration .",

    "a comment on the chemical freeze - out temperature is in order here . depending upon the scenarios ( see below ) considered here ,",

    "[ fig3 ] ) that the data can be reproduced with lower initial temperature , @xmath85 mev ( and hence larger thermalization time scale @xmath11 0.5 fm ) .",
