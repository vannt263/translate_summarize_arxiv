    "in the framework of the semiclassical theory of waves [ 1 - 5 ] , i.e. , short wavelength asymptotics , the uniform ( global ) description of the wavefield is complicated by the formation of caustic singularities [ 1 , 2 , 6 - 8 ] .",
    "although a complete and deep understanding of the wavefield structure near caustic regions is obtained on the basis of catastrophe theory @xcite and the unfolding of the corresponding singularities can be treated by means of symplectic techniques @xcite , the application of such methods to realistic cases , e.g. , to waves in magnetically confined plasmas @xcite , appears rather difficult .",
    "therefore , with specific regard to physical applications , several asymptotic methods have been developed which yield numerically tractable equations , though being limited concerning the global properties of the asymptotic solutions .",
    "such asymptotic techniques can be classified into two different families , depending on whether the relevant wave equation is described in the phase space , _ microlocal techniques _ , or directly in the configuration space where the wavefield is defined , _ quasi - optical methods_.    this work aims to give a detailed comparative analysis of two such techniques , namely , the wigner - weyl kinetic formalism [ 11 - 13 ] and the complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) method [ 14 - 17 ] which can be considered as benchmarks for microlocal and quasi - optical methods , respectively .",
    "specifically , in sec.2 , the wigner - weyl formalism and the complex geometrical optics method are reviewed and compared .",
    "in particular , it is pointed out that , within the wigner - weyl formalism , physically meaningful solutions should have a specific form , referred to as momentum distribution , which is characterized in sec.3 .    on the basis of the mathematical properties of momentum distributions ,",
    "our main result is obtained in sec.4 . in particular , it is shown that , in correspondence to appropriate boundary conditions , there exists a specific asymptotic solution of the wave kinetic equation relevant to the wigner - weyl formalism that can be written in terms of the corresponding solution of the complex geometrical optics equations .",
    "this allows us to relate the two considered methods as well as to determine the specific class of boundary conditions for which they are equivalent . in sec.5",
    ", this general result is illustrated by means of an analytically tractable example , i.e. , the propagation of a gaussian beam of electromagnetic waves in an isotropic `` lens - like '' medium . in conclusion ,",
    "a summary of the main results is given in sec.6 .",
    "in order to set up the framework , let us discuss the relevant boundary value problem for a generic _ scalar _ pseudodifferential wave equation , together with the required mathematical definitions .    specifically , we will consider the case of a scalar ( real or complex ) wavefield @xmath0 propagating in the @xmath1-dimensional linear space @xmath2 with @xmath3 a generic set of cartesian coordinates and denote by @xmath4 the corresponding coordinates in the dual space @xmath5 .",
    "time - dependent wavefields are included as one of the coordinates can play the role of time , e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 being a reference speed , and the corresponding dual coordinate is related to frequency , e.g. , @xmath8 . to some extent ,",
    "the results for a scalar wave equation are valid also for a multi - component wave equation as the latter can be reduced to a set of _ independent _ scalar equations far from mode conversion regions @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the wigner - weyl formalism will be formulated entirely in the space @xmath9 , with coordinates @xmath10 , which is viewed as the trivial cotangent bundle @xcite over the configuration space @xmath11 where the wavefield is defined .",
    "no explicit reference to the propagation direction is made , differently from the classical derivations @xcite .",
    "as for the cgo method , it has been originally developed for solving the second - order partial differential equation relevant to the propagation of electromagnetic wave beams in stationary spatially nondispersive media .",
    "hence , we will need to discuss its application to generic pseudodifferential equations .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the cgo method yields an approximation of the wavefield directly in the configuration space , provided that the wave equation satisfies an appropriate condition .",
    "first , let us define the class of wave equations undergone to solution .",
    "a pseudodifferential wave equation is an equation of the form @xmath12 which admits propagating wave solutions .",
    "the operator @xmath13 is a pseudodifferential operator [ 3,18 - 20 ] acting on the wavefield as a fourier integral operator @xcite characterized by the bilinear phase function @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 belongs to a particular class of smooth functions , referred to as _ symbols _ , which , roughly speaking , behave like a polynomial in @xmath16 for @xmath17 large enough .",
    "specifically , a smooth function @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a symbol of order @xmath21 if for every multi - indices @xmath22 , @xmath23 there is a constant @xmath24 such that @xmath25 . in virtue of the symbol estimate ( [ 2n ] )",
    "the integral in ( [ 1n ] ) makes sense for @xmath26 , the space of tempered distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scale length @xmath27 characterizes the variations of symbols with respect to the spatial coordinate @xmath28 and it can be eliminated by the rescaling @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth noting that any linear differential operator with smooth and bounded coefficients is a pseudodifferential operator @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions of cauchy type are given on an @xmath31-dimensional hypersurface @xmath32 : for simplicity , one can assume @xmath32 to be the hyperplane @xmath33 where the wavefield @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is assigned together with as many derivatives @xmath36 as appropriate .",
    "we are interested in semiclassical solutions for which only the covectors @xmath16 with @xmath37 are significant , in the integral in ( [ 1n ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the wavefield should be a highly oscillating function on the ( large ) scale length @xmath27 and it should correspond to a specific set of highly oscillating boundary conditions of the form @xmath38 the amplitude @xmath39 being slowly varying , that is , @xmath40 .      in the wigner - weyl formalism , the weyl - symbol map @xmath41 is applied in order to represent the wave equation ( [ 1n ] ) in @xmath42 which is naturally endowed with a phase - space structure .",
    "the weyl - symbol map transforms an operator @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the space of schwartz s functions @xcite , into a tempered distribution by acting on the schwartz kernel @xmath45 of the operator @xmath46 according to @xcite @xmath47 it is worth noting that for the pseudodifferential operator in ( [ 1n ] ) the schwartz kernel is @xmath48 thus , the image of @xmath13 under the weyl - symbol map amounts to the formal series of decreasing order symbols @xmath49 where taylor expansion has been used and @xmath50 .",
    "series of that kind admit always an asymptotic resummation @xcite to a symbol of order @xmath51 , @xmath52 which is referred to as _ weyl symbol _ of @xmath13 . in ( [ weyl ] )",
    "the @xmath53 denotes the asymptotic equivalence of symbols @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can consider the correlation operator @xcite @xmath54 whose schwartz kernel is given by the tensor product @xmath55 , then the weyl - symbol map yields the _ wigner function _ @xmath56    the wave equation ( [ 1n ] ) can be written in the equivalent form @xmath57 and , on applying the weyl - symbol map , one gets @xcite @xmath58 in the semiclassical limit one has @xmath59 so that , on assuming the same ordering for the wigner function @xcite , the foregoing equation separates into    [ 1.1 ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the real and imaginary parts of the weyl symbol ; in particular , one has @xmath63 which is the condition for weak absorption and/or instabilities @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 1.1a ] ) is a constraint to eq.([1.1b ] ) which , on the other hand , has the form of a kinetic equation in the @xmath64-@xmath16 phase space , @xmath65 being the corresponding poisson brackets .",
    "we will refer to the whole system ( [ 1.1 ] ) as the _ wave kinetic equation_.    in general , a solution of the wave kinetic equation is a tempered distribution , however , one usually restricts the class of solutions to semiclassical measures .",
    "this allows us to make sense of the integrals of the form @xcite @xmath66 which expresses the expectation value of a physical quantity represented by the pseudodifferential operator @xmath46 with weyl symbol @xmath67 . in the following",
    "we will assume further regularity with respect to @xmath64 so that the expectation values of physical quantities can be defined _ locally _ , that is ,    [ physics ] @xmath68 makes sense as a smooth function in @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , the wavefield intensity amounts to @xmath70 ) . on the hyperplane @xmath71 the wavefield @xmath34 has been assigned and one can compute the corresponding wigner function @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the correlation operator associated to @xmath74 and @xmath75 the coordinates dual to @xmath76 ; then a solution @xmath77 should match @xmath78 in some appropriate sense .",
    "specifically , one should impose that the local value @xmath79 of any physical quantity evaluated on @xmath32 is the same whether it is evaluated by @xmath77 or by @xmath78 . within this formulation",
    ", the weyl symbol @xmath67 should be restricted to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined .",
    "one can note that the suitable embeddings @xmath82 of @xmath80 into @xmath83 such that @xmath82 lies over @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath84 with @xmath85 the canonical projection @xcite , are of the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 a generic smooth function ; correspondingly , the restriction of a symbol is readily defined as @xmath88 . then the boundary value conditions read    [ 6n ] @xmath89 which is equivalent to @xmath90    the function @xmath91 can not be arbitrary as ( [ 6nb ] ) should satisfy the constraint ( [ 1.1a ] ) which reads @xmath92 hence , the appropriate functions @xmath91 are obtained on solving the so - called _ local dispersion relation _ evaluated on @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 has been assumed to be noncharacteristic , i.e. , @xmath93 on @xmath82 , the function @xmath91 is well defined and smooth at least locally , in view of the implicit function theorem . on the other hand , it is not unique since ( [ 7n ] ) may have multiple solutions , each one corresponding to a specific branch of the dispersion relation . in virtue of the superposition principle for linear wave equations ,",
    "the total wavefield is a linear superposition of the contributions from each branch of the dispersion relation , the coefficients being determined by the cauchy boundary values of the normal derivatives @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , one has a specific cauchy boundary value problem for the wigner function of each branch and the sum over all branches yields the total wigner function .",
    "since one has @xmath95 where the indices @xmath96 and @xmath97 run over all branches , and , on noting that the average @xmath98 over short scale oscillations cancels out the mixed terms , @xmath99 for @xmath100 , whereas @xmath101 , one gets @xmath102 that is , the projection of the total wigner function yields the _ averaged wavefield intensity _ and , thus , it does not account for , e.g. , the formation of short - scale diffraction patterns .",
    "let us now turn to the complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) method and , in particular , let us discuss its application to pseudodifferential wave equations .",
    "this is based on approximating the solution of ( [ 1n ] ) by a smooth wave function of the form @xmath103 where , according to the semiclassical limit , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "in addition to the standard oscillating exponential @xmath106 , the wave object ( [ 1.3 ] ) exhibits a novel scale length @xmath107 which accounts for intermediate - scales variations of the amplitude profile @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "in general , such an intermediate scalelength @xmath110 can be determined by both ( strong ) absorption @xcite and diffraction @xcite ; however , in this paper , it is assumed that the medium is weakly nondissipative [ cf .",
    "comments after equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) ] so that only diffraction effects are significant . the total short- and intermediate - scale variations of the wavefield",
    "are accounted for by the _ complex eikonal function _",
    "@xmath111 .    the relevant equations for the three unknown functions @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are determined on substituting the ansatz ( [ 1.3 ] ) into the wave equation ( [ 1n ] ) . for the specific case",
    "for which @xmath13 is a differential operator this is straightforward . on the other hand , for the general case ,",
    "one should deal with the nonlocal response of the operator @xcite . with this aim it is convenient writing ( [ 1n ] ) in the configuration space in terms of the schwartz kernel , namely , @xmath115 where the exact kernel has been replaced by the @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the weyl symbol .",
    "actually , one could make use of other symbol maps @xcite , yielding asymptotically equivalent results ; here the weyl - symbol maps has been chosen for direct comparison with the wigner - weyl approach .    let us further assume that the kernel @xmath118 amounts to a distribution smoothly dependent on @xmath119 and with compact support in @xmath120 . in virtue of the paley - wiener - schwartz theorem @xcite ,",
    "this is equivalent to assume that the corresponding weyl symbol @xmath121 extends to an _ entire _ function of the complex - valued dual vector @xmath122 , smoothly dependent on @xmath123 . from a physical standpoint",
    ", the foregoing assumption implies that nonlocal effects have a finite range : the response @xmath124 of the operator @xmath13 depends only on the value of the wavefield @xmath125 in a compact set .    within this condition , one can substitute the complex eikonal ansatz ( [ 1.3 ] ) into ( [ 1n ] ) and expand in taylor series with respect to @xmath126 .",
    "as a result one has @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 and , for the paley - wiener - schwartz theorem , the estimate @xmath129 is still valid for complex - extended symbols . to leading orders in @xmath130 , and for a weakly dissipative media ,",

    "it is worth noting that the foregoing equations can be formally obtained from the standard geometrical optics equations , e.g. , in the form given by littlejohn and flynn @xcite , by replacing @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "the cgo equations ( [ 11n ] ) have been dealt with both by means of the characteristics method in the complex domain @xcite and on expanding the equations with respect to @xmath137 @xcite . in particular , on referring to the latter approach , in the weak - diffraction regime @xmath138 , terms up to order @xmath139 should be considered in the cgo equation for the complex eikonal @xmath140 , which , after separating the real and imaginary parts , amounts to    [ 1.5 ] @xmath141 equations ( [ 1.5a ] ) and ( [ 1.5b ] ) constitute a set of coupled first - order partial differential equations for @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 . as for the complex amplitude @xmath146 ,",
    "only the lowest order approximation with respect to @xmath147 is significant , so that the real amplitude @xmath148 is decoupled from the phase @xmath149 $ ] ( not considered hereafter ) and determined by means of the transport equation @xmath150 = 2d '' \\big(x , k(x)\\big)\\ |u(x)|^{2}.\\ ] ]    this is formally the same equation as the geometrical optics transport equation @xcite , but diffraction effects are accounted for through the wavevector - field @xmath135 which differs from that obtained in the geometrical optics .",
    "the approximated form ( [ 1.5 ] ) of the cgo equations is the one used in physical applications .",
    "moreover , in the zero - diffraction regime ( @xmath151 ) , one has @xmath152 , thus terms up to first order only should be considered , with the result that equations ( [ 1.5a ] ) and ( [ 1.5b ] ) are decoupled and the whole set of cgo equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) reduces to the standard geometrical optics equations , @xmath113 being effectively zero .",
    "equations ( [ 1.5a ] ) and ( [ 1.5b ] ) are usually solved by computing the characteristic curves @xcite of ( [ 1.5a ] ) with ( [ 1.5b ] ) regarded as a constraint with the result that the characteristics curves thus obtained resemble the geometrical optics rays @xcite .",
    "therefore , the appropriate boundary conditions should be enough to determine the initial values of the complex vector @xmath153 evaluated on the boundary surface @xmath32 .",
    "such conditions are obtained from the cauchy data ( [ 1nbound ] ) on writing @xmath154 for some functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 such that @xmath157 and @xmath158 . from ( [ 12n ] ) one readily gets the value of the component of the complex vector @xmath159 tangent to @xmath32 , namely , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",

    "if multiple solutions are found , one should write the wavefield as a sum of contributions from each branch of the local dispersion relation .    from the foregoing discussion , one should note that the cgo method yields the solution directly in the configuration space , but one should deal with the set of partial differential equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) , the numerical solution of which can be rather cumbersome . although the characteristics technique can be used for eq.([1.5a ] ) , the constraint ( [ 1.5b ] ) should be solved in parallel , thus increasing the computational complexity of the problem . as for the global properties of the cgo solution , to our knowledge",
    "no general result is still available , though numerical solutions @xcite show that the cgo solution is regular even near focal points where the standard geometrical optics solution exhibits a caustic singularity .",
    "in contrast , the wigner - weyl formalism appears better suited for numerical solutions .",
    "in particular , the wave kinetic equation can be solved along the corresponding hamiltonian orbits in the phase space so that it is reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations that require limited computational efforts and the solution thus obtained has a global validity in the phase space since the hamiltonian orbits do not cross each other . in this respect ,",
    "the constraint ( [ 1.1a ] ) does not constitute a limitation as @xmath167 is a constant of motion .",
    "moreover , there is no limitation on the nonlocal response of pseudodifferential operators to which the wigner - weyl formalism applies . on the other hand",
    ", the solution in the phase space should be projected into the configuration space and , thus , an integral with respect to the momentum @xmath16 should be carried out numerically .    notwithstanding these differences , the wigner - weyl kinetic formalism and the complex geometrical optics method share a number of features , e.g. ,",
    "the solution of the local dispersion relation ( [ 14n ] ) relevant to the cgo method is obtained , to the lowest significant order in @xmath147 , on evaluating the corresponding solution ( [ 7n ] ) for @xmath172 . in the following sections",
    ", it will be proved that one can project the wave kinetic equation from the phase space into the configuration space in such a way that the cgo eq.([1.5 ] ) are recovered .",
    "as discussed in sec.2 , the solutions of the wave kinetic equation are usually sought in the space @xmath173 of tempered distributions @xcite , or in the space of semiclassical measures @xcite .",
    "the first formulation is the more general , whereas the second follows from the physical requirement that expectation values ( [ star ] ) are well defined .",
    "moreover , we have pointed out that , for general wave propagation problems , physics requires a stronger condition on the wigner function , namely , the expectation values of physical quantities should be locally defined according to ( [ starstar ] ) . for instance , if one deals with a time - dependent wavefield for which @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the integral @xmath176 yields the wave action density @xmath177 in the space - time @xcite .    in this section , a mathematical characterization of such novel solutions",
    "is given and the corresponding differential calculus is put forward .    first , let us note that for any schwartz function @xmath178 and for any tempered distribution @xmath179 one can define a tempered distribution @xmath180 over the configuration space only , given by @xmath181 where , in general , angle brackets and the integral are alternative ways to denote the action of a distribution on the corresponding test function .",
    "the distribution @xmath182 is smooth with respect to @xmath69 if and only if @xmath183 amounts to a smooth function @xmath184 . in this case",

    ", which instead gives the averaged intensity distribution .",
    "within the framework of semiclassical wave propagation , two specific asymptotic techniques have been considered , namely , the wigner - weyl kinetic formalism and the complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) method . a detailed comparative analysis of these techniques has been given in sec.2 , for the case of scalar pseudodifferential wave equations , with cauchy boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , in the wigner - weyl formalism , the wavefield is represented in the phase space by the wigner function which is a solution to the wave kinetic equation . in the most general case",
    "the wigner function amounts to a tempered distribution . however , physical considerations lead to the definition of a novel class of weak solutions which have been characterized in sec.3 .",
    "such specific weak solutions are referred to as _ momentum distributions _ since , for every point location @xmath64 in the configuration space , they give the distribution of momentum @xmath16 over @xmath64 , in the @xmath64-@xmath16 phase space .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cgo method yields an asymptotics solution of a pseudodifferential wave equation directly in the configuration space , in terms of three smoothly varying functions representing , the phase , the wavefield envelope and the amplitude , respectively .    in sec.4 , on the basis of the mathematical framework developed in sec.3",
    ", we have proved that , whenever both the solutions of the wave kinetic equation and of the cgo equations exist , thus , in particular , the cauchy data are of the form ( [ 22n ] ) , the former can be approximated by a momentum distribution , cf . , equation ( [ 21n ] ) , written in terms of the three smoothly varying functions that solve the cgo equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the two considered techniques are asymptotically equivalent and , in particular , to lowest significant order , the wavefield intensity predicted by the wigner - weyl formalism is the same as that predicted by the cgo method , cf .",
    "eq.([intensity ] ) .",
    "in addition , one can conclude that the wigner - weyl kinetic formalism properly describes the wavefield near focal points .",
    "this is also shown by comparing the solution of the kinetic equation to that of the cgo equations for a specific case , namely , the propagation of electromagnetic gaussian wave beams in an isotropic `` lens - like '' medium , cf .",
    "in particular , the relevant solution of the wave kinetic equation has been obtained on the basis of the analogy between the `` lens - like '' medium and the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
