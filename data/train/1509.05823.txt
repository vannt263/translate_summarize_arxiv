    ", we optimize the convergence rate of the quantum consensus over a quantum network with @xmath0 qudits . the main motivation for extending this problem from qubits to qudits is to show that the optimal convergence rate is independent of the value of @xmath1 in qudits . by expanding the density matrix in terms of the generalized gell - mann matrices ,",
