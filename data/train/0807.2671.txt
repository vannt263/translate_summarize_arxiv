    "these oscillations are not intrinsic features but are due to the fact that at @xmath4 the interstitial vortex lattice is perfectly ordered , so the interstitial vortices move in a coherent fashion as shown in fig .",
    "at depinning , the interstitial vortices are slowly moving through a periodic potential created by vortices that remain trapped at the pinning sites .",

    "2(a ) illustrates that the @xmath59 versus @xmath60 curve becomes linear again .",
    "we term this the moving locked ( ml ) phase , since the vortex motion is effectively locked along the pinning sites . when the vortices are rapidly moving , the pinning sites have the same effect as a flashing one - dimensional trough that channels the vortices @xcite .",
    "the vortices assume a smectic structure in the ml phase , since different rows have different numbers of vortices , resulting in the formation of aligned dislocations .",
    "the ml phase is essentially the same state found in square pinning arrays at high drives when @xmath96 @xcite .    in previous studies of square pinning arrays with strong",
    "pinning , the initial motion of the vortices for @xmath96 occurred in the form of one - dimensional channels between the vortices trapped at the pinning sites @xcite . in the honeycomb pinning array , similar flow occurs in the sb phase as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) . for @xmath97 in the honeycomb array ,",
    "the initial interstitial flow for depinning in the @xmath16 direction occurs via the flow of individual vortices in a zig - zag pattern around the pinned vortices .",
    "since there is no dimer ordering for these fillings , no transverse response occurs for @xmath97 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the interstitial vortices begin to form dimer states when two interstitial vortices are captured in a single large interstitial site .",
    "the dimers can lower their orientational energy by aligning with each other in both the ground state and the moving states .",
    "dimers can only remain aligned in the moving state if they are channeling along one of the symmetry axes of the pinning lattice .",
    "if the dimers were to move strictly in the @xmath16-direction , they would be forced directly into the pinned vortex in the pinning site to the right of each large interstitial site .",
    "this would destabilize the rodlike dimers .",
    "instead , the dimers maintain their integrity by moving along @xmath99 to the @xmath16-axis . within the moving state ,",
    "if one of the dimers were to move along @xmath100 while the remaining dimers were moving along @xmath101 , the two interstitial vortices comprising the first dimer would be forced close together , destabilizing the dimer state due to the repulsive vortex - vortex interactions . instead ,",
    "all of the dimers move in the same direction .",
    "the sb - r transition occurs when the combined forces on the pinned vortices from the external drive and the moving dimers are strong enough to depin the pinned vortices . at the closest approach in the @xmath16 direction between a dimer and a pinned vortex ,",
    "the frontmost dimer vortex is a distance @xmath102 from the pinned vortex and the rear dimer vortex is a distance @xmath103 from the pinned vortex , where @xmath104 is the lattice constant of the undiluted triangular pinning lattice .",
    "in addition to the force from the dimerized vortices , the pinned vortex experiences an opposing force from the neighboring pinned vortex a distance @xmath105 away . in a simple approximation ,",

    "setting @xmath5 gives @xmath107 , close to the value of @xmath108 for the sb - r transition in fig .",
    "the pinned vortices depin , the system enters the random ( r ) phase , and since @xmath60 is still considerably less than @xmath41 , it is possible for vortices to be pinned temporarily in phase r.    studies of square pinning arrays have shown that after the onset of a random dynamical phase , the vortices can organize into a more ordered phase of solitonlike pulse motion along the pinning rows , followed by a phase in which all of the vortices channel along the pinning rows @xcite . at the transition to the one - dimensional pulse like motion ,",
    "a larger fraction of the vortices are pinned compared to the random phase , so a drop in @xmath59 with increasing @xmath60 occurs , giving a negative differential conductivity . in the honeycomb pinning arrays for the parameters we have chosen here , we do not observe one - dimensional pulse motion or negative differential conductivity for driving along the @xmath16-direction .",
    "for the one - dimensional pulse motion or the ml phase motion seen in fig .",
    "3(e , f ) to occur , the vortices must be moving at a sufficiently high velocity for the pinning sites to act like a flashing trough .",
    "when the vortices move along the pinning rows , the vortex lattice structure adopts a highly anisotropic configuration which would be unstable at @xmath109 . during the period of time when a vortex passes through a pinning site",
    ", the vortex is pulled toward the center of the pinning row , which stabilizes the one - dimensional motion .",
    "when the vortex is moving between the pinning sites , it can drift away from the one - dimensional path until it encounters another pinning site . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that for square pinning arrays , increasing the pinning radius @xmath110 stabilized the one - dimensional flow down to lower values of @xmath91 . in the honeycomb pinning array ,",
    "the one - dimensional flow is less stable due to the fact that the vortices must move over the much wider large interstitial site , giving the vortices more time to drift away from the pinning row .",

    "in this case , the effective dimerization of the interstitial vortices would be shifted to higher magnetic fields .",
    "although true phase transitions are associated only with equilibrium phenomena , the nonequilibrium phases considered here have many analogies to equilibrium phases .",

    "for example , in colloidal systems , square pinning arrays with flat regions between the pinning sites ( muffin - tin potentials ) have been fabricated , and in these systems the interstitial colloids are much more mobile than in washboard - type pinning potentials .",

    ", the moving states can dynamically order into a broken symmetry state where the vortices flow with equal probability at either @xmath100 or @xmath101 to the @xmath16-axis . as the driving in the @xmath16-direction increases",
    ", there is a depinning transition for the vortices in the pinning sites , and the transverse response is lost when the vortices either flow in a random phase or channel along the pinning sites . as a function of pinning force",
    ", we find other types of vortex lattice ordering at zero driving , including a partially pinned lattice and a herringbone ordering of the dimers .",
    "these other orderings lead to new types of dynamical phases , including an elastic depinning for weak pinning where all the vortices depin simultaneously into a moving crystal phase , and an ordered interstitial flow in which the moving dimers break apart .",
    "the transitions between these flow phases appear as clear steps in the velocity force curves , and we have mapped the dynamical phase diagrams for various system parameters .",
    "we also showed that the different phases have distinct fluctuations and noise characteristics .",
    "when the temperature is high enough , the dimer states lose their orientational ordering and begin to rotate within the interstitial sites .",
    "this destroys the symmetry breaking flow ; however , the moving locked phase can still occur at high drives .",
    "the transition in the vortex ground state ordering as a function of pinning force causes the critical depinning force for driving in the @xmath16 and @xmath17-directions to differ . when driving along the @xmath17-direction , the initial depinning occurs in the form of one - dimensional interstitial channels , and at high drives the vortices can form an anisotropic moving locked phase .",
    "we find a large enhancement of the depinning force in the @xmath17-direction associated with the pinned herringbone phase when the dimers align in the @xmath16-direction and creates a jamming effect .",
    "the jammed state can enhance the critical depinning force by a factor of three , and can also arise for decreasing pinning size .",
