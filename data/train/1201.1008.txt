    "<S> we note that , as there is currently no theory on the lineshapes of three - body resonances , the fwhm is obtained from simple gaussian fits as used above . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening leads to a decrease in the height of the resonance , i.e. , a decrease in the formation rate of triply - occupied sites , and thus to a decrease in the overall loss rate . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this behavior in terms of the process discussed in ref.@xcite : fast three - body loss can suppress the formation of triply occupied sites , analogous to the suppression of inelastic two - body processes as reported in ref.@xcite for the case of weakly - bound molecules . </S>",
    "<S> as the three - body recombination rate scales like @xmath68 with the density @xmath69 , one would expect a strong increase of the three - body loss rate . </S>",

    "<S> in summary we have investigated a metastable mott insulating state with attractive interactions and have shown that this state exhibits a very long lifetime on the order of 10 seconds . by measuring excitation spectra we were able to determine the energies of two - body and three - body bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of the excitation resonance corresponding to the three - body bound state gives a strong indication that very high three - body recombination rates suppress the creation of triply occupied sites , thereby reducing the effective loss rate of the system , which also can be interpreted in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite with the three - body recombination rate playing the role of the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be used to realize a bose - hubbard model with a three - body hard - core constraint @xcite , leading to interesting many - body physics , including a dimer superfluid phase and a continuous supersolid phase for attractive bosons @xcite , the realization of pfaffian - like states in one - dimensional geometries @xcite , and the stabilization of an atomic color superfluid for fermions @xcite . </S>",
