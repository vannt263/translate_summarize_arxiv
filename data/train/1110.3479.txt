    "the dynamics of a quantum particle in a periodic environment is in many ways similar to that of a free particle , but when subject to a uniform force it does not accelerate indefinitely but performs periodic motion  bloch oscillations .",
    "this effect is often explained using interference of wannier - stark resonances , but can also be understood in terms of classical dynamics generated by an effective hamiltonian , where the kinetic term is replaced by the band dispersion  peierls substitution @xcite .",
    "the band dispersion is periodic so that the direction of the velocity , that is the gradient of the hamiltonian with respect to momentum , oscillates , and the classical trajectories generated by the effective hamiltonian are periodic .",
    "the high controllability and weak coupling to the environment of cold atom systems makes them ideal for observation of bloch oscillation @xcite .",
    "one of the experimental applications of cold - atom bloch oscillations has been force measurements , in particular of the acceleration of gravity @xcite , that has recently achieved @xmath0 accuracy .",
    "this application is based on a precise knowledge of the periodic potential and a large number of oscillation that enable an accurate measurement of the period .",
    "the experiments are carried out with very weakly interacting bose atoms to minimize dephasing .",
    "a cold - atom wave packet undergoing bloch oscillations in an optical lattice with an external force accumulates a dynamical phase during its propagation .",
    "the dynamical phase accumulates much faster than the oscillations phase , so that a single bloch oscillation yields a high - precision measurement of the external force .",
    "however , the measurement of a phase requires an interferometric setup . for this purpose",
    "we propose to use a narrow one dimensional potential barrier as a cold - atom wave packet splitter to form an interferometer with a mach - zehnder topology , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] .",
    "the auxiliary mirrors of optical mach - zehnder interferometers are not required here , since the trajectories in the two arms of the cold atom interferometer are curved , and naturally recombine .",
    "a tunnel barrier for cold atoms can be implemented by a narrow blue - detuned laser beam .",
    "coherent tunneling of bose - einstein condensates through a barrier significantly narrower than the spatial extent of the condensate has been used in experiments to study condensate dynamics in a double - well potential @xcite . here",
    "we propose to use the same technique in an optical lattice instead of a trap .",
    "the width of the barrier , equal to several lattice spacings , fits the requirements of the interferometer .",
    "the proposed setup is therefore as follows : a cold - atom wave packet is loaded adiabatically into an optical lattice with lattice spacing much shorter than the ( spatial ) wave packet width , so that only a single energy band is occupied .",
    "we assume that the band is non - degenerate and does not cross other bands .",
    "the atoms are also subject to a weak external force along a lattice direction .",
    "the wave packet is accelerated by an external force and impinges on a narrow potential barrier that is nearly perpendicular to the force direction ; it then splits , the wave packet fragments propagate in the two arms , and recombine in a second collision with the potential barrier .",
    "the interferometer structure is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] .",
    "high sensitivity is derived from the fast oscillations of the interferometer outputs as a function of the tilt angle of the tunnel barrier .",
    "the interferometer system relies on three small parameters .",
    "the principal parameter is @xmath1 , the ratio of the potential energy difference across a lattice unit divided by the energy band energy scale .",
    "the inequality @xmath2 guarantees the validity of the semiclassical approximation and provides the necessary scale separation between propagation and scattering in the operation of the interferometer .",
    "it is also essential for the interferometric sensitivity of the phase , since the accumulated phase difference in the two arms is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the second small parameter is @xmath4 , the ratio of the lattice spacing and the spatial uncertainty of the cold - atom wave packet .",
    "@xmath5 is necessary for the localization of the wave packet in a single band , while momentum localization requires that @xmath6 .",
    "the third small parameter is the lattice spacing divided by the width @xmath7 of the tunnel barrier .",
    "@xmath7 has to be much shorter than the wave packet width to prevent wave packet distortion during the scattering and much longer than @xmath8 to prevent band transitions .",
    "the setup conditions are therefore @xmath9    good visibility of the interference between the two wave packets in the outputs of the interferometer depends on phase - space overlap .",
    "time - reversal symmetry guarantees that the transmitted and reflected wave packets recombine at the beam splitter with full overlap after a complete bloch oscillation if the barrier is perpendicular to the force direction , _ regardless _ of the band dispersion ; it follows by continuity that there is significant overlap when the tilt angle @xmath10 of the beam splitter with respect to this direction is small enough .",
    "the population in the outputs exhibits fast oscillations as a function of @xmath10 with a period of order @xmath1 , shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttfcrr ] ) and figs .",
    "[ fig : output-1d ] and [ fig : output-2d ] .",
    "the range of @xmath10 with high visibility is of order @xmath11 for the optimal choice @xmath12 , so that the number of visible oscillation is large , @xmath13 . in the initial , constant visibility range of @xmath10 ,",
    "the oscillations are purely sinusoidal with a period determined by the initial momentum and the band dispersion , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oalpha - ex ] ) .    the wave packet motion in the arms of the interferometer is planar , undergoing bloch oscillations in one direction and free motion in the perpendicular direction .",
    "a 1d optical lattice is therefore required , with lattice axis along the direction of the external force .",
    "nevertheless , the interferometer operates equally well in a 2d lattice , and such operation offers additional probes , discussed below .",
    "since the 1d - lattice case is obtained as special case of the 2d one , we carry out the analysis for a 2d lattice , and present the 1d special case for the key results .",
    "the recombination of the wave packet occurs after a single bloch oscillation .",
    "however , the interferometer geometry implies that the wave packets propagating in the interferometer arms cross the barrier once also during the bloch period .",
    "the wave packets in general do not recombine during this intermediate crossing , so it is useless for the purpose of interferometry .",
    "a practical method of avoiding these spurious collisions and subsequent degradation of the interference pattern is to make the barrier potential time - dependent .",
    "the barrier potential needs to be maintained only during the initial and final collisions , and can be turned off during the intermediate crossing of the barrier , since these are well - separated in time .",
    "we will assume that this plan is carried out in our calculations and , for the sake of completeness , point out the modifications that arise if the barrier is time - independent .",
    "bloch oscillations are a wave phenomenon that is not particular to quantum mechanics .",
    "in addition to cold atoms systems they have been experimentally observed and studied in guided light systems @xcite .",
    "these systems are typically paraxial , and since the paraxial wave equation is identical to the schrdinger equation with the propagation direction playing the role of the time coordinate , the propagation of a quantum wave packet in a periodic potential and of a beam in wave guide array are described by the same analysis .",
    "this result also holds for the present study ; for concreteness we express all our results in cold atom terms , as it is the more natural application .",
    "in addition to the spatial interferometry considered here , waves propagating in a periodic medium can split and interfere in the band degree of freedom @xcite . instead of a tunnel barrier ,",
    "this requires a coupling between bands , possibly by landau - zener tunneling .",
    "this type of interference does not directly measure the external force unless the periodic structure is controlled .",
    "the interferometer operation is based on two building blocks : semiclassical wave packet propagation @xcite in the arms of the interferometer , that is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : wp ] , and quantum normal form analysis @xcite of the scattering of the wave packets off the tunnel barrier , that is the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : scat ] .",
    "the results of the wave packet propagation analysis and wave packet scattering are combined in sec .",
    "[ sec : int ] to yield expressions for the interferometer output as a function of the tilt angle . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cc ] we discuss applications of the interferometer force measurement and as a probe of the optical lattice structure .",
    "it is shown that the interferometer is experimentally realizable for a standard setup with gravity as the external force",
    "the propagation of the wave packets in the arms of the interferometer is governed by the combination of the optical lattice potential , and the external force @xmath14 directed along a lattice axis , that we choose as the @xmath15 axis , so that the single - atom hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the atom s position and momentum , respectively , and @xmath19 is the lattice potential .",
    "we assume that the inter - atom interactions are negligible , and that the many - atom state is a product of identical one - atom states    the optical lattice is either one- or two - dimensional . in either case , we suppose that the wave packet is fully supported in one of the energy bands of the ( unforced ) lattice potential whose energy dispersion is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the quasi - momentum , and measure energy in units of @xmath22 , the energy band width .",
    "if the optical lattice is one - dimensional then @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the one - dimensional dispersion , and @xmath25 is the @xmath26 component of the ordinary momentum .",
    "we assume that the energy band is nondegenerate and separated from the other bands by a gap of order @xmath22 .",
    "we also choose @xmath27 , where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing , as the unit of momentum , so that @xmath28 is periodic with period one in @xmath29 .",
    "the external force is weak , in the sense that @xmath30 . in the following",
    "we will write simply momentum instead of quasi - momentum , when there is no risk of confusion .",
    "the initial single - atom state @xmath31 is a wave packet with mean position @xmath32 and momentum @xmath33 and momentum uncertainty @xmath5 .",
    "it follows that the position uncertainty is much larger than @xmath8 . in explicit calculations we let @xmath31 be a gaussian wave packet with wavefunction @xmath34 .    under these conditions ,",
    "an effective classical dynamics can be applied as a systematic approximation for the propagation of the wave packet .",
    "an effective hamiltonian @xmath35 determines the in - band dynamics , derived from a semiclassical expansion in @xmath1 , whose leading term , peierls substitution @xcite , is obtained by replacing the kinetic term in the hamiltonian with the band dispersion , so that @xmath36 and letting @xmath37 and @xmath21 be canonically conjugate @xmath38=i\\hbar\\delta_{nm}$ ] .",
    "@xmath37 is a coarse - grained position observables with an uncertainty much larger than @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the optical lattice is space - reflection invariant in @xmath15 and @xmath26 , so that the sub - leading term in @xmath35 is @xmath39 and therefore negligible .",
    "the semiclassical propagation of the wave packet generated by @xmath35 consists of three elements , a phase - space drift along the classical trajectory of the center of the wave packet @xmath40 , a deformation ( squeezing ) of the wave packet by the linearized flow at the wave packet center , and an overall phase accumulation proportional to the classical action of the wave packet center trajectory @xcite .",
    "each part is realized as a unitary operator , so that the wave packet at time @xmath41 can be represented by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dynamical phase , @xmath44 is the heisenberg phase - space shift operator , and @xmath45 is the squeezing ( metaplectic ) operator derived from the symplectic phase - space deformation matrix @xmath46 with block components @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the problem is therefore reduced to the calculation of the classical trajectories of @xmath35 .",

    "the periodicity of @xmath28 implies that the wave packet performs bloch oscillations in the @xmath15 direction with period @xmath56 , while moving freely in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "it follows that the @xmath57 and @xmath58 blocks of the deformation matrix are unit matrices , the @xmath59 block is the zero matrix , and the elements of the @xmath60 block are @xmath61 the expression for the dynamical phase can be simplified to @xmath62    in our choice of units the coefficient @xmath63 , so that the classical limit , where @xmath64 keeping all classical quantities fixed , is equivalent here to the limit @xmath65 , and @xmath1 is the effective planck constant . in this limit the dynamical phase diverges , giving rise to the high interferometric sensitivity , as the small wavelength does in classical optical interferometry .",
    "the atom wave packet is split by tunneling through a one - dimensional potential barrier or a potential trench , that is , a modulation of the optical potential of the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the unit normal to the beam splitter , and @xmath68 is localized on a scale @xmath7 of magnitude @xmath69 .    for the purpose of analyzing the scattering of the wave packet by the beam splitter , we ignore temporarily the external force , and consider a standard scattering problem of an incoming unit amplitude plane wave with quasi - momentum @xmath21 in an energy band with dispersion @xmath28 , that splits into a transmitted wave with quasi - momentum @xmath21 with amplitude @xmath70 and a reflected wave with quasi - momentum @xmath71 with amplitude @xmath72 .",
    "the inequality @xmath73 guarantees that the scattered wave remains in the same energy band .",
    "lattice translation symmetry implies that tangential component of quasi - momentum is conserved , @xmath74 , and energy conservation implies that @xmath75 ; we assume that the band dispersion is such that there is a single solution @xmath71 , other than @xmath21 , to these two conditions .",
    "the initial quasi - momentum and wave packet splitter orientation define a classical band of allowed energies between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the condition @xmath73 also implies that unless @xmath78 is close to @xmath79 or @xmath80 is close to @xmath81 either @xmath82 or @xmath83 . for concreteness",
    "we choose to study scattering from a potential barrier and let @xmath84 so that both @xmath70 and @xmath72 are appreciable to obtain good interferometric visibility .",

    "the typical barrier maximum and dispersion minimum are quadratic , and under the conditions laid out above the scattering amplitudes are determined by local behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath68 near their extrema @xcite .",
    "denoting by @xmath87 and @xmath88 the abscissas of the extrema , we define the classical action @xmath89 and the standard theory of scattering from a parabolic barrier gives @xcite @xmath90    a scattering wave packet is a superposition of stationary scattering states @xmath91 .",
    "after the center of the incoming wave packet collides with the barrier it splits into a transmitted wave packet @xmath92 and a reflected wave packet @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the jacobian matrix of the reflection transformation . since the incoming wave packet is concentrated near @xmath33 , the transmitted wave packet is approximately @xmath95 but the dependence of the scattering amplitudes on @xmath21 causes a position - space shift and distortion of the wave packet . nevertheless , the shift and distortion are weak if the @xmath70 and @xmath72 do not change appreciably over the range of momenta that support the wave packet , or equivalently if the barrier width @xmath7 is much smaller than the position uncertainty @xmath96 @xcite , as we assume . in this case",
    "the position and momentum shifts incurred by the scattering are of @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( respectively ) , negligible in comparison with the respective uncertainties ; the relative deformation is even smaller , of @xmath99 .    by the same reasoning",
    "the reflected wave packet can be written as @xmath100 .",
    "since the momentum integration is localized , @xmath101 can be evaluated at @xmath33 , and the reflected momentum is approximately @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . the reflected wave packet is therefore @xmath104    finally we reconsider the effect of external force . in this case",
    "the quasi - momentum is no longer a good quantum number , so we label the stationary states by the value of @xmath21 at the barrier . these states are propagating in a large interval of @xmath105 size around the barrier and can therefore be used as a basis for a scattering theory for the wave packets considered here , with position uncertainty of @xmath106 . the preceding arguments and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tp][eq : ir ] ) are valid also with the weak uniform external force up to small corrections .",
    "the wave packet interferometry takes place in three steps . an initial wave packet @xmath31 of mean position @xmath32 and momentum @xmath33",
    "is first split by scattering from the wave packet splitter into a transmitted wave packet @xmath107 and a reflected wave packet @xmath108 with mean position @xmath32 and momentum @xmath109 .",
    "the transmitted wave packet then undergoes bloch oscillation in the @xmath15 direction and propagates freely in the @xmath26 direction before impinging on the beam splitter again at time @xmath110 and position @xmath111 with mean momentum @xmath112 .",
    "the wave packet @xmath113 then splits again into a transmitted - transmitted ( tt ) wavepacket @xmath114 at @xmath115 and @xmath116 and a transmitted - reflected ( tr ) wave packet @xmath117 at @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "the system has a mach - zehnder geometry with two outputs , one interfering tt with rr wave packets , and the other interfering tr with rt wave packets .",
    "the interferometer is sensitive to the difference between the dynamical phases accumulated by the transmitted and reflected wavepackets during their propagation .",
    "this phase difference changes fast as a function of the tilt angle @xmath10 between the beam splitter and the @xmath26 axis .",
    "we now calculate the interference pattern , concentrating from this point on the tt - rr output .",

    "the interference term takes the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 the phase of the interference term changes as a function of @xmath10 on a scale of @xmath1 , while the amplitude and the frequency of phase oscillations change more slowly .",

    "the interference patterns were calculated for two values of @xmath1 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the results presented in this subsection were derived under the assumption that the t and r wave packets do not scatter before the recombination event . since the trajectories of the wave packets in the interferometer arms cross the barrier line this requires temporal control of the barrier amplitude so that it vanishes at the intermediate crossing times of the t and r wave packets , and kept constant at the initial splitting time and final recombination times .",
    "if the barrier amplitude is not controlled temporally , further splitting would make the final state a superposition of six ( rather than four ) wave packets or more",

    "<S> we study the propagation of cold - atom wave packets in an interferometer with a mach - zehnder topology based on the dynamical phase of bloch oscillation in a weakly forced optical lattice with a narrow potential barrier that functions as a cold - atom wave packet splitter . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate analytically the atomic wave function , and show that the expected number of atoms in the two outputs of the interferometer oscillates rapidly as a function of the angle between the potential barrier and the forcing direction with period proportional to the external potential difference across a lattice spacing divided by the lattice band energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the interferometer can be used as a high precision force probe whose principle of operation is different from current interferometers based on the overall position of bloch oscillating wave packets . </S>"
