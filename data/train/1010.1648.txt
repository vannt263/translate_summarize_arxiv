    "in multiple - access communication , the evolution of user activity may play an important role . from one time instant to the next , some new users may become active and some existing users inactive , while parameters of the persisting users , such as power or location , may vary .",
    "now , most of the available multiuser detection ( mud ) theory is based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant , known at the receiver , and equal to the maximum number of users entitled to access the system  @xcite .",
    "if this assumption does not hold , the receiver may exhibit a serious performance loss  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the more realistic scenario in which the number of active users is unknown a priori , and varies with time with known statistics , is the basis of a new approach to detector design .",
    "this work presents a large - system analysis of this new type of detectors for code division multiple access ( cdma ) .",
    "our main goal is to determine the performance loss caused by the need for estimating the identities of active users , which are not known a priori . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to a worst - case scenario , where detection can not improve the performance from past experience due to a degeneration of the activity model ( for instance , assuming a markovian evolution of the number of active users @xcite ) into an independent process @xcite .",
    "the same analysis applies to systems where the input symbols accounting for data and activity are interleaved before detection . to prevent a loss of optimality",
    ", we assume that identities and data are estimated jointly , rather than in two separate steps .",
    "our interest is in randomly spread cdma system in terms of multiuser efficiency , whose natural dimensions ( number of users @xmath0 , and spreading gain @xmath1 ) tend to infinity , while their ratio ( the `` system load '' ) is kept fixed . in particular , we consider the optimal maximum a posteriori ( map ) multiuser detector , and use tools recently adopted from statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "of special relevance in our analysis is the decoupling principle introduced in  @xcite for randomly spread cdma .",
    "the general results derived from asymptotic analysis are validated by simulations run for a limited number of users  @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper focus on the degradation of multiuser efficiency when the uncertainty on the activity of the users grows and the snr is sufficiently large .",
    "we go one step beyond the application of the large - system decoupling principle @xcite and provide a new high - snr analysis on the space of fixed - point solutions showing explicitly its interplay with the system load for a non - uniform ternary and parameter - dependent input distribution . by expanding the minimum mean square error for large snr , we obtain tight closed - form bounds that describe the large cdma system as a function of the snr , the activity factor and the system load . in addition , some trade - off results between these quantities are derived . of special novelty here",
    "is the study of the impact of the activity factor in the cdma performance measures ( minimum mean - square error , and multiuser efficiency ) . in particular , we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of single or multiple fixed - point solutions as a function of the system load and snr .",
    "finally , we analytically identify the region of  meaningful \" multiuser efficiency solutions with their associated maximum system loads , and derive consequences for engineering problems of practical interest .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . section  [ section : model ] introduces the system model and the main notations used throughout .",

    "we consider a cdma system with an unknown number of users  @xcite , and examine the optimum user - and - data detector .",
    "in particular , we study randomly spread direct - sequence ( ds ) cdma with a maximum of @xmath0 active users : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the received signal at time @xmath4 , @xmath1 is the length of the spreading sequences , @xmath5 is the matrix of the sequences , @xmath6 is the diagonal matrix of the users signal amplitudes , @xmath7 is the users data vector , and @xmath8 is an additive white gaussian noise vector with i.i.d .  entries @xmath9 .",
    "we define the system s activity rate as @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "active users employ binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) with equal probabilities .",
    "this scheme is equivalent to one where each user transmits a ternary constellation @xmath12 with probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we define the maximum system load as @xmath15 .    in a static channel model ,",
    "the detector operation remains invariant along a data frame , indexed by @xmath4 , but we often omit this time index for the sake of simplicity . assuming that the receiver knows @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the a posteriori probability ( app ) of the transmitted data has the form @xmath18 hence , the maximum a posteriori ( map ) joint activity - and - data multiuser detector solves @xmath19 similarly , optimum detection of single - user data and activity is obtained by marginalizing over the undesired users as follows : @xmath20      in a communication scheme such as the one modeled by  , the goal of the multiuser detector is to infer the information - bearing symbols given the received signal @xmath21 and the knowledge about the channel state .",
    "this leads naturally to the choice of the partition function @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding free energy , normalized by the number of users becomes @xcite @xmath23 to calculate this expression we make the self - averaging assumption , which states that the randomness of   vanishes as @xmath24 .",
    "this is tantamount to saying that the free energy per user @xmath25 converges in probability to its expected value over the distribution of the random variables @xmath21 and @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath26 evaluation of   is made possible by the _ replica method _ @xcite , which consists of introducing @xmath27 independent replicas of the input variables , with corresponding density @xmath28 , and computing @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30    to compute , one of the cornerstones in large deviation theorem , the varadhan s theorem  @xcite , is invoked to transform the calculation of the limiting free energy into a simplified optimization problem , whose solution is assumed to exhibit symmetry among its replicas .",
    "more specifically , in the case of a map individually optimum detector , the optimization yields a fixed - point equation , whose unknown is a single operational macroscopic parameter , which is claimed to be the multiuser efficiency of an equivalent gaussian channel  @xcite . due to the structure of the optimization problem",
    ", the multiuser efficiency must minimize the free energy .",

    "the replica method is known to accurately approximate experimental data and is consistent with previous theoretical work  @xcite .",
    "the replica method analysis relies on four unproved assumptions : i ) the self - averaging property of the free energy , ii ) the replica symmetry of the fixed - point solution , iii ) the exchange of order of limits and iv ) the analytic continuation of the replica exponent to real values .",
    "although the validation of the mathematical rigor of these assumptions is still an unsolved problem , there has been some recent progress in this direction  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate here the behavior of multiuser efficiency and system load in the high - snr region corresponding to detection with an unknown number of users .",
    "we start by shaping our problem into the statistical - physics framework  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the multiuser detector metric is regarded as the energy of a system of particles at state @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the partition function @xmath45 corresponds to the output density given the channel information , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "the energy operator @xmath47 , as derived from the free energy , is related to the logarithm of the joint distribution @xmath48 : @xmath49    we can now invoke the decoupling principle ( claim [ thm0 ] ) in the multiuser system  , so as to use its single - user characterization . by doing this ,",
    "the system s performance can be characterized by that of a bank of @xmath0 scalar gaussian channels  , where @xmath0 represents the maximum number of users .",
    "the input distribution for an arbitrary bpsk user @xmath50 takes values @xmath51 with probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , the signal amplitudes from matrix @xmath17 are assumed to be constant , i.e , @xmath54 @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the snr per active user ( referred to as snr ) , and the inverse noise variance is equal to the multiuser efficiency @xmath36 .",
    "hence , @xmath36 is the solution of the fixed - point equation   that minimizes  , where the mmse is given by  .",
    "more generally , the analysis presented in this paper can be easily extended to @xmath57 coefficients with different statistics , like for example those induced by rayleigh fading .    by applying claim [ thm0 ] @xcite which holds under the assumptions of the replica method , the fixed - point equation of the user - and - data detector",
    "can be stated as follows :    [ thm1 ] given a randomly spread ds - cdma system with constant equal power per user , the large - system multiuser efficiency of an individually optimum detector that performs map estimation of users identities and their data under bpsk transmission is the solution of the following fixed - point equation @xmath58\\right)}\\ ] ] that minimizes the free energy .",
    "see appendix [ app : proof_mmse ] .    [ !",
    "htbp ]     and @xmath59=3/7 . ]",
    "our approach differs from that in  @xcite , as the fixed - point equation   also includes the prior distribution on the users activity in a static channel . under map estimation",
    ", detection requires the knowledge not only of the prior information of the data , but also of the activity rate @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the fixed - point equations depend on mmse , snr , and system load . numerical solutions vs.  snr at a load @xmath61 are shown in fig .",
    "plots like this one illustrate how the multiuser efficiency is affected by the level of noise and interference , and by the uncertainty in the users activity rate . for low snr , noise dominates , and the performance of the mmse and the multiuser efficiency is degraded as @xmath60 grows , since the presence of more active users adds more noise to the system .",
    "on the other hand , as we shall discuss later , for high snr the mmse strongly depends on the minimum distance between the transmitted symbols , and the activity rate here plays a secondary role .",
    "hence , the gap between the multiuser efficiencies with @xmath62 and @xmath63 for larger snr is due to the fact that the former constellation has twice the minimum distance of the latter .",
    "we can observe clearly the transition behavior from low to high snr for values of @xmath60 approaching @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath62 , reduces to the fixed - point equation for the classical assumption , in which all users are active and transmit a binary antipodal constellation  @xcite : @xmath65\\right).\\ ] ] in this case , it can be shown that , for high snr , we have @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the following general result holds :    [ lem1 ] @xcite for large output snr , the mmse of a system transmitting an equiprobable @xmath67-ary normalized constellation with minimum euclidean distance @xmath68 in a gaussian channel with noise variance @xmath69 is @xmath70 with @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a constant , given by the maximum distance between neighboring symbols .    for the entire range of activity rates ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath74 $ ] , we can derive lower and upper bounds illustrating analytically the transition between the classical assumption ( @xmath62 ) and the cases where the activity is also detected ( @xmath75 ) for large snr .",
    "our calculations bring about a new analytical framework to deal with large - system analysis , as we will see in the next section .",
    "our bounds are consistent with lemma  [ lem1 ] and the lower bound includes the case @xmath62 .",
    "the general result is stated as follows .",
    "[ thm2 ] the mmse of joint user identification and data detection in a large system with an unknown number of users has the following behavior , valid for sufficiently large values of the product @xmath76 : @xmath77    see appendix [ app : proof_mmse_limits ] .",
    "bounds in describe explicitly , in the high - snr region , the relationship between the mmse , the users activity rate , and the effective snr ( @xmath76 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] these bounds are compared to the true mmse values as a function of @xmath76 for fixed @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen that the uncertainty about the users activity modifies substantially the exponential decay of the mmse for high snr .",
    "in fact , a value of @xmath60 different from @xmath64 causes the mmse to decay by @xmath78 , rather than by @xmath79 , which would be the case when all users are active .",
    "furthermore , we can observe that , for sufficiently large effective snr , the behavior vs. @xmath60 of the optimal detector is symmetric with respect to @xmath80 , which corresponds to the maximum uncertainty of the activity rate .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that for large values of the product @xmath76 , the mmse essentially depends on the minimum distance between the inactivity symbol @xmath81 and the data symbols @xmath82 , and thus users identification prevails over data detection .",
    "summarizing , the dependence of the mmse must be symmetrical with respect to @xmath80 , since it reflects the impact of prior knowledge about the user s activity into the estimation .",

    "recall the definition of maximum system load @xmath83 , where @xmath0 is the maximum number of users accessing the multiuser channel . when the number of active users is unknown , and there is a priori knowledge of the activity rate , the actual system load is @xmath84 . in this section ,",
    "we focus on @xmath59 and study some of its properties .",
    "notice that , given an activity rate , results for the actual system load follow trivially .",
    "we characterize the behavior of the maximum system load subject to quality - of - service constraints .",

    "these solutions correspond to the solutions appearing in any simple mathematical model of magnetism based on the evaluation of the free energy with the fixed - point method  @xcite .",

    "solutions @xmath87 and @xmath88 are stable : one of them is globally stable ( it actually minimizes the free energy ) , whereas the other is metastable , and a local minimum .",
    "solution @xmath89 is always unstable , since it is is a local maximum .",
    "the `` true '' solution is therefore given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for which the free energy is a minimum .",
    "the same consideration applies also to our multiuser detection problem where multiuser efficiencies for the io detector might vary significantly depending on the value of the system load and snr .",
    "more specifically , for sufficiently large snr , stable solutions may switch between a region that approaches the single - user performance ( @xmath90 ) and a region approaching the worst performance ( @xmath91 ) , for @xmath92 .",
    "following previous literature  @xcite , we shall call the former solutions _ good _ and the latter _",
    "bad_. when the solution is unique , due to low or high system load , the multiuser efficiency is a globally stable solution that lies in either the good or the bad solution region .",
    "then , for given system parameters , the set of _ operational _ ( or globally stable ) solutions is formed by solutions that are part of these sets and minimize the free energy .    the existence of good and bad solutions are critical in our problem . from a computational perspective , we are particularly interested in single solutions , either bad or good , that surely avoid metastability and instability .",
    "these solutions belong to a specific subregion within the bad and good regions , and appear for low and high snr , respectively . from an information - theoretic perspective , it might seem that the true solutions should capture all our attention .",
    "however , it has been shown that metastable solutions appear in suboptimal belief - propagation - based multiuser detectors , where the system is easily attracted into the bad solutions region ( corresponding to low multiuser efficiency ) , due to initial configurations that are far from the true solution  @xcite .",

    "we have analyzed multiuser detectors for cdma where the fraction of active users is unknown , and must be estimated in a tracking phase . using a large - system approach and statistical - physics tools , we have derived a fixed - point equation for the optimal user - and - data detector , and provided asymptotic bounds for the corresponding mmse .",
