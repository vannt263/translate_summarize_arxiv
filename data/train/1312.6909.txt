    "the mode switching effect have been observed experimentally in the gas lasers @xcite , in the dye lasers @xcite and in the nd - yag laser @xcite .",
    "frequency detuning between the center of active - media gain spectrum and the resonator - mode frequency is a very important parameter for the mode switching effect in the two - level active media . for large enough frequency",
    "detuning the unidirectional regime becames unstable and superseded by the mode switching regime @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to achieve the mode switching even when the frequency detuning is too small to induce it .",
    "this can be achieved by adding an external optical feedback as illustrated in fig .",

    "we consider just two counterpropagating modes : `` plus- '' and `` minus - mode '' with the same frequency @xmath0 .",

    "the model equation of such a laser was written using a common semiconductor ring - laser equations @xcite .",
    "the second space harmonic of the population inversion was not considered because of a large carriers diffusion . as a result",
    ", some interesting dynamical effects ( even the chaotic behavior ) was obtained , except for the mode switching due to the optical feedback @xcite . in this paper the equation of the ring laser with delayed optical feedback will be obtained from the first principles taking in account the second space harmonica . as it will be shown below , this equations",
    "coincide with that from @xcite for the high carrier diffusion .",
    "when the diffusion is small as it is in the case of gas laser or quantum dot semiconductor laser , the mode switching effect could be achieved by the adding of the external delayed optical feedback .",
    "the device with external delayed optical feedback does not described by the common semi - classical laser equations @xcite and first of all we should derive the proper equations . the laser semi - classical equation ( with notation from @xcite )",
    "can be written as    [ 1eq : poln ] @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the electric field expanded in the modes of resonators @xmath5 , where index j takes values of all mode numbers .",

    "the symbol @xmath17 means the steady value of @xmath10 for the zero fields ( @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ) .    to explain the derivation of the equations with the delay optical feedback ,",
    "let us consider the simplest case : a single mode system without am active medium .",
    "let us suppose that there are external independent fields exciting the resonator mode .",
    "this fields @xmath20 satisfy the wave equation in free space @xmath21 .",
    "the resonator is a `` perturbation@xmath22 of the free space .",
    "the spatial part @xmath23 of a single mode field @xmath24 in the resonator satisfies the equation @xmath25 . in an open resonator @xmath26",
    "should be a complex number , but it is not significant . our purpose is to obtain the solution of the total equation @xmath27 with the ' ' boundary condition@xmath22 that the field far from the resonator is @xmath28 .",
    "so , let us look for the total solution in the approximate form @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the only unknown function . using all conditions mentioned above and the @xmath31 normalization @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this expression is equivalent to the linear oscillator equation with an external force .",
    "the next step is to exclude the second time derivation .",
    "we suppose the external force to be almost in the resonance @xmath35 . if the external field has the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a slowly varying function , we can write @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is a slowly varying function . using the slow variation of functions and assuming @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 one obtains @xmath43 .",
    "so , the external force leads to the simple summand in the right part .",
    "the similar calculations for the two coupled modes with the active medium @xcite leads to the modified form of ( [ 1eq : poln ] ) .",
    "after some mathematical transformation that are similar to that in @xcite one obtains :    @xmath44    @xmath45 @xmath46    @xmath47    here w - is a small coupling parameter , @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is a dipole moment .",

    "note that the energy that returns back to the resonator over the feedback was taken from one of the resonators modes .",
    "this losses should be taken into account in the @xmath11 constants .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) describes the main types of ring lasers with the delayed optical feedback .",
    "it is the main equations of the paper and all the following are based on them .",
    "if one neglects the delayed feedback ( @xmath64 ) , the equations ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) reduce to that from @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the common semiconductor laser the diffusion coefficient is large @xmath65 and the spatial harmonica @xmath66 could be adiabatically excluded .",
    "assuming @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 and the equations ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) became similar to the equations from @xcite .",
    "however , there is a difference between them in the terms like @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that we neglected the possible dependence of constants in ( [ 1eq : poln ] ) from the light intensity.we also neglected the non delayed backscattering .",
    "both effects are not very significant for the mode switching effect .",
    "the numerical solutions of ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) for the @xmath71 laser with typical parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and different @xmath76 are represented in the fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] . according to @xcite @xmath77",
    ", so there is no mode switching without external feedback(@xmath64 )    it is shown in the pictures , for a small feedback strength @xmath78 the unidirectional steady state solution is stable . for the critical value of the feedback strength @xmath79 this solution loses stability and a complex chaotic behavior is observed.there is the stable mode switching regime in the system when the feedback strength is high enough ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the pattern \" unidirectional solution - chaotic behavior - stable mode switching@xmath22 is the typical pattern for the growing w and the different parameter values .",
    "the chaotic behavior is observed in a narrow range of @xmath76 .",
    "however , the behavior of the system is very complex and we do nt claim for it total investigation .",
    "now our purpose is to find the formula for the feedback strength @xmath81 that force the laser to operate in a mode switching regime . as it can be seen from above , @xmath81 has the numerical value close to @xmath82 wherein the unidirectional solution loses it stability @xmath83 .    to find @xmath82",
    "we shall investigate the stability of the unidirectional solution of the equations ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) .",
    "these equations are not the common nonlinear differential equations but the differential equations with a deviating argument",
    ". this type of equations is scantily studied , but the solution - stability problem was discussed in great details ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath82 is represented in appendix [ appwcalc ] and the approximate upper bound for the @xmath82 is @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath88 the expression is simplified : @xmath89 guaranteed that the steady unidirectional solution lose its stability .",
    "the accuracy of ( [ eq : result ] ) was checked by comparison of the values @xmath82 and `` stable switching '' strength @xmath81 obtained by the accurate numerical solution of ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) with the corresponding value @xmath82 obtained from ( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "the results are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : table ]    the interesting feature of this formula is that when @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "it means that even when there is no frequency detuning , the mode switching regime is possible . in physical parameters described after ( [ 1eq : poln ] ) this inequality is    @xmath92    for @xmath90 . for the semiconductor laser with quantum dots ( without carrier diffusion and detuning ) @xmath93 ; @xmath94 ; @xmath95 ; @xmath96 , @xcite and the formula ( [ eq : result ] ) gives @xmath97 .",
    "thus , only 7@xmath98 of the leaking energy have to be coupled to the opposite mode .",
    "this gives a hope that the effect could be observers in such lasers .",
    "in this paper the equations describing the ring resonator with the delayed external optical feedback ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) was obtained .",
    "the numerical study of these equations shows that a weak external delayed optical feedback is enough to induce the mode switching effect . the analytical formula for the critical value of the feedback strength ( [ eq : result ] )",
    "was obtained and the comparation with the numerical solutions shows the correctness of the formula ( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "this formula could be applied to the semiconductor ring lasers with quantum dots , if one put @xmath90 .",
    "the calculation shows that it is theoretically possible to obtain mode switching effect in such lasers .",
    "the equations of the model ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) have a very complicated behavior and reveal the different non trivial effects , but we do not claim for the full classification of these effects . for instance the solution could depend on the initial conditions .",
    "so , there are some different attractors in the system and each of them forms a basin of attraction .",
    "some kind of `` period doubling '' effect was observed when the feedback force becomes strong @xmath99 , etcetera .",
    "the author would like to thank a.m. monakhov for the useful discussions .",
    "first of all , let us rewrite the eqations ( [ eq : osn_zader ] ) in real numbers . making the replacment @xmath100 ; @xmath101 ; @xmath102 , one obtains :                  here @xmath110;@xmath111 and @xmath112 . generally , the constant @xmath76 is a complex number , but here we assume it real . for our purposes",
    "it is enough .",
    "the modules could be steady only if the phases satisfy the equality @xmath113 , where @xmath114 are constants , @xmath115 is an unknown constant , and the phase @xmath116 is a constant too .",
    "the unidirectional steady state in the linear approximation in @xmath76 is      the steady - state phase equalities have a simple physical meaning .",
    "the relation @xmath123 is equivalent to @xmath124 .",
    "it means that the standing wave formed by counterpropogating modes , burns the population inversion grating , so the second space harmonica @xmath125 is shifted in phase on @xmath126 relatively to the standing wave .      to find",
    "the stationary value of @xmath131 approximately is incorrect when @xmath132 .",
    "it is a problem , because @xmath82 is a rapidly oscillating function of the @xmath133 .",
    "so , to obtain the upper bound of @xmath82 , one can slightly change the @xmath59 to the nearest @xmath134 corresponding to the local maximum of @xmath135    to suppress the mode switching , the standing wave formed by the delayed counterpropogating modes should be in the phase with the grating burned by the non delayed standing wave .",
    "in other words @xmath136 , i.e. the phase shift is zero . using this condition and another steady state conditions , one obtains @xmath137 , where @xmath138 .",
    "where @xmath146 ; @xmath147 ; @xmath148 ; @xmath149 these equations are a long - studied linear delayed equation @xcite .",
    "we shall look for the solution having the form @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a seven - dimensional constant vector , and @xmath152 is a constant . for that purpose",
    "it is necessary to solve the algebraic equation for the determinant , just as for common linear equations . for the delayed differential equations this algebraic characteristic equation is quasi - polynomial and has the form @xmath153 accurate to @xmath154 . here",
    "@xmath155 are polynoms , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "it is known that the steady point of nonlinear equation is stable if and only if the linearizated equation have only the decreasing solutions ( @xmath158<0 $ ] for all @xmath152 ) . in the physically - interesting systems",
    "@xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath86 . the case without",
    "external feedback @xcite corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "then ( [ eq : quasi polinom ] ) has @xmath158<0 $ ] for @xmath161 .",
    "it will be shown that the feedback force necessary for switching is decrease to zero when @xmath162 , so @xmath163 and @xmath164 have the same order of smallness .",
    "the values @xmath165 and @xmath164 have the same order of smallness too because @xmath166 for w=0.the series expansion in parameters @xmath164 and @xmath163 shows that @xmath167 .          in the case",
    "@xmath172 it is incorrect to use the standard perturbation theory with a small parameter @xmath154 to solve this algebraic equation , because of the fast oscillation of the small correction @xmath173 .",
    "thats why we used special method described in appendix [ appreshbosc ] .",
    "to explain the solution method of the equation ( [ eq : quasi polinom_simple ] ) , let us consider the simple equation @xmath174 , where @xmath175 , so @xmath176 is a fast - oscillating function .",
    "this equation has no roots @xmath177 , for @xmath178 . if @xmath175 the maximum root @xmath179 satisfies the equation @xmath180 .",
    "the principal idea here is to substitute the fast oscillating function by its envelope .    as a bit more complicated example",
    ", we consider the equation @xmath181 for the complex p. here @xmath182 ,",
    "@xmath172 , @xmath183 .",
    "the formulation of this problem is completely analogous to ( [ eq : quasi polinom ] ) .    for @xmath64",
    "this equation has two roots with a negative real part .",
    "our purpose is to find the value of @xmath82 , when the real part becomes zero .",
    "it means that p has the form @xmath184 , where q is a real number , so the equation can be rewritten as @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
