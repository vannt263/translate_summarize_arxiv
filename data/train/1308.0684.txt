    "the red giant arcturus ( @xmath4 boo , k2iii ) is one of the brightest star on the sky .",
    "it is interesting for studying , because its mass is close to the mass of sun , but arcturus is at the later stage of evolution out of the main sequence . in some sense arcturus",
    "represents the future of our sun .",
    "arcturus is known as an excellent reference star for spectroscopic studies of red giants , therefore availability precise atmospheric parameters for this star is very important .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of arcturus have been estimated by several investigators using a variety of techniques , for example , the pastel database of stellar parameters by soubiran et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , lists 28 entries for arcturus .",
    "+ one of the common problems in the investigations of the cool stars is the difficulties of the estimations of the surface gravity .",
    "balmer lines in the spectra of such stars are sensitive to changes of @xmath5 but not to @xmath6 . in such case",
    "it s possible to use lines of some moleculas , which are sensitive to @xmath6 changes .",
    "mgh is suitable for this purpose , but we need to know an abundances of magnesium and hydrogen , because mgh lines are very sensitive to them . in such case",
    "we must search the self - consistent solution for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and abundance of mg and h using the iteration method @xcite .",
    "+ at least three different mgh line lists are known at the present ( lists by yadin at al .",
    "@xcite , weck et al .",
    "@xcite , kurucz @xcite ) .",
    "some of them describe spectra well , others - not . in our work",
    "we used mgh line list by r. kurucz @xcite , which is very suitable for describing the spectrum .",
    "+ we investigated a few tasks here : can we use mgh lines to refine @xmath6 and effective temperature of arcturus ?",
    "how do mgh lines in the spectrum of arcturus depend on @xmath6 ? how do mgh lines in the spectrum of arcturus depend on @xmath5 ?",
    "we computed 28 model atmospheres with different @xmath6 and @xmath5 : @xmath6 ( 0.75 - 2.25 ) with the step 0.25 , @xmath5 ( 4200 - 4500 k ) with the step 100 by sam12 program ( pavlenko , 2003 ) @xcite .",
    "we computed synthetic spectrum of arcturus by wita6 @xcite .",
    "line list data were taken from database of atomic absorption spectra vald ( kupka et al . 1999 ) , observed spectrum from visible and near infrared atlas of the arcturus spectrum by hinkle et al @xcite .",
    "for the first approach we used chemical composition found by pdk .",
    "we accounted smoothing of the spectra of the instrumental profile , see fig .",
    "we chose 23 `` good '' mgh features , which consist of more less clean ( without atomic lines ) mgh lines .",
    "then we compared observed spectrum and computed synthetic spectrum of arcturus . in order to do that , we computed deviation s between our mgh features in theoretical and observed spectra for all grid of the models , see formulas ( [ form1 ] ) .    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the number of points in the feature , + @xmath9 is number of features , + @xmath10 is a deviation for one of features , + @xmath11 is total deviation for the model atmosphere with some @xmath12 and @xmath5 , + @xmath13 and @xmath14 are boundary wavelengths of mgh feature .",
    "+    the example of reseived dependence of residual flux on @xmath6 for one of 23 chosen lines is present on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( here @xmath5 is a constatnt and @xmath1 ) .",
    "arrows on the plots show borders of the feature @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the results of the s value computations for all 23 lines in the case @xmath1 are shown in table  [ tab1 ] , and fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    ".dependence of deviation on @xmath6 for @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     3d visualization of the dependences of @xmath11 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is on the plot ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , we can find the min @xmath11 around @xmath0 for @xmath1 . here",
    "is exist clearly visible degeneration of @xmath11(@xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath6 can be determined if @xmath5 is fixed by any other method . as bell at al .",
    "( 1985 ) noted , a dominant source of errors of determination of log g using mgh lines is the error in @xmath5 .",
    "+ the comparison of our result with results of other studies taken from the catalog soubiran et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is present on the plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the line on the plot is the projection of minimums @xmath11 on the plane @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 , this line can be used as calibration curve for @xmath6 determination .",
    "our values ( red dot on ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) ) are close enough to the middle of range , and at the same time are in excellent agreement with results of pdk and some most recent works ( see soubiran et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the references ) .",
    "there is another work @xcite were mgh lines was used for @xmath6 determination and give @xmath15 for effective temperature of 4375 k. if we use our calibration curve for @xmath16 we will obtain very close value of @xmath6 , around 1.9 .",
    "our analysis was provided in the framework of classical approach .",
    "we did not account a few important processes witch might affect the intensities and profile shapes of spectral lines in stellar spectra , i.e. nlte , dependence of @xmath17 with depth , rotation , chromospheres ( see bell et al . 1985 ) for more details .",
    "nevertheless , we obtained several interesting results of the common interest :    * we selected 23 more less clean from the atomic lines mgh features in the wavelength range 5100 - 5200   .",
    "the information about them is available in the web : + ( www.mao.kiev.ua/staff/yp/results/mghclean.ascii ) .",
    "* we show that absorption spectrum of mgh molecule is suitable for finding fundamental parameters of cool stars such as arcturus .",
    "* there is a degeneration of @xmath11 on @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain the calibration curve which can be used for @xmath6 determination if @xmath5 and abundance of mg are fixed by any other independent method . *",
    "our values for @xmath5 and @xmath6 determined for arcturus are in good agreement with other works .",
