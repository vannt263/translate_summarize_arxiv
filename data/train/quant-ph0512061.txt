    "the availability of matter in a coherent state has renewed the interest in bragg scattering with massive particles .",
    "various types of gratings have been developped based on arrangements of two nearly degenerate laser beams @xcite or microfabricated structures @xcite .",
    "these techniques have drawbacks however : optical lattices are not flexible in the sense that it is difficult to implement local variations or disorder , their geometry is frozen by the incident radiation of a few laser beams , and their lattice constant is limited by the wavelength of the employed lasers . on the other hand , microstructured gratings are unalterable by their design , and they are generally two - dimensional .    in magnetic traps incident microwave or radio frequency radiation can have a strong impact on the trapping potential .",
    "this is due to the fact that the potential depends on the magnetic substate of the trapped atoms .",
    "the energy of this substate can be manipulated by admixing other substates via resonant radio frequency radiation . in inhomogeneous magnetic fields",
    "this coupling is local and leads , within a dressed states picture , to avoided level crossings @xcite .",
    "atoms moving across an area where the coupling is strong , follow adiabatic potentials by avoiding the crossings .",
    "this feature is e.g.  used for evaporative cooling , where trapped magnetic states are coupled to untrapped states at certain distances from the trap center @xcite and for certain schemes of output coupling atom laser beams from trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "atomic traps based on avoided crossings have been proposed by zobay _",
    "_ @xcite and pioneered by perrin _ et al .",
    ". meanwhile double - well potentials have been built using this approach @xcite , and resonators for atoms have been demonstrated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose to generate periodic potentials for atoms by combining appropriate magnetic field gradients with the application of multimode radio frequency radiation .",
    "as compared to optical or microfabricated gratings , gratings based on radio frequency combs possess a number of advantages .",
    "they work for atoms with low- _ and _ high - field seeking magnetic moments with a phase of the grating , which depends on the atomic internal state .",
    "furthermore , the technique allows for an almost complete control over the spatial shape and the temporal evolution of the potentials . in particular ,",
    "irregular patterns may be formed , and very small structures , only limited by the size of the technically feasible magnetic field gradient , may give rise to gratings with very small lattice constants . with properly shaped magnetic fields almost arbitrary @xmath2",
    "potential geometries are imaginable .",
    "it is even possible to design time - dependent shapes , e.g.  to shift , merge or split individual potential sites .",
    "the range of possible manipulations and applications seems inexhaustible .",

    "we estimate the smallest periodicity , which can be realized using radio frequency combs , discuss how to generate moving gratings in order to perform bragg scattering experiments and how to use the phenomenon of bloch oscillations to probe such a grating .",

    "[ secsquare ] , is a way of modifying the shape of a magnetic trap using microwave radiation . in ordinary magnetic traps , atomic spin states with identical zeeman shifts",
    "experience the same confining force regardless of the mass of the trapped particles .",
    "the possibility to design magnetic potentials with arbitrary shapes provides a useful handle to selectively manipulate mixtures of different species .",
    "we consider an atomic ground - state with hyperfine structure having the total spin @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic sublevels @xmath4 are split in an external magnetic field @xmath5 by an amount @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the atomic @xmath8-factor of the hyperfine level .",
    "an irradiated linearly polarized radio frequency @xmath9 couples the sublevels @xmath10 with @xmath11 , wherever it is close to resonance , provided the orientations of the radio frequency and the magnetic fields are orthogonal .",
    "the coupling strength is given by the rabi frequency @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the orientation of the local static magnetic field .",

    "however for sufficiently low rabi frequencies and large frequency separation of the components the dynamics is essentially governed by the component which is closest to resonance .",

    "a major concern is the dependence of the coupling strength on the relative orientation of the radio frequency polarization and the magnetic field .",
    "any variation of the field vector orientation over the region , where the atoms are trapped , introduces a position - dependence of the rabi frequency .",
    "this problem can be avoided by chosing a sufficiently large magnetic offset field , which defines a spatially invariant quantization axis , and by arranging for an orthogonal polarization vector . on the other hand , this feature may be technically exploited as an additional handle for shaping the adiabatic potentials @xcite .",

    "lattice structures on a length scale of a few @xmath1 nm , which are certainly feasible , could be of interest for the generation of disordered potentials with the aim of studying atomic bose and anderson glasses @xcite .",
    "the most interesting regime , where the length scale of the disorder is smaller than the healing length of a bose - einstein condensate , is difficult to reach with optical speckle patterns @xcite .",
    "in contrast the regime is quite accessible to radio frequency lattices .",

    "multifrequency signals can be generated by a variety of techniques .",
    "the most convenient is probably to use arbitrary waveform generators programmed with the fourier transform of the desired frequency spectrum . in order to generate moving radio frequency lattices , a whole period @xmath61 has to be programmed . in our example , for radio frequencies up to @xmath72khz",
    "the number of oscillations within @xmath61 is @xmath73 .",
    "if we count at least @xmath74 points to resolve an oscillation , we need to program waveforms with @xmath75 points , which is feasible with state - of - the - art arbitrary waveform generators .",
    "atoms are bragg - reflected at a lattice if their de broglie wavelength is commensurable with the lattice constant , i.e.  their velocity is given by eq .",

    "in contrast to the propagation velocity , which increases with the lattice constant , the resonant bragg velocity is inversely proportional to it .",

    "equating the two velocities , @xmath77 , we derive @xmath78 which gives @xmath79g / cm for the present conditions .",
    "thus for anisotropic traps , for which the secular frequencies differ for different axis , a pronounced directional selectivity of the atomic interaction with the moving lattice can be expected .",
    "the directions in which atoms are accelerated are only those , where the bragg condition is satisfied .",
    "[ figure5](c ) shows a time series of the adiabatic potentials produced by the frequency comb specified above . when the frequency components are ramped , the potential wells at both sides of the trap origin migrate in opposite directions",
    ". this feature can be useful for realizing atom interferometers .",
    "the technique is obviously not limited to uniform gratings propagating with constant speed . as an example that arbitrary time signals may be programmed fig .",
    "[ figure5](d ) shows the sequential fourier transform of a waveform consistent of three frequency components , which are differently modulated in amplitude and phase .    a powerful tool to probe and characterize atom optical gratings are _ bloch oscillations_. this phenomenon occurs when a constant force , @xmath80 , is applied to cold atoms interacting with the grating .",
    "the force can be gravity , or it can be generated by an accelerated motion of the grating @xcite . for bloch oscillations to occur in lowest band , an adiabaticity criterion similar to the landau - zener criterion ( [ eq12 ] ) follows from the bloch model : interband tunneling at the edge of a brillouin zone is prevented if the rate of change of potential energy due to acceleration is smaller than the size @xmath33 of the band gap , i.e.  @xmath81 .",
    "this leads immediately to @xmath82 inserting the recoil energy and the expressions  ( [ eq09 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , we obtain an inequality for @xmath53 and @xmath54 . this inequality is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] as the hatched zone below the dash - dotted curve for the case that the acceleration is due to gravity @xmath83 m/s .",
    "another application of adiabatic potentials is the realization of non - harmonic potentials via the irradiation of appropriate radio frequencies and microwaves .",

    "being of different species is particularly useful for studies of their interaction .",
    "an example where this plays a role is a mixture of the high - field seeking states @xmath23li @xmath84 and @xmath85rb @xmath86 @xcite . for this case",
    ", sympathetic cooling of li via rb to very low temperatures ( such as those needed for reaching the critical temperature for bcs - pairing ) requires a sensitive matching of the respective gas densities : this guarantees that the li fermi temperature is lower than the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation of rb @xcite and reduces fermion - hole heating as far as possible @xcite .",
    "this respective density - matching is now possible by controlling the potentials shape via microwave or radio frequencies .    for this example",
    ", the following scenario could be used to transfer atoms into a potential with a flat bottom in which an atomic cloud adopts a nearly homogeneous density distribution .",
    "one starts producing an atomic cloud , e.g.  of @xmath85rb atoms in the @xmath86 state . with a properly designed adiabatic sweep the majority of the atoms",
    "can be transferred to @xmath87 , and a microwave frequency resonant to the @xmath88 state at some distance from the trap center is irradiated [ cf .",

    "[ figure6](b ) ] .",
    "note that there is a second trapping potential for those @xmath86 atoms that were initially in the center .",
    "to conclude we believe that radio frequency combs in conjunction with magnetic field are a versatile tool for manipulating the atomic motion on small length scales .",
    "the gratings are very stable and flexible .",
    "in fact the lattice constant is only limited by the magnetic field gradient , which is technically feasible . in our examples",
    "gradients of @xmath89g / cm have been used , but gradients of several @xmath90g / cm can certainly be realized in environments , which are compatible with cold atom optics .",
    "potential applications of time- or position - dependent radio frequency combs may include bragg velocity filters , bragg interferometers , quasi - random potentials with disorder occurring on a very small length scale , and other atom optical elements .    in a variety of cases , such as in two - species experiments , it is important to control the atomic densities without modifying the magnetic field gradients .",
    "as an example , we have discussed the @xmath23li - @xmath85rb mixture , where the feature of deforming magnetic trapping potentials by radio frequency radiation in a controlled manner is crucial in order for sympathtic cooling to be efficient down to very low temperatuires .",
