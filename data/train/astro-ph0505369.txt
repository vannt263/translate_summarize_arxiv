    "_ the problem of dark matter surrounding spiral galaxies _ , wrote van albada et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , _ is one of the most enigmatic questions in present day astrophysics .",
    "a number of years of intensive research have brought little or no clarification . _    earlier suggestions to resolve mass discrepancy were on the conservative side .",
    "bahcall and cassertano ( 1985 ) spoke of _ missing mass _ as synonymous to _ missing light_. tremaine and lee ( 1987)with _ dark matter _ meant the matter whose existence was inferred only through its gravitational effects .",
    "critics were vocal .",
    "outstanding among them milgrom ( 1983 a , b , c ) , the architect of _ mond _ , spoke of the _ dark side of the dark matter hypothesis _ and _ of its arbitrariness in that one invokes the dark matter in the correct amount and spatial distribution needed to explain the mass discrepancy in each and every case for itself _ ( 1987 ) .",
    "in the course of the past two decades acurate observations of velocity curves of spiral galaxies have become available.see , e. g. , begeman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , sanders ( 1996 ) , sanders and verheijen ( 1998 ) , mc gauph and de blok ( 1998 ) .",
    "credible velocity dispersions of galactic systems have emerged .",
    "see , for example , tullly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for data on ursa majoris cluster . on the theoretical side",
    "many ingenious and bold candidates for dark matter have been offered .",
    "a list compiled by ostriker and steinhardt ( 2003 ) includes items such as cold collisionless dark matter , strongly self interacting dark matter , warm dark matter , repulsive dark matter , fuzzy dark matter , self annihilating dark matter , decaying dark matter , etc .    in spite of all these developments",
    ", however , there is no clue as how to detect the dark matter and get to the physics that it obeys .",
    "the issue does not seem less enigmatic than what von albada and his colleagues described in 1985 .",
    "arguments pro and con are the same as a quarter of century ago .",
    "proponents of dark matter assume the validity of newtonian dynamics at all distance scales and look for one or another form of hypothetical matter to provide the missing gravity .",
    "skeptics , on the other hand , see no logic in resorting to a concept that solves the riddle of dynamics but remains unamenable to further validation by any other known physical means",
    ".    a historical reminder might be timely . in the closing decade of the 19th .",
    "century , physicists had agreed that light was an electromagnetic wave . and out of the experience with waves in other contexts",
    "had required a medium of propagation for it , the ether . yet",
    "ether evaded all attempt of detection no matter how ingeniously the detection devices were designed . on the other hand the notion of medium of propagation seemed so obvious to everyone , that some of the brightest minds of the time invoked theories that would have kept the ether , but in a concealed form .",
    "the famous transformations of lorentz were developed primarily to explain the null results of the experiments of fiseau , michelson , michelson & morely , etc .",
    ", rather than as a foundation for the special relativity that emerged later .",
    "it was up to einstein to think and later to speak out that _ our concepts have no legitimacy beyond what the complex of our experiences bestows upon them_. if experiments do not reveal the ether it could be dispensed with . if experiments show that the speed of light is the same in all reference frames , that could be a fact to build the new physics upon it .    in these early years of the 21st .",
    "century , it would not be unwise to take einstein s advice seriously . accept the validity of newtonian dynamics in solar and similar systems , where it has been tested , but look for alternatives in larger galactic and extragalactic scales , where it has not been verified .",
    "many researchers have actually adopted such a point of view before .",
    "see sanders and mc gauph ( 2002 ) for a review of milgrom s _ mond _ and earlier attempts . here , we adopt a variational approach to the problem .",
    "we amend the classical action by adding a term to it that eventually makes provision for the field energy to serve partially as its own source .",
    "the procedure is apt to a general relativistic generalization , in preparation for a future presentation .",
    "the system to be considered is a collection of point masses @xmath0 at positions @xmath1 , @xmath2 ; plus the field @xmath3 at point @xmath4 . both newtonian equation of motion and equation of gravitational field",

    "the formal statement of the assumption is the following : the classical action integral from which newton s laws are inferred is inadequate in galactic and extragalactic scales .",

    "( 10 - 15 ) .",
    "we recall that the main issues in the analysis of the velocity curves of spirals are : a ) insufficiency of the observed and/or estimated stellar masses to provide the required dynamical effect , and b ) the flatness of the velocity curves beyond what the distribution of observed masses would permit .",
    "similarly , in clusters of galaxies , again the observed masses are much smaller than the virial ones , inferred from the velocity dispersion in the cluster .",
    "the increased effective mass discussed above could provide a partial answer in both cases of luminous mass deficiency .",
    "the flatness of the rotation curves is a matter of the distribution of effective masses .",
    "for example , if there are enough low luminosity collapsed faint objects in the outskirts of spiral arms the velocity curves could be flattened enough .",
    "the field in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , unlike the newtonian one , is not proportional to the mass of the constituent members and does not admit of superposition principle . even in the case of approximate superposition in systems with widely separated components , the field of each component",
    "is a highly nonlinear function of its mass .",
    "this nonlinearity could prove useful in discussions of tully - fisher relation in spirals , an empirical relation between the brightness of the galaxy and the asymptotic orbital speed at the flat end of the velocity curve .",
    "the tully - fisher relation , with the assumption of a further empirical mass to light ratio for the galaxy , translates into a power law between the asymptotic speed and the total mass , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in the present dynamics , @xmath51 will sensitivity depend on the compaction factor , the fraction , and the distribution of the compact members of the galaxy .",
    "same considerations and reservations holds for the faber - jackson relation , another empirical relation between the velocity dispersion in cluster of galaxies and the luminosity of the cluster .    in section 3.3 ,",
    "conservation laws were derived for the case of approximate superposition .",
    "one can , however , do better .",
    "the total lagrangian , @xmath52 , is invariant under time translations , coordinate translations , and coordinate rotations .",
    "therefore , seven first integrals of motion , corresponding to energy , momenta , and angular momenta , should exist .",
    "this point of view will be presented elsewhere .",
    "birkhof s theorem states that in newtonian and relativistic regimes the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric system is independent from the internal structure of the system .",
    "this is not the case in the present theory as it is highlighted by the presence of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "this may open the possibility of studying the history of contraction or collapse of an object by logging the external gravitational field of the object as it evolves .    from eq.(7 ) , the effective force on a test particle is derived from a potential .",
    "it could be eliminated in a freely falling frame of reference , meaning that the dynamics developed here admits of equivalence principle .",
    "this is hardly surprising . for , in the action integrals of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) one single mass @xmath0 is used to compose the kinetic and the gravitational potential energies of the system .",

    "b ) the effective mass attains its full significance when the source object shrinks into sizes of the order of schwarzschild radius .",
    "logically , a covariant general relativistic approach should be adopted .",
    "presently , we are looking for a field equation and a geodesic one in which some sort of mutual interactions between distant points , similar to one in @xmath53 are taken into account . as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , there will be a free parameter @xmath7 in the formulation .",

    ". this will be presented elsewhere .",
