    "quantum information processing has been characterized by a rapid pace of theoretical progress and slower development of experimental techniques . at the current time",
    ", the differential is clearly visible : while most experimental realizations to date are limited to a handful of qubits or less , much theoretical effort is devoted to elucidating the potential of quantum computers with thousands or even millions of qubits . as experiments progress",
    "there is a need to evaluate the many suggested experimental implementations , to determine if they are feasible as proposed .",
    "the evaluations need not be elaborate , just the calculation of some figures of merit that indicate the technology s computational merit . as an example of such a calculation , we present here simulation results and fidelities for the cnot gate and for the three qubit deutsch - josza algorithm implemented in a model system of a spin - coupled quantum dot array with exchange - only quantum computation.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1    the possibility of employing coupled quantum wells for quantum information processing was first proposed by landauer , and barenco _ et al . _ in the mid-1990s.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 numerous researchers have since elaborated upon these ideas .",
    "we investigate here the quantum dot implementation proposed by loss and divincenzo.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 as suggested by these authors , we consider a linear quantum dot array where each dot arises as a localized region within a two dimensional electron gas , with the localization imposed by electrical gating .",
    "each qubit is realized as the spin of an unpaired electron on the quantum dot .",
    "following ref .  , we shall assume the spin - orbit interaction is negligible , and the effect of surrounding nuclear spins will be incorporated into the error terms .",
    "thus , the spin of each electron constitutes a well - defined two dimensional hilbert space . employing spin rather than orbital degrees of freedom",
    "greatly reduces the effects of decoherence , since the spin states couple much less strongly to the environment than the charge states.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 whereas the charge degrees of freedom are characterized by a decoherence rate on the order of nanoseconds@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 , the spin degrees are relatively resistant to errors , and dephasing rates in the microsecond range can be expected.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 it should be noted that these figures stem from experiments done under non - decoherence suppressing conditions , and one might expect that with more elaborate experimental set - ups , _ e.g. _ taking advantage of spin polarization and spin echo techniques , the effects of inhomogeneous broadening as well as the hyperfine coupling between the electron and surrounding nuclear spins can be reduced . to date , there has been no actual experimental realization of the spin - coupled quantum dot array .",
    "however , demonstrated experimental ability to control the coupling between the dots@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 and observations of coherent and long - lived spin oscillations@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 indicates that a quantum computer as envisioned by loss and divincenzo could be realizable .    assuming that tunable gates , well - defined arrays , and reasonable control of decoherence processes have been achieved , the issue of measurement remains .",
    "less work has been done on the realization of quantum measurement in these systems , although efforts towards experimental realization of single spin measurements in the solid state have been made.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 since at the outset of these simulations no experimentally demonstrated measurement scheme existed , we have made the simplest assumption of noiseless projective measurements .    in this work",
    "we employ the isotropic exchange interaction for coupling quantum spins with the exchange - only quantum computation scheme of refs .  , , and .",
    "use of an isotropic exchange interaction amounts to an idealization of the system as it generally exists in an experimental setting . for real quantum dots ,",
    "some exchange anisotropy may arise from the effects of the finite spin - orbit coupling.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 this anisotropy may be dealt with by modified encoding@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 or by pulse - shaping techniques.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 both of these approaches can in principle be applied to the simulation analysis presented here .",
    "a criteria for any quantum processing device is that two qubits can be coupled in a non - trivial way . in the quantum dot arrays under consideration here ,",
    "this coupling arises from the nearest neighbour spin - spin interactions described by the heisenberg exchange hamiltonian:@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the spin operators at site @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the pauli matrices , and @xmath6 is the exchange coupling strength .",
    "loss and divincenzo have shown that when the exchange interaction is pulsable ( i.e. , it can be switched between finite `` on '' and low or zero `` off '' values ) this exchange interaction allows the implementation of @xmath7 , which , in conjunction with local unitaries , is equivalent to xor ( also known as cnot).@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 the switching is controlled by the integrated coupling strength @xmath8 over the pulse duration @xmath9 , with the @xmath10 gate being achieved for @xmath11 and @xmath7 for one half of this . to facilitate calculations with this spin hamiltonian",
    "it is convenient to rescale it by addition of a unit operator , to arrive at the exchange operator @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the 4-by-4 identity matrix for the two - qubit hilbert space . this rescaled operator acts to exchange the states of physical qubits @xmath4 and @xmath15 . in the rest of this paper all exchange gate times pertaining to single or two qubit gates will be given based on this exchange operator , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "as such they will be expressed in units of @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , in the solid state one - qubit gates are often technically more demanding than two - qubit gates.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 thus even the simple one - qubit gates required to obtain the xor from @xmath7 require a high degree of experimental and technical sophistication .",
    "_ showed that the heisenberg interaction can be made universal by itself , with the use of a suitable encoding ( `` encoded universality'').@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 for a linear quantum dot array as that considered here , one possible encoding is to represent each logical qubit using three physical qubits : @xmath17 note that total spin along the z - axis , @xmath18 , is conserved and equal to @xmath19 , and that the states , in addition , are eigenstates of @xmath20 .",
    "the computational basis is @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . with this encoding ,",
    "an @xmath23 operation that is locally equivalent to cnot between logical qubits , has been shown to be feasible with 19 exchanges@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 between adjacent pairs of physical qubits .",
    "this operation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .     switched on for time @xmath9 . as a result of the symmetry of the gate sequence",
    ", only 7 independent variables are required to define the gate times of the entire 19-gate sequence.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1,width=384,height=192 ]    it should be noted that 19 is an upper limit on the number of serial exchanges required , obtained through numerical optimization of the makhlin invariants@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 , and it is possible that a smaller number might suffice .",
    "the number of exchange operations can also be reduced if one considers a more complex quantum dot architecture that supports non - nearest neighbour interactions , rather than the linear array studied here . in particular ,",
    "if in addition to exchanges @xmath24 , any @xmath25 connection is accessible , then full parallelism is possible . with parallel exchanges of this type a one - qubit rotation can be shown to require only 3 exchanges , and a cnot gate only 8 exchanges.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1    universal quantum information processing will require that we can implement the cnot gate between any two logical qubits , and not just between adjacent qubits .",
    "this need is apparent even for such simple algorithms as the three qubit deutsch - josza algorithm that tests whether an arbitrary function is balanced or constant.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 we shall see below that one of the black box gate sequences describing a balanced function for the three qubit deutsch - josza algorithm requires a cnot gate between qubits 1 and 3 .",
    "we shall refer to this as cnot(1,3 ) .",
    "analysis of truth tables for combinations of cnots between neighbouring dots readily shows that a cnot(1,3 ) gate is equivalent to a pairwise sequence of four cnot gates between adjacent dots , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]        it would be perfectly valid to employ this pairwise adjacent sequence to represent cnot(1,3 ) .",
    "however , since each cnot requires 19 exchange operations , this would entail implementing a total of @xmath26 exchange gates . here ,",
    "recognition of the relation between exchange and swap operations allows for a more efficient solution .",
    "we note that any exchange gate when applied for a duration equivalent to a @xmath27 pulse , yields the swap operation , and that exchange gates may be inter converted by action of the appropriate swap operations , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath28 combining an exchange gate between logical qubits @xmath4 and @xmath29 with exchange - generated swap operations immediately before and after , thereby makes the exchange operational between any two qubits @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is summarized by the following : @xmath30 making use of this relation , we find that a cnot gate between qubits 1 and 3 can now be performed with only 55 exchanges , an overall saving of 21 operations compared with the pairwise adjacent scenario depicted in fig  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the makhlin invariants@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 guarantee a sequence of exchange gates and times that provide a two - qubit unitary @xmath31 which is locally equivalent to the cnot .",
    "this is not necessarily equal to cnot in the computational basis . to use our exchange - only cnot in conjunction with other gates ,",
    "we therefore need to find a set of local unitaries that transform this locally equivalent gate to the cnot in the computational basis .",
    "mathematically , we can represent the transformation as : @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 designate local basis transformations each consisting of at most 4 exchange gates@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 that act on the first or the second logical qubit .",
    "for @xmath31 we employ here the optimized sequence of 19 exchange gates from ref .  .",
    "it is then possible , using a procedure introduced by makhlin@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 , to find the local unitaries ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) by i ) recasting @xmath31 in the bell basis , @xmath37 , ii ) evaluating the spectrum of @xmath38 , and iii ) then relating this matrix of eigenvalues to the corresponding matrix for the cnot gate in the computational basis . here @xmath39 is the matrix that transforms @xmath31 from the computational basis to the bell basis , and @xmath40 is the matrix transpose of @xmath41 . having obtained the local unitaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , it remains to decompose these into an actual sequence of exchange gates in order to perform full exchange - only computation .",
    "we describe here two ways to accomplish this decomposition .",
    "the first is a general procedure based on numerical optimization .",
    "the second is an analytic procedure that is specific to the present case , since it relies on the ability to find analytic solutions to systems of trigonometric equations that may be less tractable for other situations .    for both approaches we give the times @xmath9 for the individual exchange gates in units of @xmath45 .",
    "we cite all time values as positive numbers here , and implicitly assume that the pulse - integrated exchange coupling value @xmath46 is constant .",
    "( in ref .",
    ", burkard _ et al . _",
    "consider the possibility of tuning the heisenberg interaction around the point of zero coupling , thus allowing @xmath46 to assume both positive and negative values . )",
    "note that all gate times are defined modulo @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ an exchange gate implemented for @xmath9 is identical ( up to a global phase of -1 ) to one implemented for @xmath47 ( see discussion above and refs . and ) .    for the numerical optimization procedure",
    ", we first express the local basis transformations , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , as sequences of 4 exchange gates .",
    "we then use a version of the nelder - mead simplex algorithm@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 to find those sequences that minimize both the matrix distance from the resulting cnot gate eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnot_exchange ] ) to the true cnot in the computational basis , and the extent of leakage out of the encoded subspace .",
    "the nelder - mead algorithm is an example of a direct search method , _",
    "i.e. _ it uses only function evaluations and does not rely upon any derivative information about the cost function .",
    "each iteration begins with a geometric figure , a _ simplex _ , created from @xmath48 coordinates in parameter space , where @xmath49 is the number of variables of the cost function to be optimized .",
    "from this first simplex , new points are generated and the cost function is evaluated at these new coordinates . a new simplex , possessing better descent characteristics than the previous , is then generated from the cost function evaluations and the new test points.@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 the nelder - mead method is known to work well in low - dimensional instances such as those studied here .",
    "the local character of the method is nevertheless a concern . to avoid getting trapped in local minima",
    ", the parameter space must be densely sampled .",
    "we accomplish this here by _ shooting _ initial coordinates into parameter space , followed by optimization from the coordinate that gave the smallest initial value of the cost function .    as noted above",
    ", our cost function contains two components .",
    "first , it includes an element by element matrix equivalence criteria , _",

    "second , it contains a component that provides a penalty for leakage out of the encoded subspace , namely the sum of the absolute value of all matrix elements connecting states in the encoded logical subspace to states outside this subspace , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .    , can be represented by the above matrix decomposition .",
    "the logical hilbert space has dimension @xmath50 for n logical qubits .",
    "the complete hilbert space has dimension @xmath51 , corresponding to n physical qubits.,width=336,height=240 ]    these two requirements of minimal matrix distance from the target cnot and non - leakage from the encoded subspace lead to the following expression for the cost function : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of logical qubits and @xmath54 the number of physical qubits .",
    "the first summation represents the matrix distance between eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnot_exchange ] ) and the target cnot , and the second summation , which goes over the lower left - hand block of the matrix in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] , represents the extent of leakage .",
    "the second summation thus consists of terms connecting basis states @xmath55 inside the encoded logical subspace to all basis states @xmath56 outside the encoded logical subspace .    since we employ the 19-exchange sequence for @xmath31 from ref .",
    ", the numerical optimization is restricted here to the two sets of 8-exchange sequences representing @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we implement this by constructing a sequence of 35 gates ( i.e. , 4 + 4 + 19 + 4 + 4 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) with gates 9 - 27 taken from ref .  , and then optimizing the cost function @xmath59 , eq .  ( [ eqn : costfunction ] ) , for the matrix resulting from the entire 35-exchange sequence only over the 16-dimensional parameter space of the two 8-exchange sequences .",
    "we note that since the available nearest neighbor exchanges @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond simply to rotations of the logical states around the z - axis and about an axis oriented along @xmath62 , respectively@xmath0@xcite@xmath1 , the exchange - based local gates will therefore not take states outside the logical subspace and will hence not add to the leakage term .",
    "the leakage parameter is therefore determined solely by the accuracy of the underlying gate sequence for @xmath31 .",
    "we have found that for such a 35-gate sequence , the overall cost function c can readily be reduced to less than @xmath63 by this numerical optimization .",
    "more specifically , we find that the matrix distance ( first term of eq .  [ eqn : costfunction ] ) between this 35 gate long sequence and the exact cnot is @xmath64 and that the leakage term ( second term of eq .  [ eqn : costfunction ] ) is @xmath65 ( equal to the value for @xmath31 , as noted above ) . this level of optimization corresponds to a maximum element matrix distance from cnot ( _ i.e. _ , maximum matrix element inaccuracy ) of @xmath66 .",

    "the corresponding 35 gate times given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] will generate the exact cnot to within a cost function value @xmath71 , corresponding to a maximum matrix element distance of @xmath72 . , width=288,height=192 ]    the second approach to finding an exchange - only representation of the local unitaries is analytic solution through matrix manipulations , as follows .",
    "we first analyze the similarity transformation @xmath73 that diagonalizes @xmath74 from ref .   in the computational basis ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a diagonal 4-by-4 matrix .",
    "we found that @xmath73 can be expressed as local operations on the logical qubits , namely @xmath77 .",
    "mapping the @xmath78 spin rotations to rotations in @xmath79 and using the quaternion representation for @xmath79 rotations ( see appendix  [ app : quaternions ] for details ) , we find that this similarity transformation can be realized using only 3 exchange gates . from the diagonal matrix @xmath76 ,",
    "one can then readily generate a c - phase gate in the computational basis by merely performing rotations around the z - axis .",
    "transformation of the resulting c - phase into the desired cnot is subsequently realized by acting with hadamard gates on the second logical qubit both before and after the resulting c - phase .",
    "these elementary gates are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . both the @xmath80 rotations and the hadamard gate have analytic exchange - only solutions on the encoded subspace ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : singlequbitgates ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "we thereby arrive at an alternative , fully analytic solution for an exchange - only realization of the local unitary transformations into the computational basis , requiring a total of 33 exchange gates .",
    "these may be reduced to a total of 30 exchanges by combining the times of any sequential exchanges on the same pairs of qubits that occur as a result of juxtaposition of elementary gates .",
    "consequently the desired overall transformation can now be completed with only 11 more exchanges than the underlying 19-exchange sequence for @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] , and then using the quaternion representation of the corresponding rotations in @xmath79 to find the sequences of exchange gates and the times , @xmath9 , that generate them ( appendix  [ app : quaternions ] ) .",

    "thus , our analytic solution has similar accuracy as the numerical solution above .",
    "however , the 30-exchange analytical sequence in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and table  [ tab : tab2 ] represents a saving in both total number of gates and total time , relative to the 35-exchange sequence of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the 30-exchange sequence requires total time @xmath85 , compared with @xmath86 for the 35-exchange sequence .",
