    "<S> the frustrated isotropic @xmath0 model with ferromagnetic @xmath1 and anti - ferromagnetic @xmath2 interactions in presence of an axial magnetic field shows many exotic phases , such as vector chiral and multipolar phases . </S>",

    "<S> etc_. in this paper , the phase boundaries of these exotic phases are calculated based on order parameters and jumps in the magnetization . in the strong magnetic field , @xmath3 symmetry is broken , therefore , order parameter of the vector chiral phase is calculated using the broken symmetry states . </S>",
