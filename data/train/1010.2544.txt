    "in a number of previous papers the possibility of forming a charged condensate in the core of white dwarfs , composed mainly of a single element ( helium or carbon ) , and its impact on the cooling process has been studied @xcite . it was observed that upon condensation the phonons which in standard scenarios of white dwarf evolution are the main carriers of internal energy , are eaten by the em gauge field , become massive and freeze out ( see also @xcite ) . in this circumstance",
    "the relatively small specific heat of the degenerate electrons ( @xmath3 ) remains as the only contributor to total heat capacity , hence the acceleration of the cooling process .",
    "in this paper we study the condensation of a white dwarf core containing both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this can in particular happen in the following situations :    1- carbon density @xmath6 is above @xmath7 , so that the critical temperature for condensation , @xmath8 , exceeds crystallization temperature @xmath9 , at about @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath6 should also remain below the neutronization threshold @xmath11 .",
    "in addition we allow the helium fraction , @xmath12 , to range from @xmath1 ( when the heat capacity of the impurity starts to dominate that of electron gas ) up to @xmath13 . in this range @xmath14 .",
    "2- when the white dwarf is composed mainly of @xmath4 at densities higher than or equal to @xmath15 , as in low mass helium white dwarfs ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "we also assume the existence of carbon impurities greater than @xmath17 . in this case @xmath18 , so one may expect that after the condensation of @xmath4 nuclei the @xmath5 nuclei form a crystal at @xmath9 . however due to screening effects of @xmath4-condensate ( studied in @xcite ) ,",
    "the @xmath5 nuclei barely interact with each other and fail to crystallize .",
    "therefore it is likely that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 nuclei in the core condense as the temperature drops below their @xmath19 .",
    "the condensate can well be described by an effective field theory similar to the one developed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , after the condensation of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , there are two elements involved and in  2 we will modify the effective theory to describe it .",
    "we will show that the two component charged condensate , unlike its one component counterpart , possesses a massless collective mode in the spectrum of fluctuations with @xmath20 .",
    "this mode contributes to specific heat and changes the thermal history significantly .    the thermal evolution of the white dwarf , analyzed in  3 , would be as follows . at first",
    "the system can be approximated by an ideal gas with @xmath21 , and the @xmath22 plot of luminosity function ( lf ) in terms of luminosity has a slope of @xmath23 . upon the condensation of the first component",
    "the corresponding phonons freeze out @xcite , thus there is a fall in lf curve whose depth depends on the fraction of the second element .",
    "the specific heat of the second element s nuclei before condensation is approximately temperature independent ( @xmath24 ) , resulting in a lf curve with the same @xmath23 slope . finally as @xmath19 of the second component",
    "is approached there is no sharp drop in specific heat because of the existence of the massless mode , rather @xmath25 starts to decrease as @xmath2 , consequently lf curve continuously changes its slope to @xmath26 .",
    "we use thomas fermi approximation to treat electrons as a background density @xmath27 , and associate to each type of ion a complex scalar field with the appropriate charge and mass . in the circumstance of a white dwarf the ions are non - relativistic , therefore the most general effective lagrangian can be written as @xcite [ eq : lagrangian ] = & -&14 f_^2 + p_1((^*d_0-(d_0)^ * ) - ) + & + & p_2((x^*d_0x-(d_0x)^*x ) - ) + a_j_e^ , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are polynomial functions .",
    "this system possesses a condensate solution in which the positive charge density of @xmath32 and @xmath33 particles is neutralized by the negative charge of electrons , @xmath34 . to describe the condensate we perform the change of variables : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and choose a gauge in which @xmath37 , to obtain [ eq : lagr_cond ] & = & -14 f_^2 + _ 1(ga_0m_^2 - 12(_j)^2 -12g^2 ^ 2a_j^2 ) + & + & _ 2(g(a_0-)m_x^2 -12(_j)^2 -12g^2 ^ 2(a_j-)^2 ) + a_j_e^ ,    setting all derivatives except @xmath38 equal to zero in the equations of motion , the background solution must satisfy [ eq : bg ] & a_=_=0 , & + & p_1(0)=p_2(0)=1 , & + & j^0_+j^0_x+j^0_e=0 , & + & j^0_gm_^2 , j^0_xgm_x^2 . &",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations around this background contains two transverse and one longitudinal modes of a massive gauge field , and a nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "the existence of the latter is easily understood from the symmetries of the problem .",
    "the original lagrangian possesses two global @xmath39 symmetries corresponding to separate phase rotations of the two complex scalar fields .",
    "they , however , are spontaneously broken by the background solution , giving rise to two massless nambu - goldstone bosons . out of these two",
    "one combination becomes the longitudinal mode of the massive gauge field , while the other one remains massless . in the limit",
    "@xmath40 the dispersion relations simplify to [ eq : spectrum1 ] _",
    "t^2&=&*k*^2+m_1 ^ 2+m_2 ^ 2 . + _ l^2&= & 14(+ ) + m_1 ^ 2+m_2 ^ 2 , + [ eq : massless ] _",
    "g^2 & = & 14(+ ) , where we have defined [ eq : mdef ] m_1g_c ,   m_2g_c .",
    "had we started from a relativistic lagrangian , these dispersion relations would have remained unchanged to leading order , except for a @xmath41 correction to longitudinal photon .",
    "in addition , two heavy modes corresponding to pair productions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 particles would have appeared in the spectrum .",
    "note that when the density of one species tends to zero , @xmath42 approaches the mass of that species .",
    "this confirms that the particles of this type are efficiently screened by the charged condensate of the dominant element , and the massless mode describes the low energy excitations of a non - interacting bose - einstein condensate , formed by these screened particles .",
    "since fusion has terminated inside the white dwarfs , they cool down by radiation according to @xcite [ eq : cooling ] c_v=-=-c ( x_hea_he+x_ca_c)m_ut_*^7/2 , where @xmath25 is the average specific heat per nucleus , @xmath43 the luminosity , @xmath44 the total number of nuclei , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the baryon number and fraction of ion @xmath33 , @xmath47 the atomic mass unit , and @xmath5 a function of atmospheric composition . in this circumstance",
    "the luminosity function @xcite , which is an observable measure of the cooling rate of stars , under the assumption of uniform star formation both in space and time takes the form ^-1l^-1l^. here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined as exponents describing the temperature dependence of specific heat and luminosity c_v t^k ,  lt^4/n .",
    "@xmath49 is @xmath50 , thus , @xmath25 which is the single most important variable in white dwarf evolution ( given the composition of the star ) , is read easily from the @xmath22 plot of @xmath51 in terms of @xmath43 ( lf curve ) .",
    "at high temperature it is a good approximation to treat the ions as a classical gas with @xmath21 .",
    "this gives the familiar mestel cooling curve with @xmath52 .",
    "as the temperature drops below the @xmath53 ( see footnote 1 ) the @xmath33 nuclei cease to contribute to specific heat because of the gap emerging in the phonon dispersion relation ( as explained in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless the specific heat of the other species ( @xmath54 ) which is still in the gas state ( @xmath55 ) amounts effectively to @xmath56 per ion",
    ". therefore the lf curve drops by @xmath57 units .",
    "the curve continues with the same slope @xmath52 afterwards .",
    "as @xmath58 is approached the model of two component charged condensate can be applied to the system . except for the massless mode in the spectrum of fluctuations ,",
    "all the other modes have gaps larger than the temperature and are not excited significantly .",
    "therefore the specific heat per ion can be written as [ eq : c_v ] c_v= , where @xmath59 is the total number density of ions ( including both @xmath4 and @xmath5 nuclei ) , and @xmath60 is of order of the inverse interparticle separation of the less abundant element , above which the effective field theory description breaks down .",
    "well below @xmath58 the upper limit of integral can be taken to infinity yielding [ eq : c_v_lowt ] c_v= ( ) ^3/2 = 5(5/2)x_y()^3/2 , and since @xmath61 , there is no dramatic change in specific heat right after second condensation .",
    "nevertheless it starts to decline as @xmath2 , therefore the lf curve after about [ eq : tx - ty ] ( ) = ( ) - ( ) + ( ) , ( see eq . ) from the first condensation changes slope to @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude by giving two concrete examples and a schematic diagram of luminosity fuction fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] ( note that the typical variations of specific heat at transition points may significantly change the behavior near those points ) .    as the first example consider a carbon dominated superdense white dwarf with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and an envelope composition of x0,y0.9,z_m0.1 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath67 fraction , @xmath4 fraction and metallicity , respectively .",
    "carbon nuclei first reach their condensation temperature at @xmath68 when lf curve drops for @xmath69 unit , and the second condensation takes place later at @xmath70 .",
    "next consider a helium dominated white dwarf with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and atmospheric composition of x0.99,y0,z_m210 ^ -4 . in this case",
    "@xmath4 condenses first at @xmath73 with again a unit drop in lf curve , and then @xmath5 nuclei condense when @xmath74 .",
