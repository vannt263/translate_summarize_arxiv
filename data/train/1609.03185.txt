    "advances in quantum information and computing has bought on a shift in the way we think about information processing . taking advantage of quantum phenomenon like superposition and entanglement",
    ", one can extend the limits of computation that the classical complexity theory predicts@xcite .",
    "solution to many problems , which the classical theory predicts can not be improved beyond a certain limit have shown to be significantly faster with the quantum approach .",
    "shor s factoring algorithm @xcite and grover s search algorithm @xcite are examples of this speed - up.@xcite    the first indication of the superiority of quantum computers in being able to solve certain tasks came from deutsch and jozsa @xcite .",
    "their paper contained strong hints pointing towards the exponential speed - up capabilities of a quantum system when compared to the classical one .",
    "soon after , bernstein and vazirani made this more concrete by stating a problem and demonstrating its quantum solution to be having query complexity significantly less than what was possible by any classical approach@xcite .",
    "the solution to their problem which had a query complexity of @xmath0 by the best possible classical algorithm was shown to have @xmath1 in the quantum realm(polynomial speed - up ) .",
    "even more impressive was a different version of the problem , called the recursive bernstein - vazirani problem which had an exponential complexity in the classical world and a logarithmic one in the quantum(super polynomial speed - up ) .",
    "in addition to figuring out quantum algorithms to do various tasks , over the years , people have also worked out how to work with a general ` qudit ' system instead of the usual 2 level qubit @xcite .",
    "this means more information can be stored using fixed number of qudits .",
    "physically this can be implemented , for example , with three energy levels of a hydrogen atom for a qutrit system .",
    "the question of how to generalize known quantum algorithms for a qudit system is hence , of theoretical and practical importance@xcite . here",
    "the bernstein - vazirani problem is considered and its generalization to a higher dimensional system is derived and discussed .",
    "in the bernstein - vazirani problem we are given an oracle of the form , @xmath2 this takes as input an n - bit string and outputs a single bit .",
    "the function is defined to be , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is an unknown string and @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 bits of @xmath4 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the bernstein - vazirani problem is to find the unknown string @xmath4 by querying the oracle .      to find the hidden string ,",
    "all we are allowed to do is to query the function with different inputs . to find the first bit of the string",
    ", we can use the state ` 100 .. 0 ' as our query .",
    "if the first bit is 1 , the function will output 1 and if 0 , it will output 0 . similarly , to find",
    "the second bit we use the state ` 010 ... 0 ' as our query . proceeding this way",
    ", we can find all bits of the unknown string s. this means if the string has a length n , using this algorithm , we would require n queries to find it . that is , this algorithm has a classical query complexity of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to this , we also notice that since each bit in the string is completely independent of all the other bits , there is no other algorithm that provide a query complexity better than this .",
    "even though classical complexity theory limits the query complexity by @xmath0 the bernstein - vazirani s solution to the same problem is shown to have quantum query complexity of @xmath1 .",
    "this is unexpected and bizarre power of quantum information processing .",
    "described below is this algorithm .",
    "perhaps the most crucial step used in any quantum algorithm is fourier sampling .",
    "it involves applying the hadamard gate to each qubit of an n - qubit system .",
    "fourier sampling on a general computational basis state of an n - qubit system is given by the following transformation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates the operator obtained by tensoring @xmath12 n times .",
    "now , we use the interesting property of quantum gates that they are reversible and the hadamard turns out to be its own inverse .",
    "thus , @xmath13    in the bernstein - vazirani problem as described in above section , the aim is to find the unknown string @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that the fourier sampling on the superposition @xmath14 will give @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the problem drops down to setting up the above superposition using the quantum oracle and fourier sampling it to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "consider applying fourier transformation on an n - bit string @xmath15 .",
    "its output will be an equal superposition of all possible n - bit strings , all having positive phase @xcite .",
    "@xmath16        fig .",
    "1 . quantum circuit for berstein vazi-    rani algorithm for a two - level system .    this is the input we feed into the oracle @xmath17 as our query .",
    "we then take the output from @xmath17 and use it as the control bit in a cnot operation whose target bit is @xmath18 .",
    "if the control bit is one , that is , if the output of @xmath17 is one , the cnot will act on @xmath19 and change it to @xmath20 and if it is zero , then the target bit will stay as it is .",
    "now , in a tensor product of two quantum states we are free to associate the sign with whichever state we choose to .",
    "@xmath21 this means we can associate the negative sign of @xmath19 with @xmath22 in the superposition .",
    "this amounts to flipping the phase of the terms of the superposition whenever @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , we create the superposition @xmath24    in summary these are the transformations to setup the required superposition    @xmath25{{\\cal h } } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_x \\ket{x } \\xrightarrow[]{\\mathrm{use } f_s(x ) } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_x ( -1)^{s \\cdot x } \\ket{x}\\ ] ]    as explained earlier , taking the fourier transform of the last state would give the state @xmath26 , which we can then measure",
    ".      the generalized form of the quantum circuit will be one in which all the quantum states and gates will be replaced by their corresponding higher dimensional versions .",
    "the d - dimensional quantum state , instead of being a superposition of the kets @xmath27 and @xmath28 , will be one that of the kets @xmath29 .",
    "its phase is going to be of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 root of unity instead of the usual @xmath33 . during measurement",
    ", the generalized state behaves the same way as the normal state does .",
    "it collapses into any of its basis states with a probability given by the absolute square of its coefficient .",
    "the quantum states being able to take up more than two levels means more information condensed into a single state .",
    "next logical step in our process is to design higher dimensional quantum gates capable of manipulating these sates . out of many generalizations",
    "possible , here we look at what is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward@xcite .",
    "the motivation behind defining gates this way is that they allow for the creation of a higher dimensional analogue of the quantum circuit without much modification to the original one .    under this",
    ", the hadamard gate @xmath12 becomes the d - dimensional discrete fourier transform matrix defined by , @xmath34    cnot becomes the sum gate .",
    "@xmath35      in this section ,",
    "we provide an algorithm to solve the bernstein - vazirani problem for a d - dimensional system . here",
    "the problem changes to finding an unknown string @xmath36 by querying a function , @xmath37 given as a quantum oracle . in order to achieve this we set up the superposition @xmath38 @xmath39    using the given oracle .",
    "we then apply the tensor product of the d - dimensional fourier transform into this state to obtain back @xmath4 .    below",
    "we prove that fourier sampling on the superposition will give back @xmath4 and we explain how to set up the superposition .",
    "[ lemma1 ] primitive @xmath40 root of unity satisfy @xmath41 where @xmath42    consider the summation for a fixed @xmath43,@xmath44    for @xmath45 , it is easy to see that this is equal to @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 , @xmath48    or in other words , @xmath49      [ theorem ] the following quantum states defined by,@xmath50 _ where _ @xmath51__are orthogonal to each other for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "_ _    consider,@xmath50 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    as @xmath57 , we have ,    case 1 : @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    case 2 : @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    now consider the sum for a fixed @xmath43 , @xmath64 @xmath65    here @xmath66    using eq .",
    "( 4 ) in eq .",
    "( 8) we get , @xmath67    plugging this into ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively we have , @xmath70 @xmath71    which implies , @xmath72    or in other words , the states are orthogonal .",
    "now , the tensor product of the d - dimensional discrete fourier transform matrix is given by , @xmath73    this can be expressed as @xmath74 now we apply @xmath75 to @xmath76 ,    @xmath77which is the same as @xmath78 hence we show that the fourier sampling on the state @xmath76 gives @xmath26 .",
    "so if we manage to set up the superposition @xmath79 using the given oracle , we can then fourier sample it to get the required hidden string @xmath4 .",
    "the first step in setting up the superposition is fourier sampling the state @xmath15 , which gives @xmath80        fig .",
    "2 . quantum circuit for berstein vazi-    rani algorithm for a d - level system .",
    "we now take the oracle @xmath17 and feed this superposition as its query . the output from @xmath17",

    "is of the form @xmath83 .",

    "also , as @xmath89 and @xmath90 are bounded above by @xmath91 , @xmath43 is strictly less than @xmath92 . hence , when @xmath93 we have @xmath94 .",
    "now , if we take @xmath95 then , @xmath96 and we get back equation ( 10 ) .    hence applying the sum gate on @xmath82 will give , @xmath97    just as we did in the case for a 2-level system , we can associate this phase with any part of the tensor product .",
    "@xmath98 hence @xmath99 will become , @xmath100    as explained in the previous section , fourier sampling this state will give @xmath26 .",
    "a general bernstein - vazirani parity problem was defined and the corresponding quantum algorithm was generalized .",
    "this was done by replacing the quantum gates for qubits with the generalized quantum gates .",
    "it was seen that the superpositions @xmath76 and @xmath101 are orthogonal and this property was used to retrieve the unknown string s by fourier sampling them .",
    "the quantum query complexity of the original 2-dimensional problem is @xmath1 .",
    "since , even in the generalized version as only one input is to be given , the query complexity remains the same as in the 2-dimensional case .",
    "algorithms such as this clearly depict the power of quantum computing .",
    "even though quantum computing has been centered around two - level systems and most of the algorithms have been for qubits , higher dimensional systems might play a major role in the same . studying the generalizations of already existing quantum algorithms and developing new ones for the higher level systems will help us realize the potential of qudit systems .",
    "future work in this direction could be for example , a generalization of the recursive bernstein - vazirani algorithm for qudit systems ."
