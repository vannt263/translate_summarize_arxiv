    "probably the entanglement phenomenon , often named quantum non - locality @xcite , contains one of the most interesting features of quantum mechanics . actually , it is at the heart of current development of quantum information processing such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and telecloning @xcite .",
    "entanglement also plays a key role in secure communication , for instance the ekert protocol @xcite based on entangled states is more robust than bb84 one @xcite .",
    "it known that in quantum computation , the qubits are massively entangled .",
    "the preparation and characterization of entangled optical as well as atomic states has been studied extensively . in this respect and in a recent experimental advance ,",
    "the polarization - entangled photons were generated using type i or type ii parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "the production of entangled states belonging to an infinite dimensional hilbert space can be achieved also by adopting the standard technique of parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "the beam splitter is also one of the few experimentally accessible devices , which may be used to generate entangled states . in this sense",
    ", different developments have been reported on the analysis of beam splitter as entangler @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effect of beam splitting on the spin ( or su(2 ) ) coherent states for a single mode field was investigated in @xcite . in the same spirit",
    "the entanglement via a beam splitter of @xmath4 coherent states ( barut - giradello @xcite and perelomov ones @xcite ) was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the investigation of entanglement properties of coherent states @xcite is mainly motivated by the fact that the entangled nonorthogonal states also play an important role in the quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the quantum optical systems are extensively investigated in order to generate , characterize and understand the entanglement properties .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the analysis of the entangled phase states of single modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is well - known that the usual way to quantize these single modes is through the harmonic oscillator techniques with an infinity of states . in 1989 , pegg and barnett  @xcite suggested to truncate up to some finite , but arbitrarily large , order the infinite dimensional representation space of the harmonic oscillator algebra .",
    "this was done to get rid of the difficulty related to the infinite dimensional character of the representation space , which constitutes a drawback in defining a phase operator in a consistent way @xcite . here we introduce a generalized version of the weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebra that allows us to achieve our goal .",
    "we particularly consider one algebra possessing finite dimensional bosonic representations .",
    "this is essential in defining the hermitian phase operator and corresponding temporally stable phase states . for this purpose",
    ", we use a technique based on an approach developed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the phase parameter ensuring the temporal stability of phase states plays a crucial role in the present analysis",
    ". finally , we deal with the entanglement of phase states when passed trough a beam splitter .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a generalized weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebra , which extends the dynamical symmetry of the usual harmonic oscillator .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the corresponding finite dimensional hilbertian representation and derive the temporally stable phase states , which are obtained to be dependent of @xmath5 called phase parameter .",
    "this latter allows us to take into account the nature of the spectrum of the system .",
    "because of the absence of @xmath5 , one can immediately notice that the @xmath6 phase states derived in @xcite are identical to those obtained by pegg and barnett  @xcite for truncated harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the basic features of the phase states . in section 3 , we examine the entanglement resulting from the action of a beam splitter on the phase states . to investigate the degree of bipartite entanglement of the phase states , we determine the linear entropy .",
    "finally , we close by some concluding remarks .",
    "a basic ingredient that will be used in the forthcoming analysis is the generalized weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebra .",
    "this is generated algebraically by three elements denoted by @xmath7 , which are satisfying the commutation relations @xmath8",
    "= -~a^-,\\qquad \\left[n , a^+ \\right ] = + ~a^+,\\qquad   \\left[a^- , a^+\\right ] =   g(n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9^{\\dagger}$ ] is a hermitian function of the number operator @xmath10 .",
    "clearly , by requiring that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unity operator , we end up with the usual harmonic oscillator algebra .",
    "also , for @xmath13 , with two real parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , ( [ wha ] ) reproduces the @xmath16 algebra discussed in the context of fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to stress that this algebra covers the extended harmonic oscillator worked out in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the abstract fock representation of the above algebra through a complete set of orthonormal states @xmath17 those are eigenstates of the number operator @xmath10 , @xmath18 .",
    "in this representation , the vacuum state defined as @xmath19 and the ortho - normalized eigenstates constructed by successive applications of the creation operator @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , we define the actions of creation and annihilation operators as @xmath21\\varphi } } \\vert n - 1 \\rangle\\nonumber\\\\   a^+\\vert n \\rangle & = & \\sqrt{f(n+1 ) } e^{{-i [ f(n+1)- f(n)]\\varphi } } \\vert n+1   \\rangle \\label{action sur les n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the structure function @xmath22 is an analytic function , with the properties @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . the phase parameter @xmath5 will be discussed in the next by emphasizing its play a crucial role in constructing the phase states . in what follows",
    "we shall denote the fock space as @xmath26 where the operators @xmath20 and @xmath27 are mutually adjoint , @xmath28 on @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath22 satisfies the recursion relation @xmath29 which gives by simple iteration the form @xmath30    in the forthcoming analysis , we restrict ourselves to generalized oscillator algebra defined through the structure functions those fulfilling the condition @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a positive integer value .",
    "it this case , it follows that the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the nilpotency relations @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the corresponding representation is @xmath34-dimensional .",
    "it is interesting to note that by using ( [ sum ] ) , one can write the condition ( [ condition ] ) as @xmath35 where the trace is over the @xmath34-dimensional fock space . this new algebra is covering the following results :    * ( i)- the truncated harmonic oscillator introduced by pegg - barnett @xcite : @xmath36 * ( ii)- the finite dimensional oscillator algebra @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) defined in @xcite : @xmath39 , \\qquad g(n ) = { \\bf i } + 2\\kappa n. \\ ] ] * ( iii)- the truncated generalized oscillator algebra @xmath37 ( @xmath40 ) @xcite : @xmath41 , \\qquad   g(n ) = { \\bf i } + 2\\kappa n - f(2s+1)\\vert 2s \\rangle \\langle 2s \\vert.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath42 , corresponding to the special cases ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are respectively given by @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . at this level",
    ", we have different comments in order .",
    "it is easily seen that for @xmath47 , the case ( iii ) reduces to ( i ) . as mentioned before",
    ", the algebra ( [ wha ] ) is more general and covers many other variants of generalized harmonic oscillators . the particular cases ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are interesting in the context of quantum optics .",
    "indeed , the case ( i ) was introduced by pegg and barnett @xcite to define , in a consistent way , the phase operator .",
    "the others cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) constitute an extension of the ideas developed in  @xcite to define phase operator for systems with nonlinear spectrum @xcite .    using the algebraic structure of the generalized oscillator algebra ( [ wha ] )",
    ", one can introduce an operator that generalizes the hamiltonian @xmath48 for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "starting from @xmath49 it is easy to realize the required hamiltonian as @xmath50 where @xmath51 can be regarded as the hamiltonian corresponding to the algebra ( [ wha ] ) . as usual",
    ", one can proceed with the eigenvalue equation @xmath52 to get the solutions of the energy spectrum of a quantum dynamical system described by @xmath53 . as illustration of the realized hamiltonian ,",
    "we give the explicit forms for different cases mentioned above .",
    "indeed , we have for case ( i ) @xmath54 and case ( ii ) @xmath55 as well as case ( iii ) @xmath56 \\vert n \\rangle \\langle n \\vert.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we show how to build the phase states , which are temporally stable under time evolution . for this , recall that our hilbert space @xmath57 has @xmath34-dimensions where the actions of the operators @xmath27 and @xmath20 on @xmath26 are given in ( [ action sur les n ] ) .",
    "these are supplemented by the condition @xmath58 which can easily be deduced from the calculation of expectation value @xmath59 .",
    "as @xmath53 is a positive definite operator on the finite dimensional fock space , let us consider the decomposition of the annihilation @xmath27 and creation @xmath20 operators given by @xcite @xmath60 and one can show that the operator @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 \\varphi } \\vert n-1 \\rangle , \\qquad n = 1 , 2 , \\cdots , 2s        \\label{action de e }        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid modulo @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 \\varphi } \\vert 2s \\rangle .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that for @xmath66 , one can obtain @xmath67 \\varphi } \\vert n+1 \\rangle        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 should be understood modulo @xmath63 .",
    "note that from above relations , one can easily check that @xmath61 is an unitary operator .",
    "therefore , it is clear now that ( [ decompo cas fini ] ) constitutes a polar decomposition of the operators @xmath27 and @xmath20 . to deduce the phase states associated with the finite dimensional algebra defined in the previous subsection , let us in the beginning look at the eigenstates of the operator @xmath61 .",
    "in doing so , we solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 . according to the method developed in @xcite , it is easy to see that the eigenvalues @xmath71 should satisfy the discretization condition @xmath72 and therefore the complex variable @xmath71 is a root of unity , such as @xmath73 where the @xmath74 parameter is defined as @xmath75 thus , these tell us that the normalized eigenstates @xmath76 of @xmath61 are of the form @xmath77 where the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath80 which reflects that @xmath61 is indeed a phase operator and therefore @xmath81 are the required phase states .",
    "note that , in the particular case @xmath82 , the states @xmath83 correspond to an ordinary discrete fourier transform of the basis @xmath84 of the @xmath34-dimensional space @xmath26 .",
    "we show that the phase states @xmath81 are temporally stable under `` time evolution '' , namely @xmath85 for any value of the real parameter @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 plays a key role to ensure the temporal stability of the states @xmath81 . for fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "they satisfy the equiprobability relation @xmath87 they constitute an orthonormal set @xmath88 for fixed @xmath5 and satisfy the closure property @xmath89 finally , it is interesting to note that the temporally stable phase states are not all orthogonal .",
    "indeed , the overlap between two phase states @xmath90 and @xmath81 reads as @xmath91 where the function @xmath92 is @xmath93 and @xmath74 is given in ( [ definition of q ] ) .    at this level",
    ", we would like to emphasize the key role of the phase parameter @xmath5 introduced starting from relations ( [ action sur les n ] ) that defines the actions of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "indeed , firstly @xmath5 ensures the temporal stability of the phase states @xmath81 ( [ coherentstatemvarphi ] ) under time evolution . secondly ,",
    "if one ignores @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath82 , @xmath81 reduce to those derived by begg and barnett using the truncated harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "this means that for two generalized weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebras characterized by different structure functions",
    "@xmath53 , we end up with the same phase states .",
    "thus , to differentiate between these states , the presence of @xmath5 is necessary in their forms . in this sense",
    ", it must be noticed that the @xmath6 phase states obtained in @xcite are similar to those of pegg and barnett despite the fact that the involved symmetries are different .",
    "hence , to avoid such problem we introduced @xmath5 that allows us to keep the trace of the symmetry and dynamics of the system under consideration . note also that @xmath5 plays a key role in relating phase states and mutually unbiased bases @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the effect of beam splitting on a known input state with the vacuum at the second port .",
    "we assume that the vertical input beam is always prepared in the fock ground state and the state of interest is the input state in the horizontal beam , which by convention precedes that of vertical beam .",
    "algebraically , the beam splitting transformation is described as follows .",
    "the input field described by the usual harmonic oscillator operator @xmath94 is superposed on the other input field with operator @xmath95 by a lossless symmetric beam splitter , with the transmission @xmath86 and reflection @xmath96 coefficients .",
    "the output field operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by @xmath99 where the unitary beam splitter operator of angle @xmath100 is @xmath101.\\ ] ] the action of @xmath102 on the state @xmath103 reads as @xmath104 where the transmission and reflection coefficients are defined by @xmath105    it is well known that among pure states of a single mode field , only harmonic oscillator or glauber coherent states do not become entangled upon beam splitting .",
    "indeed , for the 50:50 beam splitter with an ordinary glauber coherent state incident on one port and a vacuum on the other , the beam splitting result is a product of two glauber states .",
    "this procedure do not provides us with an entangled system .",
    "in general , any other pure state at the input results in an entangled state at the output .",
    "this explains how the beam splitter acts as entangler and why it is used in experiments as device to generate entangled states .",
    "now , let us proceed in our case to rewrite the action of the beam splitter operator on the phase states ( [ coherentstatemvarphi ] ) as @xmath106 the corresponding output density is then given by @xmath107 it follows that one can write the bipartite reduced density matrix @xmath108 , which is obtained by tracing out the second system .",
    "this is @xmath109 where label @xmath110 is reflecting the trace on second states .",
    "it is easy to see that the reduced density matrix is given by @xmath111 where the coefficients @xmath112 have the form @xmath113    next , we are interested in the amount of entanglement of the beam splitter output states . in doing so , we examine the entanglement of phase states when passed through a beam splitter by using the linear entropy @xcite @xmath114 clearly , it goes to zero for a pure state .",
    "after some algebra , we show that ( [ entropy ] ) rewrites @xmath115 where @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 and the phase term reads as @xmath118\\varphi.\\ ] ] we have some remarks in order .",
    "firstly , according to last equations we notice that the linear entropy is @xmath119-independent .",
    "secondly , one can verify that the functions @xmath120 satisfy some symmetries with respect to interchange of their quantum numbers .",
    "these are @xmath121 which can be used to express the linear entropy in terms of @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 together with the symmetry of the summations in ( [ linearentropy ] ) .    for the temporally stable phase states considered in section 3 , we study numerically the behavior of the first - order entropy as a function of the relevant parameters @xmath124 , @xmath5 and the reflection coefficient @xmath96 as well .",
    "we shall focus on the phase states associated with the generalized weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebra defined through the structure function @xmath125 we first plot the entanglement against @xmath5 and @xmath126 for different finite dimensional hilbert of @xmath34-dimensions .",
    "+ figure 1 : linear entropy of phase states as a function of @xmath127 and @xmath5 for @xmath128 .",
    "+ figure 2 : linear entropy of phase states as a function of @xmath127 and @xmath5 for @xmath129 .",
    "+ figure 3 : linear entropy of phase states as a function of @xmath127 and @xmath5 for @xmath130 .",
    "according to the above figures , we note that for all value taking by @xmath124 there is a maximum entanglement at the point @xmath131 , which corresponds to a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "furthermore , we have two interesting features in order .",
    "the first is that for qubits @xmath132 , the degree of entanglement is @xmath5-independent as shown in figure 1 .",
    "however , for qutrits @xmath133 and fixed reflection coefficient , the behavior of the linear entropy is gaussian .",
    "the maximum is reached for @xmath131 and @xmath134 , see figure 2 .",
    "this changes completely for higher dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "indeed , for @xmath130 , for fixed value of @xmath126 , the linear entropy undergoes an initial rapid increase to reach the maximum entropy for @xmath134 followed by a slower drop and then increases when @xmath5 does go to @xmath135 as it shown in figure 3 .    as we explained above",
    ", the parameter @xmath5 plays a key role in defining the phase states and ensuring the temporal stability of phase states .",
    "it follows that it is interesting to examine the linear entropy in term of @xmath5 for @xmath124 fixed and @xmath131 for which one has the maximum of entanglement of phase states .     + figure 4 : linear entropy of phase states after being passed through a 50:50 beam splitter against @xmath5 for @xmath136 .",
    "the behavior of linear entropy as function of the parameter @xmath5 is represented in figure 4 .",
    "it is easily seen that for @xmath137 , the linear entropy is constant .",
    "for qutrits , i.e. @xmath138 , the entropy looks like a gaussian with a maximum around @xmath139 . for higher levels quantum systems",
    ", the linear entropy behaves differently .",
    "for instance , with phase states of quartits , i.e. @xmath140 , the degree of entanglement increases for @xmath141 , decreases for @xmath142 and increases after .",
    "as the parameter @xmath5 is deeply related to time evolution of phases states , the figure 4 can be viewed as representing the temporal evolution of the degree of entanglement of phase states .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the linear entropy of phase states versus the parameter @xmath124 for different values of @xmath5 to underline its basic behavior .",
    "+ figure 5 : linear entropy of phase states after being passed through a 50:50 beam splitter against @xmath124 for different values of @xmath5 .    following this figure",
    ", we notice that the linear entropy initially rapidly rises for lower @xmath124 but increases slowly for @xmath143 .",
    "however for higher @xmath124 , the linear entropy does not approaches zero .",
    "this shows that the degree of entanglement is increasing when the dimension of the generalized weyl ",
    "heisenberg becomes large .",
    "the main idea of the present work is the investigation of the degree of entanglement of temporally phase states .",
    "the latter are constructed as eigenstates of a unitary phase operator resulting from the polar decomposition of ladder operators of finite dimensional weyl ",
    "heisenberg algebra . using the beam splitter as entangler , we computed the degree of entanglement of phase states by mean of linear entropy .",
    "we investigated the behavior of this quantity as function of the dimension of the hilbert space , the transmission - reflection coefficients of the beam splitter and the parameter ensuring the temporal stability of the phase states .",
    "it is clearly shown that the maximal entanglement is provided by 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "also , the entanglement increases with increasing dimension of the system .",
    "for instance the phase states for qutrits are more entangled than qubits .",
    "the entanglement of phase states when passed through a beam splitter is strongly dependent on the parameter @xmath5 which play an essential role in defining the eigenstates of the unitary phase operator and ensure their temporal stability .",
    "finally , we note that we did not consider the limiting case @xmath144 .",
    "in fact for infinite dimensional hilbert space , one can not define unitary phase operator in a consistent way .",
    "consequently the phase states associated with the ordinary weyl  heisenberg can not be constructed using the formalism developed in this work .",
