    "since its discovery , the stark effect , i.e. , the interaction of an atom with an external electric field @xmath3 , has played an important role in the spectroscopic investigation of atomic structure .",
    "because of parity conservation , the stark effect arises only in second order perturbation theory for atoms with non - degenerate orbital angular momentum states .",
    "the energy shift @xmath4 of a magnetic sublevel @xmath5 of the hyperfine structure is conventionally parametrized in terms of a polarizability @xmath6 as @xmath7 in second order perturbation theory the polarizability can be decomposed  @xcite into a scalar polarizability , @xmath8 , which leads to an @xmath0- and @xmath1-independent level shift , and a tensor polarizability , @xmath9 , which yields @xmath0- and @xmath1-dependent energy shifts .",
    "because of rotational symmetry , the tensor polarizability vanishes for the spherical @xmath10 and @xmath11 states in the alkalis . as a consequence , the second order stark effect in the alkali ground state does not affect its hyperfine splitting , nor does it lift the zeeman degeneracy of a given hyperfine level .",
    "however , haun and zacharias observed already in 1957  @xcite that a static electric field does induce a quadratic stark shift of the hyperfine transition frequency ( @xmath0-dependent stark effect ) , and in 1964 , lipworth and sandars  @xcite demonstrated that a static electric field also lifts the zeeman degeneracy within the @xmath12 sublevel manifold of the cesium ground state ( an @xmath13-dependent effect ) .",
    "improved measurements were performed later by carrico  @xcite and gould  @xcite , and were recently confirmed by our own measurements  @xcite . in 1967",
    ", sandars  @xcite showed that the @xmath0- and @xmath13-dependence of the stark effect can be explained when the perturbation theory is extended to third order after including the hyperfine interaction .",
    "his theoretical expressions for the third order tensor polarizabilties @xmath14 were evaluated numerically in  @xcite and  @xcite under simplifying assumptions .",
    "this yielded ( absolute ) values which were systematically larger than the experimental values for the five investigated alkali isotopes  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in cesium the level shifts due to @xmath14 are almost seven orders of magnitude smaller than the common shift of the ground state levels due to the second order scalar polarizability @xmath15 .",
    "while the scalar stark shift is understood at a level of @xmath16  @xcite , there has so far been no satisfactory theoretical description of the tensor polarizabilities , i.e. , of the @xmath13-dependent alterations of the scalar effect . in this paper",
    "we extend the previous theoretical treatment of the third order effects by including both diagonal and off - diagonal hyperfine interactions in the perturbation expansion .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the perturbation sum then yields a value of the cs ground state tensor polarizability @xmath17 which is in very good agreement with the experimental results  @xcite , thereby bridging the 40-year - old gap  @xcite between experiments and theory .",
    "we have also identified an error in sandars results  @xcite concerning the relative sign of the tensor polarizabilities of the two ground state hyperfine levels .",
    "we discuss the relevance of this sign error for the determination of the black - body radiation shift of primary frequency standards from measurements of the static stark shift of the cs clock frequency .",
