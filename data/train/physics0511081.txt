    "clays are layer type aluminosilicate minerals , existent everywhere in nature and industry , hence the importance of a detailed understanding of their physics and chemistry .",
    "they are used as building materials , ceramics , and catalysts ; they are employed in cosmetics , as rheological modifiers for paints , and in technological processes such us oil well drilling . in this last application ,",
    "the control of their stability is a key for drilling success . during it ,",
    "the use of water based muds induce destabilization of shale and clay formations that would disintegrate , or heave , upon contact with water .    one way to maintain stability of shales during the drilling process is by addition of potassium salts to drilling muds .",
    "this helps to avoid fluid loss and water infiltration .",
    "these kind of muds , that contain potassium ions dissolved in the water phase , are widely used for drilling water - sensitive shales , specially hard , brittle shales .",
    "potassium cations in these systems replace ions such as sodium found in most shales to produce less hydrated clays with significantly reduced swelling potential .",
    "these ions also help to hold the cuttings together , minimizing their dispersion into finer particles . from all of the previous facts ,",
    "a good understanding of the role of potassium in the swelling clays such as montmorillonite is mandatory , in particular at basin conditions of hard experimental implementation .    besides the experimental studies , computer simulations are essential components of research on clay - water - cation systems @xcite .",
    "these simulations give microscopic insights that are difficult to access experimentally .",
    "there are , however , not many computational studies on the swelling of montmorillonite hydrates for potassium interlayer cations @xcite . in addition , excluding hensen _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite and tambach _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite works , these papers report solely @xmath0 and @xmath2 simulations , where the number of water molecules per interlaminar space is someway arbitrarily fixed , and hence , they do not show the whole picture of swelling .",
    "a good example of this is that hysteresis is naturally predicted by sampling in an open ensemble @xcite , without the need of measuring properties such as water chemical potential @xcite , immersion energies @xcite , or swelling free energies @xcite . finally , this paper focuses on the stability of the different hydrates in contact with several reservoirs , which differ in temperature , pressure , and water activity .",
    "the importance of potassium as swelling inhibitor of clays and the above mentioned reasons motivated us to study the microscopic mechanisms underlying the behavior of k - montmorillonite hydrates at equilibrium with different reservoirs .",
    "we performed simulations of these systems in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ensembles , considering explicitly two clay layers in the simulation box to avoid finite size effects .",
    "the simulations were carried out for two condition sets .",
    "one at ground level , with p@xmath3 atm and t@xmath4k , and the other one with p@xmath5 atm and t@xmath6k , which corresponds to an average burial depth close to 4 km .",

    "a @xmath7 layer of wyoming type montmorillonite clay was built up by replication of the unit cell given by skipper _",
    "this layer has @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath9 and @xmath11 @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "the wyoming type montmorillonite was obtained by isomorphous substitutions of trivalent al atoms of the octahedral sites by divalent mg atoms , and tetravalent si by trivalent al atoms .",
    "the unit cell formula of this clay is given by k@xmath12@xmath13h@xmath14o(si@xmath15al@xmath16)(al@xmath17mg@xmath18)o@xmath19(oh)@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "size effects were avoided by considering two layers in the simulation box @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the three space directions .",
    "the initial configuration consists of water molecules randomly placed in the interlaminar spaces , and six potassium ions distributed in the interlayer midplanes .",
    "these counterions balance the negative charge of the clay framework keeping the system electroneutral .",
    "the rigid tip4p model was used for water molecules @xcite and the water clay interactions were taken from boek _",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ peaks ] shows the main peak positions and the first shell coordination numbers for the systems equilibrated at different relative vapor pressures , and for a single and a double water layer configurations .",
    "this was done to prove that the shifts of the water and clay peaks mentioned in the preceding section are indeed significant over a wide range of vapor pressures . as can be seen for the single layer hydrate ,",
    "the k - o water clay position is practically constant and equal to the one found from the @xmath0 sampling .",
    "also the double layer @xmath33 is close to the value found in the previous section , _",
    "i.  e. _ , similar to the k - o bulk water position . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath34 increases for increasing the relative water pressure , reaching a plateau for @xmath35 @xmath36 0.3 .",
    "the plateau value is close to 2.89 @xmath9 , which is also similar to the value found in the preceding section .",
    "the decrease of this distance with @xmath35 is a consequence of the decrease of the interlaminar distance with it . for the double layer configuration",
    "it is also confirmed a value close to 2.76 @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the shifts of these peaks are relevant , and not just casual values obtained for some particular conditions . from table",
    "[ peaks ] it is seen that the values for the coordination numbers also agree with those presented in the previous section .    to evaluate the effect of the burial depth on the k - montmorillonite swelling curves , figure [ mupt_swell_poz ] was built for @xmath37394 k and @xmath38600 atm .",
    "additionally , results for ground level conditions were included to make the comparison easy . as can be seen , for initial conditions of 10 water molecules and a small interlaminar space ,",
    "the interlaminar distance is slightly smaller than those obtained for ground level conditions .",
    "this combines with the fact that water molecules occupy a larger effective volume for burial conditions and so , the number of water molecules decreases . in other words , the single layer hydrate of k - montmorillonite dehydrates under burial conditions .",
    "furthermore , this single layer hydrate is stable even for a saturated water vapor pressure .",
    "again , this contrasts with the results we obtained for na - montmorillonite @xcite , where the single layer hydrate was found to be unstable for large water activities .",
    "moreover , for @xmath39 1.0 , the k - montmorillonite single layer hydrate yields 12.07 @xmath9 of interlaminar space and 40.4 water molecules , which seems to be far from the transition range of 45 to 55 water molecules previously found .",
    "the double layer hydrate behaves differently .",
    "that is , it keeps constant its water content and it slightly increases its interlaminar distance . as found for ground level conditions , it collapses forming the single layer hydrate for @xmath40 0.6 . on the other hand , for a saturated vapor pressure",
    "the system monotonically increases its amount of water as the simulation evolves . in this last case we stopped the simulations when reaching 180 water molecules , and",
    "thus , we assumed that the system entered the osmotic regime .",
    "in summary , these results indicate that once formed the k - montmorillonite single water hydrate will not be destabilized neither at ground level conditions nor at burial depths .",
    "in addition , if the reservoir vapor pressure fells down 0.4@xmath41 the single water hydrate will form .",
    "single and double layer hydrates of k - montmorillonite were studied by means of @xmath0 and @xmath1 simulations . for that purpose",
    "a hybrid monte carlo scheme was employed .",
    "most results from the @xmath0 sampling just confirm those previously reported elsewhere @xcite , suggesting that differences in models and methods are not very important .",
    "we found different clay - water - ion complexes for the single water hydrate .",
    "they consist of an average of 5 water molecules surrounding a potassium ion that additionally coordinates with two oxygen atoms of each closest clay layer .",
    "these potassium ions are placed at the interlayer midplane and so , distances between them and the oxygens of the clay are slightly larger than those observed for the double layer hydrate .",
    "it should be mentioned that these midplane ions were reported by previous works as forming outer - sphere complexes @xcite .",
    "in fact , chang _",
    "_ @xcite found that these midplane ions have a relatively large mobility , since potassium ions neither strongly coordinate to water molecules nor strongly interact with the clay surfaces .",
    "this is , indeed , characteristic of an outer - sphere complex .",
    "this explains why they call them in this way .",
    "nonetheless , the inner - sphere definition given elsewhere @xcite says literally the surface complex is inner - sphere if the cation is bound directly to a cluster of surface oxygen ions , with no water molecules interposed \" .",
    "accordingly , our midplane potassium ions form inner - sphere complexes but simultaneously with both clay layers .",
    "nevertheless , we expect them to have a diffusivity similar to that reported by chang _",
    "this is a clear difference between this kind of inner - sphere complex and the typical inner - sphere complex , where ions are strongly coordinated to one of the surfaces @xcite .",
    "this simultaneous coordination of potassium ions with oxygen atoms of the two adjacent clay layers plus their relatively large coordination distances , suggests to us that these complexes are attracting the clay layers toward the interlayer midplane , aiding to keep them together .",
    "although the previous finding seems to explain the stability of the single layer hydrate found experimentally , we should also reproduce computationally this behavior .",
    "hence , @xmath1 simulations were carried out .",
    "this ensemble lets interchange water with a given reservoir and volume fluctuations .",
    "so , for any given water vapor pressure of the reservoir , an average amount of water and an average interlaminar distance are found .",
    "however , two different equilibrium states may be produced , pointing to the formation of free energy local minima @xcite , which are accessed by handling initial conditions .",
    "this produces hysteresis loops @xcite .",
    "we found that for initial conditions close to the dehydrated state , a single water layer is always obtained for any non zero vapor pressure , signaturing its high stability .",
    "the amount of water of this single layer slightly increases as the vapor pressure increases .",
    "this was obtained for ground level and burial conditions .",
    "the interlaminar distance for the ground level state is always close to 12.0 @xmath9 .",
    "the number of water molecules was found to be close to 38 for ground level conditions and about 36 for burial conditions .",
    "this is due to the larger effective volume the water molecules occupy at higher temperatures .    on the other hand ,",
    "the stability of the double layer hydrate differs from that one of the single layer . for both conditions studied",
    ", it was seen that the double layer collapses to form the single layer for vapor pressures under 0.4@xmath41 .",
    "in addition , this double layer was found to be unstable for burial depth and for saturated vapor pressures , producing a hydrated state in the osmotic regime .",
    "we should point out that these results agree with those of boek _",
    "_ @xcite . in their figure 3",
    "is shown the potential energy of the interlayer water as a function of the number of water molecules .",
    "it can be seen that the potassium curve is very different than the sodium and lithium ones only for small amounts of water ( it shows much higher energy values , even well above the water bulk reference ) .",
    "this supports our finding of an extremely stable single water hydrate .",
    "nevertheless , they claim that potassium is a good swelling inhibitor due to its ability to migrate and bind to the clay surfaces for large amounts of water .",
    "hence , the negatively charged surface becomes screened , making its inherent repulsion less effective .",
    "we agree that this mechanism explains the relatively high stability of double layer hydrates , and even explains the stability of k - montmorillonite hydrates in the osmotic regime .",
    "nevertheless , it can not explain the remarkable stability of the single layer hydrate , since at least a double layer is needed to obtain the binding between ions and surfaces .",
    "this fact makes us think that midplane potassium ions are playing an important role in the stability of single layer hydrates .    despite of thinking that the potassium simultaneously binding to adjacent layers",
    "is the key to the single layer hydrate stability , we do not think it is the only factor .",
    "lowest interaction energy for the pair k - tip4p water is close to -20 kcal , which is higher than that for na - tip4p of approximately -25 kcal .",
    "this means that potassium ion does not strongly interact with water and therefore , it easily loses water from its coordination shell . in other words ,",
    "the water chemical potential of the interlayer is not very negative .",
    "that is , water may be more comfortable in bulk than in the interlayer , surrounding the ions . as mentioned by sposito",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , potassium ions show a kind of hydrophobic character \" , in the sense that they tend to interact with water molecules not only through their positive charge but also through solvent cage formation .",
    "consequently , some of the water oxygen atoms may be easily exchanged by oxygen atoms from the clay surface .",
    "finally , for drilling purposes and based on our results , it seems to not be enough to add potassium to the mud in order to guarantee the single layer water formation and , in this way , avoid swelling .",
    "one should simultaneously decrease the mud water activity to safely produce the single layer state .",
    "once obtained , the clay will not swell at all .",
    "this research was supported by instituto mexicano del petrleo grant d.00072 .",
    "different types of movements should be called randomly , otherwise detail balance is violated @xcite .",
    "the datapublished here and in references@xcite were obtained by following thissequential algorithm . however ,",
    "some data were checked by means ofthe corresponding random algorithm and the same results wereobtained ."
