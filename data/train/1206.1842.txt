    "fluctuations around equilibrium states of matter is a classical subject of statistical physics .",
    "close to equilibrium , fluctuations of macroscopic observables are fully described in terms of the free energy @xcite .",
    "an important recent advance is the elucidation of the behavior of fluctuations , including large deviations , of macroscopic observables in _ non - equilibrium steady states _ ( ness ) of driven lattice gases : simple diffusive transport systems with particle conservation @xcite .",
    "the distribution of fluctuations in the ness , as described by the large deviation functional @xcite , can exhibit qualitatively new features , such as non - locality and phase transitions , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "so far , large fluctuations in ness have only been studied in a very few simple lattice gas models .",
    "these studies , however , have greatly increased the general understanding of fluctuations around ness .    over the last decade a powerful framework , the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) of bertini , de sole , gabrielli , jona - lasinio , and landim @xcite , has been developed for the ness of diffusive lattice gases driven by reservoirs at the boundaries . the mft is a classical hamiltonian field theory @xcite which describes macroscopic fluctuations in these systems .",
    "the mft formalism is a further development of the low - noise freidlin - wentzell theory @xcite which in turn is a variant of the wkb ( after wentzel , kramers and brillouin ) approximation .",
    "a celebrated analog of the mft for continuous stochastic systems is the martin - siggia - rose field - theoretical formalism @xcite which has been employed in numerous works .",
    "related approaches for lattice gases deal , in addition to diffusive transport , with on - site reactions among particles @xcite .",
    "the mft has been successfully applied to ness in different systems @xcite , including those driven not from the boundaries .",
    "large fluctuations around ness have also been studied at the microscopic level using exact @xcite and numerical approaches .",
    "a perfect agreement between the predictions of the mft and the long - time asymptotes of the microscopic calculations has been observed whenever the results of the two approaches were available .    with the continuing progress in the studies of ness ,",
    "a natural next step is to probe fluctuations of macroscopic observables around _",
    "non - stationary _ states .",
    "fortunately , the mft framework is readily extendable to non - stationary settings , such as evolution of a step - like initial density profile @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a major technical hurdle which slows down the progress in using the mft for the analysis of both stationary and non - stationary problems .",
    "already in the simplest setting of a single species of particles , the mft involves two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations : the field - theoretical hamilton equations for the density field ( a  coordinate \" ) and a conjugate momentum field . with a few exceptions , these equations are not soluble analytically .",
    "still , there are several important factors that make the mft a viable alternative to other approaches :    1 .",
    "the mft is stripped off unnecessary details of microscopic interactions , so it directly probes the large - scale , long - time asymptotic regime that is of most interest .",
    "2 .   the mft provides the  optimal path \" : the density profile history which gives a dominant contribution to the probability of observing , say , a given current .",
    "3 .   the hamilton equations underlying the mft can be solved numerically with an iteration algorithm @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a numerical minimization of the mechanical action , intrinsic in the mft , can be performed @xcite .",
    "these numerical algorithms are much more computationally efficient than microscopic stochastic simulations .",
    "4 .   as we show here , a perturbative analytic solution is possible which probes , for a whole class of models , small fluctuations .",
    "the main objective of this work is to demonstrate these advantages .",
    "we will investigate , within the mft formalism , the noisy evolution of a step - like initial density profile in a class of lattice gas models in one dimension , where the transport is symmetric and diffusion - like .",
    "two non - trivial examples are the simple symmetric exclusion process ( ssep ) which has been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and the kipnis - marchioro - presutti ( kmp ) model @xcite .",
    "( in the ssep each particle can hop to a neighboring site at rate 1 if that site is unoccupied by another particle .",
    "if it is occupied , the move is forbidden .",
    "the kmp model is a one - dimensional chain of mechanically uncoupled harmonic oscillators which randomly redistribute energy among neighbors . )",
    "the step - like initial condition for the particle density , @xmath0 provides a good  litmus test \" for theory of fluctuations in non - stationary systems . as in refs .",

    "the precise mathematical formulation of the problem in the framework of the mft was given a few years ago @xcite , but the problem has defied solution except for the completely integrable case of non - interacting random walkers .",
    "our strategy here will be to solve the problem perturbatively around the noiseless hydrodynamic solution , thus probing typical , small fluctuations of the current .",
    "in addition , we will show how large current fluctuations can be efficiently simulated numerically .",

    "the variance of the total current , @xmath11 , also exhibits a diffusive growth with time : @xmath12 the quantity @xmath13 depends on the densities @xmath14 and , through @xmath15 , on the model .",
