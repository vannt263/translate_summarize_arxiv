    "( ref . ) have shown the existence of superconductivity at relatively high temperatures for alkali - metal - doped picene . in particular",
    ", k@xmath5picene shows a critical temperature of @xmath6 k. this work opens the door to a new class of materials that promise improved @xmath7 values . while the structure of the organic picene crystal is well known since 1985@xcite , the best possible structural determination using synchroton radiation on k doped samples has been indecisive about the actual positions of interstitial atoms @xcite . no further advance in the understanding of the superconductivity",
    "is possible until a successful detailed structural determination exists .",
    "once the atomic structure is known , both the electronic states and the phonons can be quantitatively studied and the usual ideas to understand superconductivity followed . a preliminary theoretical determination of the crystal structure of pristine and potassium doped picene ( k@xmath8picene ) has been reported by kosugi et al .",
    "@xcite by a first - principles calculation which adheres strictly to experimentally determined crystal parameters for the unit cell vectors length ( see also comment in ref . ) .",
    "kosugi et al .",
    "find that potassium doped picene molecules show an edge - to face intralayer ordering but stay almost perpendicular to the ab plane , losing the conventional herringbone interlayer stacking ( see fig .",
    "4a of the referred paper ) . in our work ,",
    "to circumvent the difficulties found in the experimental determination of the structure of k@xmath9picene ( small and disordered samples , possible existence of more than one structural phase , etc .",
    "@xcite ) we have adopted a more general strategy to the structural search of the crystalline structure of highly doped picene ; we rely on the best available _ ab initio _ methods based in density functional theory ( dft ) to get a stable structure that provides at least a local minimum of the free energy of a precise stoichiometry .",
    "we study the case of three potassium atoms per picene molecule because it is the one showing the higher critical temperature .",
    "therefore , in our calculation atomic positions and parameters defining the unit cell ( including the symmetry group ) have been fully optimized to reach a total energy minimum configuration subject to minimum forces and stresses .",
    "the resulting crystalline structure shows enough internal consistency and symmetry to be theoretically appealing .",
    "we remark that the calculated structure differs significatively from two different structures published for a smaller k doping of a similar material ( pentacene crystal ) @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives details for the computational procedure followed in this work .",
    "section iii presents our optimized crystalline structure and the corresponding electronic band structure and density of states .",
    "finally , section iv summarizes our conclusions .",
    "a full experimental determination of the doped picene crystal structure based in x - rays diffraction data has not been possible so far because of the large background and the small number of useful measured peaks .",
    "however , a basic le bail determination of the structure has been performed to obtain approximate values for the unit cell parameters@xcite , yielding values quite similar to the ones derived for pristine picene .",
    "therefore , we propose to complement the presently limited experimental information with a pure numerical procedure based in density functional theory to define realistic candidates for the actual crystalline structure .",
    "one important advantage is that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) show a robust geometry even in the presence of alkali metals and translate and rotate almost rigidly during the total energy minimization .",
    "however , the position of the dopant atoms is a complex problem not fully understood , as shown by previous theoretical studies concluding different alternative models@xcite . in order to get a plausible crystalline structure for k@xmath0picene",
    ", we have minimized the free energy per unit cell using a dft scheme at the local density approximation ( lda ) level .",
    "both atomic positions and cell parameters ( @xmath10 ) are free to change to minimize forces on atoms and stresses on the unit cell get .",
    "some more technical parameters of the computation follow .",
    "we use norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite , an energy cutoff of 660 ev , and monkhrost - pack@xcite meshes of @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending on the unit cell being under consideration .",
    "actual calculations have been performed with the castep program allowing for spin polarization of different bands of the doped crystal@xcite . to describe the exchange and correlation potential we use kohn and sham s local density approach as computed by ceperley and alder@xcite .",
    "maximum forces and stresses on the system are converged to target thresholds of @xmath13 ev /  and @xmath13 gpa .",
    "the whole procedure has been applied to pure picene as an overall check .",
    "the optimization was started using the complete structural determination provided by the cambridge crystallographic data centre ( csd_cif_zzzoyc01 ) .",
    "cell parameters ( @xmath14 ) change from ( 8.480   , 6.154   , 13.515   , 90.46@xmath15 ) to ( 8.373   , 6.043   , 13.390   , 90.18@xmath15 ) improving the cell total energy in merely @xmath16 ev . the unit cell volume shrinks about 4% , but the change in the molecule structure is imperceptible .",
    "therefore , the test is quite satisfactory and we assume that the differences between experimental and computational values provide an estimate for the errors involved in our structural search .",
    "fqz@xmath17 path followed to calculate the band structure is shown in red . ]          previous work on k - doped pentacene@xcite and on k@xmath0picene@xcite has proven that when large enough amounts of alkali atoms are introduced in a herringbone organic structure , the preferred positions for the dopants is intralayer , i.e. , in between planes defined by pah molecules .",
    "the other possibility , k atoms in the planes between pah layers is energetically less favorable but it has also been considered for k@xmath18pentacene@xcite . since we are mainly interested in the case of very high doping ( k@xmath0picene ) because it shows promising results as a new superconducting material , we have assumed from the beginning that k occupies sites between picene molecules . as a starting crystal structure ,",
    "we use pristine crystalline picene with k atoms in the centroids of next - nearest - neighbors parallel picene molecules@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the system is allowed to freely evolve under atomic forces obtained from a series of fully converged dft calculations to drive the molecules to equilibrium positions .",
    "we have performed three sets of different calculations : ( i ) we froze the unit cell parameters to the values obtained from a le bail x - ray analysis , ( ii ) values similar to the ones deduced from a le bail x - ray analysis , but relaxed by less than 10% in order to diminish the structural stress , and ( iii ) fully optimized values for the unit cell lengths and angles .",
    "the optimum configuration for the first case allows us to minimize the maximum component of forces on any atom below @xmath19 ev /  , but the maximum component of the tensor stress is @xmath20 gpa , and the total energy is above the global minimum found later by @xmath21 ev .",
    "the second case allows us to decrease @xmath22 gpa , but the total energy is still above the best configuration by @xmath23 ev .",
    "finally , the fully optimized structure ( @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 and , @xmath29 ) allows us to decrease the maximum force and stress below @xmath13 ev /  and @xmath13 gpa respectively .",
    "the lda cell volume increases from 669 @xmath30 for clean picene , to 730 @xmath30 after doping with potassium . even after a full optimization the system belongs to the space group @xmath31 and",
    "remains monoclinic within a @xmath32  error in the atomic positions .",
    "also @xmath33 at the precision of our computation .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that picene molecules acquire a small regular curvature that contrasts with the structure of the free molecule which is completely planar .",
    "[ estructura]a shows how k atoms are intercalated between the picene molecules that form a layer .",
    "the high - symmetry of the arrangement is clear .",
    "precise structural information is given in a supplementary _ cif_-like file @xcite .",
    "to understand the effect of different starting atomic configurations on the final equilibrium structure , we have looked at a laminar structure resembling intercalated graphite .",
    "the unit cell is made with two picenes and six potassium atoms too , but now the picene molecules are parallel .",
    "potassium goes to centroids between corresponding hexagonal rings . starting from this configuration ,",
    "dft forces lead to a locally stable structure in which picene molecules form a global plane whereas intercalated potassium completes a structure resembling the well known kc@xmath34 .",
    "the total energy of this structure is more than two ev per cell higher than the previous herringbone one .",
    "consequently , from a strict energetic point of view , it is clearly inferior .",
    "[ estructura]b shematically shows this laminar structure .",
    "again , precise structural information is given in a supplementary _ cif_-like file @xcite .",
    "the ultimate justification of a crystal structure should come from experiment , typically from x - ray diffraction .",
    "mitsuhashi et al .",
    "@xcite provide the x - ray diffraction pattern of a k@xmath9picene sample obtained with synchroton radiation of @xmath35in the supplementary information of their paper .",
    "we have used the mercury program@xcite to calculate a powder pattern for any well defined crystal structure .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ rayosx ] .",
    "first , we have checked that both the original picene crystal and the one refined by dft at the lda level provide spectra similar to the one given in ref . .",
    "second , we have used the same program to get the pattern for our predicted k@xmath0picene structure ( see fig .",
    "[ rayosx ] ) .",
    "it can be observed that the small angle part of the spectrum of doped picene resembles the one obtained for pristine picene in the herringbone structure .",
    "this is easily explained since the arrangement of picene molecules is still close to the original one . until here",
    "there is some agreement with experiment since mitsuhashi et al .",
    "comment that x - ray diffraction pattern of k@xmath9picene shows a good correspondence with that of pristine picene ( figs .",
    "s7a and s7b of ref . ) .",
    "nevertheless our well ordered array of k atoms produces important peaks at larger angles that have not been experimentally observed .",
    "we believe that k disorder , phase mixing , etc .",
    "prevent a better experimental determination of dopant positions and demand more research in the future .",
    "on the other hand , calculated powder pattern spectra allow us to discard alternative laminar stuctures because they systematically show the extintion of the ( 0,0,1 ) low angle peak .",
    "it is easy to check that the spectrum of potassium intercalated graphite ( kc@xmath34 ) shows a similar property .      the motivation behind the structural work is to better understand the electronic properties of the material .",
    "we compute the electronic density of states and the band structure for the optimized configuration using standard procedures in dft .",
    "[ bz ] gives some details of the brillouin zone form and orientation relative to the crystal lattice .",
    "also the path used to calculate the band structure is shown .",
    "[ dos ] gives results corresponding to the lda clean picene crystal ( upper panels ) and doped k@xmath0picene in the lda herringbone crystalline structure ( lower panels ) .",
    "the most significant feature of picene electronic structure is the opening of a wide gap ( about 2.5 ev in our approximation ) separating occupied ( valence ) states from empty ( conductance ) states .",
    "the upper right panel shows the bands that are close to the chemical potential .",
    "this result is in accordance with the insulating character of picene although the gap is underestimated in the local density approximation ( lda ) . after adding six potassium atoms per cell and assuming that the theoretically proposed crystalline structure is correct",
    ", the material presents the electronic structure shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "both valence and conduction bands are globally similar to the previous ones except for two new peaks appearing in the valence band , the first just above -30 ev and the second around -13 ev .",
    "they correspond to the fully occupied 3s and 3p states coming from potassium atoms .",
    "the valence electrons of k atoms have been transferred to the conduction band as the fermi level position indicates ( we have checked that the integral below the occupied part of the conduction band is precisely six ) .",
    "consequently , the potassium 4s states lie well above in the conduction band ( but are not shown in the figure ) and are completely empty .",
    "a closer look to the states that are occupied by k electrons in doped picene is given by fig .",
    "[ detalle ] .",
    "it is clear that the dispersion of the bands is larger in the doped material and consequently , the separation to the valence bands is smaller .",
    "notice also that dispersion along fq and z@xmath17 directions ( both parallel to @xmath36 axis ( @xmath4 * axis ) is more or less similar .",
    "although the assignment of wavefunctions weight to particular atoms or molecules is beyond the scope of this contribution , we believe that extended states of the doped material are similar to pristine picene wavefunctions but their energies are shifted by the new electrostatic potential induced from the transference of electrons from potassium to organic molecules . therefore , assuming that 4s k orbitals do not have a significant weight in the conduction band states , the existence of several weak ch/@xmath3 bonds @xcite among perpendicular picene molecules can explain the existence of extended states . on the other hand , the smaller h - h overlaps should provide the smaller delocalization along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "once changes in the electronic structure of picene due to the doping by k have been analysed , some conclusions can be inferred .",
    "first , the introduction of potassium gives rise to an ionic system in which long range coulomb forces contribute an important percentage of the whole cohesive energy .",
    "second , the broadening of the molecular levels of individual picene molecules likely comes from the original edge to face interactions of any herringbone arrangement plus the smaller interlayer coupling mediated by h - h overlap .",
    "consequently , the doped system presents extended states covering the whole crystal , but showing a reduced dispersion along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "this characteristic implies a smaller electric conductivity parallel to the @xmath4 axis in comparison with conductivities in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions .",
    "measurements mentioned by mitsuhashi et al .",
    "( ref . ) for doped pentacene share this property",
    "although physical grounds are quite different . in the last case , conductivity shows a two - dimensional character because doping occurs in @xmath37-@xmath38 planes allowing extended two - dimensional wavefunctions for the alkali metals .",
    "intercalation of k atoms inside the picene crystal is crucial to modify some properties of interest , e.g. superconductivity . in this subsection ,",
    "we use our structural and electronic calculations to compute diffusion barriers for k atoms moving inside the unit cell .",
    "the starting point are local equilibrium adsorption sites computed for a common unit cell that we choose to be the experimental one for clean picene@xcite ; this is a reasonable choice because of the low amount of potassium involved in these calculations .",
    "barriers are estimated from a linear synchronous transit ( lst ) transition state search , followed by a quadratic synchronous transit ( qst ) refinement@xcite .",
    "the global energy minimum for a single k in the picene unit cell is close to the central part of the channel defined by four picene molecules ( figs .",
    "[ estructura]a and [ barrier1k ] ) .",
    "we compute the diffusion barrier to move the k atom along the channel ( the displacement introduces new forces making the atom to get closer to one of the picene molecules by 0.6  ) .",
    "the energy of reaction when moving between these two local adsorption sites is 0.11 ev and the highest barrier ( from the initial position to the transition state ) is 0.13 ev ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this barrier is small enough as to predict a large diffusivity of k inside the picene crystal : we estimate this value from @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a typical attempt frequency that we take as the frequency of a plausible phonon ( e.g. , @xmath41 thz ) , b is the diffusion barrier for this particular hop from site i to site f , @xmath42 is temperature and @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this simple estimate shows that the potassium atom is making about @xmath44 hops per second at room temperature , making macroscopical diffusion in a reasonable amount of time possible .    for two k simultaneously diffusing in the unit cell many more configurations",
    "need to be explored making an extremely complex energy landscape .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ barrier2k ] two representative cases : starting out from the global minimum configuration where both k atoms stay near the center of the unit cell , both atoms diffuse either along the same or opposite directions ( mostly , both along the @xmath45 , or the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axis respectively ) .",
    "the lower barrier corresponds to the k atoms moving away from each other : 0.47 and 0.44 ev from the initial and final states respectively . for the _ concerted _ diffusion ,",
    "barriers are 0.61 and 0.33 ev respectively , and the initial and final states have a larger energy difference : 0.28 ev ( table [ table1 ] ) .    .",
    "barriers from the initial ( @xmath47 ) and final ( @xmath48 ) states , and energy of reaction ( @xmath49 ) for one and two k atoms diffusing in the unit cell ( primarily along the c direction ) . for two k atoms",
    "two different cases have been considered : a symmetric ( antisymmetric ) diffusion mode ( s or a , respectively ) where both atoms move along the same ( opposite ) directions . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "systematic use of dft allows the prediction of a plausible crystalline structure for heavily doped picene ( k@xmath0picene ) .",
    "potassium is absorbed in the square prism space defined by four equivalent picene molecules .",
    "the original herringbone structure formed by the organic molecules is only weakly deformed .",
    "this justifies the similarity of the x - ray powder spectra of the doped material and the pristine picene .",
    "nevertheless , our predicted structure do not quantitatively reproduce the experimental spectrum , mainly because the larger angle peaks originating in k are not present in experiment .",
    "the metallic character of the doped material comes from the occupation of picene wavefunctions due to the transfer of electrons from potassium to the organic molecules .",
    "the presence of k cations induce a modified electrostatic potential that broadens the lower part of the conduction band without appreciably changing the wavefunctions based on molecular orbitals of picene .",
    "therefore the reason for the intralayer dispersion of the bands is the ch/ @xmath3 interaction responsible for the herringbone pah arrangement . we should comment that this delocalization effect will be lost for separated parallel picene molecules , providing an important argument against alternative laminar structures . in view of these results ,",
    "we assume that superconductivity might be triggered by electron - phonon coupling _ within _ individual picene molecules .",
