    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) offers a picture of the early universe when it was only 400,000 years old .",
    "the cmb photons last scattered off electrons at that time and since then they traveled free through the space .",
    "the primordial perturbations set up during inflation are imprinted in both radiation and matter distribution .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies , related with the primordial perturbations , can be used to test some assumptions of the so called standard model . in particular",
    ", we can test the prediction of the standard , single field , slow roll inflation @xcite which states that the anisotropies are compatible with a nearly gaussian random field .",
    "other non - standard models of inflation predict detectable levels of non - gaussianity in the anisotropies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "primordial non - gaussianity of the local form is characterised by the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the primordial gravitational potential and @xmath7 is a linear random field which is gaussian distributed and has zero mean .",
    "there are many studies based on different statistical tools to constrain the local @xmath0 parameter from the cmb anisotropies , using the data of different experiments .",
    "we can mention the analyses using the angular bispectrum and wavelets on the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) data @xcite , the angular bispectrum on maxima data @xcite , the angular bispectrum on wmap data @xcite , different kind of wavelet analyses on wmap data @xcite , the minkowski functionals on boomerang data @xcite , the minkowski functionals on archeops data @xcite , the minkowski functionals on wmap data @xcite among others",
    ". we can also mention new promising techniques as for example one based on the @xmath8-point probability density distribution @xcite , and other based on needlets @xcite .",
    "other works are based on the use of the large scale structure to constrain @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this work is a continuation of the wavelet - based analysis by @xcite of the wmap data .",
    "we use high resolution wmap data maps , and compute the wavelet coefficients for 12 angular scales logarithmically spaced from 6.9 arcmin to 500 arcmin . with these wavelet coefficients",
    "we compute all the possible third order moments involving these scales .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "section [ method ] presents the estimators used to test gaussianity and to constrain @xmath0 , the data maps and the simulations .",
    "section [ results ] summarises the main results of this work and the conclusions are in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "this analysis is based on the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) as defined in @xcite . for references about the use of the smhw to test gaussianity in the cmb see for example the review by @xcite .",
    "we compute the wavelet coefficient maps at several scales @xmath9 logarithmically separated ( @xmath10 constant ) .",
    "the considered scales are : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we also include the unconvolved map , which will be represented by the scale @xmath22 as in @xcite . for each possible combination of three scales @xmath9 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( where the indices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 can be repeated ) we define a third order statistic @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total number of pixels of the map , @xmath30 is the number of pixels available after combining the extended masks corresponding to the three scales @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath31 is the wavelet coefficient in the pixel @xmath32 evaluated at the scale @xmath9 , and @xmath33 is the dispersion of @xmath34 .",
    "each map @xmath34 is masked out with the corresponding extended mask at the scale @xmath9 as in @xcite .",
    "for a set of @xmath8 scales we have @xmath35 $ ] third order statistics such as the one defined in eq .",
    "( [ statistic ] ) .",
    "we have tested with simulations that these statistics have a gaussian - like distribution .",
    "we can construct a vector @xmath36 of dimension @xmath37 @xmath38.\\ ] ] with this vector we can perform two different analyses using a @xmath39 statistic : one to test gaussianity and a second one to constrain @xmath0 ( eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8) of * ? ? ?",
    "we use the 5-yr wmap foreground reduced data , available in the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) web site .",
    "we combine the maps of different radiometers using the inverse of the noise variance as an optimal weight @xcite .",
    "in particular we analyse the v+w , q , v and w combined maps at a resolution of 6.9 arcmin , corresponding to a healpix @xcite @xmath40 .",
    "we use the @xmath4175 mask and also a set of extended masks for the wavelet coefficient maps .",
    "we use the same masks as the ones described in @xcite for a threshold of 0.01 .",
    "this corresponds to an available fraction of the sky from 71.2% for the @xmath42 scale to 31.4% for the @xmath43 scale .",
    "notice that larger scales have the restriction of a lower available area , which means a lower sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "finally we analyse the data and compare them with gaussian and non - gaussian simulations .",
    "the gaussian simulations are performed using the best fit power spectrum @xmath44 for wmap provided by lambda and the instrumental white noise of each wmap radiometer .",
    "the non - gaussian simulations with the @xmath0 contribution are computed following the algorithms described in @xcite and transformed into wmap maps with the instrumental noise included .",
    "we also estimate the unresolved point source contribution to @xmath0 for the v+w case by analysing point source simulations .",
    "these simulations have been generated as in @xcite following the source number counts @xmath45 given by @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the gaussianity analysis of the wmap data for the combined v+w , q , v , and w data maps .",
    "we also constrain @xmath0 for these maps through a @xmath39 test .",
    "we estimate the contribution of point sources to the v+w map . finally we constrain @xmath0 for northern and southern pixels separately .",
    ".@xmath39 constructed from the 364 statistics for v+w , q , v , and w data maps .",
    "[ stats_vw ] we also present the mean and the dispersion of the @xmath39 corresponding to 1,000 gaussian simulations , and the cumulative probability for the @xmath39 of the data obtained from the simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have tested the gaussianity and constrained the @xmath0 parameter with the 5-yr wmap data .",
    "we use an optimal wavelet - based test .",
    "we have considered the v+w , q , v and w combined maps at high resolution .",
    "we have used a set of 300 realistic non - gaussian simulations and thousands of gaussian simulations for the analysis .",
    "we have computed the wavelet coefficient maps at scales from 6.9 arcmin to 500 arcmin and computed all the possible third order moments ( eq . [ statistic ] ) using appropriate extended masks .",
    "the data are compatible with gaussian simulations for the considered combined maps ( see table [ stats_vw ] ) .",
    "we have imposed constraints on the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath0 by using non - gaussian simulations with @xmath0 .",
    "the results show that @xmath0 increases when we go from the q to the v and w combined maps .",
    "this frequency dependence also appears in the results by @xcite .",
    "the results are compatible with zero at 95% cl for the v+w , q , and v combined maps , but not for the w map ( which is compatible at 99% cl ) .",
    "this value can not be explained by unresolved point sources since their contribution is @xmath46 for the w map .",
    "we have estimated the probability of having those values with simulations and the results do not show incompatibility among different channels .",
    "we have also seen that the relatively large @xmath0 value obtained for the w band may come from systematics in one or several radiometers of this band .",
    "we have also estimated the contribution of unresolved point sources to @xmath0 for the v+w map using a realistic model given by @xcite .",
    "the results are @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account this value , our best estimate for @xmath0 is @xmath48 at 95% cl .",
    "the use of new scales and all the possible third order moments has returned better constrains to @xmath0 and lower error bars compared with the results by @xcite and previous works .",
    "our best estimate is compatible with the values obtained by @xcite and it excludes the best - fitting @xmath0 value obtained by @xcite at the @xmath399% cl .",
    "finally we have constrained @xmath0 for the north and south hemispheres and the results give two best - fitting values that are compatible with zero at 95% cl and also are compatible between them .",
    "therefore we do not find any north - south asymmetry for this parameter .",
