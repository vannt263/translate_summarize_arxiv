    "this paper brings together two ideas which are fundamental to the study of banach spaces of analytic functions .",
    "first , there is the classical paley  wiener theorem ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "this asserts that the laplace transform ( respectively , the fourier transform ) provides an isometric isomorphism between the space @xmath0 and the hardy space @xmath1 of the right - hand half plane @xmath2 ( respectively , the upper half plane ) .",
    "there are many generalizations of this result given , as mentioned below ; for example the weighted space @xmath3 corresponds to the bergman space @xmath4 .",
    "the strongest known generalization of this result is to the class of so - called zen spaces ( in fact we provide a slightly stronger generalization below ) , determined by an appropriate measure @xmath5 on the half - plane .",
    "+ the other theme that features in this paper is the notion of a carleson embedding . the classical carleson theorem is to do with finding a simple condition for the boundedness of the canonical injection @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a borel measure on @xmath2 , and has many applications in function theory and harmonic analysis ( again , @xcite is a good reference for this ) .",
    "the embedding theorem has also been generalized to the bergman space .",
    "+ bringing these ideas together , we characterise the boundedness of carleson embeddings for the very general class of zen spaces ( subject to a necessary technical condition on the measure @xmath5 ) , prove new results about the little hankel operators on these spaces , and discuss in addition those embeddings induced by the laplace transform .",
    "ultimately , this allows us to give precise results even in the case of @xmath8 for @xmath9 , when there is no exact generalization of the paley  wiener theorem .",
    "+ our results have applications in terms of interpolation in certain spaces of holomorphic functions and also admissibility and controllability in diagonal semigroups , as outlined in section  [ sec : applic ] .",
    "( full details will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "+ so , let @xmath10 denote a weight function on the imaginary axis @xmath11 , let @xmath7 be a positive regular borel measure on the right half plane @xmath2 and let @xmath12 .",
    "embeddings of the form @xmath13 where a locally integrable function @xmath14 on the imaginary axis @xmath11 is mapped to its poisson extension on the right half plane @xmath2 , are known as carleson embeddings , and have been much studied in the literature . in linear control ,",
    "another , related class of embeddings plays an important role , namely embeddings of the form @xmath15 given by the laplace transform @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the sobolev space of index @xmath18 and weight @xmath10 : the case @xmath19 corresponds to a weighted @xmath8 space .",
    "we shall refer to such embeddings as laplace  carleson embeddings .",
    "in the easiest case , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the laplace transform maps @xmath22 isometrically up to a constant to @xmath23 , which is a closed subspace of @xmath24 , and we only have to deal with the unweighted classical carleson embedding theorem for @xmath25 .",

    "the natural embedding @xmath26 is bounded for some ( or equivalently , for all ) @xmath27 .",
    "2 .   there exists a constant @xmath28 such that @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the _ carleson square _ @xmath34 .    in this case",
    ", @xmath7 is called a _",
    "carleson measure_.    a further relatively easy case is @xmath21 and @xmath10 a power weight , @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "this case corresponds to the classical embedding theorem for standard weighted bergman spaces on the half plane by duren , see e.g. @xcite . for more general weights @xmath10 , the laplace  carleson embedding corresponds to a new embedding theorem for weighted bergman spaces @xmath37 on the half plane with a translation - invariant measure @xmath5 , which is the subject of section [ sec : zen ] .    in the case of general @xmath38 , @xmath39 , the laplace",
    " carleson embeddings are very subtle even in case that @xmath40 , due to the oscillatory part of the laplace transform integral kernel .",
    "a general characterization seems out of reach at the moment , but with additional conditions on the support of the measure @xmath7 , a full characterization can sometimes be given .",
    "this is the content of section [ sec : pq ] .",
    "some applications are outlined in section  [ sec : applic ] .",
    "+ the reproducing kernel functions for @xmath23 are denoted by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath30 for @xmath43 , and satisfy @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 .",
    "we will also frequently use the poisson kernel @xmath47 which is related to the reproducing kernel @xmath41 by @xmath48",
    "in this section , we will be interested in embeddings @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a weighted bergman space defined below and @xmath5 is a translation - invariant positive regular borel measure on @xmath51 , that is , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes lebesgue measure and @xmath54 is a positive regular borel measure on @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of radial measures on the unit disc .",
    "the investigation of such embeddings has a long history , starting with @xcite for the case of the standard weighted bergman space on @xmath2 with @xmath56 for @xmath57 , respectively the standard weights @xmath58 on the disc .",
    "oleinik @xcite observed already in 1974 that for measures @xmath59 , where the weight @xmath60 decreases very fast towards @xmath61 , such as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , it is not sufficient to compare the weights of carleson squares @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( or equivalently , to compare the measures of euclidean balls @xmath66 centered on the imaginary axis )",
    ". instead , in the example above one has to consider the measures of euclidean balls away from the imaginary axis , @xmath67 for @xmath43 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the faster the weight @xmath68 decreases for @xmath69 , the smaller the radius of the ball @xmath70 in relation to the distance of @xmath71 to the imaginary axis , and the more detailed information on the measure @xmath7 is required .",
    "recently , necessary and sufficient conditions have been found for the case even faster decreasing weights @xmath68 , such as double exponentials @xcite .",
    "our aim in this section is somewhat different : we want to find a class of measures @xmath54 as large as possible , for which a characterisation in terms of carleson squares , and in terms of testing on powers of reproducing kernels @xmath72 , @xmath73 , is possible .",
    "our approach relies on a dyadic decomposition of the half - plane adapted to the measure which is somewhat technical , but has the advantage that no smoothness or continuity properties of the measure are required . clearly , we need a growth condition on @xmath54 in @xmath74 and the most natural condition to impose is the well - known @xmath75 ( doubling ) condition at @xmath74 .",
    "one motivation to treat this general setting , apart from the interest of carleson - type embedding theorems in their own right , is to obtain laplace - carleson embedding theorems on a large class class of weighted spaces @xmath76 ( see theorem [ thm : carllap ] below ) , which are important in control theory .",
    "this is exploited in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the general embedding theorem makes it also possible to study other important operators of analytic function spaces , such as hankel operators and volterra - type integration operators , in a more general setting .",
    "such operators on weighted bergman spaces for various classes of weights have for example been studied in @xcite , @xcite and recently in @xcite , @xcite . as an example of this type of application , we study little hankel operators on zen spaces in subsection [ sec:2.2 ] .",
    "let @xmath54 be a positive regular borel measure on @xmath55 satisfying the following @xmath75-condition : @xmath77    this is sometimes referred to as a _ doubling condition _ , and",
    "such measures have been studied in the theory of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations for many years ( an early reference is @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be the positive regular borel measure on @xmath78 given by @xmath79 , where @xmath53 denotes lebesgue measure . in this case , for @xmath80 , we call @xmath81 a _ zen space on @xmath2_. if @xmath82 , then by standard hardy space theory , @xmath83 has a well - defined boundary function @xmath84 , and we can give meaning to the expression @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we may write @xmath86 note that this expression makes sense in the case that @xmath87 ( e.g. the bergman space ) , since @xmath14 is still defined @xmath5-a.e .  on @xmath51 .",
    "clearly the space @xmath37 is a hilbert space .",
    "well - known examples of zen spaces are hardy space @xmath88 , where @xmath54 is the dirac measure in @xmath74 , or the standard weighted bergman spaces @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "some further examples constructed from hardy spaces on shifted half planes were given by zen harper in @xcite .",

    "if @xmath211 is of type 1 , then @xmath215 by construction , and @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , by decomposing the carleson square @xmath217 into @xmath218 and iterating if necessary , we see that we have to check condition 3 only for carleson squares @xmath217 with @xmath211 of type 2 or type 3 .",
