    "a most profound concept in quantum physics is quantum coherence .",
    "the first order version of quantum coherence can be directly manifested by the superposition of two quantum states .",
    "this is quite similar to the optical coherence in young s double experiment . from the standpoint of the photon- detection theory by glauber",
    ", this simple coherence can be mathematically depicted by the first order correlation function @xcite . however , in quantum mechanics , this first order coherence phenomenon does not sound very marvellous since the same circumstance can also occur in a classical case , such as the optical interference in the above mentioned young s double experiment .",
    "in fact , by the the first order correlation function only , it is impossible to distinguish the natures of a laser light field and a conventional light field with identical spectral properties . as an effective remedy , glauber s @xmath0-th order quantum correlation function , which accounts for various intrinsic ( @xmath0-th order ) quantum coherence effects , such as the intensity - intensity correlation measurement in the hanbury - brown - twiss experiment@xcite ,",
    "was introduced @xcite . indeed , this function reflects the intrinsically quantum features of coherence beyond the classical analogue .",
    "the quantum coherence embodies the wave nature in the world of microscopic particles . on the other hand",
    ", it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed by a `` which - path(way ) '' experiment @xcite , or by an environmental interaction .",
    "this phenomenon of destruction of coherence is usually referred to as quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of losing the coherence described by the first order correlation function is defined as the first order quantum decoherence .",
    "motivated by the considerations in fundamental quantum measurement problem @xcite , and also by the attempts to preserve quantum coherence of qubits in quantum computing @xcite , many recent experimental and theoretical investigations have been focused on revealing the physical mechanism of the decoherence problem , e.g. , see @xcite . according to these studies , this first order decoherence can be roughly understood through the quantum entanglement of the considered system with the environment or the measuring apparatus .",
    "obviously , this entanglement implies a `` which - path(way ) '' detection @xcite in the single particle picture . precisely speaking , in an initial coherent superposition @xmath1",
    ", each system state @xmath2 corresponds to a `` path '' and many `` two path '' interferences are reflected in the square norm of the spatial wave function @xmath3.thus by considering @xmath4 the quantum coherence can be captured to some extent .",
    "after the interaction , each `` path '' is correlated with an environment state @xmath5 to form an entangling state latexmath:[$|\\psi_t\\rangle = \\sum c_n|n\\rangle \\bigotimes    distinguish among the `` paths''of different @xmath2 and thus record the information of each `` path '' .",
    "the interference terms in the spatial intensity @xmath7 will disappear when the environment states @xmath5 are completely distinct , i.e. , @xmath8 . in that case",
    "each path is labeled by an environment state .",
    "the above well - known explanation of the first order decoherence in terms of `` which - path(way ) '' detection mechanism is simple but very profound .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether this mechanism can be used to elucidate the @xmath0th order quantum decoherence ( n - qdc ) , the destruction of quantum coherence described by glauber s @xmath0th order correlation function .",
    "the difficulty is we do not exactly know what are the `` paths '' and the corresponding `` which - path '' detection .",
    "most recently , we have touched the second order quantum decoherence problem @xcite bypassing this difficulty . as a matter of fact , in our treatment",
    ", we did not define the concept of `` path '' directly . the concrete calculation in the ref .",
    "@xcite motivated us to consider the `` which - path '' picture of the higher order quantum decoherence in general .    in our present investigation",
    ", it is crucial to show , we notice that , for a close system , in some cases glauber s @xmath0th - order correlation function is the square norm of the @xmath0th - order `` multi - particle wave amplitude '' , which will be defined later in this paper , while for an open system , it can become a sum of the square norms of the @xmath0th - order `` multi - particle wave amplitude '' over the states of an environment or an apparatus interacting with this open system .",
    "this observation is crucial in our present investigation . as an effective wave function",
    ", this multi - particle amplitude can be shown to be a supposition of many generalized `` paths '' ( the multi- particle paths or simply multiple paths ) .",
    "thus , the higher order coherence may be understood as the interference of multiple particle amplitudes . with this conception",
    "a generalized `` which - path '' detection may be established in terms of `` multi - particle paths '' as the physical mechanism of higher - order decoherence for some examples .    in section @xmath9",
    ", we will briefly explain glauber s @xmath0th order quantum coherence in terms of the single and multi photon effective wave functions used in @xcite .",
    "as their generalizations , in section 3 the concepts of multi - particle path and multi - particle wave amplitude are introduced for both close and open bosonic systems .",
    "especially , the @xmath0th order correlation functions of bosonic systems will be studied . in section 4 , an interacavity model with two bosonic modes",
    "is used to demonstrate @xmath9-qdc as a `` which - path '' detecting process . in section 5 , the exact solution obtained in the appendix is utilized to show the dynamical process of @xmath9-qdc , which is caused by the entanglement with the environment or an apparatus and indeed can be explained as a generalized `` which - path '' measurement for the explicitly -defined multi - particle paths .",
    "in quantum mechanics , a pure state is a superposition @xmath10 of many components @xmath11 , but the corresponding mixture @xmath12 can describe the same classical probability distribution @xmath13 however , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represents different quantum realities .",
    "usually it is said that the two components of a pure state is more coherent than those of a mixed one .",
    "this coherence property is obviously reflected by the intensity interference of two `` paths '' corresponding to the two components in the quantum state .",
    "for the system of one particle , only single particle property is relevant for this observation . in this sense ,",
    "only the intensity interference experiment is essential for one particle system . for many particle system , however , there exist many experiments ( such as the hanbury - brown - twiss experiment and the intensity - intensity correlation measurement ) to show the much richer natures of quantum coherence .    in order to study quantum coherence in many particle system ,",
    "glauber introduced the so - called @xmath0-th order quantum correlation function ( @xmath0-qcf )    @xmath16 = tr[\\hat{\\rho}e_{\\alpha _ 1}^{\\dagger } ( t_1)e_{\\alpha _ 2}^{\\dagger } ( t_2)\\cdots e_{\\alpha _ n}^{\\dagger } ( t_n)e_{\\alpha _ n}(t_n)\\cdots e_{\\alpha _ 2}(t_2)e_{\\alpha _ 1}(t_1)],\\ ] ]    for the electro - magnetic field @xmath17 in different mode @xmath18 . here , @xmath17 is the annihilation operator of mode @xmath19 at time @xmath20 in the heisenberg picture , @xmath21 is the corresponding conjugate operator , and the density matrix @xmath22 represents the initial state of many - mode electro - magnetic field",
    "of course , this formalism can also be used to study the coherence property for any quantum many - body system .    furthermore , to describe the higher order coherence ,",
    "glauber also defined the @xmath0th - order coherence function in the form @xcite    @xmath23 = \\frac{tr[\\hat{\\rho}e_{\\beta _ 1}^{\\dagger } ( t_1)e_{\\beta _ 2}^{\\dagger } ( t_2)\\cdots e_{\\beta _ n}^{\\dagger } ( t_n)e_{\\alpha _ n}(t_n)\\cdots e_{\\alpha _ 2}(t_2)e_{\\alpha _ 1}(t_1)]}{\\sqrt{g[\\alpha _ 1,t_1;\\alpha _ 2,t_2;\\cdots ; \\alpha _ n , t_n]}\\sqrt{g[\\beta _",
    "1,t_1;\\beta _ 2,t_2;\\cdots ; \\beta _ n , t_n]}},\\ ] ]    obviously , this coherence function is defined by a ratio of the off - diagonal elements of the reduced multi - time density matrix @xmath24to its diagonal ones .",
    "it is easily observed from this definition that these off - diagonal elements represent the coherence effect , and each one @xmath25 correlates two diagonal ones @xmath26and @xmath27 thus , we can understand the coherence function as measuring the degree of coherence for the two diagonal elements , which correspond to two different `` paths '' . from this point of view",
    ", there is obviously no quantum coherence for a completely mixed state with vanishing off - diagonal elements . in the following discussion",
    ", we will give simple examples to illustrate this viewpoint .",
    "now let us turn to an instance @xcite from which we can see clearly how the higher order quantum coherence effects given by @xmath9-qcf is revealed in the multi - particle picture .",
    "for a single photon , the coherent superposition @xmath28 of two states with opposite wave vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 possesses the first order quantum coherence which can be described by the interference fringes @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the photon field operator with positive frequency for the annihilation operator @xmath33 . it should be noticed that the diagonal element @xmath34 of the first order correlation function is just the square norm of the single photon wave - packet @xcite @xmath35 therefore , @xmath36 represents the interference between the `` two paths '' @xmath37 and @xmath38 this just developes the corresponding concept in young s double experiment for quantized light field .",
    "the above reformulation of the first order quantum coherence implies that `` two paths '' are necessary for the interference phenomenon .",
    "if we consider the two particle state @xmath39 with a single component , an interesting situation arises where the first order quantum coherence does not appear , but we can see the second order effect through the second order quantum correlation function @xmath40\\}.\\ ] ] unlike the case of first order coherence , in this case there do not appear the obvious two or many `` paths '' .",
    "nevertheless , the interference phenomenon can still be captured in a similar way with the introduction of generalized `` path '' .",
    "we understand the generalized `` path '' as described by the `` two time '' correlation function @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the `` two - photon wave function '' @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath45 was invoked as a two photon effective wave - function , and it was also called the biphoton wave packet for the photon field @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "especially , we remark that the biphoton wave packet @xmath43 is a coherent superposition of two `` probability amplitudes '' corresponding to two `` two - photon paths '' @xmath47 and @xmath48    starting from glauber s standpoint and proceeding along , we come to the conclusion that a set @xmath49|n=1,2, ... \\}$]of correlation functions , rather than a single one , is indispensable to describe comprehensively the wave - particle dual nature in the quantum world of many particle system .",
    "the above example of second order coherence shows that the conception of two - path interference in single photon picture still works with a proper generalization of the concept of `` path '' .",
    "hence it is quite natural to seek a generalized `` which - path(way ) '' measurement as the mechanism of higher - order quantum decoherence .",
    "in this section the conception of two photon effective wave - function will be generalized .",
    "it will be applied to the study of general quantum systems of identical particles .",
    "we first discuss the spatially - homogeneous case for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we consider a homogeneous bosonic field with two modes @xmath50 and @xmath51 is an annihilation operator with respect to the superposition state @xmath52 here , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the annihilation operators of the boson system ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfy the normalization relation @xmath57 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath58 .",
    "this means we consider the measurement to detect the polarized boson along the 45@xmath59 direction in the @xmath60 plane .",
    "we call @xmath61 a `` measuring '' operator .    corresponding to @xmath61 , the generalized second order correlation function @xcite @xmath62 can be understood in terms of the two `` paths '' picture from the initial state @xmath63 to the final state @xmath64 :    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in terms of the effective @xmath65-time - wave function defined above , the third order correlation function is explicitly written down : @xmath66 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cos [ ( \\omega _ v-\\omega _ h)(t_3-t_1)]+\\cos [ ( \\omega _ v-\\omega _ h)(t_2-t_3 ) ] )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it shows the quantum interference in the time - domain .    the above analysis is valid only for the case where the considered system is isolated from an environment and not measured by a detecting apparatus - a detector . for our purpose , we need to consider an open system @xmath67 interacting with an environment ( reservoir ) or a detector @xmath68 , and we must extend the concepts of multi - particle(time)-wave functions and the corresponding many - particle paths defined above . to do the generalization , we first invoke the effective field operator @xmath69 where @xmath70 has been given by eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "then instead of the free time evolution governed by the free hamiltonian @xmath71 , we use the evolution operator @xmath72 governed by the total hamiltonian @xmath73 taking into account the role of the interaction between @xmath68 and @xmath67 . here , @xmath74 is the free hamiltonian for @xmath75 if we only consider an ideal quantum decoherence process without dissipation , @xmath76 should possess the nature of quantum non- demolition : @xmath77=0 $ ] @xcite .",

    ", we observe that for a specially - given initial state , a higher order correlation function may be explicitly written down as the norm square ( or its sum ) of the multi - time - wave function , which is a coherent superposition of several complex components associated with the generalized many - particle paths .",
    "it is pointed out that this kind of many - particle path is not a simple - product of single - particle paths , but it can be determined by the specially designed measurement .",
    "in this section , an intracavity model is presented to demonstrate in multi - particle picture the `` which - path '' detection associated with higher - order quantum decoherence .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",

    "the concrete calculation in the ref.@xcite shows that the @xmath9-qdc effects can indeed be observed in the proposed experiment .",
    "but it involves dissipation effect losing energy .",
    "however , it is well known that quantum decoherence can still occur for an energy conserving system . so in principle dissipation is not indispensible for the discussion about decoherence effect . for this reason it is natural and interesting to consider pure decoherence process without dissipation .",
    "the pure decoherence can be well understood through the quantum entanglement of the considered system with the environment or the measuring apparatus . for a model with pure decoherence process , many concepts ( such as multi - particle path and the corresponding which - path detection )",

    "this is just the physical cause of the second order quantum decoherence . in the following section an explicit calculation of the second order correlation function",

    "<S> the classic example of the destruction of interference fringes in a `` which - way '' experiment , caused by an environmental interaction , may be viewed as the destruction of first - order coherence as defined by glauber many years ago @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we refer to this phenomenon as the @xmath0th - order decoherence . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that , just as the first - order coherence can be understood as the interference of the amplitudes for two distinct paths , the higher order coherence may be understood as the interference of multiple amplitudes corresponding to multiple paths . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the concept of @xmath0th - order `` multi - particle wave amplitude '' . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the @xmath0th - order correlation function can be expressed as the square norm of some `` multi - particle wave amplitude '' for the closed system or as the sum of such square norms for the open system . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine , as a specific example , how an environment can destroy the second order coherence by eliminating the interference between various multiple paths . </S>"
