    "<S> the rare decay @xmath1 and the search for new physics through this channel is also affected by this effect , which enhances the standard - model reference value of the branching ratio by @xmath2 , while the effective lifetime offers a new observable to search for physics beyond the standard model that is complementary to the branching ratio .    </S>",
