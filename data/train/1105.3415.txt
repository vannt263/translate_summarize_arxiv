    "despite the underlying complexities of earthquake dynamics and their complex spatiotemporal behavior  @xcite , celebrated statistical scaling laws have emerged , describing the number of events of a given magnitude ( gutenberg - richter law )  @xcite , the decaying rate of aftershocks after a main event ( omori law )  @xcite , the magnitude difference between the main shock and its largest aftershock ( bath law )  @xcite , as well as the fractal spatial occurrence of events  @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that scaling recurrence times according to the above laws results in the distribution collapsing onto a single curve  @xcite . however , while the fractal occurrence of earthquakes incorporates spatial dependence , it appears to embed isotropy in the form of radial symmetry , while the occurrence of real - world earthquakes is usually anisotropic  @xcite .    to better characterize this anisotropic spatial dependence",
    "as it applies to such heterogeneous geography , network approaches have been recently applied to study earthquake catalogs  @xcite . these recent network approaches",
    "define links as being between successive events , events close in distance  @xcite , or being between events which have a relatively small probability of both occurring based on three of the above statistical scaling laws  @xcite .",
    "these methods define links between singular events .",
    "in contrast , we define links between locations based on long - term similarity of earthquake activity .",
    "while earlier approaches capture the dynamic nature of an earthquake network , they do not incorporate the characteristic properties of each particular location along the fault .",
    "various studies have shown  @xcite that the interval times between earthquake events for localized areas within a catalog have distributions not well described by a poisson distribution  @xcite , even within aftershock sequences  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that each area not only has its own statistical characteristics  @xcite , but also retains a memory of its events  @xcite . as a result",
    ", successive events may not be just the result of uncorrelated independent chance but instead might be dependent on the history particular to that location . if prediction is to be a goal of earthquake research , it makes sense to incorporate interactions due to long - term behavior inherent to a given location , rather than by treating each event independently .",
    "we include long - term behavior as such in this paper by considering a network of locations ( nodes ) and interactions between them ( links ) , where each location is characterized by its long - term activity over several years .",
    "for our analysis , we utilize data from the _ japan university network earthquake catalog _ ( junec ) , available online at http://wwweic.eri.u - tokyo.ac.jp / catalog / junec/. we choose the junec catalog because japan is among the most active and best observed seismic regions in the world . because our technique is novel , this catalog provided the best avenue for employing our analysis . in the future",
    ", it may be possible to fine - tune our approach to more sparse catalogs .",
    "the data in the junec catalog span 14 years from 1 july 1985 - 31 december 1998 and are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : actmap ] .",
    "each entry in the catalog includes the date , time , magnitude , latitude , and longitude of the event .",
    "we found the catalog to obey the gutenberg - richter law  @xcite for events of magnitude 2.2 or larger . by convention ,",
    "this is taken to mean that the catalog can be assumed to be complete in that magnitude range .",
    "however , because catalog completeness can not be guaranteed for shorter time periods over a 14-year span , we also examine gutenberg - richter statistics for each non - overlapping two - year period ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr_by_year ] )  @xcite .",
    "we find that , though absolute activity varies by year , the relative occurrences of quakes of varying magnitudes does not change significantly for events between magnitude 2.2 and 5 , where there is the greatest danger of events missing from the catalog .",
    "additionally , the data are spatially heterogeneous , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : actmap ] .",
    "most events take place either over land or off japan s east coast .",
    "we remark to the reader that this is not an artifact of more detection equipment being located on land .",
    "the primary means for locating and detecting earthquake events involves using the s - waves and p - waves that emanate from the events .",
    "seismic stations are capable of detecting these waves a great distance from their source .",
    "both s - waves and p - waves  @xcite travel through the earth s mantle , and the characteristic absorption distance , defined as the distance for wave amplitude to drop to @xmath0 of its original value , for body waves is on the order of 10,000  km  @xcite .",
    "any event of magnitude 5.5 or larger , for example , is detectable anywhere on earth .",
    "hence , the location of the detection equipment does not affect how accurately events are catalogued . additionally ,",
    "because the location of the japanese archipelago is a consequence of seismic activity involving the philippine and other tectonic plates , it is not surprising that most seismic events take place on or near the islands themselves .",
    "we partition the region associated with the junec catalog as follows : we take the northernmost , southernmost , easternmost , and westernmost extrema of all events in the catalog as the spatial bounds for our analysis .",
    "we partition this region into a 23 @xmath1 23 grid which is evenly spaced in geographic coordinates .",
    "each grid square of approximate size 100  km @xmath1 100  km is regarded as a possible node in our network .",
    "results do not qualitatively differ when the fineness of the spatial grid is modified , in agreement with analogous work carried out by ref .",
    "@xcite , using a different technique from ours  @xcite . however , 100  km boxes are a more physical choice , as 100  km is on the order of rupture length associated with earthquakes  @xcite , which in turn is roughly equivalent to the aftershock zone distance for larger earthquakes  @xcite .    for a given measurement at time @xmath2 , an event of magnitude",
    "@xmath3 occurs inside a given grid square .",
    "similar to the method of corral  @xcite , we define the signal of a given grid square to form a time series @xmath4 , where each series term @xmath5 is related to the earthquake activity that takes place inside that grid square within the time window @xmath6 , as described below .",
    "because events do not generally occur on a daily basis in a given grid square , it is necessary to bin the data to some level of coarseness .",
    "how coarse the data are treated involves a trade - off between precision and data richness .",
    "we define the best results as those corresponding to the most prominent cross - correlations . to this end",
    ", we choose 90 days as the coarseness for our time series .",
    "this choice means that @xmath5 will cover a time window of @xmath7 days and @xmath8 will cover the 90-day non - intersecting time period immediately following , giving approximately 4 increments per year .",
    "additional analysis shows that results do not qualitatively differ by changing the time coarseness .",
    "we refer to the time series @xmath4 belonging to each grid cell @xmath9 as that grid cell s signal .",
    "we define the signal that is related to the energy released in the the @xmath9 grid cell by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the number of events that occur in @xmath2th time window in grid square @xmath9 .",
    "we choose this definition because the term @xmath12 is proportional to the energy released from an earthquake of magnitude m  @xcite .",
    "the signal therefore is proportional to the total energy released at a given location in a 90-day time period  @xcite .    to define a link between two grid squares ,",
    "we calculate the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient @xmath13 between the two time series @xmath14 associated with those two grid squares @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 indicates the mean and @xmath17 the standard deviations of the time series @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the two grid squares linked if @xmath13 is larger than a specified threshold value @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is a tunable parameter .",
    "as is standard in network - related analysis , we define the degree @xmath19 of a node to be the number of links the node has .",
    "note that our signal definition eq .",
    "[ signal ] involves an exponentiation of numbers of order 1 .",
    "this means that the energy released , and therefore the cross - correlation between two signals , is dominated by large events .",
    "examples of signals with high correlation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signals ] .    to confirm the statistical significance of @xmath13",
    ", we compare @xmath13 of any two given signals with @xmath13 calculated by shuffling one of the signals .",
    "we also compare @xmath13 with the cross - correlation @xmath20 we obtain by time - shifting one of the signals by varying time increments @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    where @xmath21 is in units of 90 days .",
    "further , we impose periodic boundaries    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the length of the series .",
    "our justification for these boundaries is that events in the distant past ( @xmath2510 years ) should have nominal effects on the present , while they also provide typical background noise for comparison .",
    "we note that over 14-year time period 1985 - 1998 , the overall observed activity increases in the areas covered by the catalog . to ensure that the @xmath13 values we calculate are not simply the result of trends in the data , we compare our results to those obtained with linearly detrended data  @xcite .",
    "we find that the trends do not have a significant effect .",
    "for example , using @xmath26 , we obtain 815 links , while detrending the data results in only 3 links dropping below the threshold correlation value . for @xmath27",
    ", we obtain 1003 links , while detrending results in only 3 links dropped .",
    "additionally , after detrending , 94% of correlation values stay within 2% of their values .",
    "as described above , we compare @xmath28 of eq .",
    "[ rtilde ] between signals at different locations at the same point in time with @xmath20 and with with correlation coefficient obtained by shuffling one of the series .",
    "shuffling or time - shifting by a single time step ( representing 90 days ) reduces @xmath29 to within the margin of significance , as shown in fig .  [ fig : correlcompare ] . shuffling",
    "the signal also reduce s we find a large number of links with cross - correlations far larger than their shuffled counterparts .",
    "the number of links exceeds that of time - shuffled data by roughly 3@xmath30 - 8@xmath30 , depending on choice of @xmath18 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : synth ] ( a ) .",
    "however , as shown , there are still many links that can be regarded as the result of noise .",
    "we therefore further examine the difference between the number of links found in time - shuffled data and the number found in the original data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : synth ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we find that the fraction of `` real '' links in general increases with @xmath18 .",
    "a significant fraction of these links connect nodes farther apart than 1000  km , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that there is no characteristic cut - off length for interactions between events  @xcite , corroborated by fig .",
    "[ fig : possible ] , showing the number of links a network has at a given distance as a fraction of the number of links that are possible from choosing any two nodes in the potential network .",
    "distances shorter than 100  km have sparse statistics due to the coarseness of the grid while distances greater than 2300  km have sparse statistics due to the finite spatial extent of the catalog . within this range , the fraction of links observed drops off approximately no faster than a power law .",
    "we find qualitatively similar results when we adjust the grid coarseness .",
    "our results , shown in fig .  [ fig : map2 ] , are anisotropic , with the majority of links occurring at approximately 37.5 degrees east of north .",
    "this is roughly along the principal axis of honshu , japan s main island , and parallel to the highly active fault zone formed by the subduction of the philippine and pacific tectonic plates under the amurian and okhotsk plates respectively .",
    "high degree nodes ( i.e.  nodes with a large number of links ) tend to be found in the northeast and northcentral regions of the junec catalog and are notably not strongly associated with the locations in the catalog that are most active , which we discuss in further detail below .    in network physics , we often characterize networks by the preference for high - degree nodes to connect to other high - degree nodes .",
    "the strength of this preference is quantified by the network s assortativity , defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the pearson correlation coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ prsn ] ) . the series @xmath33 and @xmath34 are found as follows : iterating through all entries @xmath35 in the adjacency matrix  @xcite , the degree of each node @xmath36 is appended to the series @xmath37 and the degree of the node @xmath38 that @xmath36 is linked to is appended to the series @xmath39 .",
    "the assortativity coefficient thus gives a correlation of node degree within the network .",
    "if each node of degree @xmath19 connects only to nodes of the same degree , the two series @xmath37 and @xmath39 will be identical and a=1",
    ". networks like the network of paper coauthorship have positive assortativity , while those of the world - wide web and of many ecological and biological systems have negative assortativity  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : assort ] shows that the networks resulting from our procedure are highly assortative with assortativity generally increasing with @xmath18 .",
    "the finding of positive correlation between the degree of a node and the degree of its neighbors is consistent with an analogous finding  @xcite with iranian data , using a different technique from ours  @xcite . for comparison",
    "we show the assortativity obtained by using time shuffled networks .",
    "since assortativity of the original networks is far higher than those of shuffled systems , the high assortativity can not be due to a finite size effect or to the spatial clustering displayed in the data , since time shuffling preserves location .",
    "we investigate the nature of the high - degree nodes and find that high degree is not a matter of more events being nearby , as there is a slight tendency for higher degree nodes to actually have _ longer _ distance links on average than low degree nodes .",
    "additionally , we found that node degree is essentially independent of both maximum earthquake size and number of events .    because fig .",
    "[ fig : synth ] shows , as mentioned above , that many links can be regarded as the result of noise , we investigate the stability of links over time ( fig .  [",
    "fig : likeness ] ) .",
    "similarity of the network between the first seven years ( 1985 - 1992 ) and the second seven years ( 1992 - 1998 ) in the catalog is found as follows .",
    "we find the set of links that satisfy @xmath40 in both the 1985 - 1992 network and the 1992 - 1998 network , and create a series out of the respective link strengths ( correlations ) in the 1985 - 1992 network .",
    "we create another series using the same links , now using the corresponding strengths from the 1992 - 1998 network .",
    "we then correlate the two series using the pearson correlation coefficient given by eq .",
    "( [ prsn ] ) .",
    "we find that the network is far more stable over time than counterpart results given by shuffling the time series ( fig .",
    "[ fig : likeness ] ) . because one would expect large correlations that arise purely from noise to have no `` memory '' from one time period to another , the finding of network stability over several years is consistent with our result that these links are not simply the result of chance .",
    "to summarize our results , we have introduced a novel method for analyzing earthquake activity through the use of networks  @xcite .",
    "the resulting networks ( i ) display links with no characteristic length scale , ( ii ) display far more links than expected from chance alone , ( iii ) are far more assortative , and ( iv ) display significantly more link stability over time .",
    "the lack of a characteristic length scale is consistent with previous work and underscores the difficulty in making accurate predictions .",
    "the statistically significant nature of all of these results is consistent with the possibility of the presence of hidden information in a catalog , not captured by existing models or previous earthquake network approaches .",
