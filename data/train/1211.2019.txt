    "the running charge plays a particularly distinguished role in qcd , both in the history of qcd and in extensive applications .",
    "its perturbative behavior in the uv exemplifies asymptotic freedom , and it is constantly invoked in phenomenology .",
    "but it has its difficulties : one must choose a single momentum scale for the running charge , while for many processes ( for example , octet @xmath6 annihilation into two gluon jets ) it may be more appropriate physically to use the parent three - point function with its three momentum scales .",
    "the pt @xcite offers a way to construct off - shell green s functions of a non - abelian gauge theory ( nagt ) that are gauge- and process - independent .",
    "recently , a trivial extension was introduced @xcite that made pt green s functions also renormalization - group independent ( rgi ) , meaning independent of any renormalization mass @xmath7 .",
    "this is possible because the pt leads to ghost - free ward identities , like those of qed , and through these to the equality of certain renormalization constants .",
    "first , we describe conventional renormalization in order to contrast it with the pt - rgi procedure . consider a renormalizable , or in @xmath8 with additional four - point couplings . ]",
    "field theory with a bare coupling term @xmath9 , yielding an unrenormalized vertex @xmath10 .",
    "use subscripts @xmath11 to denote fully - dressed but unrenormalized green s functions or fields , and @xmath12 to denote renormalized quantities .",
    "these are related by renormalization constants : @xmath13 in this generic theory the renormalized coupling is arbitrary , and there are four different renormalization constants .",
    "a typical renormalization equation applies to the propagators @xmath14 : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is a uv cutoff and @xmath7 is an essentially arbitrary mass scale  the renormalization point .",
    "( of course , one can introduce many renormalization points , but usually one is enough . )",
    "now @xmath17 is finite and independent of @xmath16 , but the price paid is that this propagator depends on @xmath7 .",
    "various choices of @xmath7 are related by the renormalization group .",
    "our objective is to modify the pt so that this @xmath7-dependence goes away at the level of off - shell green s functions , and not just at the level of the s - matrix .",
    "although we will not carry out any calculations in a ghost - free gauge such as @xmath18 , it simplifies understanding of the pt - rgi connection to imagine using such a gauge for conventional ( gauge - dependent ) feynman graphs .",
    "this can not affect any properties of the pt itself , which always deals with gauge - invariant quantities constructed from re - organizing the feynman graphs .",
    "we begin with pure gluonic green s functions ; it is a simple matter to add closed quarks loops , , where @xmath19 is , for example , the quark - gluon vertex and @xmath20 the quark propagator ; this product is rgi in the pt . ] which do not change any of our conclusions for green s functions with only gluon external legs .",
    "an essential feature of the pt is that even for an nagt the fundamental ward identities are qed - like . indeed ,",
    "for the nagt in a ghost - free gauge they are qed - like even before applying the pt re - organization .",
    "this means , as we show below , that there is only one renormalization constant in a ghost - free gauge for the pt : the propagator , three - vertex , and four - vertex renormalization constants are equal to a common value @xmath21 .",
    "let us denote the unrenormalized pt propagator by @xmath22 , the pt three - vertex by @xmath23 , and the pt four - vertex by @xmath24 ( suppressing group indices ; often we also suppress vector indices when there can be no confusion ) . for future reference , we introduce the proper self - energy of the pt propagator @xmath22 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the inverse free propagator in whatever gauge",
    "is chosen ; it carries all the gauge dependence .",
    "the self - energy is explicitly free of all gauge dependence .    we need not indicate whether the green s functions in the ward identities are unrenormalized or renormalized . in the pt @xmath27 is independent of the gauge chosen , and in a ghost - free gauge it can not depend on the vector @xmath28 that sets the gauge @xmath18",
    ". therefore it is of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a projector .",
    "[ in the light - cone gauge , the self - energy does depend on @xmath28 before applying the pt , and there is another conserved form that is eliminated by the pt ; see @xcite .",
    "] just as in qed the ward identity implies that @xmath31 , the present ward identities tell us that there is just one renormalization constant @xmath21 , such that : @xmath32    throughout this paper we work in a euclidean metric .",
    "all that is necessary to form pt - rgi green s functions is to divide the ( proper ) pt green s functions by @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting green s functions @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the same whether unrenormalized or renormalized and therefore independent of the renormalization point @xmath7 , as eqn .",
    "( [ renormdef ] ) shows : @xmath36    we sometimes write @xmath37 with @xmath38 an rgi function . in perturbation theory , @xmath39 , so we * define * @xmath40 at all momenta .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is rgi .",
    "finally , we have : @xmath42    from now on we drop the irrelevant subscripts @xmath43 on pt - rgi green s functions .",
    "these relations mean that , for example , @xmath44 is independent of @xmath7 as well as of @xmath16 .",
    "we show below that the ghost - free ward identities continue to be satisfied by the pt - rgi green s functions . and finally , the process of dividing by @xmath33 is unnecessary for all green s functions with five or more legs , since the skeleton graphs for these are finite .",
    "now we come to the essence of constructing pt - rgi green s functions .",
    "the pt ward identities are : @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 note that the ward identities are of the same form in terms of pt - rgi green s functions , for example : @xmath48    certain quantities require special treatment , notably seagull graphs .",
    "these are indeed formally pt - rgi as one can easily check , but still naively divergent , and there is no mass term in the lagrangian to absorb this divergence .",
    "but it has been argued @xcite that , due to an equation given in @xcite , there is a cancellation between the seagull and other graphs that removes this divergence .",
    "the sdes of nagts are complex in any formulation , and have additional features  both complexities and simplifications  in the pt . one key point for the pt",
    "is that it has ghost - free ward identities allowing precise construction of the two - point function ( propagator ) from the three - point vertex .",
    "( similarly , the three - vertex can be constructed from the four - vertex , but we will not mention the four - vertex further in this initial investigation . ) of course , the three - vertex depends on the propagator , so this sounds like a vicious circle .",
    "we suggest here some methods for breaking into this circle .    the skeleton - graph expansion equivalent to the sdes will be expressed in terms of fully - dressed vertices , and then the ward identity will produce a propagator sde with only fully - dressed vertices .",
    "this is the easiest way to see full bose symmetry , etc , and it also avoids difficult issues of multiplying things by infinite zs , instead of subtracting , as in eqn .",
    "( [ approxvert ] ) below .",
    "such an expansion with only dressed vertices and propagators differs in structure , but is equivalent to , the more conventional sde treatment with some vertices being bare .",
    "a key point of this paper is the suggestion that a good approximation to the fully - dressed one - loop sdes is to use free vertices and free massive propagators in the loop and then apply the pt as in @xcite .",
    "some minor  by hand \" adjustments to seagulls yields an output which satisfies all the requirements for a one - loop pt - rgi three - vertex and , through the ward identity , a one - loop pt - rgi gluon propagator , both of which are well - behaved in the ir .",
    "it turns out that the ward identities allow a precise characterization of the uv behavior of the full non - linear sdes ; to no one s surprise , this is exactly the same as in perturbation theory , because the gauge theory is asymptotically - free .",
    "write the vertex as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the born term .",
    "for the propagator , write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is one of the @xmath53 .",
    "if we save only the coefficient @xmath54 of the born term in the vertex , the ward identity has two terms , each of which says : @xmath55 clearly , this can not be an equation for all @xmath53 , but in the uv region @xmath56 with @xmath52 large , it is true to leading order of logarithms ; non - leading orders are compensated in the terms we omitted in the vertex . we do not have space here to show a crucial result , which is however elementary for @xmath5 : using a ghost - free gauge for the pt , all one - loop skeleton graphs for the vertex depend only on the product @xmath57 .",
    "but this in the uv is the same , according to eqn .",
    "( [ uvwi ] ) , as if all vertices and propagators are free .      what happens beyond the uv and into the ir , where eqn .",
    "( [ uvwi ] ) needs correction ?",
    "this is a hard problem , and we have only some suggestive remarks .",
    "these are based on extending the calculation in @xcite of the perturbative one - loop three - vertex ( see fig.[3gv ] ) to be phenomenologically useful in the ir .",
    "the pt graphs for the one - loop three - vertex are extracted from an s - matrix element for on - shell quarks through pinching out internal quark lines with ward identities , as explained in @xcite.,width=480 ]    we are interested in these graphs as skeleton graphs , so all vertices and lines are to be thought of as dressed .",
    "the simplest possible ir stabilization of an asymptotically - free theory is to change free massless propagators into massive ones in the pt calculation of the one - loop three - vertex of @xcite .",
    "this calculation is effectively in the background - field feynman gauge , so we use as the propagator @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "it is important for what follows that @xmath61 is constant in momentum space .",
    "the corresponding vertex is the free vertex in the background - field feynman gauge , which is not bose - symmetric on all three gluon lines , but obeys a simple ward identity on one of the lines .",
    "we always choose this special line to be one of the gluon lines attached to quark lines in fig .",
    "the ward identity is : @xmath62= \\delta^{-1}_{\\mu\\nu}(p_3)-\\delta^{-1}_{\\mu\\nu}(p_2).\\ ] ] and the crucial point is that if @xmath61 is constant in momentum space , the mass terms in the inverse propagators cancel in this ward identity . in consequence , since the pt is based on repeatedly applying such ward identities , one can choose all numerators in the graphs of fig .",
    "[ 3gv ] to be the same as in the massless case .",
    "we are not trying to calculate @xmath61 self - consistently , which would involve a careful treatment of seagulls , so we take the liberty of defining seagull terms , with numerators @xmath63 , as necessary for satisfying ward identities . furthermore , for the same reason , at the end of the calculation we must add a term as prescribed in @xcite to account for the massless poles in the propagator side of the ward identity . this term can not contribute to s - matrix elements , since it annihilates conserved currents , and is of the form : @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this addition corrects the vertex side of the ward identity to have the massless poles of the inverse propagators on the right - hand side .",
    "of course , none of these tweaks affect the uv properties .",
    "this one - loop approach is guaranteed to be self - consistent in the uv , for reasons already given .",
    "but it gives useful results in the ir too .",
    "in fact , it reproduces an earlier suggestion @xcite for the for the pt - rgi propagator : @xmath65 & + & p_{\\mu\\nu}(p^2)m^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is chosen so that @xmath44 has a pole at @xmath67 .",

    "if the mass does not run , possibly corresponding to a bare mass term , this condensate could be interpreted as an @xmath117 condensate , but this is not what we have in mind . in conventional qcd",
    "the one - loop operator - product expansion of the pt propagator gives @xcite a mass running in the uv as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a positive constant , given in @xcite .",

    "we conjecture that in pt - rgi ordering all uv divergences are captured in the one- and two - loop skeleton graphs only , all others being uv - finite .",
    "this may remind one of t hooft s remark @xcite that only the first two coefficients of the perturbative beta - function are scheme - independent , and that it is actually possible to choose a scheme where all other coefficients vanish .",
    "we emphasize that this does not mean that the running charge , or other quantities normally extracted from the beta function , is given exactly by saving only two coefficients in the beta function .",
    "in fact , in the pt - rgi scheme the beta function is at best a derived quantity that can be read off from the running charge as calculated ( uniquely ) from the sdes of this scheme .",
    "all - order effects are still critical , and contain , for example , the contribution of solitons and condensates @xcite .",

    "these principles apply to all orders in @xmath5 .",
    "the main point is that the number of loops in any skeleton graph for the 3-vertex is in direct correspondence with the leading uv behavior of the exact vertex , in such a way that the leading uv behavior of the vertex is exactly given by the one - loop skeleton graph .",
    "the skeleton - graph expansion for nagts is complicated ; further details for nagts , many but not all of which hold for the pt , are given in @xcite . as pointed out there , the skeleton expansion we and they use is free of overlapping divergences , and can be subtractively renormalized .",
