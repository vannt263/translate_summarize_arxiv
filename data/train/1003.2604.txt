    "over the last years the strong interaction of charmed hadrons among themselves and with other species of hadrons has received increasing attention . from the discovery of charmed mesons in the seventies until the late eighties there was no motivation to study in detail the interactions of these particles . in the early nineties there was a series of papers trying to compute the cross section of a @xmath5 with ordinary light hadrons .",
    "the motivation came from the heavy ion program running at cern and later at rhic . at that time",
    "@xmath5 suppression was considered as a signature of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation and it was very important to know as accurately as possible the purely hadronic ( non - qgp induced ) charmonium suppression , which would be the background for the qgp signal . from 2000 on , it became slowly clear that the physics of @xmath5 is much more complex than thought before and its simple suppression was no longer considered as a qgp signal and the subject lost interest . on the other hand , during those years , at the @xmath6 factories the collaborations babar and belle started to produce results .",
    "one of the important decay channels of the @xmath6 mesons is into @xmath5 ( plus other things ) .",
    "moreover these collaborations found new charmonium states ( the @xmath7 , the @xmath8 s and the @xmath9 ) , which also decay into @xmath5 or into @xmath10 .",
    "it has been conjectured that both @xmath6 and the new charmonium states very often decay into an intermediate two body state with @xmath11 s and/or @xmath12 s , which then undergoes final state interactions , with the exchange of one or more virtual mesons . in order to calculate the amplitudes of these processes we need to know the relevant vertices involving the charmed mesons . as an example of specific situation where a precise knowledge of the @xmath13 form factor is required , we may consider the decay @xmath14 .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , this decay proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the @xmath7 decays into a @xmath11 - @xmath12 intermediate state and then these two particles exchange a @xmath12 producing the final @xmath5 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1b and 1f of @xcite . in order to compute the effect of these interactions in the final decay rate",
    "we need the @xmath16 form factor . more generally , we need to know all the charm form factors to correclty calculate the interaction of @xmath5 with light hadrons and the final state interactions in @xmath6 decays .",
    "these form factors have been calculated in the framework of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite techniques in a series of works on vertices involving charmed mesons , namely @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18@xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the @xmath27 form factor with qcdsr . in the next section , for completeness",
    "we describe the qcdsr technique and in section iii we present the results and compare them with results obtained in other works .",
    "following our previous works and especially ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the three - point function associated with the @xmath0 vertex , which is given by @xmath29 for an off - shell @xmath11 meson , and : @xmath30 for an off - shell @xmath31 meson . the general expression for the vertices ( [ corredoff ] ) and ( [ correrhooff ] ) has only one lorentz structure .",
    "equations  ( [ corredoff ] ) and ( [ correrhooff ] ) can be calculated in two diferent ways : using quark degrees of freedom the theoretical or qcd side or using hadronic degrees of freedom the phenomenological side . in the qcd side",
    "the correlators are evaluated using the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the ope incorporates the effects of the qcd vacuum through an infinite series of condensates of increasing dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the representation in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom is responsible for the introduction of the form factors , decay constants and masses .",
    "both representations are matched invoking the quark - hadron global duality .",

    "the corresponding three - point functions , eqs .",
    "( [ corredoff ] ) and ( [ correrhooff ] ) , are written in terms of hadron masses , decay constants and form factors .",
    "this is the so called phenomenological side of the sum rule and it is based on the interactions at the hadronic level , which are described here by the following effective lagrangian @xcite _ d^*d = - g_d^*d ^ ( d _ _ _ |d^ * _ + hc ) [ lagran ] from where one can extract the matrix element associated with the @xmath0 vertex . in the above expression we have @xmath32 . saturating eqs .",

    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the meson decay constants appearing in the equations above are defined by the vacuum to meson transition amplitudes : 0|j^d|d = m_d^2f_dm_c , [ fd ] and v(p,)|j^_|0=m_vf_v^ * _ , [ fv ] for the vector mesons @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the form factor which we want to estimate",
