    "the spectrum of the lower - most slit on the east master frame was discarded due to contamination via scattered light from the mxu on fors2 . a thorough visual inspection of the spectra of the remaining 93 stars revealed two carbon stars in our sample ( one from each the south and east field ) .",
    "despite the strong cn and c@xmath50 molecular bands the cat is still present so velocities were still obtained for these stars ( see table [ tab : bigtableofstardata ] ) .",
    "the relation between the cat and the continuum however , is affected to the point that determination of the equivalent widths of these spectral lines would no longer be useful .",
    "thus , no metallicity analysis was performed on these stars .",
    "the equivalent width measurements were performed using a modified version of interactive software written and kindly provided by @xcite to a. cole ; this program was modified to fit the spectral lines using the sum of a lorentzian and a gaussian profile @xcite , measured relative to a linear fit to the continuum bandpasses .",
    "the bandpasses are those defined by @xcite .",
    "the median fractional uncertainty for these measurements were : @xmath54 , 0.044 , and 0.079 - ordered from the strongest to weakest of the cat lines .",
    "the benefit of using the sum of a lorentzian and a gaussian function is outlined in @xcite , but arguably is only really of importance for spectra with a higher s / n than our own .",
    "we experimented with different continuum - fitting approaches and with direct numerical integration vs.  profile - fitting and found that no reasonable change produced a large change in the measured equivalent width , amounting to a total plausible systematic error of @xmath270.09   .",
    "the same program was used to measure neutral sodium and magnesium lines in the nearby spectrum during the identification of foreground contaminants ( see below ) .",
    "since the cat was first identified as a good metallicity indicator @xcite several studies have sought to explore its robustness over wide ranges of stellar ages and metallicities ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the empirical calibrations derived in @xcite , calibrations that used the same fors2 instrumentation as this study and very similar data reduction techniques .",
    "whilst all calibrations utilize the summed equivalent widths of the cat in either a weighted ( e.g. , @xcite ) or unweighted fashion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , some authors choose to omit the weakest of the calcium triplet members ( @xmath55 8498  ) due to the potential reduction to s / n ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) whilst other authors - in particular those with high s / n - use all three lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we accept the the additional noise and use an unweighted sum of the equivalent width of all three lines for each of our 91 rgb stars : @xmath56 the reduced equivalent width or ` calcium index ' , @xmath57 is then constructed in the manner outlined in @xcite : @xmath58 this particular equivalent width measure exploits the empirically determined linear relation between an rgb stars @xmath7 magnitude and its measured @xmath59 for a given stellar population ( see e.g. , figure 3 , @xcite ) .",
    "scaling the summed equivalent width by the magnitude of the target star adequately removes any temperature or gravity dependence of the ca ii line widths by assuming that the function describing this dependence is linear over the small magnitude range @xmath60 .",
    "it is this strong dependence of the calcium triplet line widths on surface gravity and effective temperature that prevents us from quantitatively analysing the metallicities of the mw foreground dwarfs identified in this sample , as the correction introduced in equation ( [ eq : wprime ] ) is not valid for stars outside of the rgb .",
    "the use of the @xmath60 term in equation ( [ eq : wprime ] ) rather than an absolute magnitude @xmath61 , serves as a correction for the distance and reddening to the target population ; because distances are typically uncertain around the @xmath2510% level , a relative measure is frequently preferable .",
    "however , differential reddening across the target field can result in variations such that use of a single @xmath60 value for a whole galaxy can introduce biases to the derived metallicities .",
    "most authors take @xmath62 to be an average reddening corrected value across the entire galaxy or cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , whilst this is perfectly valid in almost all cases , ngc  6822 has a relatively high and patchy reddening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we explored a unique method of determining individually reddening - corrected synthetic @xmath62 magnitudes for each of our stars using the variation in the tip of the red giant branch magnitude around our targets to determine the appropriate synthetic @xmath62  to use in equation  [ eq : wprime ] ( see  [ sec : redd ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is ideally independent of metallicity over a wide metallicity range so as to justify the linearity of equation ( [ eq : wprime ] ) . here",
    "we will use @xmath64 from @xcite as this was uniquely derived to correspond to the same lorentzian  gaussian fit to the spectral lines as was utilized in this paper .",
    "differential reddening in front of and within ngc  6822 causes @xmath62  to vary from region to region , which may cause stars with identical atmospheric parameters to appear to vary in metallicity depending on their location in the galaxy .",
    "wholly accounting for the reddening of ngc  6822 along each line of sight is a non - trivial exercise .",
    "both the internal reddening due to the ism of ngc  6822 and the extinction along our line of sight in the mw combine to give reddening values higher than encountered in spectroscopic studies of similar galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis @xcite dust maps give a foreground extinction of @xmath65 based on dust column density surveys ; however , the reddening map derived by battinelli , demers & kunkel ( 2006 ) from these data show some hint of the ngc  6822 hi structure , indicating that at least some of the spatially variable dust emission originates in ngc  6822 , where the conversion from far - infrared surface brightness to visual extinction may differ from that in the milky way .",
    "a recent hst study of the stellar populations by @xcite gives a central @xmath66 , and an exterior @xmath67 - these correspond roughly to our south and east fields , respectively .",
    "the significant variation between these two regions can be briefly explored by considering the non - uniformity of the h i gas within ngc  6822 ( figure [ fig : ccdregs ] ) .",
    "compared to the south field , the reddening due to internal h i gas in the east region could be acceptably treated as spatially constant for the purpose of this study . however , because the h i column density varies from roughly 431 @xmath1710@xmath68 @xmath69 in the south region @xcite , and reddening scales roughly linearly with h i column density , we can not make the same assumption without compromising our determination of this region s metallicity .",
    "we therefore use an individual determination of the line of sight reddening to each of our 93 stars in order to reduce the systematic errors in final metallicity estimates ; we rely on the relative reddening with respect to a known reference point .",
    "it is possible to determine the relative extinction between two regions by measuring the shift in magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) with respect to a reference region if the stellar populations are not too dissimilar .",
    "this has two advantages compared to attempting to directly use the variation in @xmath70 : the horizontal branch magnitude is itself a function of both metallicity and age , which may vary between fields independently of dust extinction ( and which variation we do _ not _ wish to remove from the data ) ; and calibrated , homogeneous photometry down to the level of the horizontal branch is not readily available for the entirety of both our fields .",
    "by contrast , the i - band absolute magnitude of the trgb is a robust quantity that is almost insensitive to age over many gigayears , only mildly metallicity dependent , and precisely measurable across the full extent of ngc  6822 .",
    "this will be our standard candle for determining the dereddening correction needed to synthesize a uniform v@xmath71 for use in equation  [ eq : wprime ] .",
    "target positions from our fors2 preimaging were cross - listed with 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) @xmath72- , @xmath73- , and @xmath74-band photometry ( @xcite ) to obtain magnitudes for our targets in these bandpasses .",
    "the photometric @xmath72 and @xmath74 magnitudes were converted to @xmath75-band using transformations described in @xcite .",
    "individual subregions were then constructed for each of our targets by selecting all objects in the @xcite catalogue that fell within a 20@xmath39 region and had colours @xmath76 and @xmath77 to confine the photometry to the rgb .",
    "these subregions typically contain 9500 - 12500 objects for the east field targets and 14000 - 17000 for the south field target regions .    rather than manually determining the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) location from cmds , a one dimensional sobel edge - detection filter ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "was applied to @xmath74-band magnitude distribution functions generated for each subregion .",
    "since the trgb location is the @xmath74-band magnitude of the maximum sobel filter response , the final trgb was taken as the average of this maximum from three sobel edge - detections with slightly varied bandwidths ( variation in trgb location < @xmath140.02 mag ) ; the random error was adopted as the standard deviation from the mean of the three measurements ( see table [ tab : errors ] ) .",
    "we desire the reference hb magnitude to correspond to a very well - measured , and , ideally , little - reddened region of ngc  6822 .",
    "conveniently , grid 5 of the hst photometry of @xcite is centred on the giant hi hole ( see figure 1 in their paper ) , which also overlaps our east field . transforming their f814w magnitudes ( in the acs photometric system ) to standard cousins i , the hb location of cannon s grid 5",
    "is found to be @xmath78 .",
    "the final step is to convert this to a synthetic v@xmath79 using a colour - estimate for the horizontal branch .",
    "high quality data for 47 tucanae ( which has a similar metallicity to ngc  6822 ; @xcite ) and theoretical stellar isochrones consistently suggest that the intrinsic average colour of the hb is v@xmath35i @xmath250.80 .",
    "each of these steps carries some associated uncertainty ; combined with the intrinsic spread in colour and magnitude of the cmd features there is a likely total systematic error in the absolute v magnitude of the hb on the order of @xmath250.2  mag .",
    "the metallicity results are ultimately relatively insensitive to the exact value of v@xmath71 .",
    "what we hope to have removed by this procedure is any small but systematic error that could lead to the spurious appearance or obscuration of a metallicity gradient in the final dataset .",
    "we comment on the possibility of the unintended introduction of a net shift in metallicity in the discussion below .",
    "the line of sight reddening values thus derived range from @xmath80  @xmath81 , with mean values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the east and south fields , respectively .",
    "this serves to re - emphasis the spatially variable nature of the dust reddening within and in front of ngc  6822 .",
