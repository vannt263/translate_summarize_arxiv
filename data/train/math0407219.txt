    "sobolev type inequalities play an essential role in the study of the concentration phenomenon for probability measures .",
    "they are also a powerful tool to analyze the regularizing effects and the convergence to equilibrium of their associated symmetric semigroups .",
    "in particular , several surveys deal with the celebrated poincar ( or spectral gap ) inequality and the stronger logarithmic - sobolev inequality and provide striking applications @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a concrete illustration can be given for the family of probability measures on the real line @xmath3 these measures and their products @xmath4 deserved particular attention in recent years , where the focus was on dimension free properties .",
    "they enter talagrand s work on the concentration phenomenon for product measures .",
    "his study was continued by ledoux @xcite , who strongly put forward the use of the logarithmic sobolev inequality for concentration , and more recently by bobkov and houdr @xcite who introduced @xmath5-sobolev type inequalities in order to study the more delicate isoperimetric problem .",
    "we review the main results concerning these measures and the associated semigroup @xmath6 generated by the operator @xmath7 such that @xmath8    for @xmath9 the measures @xmath10 verify a weak spectral gap property introduced by aida and kusuoka as shown in @xcite .",
    "they satisfy the spectral gap inequality exactly when @xmath11 , and the logarithmic sobolev inequality if and only if @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 there is no dimension free concentration property @xcite .",
    "oppositely , the measures enjoy very strong properties when @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding semigroup is ultracontractive @xcite , meaning that for positive time it is continuous from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the measures satisfy a dimension free gaussian isoperimetric inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  9 ) , and this is as bad as it gets by the central limit theorem .",
    "recently , bobkov and zegarlinski @xcite obtained concentration inequalities for these measures but for the @xmath17-distance on @xmath18 .",
    "their results are based on appropriate modification of the logarithmic sobolev inequality , and show different behaviors for different values of @xmath19 .",
    "this was not the case when considering the euclidean distance .",
    "the range @xmath20 $ ] presents very interesting properties .",
    "we start with the gaussian case , @xmath21 , which is best understood .",
    "concentration of measure and isoperimetry in gauss space are now classical ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that they are both dimension free .",
    "recall that the isoperimetric inequality asserts in particular that for @xmath22 with @xmath23)$ ] one has for all @xmath24 , @xmath25\\big).\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is the @xmath27-dimensional euclidean ball .",
    "taking limits one obtains that among sets of given gaussian measure , half - spaces have minimal gaussian boundary measure .",
    "on the other hand , the gaussian measure has remarkable analytic properties : the corresponding ornstein - uhlenbeck semigroup is hypercontractive , as discovered by nelson @xcite .",
    "gross proved that this fact is equivalent to the logarithmic sobolev inequality @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the gaussian measure is the prototype of strictly log - concave measures .",
    "it was a success of the bakry - emery formalism to allow the extension of most of the previous results to abstract semigroups with positive curvature ( see @xcite for logarithmic sobolev inequalities and @xcite for gaussian isoperimetry and an abstract version of the levy - gromov theorem ) .",
    "the two sided exponential measure @xmath28 is also well understood .",
    "paper @xcite provides the following very precise estimate : if @xmath22 verifies @xmath29)$ ] then for all @xmath30 it holds @xmath31),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a universal constant and @xmath33 .",
    "see also @xcite . in a slightly weaker form ,",
    "such a statement was recovered by bobkov and ledoux @xcite , via a modified logarithmic sobolev inequality which is equivalent to poincar inequality .",
    "thus products of measures on @xmath34 with a spectral gap satisfy a concentration inequality on the exponential model .",
    "moreover , bobkov and houdr @xcite proved that @xmath35 satisfies a dimension free isoperimetric inequality of cheeger .",
    "the proof relies on an @xmath5 version of the poincar inequality , and the statement can be rephrased as follows : let @xmath22 with @xmath29)$ ] then for all @xmath30 @xmath36\\big).\\ ] ] this result completes the one of talagrand .",
    "it is weaker for large values of @xmath37 but gives isoperimetric information as @xmath37 goes to zero .    understanding the case @xmath38 is the task of the present paper .",
    "the concentration phenomenon is already well described .",
    "indeed , talagrand s exponential inequality transfers to @xmath39 for any @xmath40 @xcite and ensures that for every @xmath22 and @xmath24 @xmath41 in particular if @xmath2 and @xmath42 one gets that for @xmath43 , @xmath44 . a functional approach to this fact was recently discovered by lataa and oleszkiewicz @xcite .",
    "these authors established the following family of sobolev inequalities : there exists a universal constant @xmath45 such that for all @xmath46 it holds @xmath47 for smooth enough @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 these inequalities are due to beckner @xcite .",
    "inequalities   interpolate between poincar and log - sobolev .",
    "they enjoy the tensorisation property and imply dimension free concentration with decay @xmath50 as expected .",
    "obviously @xcite was the starting point of an extension of the log - sobolev approach to concentration , encompassing more general behaviors .",
    "recently two of us simplified the proof of and characterized all measures on @xmath51 satisfying the same property @xcite ( such a criterion for log - sobolev already existed , thanks to bobkov and gtze @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for other developements .",
    "inequalities above are part of a more general family denoted @xmath52-sobolev inequalities .",
    "a study of this family in connection with some aspects of semi - group theory is done in @xcite .",
    "the initial goal of this work is to obtain a precise dimension free isoperimetric inequality for @xmath53 when @xmath2 . namely we want to prove that there exists a constant @xmath45 such that for all @xmath54 @xmath55 for all @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the surface measure of @xmath56 ( see section [ sec : isoperimetrie ] ) .",
    "this bound is known for @xmath59 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite and can be deduced from @xcite in dimension 1 .",
    "so is exactly what is expected .",
    "this result is stronger than the concentration result .",
    "indeed it implies that for all @xmath27 and @xmath22 with @xmath60)$ ] one has @xmath61\\big).\\ ] ] this interpolates between and .",
    "inequality will be shown in theorem [ th : iso ] as the achievement of a somewhat intricate story . actually , we prove much more and develop several useful methods on the way .",
    "they should find a field of applications in the study of empirical processes or in statistical physics .    before describing the organisation of the paper ,",
    "let us explain that our proof relies on a method initiated by ledoux @xcite and improved in @xcite .",
    "it can be summarized as follows : any integrability improving property of a semigroup with curvature bounded from below provides isoperimetric information for the invariant measure .",
    "hence our problem translates to a question on the semigroup @xmath6 for @xmath2 .",
    "however , a theorem of hegh - krohn and simon @xcite shows that @xmath62 is never continuous from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "since the @xmath65 scale is too rough for our problem , we analyze the regularizing properties in appropriate scales of orlicz spaces and ask wether the semigroup maps @xmath66 into a smaller orlicz space .",
    "section [ ii ] contains the required elements on orlicz spaces .",
    "section [ iii ] presents a sufficient condition on the young function @xmath67 for @xmath68 ( a slightly modified @xmath62 ) to map continuously @xmath69 into @xmath70 , for a fixed @xmath71 .",
    "this condition relies on the probabilistic representation of @xmath62 ( girsanov transformation ) and on martingale methods inspired by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the method can not reach the contraction property ( only boundedness , simply called @xmath67-orlicz hyperboundedness ) and does not easily yield explicit bounds .",
    "the criterion readily extends to certain perturbations of an ultracontractive semi - group .    in order to get contraction results and explicit bounds , we build in section  [ iv ] the full analogue of gross theory .",
    "following @xcite we start with the analogue of a result by hegh - krohn and simon ( theorem [ 4.3 ] ) : if @xmath72 is continuous from @xmath73 into @xmath74 then @xmath75 satisfies a defective logarithmic orlicz - sobolev inequality ( dlosi ) .",
    "this is actually a particular @xmath0-sobolev inequality as studied in @xcite ( the notion apparently goes back to concordet ) . for the @xmath76 boltzmann measure @xmath10",
    ", it is equivalent ( see ) to the following result of rosen @xcite : there exist @xmath56 and @xmath77 such that for @xmath78 , @xmath79 see adams @xcite for extensions and zegarlinski @xcite for an application of rosen type inequalities to the study for gibbs measures with non - gaussian tails .",
    "next we consider homogeneous @xmath0-sobolev inequalities .",
    "one of our main results is theorem  [ th : go ] where we obtain the equivalence between a @xmath0-sobolev inequality and the @xmath80 orlicz - hyperboundedness ( or hypercontractivity ) of the whole semigroup for @xmath81 . under a few assumptions of @xmath0 , the time evolution of the regularizing effect",
    "is quantified .",
    "a weak form of part of these results appeared in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 and theorem 2.4 ) .",
    "these authors proved that a particular tight @xmath0-sobolev inequality is equivalent to orlicz - hyperboundedness for some time .",
    "their motivation was a criterion for the generator to have a non - empty essential spectrum ( see @xcite for connections with super - poincar inequalities ) . by theorem",
    "[ th : go ] , a tight @xmath0-sobolev inequality for a nonnegative @xmath0 garantees that the semigroup is orlicz - hypercontractive .",
    "we conclude this section by extending the well known inequality of rothaus @xcite : under spectral gap assumption this allows to turn certain defective @xmath0-sobolev inequalities into tight ones .",
    "section  [ sec : fsobolev ] provides a thorough study of sobolev type inequalities . in the gaussian context",
    "the log - sobolev inequality is canonical and has plenty of remarkable properties : it tensorizes , provides concentration via herbst argument , hypercontractivity and entropy decay along the semigroup . in our more general setting , in particular for @xmath39 , @xmath38 , no such miracle happens .",
    "several sobolev inequalities are available .",
    "however none of them concentrates all good properties .",
    "this is why we undertake a precise study of beckner type inequalities , of homogeneous @xmath0-sobolev inequalities and additive @xmath82-sobolev inequalities also called @xmath52-entropy inequalities ( wee shall not discuss the latter in terms of exponential decay of @xmath52-entropy .",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "our strategy is to provide each inequality with a simpler reduced form relating the measure of sets to their @xmath75-capacity .",
    "this notion was alluded to by the first and last - named authors in @xcite .",
    "here we use it systematically in the spirit of mazja @xcite .",
    "note that the probabilistic setting is delicate since constant functions are equality cases in all our inequalities .",
    "our approach is an extension to any dimension of the criteria on the real line recently obtained through hardy inequalities @xcite .",
    "it provides new criteria and equivalences between several sobolev inequalities .",
    "a final figure summarizes the situation .",
    "section [ concentration ] deals with the consequences of generalized beckner inequalities for the concentration of measure .",
    "they are immediate from the method of lataa - oleszkiewicz , and where discussed independently by wang @xcite .",
    "our contribution here comes from our sharp criteria for these inequalities .",
    "in particular we give general neat conditions for products of measures on @xmath51 to enjoy dimension free concentration with rate @xmath83 where @xmath84 is convex , but less than @xmath85 . under reasonable assumptions the criterion is satisfied by the measure @xmath86 itself , so the concentration is sharp . for other results in connection with mass transportation ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "section  [ examples ] illustrates all the previous results in the case of @xmath76 boltzmann measures . in this concrete situation",
    "we explain how to deal with the technical conditions involved .",
    "we also develop a perturbation argument similar to the one of @xcite .",
    "the final section deduces isoperimetric inequalities from semigroup hyperboundedness properties . the claimed infinite dimensional isoperimetric bound is derived . as a consequence a family of comparison theorems",
    "is provided .",
    "for sake of clarity we decided not to develop our argument in its full generality .",
    "however , most of our results easily extend to more general situations , encompassing diffusion operators on riemannian manifolds .",
    "this is the case of the gross - orlicz theory , of the reductions to inequalities between capacity and measure .",
    "the final isoperimetric lower bounds would work when the curvatures of the generators is bounded from below .",
    "in this section we shall discuss a weakened form of _ hypercontractivity _ and _ hyperboundedness _ , replacing @xmath87 spaces by _ orlicz spaces_. before to state the natural definition we have in mind , and because orlicz spaces are somewhat intricate to use , we shall first introduce in this section the material we need .",

    "we also assume that the pair @xmath104 is normalized , _",

    "we shall use two norms on each space , @xmath109 with similar definitions for @xmath89 .",
    "the first one is called the _ gauge _ ( or luxemburg ) _ norm _ while the second definition does not coincide with the usual orlicz norm ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 page 58 ) ) .    indeed in order to compare orlicz norms and usual @xmath110 norms in the framework of markov semi - groups ( for a given probability measure @xmath75 ) , we need the norms of constant functions to be equal to the same constant . with our definitions , and thanks to the regularity properties of @xmath67 and @xmath89 it is known that for @xmath111 and @xmath112 it holds ( see ( * ? ? ? * proposition 1 p.58 ) ) @xmath113 accordingly @xmath114 similar results being true for @xmath108 .",

    "the result was known for @xmath1416 .",
    "this fact is proved by integrating the inequality @xmath1419 which provides a similar information about boundary measure ( this corresponds to infinitesimal enlargements ) . this isoperimetric inequality is a consequence of the fact that @xmath1420 is comparable to @xmath1421 .",
    "the comparison theorem of @xcite implies that @xmath1422 is larger than a universal constant times @xmath1423 .",
