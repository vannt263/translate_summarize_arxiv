    "qcd , the theory of strong interactions has some peculiar built - in features which should be tested .",
    "for example if particles are densely packed , they are believed to be free in the theory due to the property af . again",
    "the most important building blocks of the theory , namely ( u , d , s ) quarks , are believed to be nearly massless but acquires a substantial mass when the density is low .",
    "the masses are supposed to become small when the density is high ( csr ) .",
    "the third surprise in qcd is that quarks are completely confined in a hadron and one can only question whether in a large system like a compact star there may be partial deconfinement in the sense that quarks are not bound as in a hadron .",
    "the study of ss from theory and observations is thus a very interesting challenge - itoh thought of quarks with parastatistics as constituents of stars as early as 1970 , even before qcd .",
    "then witten ( 1984 ) discussed the existence of strange quark matter ( sqm ) and strange stars ( ss ) as a result of cosmic separation of phases .",
    "the possible existence of sqm , with af and csr , is studied in astrophysics as there are ( a ) some evidence of compact objects that fit in with ss ( dey et al .",
    "1998 , li et al .",

    "many superbursts are now seen .",
    "they are like normal type i thermonuclear bursts and seen from some compact stars which accrete from their binary partners - but last for hours instead of seconds and are highly energetic .",
    "one may need to invoke ss to explain them ( sinha et al .",
    "2002 , sinha et al .",
    "2005 , page & cumming 2005 ) . a limiting value of the magnetic field can be assigned to strange stars of @xmath6 explaining he shortage of radio pulsars with fields less than this value ( mandal et al .",

    "the situation is worse in heavy ion reactions for testing the features of qcd .",

    "2003 ) indicate a phase transition from ordinary matter . but this phase is not the quark gluon plasma with af and csr that the protagonists searched for :     however , there are a number of features , early on considered as defining the concept of the qgp , that do not appear to be realized in the current reactions , or at least have not ( yet ? ) been identified in experiment .",
    "these are associated with the expectations that a qgp would be characterized by a vanishing interaction between quarks and exhibit the features of chiral symmetry restoration and , furthermore , that the system would exhibit a clear phase transition behaviour . \"",
    "( brahms , arsene @xmath7 2004 )    the strange star hypothesis may thus be a better laboratory to test the properties of qcd .",
    "t hooft ( 1974 ) suggested the use of inverse of the number of _ colours _ @xmath8 as an expansion parameter since there are no free parameters in qcd .",
    "a baryonic system like stars can be explored in relativistic tree level calculation with a potential which may be obtained from the meson sector phenomenology in ( witten 1979 ) using @xmath8 theory .",
    "we have done this with richardson potential - modified to have different scales for af and confinement - deconfinement mechanism ( cdm ) with parameters are fitted from baryon magnetic moments ( bagchi @xmath9 2005 ) .",
    "so there are no free potential parameters left in ss calculations . in this model , a density dependent mass is chosen and from the two body potential a mean field eos is derived for beta stable chargeless ( u - d - s ) matter .",
    "the beta stability and charge neutrality demands a self consistent calculation of the chemical potentials of the quarks and electrons since interquark interaction is present and also involves contribution from density dependence of quark mass and gluon screening length .",
    "our interaction potential is due to richardson ( 1979 ) and is given by , v_ij = 12 271ln(1 + * q*^2 /^2)1*q*^2 [ eq : v ] @xmath10 being the momentum transfer between i@xmath11 and j@xmath11 quarks .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath12 is @xmath13 for hadron phenomenology ( crater & van alstine 1984 , dey @xmath14 1986 ) .",
    "but in ss calculation @xmath12 is taken @xmath15 ( dey @xmath14 1998 ) .",
    "this discrepancy ultimately leads us to modify the potential and the modified form of the potential is , @xmath16 \\label{eq : vtl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath17 is the scale parameter representing the af as the first two terms are asymptotically zero for large @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the scale parameter corresponding to confinement as the third term reduces to a linear confinement for small @xmath18 .",
    "from bagchi @xmath20 , ( 2004 ) , we get @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the modified potential is used in ss calculation ( bagchi @xmath14 , 2005b ) .",
    "the potential is screened due to gluon propagation in a medium and @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "inverse screening length @xmath25 ( @xmath26 gluon mass @xmath27 ) is : @xmath28 fermi momenta are related to number density : @xmath29 @xmath30 the subscript @xmath31 stands for the electron .",
    "perturbative quark gluon coupling , @xmath32 is @xmath33 in the unmodified potential and 0.55 - 0.65 for the modified potential . the quark mass , @xmath34 is taken to be density dependent to restore chiral symmetry at high density : m_i = m_i + m_q  sech ( n_bn n _ 0 ) ,   i = u , d , s. [ eq : qm ] where the constituent quark mass @xmath35 lies between 300 - 350 @xmath36 for each quark , @xmath37 is the baryon number density , @xmath38 is the normal nuclear matter density and @xmath39 is a parameter .",
    "the current quark masses , @xmath40 are taken as 4 , 7 and 150 @xmath36 for u , d , s quarks respectively . from the charge neutrality and beta equilibrium conditions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( chemical potentials ) of quarks and electron",
    "are obtained as a function of @xmath43 and performing a relativistic hartree - fock calculation , the energy density @xmath44 of the sqm is obtained .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics gives the eos of sqm at zero temperature as : p = _ i(_in_i-_i ) + ( _ en_e-_e ) [ eq : eos ] to obtain a realistic eos , the model parameters @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath39 are chosen in such a way that the minimum value of energy per baryon ( @xmath45 ) for uds quark matter is less than that of the most stable element @xmath46 @xmath26 930 @xmath36 .",
    "thus uds quark matter can construct stable stars .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath47 is obtained at the star surface where the pressure is zero .",
    "the presence of zero pressure indicates the existence of a sharp surface of the strange star in contrast to fuzzy surfaces of the neutron stars .",
    "the surface is sharp since strong interaction dictates the deconfinement point .    on the contrary , for the same parameters , the minimum value of @xmath47 for ud quark matter is greater than that of @xmath46 so that @xmath46 remains the most stable element in the non - strange world . using this eos for strange quark matter we obtain the mass - radius relation of the strange star by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( tov equation ) with appropriate boundary conditions .    among different",
    "eoss obtained from our ss model , varying the parameters , only one ( eos a ) is used in the present work and the parameters for this eos are listed in table [ tab : allmrnew ] .",

    "( 2003 ) as evidence of surface vibration from strange stars .",
    "now , the residuals for 1e1207@xmath25209 , as supplied by s. mereghetti , is plotted in fig.([fig : mere ] ) and are fitted with an empirical form for harmonic oscillations with an arbitrary envelope of the form @xmath48\\ ] ] where @xmath49s are the amplitudes and @xmath50s are the central frequencies with widths @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath52 are given in the table [ tab : coef ] .",
    "it is clear that the fundamental and even harmonics are suppressed while the odd harmonics are dominant .",
    "this may be due to the preferential detection efficiency of the signal receiver , in which case the observed form will change when a different satellite is used . on the other hand",
    "if it is due to preferential absorption in the interstellar medium , the form could change even with the same detector .    to us",
    "the second alternative seems preferred at the moment , since at different times with change of phase , shown in different colours in bignami et al .",
    "the intensity in these phases vary .",
    "but a clear understanding of the physical phenomena behind it is yet needed .",
    "another check for the existence of ss is the mass - radius ( @xmath0 ) ratio which can be inferred if the gravitational redshift is measured for some spectral lines .",
    "the gravitational redshift is given by :    @xmath53    from the spectral analysis of x - ray bursts from exo 0748@xmath2676 cottam , paerels and mendez ( 2002 ) found a redshift of @xmath54 .",
    "later , tiengo @xmath14 ( 2005 ) performed a spectral analysis of an xmm - newton observation of the x - ray binary 4u 1700 + 24 during an outburst in august 2002 . at low energies they detected a prominent soft excess , which they modeled with a broad gaussian centered at @xmath55 0.5 kev . in the high resolution rgs spectrum they detected an emission line , centered at @xmath56@xmath57 .",
    "the authors gave two possible interpretations for this line : o viii at redshift @xmath58 or ne ix at redshift z @xmath55 0.4 .",
    "but the authors argued o viii to be a better candidate than ne for the observed emission line . on the contrary , while modeling the spectrum of three lmxbs 4u 0614@xmath59091 , 2s 0918@xmath2549 , and 4u 1543@xmath2624 juett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed that there is excess neon local to each of these sources as in the 4u 1626@xmath267 .",
    "so there is no reason to exclude the possibility of 19.2 @xmath57line from 4u 1700 + 24 to be a ne one giving @xmath60 and the star to be a strange star . in fig.([fig : mrz35_40 g ] ) , we plotted two lines one for @xmath61 and the other for @xmath62 in the mass(m)-radius(r ) parameter space which cuts the m - r relation obtained form our eos giving realistic values of mass and radius .",
    "for @xmath54 we find a star of mass slightly larger than 1.1 @xmath4 ( fulfilling the condition m @xmath63 1.1 for exo 0748@xmath2676 as demanded by cottam , paerels and mendez ( 2002 ) ) and radius 7.0 @xmath64 .",
    "again , for 0.4 we get a star with mass 1.2 @xmath4 and radius 7.5 @xmath64 .",
    "so the possibility of exo 0748@xmath2676 and 4u 1700 + 24 to be strange stars are quite open .",
    "on the other hand , sanwal @xmath14 ( 2002 ) discussed that the absorption lines from 1e1207@xmath25209 have @xmath65 which corresponds to m @xmath66 and r @xmath67 .",
    "these values may appear to be unrealistic , but the fact is that the authors explained the absorption lines as a result of atomic transitions while in ss model the origin of absorption lines are completely different ( as discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "therefore , contradicting current quotes in the literature ( tiengo et al .",
    "2005 , cottam et al .",
    "2002 and miller 2002 ) , our ss model can explain redshifts observed from some compact stars .    in the next figure we plot with mass and radius of the strange star and",
    "see that for @xmath68 one can get a star of mass 1.55 @xmath4 and the radius is somewhat smaller - about 7.4 @xmath64 .",
    "we hope that a look at these curves will dispel the mistaken notion ( cottam et al .",
    "2002 & miller , 2002 ) that strange stars can not fit exo 748@xmath2676 .",
    "we now discuss the possibility of anti strange stars discussed by boehm et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and oaknin & zhitnitsky ( 2005 ) .",
    "if such stars exist then they will have an atmosphere of positrons rather than electrons spilling outside the star radius by a few hundred @xmath69 .",
    "these positrons will then interact with electrons of the normal matter accreting onto the strange star from its binary partner and positron - electron annihilation will produce the 511 @xmath5 @xmath70-pair .",
    "the only snag in this scenario was that for these anti - quark stars to be stable the surface tension has to be large ( alcock & olinto , 1989 ) .",
    "recently we have shown that in our ress model the surface tension is large unlike the bag model ( bagchi et al .",
    "2005b ) and such anti - strange stars are indeed likely to be stable .",
    "this partially solves the problem of baryonic dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe",
    ".    one must affirm that it is quite possible that there are two types of compact stars , namely neutron stars ( ns ) and strange stars . indeed , a clear possibility of existence of these two kinds of stars is discussed very recently by bombaci , parenti and vidana ( 2004 ) and these authors showed a phase transition from ns to ss can account for delayed gamma ray bursts .",
    "we have shown that the observed gravitational redshift @xmath71 can be explained by our ss model with built in properties of qcd . also harmonic bands in the spectrum",
    "may convincingly prove the existence of strange stars .",
    "we hope that with the profuse data that is flowing in , one will find more stars like 4u 1700@xmath5924 so that the strange star hypothesis can be put through a stringent test .",
    "further data on residuals for 1e1207@xmath25209 will also be very interesting .",
