    "the spectroscopic signature of the presence of @xmath0li in the atmospheres of metal - poor halo stars is a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the @xmath1li doublet , which can only be detected in spectra of the highest quality .",

    "* asplund  ( 2006 ) ) report the detection of @xmath0li in nine of these objects .",
    "the average @xmath0li/@xmath1li isotopic ratio in the nine stars in which @xmath0li has been detected is @xmath2(li ) @xmath7 and is very similar in each of these stars , defining a @xmath0li plateau at approximately @xmath8li@xmath9 ( on the scale @xmath10h@xmath11 ) .",
    "a convincing theoretical explanation of this new @xmath0li plateau turned out to be problematic .",
    "even when the depletion of the @xmath0li isotope during the pre - main - sequence phase would be ignored , the high abundances of @xmath0li at the lowest metallicities can not be explained by current models of galactic cosmic - ray production ( for a concise review see",

    "* cayrel  ( 2007 ) ) , who point out that the intrinsic line asymmetry caused by convection in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishable from the asymmetry produced by a weak @xmath0li blend on a presumed symmetric @xmath1li profile . as a consequence",

    "* wedemeyer   2004 ) , see also http://www.astro.uu.se/@xmath13bf/co5bold_main.html ) , we quantify the theoretical effect of the convection - induced line asymmetry on the resulting @xmath0li abundance as a function of effective temperature , gravity , and metallicity , for a parameter range that covers the stars of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* asplund  ( 2006 ) ) sample .",
    "the hydrodynamical atmospheres used in the present study are part of the cifist 3d model atmosphere grid , as described by @xcite .",
    "they have been obtained from realistic numerical simulations with the co@xmath12bold code which solves the time - dependent equations of compressible hydrodynamics in a constant gravity field together with the equations of non - local , frequency - dependent radiative transfer in a cartesian box representative of a volume located at the stellar surface .",
    "the computational domain is periodic in @xmath14 and @xmath15 direction , has open top and bottom boundaries , and is resolved by typically 140@xmath16140@xmath16150 grid points .",
    "the vertical optical depth of the box varies from @xmath17 ( top ) to @xmath18 ( bottom ) .",
    "the selected models cover the stellar parameter range @xmath19  k  @xmath20  k , @xmath21 , @xmath22 [ fe / h ] @xmath23 .",
    "each of the selected models is represented by about 20 snapshots chosen from the full time sequence of the corresponding simulation .",
    "all these representative snapshots are processed by the non - lte code nlte3d that solves the statistical equilibrium equations for a 17 level lithium atom with 34 line transitions , fully taking into account the 3d thermal structure of the respective model atmosphere .",
    "the photo - ionizing radiation field is computed at @xmath24 frequency points between @xmath25 and 32407   , using the opacity distribution functions of @xcite to allow for metallicity - dependent line - blanketing , including the hi ",
    "h@xmath26 and hi  hi quasi - molecular absorption near @xmath27 and @xmath28   , respectively .",
    "collisional ionization by neutral hydrogen via the charge transfer reaction h(@xmath29 ) + li(@xmath30 ) @xmath31 li@xmath26(@xmath32 ) + h@xmath33 is treated according to @xcite .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .",
    "finally , 3d non - lte synthetic line profiles of the lii @xmath4  feature are computed with the line formation code linfor3d ( http://www.aip.de/@xmath13mst/linfor3d_main.html ) , using the departure coefficients @xmath34 provided by nlte3d for each level @xmath35 of the lithium model atom as a function of geometrical position within the 3d model atmospheres . as demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] , 3d non - lte effects are very important for the metal - poor dwarfs considered here : not only is the 3d lte equivalent width too large by more than a factor 2 , but also is the half - width of the 3d lte line profile too narrow by about 10% .",
    "moreover , the lithium lines are significantly less asymmetric if the non - lte effects are taken into account . +",
    "as outlined above , the @xmath0li abundance is necessarily overestimated if one ignores the intrinsic asymmetry of the @xmath1li line profile . to quantify this error theoretically , we rely only on synthetic spectra .",
    "the idea is to represent the observation by the synthetic 3d non - lte line profile of the @xmath1li line blend .",
    "this 3d flux profile is computed with zero @xmath0li content . except for an optional rotational broadening , the only source of non - thermal line broadening is the 3d hydrodynamical velocity field , which also gives rise to a convective blue - shift and an intrinsic line asymmetry .",
    "next we compute a small grid of 1d lte synthetic line profiles of the full @xmath0li/@xmath1li blend from a so - called 1d lhd model , a 1d mixing - length model atmosphere that has the same stellar parameters and uses the same microphysics and radiative transfer scheme as the corresponding 3d model .",
    "the parameters of the grid are the total @xmath0li+@xmath1li abundance , @xmath36(li ) , and the @xmath0li/@xmath1li isotopic ratio , @xmath2(li ) .",
    "microturbulence is fixed at @xmath37  km / s , @xmath38 is identical to the value used in the 3d spectrum synthesis ( we tried @xmath39 and @xmath40  km / s ) .",
    "now the 1d line profiles from the grid are used to fit the 3d profile .",
    "four parameters are varied independently to find the best fit ( minimum @xmath41 ) : in addition to @xmath36(li ) and @xmath2(li ) , which control line strength and line asymmetry , respectively , we also allow for an extra line broadening characterized by @xmath42 of the gaussian kernel , and a global line shift , @xmath43 .",
    "the value @xmath44(li ) of the best fit is then identified with the correction @xmath45(li ) that has to be _ subtracted _ from the @xmath0li/@xmath1li isotopic ratio determined from the 1d lte analysis in order to correct for the bias introduced by the intrinsic line asymmetry : @xmath45(li ) = @xmath44(li ) , and @xmath46(li ) = @xmath47(li ) - @xmath45(li ) .",
    "the procedure takes saturation effects properly into account .",
    "we have determined @xmath45(li ) in the relevant range of stellar parameters according to the method outlined above .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.[fig2 ] for [ fe / h]=@xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "at given metallicity , the corrections are largest for low gravity and high effective temperature , increasing towards higher metallicity .",
    "we note that @xmath45(li ) is essentially insensitive to the choice of @xmath38",
    ". the downward correction of the @xmath0li/@xmath1li isotopic ratio is typically in the range @xmath50(li ) @xmath51 for the stars of the @xcite sample ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . after subtracting for each of these stars the individual @xmath5(li ) , according to @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the mean @xmath0li/@xmath1li isotopic ratio of the sample is reduced from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , as illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] . if we keep the error bars given by @xcite , the number of stars with a @xmath0li detection above the 2@xmath56 level decreases from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "one of them , hd106038 , survives only because of its particularly small error bar of @xmath59 , another one , cd-30  18140 , just barely fulfills the 2@xmath56 criterion .",
    "the remaining two stars are g020 - 024 , which shows the clearest evidence for the presence of @xmath0li ( @xmath2(li )  @xmath60 ) , and hd102200 with a somewhat weaker @xmath0li signal ( @xmath2(li )  @xmath61 ) .",
    "the spectra of these stars should be reanalyzed with 3d non - lte line profiles .",
    ".fitting three observed lii @xmath4     spectra with 1d lte and 3d non - lte synthetic line profiles , respectively .",
    "columns ( 7)-(10 ) show the results for @xmath38 = 0.0 / 2.0 km / s . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as a consistency check",
    ", we have also fitted a few observed lii @xmath4    spectra with 1d  lte and 3d  non - lte synthetic line profiles , respectively .",
    "the fitting parameters are again @xmath36(li ) , @xmath2(li ) , @xmath42 , and @xmath43",
    ". as expected , the 3d analysis yields lower @xmath2(li ) by roughly @xmath62 .",
    "details are compiled in table[tab1 ] . hd74000 and g271@xmath63162 are considered non - detections , while hd84937 remains a clear @xmath0li detection with @xmath46(li ) @xmath64 .",
    "the present study indicates that only @xmath40 or at most @xmath58 out of the @xmath65 stars of the @xcite sample remain significant @xmath0li detections when subjected to a 3d  non - lte analysis , suggesting that the presence of @xmath0li in the atmospheres of galactic halo stars is rather the exception than the rule .",
    "this would imply that it is no longer necessary to look for a global mechanism accounting for a @xmath0li enrichment of the galactic halo , but that it is sufficient to explain only a few exceptional cases , which is probably much easier ."
