    "at passage of ultrarelativistic charged particles through amorphous matter , they undergo multiple , essentially uncorrelated scattering on atoms , typically through small angles .",
    "if the target is not too thick , the longitudinal momentum of a high - energy particle may be regarded as conserved .",
    "then , the transport equation depends only on the particle deflection angles , and is exactly solvable by means of fourier transformation @xcite .",
    "however , conditions of multiple coulomb scattering on screened atomic nuclei may require one to separately treat hard and soft contributions to the distribution function , as was first pointed out by williams @xcite .",
    "that separation was cast in the form of a large - thickness expansion by molire @xcite , subsequently reviewed by bethe @xcite , and nowadays is recognized as a standard procedure ( see @xcite ) . in modern practice , yet a simplified approach is applied at times , retaining only the gaussian component with the root mean square angle inferred from gaussian fits @xcite , or derived analytically from the molre theory @xcite .",
    "but in high - statistics experiments , non - gaussian  wings \" are noticeable even for rather thick targets .",
    "although molire s expansion provides a formal background for the theory , from the physical point of view it is not completely satisfactory .",
    "it is known that , in principle , it does not converge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and yet , is comprised of oscillatory functions of deflection angles , which do not admit independent probabilistic interpretation . at the same time , there were recent phenomenological indications that beyond the central gaussian region , the distribution function does not immediately switch to the asymptotic power law corresponding to single scattering , but exhibits some transient behavior over a sizable range of angles @xcite .    in case such a transition region",
    "does exist , the best option to compute within it the distribution function would be to resum all the non - gaussian ( at least , power - law ) contributions through all orders , as is done in other physical problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . that typically leads to integral representations for resummed quantities .",
    "but in the present case , one can employ to this end a method @xcite , in which the original fourier integral representation for the distribution function is extended into the complex plane , and two principally different ( vertical and horizontal ) parts of the integration path are distinguished .",
    "that method so far has never developed to a procedure superior to molire s expansion ; nonetheless , with some improvements , it can be raised to that status , and provide a different view on behavior of the angular distribution beyond the central region .",
    "the key notion here is that integrals over the mentioned parts of the path appear to be positive , and therefore may be interpreted as hard and soft scattering components , coexisting at any scattering angle .",
    "comparison of those components will allow us to determine the width of the transition region between gaussian and rutherford regions in the aggregate distribution , and assess the significance of resummation of all the plural hard - scattering contributions .",

    "the random walk in the plane of deflection angles ( which may be viewed as transverse vectors ) must reduce to diffusion . in generic integral representations ( [ 2dfourier ] ) and ( [ f - proj - def ] ) , that comes about as follows : at large @xmath12 , the exponential in their integrands is rapidly decreasing , therefore the contributing @xmath13 or @xmath14 are small , permitting one to expand the exponent to leading order in their values .",
    "however , naive expansion @xmath15 in the integrand gives a logarithmically diverging variance @xmath16 , given that the physical differential cross - section of fast charged particle scattering on one atom through large angles obeys the rutherford asymptotics @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the particle momentum , @xmath19 the nucleus charge , and @xmath20 the fine structure constant .",
    "a more accurate calculation @xcite shows that the small-@xmath13 asymptotics of the exponent in ( [ 2dfourier ] ) , ( [ f - proj - def ] ) involves a factor logarithmically depending on @xmath13 : @xmath21\\underset{\\rho\\chi'_a\\to0}\\simeq\\frac{\\chi_c^2\\rho^2}2\\ln\\frac{2}{\\chi'_a\\rho},\\ ] ] and thereby spoiling the gaussianity of the fourier - bessel integral .",

    "thus , the diffusion here is anomalous , but only marginally , in the sense that the anomaly is logarithmic instead of a power law .",
    "that implies that the distribution function does _ not _ approach a lvy distribution @xcite , albeit is not strictly gaussian either .",
    "ratio @xmath33 essentially measures the target thickness in units of the radiation length @xmath34 : @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 expressible in terms of @xmath34 , as well [ see , e.g. , @xcite , eq .  ( 42 ) ] .",
    "for instance , ratio @xmath38 corresponds to targets of solid materials of a few millimeter thickness . in what follows",

    "approximation ( [ j0-square - log ] ) appreciably simplifies the structure of integrals ( [ 2dfourier ] ) , ( [ f - proj - def ] ) , but their evaluation still involves non - trivial aspects .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that the diffusion , at least at typical angles , must be close to gaussian , although with possible logarithmic deviations . to tackle those , molire @xcite assumed that the typical deflection angle is @xmath39 , with @xmath40 such that the difference of logarithmically large parameters @xmath41 is a constant of the order of unity ( conventionally set to be zero ) .",
    "therewith , @xmath42 is a lambert ( or product logarithm ) function , asymptotically equal @xmath43 , and the rhs of ( [ j0-square - log ] ) rewrites as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",

    "an important consequence of ( [ fk - moliere - def ] ) is that for all @xmath52 , @xmath53 hence , functions @xmath54 at @xmath52 are not everywhere positive , and do not admit probabilistic interpretation .",
    "analyzing integrals ( [ fk - moliere - def ] ) , one finds that at large @xmath55 , components of ( [ moliere - expansion ] ) behave as @xmath56 , which corresponds to a perfect gaussian , and @xmath57 , which reflects the rutherford asymptotics @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 times logarithmic factors ( which will be determined below ) .",
    "further analysis reveals that , in fact , functions @xmath54 for @xmath52 make several oscillations , increases , factor @xmath61 in the integrand of ( [ fk - moliere - def ] ) becomes sharply peaking at @xmath62 .",
    "therewith , at fixed @xmath55 and increasing @xmath63 , integral ( [ fk - moliere - def ] ) tends to @xmath64 for @xmath65 , the latter scaling law was quoted in @xcite . ] which are much stronger than the asymptotic power - law  tails \" . at moderate @xmath66 , they may cause a spurious warp in between the gaussian and rutherford regions . yet , despite the factor @xmath67 in the denominator in the rhs of ( [ fk - moliere - def ] ) , functions @xmath54 _ grow _ with @xmath63 faster than exponentially [ see eq .",
    "( [ ln^kk ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , in principle , series ( [ moliere - expansion ] ) diverges , though it may still serve as an asymptotic expansion in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "even though at typical angles the number of scatterings in any macroscopic target is very large , at significant deflection angles the distribution function may be determined by just a few hard scatterings .",

    "the corresponding asymptotics of the integral thus equals @xmath78 , but it is exactly canceled by the second term of ( [ proj - f2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , to determine the asymptotics of @xmath79 , one has to expand the slowly varying factors in the integrand to higher orders : @xmath80 here @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , wherewith @xmath83 hence , if one considers a  form factor \" @xmath84 , which vanishes at @xmath85 , and tends to a constant as @xmath86 , it appears to be a nonmonotonous function of @xmath71 , and overshoots the latter constant at some intermediate @xmath71 .",
    "that salient feature of the multiple coulomb scattering angular distribution was confirmed experimentally ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , it can be proven that higher - order terms in ( [ series - f - thetax ] ) are all positive and asymptotically scale as @xmath87    for polar angle distribution @xmath88 the asymptotics of the leading terms of the expansion is @xmath89 @xmath90 and generally @xmath91    note that the coefficients at logarithms in eqs .",

    "thus , at moderately large @xmath0 , it would be advantageous to sum such contributions through all orders .",
    "resummations of that kind are usually carried out via borel transformation @xcite .",
    "but in our case , construction of a new integral representation is unnecessary , as long as the original integral representation ( [ 2dfourier ] ) or ( [ f - proj - def ] ) is already well suited for that purpose .",
    "below we will derive corresponding resumming expressions directly from integrals ( [ 2dfourier ] ) and ( [ f - proj - def ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in the case when the number of collisions is high , the exponent in integrals ( [ 2dfourier ] ) , ( [ f - proj - def ] ) will generally assume large values .",
    "the modern approach to deriving asymptotics of such integrals consists in extending the integral into a complex plane . with an appropriate choice of the integration path",

    "here we are going to handle the entire sequence of asymptotic terms simultaneously , but in order to make it applicable _ everywhere _ , the definition of the integration path must be improved .",

    "the main conclusions of our paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "a continuation into the complex plane allows presenting the angular distribution of probability of particles scattered in amorphous matter as a sum of hard- and soft - scattering components , with no restriction on the number of scatterings . at that",
    ", the hard component incorporates all the plural - scattering power - law corrections to the rutherford single - scattering contribution , while the soft component is nearly gaussian , but is narrower than molire s @xmath136 . due to their positivity almost everywhere , those components admit independent ( pseudo)probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the corresponding total percentage of hard - scattered particles ( not appearing naturally in the molire theory ) amounts typically @xmath218 for the projected angle distribution , and @xmath219 in case of the polar angle distribution ) , and sets the accuracy limit for gauss - like approximations for the soft component .",
    "the second conclusion is that in the aggregate distribution of scattered particles , there is a significant transition region between multiple soft and single hard scattering , in which scattering is multiple but hard .",
    "physically , it is chained to the fact that at significant target thickness , there always exists a range of angles , where the probability of several hard rescatterings is non - negligible .",
    "the resummed hard - scattering component peaks at a non - zero deflection angle , and around its maximum ( in the so - called semihard region ) , it exceeds the single hard scattering ( rutherford ) contribution by a significant factor .",
    "nonetheless , no bump emerges in the aggregate distribution around this angle , inasmuch as in the semihard region , the hard component is comparable with the soft one .    from the practical point of view , it must be noted that if it is desired to use a single approximation within the central region of scattering angles only , it may be reasonable to employ molire s @xmath136 ; but if the hard  tail \" needs description , as well , it is advantageous to use the separation @xmath220 introduced herein . even after approximating @xmath143 by a quasi - gaussian ,",
    "the sum @xmath220 is still numerically more accurate than a few first terms of the molire expansion . besides that",
    ", it should be remembered that the separation of @xmath113 and @xmath151 somewhat depends on the choice of the corner point for the integration path ( which does not coincide with the saddle point of the integrand exactly ) , and thus may involve slight ambiguity .",
    "analytic solutions of the corner point equation provide insight into qualitative dependencies of the particle distribution function on the total deflection angle and the target thickness , but may sometimes be insufficiently accurate , so , if better precision is required , the saddle point equation is to be solved numerically .",
    "thus , depending on the needs of the study , the proposed construction may be used either for analytic , or for numerical purposes ."
