    "spectroscopic observations of meteors reveal not only the chemical composition of the cometary meteoroids but also the emission processes of hypervelocity impacts in the atmosphere ; these processes are difficult to reproduce in laboratory experiments at present .",
    "leonid meteoroids that correspond to cometary grains from the comet 55p / tempel - tuttle have produced the best meteor shower because of its high incident velocity at @xmath572 km s@xmath6 among known annual meteor showers and because of the bright flux of its meteors at @xmath510,000 hr@xmath6 .",
    "of particular interest is the question as to whether or not meteoroids could have delivered organics and water to the early earth @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that leonid meteors are large aggregates that might include precursors to the interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) and that the survival of meteoritic compounds through the atmospheric entry is feasible even if its at high - velocity ablation . to determine whether large cometary grains contain mineral water or trapped water in any forms , it is necessary to confirm the presence of oh @xmath7 emission around a wavelength of 310 nm .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported an excess of emission at 310 nm .    here",
    "we report the discovery of n@xmath8 [ n@xmath1(1 ) ] in the wavelength range of 320 - 450 nm meteor emission from a leonid meteoroid through the investigation of the oh @xmath9@xmath10 ( 0,0 ) band .",
    "the n@xmath1(1 ) plasma emission in meteors has been argued by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite found a n@xmath11 meinel band in the range of 780 - 840 nm .",
    "thus , our discovery is important for identifying unknown meteor emissions in the ultraviolet region , in particular , for understanding the variety of emission phases in meteors and the delivery mechanisms of organic matter , content minerals , and water .",
    "during the 2001 leonid maximum , spectroscopic observations were carried out using image - intensified high - definition tv ( ii - hdtv ) cameras in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , visible ( vis ) , and near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelength regions ( 250 - 700 nm ) . the ii - hdtv system consisted of a uv image intensifier ( @xmath12 18 -mm photocathode : s20 ) , two relay lenses ( f=50 mm , f/1.4 ) , and an hdtv camera with a 2 mega pixels ccd . in order to focus precise optical concentration on the wavelength range of 250 - 1000 nm , we developed uv lenses of f=30 mm , f/1.2 with a field of view of 23@xmath13 13@xmath14 .",
    "the hdtv digital imagery has 1920 ( horizontal ) @xmath2 1035 ( vertical ) pixels that result in 6 times higher resolution than the ntsc / pal standard video conversion system .",
    "the recording rate was 30 frames ( 60 fields ) per second .",
    "spectroscopic observations were performed by the ii - hdtv system equipped with a reflection grating , which is 500 grooves mm@xmath6 , blazed at 330 nm , manufactured by the richardson grating laboratory .",
    "background stars were removed by subtracting a median frame shortly before the appearance of the meteor .",
    "after flat - fielding and averaging the meteor spectrum , the wavelength was determined carefully by means of numerous well - known atomic lines in the meteor emission .",
    "the effective spectral sensitivity of the instrument , including atmospheric extinction during the observations , was constructed by measuring spectra of bright stars in the observing field .",
    "its sensitivity covered the wavelength at 300 - 700 nm , with the maximum at @xmath5430 nm .",
    "the resulting dispersion of the spectrum is 0.37 nm pixel@xmath6 , and fwhm = 2.5 nm in the first order . since no order - sorting filter was used , it turns out that the first - order spectrum was mixed with the second - order spectrum in the wavelength longer than 600 nm .",
    "details of the instrument and the first results of the ii - hdtv spectrum of 1999 leonids were described in @xcite .",
    "ozone in the stratosphere strongly absorbs below 290 nm , preventing the uv light from reaching the earth s surface . in order to prevent air extinction owing to mainly aerosol scattering in the uv wavelength below 380 nm ,",
    "the spectroscopic observation was performed at a high - altitude site in the nobeyama radio observatory of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( n35.@xmath1493 , e138.@xmath1448 , altitude = 1340 m ) .",
    "thanks to excellent observing conditions , clear weather , and strong meteor storm activity during the leonid maximum , its peak activity was well observed around 18:16 ut on 2001 november 18 with the zenithal hourly rate of 3730 , based on reports of the nippon meteor society and the international meteor organization @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] , we show a clear spectrum of a leonid meteor fireball , which was obtained at 18:58:20 ut on 2001 november 18 , within a dust trail ejected by comet 55p / tempel - tuttle in 1866 @xcite . assuming the leonid radiant ( @xmath15 = + 153 @xmath14 , @xmath16 = + 22@xmath14 ) and velocity ( 72 km s@xmath6 ) , the meteor distance @xmath17 and its altitude @xmath18 at each frame were inferable .",
    "the altitudes for the fireball entering our field of view and for it disappearing were @xmath18 = 108.1 km ( @xmath17 = 136.8 km ) and @xmath18 = 80.1 km ( @xmath17 = 124.6 km ) , respectively .    from a comparison between meteor emission lines and the field - star spectrum , a maximum brightness of  4 visual magnitude at the standard range of 100 km",
    "was derived , which corresponded to a photometric meteoroid mass of @xmath51.8 g and a diameter of @xmath515 mm by assuming a density of 1.0 g @xmath4 for the leonid meteoroids .",
    "all spectral luminosities were normalized at 100 km altitude above the observer . in the next section ,",
    "we shall focus on the best spectrum at @xmath19 = 0.434 s and @xmath18 = 84.1 km among these sequences .",
    "first , in order to consider atomic lines only , we focus on emission lines in the uv - vis region below 450 nm , where the measurement of the sensitivity calibration is expected to be the brightest . assuming the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , the atomic synthetic spectrum was computed by adjusting five parameters : temperature @xmath20 and the column densities of four atoms ( fe , mg , ca , and na ) .",
    "we made sure that all other possible atoms , such as h , n , o , al , si , ti , cr , mn , co , of ni , could be negligible in this wavelength region because these minor emissions blended into strong emission lines owing to low - resolution spectroscopy and because no significant contribution was identified .",
    "this analytical method was described in @xcite . in general ,",
    "meteor spectra consist of two components at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "a typical temperature of the `` main ( warm ) component , '' which contains most of the above spectral lines , is @xmath21 4500 k. the `` second ( hot ) component '' is excited at @xmath21 10,000 k and consists of a few ionized elements such as and .",
    "although overlaps of numerous iron lines prevented us from determining the precise temperature owing to rather low - resolution spectroscopy , lte temperatures of 4100 - 4700 k for the main spectrum of this leonid meteor have resulted in all spectrum frames , except saturated frames .",
    "thus , we applied typical temperatures of 4500 and 10,000 k for its warm and hot component spectra , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the comparison between observed and synthetic atomic spectra .",
    "the resulting column density of atoms was 2 @xmath2 10@xmath22 @xmath23 , and we derived the following atomic ratios in the radiation gas : / = 11 , / = 0.1 , and / = 0.03 .",
    "higher than chondritic mg / fe ratio was also detected in a 2001 leonid fireball @xcite .",
    "after the comparison between observed and synthetic spectra in figure [ fig2 ] , we found that these atomic lines could not help us identify some unknown bands around 350 and 330 nm .",
    "these unknown bands clearly appeared from @xmath19 = 0.167 s ( @xmath18 = 100.1 km ) and suddenly disappeared after @xmath19 = 0.467 s ( @xmath18 = 82.1 km ) . the 350 nm excess was particularly strong . in order to explain these enhancements in accuracy , the spradian numerical code considering with franck - condon factors , which can produce a molecular spectrum at the appropriate temperature and density ,",
    "was used @xcite . as a result , the best account for two excess bands at 330 and 350 nm was found to be the `` first negative @xmath24@xmath10 '' band of the molecular nitrogen ion n@xmath1(1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the model spectrum of n@xmath1(1 ) with four bands heads ( 329.3 , 353.4 , 391.4 , and 427.8 nm ) caused by different vibrational states of ( v,v)=(2,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,0 ) , and ( 0,1 ) , respectively .",
    "the model spectrum is wonderfully in complete agreement with the observational spectrum in the uv range from 320 to 360 nm .",
    "this finding is the first detection of the n@xmath1 @xmath24@xmath10 molecule in the uv meteor spectrum .",
    "the final values of number densities and chemical abundances for this meteor spectrum are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] and  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the presence of the molecular nitrogen ion n@xmath1(1 ) in meteor spectra was first suspected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of the ( 0 , 1 ) and the ( 0 , 0 ) bands in the spectra of faint 3 - 5 mag meteors with the aid of intensified tv cameras .",
    "however , since the resolution was low ( @xmath55 nm ) , the presence of these bands could not be separated from the strong emissions of at 422.7 and at 393.4 nm . also , the ( 0 , 0 ) band was almost at the edge of the their instrumental sensitivity .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a clear contribution of at 422.7 nm and many iron lines that overlap with the ( 0 , 1 ) band .",
    "in addition to that , these ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 1 ) bands of n@xmath1(1 ) were never found in fireballs .",
    "that is , previous reports could not identify the n@xmath25(1 ) because it was difficult to detect these bands clearly in the vis region because of the overlaps with strong ca and fe emissions .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found excessive emissions between 770 and 840 nm with the maximums centered at @xmath5789 and @xmath5815 nm , which could be caused by the `` first negative @xmath9@xmath10 '' band of the molecular nitrogen ion n@xmath1 meinel bands .",
    "the evidence of a n@xmath1 meinel system was identified in two fireballs ( with magnitudes of  1 and  7 ) obtained during the leonid meteor shower in 2001 and 2002 leonid multi - instrument aircraft campaign ( mac ; @xcite .",
    "because their unintensified slitless ccd spectrograph could provide a high spectral resolution with the precise determination of wavelength in the near - ir region , these must be reliable findings . in their research ,",
    "the lte abundances ( @xmath20 = 4400 k ) of [ n@xmath1]/[n@xmath27 for the  1 and  7 mag fireballs were estimated at 5 @xmath2 10@xmath28 and 2 @xmath2 @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "in addition to this , a tentative identification of the fist negative n@xmath1 @xmath24@xmath10 ( 0 , 0 ) band in the vis region was proposed @xcite .",
    "although the spectral resolution in our observation was about an order less than jenniskens results , we could take full advantage of the sensitivity in the uv region below 380 nm .",
    "it is obvious that the spectrum enhancement around 350 and 330 nm can be explained by band heads of n@xmath1 @xmath24@xmath10 ( 1 , 0 ) at 353.4 nm and ( 2 , 0 ) at 329.3 nm .",
    "the second positive bands of the neutral n@xmath30 molecule were not identified in the uv - vis range , which should contribute as a background .",
    "we inferred an upper limit of neutral n@xmath30 of @xmath51.0 @xmath2 10@xmath31 @xmath4 by assuming an lte temperature of 4500 k @xcite .",
    "the best - fit calculation mixed with atomic lines leads to an n@xmath1(1 ) vibrational temperature of 10,000 k. if we assume an n@xmath1 temperature of 4500 k , the estimated abundance of [ n@xmath1]/[n@xmath27 leads to @xmath5 1 @xmath2 10@xmath28 , which is consistent with the results from @xcite .",
    "however , the best - fitted spectrum clearly proves that n@xmath1(1 ) belongs to the `` hot component '' of @xmath20 = 10,000 k. figure [ fig3 ] indicates the synthetic spectrum assuming @xmath20 = 4400 k , which is clearly different from the observed spectrum .",
    "furthermore , another piece of possible evidence for this hot component being assigned to n@xmath1 is that the light curves of n@xmath1 emission is more similar to ionized mg at 448.1 nm which belongs to hot component , rather than neutral mg at 517.8 nm which belongs to warm component ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the n@xmath1(1 ) system was surprisingly strong ; its total flux between 300 and 450 nm was 1.44 @xmath2 10@xmath32 ( w m@xmath33 sr@xmath6 ) even when the calculated number density of n@xmath1 molecules was extremely small as 1.55 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ; i.e. , [ n@xmath1]/[n@xmath27 = 1.5 @xmath2 10@xmath34 .",
    "few reports have clarified the uv ( 300 - 350 nm ) meteor spectra in the past @xcite , and strong features related to n@xmath1(1 ) had never been reported before . on the other hand ,",
    "similar features around 350 nm can be seen in spectra of 1999 leonid meteoroids obtained by @xcite and in our fireball spectra observed in 2002 leonids ; both were observed during the leonid mac .",
    "n@xmath1(1 ) also could be observed in a shock layer of arc plasma heated by the reflected shock and by reentry spacecraft such as the space shuttle orbiter @xcite .",
    "the flow in the head and wake regions of a hypersonic object , such as a reentry capsule , tends to be in a thermochemical nonequilibrium state .",
    "the most likely scenario of the induced n@xmath1(1 ) in the meteoroid will result in the effect of large dimensions of high - temperature regions just ahead and behind the meteoroid caused by the large meteoroids vapor cloud .",
    "the reentry speed from interplanetary space is more than 12 km s@xmath6 at the altitude of 100 km , which is enough velocity for producing n@xmath1(1 ) suggested from laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reentry capsules ( meter - size meteoroids ) of @xmath35 ( solar wind sample return ) , @xmath36 ( cometary dust sample return ) , and @xmath37 ( asteroidal material sample return ) directly from interplanetary space , which will return to the earth in 2004 september , 2006 january , and 2007 june , respectively , will provide us with good opportunities to conduct artificial fireball spectroscopy tests in the future @xcite .",
