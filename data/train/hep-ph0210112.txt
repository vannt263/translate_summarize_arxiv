    "the successful operation of lep and sld in the past few years has provided precise experimental data @xcite with which the standard model ( sm ) and its proposed extensions must be confronted .",
    "the results for @xmath5 have converged @xcite , providing evidence for direct cp violation in the neutral kaon system . in addition , @xmath1 factories have begun producing data on @xmath1 decays and cp violation , which test the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements involving the top quark and the ckm phase @xmath6 . however , the determination of most parameters involving the top quark is still strongly model - dependent . while the ckm matrix elements that mix light quarks are extracted from tree - level processes ( and hence their measurement is model - independent to a large extent ) , the charged current couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 are derived from one - loop processes @xcite , to which new physics beyond the sm may well contribute .",
    "the tevatron determination of @xmath9 in top pair production @xcite is obtained assuming @xmath10 ckm unitarity , and the neutral current interactions of the top with the @xmath11 boson remain virtually unknown from the experimental point of view .",
    "this fact contrasts with the high precision achieved for the couplings of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks at lep and sld , obtained from the ratios @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetries @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the situation concerning cp violating phases is better ( see for instance ref .",
    "few years ago , the single phase @xmath6 present in the ckm matrix could merely be adjusted to reproduce the experimental value of the only cp violation observable available , @xmath18 in the kaon system . with the resolution of the conflict between the na31 and e731 values of @xmath5 , and",
    "the recent measurement of the cp asymmetry @xmath19 in the @xmath1 system @xcite , there are two new cp violation observables , both in agreement with the sm predictions , which allow to test the ckm picture of cp violation",
    ". experiments under way at @xmath1 factories keep investigating other cp asymmetries to dig out the phase structure of the ckm matrix .",
    "likewise , the knowledge of the top quark properties will improve in the next years , with the arrival of top factories , lhc and tesla @xcite .",
    "for instance , single top production at lhc @xcite will yield a measurement of @xmath9 with an accuracy of @xmath20 7% . in top pair production ,",
    "the angular distributions of the top decay products will provide a very precise determination of the structure of the @xmath21 vertex , even sensitive to qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "the prospects for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are less optimistic due to the difficulty in tagging the light quark jets .",
    "before top factories come into operation , it is natural to ask ourselves how large the departures from the sm predictions might be . answering this question means knowing how precisely one can indirectly fix the allowed values of the least known parameters , taking into account all the present relevant data from electroweak precision measurements and from kaon , @xmath22 and @xmath1 physics .",
    "we will show that there is still large room for new physics , which may manifest itself in the form of deviations of the properties of the known quarks from sm expectations .",
    "this is especially the case for the top quark , whose couplings are poorly known , and also for rare @xmath0 decays and cp asymmetries in the @xmath1 systems , which are currently being probed at @xmath0 and @xmath1 factories .    with this aim we study a class of sm extensions in which @xmath23 up - type or @xmath24 down - type quark singlets are added to the three sm families @xcite .",
    "these exotic quarks , often called vector - like , have both their left and right components transforming as singlets under @xmath25 , and therefore their addition to the sm quark content does not spoil the cancellation of the triangle anomalies . in these models , which are described in the next section , @xmath10 ckm unitarity does not necessarily hold , and mixing of the new quarks with the standard ones can lead to sizeable departures from the sm predictions @xcite . for instance , the ckm matrix elements @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the top neutral current couplings with the @xmath11 boson can be quite different from sm expectations . the ratio of branching fractions of the `` golden modes '' @xmath26 can have an enhancement of one order of magnitude with respect to the sm prediction , and the time - dependent cp asymmetry in the decay @xmath4 , which is predicted to be very small in the sm , can vary between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "apart from their simplicity and the potentially large effects on experimental observables , there are several theoretical reasons to consider quark isosinglets . down",
    "singlets appear in grand unification theories @xcite , for instance those based on the gauge group @xmath29 ( in the 27 representation of @xmath29 a @xmath24 singlet is associated to each fermion family ) .",
    "the presence of down singlets does not spoil gauge coupling unification , as long as they are embedded within the 27 representation of @xmath29 @xcite . when added to the sm particle content",
    ", they can improve the convergence of the couplings , but not as well as in the minimal supersymmetric sm @xcite .",
    "models with large extra dimensions with for instance @xmath30 in the bulk predict the existence of a tower of @xmath23 singlets @xmath31 . if there is multilocalisation the lightest one , @xmath32 , can have a mass @xmath33 gev or larger and an observable mixing with the top @xcite . similarly , if @xmath34 is in the bulk , there exists a tower of @xmath35 , but the mixing with sm fermions is suppressed in relation to the top case if the higgs is restricted to live on the boundary .",
    "there are three recent studies regarding the constraints on models with extra singlets @xcite . in this work",
    ", we extend these analyses in three main aspects : ( _ i _ ) we include up singlets , as well as down singlets , referring to them as model i and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "( _ ii _ ) we study the limits on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , top neutral current couplings and other observables not previously analysed ; ( _ iii _ ) we take a larger set of experimental constraints into account : the correlated measurement of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; oblique corrections ; the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mass differences ; the cp violation observables @xmath18 , @xmath5 , @xmath19 ; the decays @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; @xmath47 processes and atomic parity violation . in addition , we examine several other potential restrictions , which turn out to be less important than the previous ones .",
    "we allow mixing of all the generations with either @xmath23 or @xmath24 exotic quarks , and we consider that one or two singlets can mix significantly , though for brevity in the notation we always refer to one extra singlet @xmath48 or @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] the main features of the models are described . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we summarise the direct limits on ckm matrix elements and the masses of the new quarks . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we review the constraints from precision electroweak data : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , asymmetries and oblique corrections . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we focus our attention on flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) processes at low energies : meson mixing , @xmath1 decays and kaon decays .",
    "the various constraints on the @xmath11 couplings of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 quarks are studied in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "we introduce the formalism necessary for the discussion of some observables from @xmath0 and @xmath1 physics in section  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "we present the results in section  [ sec:8 ] , and in section  [ sec:9 ] we draw our conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : ap1 ] we collect the common input parameters for our calculations , and in appendix  [ sec : ap2 ] the inami - lim functions needed .",
    "the statistical prescriptions used in our analysis are explained in appendix  [ sec : ap3 ] .",
    "in order to fix our notation briefly , in this section we will be a little more general than needed in the rest of the paper ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for an extended discussion including isodoublets and mirror quarks too ) .",
    "we consider a sm extension with @xmath51 standard quark families and @xmath52 up , @xmath53 down vector - like singlets .",
    "the total numbers of up and down quarks , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , are not necessarily equal . in these models ,",
    "the charged and neutral current terms of the lagrangian in the weak eigenstate basis can be written in matrix notation as @xmath56 with @xmath57 doublets under @xmath25 of dimension @xmath51 in flavour space .",
    "these terms have the same structure as in the sm , with @xmath51 generations of left - handed doublets in the isospin - related terms , but with all the @xmath58 , @xmath59 fields in @xmath60 .",
    "the differences show up in the mass eigenstate basis , where the lagrangian reads @xmath61 here @xmath62 and @xmath63 are @xmath58 and @xmath64 dimensional vectors , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 are matrices of dimension @xmath67 , @xmath68 , respectively . in general the @xmath69 ckm matrix @xmath70 is neither unitary nor square .",
    "the most distinctive feature of this class of models is the appearance of tree - level fcn couplings in the mass eigenstate basis , originated by the mixing of weak eigenstates with the same chirality and different isospin .",
    "these fcn interactions mix left - handed fields , and are determined by the off - diagonal entries in the matrices @xmath65 , @xmath66 . on the other hand , the diagonal @xmath71 terms of up- or down - type mass eigenstates @xmath72 are ( dropping here the superscript on the @xmath73 matrices ) @xmath74 with the plus ( minus ) sign for up ( down ) quarks . with these definitions ,",
    "the flavour - diagonal @xmath71 vertices read @xmath75 for a sm - like mass eigenstate without any left - handed singlet component , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and it has standard interactions with the @xmath11 boson .",
    "for a mass eigenstate with singlet components , @xmath79 , what implies nonzero fcn couplings @xmath80 as well .      the equality for @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ ec:6 ] ) holds in particular if @xmath101 .",
    "likewise , the equality for @xmath66 holds when @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that the introduction of _ only one _ extra singlet mixing significantly ( as it is usually done in the literature ) results in additional restrictions in the parameter space , and in principle may lead to different predictions .",
    "moreover , for @xmath101 or @xmath102 the ckm matrix has three independent cp violating phases , whereas for @xmath103 or @xmath104 there are five .",
    "hence , in our numerical analysis we will consider also the situation when two singlets can have large mixing , @xmath103 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 , @xmath104 , to give a more complete picture . in the rest of the paper",
    "we write the expressions for only one extra singlet for simplicity .",
    "even though in these sm extensions the @xmath10 ckm matrix is not unitary , in the two examples under study it is still a submatrix of a @xmath105 unitary matrix @xmath70 .",
    "the direct determination of the moduli of ckm matrix elements @xcite in table  [ tab:0 ] not only sets direct limits on these ckm elements themselves but also unitarity bounds on the rest .",
    "after the requirement of @xmath106 from precision electroweak data ( see section  [ sec:4 ] ) these bounds are stronger . in this case , the tevatron constraint @xcite @xmath107 is automatically satisfied .",

    "when @xmath150 is not considered as a fixed quantity @xmath154 but has some distribution function @xmath167 ( that may be gaussian or may not ) , we use the probability law @xmath168 , with @xmath169 , to convolute the @xmath150-dependent @xmath157 number with @xmath170 : @xmath171 the assumption that @xmath172 without error can be translated to eq .",

    "one source of systematic uncertainties is often due to the input parameters involved in the theorical calculation ( @xmath174 , @xmath175 , ckm mixing angles , etc . ) , whose experimental values are given by a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is then likely that the distribution function @xmath167 ( where @xmath150 is also a function of its input parameters ) has a maximum at @xmath154 and falls quickly for increasing @xmath176 .",
    "this feature can be implemented in a simple way by choosing @xmath167 as gaussian , and we expect that the results are not very sensitive to the precise shape of the function @xmath167 .",
    "let us then assume that @xmath167 is a gaussian with mean @xmath154 and standard deviation @xmath177 .",
    "intuitively , we expect that if @xmath178 , eq .",

    "we apply this procedure to the example at the beginning of this appendix , with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the distribution of @xmath150 is gaussian , we obtain the much more reasonable result of @xmath192 .",
    "this number must be compared with @xmath193 , obtained without taking into account the theoretical error , _",
    "i. e. _ calculating naively @xmath194 .",
    "the use of the theoretical error in the statistical comparison mitigates the discrepancy and implements numerically , in a simple but effective way , what one would intuitively expect in this case .",
    "the result @xmath192 reflects the fact that the theoretical and experimental values can have a good agreement if @xmath150 is smaller than its predicted value @xmath195 but a bad one if @xmath150 is larger , what is also possible because the theoretical error is of either sign .",
