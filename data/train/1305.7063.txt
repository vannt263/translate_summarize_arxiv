    "reactive magnetron sputtering is a widely used technique to deposit many materials such as metals or oxides , carbides , and nitrides for a variety of applications ranging from hard coatings for tools , wear resistant coatings in the automotive industry or bio compatible layers for medical applications .",
    "the resulting film structure is mainly dominated by the dissipated energy per atom during the growth process , which can be controlled by the ion bombardment either by varying from a balanced to an unbalanced magnetron or by additional applying a bias at the substrate level .",
    "this control over film properties would be best for fully ionized plasmas , however , the required high powers imply a large thermal load on the targets . a decade ago , this dilemma has been resolved with the introduction of high power pulse magnetron sputtering ( hipims ) , where a short high power pulse generates an almost fully ionized plasma followed by a long off time ( duty cycle typically in the range of percent)@xcite .",
    "hipims plasma have also been employed to deposit compounds such as oxides , nitrides or carbides .",
    "these are produced by the addition of reactive components such as oxygen , nitrogen or methane to the argon sputter gas .",
    "the additional reactive gas molecules are dissociated in the plasma .",
    "together with the sputtered metal from the target , a compound is formed on the substrate .",
    "these reactive neutrals , however , may also react with the metal target .",
    "this has drastic consequences for the process , because the sputter yield at the target depends sensitively on the surface composition having usually much smaller sputter yield for the poisoned target surface . as a consequence ,",
    "the growth rate decreases drastically and the system turns into its poisoned status @xcite . by a proper feedback control of the plasma process",
    "this can be adjusted .",
    "the need for feedback control is apparently very much reduced for hipims processes compared to dcms processes .",
    "this has been attributed either to the sputter wind emerging from the target , which results in gas rarefaction and a corresponding lower flux of reactive neutrals towards the target @xcite or to the intense sputtering of any compound at the target due to the high voltages of a hipims process @xcite .",
    "+ these effects and the interplay between working gas , reactive gas and target surface might better be understood , when the growth processes during a single hipims pulse can be temporally resolved .",
    "film growth in hipims plasmas is an inherent pulsed process with typical pulse lengths between 50 @xmath0s to 200 @xmath0s . during a hipims pulse current and voltages are constantly changing , reaching peak powers from @xmath1  kw/@xmath2 .",
    "these iv - characteristics give insight in the state of the plasma allowing the discrimination of five distinct phases @xcite .",
    "particle fluxes per pulse are in the order of 10@xmath3  @xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "this means that only 10@xmath6 monolayers are deposited per discharge .",
    "furthermore , the growth rate is not constant during a pulse but changing with the metalicity of the plasma .",
    "it is therefore almost impossible to directly measure the varying growth rate during a single pulse by methods like ellipsometry or quartz microbalances in the environment of an hipims plasma reactor .",
    "recently , we succeeded in devising a method to measure film growth during a hipims plasma pulse using a rotating shutter in front of a substrate to spread the temporal development of the plasma pulse on a lateral scale on a substrate @xcite . by using that method , the individual growth processes during titanium sputtering",
    "have been resolved @xcite .",
    "the individual phases as described by gudmundsson et al .",
    "@xcite could be clearly identified from ignition , current rise , gas rarefaction , plateau and afterglow . in this paper",
    "we develop this method further by combining it with an x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) analysis of the deposition profiles .",
    "thereby , the growth rate can be temporally separated into a metal part and a compound part .",
    "the rotating shutter experiments are performed in a vacuum vessel housing a 2 inch magnetron with a titanium target , which is powered by a melec hipims power supply .",
    "the substrate consists of a silicon wafer , which is inserted into a 6 inch substrate holder using a load lock system .",
    "argon gas is used as plasma forming gas at a pressure of 0.25  pa .",
    "a constant hipims pulse length of 200  @xmath0s and a duty cycle of 6@xmath7 is applied to the target .",
    "the average power is adjusted to @xmath8 40  w , while the peak power goes up to 0.75  kw .",
    "current and voltage at the target are monitored with a vi - probe .",
    "the vi - probe consists of a lem la305-s current transducer with a response time @xmath9",
    "@xmath0s and a d@xmath10d@xmath11100  a/@xmath0s and a lem cv3 - 1500 voltage transducer with @xmath12  @xmath0s and d@xmath13d@xmath14900  v/@xmath0s .",
    "the measurements are taken directly at the output of the hipims power supply .",
    "+ nitrogen is used as reactive gas for all experiments .",
    "a control of the hysteresis effect is performed by an active control system for the nitrogen flux .",
    "this system monitors the intensity of the titanium line at 307  nm ( 3d@xmath154p @xmath16 3d@xmath154s ) .",
    "the intensity of this line is damped with increasing nitrogen concentration .",
    "it is therefore used as actuating variable to regulate the reactive gas influx .",
    "the optical emission of the hipims - plasma is monitored by a hamamatsu rca 78- 09 ip28 photomultiplier .",
    "the photomultiplier is directed towards the center between the magnetron and the substrate . an optical filter with a center wavelength of 307@xmath17  nm and a full width half maximum of 10@xmath17  nm",
    "is placed in front of the photomultiplier in order to isolate the titanium line of interest .",
    "the signal of the photomultipler is processed by an analog integrator and an amplifier followed by an analog to digital converter .",
    "this signal is the input parameter for a software pid - controller which then regulates the reactive gas influx via a fast - acting pfeiffer rme 005 a valve . in all experiments ,",
    "the emission intensity was kept at @xmath18 of the maximum emission intensity for the whole deposition time .",
    "+ in front of the substrate , a rotating shutter is placed to measure the growth flux on the substrate . according to that concept a 200  @xmath0 m slit",
    "is rotated in front of the substrate synchronous with the hipims pulses .",

    "in this study the deposition time was six hours .",
    "after deposition , the substrates are extracted and the film deposition profiles on the wafers are measured using profilometry .",
    "profilometry is most exact , if a step edge between substrate and film can be measured .",
    "such a step edge is generated by placing at first a vacuum tape on the substrate .",
    "after deposition , this vacuum tape is removed leaving a sharp edge behind , which is evaluated using profilometry with an accuracy of @xmath19 10 nm . + by using an experiment with a stopped shutter ,",
    "the minimum spread of the deposition profile is measured , which can be converted into a minimum temporal resolution of 25 @xmath0s for the shutter rotating at 30 hz .",
    "details of this calibration can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the composition of the deposition profiles is ex - situ measured by xps .",
    "these measurements are performed in a versaprobe spectrometer from physical electronics , using monochromatic al k@xmath20 radiation at 1486.6  ev and a pass energy of 23.5  ev , which results in a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.58  ev for the ag3d@xmath21 core level of a clean silver sample .",

    "the surface of the sample is not neutralised .",
    "it is expected that the samples show good conductivity .",
    "further , the relative position of photoelectron lines is independent of the sample composition .",
    "the take - off angle between sample surface and analyzer level is 45@xmath23 .",
    "measurements are done parallel to the deposition profile , where in a first step a survey spectrum was taken every 1  mm .",
    "markings on the silicon wafer serve as a reference position for xps and profilometry . the n1s photoelectron line is used to define the measurement spots for a more detailed investigation . in regions ,",
    "in which n1s is observed , the distance between two measurement spots is chosen as 200  @xmath0 m , while it is 1000  @xmath0 m for the outer parts where no nitrogen is found . using the multipak software , the ratios of n1s , o1s and ti2p",
    "are determined by weighting the data with with their individual sensitivity factors .",
    "these composition profiles can be used to decompose the deposition profile , obtained by profilometry , into its individual components .",

    "the deposition rate follows these phases in a characteristic manner . at first , the plasma starts ( phase 1 ) , the current rises steeply ( phase 2 ) and finally goes through a maximum and declines again ( phase 3 ) . at the same time , the growth rate increases only slowly in phase 2 . a strong increase of the growth rate is observed in phase 3 followed by a saturation at a constant value ( phase 4 ) .",
    "after the end of the pulse , the growth rate decreases sharply with a time constant to the order of 100 @xmath0s followed by a tail with a slower decay constant ( phase 5 ) .",

    "the numbers indicate different phases of the growth process . for details",
    ", width=377 ]    this temporal evolution of the growth rate can now be separated into the contribution of titanium and nitrogen in the film by measuring along the deposition profile with xps .",
    "[ figure2]a shows the corresponding concentrations in at.@xmath7 of titanium , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "the surface oxygen is assumed to result from post - oxidation in the ambient atmosphere due to the ex - situ xps analysis .",
    "the oxygen concentration is the highest in regions with an excess of titanium in comparison to nitrogen .",
    "apparently , non stoichiometric tin parts of the deposition profile are oxidized ex - situ after contact with ambient air .",
    "consequently , we discuss in the following only the ratio between titanium and nitrogen as it is directly created in - situ during the hipims pulse .",
    "+ one observation is that the titanium and the nitrogen profile do not exhibit the same shape . at the beginning and at the end of the deposition profile ,",
    "the surface is titanium - rich with a very low concentration of nitrogen . such a behavior may be consistent with the gas dynamics in a hipims pulse :    * _ begin of the hipims pulse _ : at the beginning of the plasma in phase 1 and 2 , a strong gas rarefaction sets in , because the sputtering wind expels the neutral reactive gas in front of the target @xcite . consequently , the flux of titanium is high and that of nitrogen low . later in the pulse ,",
    "the fluxes of titanium and nitrogen come to an equilibrium after the initial current peak goes into the plateau phase 4 and the nitrogen uptake of the surface can take place . *",
    "_ end of the hipims pulse _ : at the end of the pulse , the nitrogen concentration drops much sharper than the titanium concentration .",
    "one may speculate that the incorporation of nitrogen into the layers is dominated by incident nitrogen ions rather than neutrals , because only ions disappear on a short time scale of the order of 100 @xmath0s .",
    "a low sticking coefficient for incident nitrogen atoms is a reasonable assumption .",
    "it is important to note that the deposited atoms before and after the hipims pulse constitutes only to a small fraction to the total amount of deposited material .",
    "nevertheless , it indicates that the hipims process is a sequential process where a titanium rich layer is followed by a tin layer . if one regards the total fluxes per pulse , lasting 200  @xmath0s and regarding a growth flux of the order of 10@xmath3  @xmath4s@xmath5 , a fluence per pulse of only @xmath28  @xmath4 is accumulated during each pulse .",
    "this is only a small fraction of a monolayer and any structural consequences from the layer - by - layer growth mode for the deposited tin films is not expected .",
    "however , the electronic structure of the surface might still be affected by even a small contribution of the sequential growth mode , since the work function might be altered even by small concentrations .",
    "the deposition profiles are further analysed for pressures of 0.25 , 0.5 and 1  pa , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "all experiments are performed at an average power of @xmath29  w , a pulse width of 200  @xmath30 and a duty cycle of 6@xmath7 .",
