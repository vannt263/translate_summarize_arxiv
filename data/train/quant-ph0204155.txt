    "contemporary considerations of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite correlations are restricted mostly to observers staying in a fixed inertial frame of reference ( for the theoretical prescriptions and experimental results see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this is motivated not only by the experimental requirement but , first of all , because of very serious difficulties connected with description of epr - like experiments in frames in a relative motion .",
    "there are two reasons of the troubles with understanding and calculating the epr correlation function in this case . the first one is related to the relativity of the notion of simultaneity for moving observers versus instantaneous state reduction .",
    "the second problem is related to the nonexistence of a covariant notion of localization in the relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the latter deficiency is especially serious because every realistic measurement involves localization in the detector area .",
    "proposed solutions to these problems strongly depend on the adopted interpretation of quantum mechanics . from an orthodox point of view ,",
    "attribution of physical meaning to the final probabilities only does not lead to a serious tension between quantum mechanics ( qm ) and special relativity , so they can `` peacefully coexist '' @xcite .",
    "the second line of understanding of qm lies in attributing a physical meaning to the physical state , its time evolution , localization , etc . from this point of view",
    "there are serious problems on the border between quantum mechanics and special relativity @xcite .",
    "the most important ones are : lack of the manifest lorentz covariance of quantum mechanics with finite degrees of freedom and the above mentioned nonexistence of a covariant notion of localization .",
    "troubles with a sharp localization in the relativistic qm arise also if we restrict ourselves to a fixed inertial frame ( cf",
    ".  hegerfeld theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "following bell @xcite , a consistent formulation of quantum mechanics requires a preferred frame ( pf ) at the fundamental level ( it is interesting that also einstein and dirac had admitted such a `` nonmechanical '' notion of a preferred frame @xcite ) .",
    "bell gives the very clear point of view on to this question in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a conceptual difficulty related to the notion of the pf lies in an apparent contradiction with the lorentz symmetry . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this is not the case : it is possible to arrange lorentz group transformations in such a way that the lorentz covariance survives while the relativity principle ( democracy between inertial frames ) is broken on the quantum level .",
    "moreover , such an approach is consistent with all the classical phenomena .",
    "the physical meaning of the new form of the lorentz group transformations lies in new , absolute synchronization scheme for clocks different from einstein s scheme @xcite .",
    "both synchronizations , the new and the standard one , are physically inequivalent on the classical level only for velocities greater than the velocity of light .",
    "furthermore , the causality notion , which is implied by the nonstandard absolute synchronization , is more general than the einstein one and thus it is applicable to nonlocal phenomena .",
    "a lorentz - covariant formulation of qm based on the above mentioned absolute synchronization scheme was given in @xcite .",
    "in such a formalism it is possible to define the lorentz covariant notion of localization and spin , i.e. , covariant localized states and a covariant position operator as well as the spin operator transforming properly under the action of the lorentz group .",
    "note , that exactly these notions are relevant to a correct discussion of ( non ) locality in qm .",
    "a serious candidate for a pf is the cosmic background radiation frame ( cbrf ) ; this choice is connected with possible dynamical ( cosmological ) distinguishing of a local privileged frame .",
    "most recent epr experiments performed in geneva @xcite have been analyzed according to pf hypothesis @xcite and give a lower bound for the speed of `` quantum information '' in cbrf at @xmath0 .",
    "moreover some attention was also devoted to pf as a consequence of a possible breaking of the lorentz invariance @xcite in high - energy processes .",
    "since the covariant spin operator also exists in the formulation of qm based on the absolute synchronization scheme @xcite , therefore we can calculate precisely the epr correlation function for any spin . to our knowledge ,",
    "our results are the first exact epr correlation functions obtained for lorentz - covariant quantum - mechanical systems in moving frames under physically acceptable conditions ( some attempts were given in interesting papers by czachor @xcite ; see however ref .  , where @xmath1 is pauli  lubanski four - vector , was calculated .",
    "however , in our opinion , this average can not be treated as a correlation function of spin measurements in the relativistic case because the spatial part of @xmath1 is not the spin operator in qm ( @xmath2 belongs to the enveloping algebra of lie algebra of poincar group , while the spin operator is a generator of the intrinsic rotations  see , e.g. , ref .",
    "moreover , the derivation of correlation function in refs .",
    "@xcite does not involve localization of measured particles in detectors and is restricted to the measurements performed in the same inertial frames . ] ) .",
    "because the resulting formula for the correlation function depends on the velocities of the preferred frame it can also help us to answer the old question concerning the existence of a pf by means of the quantum mechanical epr experiment and possibly solve the dilemma posed by bell .",
    "in this section we briefly describe main features of the absolute synchronization scheme mentioned above which is used in this work .",
    "the derivation of the presented results can be found in refs .",
    "the main idea is based on a well - known fact that the definition of time coordinate depends on the procedure used to synchronize clocks @xcite .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the timelike or lightlike signal propagation , the choice of this procedure is a convention @xcite .",
    "now , the form of lorentz transformations depends on the synchronization scheme , and we can find a synchronization procedure which leads to the desired form of lorentz transformation preserving instant time ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) hyperplanes . to perform such a program one has to distinguish an inertial frame , called the preferred frame : every absolute synchronization scheme ( ass ) distinguishes formally such a priviledged inertial frame .",
    "we can go from one ass to another by the action of the so - called synchronization group @xcite .",
    "the classical relativity principle can be formulated in this language as the invariance of physical laws under the action of the synchronization group , or more simply , by the statement that each inertial frame can be chosen as the preferred frame , i.e. , the choice of the preferred frame is physically irrelevant .",
    "the very serious advantage of ass is the separation of the two fundamental notions of special relativity , namely , the relativity principle and the lorentz covariance . in the absolute synchronization scheme , even in the case if the relativity principle is broken , the lorentz symmetry survives .",
    "now , each inertial frame is determined by its four - velocity with respect to the preferred one .",
    "we shall denote the four - velocity of the preferred frame as seen by an observer at rest in an inertial frame by @xmath4 .    according to refs .",
    "@xcite the transformation of the coordinates between inertial frames @xmath5 and @xmath6 takes the following form :    [ eq:1 ] @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an element of the lorentz group , @xmath9 is the four - velocity of the preferred frame with respect to @xmath5 , and @xmath10 is a @xmath11 matrix depending on @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this equation must be accompanied by the transformation law for the four - velocity of a preferred frame , which [ according to eq .  ]",
    "takes the form @xmath12    we point out that both eqs .",
    "are written for contravariant components of coordinate and four - velocity .",
    "the explicit form of the matrix @xmath10 is ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , for rotations    [ eq:2 ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a standard rotation matrix , and for boosts , @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes a four - velocity of the frame @xmath6 as seen by the observer in the frame @xmath5 .",
    "hereafter we use the natural system of units with @xmath17 .",
    "transformations leave the line element @xmath18 invariant , where @xmath19 = \\left (      \\begin{array}{c|c }        1 & u^0 { \\mathbf{u}}^t\\\\        \\hline        u^0 { \\mathbf{u } } & -i + ( u^0)^2 { \\mathbf{u } } \\otimes { \\mathbf{u}}^t      \\end{array }    \\right).\\ ] ] notice that @xmath20 is constant ( i.e. , @xmath21 independent ) in each inertial frame and is congruent to the minkowskian metric @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to check that the space element is euclidean , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the four - velocities @xmath9 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are related by @xmath26    the relation between coordinates in the standard and the absolute synchronization is given by    [ eq:4 ] @xmath27    where the subscript @xmath28 indicates coordinates in the standard ( einstein s ) synchronization , while the coordinates in the absolute synchronization are written without any subscript .",
    "we see that only the time coordinate changes .",
    "note also that in the same point of space we have @xmath29 , so the time lapse is the same in both synchronizations .",
    "the coordinates @xmath30 in the einstein s synchronization transform according to the standard law , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to stress that the transformations form a realization of the lorentz group which transforms linearly space - time coordinates according to eq .   and",
    "simultaneously , nonlinearly transforms the pf four - velocity according to .",
    "the round - trip velocity of light is invariant under eqs .  .",
    "in particular , the reichenbach synchronization coefficient @xcite is given by @xmath32 . moreover , from eqs .",
    "we have the following relation between velocities in the absolute and the standard synchronizations :    [ eq:5 ] @xmath33 @xmath34    notice that for @xmath35 the above formulas have singularities , i.e. , if a superluminal propagation ( possibly related to the nonlocality of the theory ) takes place then both descriptions are no longer equivalent and consequently an ass is physically distinguished in such a case even on the classical level @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the velocity manifold of spacelike particles is a proper carrier space for the lorentz group only in an ass @xcite .",
    "we point out that the triangular form of a boost matrix implies that under lorentz transformations the time coordinate is only rescaled by a positive factor , i.e. , @xmath36 , so the time ordering of events can not be inverted by any lorentz transformations between inertial frames , regardless of the space - time separation .",
    "this is important in the qm context because the transformations of time do not involve position operators .",
    "the lorentz - covariant qm was discussed in the framework of an absolute synchronization scheme in ref .",
    "we associate with each inertial observer in @xmath5 a hilbert space @xmath37 , so we have a bundle of hilbert spaces rather than a single hilbert space of states .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can introduce hermitian momentum and coordinate four - vector operators satisfying    [ eq:6 ] @xmath38       & = i \\left(\\frac{u_\\nu \\hat{p}^\\mu(u)}{u_\\lambda   \\hat{p}^\\lambda(u ) } - \\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\right),\\\\ { }      \\label{eq:6b }      [ \\hat{p}_\\mu(u ) , \\hat{p}_\\nu(u ) ] & = 0,\\\\      \\label{eq:6c }      [ \\hat{x}^\\mu(u ) , \\hat{x}^\\nu(u ) ] & = 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that @xmath39 commutes with all the observables .",
    "this allows us to interpret @xmath39 as a parameter just like in the standard nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "we stress that the commutation relations are _ covariant _ in the absolute synchronization .",
    "in fact , we have the following transformation law for four - vector operators    [ eq:7 ] @xmath44^\\mu{}_\\nu \\hat{x}^\\nu(u'),\\\\      \\label{eq:7b }      u(\\lambda ) \\hat{p}_\\mu(u ) u^{\\dag}(\\lambda ) & = [ d^t(\\lambda , u)]_\\mu{}^\\nu \\hat{p}_\\nu(u ' ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 and @xmath10 is given by eqs .  .",
    "using eqs .",
    "we can transform eqs .   to another reference frame .",
    "we point out once again that under transformations for the time component @xmath39 does not mix with spatial components @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "one can also check that @xmath48 = [ \\hat{p}_\\mu(u ) , \\hat{p}^2(u ) ] = 0,\\ ] ] which means that a localized state has a definite mass .",
    "it is important to stress that the unitary map which connects one choice of ass to another choice of ass and preserves eqs .   and   does not exist ( this means that the synchronization group @xcite can not be unitarily realized in this case ) .",
    "for this reason qm distinguishes an ass , i.e. , a particular preferred frame  the quantum preferred frame . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the choice of the quantum preferred frame can be done by the spontaneous breaking of the synchronization group . as it was mentioned earlier ,",
    "a natural candidate for quantum preferred frame is the cbrf .",
    "transformations of the lorentz group induce an orbit in a bundle of hilbert spaces @xmath37 .",
    "unitary orbits are parameterized by mass and spin , similarly as for standard unitary representations of the poincar group .",
    "an orbit induced by an action of the operator @xmath49 in the bundle of hilbert spaces under consideration is fixed by the following covariant conditions : ( i ) @xmath50 , ( ii ) @xmath51 is invariant ; for physical representations @xmath52 , @xmath53 . as a consequence there exists a positive defined lorentz - invariant measure @xmath54 now , applying the wigner method and using eqs",

    "@xmath68 is a wigner rotation belonging to the little group of a vector @xmath69 .",
    "it should be noted that in this approach , contrary to the standard one , representations of the poincar group are induced from the little group of the vector @xmath69 , and not @xmath70 .",

    "now , unlike in the standard epr experiments , we should not measure the dependence of the correlation function on the angle between the vectors @xmath124 and @xmath125 , but rather its dependence on the change of the velocities of pf , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , caused by the movement of the earth .",
    "finally we consider the case when velocities of the preferred frame are high . denoting @xmath226 , @xmath227",

    "we would like to point out that our results are the exact epr correlation functions obtained for lorentz - covariant quantum mechanical systems in moving frames under physically acceptable conditions , i.e. , taking into account the localization of the particles during the detection and using the spin operator with proper transformation properties under the action of the lorentz group .",
    "we applied the general result to the case of simultaneous measurements of the spin component for bipartite spin-1/2 system done by the spatially bounded detectors .",
    "the resulting correlation function is proportional to @xmath234 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the direction vectors and @xmath235 is the wigner rotation matrix associated with the lorentz transformation @xmath8 connecting the frames of the detectors .",
    "next we have studied the limiting cases of this particular correlation function and have shown that in the case when both measurements are performed in the same inertial frame we obtain the standard nonrelativistic result that the correlation function is proportional to the scalar product of the direction vectors .",
    "this result also holds if one of the measurements is performed in the preferred frame .",
    "we have also found the limit of the correlation function for small velocities and shown that it leads to the correction of the second order in velocities to the standard @xmath236 relation . on the other hand , the correlation function for the very high velocities of the pf with respect to the observers depends only on the directions of movement of the pf .",
    "it is important to stress that the exact epr correlation function   depends on the pf velocity in an essential way , i.e. , this dependence can not be removed by expressing the correlation function by classical quantities ( velocities ) given in the einstein s synchronization scheme .",
    "this means that _ the lorentz - covariant quantum mechanics must distinguish a preferred frame_. the above results can be used to propose a realistic experiment which can answer the question of the existence of quantum - mechanical preferred frame ( and its possible identification with the cbrf ) .",
