    "the experimental platform for the simulation of the majorana equation consists of two binary waveguide lattices , which only differ in the ordering of the two sites a and b forming a unit cell ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",

    "discrete setting , each spinor amplitude @xmath47 in unit cell @xmath48 of the upper plane has its counterpart @xmath49 in the lower plane .",
    "the evolution is terminated by a fan - out section of length @xmath50 , in which the waveguide separation is increased to some value @xmath51 at which no more significant evanescent coupling takes place .",
    "this fan - out trajectory follows a harmonic curve and @xmath50 is sufficiently long to ensure that bending losses are negligibly small . due to the gradual reduction of the coupling strength in this section , some residual evolution takes place , which effectively extends the evolution length to some value @xmath52@xcite .",
    "finally , all waveguide pairs of the two planes are mutually connected by vertical directional couplers of length @xmath53 . for balanced couplers@xcite ,",
    "the output amplitudes in the upper ports are proportional to the discrete majorana - spinor @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the desired recombination of the two spinors eq . is performed in an integrated and spatially resolved fashion .    in the experiments ,",

    "the vertical separation of the two planes ensures an effective decoupling everywhere , except at the directional couplers .",

    "<S> unphysical particles are commonly ruled out from the solution of physical equations , as they fundamentally can not exist in any real system and , hence , can not be examined experimentally in a direct fashion . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most celebrated equations that allows unphysical solutions is the relativistic majorana equation@xcite which might describe neutrinos and other exotic particles beyond the standard model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equation s physical solutions , the majorana fermions , are predicted to be their own anti - particles and as a consequence they have to be neutrally charged@xcite ; the charged version however ( called majoranon@xcite ) is , due to charge non - conservation , unphysical and can not exist . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> charge conservation violation has been contemplated in alternative theories associated with higher spacetime dimensions@xcite or a non - vanishing photon mass@xcite ; theories whose exotic nature makes experimental testing with current technology an impossible task . in our work , </S>",
    "<S> we present an experimental scheme based on optics with which we simulate the dynamics of a majoranon , involving the implementation of unphysical charge conjugation and complex conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the internal dynamics of the majoranon is fundamentally different from that of its close cousin , the dirac particle , to illustrate the nature of the unphysical operations . for this </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the fact that in quantum mechanics the wave function itself is not a measurable quantity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , wave functions of real physical particles , in our case dirac particles with opposite masses , can be superposed to a wave function of an unphysical particle , the majoranon . </S>",
    "<S> our results open a new front in the field of quantum simulations of exotic phenomena , with possible applications in condensed matter physics , topological quantum computing , and testing theories within and beyond the standard model with existing technology .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum simulators were originally proposed by richard feynman in 1982@xcite to tackle computational problems involving entanglement and the superposition principle in an efficient manner . instead of having a classical computer to enumerate quantum states ( a problem that remains very often intractable ) , he suggested using appropriate physical systems instead in order to reproduce the dynamics and quantum states of the problem under study in a controllable fashion . </S>",
    "<S> today , a wealth of simulation systems were successfully constructed using various architectures , such as atoms@xcite , trapped ions@xcite , superconducting circuits@xcite , photons and cavity qed set - ups@xcite . however , for most experimental implementations of simulators it is so far explicitly assumed that the problem under consideration is actually physical and that it can be written in hamiltonian form .    </S>",
    "<S> when ettore majorana wrote down his famous equation in 1937@xcite , he explicitly suggested describing the characteristics of neutrinos on its basis . </S>",
    "<S> he noted that lorentz invariance not only allowed the dirac equation , but also the expression ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 for the wave function @xmath2 of a particle with ( majorana ) mass @xmath3 and its charge conjugate @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the so - called majorana mass term points to violation of charge conservation , suggesting that a particle obeying the majorana equation must be its own anti - particle . for this physical reason , @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is commonly taken to be charge - neutral , i.e. , the majorana equation is frequently supplemented by the condition @xmath5 ( the resulting particle is called the majorana fermion ) . to date , no elementary particle has been identified as a majorana fermion . however , as majorana has originally envisioned , there is the possibility that the neutrino is a majorana fermion . in this case , the corresponding lepton number would not be conserved and the nature of the neutrino can therefore be tested by lepton number non - conserving processes such as neutrinoless double - beta decay@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of majorana fermion has also found use in condensed matter physics , where quasiparticle excitations can be their own antiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> these quasi - particles , which can be found in superconducting systems for example , form the basis for constructing non - abelian anyons that are useful for topological quantum computation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the charged version of a majorana fermion , the majoranon@xcite , violates charge - conservation may provide access to physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> in many theories , a potential violation of charge conservation , for example associated with higher spacetime dimensions@xcite or a non - vanishing photon mass@xcite , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , simulating unphysical effects may yield unexpected benefits in other areas , as recently shown for the case of complex conjugation that provides an efficient method to measure entanglement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of the majorana equation has been proposed for a trapped ion system@xcite , but no experimental data on the simulation of any unphysical particle has been reported so far , in any research field .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we break new grounds and devise an experimental scheme to simulate the dynamics of a majoranon , thereby implementing a simulator of an unphysical particle . to this end , we consider the majorana equation in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime , which reads for the two - component spinor @xmath6 as @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the momentum along the spatial coordinate and we have used the representation such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> one can not directly simulate this equation due to the fact that it contains a complex conjugation , which renders its hamiltonian formulation impossible@xcite . to circumvent this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we exploit the fact that the field @xmath2 can be decomposed into two independent complex fields @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being charge conjugation invariant : @xmath14@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these fields thus describe charge - neutral majorana fermions whose single particle dynamics are described by a pair of dirac equations , one with positive mass @xmath3 , and one with negative mass @xmath15 : @xmath16 importantly , the dirac equation itself is a physical equation and can be presented in hamiltonian form . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it can be simulated using various systems like trapped ions@xcite or light@xcite . physical operations in this decomposed hilbert space of two independent majorana fermions </S>",
    "<S> can be used to simulate unphysical operations acting on the majoranon such as as complex conjugation and charge conjugation to which that evolution is intrinsically linked by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1dmajorana ] ) . using a photonic chip set - up </S>",
    "<S> we implement the proposed decomposition and simulate the free evolution of a majoranon . on top of demonstrating the unphysical majoranon dynamics directly by measuring the absolute values of the spinor components </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the dynamics of a majoranon with its dirac cousin the same initial spinor following the dirac evolution . </S>",
    "<S> note that discrepancies between the two arise from the difference in the term proportional to the mass that renders the majorana equation unphysical . to further clarify this </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the quantity @xmath17 to illustrate these discrepancies@xcite . for a dirac particle at rest ( @xmath18 , or equivalently @xmath19 ) </S>",
    "<S> , it measures the population difference between the positive and negative energy branches and is a conserved quantity . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> it is not conserved for the majoranon at rest , but oscillates due to the unphysical mass term that continuously forces exchanges between the spinor components . borrowing from the physics of the dirac particle </S>",

    "<S> for a small effective evolution distance of @xmath37 ( see methods ) , the light mostly remains in odd waveguide sites , which heralds the prevalent occupation of @xmath33 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> note that the oscillations in pseudo - energy for the dirac particle and the majoranon occur for entirely different reasons : the oscillation for the dirac particle occurs due to non - zero momentum components in the initial wave packet , while the oscillation for the majoranon is mainly due to the unphysical mass term . to elaborate on this difference </S>",
    "<S> further , we also study the evolution of a majoranon for a larger mass . for this purpose , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath42 and @xmath43 lattice sites were used . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarised in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ resulthighmass ] . due to the reduced momentum contribution in the evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the oscillation in pseudo - energy has gotten smaller for the dirac particle , resulting in larger discrepancies with the majoranon , whose oscillation amplitude is not affected by the increase in mass ( see fig .  [ resulthighmass]g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation frequency , however , has increased , such that already at small distances @xmath44 mostly @xmath34 is populated ( see figs .  [ resulthighmass]a - c , e ) . after a distance of @xmath45 , </S>",
    "<S> a further oscillation period has occurred , leading again to a strong population of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transverse spreading of the wave packet is much less pronounced than for the smaller mass of @xmath22 , as clearly visible from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ resulthighmass]d , f . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that the amplitude of the _ zitterbewegung _ of @xmath13 decreases for larger masses , whereas the frequency is increased@xcite .        in our work </S>",
    "<S> , we observed the dynamics of a majoranon wave packet which involves charge conjugation and complex conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> simulating such unphysical operations provides an entirely new approach for probing and understanding exotic phenomena and particles that can not exist in nature , like the majoranon . </S>",
    "<S> our approach uses the fact that even for real particles the wave function itself is not a physical entity , but only its square modulus is . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the superposition of such wave functions can result in an unphysical phenomenon , which means , conversely , that the latter can be reproduced by simulating the individual wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> many interesting questions are prompted , concerning , e.g. , possible decay mechanisms of the majoranon , the impact of many - body effects and interactions , their scattering characteristics or possible applications in topological quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we anticipate that this first demonstration of unphysical operations in the laboratory will stimulate many exciting proposals that utilise the freedom of going beyond the ` physical ' operations in areas such as exotic particle physics and quantum information processing . </S>"
