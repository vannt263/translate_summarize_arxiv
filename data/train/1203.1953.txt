    "macromolecules such as dna and proteins carry an electrical charge in aqueous solution because of ionic dissociation of molecular groups on their surface .",
    "the amount and sign of the charge depends on various factors such as the ph of the solution .",
    "if an external electric field is applied , these macro - ions migrate along the field with a velocity that depends on its charge , size and shape as well as on the ionic composition of the background electrolyte .",
    "electrophoresis is a technique of analytical chemistry for separating a mixture of chemical compounds by exploiting their differing migration velocities in an applied electric field .",
    "it is a widely used laboratory technique in areas such as molecular biology , forensics and medicine .",
    "the most common format is `` gel electrophoresis , '' where the electrolyte is suspended in a porous gel .",
    "the technique of capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) has developed rapidly in recent years , partly because of the possibility of integrating ce channels on to micro - fluidic chips . in ce , the sample and suspending electrolyte are contained in a micro - fluidic channel with width in the range of tens of microns .",
    "ce can proceed in several modes , the simplest of which is `` zone electrophoresis '' . here a sample zone or band is injected into a micro - channel , which then moves by electrophoresis towards the detector at the opposite end under an applied electric field .",
    "different components arrive at different times and their arrival is marked by a peak in some solute property ( usually the uv absorbance ) at the detector window @xcite .",
    "the walls of the capillary , which are most commonly made of fused silica , has an electrostatic charge that is characterized by its zeta potential .",
    "therefore , the applied electric field results in an electro - osmotic flow along the capillary @xcite .",
    "this flow is normally advantageous in ce because it sweeps both positive and negative ions past a single detector near the outlet and also reduces the transit time from inlet to detector .",
    "however , it can , under certain circumstances adversely affect the separation by causing `` anomalous dispersion '' of the sample peak @xcite .",
    "the physical process of separation in ce is the result of the mutually opposed and competing processes of differential migration of ions and diffusive spreading along the axis of separation .",
    "the resolution depends on the strength of the applied electric field . in practice",
    ", the applied voltage is often very large , in the range of kilo volts .",
    "the highest voltage that can be applied is limited by the ability to dissipate the considerable joule heat that is produced in the buffer by the electrolytic current .",
    "this is the reason why the channel width may not exceed some tens of microns .",
    "it is clearly advantageous to have an electrolytic buffer of low conductivity in order to minimize heating .",
    "it is also advantageous to have a relatively high concentration of sample ions , since one of the limitations of ce is the high demand placed on the sensitivity of the detector , which must be sensitive to light attenuation over an optical path length of only a few tens of microns .",
    "however , the ratio of sample to background ion concentration can not be increased indefinitely ; distortions due to `` electromigration dispersion '' or the `` sample overloading effect '' limits the highest ratio of sample to background ion concentration that may be used in ce .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism of electromigration dispersion was elucidated by @xcite and may be roughly explained as follows : when the concentration of sample ions is comparable to that of the carrier electrolyte , the local electrical conductivity is altered in the vicinity of the sample peak . on the other hand , since the current through the capillary must be the same at all points along the axis , the electric field must change locally .",
    "this follows since the product of the conductivity and electric field is the current ( according to ohm s law , neglecting for the time being the diffusion current due to ionic concentration gradients ) .",
    "this varying electric field alters the effective migration speed of the sample ions , which , in turn , alters its concentration distribution .",
    "thus , we have a nonlinear transport problem that must be solved in a self consistent manner .",
    "electromigration dispersion causes highly asymmetric concentration profiles , high rates of dispersion and shock like structures that are reminiscent of nonlinear waves seen in many other physical systems .",
    "these effects have been widely reported in the literature on electrophoresis @xcite .",
    "simple one dimensional mathematical models of electromigration dispersion have been studied by @xcite by invoking the assumption of vanishing diffusivity which results in a single nonlinear hyperbolic equation for the concentration of sample ions .",
    "solutions describe the observed steepening of an intitially smooth profile leading to subsequent shock formation .",
    "two recent reviews by @xcite and @xcite provide more extensive references to this early work .",
    "the restriction of zero diffusivity was removed by @xcite ( henceforth referred to as gc ) who considered a three ion system  the sample ion , co - ion and counter - ion  where the diffusivities of the three ionic species were equal but not necessarily zero .",
    "the sample concentration was shown to obey a one dimensional nonlinear advection diffusion equation which reduced to burgers equation if the sample concentration was not too high relative to that of the background ions . since the initial value problem for burgers equation",
    "may be exactly solved , useful insight into the nature of electromigration dispersion could be gained in the limits of small as well as large pclet numbers .",
    "a generalization of this model to the situation where the buffer is a weak electrolyte has recently been presented  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the evolution of the peak shape may still be described by the burgers equation with a slight re - interpretation of a certain model parameter .",
    "if this parameter is taken as a fitting parameter , excellent quantitative agreement is obtained with measured values of the peak variance in experiments .",
    "a similar nonlinear advection diffusion equation was derived by @xcite in order to describe `` desalination shocks '' near constrictions in micro channels . however , in their problem the physical origin of the nonlinearity is related to surface conduction effects . in this paper",
    ", we extend the earlier work of gc by taking into account the fact that the channel wall generally has a non - zero zeta potential which creates a bulk fluid flow in the capillary due to electro - osmosis .",
    "the electro - osmotic flow affects the transport process in the following way : the axial variation of the electric field created by the conductivity changes results in a variable electro - osmotic slip velocity on the channel walls .",
    "this in turn results in an induced pressure gradient and the concomitant appearance of a shear in the velocity profile across the channel due to a well known mechanism @xcite .",
    "the shear then enhances axial dispersion due to the taylor - aris effect @xcite .",
    "our principal result is equation ( [ generalized_gc ] ) , which is a one dimensional nonlinear advection diffusion equation for the sample concentration averaged over the channel cross - section .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : formulation ] the complete mathematical statement of the flow and electro - diffusion problem is presented . in   [ sec : homogenized ] a systematic reduction of the full equations leading to equation  ( [ generalized_gc ] ) is achieved by introducing a number of physical approximations .",
    "the consequences of this equation are discussed in   [ sec : dispersion ] , where it is shown that there is a peak in the efficiency of separation at an intermediate value of the electro - osmotic flow strength .",
    "the broad implications of the analysis to separation efficiency in ce are discussed in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider ( see figure  1 ) a uniform , long capillary of arbitrary cross - sectional shape connected to infinite reservoirs at either end .",
    "the length of the capillary is much greater than the width ; the capillary may , for most purposes , be assumed infinitely long .",
    "the capillary contains a solute and @xmath0 strong ( i.e. completely dissociated ) electrolytes of concentration @xmath1 where @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "these concentrations then obey the conservation equations based on the nernst - planck model for ion flux  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the valence , mobility and diffusivity of species @xmath7 , the electronic charge is @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the electric potential and @xmath10 is the fluid flow velocity .",
    "the potential @xmath9 obeys the poisson equation ( in cgs units ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the permittivity of the solvent and @xmath13 is the density of free charges in the solvent .",
    "since the reynolds number is small for flow in micro - capillaries , the fluid flow is described by stokes equation @xmath14 together with the incompressibility constraint @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pressure and @xmath17 is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent .",
    "these equations are associated with a number of boundary conditions that describe our situation .",
    "the concentrations @xmath18 reduce to their equilibrium distributions in a uniform capillary very far away from the sample zone @xmath19 clearly @xmath20 when @xmath7 corresponds to the sample and is given by solutions of the two dimensional poisson - boltzmann model for the other species ( background electrolytes ) .",
    "the potential @xmath9 obeys dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the value of the potential at the wall , @xmath23 is the applied voltage , and , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the parts of the bounding surface of the capillary that correspond to the walls , the inlet and the outlet respectively ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the inlet and the outlet sections are separated by a distance @xmath27 and we are interested in the limit where @xmath23 and @xmath27 approach infinity but @xmath28 remains finite . the hydrodynamic flow satisfies the no - slip conditions at the wall @xmath29 and , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electro - osmotic flow in the uniform capillary when no sample is present , and , when @xmath27 is infinite",
    ". finally , the ion fluxes are zero at the capillary walls ( @xmath24 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit normal at the wall directed into the fluid .",
    "these equations and boundary conditions form a well posed system of equations that may be integrated numerically for given initial conditions .",
    "such a description would , however , be unnecessarily complex . our objective is to introduce a series of approximations that enable a reduced description in terms of a single one dimensional evolution equation for the cross - sectionally averaged concentrations @xmath34 , since this is the quantity that is essentially measured by the detector .",
    "henceforth , a bar above a field variable will always denote its average over the cross - section of the capillary .",
    "we now introduce a number of approximations that simplify the description and lead up to the one dimensional homogenized equation for the sample ion concentration that we seek .",
    "the developments closely follow gc except for the important difference that the possibility of a hydrodynamic flow field @xmath35 is admitted .",
    "the fixed charges on the wall are shielded by a cloud of counter - ions over a length scale of the order of the debye length ( @xmath36 ) which is related to the equilibrium ionic concentrations  @xcite .",
    "the debye length is typically of the order of nanometers ; much smaller than the characteristic width of the micro - channel which is in the range of tens of microns . under such conditions , the left hand side of ( [ poisson ] )",
    "may be set to zero  @xcite , and , as a consequence , the last term in ( [ stokes ] ) , representing the density of electric forces also vanish .",
    "electrical forces could also arise outside of debye layers in response to variations in electrical conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from such forces may however be neglected in the current context ( see supplementary material online ) .",
    "thus , poisson s equation is replaced by the constraint of local electro - neutrality .",
    "the loss of the equation for @xmath9 is however not catastrophic , because @xmath9 can be determined from the equation of current conservation @xmath37 where the current density @xmath38 is the sum of the ohmic conduction ( first term ) and a contribution due to differential diffusion ( second term ) .",
    "equation ( [ current_conserve ] ) follows from the constraint of local electro - neutrality on summing ( [ transport ] ) after multiplying by @xmath39 .",
    "the loss of the electrical forcing term in ( [ stokes ] ) is mitigated by replacing the no - slip boundary condition ( [ no - slip ] ) with the helmholtz - smoluchowski slip boundary condition  @xcite @xmath40 that takes into account the presence of a boundary layer of non - vanishing charge next to the capillary wall .",
    "here @xmath41 , the so called `` zeta - potential '' is the difference in the values of @xmath42 between a point at the outer edge of the debye layer and the corresponding point on the wall .",
    "it is a material property that will be assumed constant .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ dirichlet ] ) are replaced by @xmath43 which follows from ( [ zero_flux ] ) and is the condition of zero current flow into capillary walls . at large distances from the sample zone",
    "we have a uniform field ( @xmath44 ) and a uniform flow ( @xmath45 ) , thus , @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the unit vector in the axial direction .",
    "we introduce the kohlrausch @xcite function @xmath49 then ( [ transport ] ) together with the constraint of local electro - neutrality yields the following equation for @xmath50 : @xmath51 for a two ion system , equation  ( [ transport_k ] ) together with the condition of local electro - neutrality leads to the ohmic model  @xcite where the local electrical conductivity evolves as a passive scalar with an effective diffusivity @xmath52 ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes the diffusivities of the cation and anion . in our problem",
    ", we have more than two ionic species and the ohmic model is not applicable .",
    "however , if we assume that the ions all have the same mobilities , @xmath55 , and therefore , on account of the einstein relation @xmath56 , the same diffusivities , @xmath57 , then the function @xmath50 , rather than the conductivity , is found to evolve as a passive scalar : @xmath58 we restrict ourselves to a minimal model consisting of a system of just three ions ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we will drop the index @xmath7 and instead use the suffix @xmath16 and @xmath60 to denote the positive ion and negative ion respectively , in the background electrolyte .",
    "the absence of a suffix will indicate the sample ion .",
    "for example , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the concentrations of positive ions , negative ions and sample ions respectively .",
    "then from the local electro - neutrality constraint and the definition of @xmath50 we have @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the concentration of negative ions in the background electrolyte far from the sample zone . if @xmath67 denotes the value of @xmath50 in the far field , then the perturbation @xmath68 is advected by the flow and spreads diffusively from the injection region . therefore ( gc ) , after an initial transient that is small compared to the total analysis time , the sample peak , which moves by electrophoresis in addition to being advected by the flow , migrates into a region of space where @xmath69 is effectively zero .",
    "thus , in the vicinity of the sample peak , we may assume that @xmath70 , so that , the background ion concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 may be expressed as linear functions of the sample ion concentration @xmath63 .",
    "the diffusion current represented by the second term in ( [ je ] ) vanishes when @xmath57 on account of local electro - neutrality , so that it reduces to ohm s law for a homogeneous electrolyte : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the local electrolyte conductivity .",

    "@xmath73 is the bulk electrolyte conductivity , @xmath74 is the sample concentration relative to the background and @xmath75 is the parameter @xmath76 introduced in gc to characterize the nature of the nonlinearity .",
    "the subsequent development is based on the premise of `` slow axial variations '' on account of the inlet to detector separation , @xmath27 , being much larger than the characteristic channel width , @xmath77 . in practice",
    ", @xmath27 is of the order of tens of cm whereas @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 . therefore , as the sample moves down the micro - channel , the sample concentration and all other quantities controlled by this concentration vary on an axial length scale @xmath81 . to see this , suppose that the initial sample concentration was a delta function in the axial direction .",
    "then it would spread over a distance of the order of the channel width in time @xmath82 .",

    "thus , the field is predominantly in the axial direction and depends on the local sample concentration .",
    "the axial variability of the electric field affects the evolution of the sample concentration in two ways .",
    "first , it results in a variable electrophoretic migration velocity @xmath92 for the sample ions , where @xmath93 is the migration velocity of an isolated sample ion .",
    "second , it results in a variable slip velocity for the electro - osmotic flow through the boundary condition ( [ hs - slip ] ) .    the hydrodynamic flow field due to such a variable slip velocity",
    "may be written down using lubrication theory  @xcite .",
    "the velocity is predominantly in the axial direction , @xmath94 and the axial component @xmath95 may be written as the sum of a mean @xmath96 and a fluctuation about the mean , @xmath97 , due to the induced pressure gradient .",
    "the mean flow @xmath96 is a constant given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the slip velocity at the wall . in the presence of concentration gradients , the slip velocity could also have a diffusiophoretic component  @xcite .",

    "lateral inhomogeneities in the scalar concentration are small @xmath106 , so that the cross - sectionally averaged concentration @xmath107 is advected by the mean flow @xmath108 and undergoes axial diffusion with an effective diffusivity  @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 and the conditions @xmath112 to remove the indeterminacy of @xmath110 up to a constant , we further impose the condition @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , the sample ions are advected with a concentration dependent velocity @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the equation satisfied by @xmath114 is @xmath115 =   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left [    \\left\\ {   d + \\frac{k u_{eo}^{2 } w_{0}^{2}}{d } \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha \\bar{\\phi } } { 1 - \\alpha \\bar{\\phi } } \\right)^{2 }   \\right\\ }   \\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\phi } } { \\partial x }   \\right ]    \\label{generalized_gc}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is a numerical constant depending solely on the cross - sectional shape and @xmath77 is a characteristic channel width .",

    "the physical reason for the breakdown of ( [ generalized_gc ] ) when @xmath132 is the following : under those conditions the conductivity in the sample zone is so high as to reduce the electric field to very small values",
    ". then the electrophoretic motion of the sample ions become very small and there is little relative motion between the sample peak and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the assumption that @xmath69 may be set to zero in the sample zone can no longer be employed and ( [ generalized_gc ] ) is no longer valid . however , after sufficient time has passed and axial diffusion has caused the peak value of @xmath114 to fall below @xmath133 , the time evolution once again proceeds in accordance with ( [ generalized_gc ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the full electrohydrodynamic equations described in ",
    "[ ssec : tdl ] confirm this behavior ( chen & ghosal , unpublished ) .",
    "for the purpose of numerical integration , ( [ generalized_weak_gc ] ) is a little more convenient than ( [ generalized_gc ] ) since it does not exhibit the singularity at @xmath134 .",
    "nevertheless , even though solutions to ( [ generalized_weak_gc ] ) may be formally calculated even for @xmath135 , the solution in this regime is devoid of physical significance , and indeed , will yield negative concentrations of background electrolytes in parts of the domain if ( [ cn ] ) and ( [ cp ] ) with @xmath136 are employed to calculate the concentrations of the background ions .",
    "equation ( [ generalized_gc ] ) or ( [ generalized_weak_gc ] ) provide a compact description of electromigration dispersion that is helpful for gaining a qualitative understanding of the underlying mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , it is much more amenable to numerical integration than the full three dimensional coupled problem involving fluid flow and transport . by way of example , in this section , we use numerical integration to illustrate a point that at first sight may appear counter - intuitive , but , is clarified by an analysis of ( [ generalized_gc ] ) .",
    "since the presence of a zeta - potential results in cross - channel variations in the flow velocity due to induced pressure gradients , one would expect the efficiency of separation to be adversely affected .",
    "however , in certain ranges of parameters the reverse may actually be true . to understand this",
    ", one needs to examine the roles of the different terms in ( [ generalized_weak_gc ] ) . the nonlinear term on the left hand side causes wave steepening leading to the formation of shock like structures .",
    "this is the dominant mechanism that contributes to electromigration dispersion ( gc ) .",
    "taylor dispersion can actually mitigate this tendency by increasing the effective axial diffusivity that serves to diffuse the electrokinetic shock .",
    "however , on the other hand , if the taylor dispersion is too large , its contribution to the axial dispersion dominates with a consequent loss of separation efficiency .",
    "thus , there is an intermediate value of the wall zeta potential that corresponds to the lowest peak dispersion .     as a function of dimensionless electro - osmotic velocity @xmath137 for three different detector to injection point distances ( @xmath27 ) and a range of sample loading characterized by the pclet number @xmath138 . here",

    "if the detector position is fixed , the peak reaches it faster for higher electro - osmotic flow speeds and the accumulated variance is less simply because the peak has evolved for a shorter time period .",
    "in fact , in the absence of the nonlinearities induced by electromigration dispersion , @xmath168 . in this ideal limit @xmath169 . in order to eliminate this obvious effect that electro - osmotic flow has on peak dispersion , we plot @xmath170 as a function of @xmath155 in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : n ] , which clearly shows , that the degradation of separation efficiency by electromigration dispersion is minimized at an intermediate value of the electro - osmotic flow @xmath155 . the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath27 at different values of @xmath167 is shown in figure  4 of the supplementary material included in the online version .     as a function of time of arrival ( @xmath171 ) at a fixed detector location ( @xmath160 ) for several values of electro - osmotic flow strength , @xmath162 . it is seen that though electro - osmotic flow improves the resolution , the degree of improvement `` saturates '' as the flow rate is increased , as one might expect from figure  [ fig : n ] .",

    "it is seen that the increase in the effective axial diffusivity due to taylor dispersion `` softens '' the electrokinetic shock that results from nonlinear wave steepening due to electromigration .",

    "the total dispersion is determined by the relative contribution of each of ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . at low values of @xmath155 , ( a ) and",
    "( b ) dominate , but at higher values , ( c ) is more important . in laboratory systems , @xmath155 could have either sign and a magnitude that could vary between zero ( e.g. in a coated capillary where electro - osmosis is suppressed ) to some number of order unity , since the electro - osmotic velocity is similar in magnitude to the electrophoretic velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : detector ] provides an alternate viewpoint that has a closer correspondence with experiments : the signal intensity @xmath172 is plotted as a function of the time of arrival at a fixed detector position at distance @xmath27 from the injection point .",
    "it is seen that introduction of an electro - osmotic flow at first results in a significant reduction in peak width , but with diminishing returns as the flow strength is increased .",
    "a similar plot is shown as figure  6 in the supplementary material except there @xmath150 is plotted as a function of @xmath173 at fixed times .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to make a few remarks about the relevance of the analysis presented here to laboratory practice . the model studied here is clearly oversimplified and ( [ generalized_gc ] )",
    "can not be expected to predict in detail the peak shapes in a real laboratory experiment . in particular ,",
    "real electrophoresis buffers contain many more than three ions including one or more weak acids or bases that are added to maintain a stable ph .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to understand the qualitative effects predicted by the simplified model considered here , since the actual dispersion in a real laboratory experiment is likely to be due to a multiplicity of causes , of which , the mechanism discussed here would be one .    in this paper , we have described the effects of electromigration dispersion by means of a small set of dimensionless parameters : the pclet numbers @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath75 , and , the dimensionless electro - osmotic flow speed @xmath162 .",
    "a rough idea of typical values of these parameters in laboratory experiments is helpful .",
    "if we take @xmath176 mm / s , @xmath177 , @xmath178 @xmath179/s as fairly typical , we have @xmath180 . for large molecules",
    ", @xmath181 could be an order of magnitude smaller , so that @xmath182 could be in the hundreds . if the sample concentration is of the same order as the background electrolyte concentration and the peak width is of the order of the channel width , then @xmath183 .",
    "however , such sample concentrations would be considered extremely high in ce and would show very strong peak distortion .",
    "we may therefore take this as an upper limit for @xmath184 .",
    "thus , @xmath167 could range from essentially zero ( the linear regime ) to @xmath185 . since electrophoresis and electro - osmosis are generally of comparable magnitudes , @xmath186 .",
    "thus , @xmath187 , though @xmath155 could be close to zero if the channel walls have a low zeta potential ( as in a coated capillary ) . the magnitude of the parameter @xmath75 is of order unity if the sample valence and the valence of the background electrolytes are similar .",
    "however , for macro - ions @xmath188 or larger . for such large value of @xmath189 , @xmath190 could be in the hundreds , and , nonlinear effects of the kind considered in this paper would be very pronounced .",
    "electro - osmotic flow is generally desirable in the context of ce as it shortens the transit time from inlet to detector and as a consequence also reduces the peak variance .",
    "the effect of electro - osmotic flow on separation efficiency is however complicated in the presence of electromigration dispersion since a number of competing effects are simultaneously present .",
    "this paper generalizes the analysis presented in an earlier paper ( gc ) where the effect of electromigration dispersion in the absence of any bulk flow was considered .",
    "however , capillary electrophoresis channels are usually made of fused silica which has a large negative zeta potential and sustains strong electro - osmotic flow .",
    "thus , the theory presented here broadens the scope of the earlier paper making it more relevant to practical systems .    in summary , a homogenized equation for the cross - sectionally averaged concentration of sample ions",
    "was derived by exploiting the approximations outlined in   [ sec : homogenized ] , which are : ( a ) the debye length is much smaller than the typical channel width ( b ) the electrolyte contains only three ionic species of equal diffusivity which are also strong electrolytes ( c ) the time between injection and detection is much longer than characteristic transport times across the capillary .",
    "the outcome of the analysis is the replacement of the molecular diffusion coefficient in the one dimensional transport equation derived in gc by an effective axial diffusivity which is a nonlinear function of the concentration .",
    "if the concentration is not too high , this effective diffusivity is a quadratic function of the concentration .",
    "the reduced one - dimensional equation ( [ generalized_gc ] ) provides a compact description of electromigration dispersion that is much more amenable to numerical integration than the full coupled three dimensional problem involving fluid flow and transport in the capillary .",
    "in fact , since both the length to width aspect ratio of the capillary as well as the pclet number ( @xmath182 ) are usually large in experiments , such three dimensional simulations can be computationally intensive .",
    "the loss of accuracy in replacing the full equations by the one dimensional model is minimal because the requirements for its validity are well satisfied and the asymptotic convergence of the thin debye layer and long length scale approximations have been shown to be rapid @xcite .",
    "the effect of a wall zeta potential may be explained qualitatively in the following way : alteration of the ionic composition of the solute in the sample zone results in a change of the electrical conductivity and therefore in the axial electric field .",
    "thus , the electro - osmotic slip velocity now has an axial variation which induces pressure gradients along the channel .",
    "this in turn induces shear in the electro - osmotic velocity profile .",
    "the consequent shear induced ( taylor - aris ) dispersion results in a concentration dependent axial diffusivity .",
    "numerical integration of the homogenized equation ( [ generalized_gc ] ) provided some qualitative insights into the effect of this nonlinear diffusion on separation efficiency .",
    "it is seen that the total variance for a fixed detector position actually decreases with the strength of the electro - osmotic flow as long as the flow is not too strong .",
    "this is due to the fact that an increase in the effective diffusivity for axial transport counteracts the wave steepening resulting from electromigration dispersion , and , furthermore , the transit time from injection to detection is reduced .",
    "however , if the flow is much stronger , the dispersion caused by the enhanced axial diffusivity itself is dominant , and this degrades any gain in resolution due to the aforemetioned causes .",
    "thus , if all other parameters are invariant , the peak variance is a non - monotonic function of the electro - osmotic flow strength and is optimal at a certain intermediate value of the flow velocity .",
