    "the radial motion of a test particle falling in a black hole is one of the key issues in general relativity .",
    "the infalling motion has been studied specifically for schwarzschild black hole by several authors ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "all of them reached the same conclusion that velocity of the infalling particle approaches that of light near the event horizon , which for the schwarzschild case is at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the observers , called static observers , are at rest with respect to the mass creating the gravitational field .",
    "they are actually the world lines on the hypersurface of orthogonal killing vector field for the metric describing the gravitational field .",
    "however there exists a common misconception that particle approaches the speed of light as it moves to the black hole horizon for all observers , but not as a limiting procedure for a static observer at @xmath2 as @xmath3 . however",
    "if we assume that the particle approaches the event horizon at the speed of light for a static observer , as we have defined it earlier , then simple velocity composition law tells that it should approach the speed of light for all local observers as space time is locally minkowskian .",
    "so we have to modify our notion of velocity for a test particle near a black hole for a static observer which was done for schwarzschild black hole ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the notion of observer is implemented and used in various co - ordinate frames by several authors ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however recently a progress has been made in obtaining trajectory around a general spherically symmetric non - rotating black hole by choosing a general metric ansatz @xcite ,    @xmath4    for this general case we find the velocity of the test particle with respect to a static observer ( @xmath5constant ) to be a function of @xmath6 .",
    "while for the case of a general observer such that both the observer and the test particle moves along geodesic in @xmath7 plane then the velocity of the test particle with respect to the observer to our surprise , do not depend on the choice of the function @xmath6 provided the particle has high energy which is the most common case for astrophysical bodies , however it depends on the angular momenta which was absent in earlier works @xcite .",
    "then we have used some classes of spherically symmetric solutions in alternative gravity theories to find the relative velocity of a test particle with respect to an observer .",
    "we have discussed spherically symmetric solution in string inspired dilaton model @xcite , and calculate motion of a test particle in this spacetime .",
    "secondly we have considered a spherically symmetric solution in quadratic gravity obtained in a recent paper @xcite to discuss the velocity profile of an object .",
    "finally we have discussed motion in spherically symmetric solutions in einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet(emgb ) theory and vacuum solution in @xmath8 gravity . throughout the paper",
    "we shall use natural unit such that @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in section ( @xmath10 ) we introduce the general idea of observer and co - ordinate frames which we shall use throughout this work . in section ( @xmath11 )",
    "we discuss the motion in spherical symmetric space - time for the general choice of metric as presented in equation ( @xmath12 ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss some classes of alternative gravity theories .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion on the results obtained .",
    "the mathematical beauty of general relativity is the freedom of choice of coordinates in the description of physical phenomenon .",
    "we could choose any co - ordinate system as we wish , this choice might be taken in favor of the symmetry involved in the problem . also the co - ordinates are not sufficient we need reference frame as well .",
    "however the co - ordinate system and reference frames are not independent , for example in one reference frame one set of co - ordinates may be important while it could change in other reference frame .",
    "however in literature @xcite it is often seen that co - ordinate system and reference frames are used interchangeably .",
    "however in our discussion we find the use of `` reference frame '' and `` co - ordinate system '' to be distinct .",
    "by reference frame we shall mean a set of observers to take measurements , for example the set of all observers moving in a time like geodesic form a reference frame , whereas co - ordinate system refer to numbers specified over the whole space time manifold .    in special relativity",
    "an infinite lattice work of sticks and clocks @xcite suffice to define a unique reference frame .",
    "however in general relativity we can not have such rigid framework since the space time is minkowskian only locally , so we replace this rigid system by a fluid @xcite . in a strictly mathematical sense the set of observers represents a set of future pointing time like congruence , which is a three parameter family of curves @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an affine parameter defined over the path , and @xmath15 labels the spatial parts of the curve .",
    "observer in general theory is very local and it is a material particle parameterized by proper time . an observer field i.e. its velocity field @xmath16 on the manifold @xmath1 is stationary provided there exist a smooth function @xmath17 greater than @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 is a killing vector field , so the lie derivative of the metric with respect to the vector field @xmath20 vanishes ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",
    "there is a natural way for an @xmath16-observer to define the speed of any particle with four velocity @xmath22 as it passes an event @xmath23 , then the observer measure the square of the speed at event @xmath24 to yield @xcite ,    @xmath25    then we have @xmath26 and as well as @xmath27 .",
    "thus the above relation can be simplified to yield ,    @xmath28    note that the two velocities @xmath29 and @xmath22 are time like as observer and the test particle are both time like .",
    "we shall assume that our test particle is confined to a plane which is generally chosen as @xmath30 for calculational simplicity and as well as we have spherical symmetry so if we discuss the situation for some specified @xmath31 plane then it would be the same for all .",
    "thus this no longer represent a radially ingoing particle but a more generalized case where the particle has two variables to specify namely , ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the motion is determined by the euler equations corresponding to the lagrangian formed as @xmath33 , which has the following explicit form ( using equation ( @xmath12 ) ) ,    @xmath34    where dot denotes differentiation with respect to proper time of the particle .",
    "this equation can be written in terms of the particle proper time and then along the orbit we have @xmath35 .",
    "this finally leads to ,    @xmath36\\ ] ]    where    @xmath37    this is the velocity of the particle with respect to a static observer ( r = constant ) as illustrated by plugging @xmath38 in equation ( [ i4 ] ) ; i.e. the particle moves through a distance @xmath39 in a proper time given by @xmath40 , where from now on we shall use simply @xmath17 for @xmath6 due to notational simplicity .",
    "since the lagrangian as given in ( @xmath41 ) do not contain @xmath42 explicitly we have a constant of motion which is nothing but the energy of the particle and it is given by ,    @xmath43    this constant of motion actually originates from the killing vector field @xmath44 , this can be phrased as , if the 4-velocity of the particle @xmath45 is a geodesic , then we have @xmath46 . from ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 )",
    "we have obtained ,    @xmath49    also the energy can be determined from the initial value of radius and velocity using ( @xmath50 ) such that , @xmath51 . where @xmath52 is the initial radial co - ordinate and @xmath53 is the initial velocity .",
    "we have another constant of motion in this case which corresponds to the angular momentum of the particle and could be given by ,    @xmath54    thus finally the velocity in proper frame on the plane @xmath55 is given by ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57=f\\left[1+\\frac{l^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right]$ ] .",
    "thus the 4-velocity components for the geodesic particle specified by energy and angular momentum is given by ,    @xmath58    written in terms of the constants of motion @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as a check we can use the identity @xmath61 . thus equation ( [ v8 ] ) represents the four velocity of a test particle in a space - time metric given by equation ( [ i1 ] ) .      in some cases",
    "the velocity is measured in terms of proper time , as determined by clocks synchronized along trajectory of the particle .",
    "the velocity in case of radial particle is given by @xcite ,    @xmath62    when we generalize this result to our case where we have three co - ordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( since @xmath65 ) , then velocity expression generalizes to ,    @xmath66    note that if we let @xmath67 to be zero , then it reduces to equation ( @xmath68 ) . in our case keeping the non zero terms",
    "we obtain ,    @xmath69    which is completely identical to ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this definition has co - ordinate invariance .",
    "the 4 velocity has components @xmath71 and that for the particle reduces to @xmath72 . thus using equation ( @xmath73 )",
    "we obtain the same equation as ( @xmath74 ) .    from equation ( @xmath50 )",
    "we see that as @xmath75 , the velocity is equal to 1 .",
    "hence for static observers @xmath76 approaches the speed of light at the event horizon and they predict faster than light speed inside event horizon .",
    "it might seem at first sight that this result has nothing to do with @xmath75 but is connected to the co - ordinate system .",
    "however it has nothing to do with co - ordinate system but with the observer .",
    "so we should generalize our observer set .",
    "also no observer can be at rest at @xmath0 except photon , with respect to photon all particle traverse at speed of light . to get a clear view we discuss the acceleration of a static observer in the field of the gravitating body .",
    "the acceleration is necessary as in general relativity an observer at rest is not geodesic and is accelerated .",
    "the four acceleration field is defined as ,    @xmath77    the only non zero component is given by using the definition of four velocities for static observers , @xmath78 to yield ,    @xmath79    so acceleration depends on the function @xmath6 .       with radial co - ordinate r for different choice of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83.[fig1],width=336,height=336 ]     with test particle energy for different observer energy and radial distance.[fig2],width=336,height=336 ]     with test particle angular momentum for different choices of test particle energy.[fig3],width=336,height=336 ]     with @xmath81 and r.[fig4],width=336,height=336 ]",
    "we consider motion of two particles such that the four velocities are given by ,    @xmath84    hence we obtain the following result ,    @xmath85    thus we obtain ,    @xmath86^{2}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    simplifying and rearranging terms we have obtained that ,    @xmath89^{2}\\ ] ]    we know that the relative velocity could be given by , @xmath90 . thus using equation ( @xmath91 ) and assuming that energy of both the particle and the observer are high enough or the distance is large enough we ultimately arrive at ,    @xmath92^{2}}\\ ] ]    note that as @xmath93 the velocity approaches that of light i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "however if the particle and the observer has the same impact parameter i.e. @xmath95 then even if @xmath93 the velocity does not approach @xmath96 , which is a very interesting result . also at short distance the velocities and hence energies are very high so @xmath97 and @xmath98 are small quantities , however at large distance not @xmath97 and @xmath98 but @xmath6 become smaller and thus as they appear in product form in the velocity expression it holds good for all @xmath2 .",
    "thus we can say that equation ( @xmath99 ) is a general result .",
    "this result is valid in spherically symmetric solutions for einstein gravity like the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions but also for the einstein - maxwell - gauss bonnet theory .",
    "there exists two additional well known spherically symmetric solution but they do not have the form used .",
    "so we shall consider them in the next two sections .",
    "note from figure-@xmath100 , as radial co - ordinate of the particle is decreased the velocity remain less than speed of light .",
    "as @xmath93 the velocity also approaches @xmath96 in our system of units , which is justified and shows the actual motion that happen as the particle moves within the event horizon .",
    "it is also clear that with increase of the energy of the particle the velocity increases and it also increases with increasing the angular momenta .    from figure-@xmath101",
    "we see that as energy of the particle is increased we get a interesting behavior , at first it decreases and become zero , then it again increases .",
    "thus here the combined quantity in the denominator becomes 4 .",
    "this happens when @xmath80 coincides with @xmath81 ( see the figure ) , as we have chosen @xmath102 ( see equation @xmath99 ) .",
    "however changing the radius has a very small effect on velocity profile .",
    "from figure-@xmath103 we find that velocity varies with angular momentum in some what the same manner as it does with energy .",
    "however by proper choice of @xmath104 the velocity can be made zero when @xmath105 as we have chosen other parameters such that @xmath106 , since under this condition the denominator in equation ( @xmath99 ) become @xmath107 . as well as we can eliminate that zero by changing @xmath81 .",
    "figure-@xmath108 shows the variation of velocity both with radial co - ordinate and the energy of the particle .",
    "this graph merely shows combined effects of varying radius and energy as we have illustrated in earlier graphs .",
    "current theoretical cosmology has two fundamental problems , namely inflation and late time acceleration of the universe . the usual scenarios used to explain both these accelerating cosmology epochs are to develop acceptable dark energy model , such as : scalar , spinor , cosmological constant and higher dimensions .",
    "even if such a scenario seems to be partially succesful it is hindered by the coupling with usual matter , compatibility with standard elementary particle theories .",
    "however another natural choice is the classical generalization of general relativity , called modified gravity or alternative gravity theory ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "thus a gravitational alternative to explain inflation and dark energy seems very reasonable on the ground of the expectation that general relativity is just an approaximation that is valid at small curvature .",
    "a sector of modified gravity containing the gravitational terms relevent at high energy produced the inflationary epoch . during evolution curvature decreases and general relativity describes to an good approaximation the intermediate universe . with a furthur decrease of curvature as sub - dominant terms",
    "grow we see a transition from deceleration to cosmic acceleration .",
    "there exists traditional @xmath8 , string inspired models , scalar tensor theory , gauss - bonnet theory and some other models . in the next subsections",
    "we shall discuss motion of a test particle and hence its velocity in four spherically symmetric solutions for different alternative gravity theories .",
    "static uncharged black hole in general relativity are described by schwarzschild solution .",
    "if mass of the black hole is much large compared to planck mass then this also , to a good approximation , describes the uncharged black hole in string theory except regions near singularity .",
    "however there was some departure from the schwarzschild scenario when an exact calculation is made @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss this solution later in this work .",
    "from now on we shall assume that the above assertion is correct .",
    "however for einstein - maxwell solutions the string inspired theory differ widely from the known classical solution i.e. the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "the dilaton coupling with @xmath109 implies that every solution with non zero @xmath110 will come with a non zero dilaton .",
    "thus the charged black hole solution in general relativity ( which is the reissner - nordstrm solution ) appears in a new form in string theory due to the presence of dilaton .",
    "the effective four dimensional low energy lagrangian obtained from string theory is ,    @xmath111\\ ] ]    where @xmath110 is the maxwell field associated with a @xmath112 subgroup of @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",
    "we have set the remaining gauge fields and antisymmetric tensor field @xmath115 to zero and @xmath116 is the dilaton field ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "extremizing with respect to the @xmath112 potential @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 leads to the following field equations ,    @xmath120    the static spherically symmetric solution corresponding to the above field equation ( [ n1 ] ) would give the following line element as , @xcite    @xmath121    where , @xmath122 . once again due to isometry",
    "we have taken our motion in the equatorial plane such that , @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 is the asymptotic value of dilaton and @xmath125 represents the black hole charge .",
    "note that this is almost identical to the schwarzschild metric , with a difference that areas of spheres of constant r and t now depend on q. in particular the surface @xmath126 is singular .",
    "also @xmath0 is the regular event horizon .",
    "also the evolution of the scalar field @xmath118 could be given by ,    @xmath127    we can define the dilaton charge as ,    @xmath128    where the integral is over a two sphere at spatial infinity and @xmath129 is the normal to the two sphere at spatial infinity . for charged black hole this leads to ,",
    "@xmath130    here d depends on the asymptotic value of dilaton field , which is determined once m and q are given and is always negative .",
    "note that the actual dependance on dilaton field is described by , @xmath131 .",
    "since we have walked in the unit @xmath132 we have the term modified to @xmath133 .",
    "so as @xmath134 , this term is expected to become significant .",
    "+ now we write the above metric in a generalized form , @xmath135    as usual we have @xmath136 and @xmath137 , however due to notational simplicity we have taken them to be simply @xmath17 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "then the velocity has the following expression ,    @xmath139    the potential has the following expression which could be given by ,    @xmath140    thus 4-velocity components are given by for this potential to yield ,    @xmath141    note that for this case as well we have the following result @xmath142 .",
    "if we have used equation ( @xmath143 ) then we might have obtained that the velocity has the same expression as that given by ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "also the acceleration has no change only @xmath145 is non zero and has the value given by ( @xmath146 ) . if we proceed in an identical way then we obtain the following result for the velocity of a particle relative to an observer ,    @xmath147^{2}}\\ ] ]    the most interesting part of this velocity expression corresponds to the fact that when at some finite @xmath2 the quantity @xmath148 then @xmath94 . so even if it had not go to @xmath149 the particle is seen to move with the velocity of light . however under the same situation as above such that both the particle and the observer moves with the same impact parameter we obtain that this case is prohibited and the particle has @xmath76 less than @xmath96 for all @xmath2 .",
    "this singularity corresponds to @xmath150    however this particular result is actually an artifact of our co - ordinate system . for string theory , the statement that the spacetime has singularity when @xmath150 is actually irrelevant . since the strings do not couple to the metric @xmath119 but rather to @xmath151 .",
    "this metric appear in string @xmath152 model . in terms of the string metric",
    "the effective lagrangian would become @xcite ,    @xmath153\\ ] ]    hence the charged black hole metric ,    @xmath154    this metric is identical to the metric given in equation @xmath155 where we have just rescaled the metric by some conformal factor which is finite every where outside and on the horizon . with this choice of metric and the assumption that energy is high or",
    "radius is small we obtain the following expression for relative velocity ,    @xmath156^{2}}\\ ] ]    this is completely identical to the result in equation ( @xmath99 ) , however the metric is completely different , here the general form would be @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "hence we arrive at a very important result that for both the spherically symmetric solution in section ( [ vs1 ] ) and that for dilaton gravity has the same velocity profile .",
    "in this section we consider a class of alternative theories of gravity in four dimensions defined by modifying the einstein - hilbert action through all possible quadratic , algebraic curvature scalars , multiplied by constants or non - constant couplings as ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , + @xmath160    @xmath161\\ ] ]    where @xmath138 is the determinant of the metric @xmath162 ; @xmath163 are the ricci scalar and tensor , the riemann tensor and its dual @xcite , respectively ; @xmath164 is the lagrangian density for other matter ; @xmath165 is a scalar field ; @xmath166 are coupling constants ; and @xmath167 .",

    "we assume that there is a constant charge @xmath238 at @xmath149 and the vector potential be @xmath239 such that @xmath240 .    in this metric",
    "the metric function @xmath241 will be real for @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the largest real solution of the cubic equation ,    @xmath244    by a transformation of the radial co - ordinates we can show that @xmath245 is an essential singularity of the spacetime .",
    "we shall choose @xmath246 and shall consider the @xmath247ve sign in front of square root of equation @xmath248 which leads to asymptotically flat solution .",
    "however note that the line element as presented in equation ( @xmath249 ) is exactly of the same form as we have used in equation ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus the velocity of a test particle relative to an observer would have the same form as presented in equation ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus all the properties of this velocity remain valid in this emgb gravity and shows the usefulness of our definition of velocity .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is a widely accepted as a fundamental theory relating matter energy density to geometric properties of spacetime .",
    "the standard big - bang cosmological model can explain the evolution of the universe well except inflation and late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "although many scalar field models have been constructed in the frame work of string theory and supergravity to explain inflation but cosmic microwave background radiation still do not show any evidence in favor of a particular model .",
    "the same kind of approach is also taken to explain cosmic acceleration by introducing different dark energy models where also concrete observation is still lacking .",
    "thus one of the simplest choice is to modify gr action by introducing a term @xmath8 in the lagrangian , where @xmath250 is an arbitrary function of scalar curvature @xmath52 .",
    "there exists two methods for deriving field equations , first , by varying the action with respect to metric tensor @xmath119 .",
    "the other method called palatini method should not be discussed here .in",
    "f(r ) gravity ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , the scalar curvature @xmath52 in the einstein - hilbert action    @xmath251    gets replaced by an appropriate function of scalar curvature :    @xmath252    varying this action we readily obtain the corresponding field equation to be given by ,    @xmath253    several solutions ( often exact ) to this field equation may be found but due to complicated nature of field equations the number of such exact solutions are much less than that in general relativity . without any matter and assuming the ricci tensor to be covariantly constant equation ( @xmath254 ) reduces to the following algebraic equation ,    @xmath255    from the above equation we can show that schwarzchild-(anti-)de sitter space is an exact vacuum solution to it .",
    "thus the respective line element would be given by ,    @xmath256    here the minus and plus sign corresponds to de sitter and anti de sitter space respectively , @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath60 is the length parameter of ( anti-)de sitter space , which is related to the curvature @xmath257 ( the plus sign corresponds to de sitter space and minus sign corresponds to anti de sitter space ) .",
    "the vacuum solution for @xmath8 gravity also has the same form as we have used in equation ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus all the results of section [ vs1 ] will remain valid here as well .",
    "hence the relative velocity will have the same characteristics in vacuum solution for @xmath8 gravity theory as well .",
    "this justifies our assertion as stated in section @xmath10 .",
    "we have shown that velocity of any ingoing particle with respect to observer sets as defined in the section ( @xmath10 ) for a general spherically symmetric potential with unit 2-sphere is always less than that of light outside the singular point , it approaches the speed of light as @xmath93 .",
    "however the notion of static observers are not valid for @xmath258 .",
    "it is valid only for region outside the event horizon .",
    "thus we have defined ingoing observers and determine velocity with respect to the observer .",
    "we found that velocity of the test particle always remain less than 1 .",
    "for a different choice of metric with a function on 2-sphere we found that the velocity is always less than 1 which may not be self - evident in one set of co - ordinates , but by going to another set we have actually shown that the previous results are retained .",
    "finally the spherically symmetric solution in quadratic gravity shows another instance of the correctness of our result .",
    "however there we have obtained a correction factor to the velocity expression due to presence of quadratic terms and hence this directly shows that the velocity profile of an object differ considerably in alternative theories from the result in einstein gravity .",
    "however that particular correction term would be planck suppressed and hence very difficult to observe , however just out side the event horizon of the bh , where the tidal effects are huge these effects can in principle be observed .",
    "for the other two theories we have obtained the same expression as for the general spherically symmetric model .",
    "thus they follow our previous assertion connecting to the relative velocity of a test particle .",
    "also it should be noted that the above analysis is not restricted to einstein gravity or the solutions we have discussed , it can also be applied to other spherically symmetric black hole solutions in other modified gravity theories .",
    "also it could be extended to higher dimensional black holes .",
    "extension to rotating black holes would be an interesting work for the future .",
