    "a prerequisite is that the corresponding boundary of the cdl is occasionally hit by a shock wave , which triggers a richtmeyer - meshkov instability .",

    "shock bound interaction zones come in many physical varieties and an intricate interplay exists between the cdl and the confining shocks .",
    "much work remains to be done , especially also with regard to observational and theoretical consequences .",
    "the presented results raise , in particular , the following questions .",
    "one question concerns the wide spread assumption that the relative speed of high velocity colliding flows translates more or less directly into the hardness of the x - ray spectrum . at least under isothermal conditions the confining shocks are not perpendicular to the colliding flows but steepen with increasing @xmath9",
    "this should soften the spectrum and shift part of the emission from the confining shocks to internal shocks of the cdl  @xcite .",
    "whether geometrically thin , resolved cooling layers behave similarly remains to be studied .",
    "another topic coming to mind are the relation between sbizs and 3d periodic box simulations .",
    "the later have enormously improved our understanding of supersonic turbulence  @xcite .",
    "all the more one may ask to what degree these results carry over to the cdl in a sbiz , where surface effects play a role .",
    "three points may be raised .    in an isothermal sbiz , @xmath8 , the energy input into the cdl , and the spatial scale on which this energy input is modulated all depend on each other . in 3d box simulations , the energy input and its spatial modulation - the driving wave length - are usually chosen independently .",
    "the effect of this difference on the turbulence characteristics remains to be clarified .",
    "a second point is the velocity field , which is clearly anisotropic in the cdl but usually isotropic by design in 3d box simulations . finally , when computing a cdl - averaged structure function ( sf ) for our 3d cdl ( compute sfs for each point in the cdl , using only points in the cdl , then taking the average over all sfs ) it resembles more closely the observation based sfs by  @xcite than those typically found for 3d boxes  @xcite .",
    "the reason is not yet clear",
    ". it could be the finite spatial extension of the cdl , its inhomogeneous , anisotropic interior , or simply a too coarse resolution .",
    "further studies of sbizs are needed , both with basic physics and with more elaborate models , and with particular attention to the interplay between the confining shocks and the turbulent cdl .",
    "the authors wish to thank the crew running the hp superdome at eth zurich and the people of the swiss center for scientific computing , cscs manno , where the simulations were performed .",
    "the authors much appreciated the stimulating discussions during astronum , in particular with e. audit , p. hennebelle , a. kritsuk , and w. schmidt ."
