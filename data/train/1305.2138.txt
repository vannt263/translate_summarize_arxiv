    "gamma - ray astronomy has rapidly advanced in recent years due to results from the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , which is sensitive to high - energy gamma rays from @xmath5 mev to @xmath6 gev @xcite , and from imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , which detect very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath7 gev ) gamma rays . the survey capability and wide energy range of the lat",
    "also provides useful information on transient activities of known gamma - ray sources and potential vhe emitters .    in a recent analysis of lat data , searches for sources of vhe photons found thirteen promising candidates of vhe gamma - ray emission at high ( @xmath8 ) redshifts",
    "the detections of kuv 00311@xmath11938 , pks 0426@xmath1380 , and 4c + 55.17 was first reported in the lat bright active galactic nuclei source list @xcite .",
    "all these sources except pks 2142@xmath175 are found in the first lat agn catalog @xcite , and all appear in the second lat agn catalog @xcite .",
    "depending on source redshift , vhe gamma rays above a characteristic energy @xmath9 are absorbed by photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) during propagation through intergalactic space , and create electron - positron pairs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the detection of vhe gamma rays from distant sources therefore provides useful information on the formation of stars that make the ebl .",
    "the secondary electrons and positrons ( hereafter called electrons unless stated otherwise ) produced by @xmath11 pair creation generate gamma rays by compton - scattering target photons of the ebl and cmb , initiating an electromagnetic cascade if the produced gamma rays are subsequently absorbed .",
    "the resultant secondary photons also contribute to the gamma - ray flux .",
    "their fluxes are also affected by intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) due to magnetic deflection of the parent electrons and produce , depending in detail on the strength of the igmf and its coherence length , a gamma - ray halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the cases of nearby extreme hbls such as 1es 0229 + 200 , we have previously shown that gamma - ray spectra above @xmath19 tev give a hint for the distinction because the hadronic scenario predicts harder spectra above @xmath20 tev than the gamma - ray - induced cases @xcite . here",

    "four equal - width logarithmic bins per decade were used to calculate the differential spectra of the sources . when gamma - ray data were fitted , we took sources listed in lat 2-year gamma ray source ( 2fgl ) catalog @xcite into account in the source region .",

    "the resultant spectra are consistent with those of @xcite , where _ ultraclean _ events are adopted , and the 2fgl results . when no photon or just one photon was detected , or a ts smaller than 9 ( corresponding to @xmath31 ) was obtained for an energy bin , a 95% confidence level upper limit was calculated by the bayesian method provided in _",

    "note that @xmath61 corresponds to the case where a cascade component dominates in the high - to - vhe energy ranges .",
    "the requirement that the observed high - energy _",
    "fermi_-lat spectra are reproduced is used to normalize the intrinsic spectra of the sources .    in the case of uhecr - induced cascades ,",
    "the source terms are replaced by the deposition rates of electrons and gamma rays at each point during uhecr propagation .",
    "the deposition rates are calculated based on one - dimensional propagation of uhe protons , following calculations in @xcite .",
    "the injection spectrum of protons with energy @xmath62 is assumed to be a power - law with an exponential cutoff of the form @xmath63 .",
    "we take @xmath64 , @xmath65 ev , and the minimum energy of @xmath66 ev . the resultant cascade spectra are insensitive to the value of @xmath67 , though the normalization is affected by @xmath67 and the uhecr energy - loss length due to bethe - heitler pair creation becomes shortest at @xmath68 ev for @xmath69 .",
    "the normalization of the uhecr proton spectra is set as in the gamma - ray - induced cases .",
    "a clear difference between gamma - ray and uhecr - induced cascades is the continuous injection of electrons through bethe - heitler pair creation during uhecr propagation in the latter case .",
    "uhecrs with @xmath70 ev have energy - loss paths @xmath49 gpc for bethe - heitler pair production , whereas 10  100 tev gamma rays only travel @xmath71  200 mpc before being absorbed by @xmath11 production .",
    "this allows uhe electrons to be injected and cascade to such energies far from the source .",
    "thus , some vhe photons can reach observers before being attenuated even when @xmath72 , resulting in a harder spectrum than expected for a gamma - ray - induced cascade .",
    "figure [ fig : kuv00311sed ] shows the sed of the bl lac object kuv 00311@xmath11938 , the nearest object in the source list . this is the only source detected by iacts in the @xcite sample at present . the hard spectrum obtained by lat",

    "the flux lower than the sensitivity curve can be achieved under a relaxed criterion of wider energy - bins and lower significance required to estimate flux in each bin . ]",
    "we confirmed that the seds of the other more distant sources in the list , excepting sources with steep spectra , namely pks 0426 - 380 and pks 2142 - 75 , are reproduced by both gamma - ray - induced and uhecr - induced cascade scenarios for the quoted redshifts .",
    "more distant sources allow the possibility to distinguish the two scenarios clearly by the difference in predicted spectral fluxes above @xmath49 tev . due to their large distances , a sharper cutoff of the gamma - ray - induced spectra compared to the uhecr - induced spectra",

    "conventionally the differential sensitivity requires a @xmath79 signal for a 50-hour observation in each of four equal - width logarithmic bins per decade , whereas the integral sensitivity is defined as a @xmath79 excess of gamma rays above a given threshold energy for a 50-hour observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", this source can be detected by cta below @xmath85 gev for both scenarios .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between the two scenarios because the difference in detecting photons for the two scenarios would be larger than the range of uncertainties implied by the ebl models used , even with the flux of the characteristic hadronic plateau at high energies being below the cta sensitivity .",
    "thus , even gamma - ray sources with @xmath86 can be utilized to disentangle the two scenarios .",
    "other sources detectable with 50-hour observations with cta in the source list are ton 116 , b3 1307 + 433 , 4c + 55.17 , and pks 1958 - 179 .",
    "note that the sensitivity of cta north may be somewhat worse above @xmath87 tev because no small - size telescopes are projected to be a part of the array .",
    "an important uncertainty for this study is the source redshift .",
    "it is difficult to determine accurate photometric redshifts of bl lac objects owing to the strong nonthermal emission from relativistically beamed jets concealing the host - galaxy or broad - line region emission lines .",
    "for instance , a recent detailed spectroscopic study of kuv 00311@xmath11938 identifies no line related to the host galaxy , and provides a conservative lower limit of @xmath88 from a mg ii doublet of narrow lines in intergalactic medium @xcite , contrary to the often quoted value of @xmath4 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "uncertainty in redshift measurement results in two major problems for our study .",
    "the first is the resultant uncertainty of the predicted vhe fluxes of a source .",
    "a lower limit on redshift still remains useful because the uhecr - induced cascade scenario could be favored if vhe gamma rays are detected above energies where the flux in the gamma - ray - induced scenario is already suppressed assuming the lower - limit redshift . in other cases , a well - determined source redshift may be required to disentangle the two scenarios , as scenario discrimination depends both on the shape of the spectral cutoff and the cutoff energy @xmath9 , which depends on the source redshift .",
    "the second problem is the resulting uncertainty in the total luminosity of gamma rays and/or protons to reproduce the observed flux .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that several distant hbls have isotropic equivalent gamma - ray luminosities exceeding the trend of the blazar sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on photometric redshift measurements .",
    "the same is true of some blazars in the list in the gamma - ray - induced scenario if their quoted redshifts are correct .",
    "accurate redshift of sources is therefore also important to check the blazar sequence .",
    "although we have focused on spectral information to discriminate between the two possibilities , variability is also another critical clue .",
    "cascade components can not have short variability timescales , since the shortest time scales are @xmath89 in the gamma - ray - induced case and @xmath90 in the uhecr - induced case , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that , in the gamma - ray - induced case , cascaded gamma rays should be regarded as a mixture of attenuated and cascade components .",
    "therefore , strong variability is possible if the cascade component is suppressed , whereas not in the uhecr - induced case . in our sample , there is no strong evidence for fast variability in kuv 00311@xmath11938 and pg 1246 + 586 above @xmath20 gev ( see figs . [",
    "fig : kuv00311int ] and [ fig : pg1246int ] ) .",
    "variability is weaker at the lowest photon energies of the cascade . by equating @xmath91 with the thomson energy - loss timescale of relativistic electrons in the cmb",
    ", one finds that the cascade from blazars at low redshift ( @xmath92 ) extends to photon energies as low as @xmath93 kev@xmath94 .",
    "one potential drawback of the uhecr - induced cascade scenario is that it may require large powers emitted in uhecrs .",
    "this is especially true if uhecrs are not beamed .",
    "if the blazars are embedded in magnetized structures , i.e. , filaments and clusters of galaxies , as naturally expected , the jet - corrected cr luminosity required to reproduce the observed flux is about one and two orders of magnitude larger than in the case of no surrounding magnetic field , respectively , because of the isotropization of cr protons in the magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite derive lower limits of uhecr power following this scenario for extreme hbls with known redshift , and point out that the required power is comparable with or in some cases exceeds the eddington luminosity of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of the blazars and if uhecrs are isotropized .",
    "some blazars considered in this study may require uhecr powers close to the eddington luminosity of smbh mass @xmath95 .",
    "we have considered igmfs weak enough so as not to affect the spectrum above @xmath20 gev . for stronger igmfs ,",
    "the cascade radiation in both the hadronic and leptonic scenarios becomes harder due to fewer low - energy photons made in the jet direction .",
    "this hardening may , however , be hidden because of intrinsic source gamma rays with energies @xmath96 . given a sharp spectral cutoff in the gamma - ray - induced scenario ,",
    "it is clear evidence of the hadronic scenario and therefore the sources of uhecrs that a spectrum harder than that predicted from the gamma - ray - induced scenario is observed .      to summarize ,",
    "the seds of many of the distant blazars listed in @xcite can be modeled by both gamma - ray - induced and uhecr - induced cascade scenarios , as shown here explicitly for kuv 00311@xmath11938 and pg 1246 + 586 . some of these blazars are predicted to be detectable by cta , and their spectral properties will permit these two scenarios to be distinguished by the different detection threshold energies and spectral behaviors .",
    "preliminary h.e.s.s .",
    "observations favor the hadronic interpretation for kuv 00311@xmath11938 if at redshift @xmath4 .",
