    "experimental results from flavor physics and electroweak precision measurements have long established the standard model pattern of flavor and cp violation .",
    "the only sources of flavor and cp violation are the yukawa couplings , and the one essentially unknown parameter is the relative coupling strength of the heavy third - generation quark to the @xmath0 boson , the ckm mixing angle @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "its knowledge is crucial to establish the unitarity of the ckm mixing matrix in the standard model .",
    "because the su(3 ) symmetry of qcd does not see electroweak charges , this coupling can not be determined in qcd - mediated top pair production .",
    "instead , we rely on the electroweak production process for a single top quark in association with a quark jet to measure this parameter of the standard model .",
    "the problem of modern particle physics is that while on the one hand we have good reasons to expect that we will see a non - trivial ultraviolet completion of the standard model at the tev scale , we do not know where in such an extended model this particular flavor structure originates from .",
    "one of the standard candidates for such new physics at the tev scale with all its benefits from a dark matter candidate and stabilized higgs mass to a valid grand unified theory is the minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm  @xcite .",
    "mainly in the soft - breaking terms in the mssm lagrangian there are multiple sources of flavor and cp violation which naturally predict observable effects , including flavor changing neutral currents . assuming only one set of supersymmetric partner states we can implement the experimental constraints by postulating a symmetry dubbed minimal flavor violation .",
    "this implies that there still be no sources of flavor violation other than the yukawa couplings , the spurions of flavor symmetry breaking  @xcite",
    ". an interesting alternative might be the promotion of the gauge sector to @xmath2 supersymmetry , leading to dirac fermion partners of the standard model gauge bosons and additional scalar particles , all clearly visible at the lhc  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we instead focus on the more subtle effects of an approximate minimal flavor violation symmetry .",
    "focussing on the quark / squark sector , minimal flavor violation forces the soft squark masses to be almost diagonal in flavor space and the scalar trilinear @xmath3 terms  for example describing squark - squark - higgs interactions  to be proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "corrections consistent with the standard model flavor symmetry are induced by higher powers in the yukawa couplings .",
    "since we can not derive minimal flavor violation from first principles , we need to measure if and by how much it is broken . in the down - quark sector",
    ", squarks contribute to @xmath4-and @xmath5-physics observables via squark - gluino loops mediated by the strong coupling constant @xmath6 , which gives us powerful tests of minimal flavor violation .",
    "in contrast , in the the up - quark sector such one - loop effects are proportional to the weak coupling @xmath7 or the yukawa couplings and much harder to measure . the first - third and second third generation mixing between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 squarks is essentially invisible for kaon , charm and b experiments  @xcite .",
    "integrating out the heavy supersymmetric particles , such loop contributions lead to flavor - violating quark couplings to standard model gauge bosons , for example a @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 or @xmath14-@xmath12-@xmath13 vertex  @xcite . at the lhc processes involving valence",
    "quarks are generally more interesting , so we will focus on the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 vertex , but its second generation counter part can of course be treated the same way",
    ".    the search for this largely unconstrained effective coupling is linked with the measurement of @xmath1 through the relevant lhc processes . while the effective gluon vertex leads to the direct production of an isolated top quark ,",
    "single top production is accompanied by a quark jet .",
    "however , at the lhc we know that the radiation of additional quark and gluon jets from the incoming quarks is ubiquitous . therefore , the question becomes : how can we tell apart electroweak ckm effects in single top production ( and its two production mechanisms ) and strong effects from non - minimal new physics in direct top production , all including top quark decays as well as realistic qcd effects and backgrounds .",
    "in spite of the fact that there are many flavor observables constraining squark mixing beyond minimal flavor violation , there are two entries in the squark mass matrices which are still largely unconstrained . even though we actually use the diagonalized squark mass matrix , it is instructive to discuss the results in terms of dimensionless mass insertions @xmath15 ( for the squark handedness @xmath16 , the generation indices @xmath17 , and the weak isospin @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 are the relevant off - diagonal entries and @xmath20 the corresponding mean diagonal entry in the squark mass matrix .    because we are not interested in the strongly constrained down - type mixings @xmath21 and we focus on left - right mixing only",
    ", we denote @xmath22 the unconstrained left - right mixing terms are the off - diagonal @xmath23 between @xmath8 and @xmath10 and the diagonal @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the left - right swapped @xmath25 instead mixes @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is constrained by @xmath28 transitions  @xcite and @xmath29 in @xmath30 mixing  @xcite .",
    "the reason why the bounds on @xmath25 are strong and those on @xmath23 hardly exist is the chargino - top loop : if the chargino is a mix of the wino and the higgsino , the latter will have a large yukawa coupling to the external bottom .",
    "the @xmath31 instead couples to the wino content of the chargino , which forces is to be left handed @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath25 constraint can only be relaxed by heavy squarks .",
    "assuming minimal flavor violation the generation - diagonal entry @xmath32 is of the general form @xmath33 and does not need to be small . as a matter of fact",
    ", it can lead to a large splitting of the two stop masses and ameliorates the little hierarchy problem , so we do not expect it to be small either . it is currently only constrained via the lower limit on the light higgs mass and can be measured either in stop mixing or in the minimal supersymmetric higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "the generation mixing entry @xmath23 mixes @xmath8 and @xmath10 and at one - loop induces the flavor - changing chromo - magnetic operator  @xcite @xmath34 via a squark - gluino loop . as shown on the left fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn_dtop ] this operator implies direct top production at hadron colliders @xmath35 , with a leptonic @xmath0 decay to avoid an undetectable purely hadronic final state .",
    "the corresponding partonic cross section is typically suppressed by the heavy gluino mass in the loop and therefore proportional to @xmath36 the second diagram in fig.[fig : feyn_dtop ] contributes proportional to @xmath37 , which is negligible after fulfilling all flavor constraints . due to the absolute values",
    "squared they are invariant under complex phases of the squark mixing parameters .",
    "this process to our knowledge is the only way to measure the otherwise unaccessible @xmath23 in the era of lhc and super-@xmath5 factories .",
    "usually , the mssm parameter space beyond minimal flavor violation is huge , and physical processes typically involve many possible contributions which are free to cancel each other .",
    "in contrast , direct top production is a strongly interacting process and depends only on the masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the squark mixing parameters @xmath40,@xmath23 and @xmath25 . for small values of @xmath41",
    "we have to include @xmath42 in the expression for @xmath24 . for our numerical study",
    "we use the sps2  @xcite inspired reference point with the gut - scale masses @xmath43  gev , @xmath44  gev and @xmath45 .",
    "the higgs sector is characterized by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the relevant weak - scale masses for our process are @xmath48 this gives us a light ( mostly ) stop mass of 955  gev and a light higgs mass of 117  gev .",
    "the lightest neutralino is a viable dark matter candidate . for the calculation of the direct top production rate at this point we use feynarts , formcalc  @xcite , looptools  @xcite , and hadcalc  @xcite .",
    "we include all supersymmetric qcd and electroweak contributions .",
    "there are four major backgrounds for direct top production @xmath49 with a charge identified lepton from the @xmath0 decay and a tagged bottom jet with a tagging probability of 50% and a mis - tagging probability of 1% @xmath50 of the three @xmath0 plus one jet backgrounds the irreducible combination is suppressed with respect to the mis - tagging background by roughly two orders of magnitude . similarly , the more likely mis - tag of a charm requires a @xmath51 initial state and should be at maximum of the same order as the valence - quark induced @xmath52 process .",
    "most importantly , the kinematic distributions of the three are very similar , so we expect all three to vanish as a roughly constant fraction of the leading @xmath52 background .",
    "the two - bottoms background process can become dangerous when the two bottom jet are close enough to look like one bottom jet from gluon splitting . if we require the two bottom jets to be close ( @xmath53 ) the resulting @xmath54 rate is of the same order as the subleading @xmath55 production , which again means that in the following discussion we will focus on the mis - tagged @xmath56 background .",
    "all of the background and the signal pass the acceptance ( and triggering ) cuts @xmath57 without a major reduction .",

    "we can follow this behavior by noticing that for the signal the lepton and in particular the bottom quark are moving into the forward direction , peaked around pseudorapidities of two .",

    "interestingly enough , the radiated mis - tagged jet above our @xmath66 threshold is also fairly central .",
    "the problem with this general kinematic feature is that it is not strong enough to allow for an efficient cut in our analysis .",

    "these jets will be correctly described by the hard matrix element and for small transverse momenta also correctly by the parton shower .",

    "in this paper we have shown how we can exploit the qcd jet activity to extract direct top production from the qcd background and to tell apart @xmath12-channel single top production , @xmath78-channel single top production , and direct top production .",
    "direct top production is the only way to observe or constrain the supersymmetric flavor - violating squark mass entry @xmath109 in the near future .",
    "it is mediated by the flavor changing neutral current @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 interaction and has to be extracted from @xmath0+jets backgrounds with a light - flavor jet mis - tagged as a bottom .",
    "while kinematic cuts based on the top resonance structure of the matrix element are not sufficient to produce a promising signal - to - background ratio @xmath71 , we find that additional cuts on the jet correlation from qcd radiation improve this ratio enough to allow for a meaningful lhc analysis .",
    "the same kind of qcd jet correlations with the top decay lepton allow us to distinguish ( normalized ) samples of @xmath12-channel single top production , @xmath78-channel single top production , and direct top production .",
    "all three channels are irreducible if we consider searches for one top quark plus jets .",
    "our distinction is purely based on angular correlations and serves as an orthogonal test to possible bottom tags . in single",
    "top searches applying explicit bottom tags only later in the analysis allows us to make use of the parton density enhancement when looking for flavor - changing top couplings .",
    "both methods combined should be able to unambiguously determine the third generation flavor structure of the standard model , including the ckm mixing element @xmath1 as well as new - physics effects .",
