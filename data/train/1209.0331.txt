    "with the advent of the lhc , the study of @xmath0 production has become more accessible than ever .",
    "first results  @xcite , in @xmath1 and pbpb collisions , have already been obtained and the @xmath0 production pattern at the lhc differs from that of the lighter @xmath6 s .",
    "@xmath0 s are thus complementary probes of the qcd dynamics in @xmath1 and pbpb collisions besides the charmonia  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to achieve a good understanding of their production mechanism in the vacuum as well as of how different the nuclear effects in proton - nucleus collisions are when they act on @xmath0 and on @xmath7 .",
    "i first discuss @xmath1 collisions .",
    "i show that the @xmath2-integrated yields obtained at lo in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( the @xmath10-quark velocity in the @xmath0 ) agree with the data at different @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in turn",
    ", i briefly mention the impact of qcd corrections on the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "in particular , a comparison with the lhcb data is shown and it demonstrates that the nlo csm describes very well the @xmath0 yield up to 5 gev .",
    "the csm also provides with parameter - free predictions for @xmath0 cross - section ratios in agreement with the most recent lhc data .",
    "finally , the nnlo leading-@xmath2 contributions seem to be required to account for the data at larger @xmath2 as the comparison with the nnlo@xmath13 yield shows . in a second section ,",
    "i discuss the effect of ( cold ) nuclear matter as probed in @xmath0 production in @xmath14au collisions at rhic and @xmath5pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "i discuss first the total number of @xmath0 produced in @xmath1 collisions as predicted by the csm at lo in @xmath8 and irrespective of their transverse momenta .",
    "contrary to what is sometimes claimed in the literature ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) the yield from colour - singlet transitions agrees with the experimental measurements .",
    "there is a slight discrepancy at rhic energy with the star data  @xcite , which is nevertheless less precise states are not resolved and the feed - down from @xmath15 has never been measured at this energy . ] than that of the tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite , with which the lo csm evaluations are in good agreement .    fig .",
    "[ fig : csm - xsection ] ( a ) and ( b ) nicely illustrate the situation .",
    "both the energy and the rapidity dependences of the @xmath2-integrated cross section are well reproduced by the lo band .",
    "the theory uncertainty at lo is unfortunately large due to the presence of three powers of @xmath8 in the lo cross - section , hence one finds a significant renormalisation - scale dependence .",
    "the experimental measurements at the tevatron and the lhc are in fact more precise than the theory .",
    "yet , it has to be noted that , at the lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : csm - xsection ] ( b ) ) , the experimental points tend to lie in the lower part of the theory band .",
    "the situation is nevertheless more intricate when the @xmath2 dependence of the yield is concerned  @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the leading-@xmath2 contributions to @xmath0 hadroproduction only appear at nnlo in the csm . for the time being , only the nlo cross section  @xcite is fully known along with a partial evaluation of the nnlo yield , dubbed nnlo@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "as expected from the discussion of the @xmath2 integrated yields , the cross section at low @xmath2 is well reproduced by the nlo yield ; it only differs from the lo yield by a harder @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "the partial nnlo yield is even harder and it matches the data at higher @xmath2 . yet , a full nnlo computation is needed before drawing final conclusions .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : csm - xsection ] ( c ) by a comparison between the lhcb data for @xmath16 compared to the nlo and nnlo@xmath13 csm predictions for the direct yield .",
    "the full nlo evaluation without any ajustable parameter perfectly matches the lhcb data up to 5 gev .",
    "the comparison is equally good with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 states  @xcite provided that one subtracts the part of the yield from feed downs . at larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the leading-@xmath2 contributions of the nnlo seem to be required to describe the data .",
    "overall , this confirms that this sole cs channel contribution seems to be sufficient to convincingly reproduce the total yield  @xcite _ as well as _",
    "the cross section differential in @xmath2  @xcite as measured at rhic  @xcite , the tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite once @xmath19 ( nlo ) and @xmath20 ( nnlo ) contributions are included .      despite the rather large theoretical uncertainties of the csm predictions , these are free of any adjustable parameter .",
    "the overall normalisation or the @xmath2 and @xmath12 dependence can not be tuned by fitting non - perturbative parameters , for instance . in particular , at lo in @xmath9 , ratios of cross sections for _ direct _ @xmath21 are obtained straightforwardly .",
    "these are in fact simple ratios of schrdinger s wave function at the origin , @xmath22 .",
    "we have : @xmath23    as we mentioned , these numbers hold for the _ direct _ yields . from an early cdf study  @xcite at the tevatron ( 1.8 tev ) , we know that roughly 50@xmath24 of the inclusive @xmath25 s are directly produced .",
    "we will make the reasonable assumption that a similar fraction holds at the lhc , with the drawback that cdf did not measure low-@xmath2",
    "@xmath15 s . from the recent cms measurement  @xcite ( @xmath26 nb )",
    ", we can thus obtain an evaluation of the direct @xmath25 yield : @xmath27 nb . in turn",
    ", it is straightforward to get what is expected from the csm for the direct @xmath16 yield at 7 tev : @xmath28  nb  @xmath29  nb .",
    "this is surprisingly close to the value measured nb @xmath30 45 nb ] by cms  @xcite , 45 nb , assuming that 100@xmath24 of the @xmath16 are directly produced .",
    "the latter assumption was perfectly sound until recently .",
    "however , atlas has made the first observation  @xcite of a candidate for the @xmath31 which is likely to decay into @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath16 yield may not be 100@xmath24 direct .    from the above arguments",
    ", one would not expect any @xmath2 dependence of these cross - section ratios .",
    "two effects should nevertheless be kept in mind . at low @xmath2",
    ", the @xmath2 dependence of the cross section is known to be affected by mass effects . indeed",
    ", it does not follow a simple power - law falloff in @xmath2",
    ". we should be aware that the ratio predicted above hold in the limit where @xmath32 for all the states .",
    "such an approximation is not ideal for the @xmath33 states for instance .",
    "another effect comes from a simple kinematical effect of the feed - down : the transverse momentum of a daughter particle is always smaller than that of the parent ( the excited state here ) .",
    "quantitatively , we can write the approximate relation : @xmath34 .    such a rescaling of the @xmath2 spectrum does not matter if @xmath35 with @xmath36 fixed we would always keep the cross - section ratio independent of @xmath2 ( with a smaller feed - down for higher @xmath36 , though ) .",
    "however , if @xmath36 changes , which is especially true at low @xmath2 , this induces a @xmath2 dependence of the feed - down , even if both the direct production cross sections of the lower - lying state and of the excited state have the same @xmath2 dependence .",
    "the feed - down fraction is expected to increase when the @xmath2 dependence is mild and to decrease when it is steep . from the usual shape of @xmath37 ,",
    "one expects a decrease of the feed - down with @xmath2 . in turn",
    ", the cross - section ratio , @xmath38 with @xmath39 would increase with @xmath2 until the differential cross section gets the behaviour of a power law ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation is required to quantify this increase . yet",
    ", it is instructive to keep in mind that @xmath41 .",
    "such kinematical effects up to 50@xmath24 would not be surprising .",
    "this provides a reasonable explanation of the ratio increase observed by cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite on figs .",
    "[ fig : xsection - ratios ] .",
    "[ fig : xsection - ratios ]",
    "as we discussed in  @xcite , the survival probability of the @xmath0 ( or its pre - resonant state ) in the nuclear matter is significantly larger than for @xmath7  or conversely its `` absorption '' is small .",
    "this is due to its smaller size . on the contrary ,",
    "the impact of ( anti)shadowing is not necessarily small .",
    "when compared to @xmath7 results ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , two effects should be kept in mind .",
    "first , the energy scale of the scattering entering the nuclear - pdf evaluation ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) is expected to be three times larger for the @xmath0 than for the @xmath7 . a priori",
    ", we do not expect any saturation effect of the gluon densities  @xcite .",
    "second , and more importantly , the average momentum fractions of the partons in both colliding particles are three times larger in the @xmath0 case compared to that of @xmath7 s for a fixed quarkonium rapidity .",
    "this explains , for instance , why anti - shadowing could show up at a given rapidity for @xmath0 and not for @xmath7 .    at rhic ,",
    "@xmath0 production allows one to probe the gluon densities in a wide momentum - fraction range : at forward @xmath12 , it probes the shadowing region ; at mid @xmath12 , the anti - shadowing region ; and , at backward @xmath12 , the emc region .",
    "the latter is pretty much unknown for gluons and we emphasised in  @xcite that @xmath0 production in @xmath14au collisions at rhic energies can be an invaluable probe of the unexplored large-@xmath45 dynamics of gluons in bound nucleon inside heavy nucleus ( see also  @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , the slight @xmath0 suppression at backward @xmath12 observed by phenix  @xcite nearly rules out a gluon excess from fermi motion for @xmath45 s close to 0.3 as predicted in  @xcite and it may even be the first hint of gluon emc suppression .    at mid @xmath12 , an update of the star data  @xcite is awaited to confirm the absence of a significant anti - shadowing . on the contrary , the forward phenix data  @xcite are already precise enough to indicate that an ingredient is missing in the existing analyses since the conventional shadowing is far from being enough  @xcite to explain the large suppression of the @xmath0 yield .",
    "fractional parton energy loss for forward - angle quarkonium production might explain this anomalous suppression , along the same lines as the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for the  production in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "taking into account the rapidity shift between the lab system and the c.m.s .",
    "of the colliding particles due to the imbalance in their energies at the lhc at @xmath46  tev , one expects an excess of @xmath0 between 5 and 15@xmath24 due to the anti - shadowing in pb@xmath5 collisions in the acceptance of the alice detector . in @xmath5pb collisions , for which the lhcb detector will also take data , one expects a suppression ranging from 20 to 25@xmath24 in the forward rapidity region .",
    "such numbers are not to be overlooked : remember that in pbpb collisions , such nuclear effects act roughly speaking quadratically compared to in @xmath5pb collisions !",
    "cold nuclear effects on the @xmath0 yield can thus be up to 20 - 30@xmath24 in pbpb collisions .",
    "this calls for a detailed @xmath0 analysis in the forthcoming @xmath5pb / pb@xmath5 runs at the lhc .    along these lines",
    ", let us keep in mind that , at rhic energies , the suppression of @xmath0 in @xmath14au collisions is of the same size as that of @xmath7 .",
    "novel effects such as fractional energy loss might be at work and need be subtracted for a proper analysis of the @xmath0 behaviour in the deconfined matter created in central heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .",
