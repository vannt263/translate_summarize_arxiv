    "no area preferences emerge for anti - hale regions .",
    "we find that anti - hale are just part of a broader distribution of tilt angles , possibly as a result of convective zone turbulence as previously proposed by many researchers .",
    "however , the misclassification of anti - hale near the equator is due to the heliographic equator not aligning with the magnetic equator .",
    "this is visible in the tilt angle distribution as a slight tendency for the anti - hale regions to be tilted 180  from their expected joy s law tilt angle .",
    "joy s law can not be observed by eye in the tilt - butterfly diagrams ( figures [ bflyli ] and [ bflydpd ] ) but must be teased out statistically by averaging over significant periods of time .",
    "this is evident by the lack of a smooth gradient in the color representing tilt angle in the butterfly wings when examining one hemisphere and one cycle . even after averaging and binning , the trend in tilt angle shows discontinuous behavior in that the mean or median tilt angle will decrease on average for a period of years then increase again suddenly .",
    "this may be related to distinct dynamo waves that occur within the solar cycle ( ternullo , 2007 ) .",
    "sunspots very near the equator are often assigned incorrect tilt angles due to the magnetic equator being offset a few degrees .",
    "for example , sunspots that have a northern hemispheric magnetic polarity and appear just below the heliographic equator ( presumably because the northern hemisphere is ahead in the sunspot cycle and has reached the equator first ) are assigned tilt angles as if they are produced from the southern hemisphere polarity .",
    "figure [ ahtot](a ) shows an increase in anti - hale near the end of each solar cycle . within 5  of the equator , 65 out of 470 ( 13.8% ) bipolar sunspot regions",
    "are anti - hale .",
    "the end of solar cycle 20 produced 14.8% anti - hale when sunspot activity is concentrated near the equator .",
    "+ example : an active region ( noaa11987/harp3784 ) straddles the equator but its central latitude is calculated to be 2  in the southern hemisphere on 2014 february 24 ( figure [ ar](a ) ) .",
    "dpd reported a tilt angle on that date to be -15.26@xmath9 . according to our definition , shown in figure [ sc24ex ] ,",
    "the tilt angle should be 15.26@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetogram in figure [ ar](b ) shows a magnetic orientation consistent with a northern hemisphere bmr for this solar cycle .",
    "it is probably that this region , slightly south of the equator , originated from magnetic dynamo activity in the northern hemisphere since the northern hemisphere is leading the southern hemisphere and reached the equator first .",
    "conversely , this region could have originated from dynamo action in the southern hemisphere with polarity orientation and tilt angle opposite from that anticipated via joy s law and hale s law .",
    "we suggest the former is more plausible .",
    "we propose assigning this region to the northern hemisphere based on tilt and polarity , with a caveat regarding latitude .",
    "also note that this active region has a significant tilt angle , not a zero tilt angle as predicted by many versions of joy s law that forces the tilt to be zero at the equator .",
    "the practice of forcing joy s law to zero at the equator is not supported by observations .",
    "doing so makes a huge difference in the slopes as reported in the literature and we find that there are , as often as not , bmrs with significant tilts at the equator . + [ !",
    "ht ] + 6 .",
    "the tilt angles of sunspot groups and associated scatter in the tilt angle values are crucial for the build up and reversals of the polar fields in surface flux transport simulations @xcite .",
    "recent efforts by @xcite have shown that the tilt angle scatter constitutes a significant random factor in the variability of cycle strength .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the inclusion of the 8.4% of anti - hale sunspots in surface flux transport models may allow for even greater cycle to cycle amplitude variability .    from points 1 and 2 ,",
    "we conclude that the physical processes that produce anti - hale regions are the same processes that produce sunspots obeying hale s polarity rules . knowing that tilt angles have a high scatter , we conclude that the tails of the tilt angle distribution function are quite wide and",
    "therefore 8.4% of all spots can have angle @xmath21  from the expected orientation .",
    "of course , many questions about tilt angles and anti - hale activity remain unanswered .",
    "there is , as always , more work to do ."
