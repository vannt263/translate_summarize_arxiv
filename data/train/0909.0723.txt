    "the semi - conservative replication of dna requires its unzipping by helicases , and synthesis of new strands over the opened parent strands by dna - polymerases ( dna - polymerase  iii ) with high processivity@xcite .",
    "the basic features of replication are as follows .",
    "the two strands of dna run in opposite directions .",
    "the polymerase with unidirectional 3-5 motion can then follow the helicase on one strand ( the leading strand ) only , but not on the other ( the lagging strand ) . though the two polymerases are identical , the lagging strand polymerase performs a more complicated job , e.g. ( i ) it makes the new strand in pieces ( okazaki fragments ) , ( ii ) it has to shift repeatedly to newer positions closer to the moving helicase , ( iii ) it restarts the polymerization process anew after every shift , and , then ( iv ) the small okazaki fragments are to be joined by dna ligase .",
    "in addition primase is required for initiation of the okazaki fragments , sliding clamp proteins to tether the polymerases to dna , to name a few more . moreover",
    ", the fidelity of replication requires additional repair or proof - reading capabilities which need to become functional as and when needed .",
    "processivity in this context is defined as the number of base pairs added at a stretch each time the replication machinery binds to dna ( for e. coli , @xmath0 base pair long dna is ultimately replicated in 40mins ) .",
    "it is understood that most of the polymeric molecules of the replication machinery can work independently in vitro but all of these need to work in tandem over a long time and long distance ( along the dna ) for the processivity observed during replication .",
    "the controversy with the replication dynamics can be summarized in the following way@xcite . in one class of models ,",
    "the replication machineries move on the dna .",
    "[ fig : repl]a .",
    "one needs tight coupling between the lagging strand polymerase and the helicase , though they are independent , to facilitate repeated recognition of the newly unzipped region of dna . not only the polymerase and helicase , others like the primase , ligase also need to get correlated on the lagging strand .",
    "the antithesis is the proposal of a replisome - a complex of all the objects staying together with the dna looping through the complex in a very particular manner@xcite .",
    "[ fig : repl]b .",
    "since the dna goes through the replisome , there is expected to be a depletion layer of nutrients surrounding a replisome and it needs to be supplemented by a current towards it .",
    "more perplexing is that , if a complex can exist for a long enough time during replication , then why it is so elusive in vitro and what is responsible for the `` bound state '' in vivo .",
    "single molecular experiments have revealed correlations between synthesis by t7 dna polymerase and t7 helicase activity on a dsdna , e.g. efficient duplex dna synthesis require combined action of polymerase and helicase but no direct or specific interaction between the polymerase and helicase play any role@xcite . for bacteriophage t4 , the assembly of the polymerase and the clamp - loader with dna has been found to be highly dynamic and well coordinated@xcite .",
    "the `` replisome '' may itself be dynamic in nature with not just two but even three polymerases , and others like repair factors can be dynamically attached to it@xcite . in case the replication process were tightly controlled , hard - coded in the functioning of the molecules , then that would be reflected in the statistics of the lengths of the okazaki fragments on the lagging strand as well . the probability distribution of the lengths of these fragments for t4 and t7 have been found to be very broad and highly non - gaussian , compared to very sharp distributions expected from individual primase controlled models@xcite .",
    "purely stochastic models have been proposed to study correlations in okazaki fragment distributions@xcite .",
    "these newer experimental methods and analysis , apart from elucidating the nature of the complexity of replication , are also bringing out the importance of dynamics and correlations ( also called coordination ) of the protein complexes and dna strands in particular near the fork .",
    "an important aspect of the replication process is the repair mechanism also involving helicases .",
    "a helicase is a motor protein that generally facilitates in opening the dna and leads the replication machineries .",
    "such a helicase moves from the unzipped ( i.e. , the open side ) to the closed side .",
    "there are actually many helicases , e.g. almost 20 in e. coli ( though not clear why so many ) , but they generically are known to have a part ( called the wedge domain ) that maintains the two strands of the dna at a distance much larger than the base pair distance . the motor action ( e.g. for dnab@xcite ) and often additional pulling action ( e.g. pcra@xcite ) carry the opening process on .",
    "it stops in case there is a nick or a lesion on the leading strand .",
    "the replication process stalls , the whole replication assembly disperses , and a repair process takes over . often , recg is the helicase that starts the repair job by performing a fork reversal@xcite .",
    "based on the crystal structure , it was suggested that the wedge domain maintains the separation but in addition there are two domains that sit on the zipped side and pushes the dna towards the unzipped side thereby scooping out the dna on the lagging strand@xcite .",
    "[ fig : recg ] .",
    "this continues until the nascent end on the leading strand is reached , forming a chickenfoot configuration .",
    "the job of recg is over , the repair process is completed by other objects via a holliday junction and then the replication restarts . in this model , recg has two jobs , zipping the parent strands and unzipping the nascent duplex on the lagging strand .",
    "the activities of a pre - assembled recg - dna on ( i ) a three way dna ( consisting of the y - fork with a nascent duplex on the lagging strand ) and ( ii ) a two - way dna ( consisting of a pure y - fork ) are found to be the same , if initial transients are ignored@xcite .",
    "we therefore take this view that the main job in the repair process of recg is the zipping of the dna or the fork reversal .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to show how a coupling of the helicase and the replication fork ( y - fork ) can be used to formulate the backward mobility of recg - like repair proteins , in addition to the forward motion of general helicases .",
    "our hypothesis is that the y - fork is an essential element in the whole replication process , and it is at the heart of the correlated dynamics@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is based on the observation that in both the biological models and experiments mentioned earlier , the common feature is the proximity of a y - fork - the junction of an unzipped and a zipped dna , and dynamics plays an important role , may even be responsible for the formation of the replisome .",
    "the first step to motivate this connection is to analyze the helicase activity .",
    "traditionally , dna opening is considered a melting phenomenon where thermal noise , fluctuations in base pair breaking - joining , and polymer configurations play important roles@xcite .",
    "a different mechanism is the force induced unzipping transition at temperatures below the melting point@xcite . in the unzipping scenario ,",
    "a coexistence of the two phases separated by a domain wall , at this first - order transition , is _ the _ y - fork .",
    "the wedge domain of a helicase provides the constraint to maintain the dna in a fixed distance ensemble , and , therefore , a y - fork develops .",
    "the helicase activity is then tantamount to setting the y - fork interface in motion . in this language ,",
    "the replication problem can be recast as a velocity selection problem .",
    "the y - fork dynamics is described by the internal dynamics of dna , the helicase motion is controlled by the energy supply and its own dynamical mechanism , and similarly for other individuals .",
    "thus , each has its own characteristic velocity acting alone , and that s the velocity one measures in vitro@xcite . despite this diversity",
    ", these should have the same velocity when together during replication .",
    "hence , the issue of velocity selection .",
    "similarly , a repair process is not just a resealing of the y - fork under dna dynamics but has to be closely knit with the repair process .",
    "the specialty of recg comes from the crystal structure which indicates a competition of the closed rings of the wedge domain with the nascent broken pairs of the dna through aromatic interaction@xcite . that both the forward and the backward motions can be handled in the same framework lends credence to the basic hypothesis .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . using a landau type functional to describe the zipped - unzipped coexistence",
    "we formulate the propagating front equation when there is a local perturbation around the interface .",
    "the coupling of recg with the interface is then introduced and the effective dynamics written down .",
    "this strong coupling that can lead to the elastic or diffusive term to change sign , stabilized by a fourth derivative term , is then studied .",
    "this formulation is done in sec ii .",
    "a perturbative approach is used to calculate , via a goldstone mode , the velocity of propagation , the starting point being the zero velocity coexisting phase situation.this is done in sec iii . a numerically exact solution of a discretized version of the model is then presented in sec iv . apart from verification of the predictions of the perturbation theory , nonperturbative effects are also found .",
    "sec v is the summary and conclusion .",
    "we start with the fact that a double - stranded dna in equilibrium below its melting point can show phase coexistence with an interface separating the two phases , the zipped and the unzipped phases .",
    "a helicase ( or its wedge domain mentioned in sec i ) provides the necessary constraint of a fixed distance ensemble to generate the coexistence . to open the dna this interface needs to be translocated .",
