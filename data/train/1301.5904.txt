    "the experimental realization of ultracold quantum gases in ( quasi-)one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometries has stimulated much theoretical research on 1d systems @xcite . in equilibrium , they are particularly interesting because of the enhanced role played by quantum fluctuations . in addition , when taken out of equilibrium , they may exhibit unique behavior such as lack of thermalization @xcite .",
    "we note that ultracold gases are well isolated by the ultra high vacuum in which they are confined , i.e. , their dynamics is to a very good approximation unitary @xcite .",
    "hence , by lack of thermalization we mean the fact that , after perturbing the system and letting it evolve , experimental observables relax to time - independent values that are not described by conventional statistical ensembles",
    ". this effect has been attributed to the proximity to integrable points @xcite , and has motivated an extensive exploration of the dynamics of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the most common dynamics studied in this context are the ones that occur after so - called sudden quenches . in a sudden quench , the initial state @xmath0 is selected to be an eigenstate @xmath1 of an initial hamiltonian @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "then , at time @xmath4 , some parameter(s ) of @xmath2 is(are ) changed instantaneously @xmath5 , and the time evolution is followed under the final ( time - independent ) hamiltonian @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the overlaps of the initial state with the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian .    within this protocol , the time evolution of the expectation value of an observable @xmath10 , @xmath11 , can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 . if the observable relaxes to a time - independent value ( up to fluctuations that vanish , and revival times that diverge , in the thermodynamic limit ) , that value can be computed ( up to corrections that vanish in the thermodynamic limit ) by taking the infinite - time average of eq .",
    ": @xmath14 where we have assumed that there are no degeneracies , or that they can be neglected .",
    "the infinite - time average can be thought of as the prediction of an ensemble , the `` diagonal ensemble '' @xcite , where the density matrix is diagonal in the basis of eigenstates of the final hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath15 is different from the predictions of conventional statistical mechanics ensembles @xcite . among the ( few - body )",
    "observables that have been studied are the density and momentum distribution function of hard - core bosons @xcite , the double occupancy of fermions @xcite , and spin - spin correlations in spin chains @xcite . if one wants to go beyond conventional statistical mechanics ensembles to take into account that nontrivial conserved quantities @xmath16 ( whose number scales polynomially with system size ) are present in integrable systems , and maximizes the entropy under those constraints @xcite , then a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) is obtained @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the gge has been shown to provide the correct description for the previously mentioned observables ( and others ) after relaxation following a sudden quench @xcite .",
    "the ( grand - canonical ) density matrix for the gge can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 $ ] is the partition function , @xmath19 are conserved quantities , and @xmath20 are their corresponding lagrange multipliers .",
    "the latter are computed using that @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the lack of thermalization of few - body observables of interest in integrable systems has been attributed to the failure of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "that is to say that , within a microcanonical window , the matrix elements @xmath22 in an integrable system fluctuate over a finite range of values .",
    "hence , the outcome of the quench dynamics depends on which eigenstates of the final hamiltonian have a finite overlap with the initial state . if the initial state samples the eigenstates within the microcanonical window in an un - bias way , i.e. , `` ergodically , '' then for that initial state the integrable system will thermalize",
    "this does not happen for most quenches between integrable systems studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown to occur for special initial states @xcite with particular entanglement properties @xcite , as well as for initial thermal states at infinite temperature @xcite . in the latter work",
    ", finite temperatures were shown to lead to a bias sampling of the final eigenstates of the hamiltonian after a quench .    in this work ,",
    "we study what happens in quenches from initial states that are eigenstates of an integrable hamiltonian that is nonmappable to a noninteracting one , while the final hamiltonian is integrable and mappable to a noninteracting one .",
    "this is of interest as most studies in the literature have focused on quenches",
    "where both the initial and final hamiltonians are mappable to noninteracting ones .",
    "we also study the case in which the initial state is an eigenstate of a nonintegrable hamiltonian and the final hamiltonian is integrable . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , initial states that are eigenstates of nonintegrable hamiltonians ( away from the edges of the spectrum @xcite ) can lead to thermalization even though the final hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "this can be understood as the two - body interactions that break integrability in models of current interest lead to quantum chaos even in the absence of randomness @xcite , similar to what happens in systems with two - body random interactions @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the eigenstates of nonintegrable hamiltonians become random superpositions of eigenstates of the integrable ones to which the quench is performed , i.e. , they provide the unbiased sampling required for thermalization after a quench to integrability .",
    "we do not find indications that this happens in quenches between the integrable systems studied here .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and describe the quenches to be studied . the observables and ensembles of interest are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : ensembles ] .",
    "the remainder sections are devoted to the discussion of the results for : ( i ) overlaps between initial states and eigenstates of the final hamiltonians ( sec .",
    "[ sec : overlap ] ) , ( ii ) entropies ( sec .",
    "[ sec : entropy ] ) , ( iii ) conserved quantities ( sec .",
    "[ sec : consvquant ] ) , and ( iv ) momentum distribution functions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : momdist ] ) .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we focus our study on 1d lattice hard - core bosons in a box ( a system with open boundary conditions ) with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping @xmath23 and interaction @xmath24 , and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping @xmath25 and interaction @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hard - core boson creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath29 the number operator , and @xmath30 is the lattice size .",
    "in addition to the usual commutation relations @xmath31=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy the constraints @xmath34 , which preclude multiple occupancy of the lattice sites . in what follows ,",
    "the nn hopping parameter sets the energy scale ( @xmath35 ) , we take @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the boltzman constant ) , and the number of particles @xmath38 is selected to be @xmath39 .    for @xmath40 , hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is integrable ( it can be mapped onto the spin-1/2 @xmath41 chain ) @xcite . for @xmath42 ,",
    "it is nonmappable to a noninteracting model .",
    "however , if @xmath43 , one can exactly solve hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) by first mapping it onto the spin-1/2 @xmath44 chain through the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite and then onto noninteracting fermions by means of the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , i.e. , it is mappable to a noninteracting model .",
    "hence , the many - body eigenstates of the fermionic counterpart are slater determinants that can obtained from the single - particle hamiltonian without the need of diagonalizing the many - body one . properties of slater determinants allow one to calculate off - diagonal correlations of hard - core bosons in polynomial time both in the many - body eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xcite and in the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the presence of nonzero nnn terms break the integrability of the model and drive the system to a chaotic regime @xcite .    here , we consider two types of quenches .",
    "quench type i is within integrable models , i.e , we keep @xmath40 at all times , and select the initial state to be an eigenstate of hamiltonian with @xmath45 , while the evolution is studied under hamiltonian with @xmath46 .",
    "quench type ii is from a nonintegrable model to an integrable one : namely , the initial state is selected to be an eigenstate of hamiltonian with @xmath47 while the dynamics is studied under hamiltonian with @xmath48 . in quench type ii , we keep @xmath43 at all times .",
    "note that the final hamiltonian in both types of quenches is the same .",
    "one can fully diagonalize it for large systems by mapping it onto noninteracting fermions as mentioned before . since @xmath42 and @xmath49 are only present in the initial hamiltonian , in what follows we drop the subindex `` @xmath50 '' from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in order to compare results of quenches from eigenstates of different initial hamiltonians , we select the initial states @xmath0 such that after the quench the systems have an energy @xmath53 which always corresponds to that of the canonical ensemble ( ce ) at a fixed temperature @xmath54 ( the temperature is taken to be @xmath55 throughout this work ) .",
    "this means that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ce density matrix , and @xmath58 is the partition function .",
    "the initial states , which are eigenstates of the @xmath23-@xmath24 and @xmath23-@xmath25-@xmath26 models , i.e. , none of which is mappable to a free model , are computed by means of the filtlan package that utilizes a polynomial filtered lanczos procedure @xcite . since",
    "open boundary conditions are imposed , the only remaining symmetry at 1/3 filling , and for @xmath59 , is parity . here , we restrict our analyses to the even parity sector , the dimension of which is about 1/2 of the entire hilbert space .",
    "the largest systems we study have @xmath60 , whose total hilbert space dimension is @xmath61 .",
    "the even parity subspace for those systems has dimension @xmath62 .",
    "this is more than ten times larger than the largest hamiltonian sector diagonalized in previous full exact diagonalization studies of similar systems @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the combination of utilizing the lanczos algorithm for computing the initial state , and full exact diagonalization via the bose - fermi mapping for the final hamiltonian , is what allows us to perform a complete analysis for larger hilbert spaces .",
    "given the fact that the initial states ( @xmath63 ) are pure states , and that the dynamics is unitary , the von neumann entropy is zero at all times . in order to characterize our isolated systems , we make use of the diagonal entropy @xmath64 . it is defined as the von neumann entropy of the diagonal ensemble @xcite , @xmath65 and satisfies all thermodynamic properties expected of an entropy @xcite .",
    "@xmath64 has been recently shown to be consistent with the entropy of thermal ensembles for generic ( nonintegrable ) systems after relaxation @xcite .",
    "similar to the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , we compare the de with the entropy predicted by the ce , the grand - canonical ensemble ( ge ) , and the gge .",
    "namely , we also compute @xmath66 where @xmath67 was defined in eq .  , and @xmath68 , @xmath54 , @xmath38 , and @xmath69 were also defined before . in eq .  ,",

    "we note that while the differences between all those entropies are expected to be finite for any finite system , our goal here is to understand how those differences behave with increasing system size .",
    "as mentioned before , all our quenches share the same final hamiltonian ( @xmath75 ) , which is integrable .",
    "the conserved quantities @xmath16 for the gge in that model are taken to be the occupation number operators of the single particle eigenstates of the fermionic hamiltonian to which hard - core bosons can be mapped . from this selection",
    ", it follows straightforwardly that the corresponding lagrange multipliers can be computed as @xmath76 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that , by construction , the gge has the same distribution of conserved quantities as the diagonal ensemble .",
    "we also calculate the distribution of conserved quantities predicted by the ge , namely , @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "in addition , we study the momentum distribution function of hard - core bosons in the de ( @xmath78 $ ] ) , the ge ( @xmath79 $ ] ) , and the gge ( @xmath80 $ ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 is the diagonal part of the fourier transform of the one - particle density matrix operator @xmath82 , @xmath83 and it was previously studied in systems out of equilibrium with the same @xmath6 in refs .",
    "as mentioned before , in integrable systems , the lack of eigenstate thermalization implies that the distribution of overlaps of the initial state with the eigenstates of final hamiltonian @xmath84 plays a very important role in determining the expectation value of observables after relaxation [ eq .  ] .",
    "therefore , we first study the values of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 in quenches type i and type ii and compare them to the weights of the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian in the ce , @xmath86 .    , and in the ce [ ( d ) and ( h ) ] , @xmath84 and @xmath86 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : coarsegrain](d ) and [ fig : coarsegrain](h ) .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarsegrain ] that , for all values of @xmath24 in quench type i and @xmath87 in quench type ii , the distribution of weights in the de is qualitatively distinct from that in the ce , which shows a simple exponential decay . in the diagonal ensemble ,",
    "the weights between eigenstates that are close in energy fluctuate wildly ( note the logarithmic scale in the @xmath96 axes ) , and a maximum in the values of @xmath84 [ particularly clear in panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ] can be seen around the energy of the initial state after the quench @xmath97 . hence , in contrast to the canonical ensemble , eigenstates of @xmath6 whose energies are close to @xmath67 usually have the largest weights .",
    "this was also seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another feature that is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarsegrain ] is that while the weights @xmath84 decrease rapidly as one moves away from @xmath67 , the number of states with those weights increases dramatically for @xmath98 due to the increase of the density of states .",

    "[ fig : engdistfunc](a)-[fig : engdistfunc](c ) ] , even for the largest @xmath24 , @xmath110 in the diagonal ensemble remains narrower than the energy shell .",

    "this is consistent with the results in refs .",
    "@xcite , which considered a different set of quench protocols and were averaged over different initial states .",
    "note that , in our results , no average has been introduced .    using the breit - wigner function to fit the weighted energy densities for the quenches type i , as well as the weakest quench type ii , is motivated by analytic results obtained in the random two - body interaction model @xcite , and by recent numerical results for models similar to those considered here @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the weighted energy densities ( which were called strength functions ) were computed for the reverse quenches to those considered here , namely , starting from a state @xmath125 that is an eigenstate @xmath126 of an integrable hamiltonian ( in one case , our @xmath6 ) and projecting that state onto the eigenstates @xmath1 of the @xmath23-@xmath24 and @xmath23-@xmath25-@xmath26 hamiltonians ( our @xmath2 ) , i.e. , @xmath127 . in our notation ,",

    "the mean level spacing in the middle is the minimal one , i.e. , the same perturbation may couple more states in that region than away from it . if the average level spacing is the only reason for the difference , then a transition should be seen in our case as one increases the system size even further .",
    "this is a possibility that can not be excluded within the present study .",
    "however , there may be another reason which would make the differences remain in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the result of averaging over eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum @xcite leads to an ensemble at infinite temperature .",
    "in that ensemble , the distribution of the quantities that are conserved after the quench could be featureless .",

    "this is because , for systems with two - body interactions in the absence of randomness , chaotic eigenstates can only be found away from the edges of the spectrum @xcite .",

    "however , the distribution of conserved quantities in those cases was ( trivially ) flat corresponding to infinite temperature systems after the quench .",
    "finally , by studying the momentum distribution function in quenches type i and type ii , we have shown that the conclusions reached on the basis of the results for the energy distributions , entropies , and conserved quantities hold .",
    "namely , we have found no indications that quenches type i lead to the thermalization of this observable while quenches type ii do result in thermal behavior .",
    "we are interested in understanding what happens in the thermodynamic limit for quenches that may have arbitrarily large but finite [ @xmath173 values of @xmath24 or @xmath87 .",
