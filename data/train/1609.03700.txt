    "a large effort is presently under way to study not only heavy- but also light - ion collisions .",
    "this is being motivated by the results obtained in heavy ion collisions like pb - pb and au - au , for the @xmath1/@xmath2 , and also other particle ratios .",
    "it has been conjectured that these indicate a phase change in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "a consistent description of particle production in heavy - ion collisions , up to lhc energies , has emerged during the past two decades using a thermal - statistical model ( referred to simply as thermal model in the remainder of this talk ) .",
    "it is based on the creation and subsequent decay of hadronic resonances produced in chemical equilibrium at unique temperature and baryon chemical potential . according to this picture",
    "the bulk of hadronic resonances made up of the light flavors u , d and s valence quarks are produced in chemical equilibrium .",
    "indeed some particle ratios exhibit very interesting features when studied as a function of the beam energy which deserve attention : ( i ) a maximum in the @xmath1/@xmath2ratio , ( ii ) a maximum in the @xmath3 ratio , ( iii ) no maximum in the @xmath4/@xmath5ratio .",
    "the maxima occur at a center - of - mass energy of around 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the occurrence of these maxima happens in an energy regime where a maximum baryon density occurs  @xcite and a transition from baryon - dominated freeze out to a meson dominated one takes place  @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that these maxima reflect a phase change  @xcite to deconfined state of matter .",
    "the maxima mark a distinction between heavy - ion collisions and p - p collisions as they are not observed in the latter .",
    "this shows a clear difference between the two systems which is worthy of further investigation .",
    "it is the purpose of the present talk to report on an analysis  @xcite studying the transition from a small system like a p - p collision to a large system like a pb - pb or au - au collision and to follow explicitly the genesis of the maxima in certain particle ratios .",
    "a relativistic heavy - ion collision will go through several stages . at one of the later stages ,",
    "the system will be dominated by hadronic resonances .",
    "the identifying feature of the thermal model is that all the resonances as listed by the particle data group  @xcite are assumed to be in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "this assumption drastically reduces the number of free parameters and thus this stage is determined by just a few thermodynamic variables namely , the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath6 , the various chemical potentials @xmath7 determined by the conserved quantum numbers and by the volume @xmath8 of the system . the latter plays no role when considering ratios of yields .",
    "it has been shown that this description is also the correct one  @xcite for a scaling expansion as first discussed by bjorken  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "if the number of particles carrying quantum numbers related to a conservation law is small , then the grand - canonical description no longer holds .",
    "in such a case conservation of quantum numbers has to be implemented exactly in the canonical ensemble  @xcite . in the case",
    "considered here there are two volume parameters : the overall volume of the system @xmath8 , which determines the particle yields at fixed density and the strangeness correlation ( cluster ) volume @xmath9 , which reflects the canonical suppression factor and reduces the densities of strange particles . assuming spherical geometry , the volume @xmath9 is parameterized by the radius @xmath10 which serves as a free parameter and defines the range of local strangeness equilibrium .",
    "according to the thermal model , the baryon chemical potential decreases continuously with increasing beam energy . at the same time",
    "the temperature increases rather quickly until it reaches a plateau . following the rapid rise of the temperature at low beam energies , the @xmath0 and @xmath1/@xmath2also increase rapidly .",
    "this halts when the temperature reaches its limiting value .",
    "however , simultaneously the baryon chemical potential keeps on decreasing .",
    "consequently , the @xmath3 and @xmath1/@xmath2ratios follow this decrease due to strangeness conservation as @xmath1  is produced in associated production together with a @xmath11 . the two effects combined lead to maxima in both cases . for very high energies ,",
    "the baryo - chemical potential no longer plays a role ( @xmath12 ) and the temperature is constant hence these ratios hardly vary  @xcite .    to show this in more detail we present as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : constant ] lines where the @xmath1/@xmath2and the @xmath0 ratios remain constant in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "it should be noted that the maxima of these ratios do not occur in the same position , which remains to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "it is also worth noting that the maxima are not on but slightly above the freeze - out curve .",
    "to consider the case of the collisions of smaller nuclei we have to take into account the strangeness suppression according to the canonical model , i.e.  the concept of strangeness correlation in clusters of a sub - volume @xmath14  @xcite .    a particle with strangeness quantum number",
    "@xmath15 can appear anywhere in the volume @xmath8 but it has to be accompanied by another particles carrying strangeness @xmath16 to conserve strangeness in the correlation volume @xmath9 . assuming spherical geometry , the volume @xmath9 is parameterized by the radius @xmath10 which is a free parameter that defines the range of local strangeness equilibrium .    in the following",
    "we show the trends of various particle ratios as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 and on the beam energy is taken from heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . for p - p collisions slightly different parameters",
    "are more suited  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculations shown give the general trend .",
    "we have ignored the variations of other parameters with system size .",
    "we focus on the system - size dependence of the thermal parameters with particular emphasis on the change in the strangeness correlation radius @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 = 10 fm ( which is the value for central pb - pb collisions ) and @xmath19 = 1 are kept fixed .",
    "the freeze - out values of @xmath6 and @xmath20 will vary with the system size  @xcite , however this has not been taken into account in the present work which aims to give a qualitative description of the effect .",
    "the smaller system size is described by decreasing the value of the correlation radius @xmath10 .",
    "this ensures that strangeness conservation is exact in @xmath21 , and that strangeness production is suppressed with decreasing @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ ratio - p ] we show the energy and system size dependence of two particle ratios calculated along the chemical freeze - out line . in fig .",
    "[ ratio - p ] a maximum is seen in the @xmath1/@xmath22 ratio which gradually disappears when the correlation radius decreases .",
    "a different effect is seen in @xmath23 ratio . here ,",
    "the gradual decrease of the maximum is also seen but , contrarily to the k@xmath24 ratio , it remains quite prominent even for a small correlation radius .",
    "also , the maximum shifts , for smaller systems , towards higher @xmath17 . for pp collisions which correspond to a @xmath10 of about 1.5 fm  @xcite , they will hardly be observed .",
    "it should also be noted that in the thermal model the maxima happen at different beam energies .",
    "it must be emphasized that the results presented here are of a qualitative nature .",
    "in particular there could be changes due to variations with the system size of the temperature and the baryon chemical potential .",
    "in addition the strangeness equilibration volume @xmath9 could be energy dependent and system size dependent .",
    "the thermal model qualitatively describes the presence of maxima in the @xmath1/@xmath2and the @xmath23 ratios at a beam energy of @xmath17@xmath25 10 gev . in this talk",
    "we have described what could possibly happen with different strange particles and pion yields in collisions of smaller systems due to constraints imposed by exact strangeness conservation . in particular",
    ", the @xmath0 ratio still shows a clear maximum even small systems .",
    "the pattern of these maxima is also quite special as they are not always at the same beam energy . +",
