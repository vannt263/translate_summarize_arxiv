    "our theoretical understanding of nature is largely based on perturbative methods . in quantum field theory ,",

    "such calculations are performed at a given order in perturbation theory . in the language of feynman diagrams , lowest order contribution to",
    "the transition amplitude comes from only tree diagrams while higher order terms receive contribution from loop ( virtual ) diagrams also . in literature , higher order contributions to a given transition amplitude are known as radiative corrections",
    ". + computation of virtual diagrams for a given scattering or decay process , involve integration over undetermined loop momenta .",
    "these loop integrals are ill - defined as they may diverge for certain limiting values of momentum flowing in the loop .",
    "a well known case is of ultraviolet singularity which may arise as loop momentum becomes very large . with massless particles present in theory",
    ", these integrals may develop infrared or more appropriately mass singularities , as well .",
    "also , there are singularities which originate from specific phase space points such as physical and anomalous thresholds .",
    "a systematic study of mass singularities and threshold singularities can be done via landau equations .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite kinoshita  @xcite describes mass singularities of feynman amplitudes as pathological solutions of landau equations .",
    "+ in this article , we limit ourselves to the ir singularity of one loop diagrams , away from any threshold . also we do not consider any exceptional phase space point , corresponding to vanishing of any partial sum of external momenta .",
    "according to kinoshita  @xcite , these are pure mass singularities , valid for all possible kinematic invariants made out of external momenta .",
    "these mass singularities can be of soft or collinear type , often described in literature . under certain circumstances , which we will discuss below",
    ", the overlapping of soft and collinear singularities may also take place . in the following ,",
    "we wish to present a pedagogical introduction of occurrence and structure of ir divergence in one loop diagrams . in ref .",
    "this issue is discussed thoroughly , using parametric form of loop integrals .",
    "we have treated the issue at the very elementary level and have show all the features of mass singularities known at one loop .",
    "+ the most general one loop integral is of tensor type , in which loop momentum appears in the numerator .",
    "one loop diagrams having fermions in the loop are common examples of such integrals .",
    "since any tensor integral at one loop can be expressed in terms of scalar ones ( @xmath0 one loop integrals for @xmath1-theory ) , it s sufficient to apply our analysis on scalar integrals only .",
    "these singularities appear as a result of any of the internal lines becoming soft , that is , it s momentum vanishes .",
    "we consider the @xmath2-point scalar integral , fig .",
    "[ fig : loopdiagram ] , in @xmath3-dimensions , given by    @xmath4    with following notations for simplification , @xmath5 in our notation _ @xmath6 _ , always but to start with , _",
    "@xmath7_. now , we wish to derive conditions under which above integral may diverge as one of the internal momenta in the loop , say _",
    "@xmath8 _ becomes soft .",
    "we will take _ @xmath9 _ , with the understanding that soft limit for _ @xmath8 _ is reached as @xmath10 . with _",
    "@xmath9 _ , in our notation , relevant denominators take following form    @xmath11    we have dropped @xmath12 against @xmath13 and @xmath14 , assuming @xmath15 is not orthogonal to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the above denominators vanish under soft limit , if @xmath18    thus in soft limit scalar integral in eq.(1 ) behaves as ,    @xmath19    which diverges logarithmically in @xmath20 . in @xmath21",
    "limit the divergence appears as ln @xmath22 .",
    "kinoshita  @xcite called it @xmath23-singularity .",
    "it is easy to check that no other denominator vanishes in soft limit of @xmath8 , in general .",
    "thus _ the appearance of soft singularity in one loop diagrams is associated with the exchange of massless particles between two on - shell particles_. the structure of soft singularity in eq.(5 ) suggests that it can occur for @xmath24 point functions only .",
    "a text book example of soft singular integral is the one loop vertex correction in qed with massive fermions , as shown in fig.[fig : vertex ] .",
    "at one loop , collinear singularity may appear when one of the internal momenta becomes collinear with a neighboring external leg .",
    "see fig.1 .",
    "we consider    @xmath25    where @xmath26 ( since they correspond to softness of @xmath8 and @xmath27 respectively ) and @xmath28 .",
    "the collinear limit is obtained as @xmath29 . in this case",
    "relevant denominators are ,    @xmath30    the general conditions for these denominators to vanish are    @xmath31    that is , _",
    "one loop diagrams in which a massless external leg meets two massless internal lines may develop collinear divergence_. in - fact , the first of the above three conditions is hidden in the assumption , @xmath28 . in @xmath29 limit , this equality implies    @xmath32    for massive @xmath17 .",
    "thus for collinear limit ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath17 must be massless .",
    "no other denominator vanishes for non - exceptional phase space points .",
    "the scalar integral ( 1 ) , in this limit goes as    @xmath34    which , like soft singularity , is also logarithmically divergent .",
    "this singularity , sometimes referred as @xmath35-singularity can be regularized by setting @xmath36 and taking @xmath21 limit .",
    "it appears as ln @xmath22 , as expected .",
    "we note that a two point function , fig.[fig : bubble ] , can have ir singularity of collinear type only .",
    "now , since we have studied the structure of soft and collinear singularities of a one loop diagram , it is desirable to seek the possibility of their overlap .",
    "a soft piece , with all lines massless , contains two collinear pieces .",
    "let this soft piece be the part of a scalar @xmath2-point function in @xmath3-dimensions .",
    "we set @xmath37 , to write the @xmath2-point scalar integral for massless internal and external lines , keeping only ( in general ) potentially divergent denominators as @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    instead of taking @xmath38 limit right away , which clearly corresponds to soft limit , we wish to break the above integral into soft and collinear regions .",
    "this job is easily done in the light - cone co - ordinates as suggested in ref .  .",
    "in this co - ordinate , a 4-vector is written as @xmath40 where , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a @xmath43-dimensional euclidean vector .",
    "the dot product of two @xmath44-vectors then takes following form    @xmath45    this can easily be generalize in @xmath3-dimensions . in the cm frame of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , using light - cone variables , we may write    @xmath46    here @xmath47 is ( @xmath48 ) dimensional null vector in euclidean space .",
    "now , the integral in eq.(11 ) reads @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "notice that we can make @xmath51 and therefore @xmath8 , collinear to @xmath16 by setting @xmath52 and @xmath53 equal to zero . to do it more systematically , we choose @xmath54 where @xmath55 and take @xmath56 limit in eq.(14 ) , so that the integral becomes    @xmath57    once again we obtain collinear singularity of log - type in @xmath58 .",
    "further , if we take @xmath59 , we make @xmath8 soft and we see the overlapping of soft and collinear singularities , which is also logarithmic in nature .",
    "note that this singularity structure never gets worse for any other choice of @xmath52 made above .",
    "it should be obvious that for non - exceptional phase space points there is no overlapping of two soft regions or two distant collinear regions in a one loop diagram .",
    "thus a one loop ir divergent integral is written as sum of terms , each containing two large - log factors , at most .",
    "in dimensional regularization ( @xmath60 ) , ir singular terms at one loop appear as coefficients of @xmath61 ( soft and/or collinear case ) and @xmath62 ( overlapping case ) .",
    "@xcite in fig.[fig : vertex ] , if we allow fermion lines to be massless , the one loop correction to qed vertex exhibits the full structure of ir divergence at one loop .",
    "we have shown many known features of ir divergence of a one loop diagram , using naive power counting in loop momentum .",
    "we have seen that for a one loop diagram to have ir singularity at least one internal line must be massless .",
    "diagrams with all external legs massive are ir finite for all internal lines massless .",
    "tensor integrals at most retain the ir singular structure of scalar integrals . since maximum three denominators of a general @xmath2-point scalar integral vanish at a time , in infrared regions",
    ", one should expect the possibility of expressing ir singular terms of any one loop diagram ( @xmath63 ) , in terms of those of appropriate three point functions . in ref .",
    ", this expectation is achieved for the most general one loop integrals .",
    "the above analysis also tells us that any one loop diagram is ir finite in @xmath64 dimensions .",
    "this is useful in calculation of certain one loop integrals in @xmath44-dimensions in terms of those in @xmath65-dimensions which certainly contributes to finite part of the integral and can be evaluated numerically ."
