    "the eddington luminosity plays a fundamental role in our understanding of accretion phenomena and , as a consequence , of the agn physics and evolution . in turn , it is also clear that agns played a central role in galaxy formation , as testified by several empirical scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive bhs at the center of stellar spheroids ( i.e. , bulges and elliptical galaxies ) and global properties of the spheroids themselves . in standard treatments eddington luminosity",
    "is calculated by assuming that the electron - photon cross section is well described by the _ electron scattering _ thompson cross section . here",
    "we discuss the modifications to this simple picture by taking into account _",
    "_ opacity also : due to the dependence of emission on the _ square _ of the gas density , it follows that the associated absorption cross section increases _ linearly _ with the gas density , so that eddington luminosity is correspondingly reduced .",
    "it is then expected that this opacity source will be important in the range spanned by _ cold accretion solutions _ ( see , park & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "these high - density conditions were certainly present at the epoch of galaxy formation , thus a quantitative estimate of the reduction of eddington luminosity as a function of ambient gas density and temperature is of direct interest when modeling the early stages of galaxy formation ( see , e.g. , haiman , ciotti & ostriker 2003 ) . in the following discussion",
    "we often refer to formulae provided in ciotti , ostriker & pellegrini ( 2003 , hereafter cop ) : eq .",
    "( 1 ) there will be indicated as cop1 , and so on .",
    "let @xmath0 be the bolometric luminosity associated with an accretion rate of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the accretion efficiency and @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "the _ momentum transfer _ to the gas electrons per unit time , frequency and volume at the radius @xmath4 is given by ( e.g. , see krolik 1999 ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of photon  electron interactions as given in cop1 , @xmath7 is the electron number density , @xmath8 is the planck constant , and @xmath9 is the total electron cross  section corresponding to the various absorption processes ( e.g. , see krolik 1999 ) .",
    "for simplicity we restrict to the _ optically thin regime _ : as a consequence , from now on we assume @xmath10 ( see cop ) . the net acceleration field experienced by the accreting gas with density profile @xmath11",
    "is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant . by imposing @xmath14 one obtains @xmath15 when",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 , the classical expression for @xmath18 is recovered .",
    "here we consider two different opacity sources for the emitted photons .",
    "the first is due to _ electron scattering _ as described by the klein ",
    "nishina cross section @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see cop2 ) .",
    "the second is due to _ free  free _ absorption : its cross cross section @xmath22 is obtained from the emission formula ( per unit volume , frequency , over the solid angle , spitzer 1978 , hereafter s78 ) @xmath23 and the _ kirchhoff s law _",
    "@xmath24 , where @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant . accordingly ,",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean _ free - free gaunt factor_. we assume that a mass fraction @xmath29 of the accreting material is made of fully ionized hydrogen , and the remaining fraction @xmath30 by fully ionized helium .",
    "thus , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and finally @xmath35 . _ in other words , at variance with the standard electron scattering case , @xmath22 depends ( linearly ) on the gas density_. as in cop , we also adopt a ( normalized ) spectral distribution made by the sum of _ two _ distinct contributions @xmath36 @xmath37 describes a ( normalized ) _",
    "double - slope _ , non thermal distribution of total luminosity @xmath38 , with low and high - frequency slopes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , and break frequency @xmath41 ( cop9 ) .",
    "@xmath42 is a normalized _ black  body _ distribution of temperature @xmath43 and total luminosity @xmath44 ( cop10 ) ; thus @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , we study @xmath46 we now compute the four integrals appearing in eq .",
    "( 6 ) for some representative values of the parameters entering @xmath47 . as in cop",
    ", we fix @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , so reproducing the observed compton temperature in quasar spectra ( see , e.g. , krolik 1999 ; sazonov , ostriker & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath51 as a very good fit over the range @xmath52 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath53 is trivial : in fact , the 99% of @xmath54 is emitted at @xmath55 for any reasonable value of @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath56 , and from the normalization condition @xmath57 we then obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and the dimensionless integral equals @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . note that if @xmath63 then the integral equals 1 ; moreover , @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "thus we have @xmath68 where temperatures are in kelvin , and we assumed @xmath69 ( see s78 ) .",
    "the integral @xmath70 is affected by a formal infrared divergency if ( as in our case ) @xmath71 with @xmath72 : in fact , @xmath73 for @xmath74 . in order to have a proper physical description",
    "we integrate only at frequencies @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the plasma frequency . under the condition @xmath77",
    ", the opacity contribution comes mainly from the rayleigh - jeans regime in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and the asymptotic value of the integral is @xmath78 thus , if @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath63 we obtain @xmath82 for @xmath83 k the free - free opacity contribution to eddington luminosity is fully dominated by the low frequency tail in the non - thermal spectral distribution . for example , a reduction factor of eddington luminosity of the order of 10 is obtained for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , when @xmath86 k and @xmath87 k , respectively .",
    "of course , the present analysis leaves open several questions , such as the astrophysical status of the high - density gas at low temperatures , the characteristic linear scale over which the gas becomes optically thick , and the detailed shape of the non - thermal radiation distribution in agns at ( very ) low frequencies .",
    "all these aspects of the problem should be proprerly addressed when applying the present results to numerical models .",
