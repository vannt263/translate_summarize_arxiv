    "photoinduced production of @xmath2 pairs is a relatively new topic in particle physics . nevertheless ,",
    "since modern @xmath3 photon detectors in combination with high intensity photons beams have become available , a large amount of data , primarily angular and momentum distributions have been measured .",
    "the production of the meson pairs is sensitive to sequential decays of baryon resonances such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence , @xmath2 meson pair production is a complementary tool to study nucleon and @xmath6 excitation spectra providing additional information compared to single @xmath7 or @xmath8 photoproduction .",
    "remarkably , till now no major disagreements between experimental data and state - of - the - art model predictions for the @xmath0 reaction have been observed .",
    "the main reason for this is due to the fact that this reaction seems to be dominated by just a single partial - wave amplitude .",
    "several independent studies @xcite agree with the assumption that the @xmath0 reaction mainly proceeds via excitation of the @xmath1 amplitude with a moderate admixture of positive parity resonances and generally insignificant contributions from nonresonant born terms . as a consequence ,",
    "even though the models differ from each other in detail , they provide similar results for many observables . in order to disentangle small components in the reaction amplitude , it is therefore important to study spin observables which are especially sensitive to interference terms .",
    "the situation is similar to single @xmath9 photoproduction at energies up to @xmath10 , which is dominated by the magnetic @xmath11 multipole amplitudes due to the excitation of the @xmath12 resonance or single @xmath8 production close to threshold , which is dominated by the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the possibility of model independent partial - wave analysis of a so - called `` complete '' set of measurements is often one of the main motivations given for polarization measurements .",
    "such a `` complete experiment , '' which is a complex and extensive task for single meson photoproduction , is even more difficult for reactions in which two mesons are emitted .",
    "however , in some cases it is possible to study the partial wave content using a restricted number of observables , making some physically reasonable general assumptions about the production mechanisms . some polarization observables for @xmath14 were already measured and analyzed in earlier papers @xcite . here",
    "we report the first measurements of asymmetries obtained using a transversely polarized proton target .",
    "our main objectives are to check the consistency of the experimental target and beam - target asymmetry data with the dominant @xmath15 production mechanism and to investigate small contributions from partial waves other than the dominant @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "the general formalism for photoproduction of two pseudoscalar mesons on nucleons has been developed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , where the formulas for different polarization observables are presented . in the expressions below",
    ", we denote the final state particles as 1 , 2 , and 3 and consider the particle selection @xmath16 , with reference to the coordinate system presented in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the results are presented for three independent particle sets , corresponding to the numbering @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . in each case the @xmath20 axis is directed along the photon momentum .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes are chosen such that the momentum of particle 1 has a positive @xmath21 projection and is orthogonal to the @xmath22 axes .",
    "as independent kinematical variables we choose angles @xmath23 of particle 1 in the overall center - of - mass ( cm ) system , together with angles @xmath24 of particle 2 in the cm system of the pair @xmath25 and their corresponding invariant mass @xmath26 .",

    "table[ta1 ] schematically explains how these asymmetries are separated by a proper variation of the photon and proton polarization parameters .",

    "for the interpretation of our results we adopted an isobar model approach as used , for example , for double pion photoproduction in refs.@xcite .",
    "the main ingredients are described in detail in refs.@xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to a brief overview needed for the discussion below .",
    "the reaction amplitude @xmath38 contains background and resonance terms @xmath42 where each resonance state @xmath43 is determined by spin - parity @xmath44 and isospin @xmath45 .",
    "the resonance sector [ diagrams ( g ) and ( h ) in fig.[fig_diagr ] ] includes only the states with isospin @xmath46 .",
    "as already noted , analysis of the existing data for @xmath0 is in general agreement with the assumption that in the energy region @xmath47 gev the reaction is dominated by the @xmath48 partial wave . in the present model , the latter",
    "is populated by the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states .",
    "the resonance @xmath50 was introduced into the reaction @xmath0 in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was needed in order to maintain the importance of the @xmath48 wave at energies above 1.3 gev , which otherwise would rapidly decrease with increasing energy .",
    "other @xmath46 resonances entering the amplitude are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .    according to the isobar model concept",
    ", each resonance state @xmath55 generates the final @xmath56 state via intermediate transitions to @xmath57 and @xmath58 configurations . in this respect the resonance terms @xmath59 in ( [ tbr ] )",
    "are given by a coherent sum of two amplitudes , @xmath60 where the isobars @xmath61 and @xmath62 are denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "each term in ( [ t12 ] ) has the form @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the total center - of - mass energy .",
    "the quantities @xmath66 are helicity functions determining the transition @xmath67 .",
    "the propagators @xmath68 were calculated in the nonrelativistic form @xmath69 the total energy dependent width @xmath70 is a sum of the partial decay widths in @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 channels : @xmath74 the latter two , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , were calculated with explicit inclusion of the finite widths of the @xmath6 and @xmath63 isobars .",
    "finally , the functions @xmath77 in eq.([talpha ] ) depending on the three - momenta of the final particles describe decays of the resonances into the final @xmath78 state . as adjustable parameters the breit - wigner masses @xmath79 , as well as",
    "the products @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , were used in @xcite .",
    "the total widths of resonances were not varied .",
    "the closeness of the resonances to the @xmath82 production threshold , especially of @xmath83 , results in rather weak sensitivity of the cross section to their widths .",
    "therefore the values of the total widths at the resonance position @xmath84 were taken directly from the particle data group ( pdg ) compilation @xcite or from the references cited there .",
    "for the same reason , the masses of the resonances , rated by four or three stars , were varied around their pdg values .    the slowly varying background @xmath85 is presented in fig.[fig_diagr ] by the diagrams ( a ) to ( f ) .",
    "only those diagrams were taken into account whose contribution is appreciable .",
    "we have omitted , for example , the terms with @xmath6 and @xmath63 isobars in the @xmath86 channel .",
    "the diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) contain the unknown coupling constants in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 vertices .",
    "since the corresponding terms have rather small impact on the calculation results , these constants were not treated as adjustable parameters and just for simplicity were fixed according to the prescription @xmath89 as the direct calculation in @xcite shows , the background terms do not contribute significantly to the cross section .",
    "the @xmath82 system is assumed not to resonate in the energy region considered .",
    "the validity of this assumption is confirmed by the results of ref.@xcite where the contribution of the resonance @xmath90 at energies @xmath47 gev is shown to be less than 1@xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , the model does not contain relative phases in the electromagnetic couplings which are sometimes used in the multipole analyses .",
    "although these phases allow one to make the phenomenological formulation more flexible , their inclusion leads to unnecessary increase of the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "the experiment was performed at the mami c accelerator in mainz@xcite using the glasgow - mainz tagged photon facility@xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons were produced by scattering a longitudinally polarized electron beam with an energy of 1557 mev and a polarization degree of 80% on a 10-@xmath92m - thick copper radiator .",
    "the photons are energy tagged by momentum analysis of the scattered electrons in the dipole magnet spectrometer .",
    "the resulting energy - tagged photon beam covered an energy range from 450 to 1450 mev with an average resolution of 4 mev .",
    "the polarization degree of the electron beam was measured periodically using mott scattering at the laser - driven source .",
    "the beam helicity was switched randomly , with a frequency of 1 hz , during the experiment and the orientation of the polarization vector at the radiator position was checked using moeller scattering . in the bremsstrahlung process , the longitudinal polarization of the electrons is transferred to the circular polarization of the emitted photons @xcite .",
    "the degree of circular photon polarization @xmath28 depends on the photon energy and varied from 67% at 1050 mev to 79% at 1450 mev .",
    "the reaction @xmath93 was measured using the crystal ball ( cb ) central spectrometer @xcite with taps @xcite as a forward angle spectrometer .",
    "the full detector setup is shown schematically in fig.[fig2_2 ] .",
    "the spherical cb detector consisted of 672 optically insulated nai(tl ) crystals with a thickness of 15.7 radiation lengths pointing towards the center of the sphere .",
    "the crystals were arranged in two hemispheres covering 93% of the full solid angle .",
    "electromagnetic showers were reconstructed with an energy resolution of @xmath94 at 1 gev .",
    "shower directions were measured with a resolution of @xmath95 in the polar and @xmath96 in the azimuthal angle . for charged - particle identification via differential energy loss , a barrel of 24 thin scintillation detectors surrounding the target was used @xcite .",
    "the forward angular range @xmath97 was covered by the taps calorimeter @xcite , arranged as a planar configuration of 384 hexagonally shaped baf@xmath98 detectors .",
    "each detector had an inner diameter of 5.9 cm and was 25 cm long , which corresponds to 12 radiation lengths .",
    "the resolutions for the reconstruction of electromagnetic showers , were @xmath99 for the energy and @xmath100 for the direction .",
    "a 5-mm thick plastic scintillator in front of each module allows the separation of neutral and charged particles .",
    "photons ( or electrons ) and hadrons can be separated by a pulse - shape analysis based on the properties of @xmath101 .",
    "the crystals have the fast and long components of the scintillation , the intensity of which depends on the incident particle nature .",
    "analysis of these components gives us an additional method of particle identification .",
    "the best way to identify the charged particle species in taps is a time - of - flight versus cluster energy analysis .",
    "the solid angle of the combined crystal ball and taps detection system is nearly @xmath102 of @xmath3 sr .",
    "the transversely polarized target protons were provided by a frozen - spin butanol ( @xmath103 ) target @xcite .",
    "a four - layer saddle coil provided a 0.45  t holding field perpendicular to the beam axis at a current of 35 a. a @xmath104 dilution refrigerator keeps the target material at a temperature of 25 mk which corresponds to relaxations times of 1500  h. the 2-cm - long and 2-cm - diameter cylindrical target cell was filled with 2-mm - diameter butanol spheres with a packing fraction ( filling factor ) of @xmath105 .",
    "the target polarization was measured using the nmr techniques at the beginning and the end of each data taking period .",
    "the polarization was then calculated for each individual data file from the known exponential relaxation of the polarization . in order to reduce the systematic uncertainties , the direction of the target polarization vector was regularly reversed during the experiment .",
    "the average degree of polarization during the beam periods may - june 2010 and april 2011 was @xmath106 .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath107 reaction is based on the two photon decays of the @xmath9 and the @xmath8 meson as described in detail in ref.@xcite . as a first step ,",
    "events with four neutral and one or zero charged particles in the crystal ball and taps detectors were selected . the distribution of invariant masses , calculated from all possible combinations of the four neutral hits is shown in fig.[fig2 ] . as there are three independent combinations of possible pairs , this histogram has three entries per event .",
    "the distribution shows already large peak corresponding to the @xmath108 channel and two smaller ones from the @xmath2 final state . in the next step ,",
    "a @xmath109 for both possible final states , @xmath110 and @xmath2 , was calculated for each possible permutation of the four neutral hits : @xmath111 here @xmath112 and @xmath113 are @xmath9 and @xmath8 masses and @xmath114 mev and @xmath115 mev are the corresponding invariant mass resolutions of the detector system .",
    "each event was then assigned to either @xmath108 or @xmath2 production depending on the minimum of the @xmath109 values .",
    "further selection is based on selections in the invariant @xmath116 mass distributions and the @xmath117 missing mass calculated with the assumption of a @xmath118 initial state and the reconstructed @xmath15 pair .    in principle",
    ", the polarization observables in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be determined in each photon energy , angular or invariant mass @xmath26 bin as count rate asymmetries from the number @xmath119 of reconstructed @xmath120 events with different orientations of target spin and beam helicity : @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the orientation of the target polarization vector @xmath126 relative to the normal of the production plane and @xmath127 is given by the product of the beam helicity @xmath128 and the orientation of @xmath126 relative to the @xmath21 axis . in these asymmetries , systematic uncertainties related to the total photon flux normalization and the target filling factor cancel . however , using a butanol target has one essential disadvantage due to additional background from reactions on @xmath129 and @xmath130 nuclei . in the numerators of eqs .",
    "( [ npx])-([npyc ] ) , this background cancels because the nucleons bound in @xmath129 or @xmath130 are unpolarized .",
    "however , in order to determine the denominator , this contribution has to be taken into account .",
    "the detection of the outgoing protons and applying kinematic constraints already suppress this background significantly . in order to subtract the remaining background we analyzed @xmath2 photoproduction on pure carbon and liquid hydrogen targets .",
    "the corresponding @xmath117 distributions were scaled and added in order to fit the corresponding distribution obtained with the butanol target . since the magnitude and the shape of the background depend on the initial beam energy and on the momenta of the final particles , this procedure was performed for each individual kinematical bin .",
    "this subtraction method is illustrated on fig.[fig3 ] for two photon energies , which are typical for the presented data analysis .",
    "missing mass spectra for the reaction @xmath93 with the butanol target are shown by the full black circles .",
    "spectra measured with the hydrogen and carbon targets are represented by the green triangles and the blue squares respectively .",
    "their absolute values were scaled to fit the butanol data .",
    "the red open circles represent the sum of the fitted hydrogen and carbon contributions .",
    "for further analysis only events around the proton peak , within the vertical lines , are used .",
    "the intervals were selected to optimize the signal - to - background ratio . even in the distribution from the pure hydrogen ( green triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] still some background remains .",
    "this is mainly due to misidentified @xmath131 reactions , split or overlapping photon clusters , and combinatoric mixing .",
    "this background is subtracted by fitting the missing mass distributions with the sum of a gaussian and a third - order polynomial function . after subtracting the polynomial background ,",
    "the distribution is found to be in excellent agreement with results of a monte carlo simulation of the @xmath132 reaction ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "the average detection efficiency for the @xmath133 reaction after all analysis steps is about 50% for beam energies from 1.05 to 1.45 gev .",
    "the asymmetries in each photon energy , angular or invariant mass @xmath26 bin were obtained as count rate asymmetries by integrating the reaction yields in eqs .",
    "( 9)-(12 ) over four remaining variables .",
    "this procedure is exactly valid if the acceptance does not depend on any of these variables .",
    "however , a small and smooth variation of the acceptance can be taken into account in the systematic uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig_eff ] shows as an example the efficiency as function of those kinematic variables where the strongest variation of the acceptance is observed .",
    "the typical variation is less then 3% .",
    "the influence of the acceptance variations and background subtraction on the asymmetries was estimated by varying the applied selection criteria .",
    "the observed changes in the asymmetries by 3%-6% were smaller than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "other systematic uncertainties of the present measurement are related to the determination of the proton polarization ( 4% ) and the beam polarization ( 2% ) . by adding all contributions in quadrature , a total systematic uncertainty of less than 8% was obtained .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , and [ fig6 ] show the measured asymmetries as function of the various scattering angles and invariant mass combinations .    data from the @xmath134 analysis are shown in columns 1 and 4 .",
    "the @xmath135 and @xmath136 data are shown in columns @xmath137 and in columns @xmath138 , respectively . in this section",
    "we present a qualitative description of the reaction properties revealed by our data . a detailed partial wave analysis of the new data has started and will be published elsewhere .",
    "as one can see in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , both @xmath35 and @xmath139 have rather small values , except for @xmath140 which strongly varies with pion angle ( see first column in fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "this dependence can be described to a good approximation by an odd function with a maximum amplitude of about 0.8 .",
    "this peculiar behavior is a direct signature of @xmath141-wave production of the @xmath72 configuration in the @xmath142 state . as noted in sec.[intro ] this partial wave appears to dominate the reaction amplitude in a wide energy region from threshold to @xmath143 gev @xcite . assuming that the reaction proceeds exclusively via the formation of an intermediate @xmath72 pair in the @xmath144 partial wave , one obtains the following simple form for @xmath36 in the region of @xmath83 : @xmath145 where @xmath66 ( @xmath146 ) are the helicity amplitudes for the transition @xmath147 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath148 @xcite eq .",
    "( 13 ) reduces to the simpler approximation @xmath149 the function ( [ func1 ] ) reaches its maximum value @xmath150 at @xmath151 , in general agreement with our data ( see red dotted lines in the first column in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that , in the same @xmath141-wave hypothesis of @xmath72 production , the behavior of @xmath152 should be similar ( up to the possible change of sign ) to that of the observable @xmath39 for single @xmath9 photoproduction in the @xmath6 resonance region . indeed , assuming that the @xmath61 excitation is a pure magnetic dipole transition the distribution @xmath153 has the form @xmath154 so that , as in the case of @xmath36 [ see eq .",
    "( 13 ) ] , the angular dependence of @xmath39 is mainly governed by the factor @xmath155 .    concerning the role of positive parity states , two important facts can be observed .",
    "first , the dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the invariant mass @xmath26 is determined exclusively by an interference of partial wave amplitudes with opposite parities .",
    "the simple model with only the @xmath1 amplitude therefore gives the trivial result @xmath156 second , if only the dominant @xmath1 wave is included , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are odd functions of @xmath157 @xmath158 and reach zero at @xmath159 . in this respect",
    ", the nonzero values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath159 as well as of their distribution over the invariant mass @xmath26 may be viewed as a signature of the presence of partial waves with positive parity . however , as evident from figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] the deviation of the measured values from the simple rules ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) is small , indicating that the role of states besides @xmath1 is not large .",
    "this is in full agreement with our previous results for the unpolarized angular distribution @xcite as well as for the helicity beam asymmetry @xcite .    the solid lines in figs.[fig4]-[fig6 ]",
    "show the prediction of the isobar model described in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "here we use the parameter set ( i ) ( see table i in ref.@xcite ) which was preferred since it gives the best description of the measured linear beam asymmetry @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "this solution also reproduces the invariant mass distributions measured in @xcite ( see fig.9 in ref.@xcite ) and describes reasonably well the data for the beam asymmetries @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted lines in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show predictions of the bonn - gatchina multichannel fit @xcite ( solution bg2011 - 02 ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where only the data for @xmath0 were fitted , within the bonn - gatchina approach , the positions of resonances , their partial decay widths , and relative strengths were fitted simultaneously to the data sets in different channels , including single and double meson production as well as strangeness production .",
    "the application to the reaction @xmath0 is described in detail in ref.@xcite . in this analysis some contributions from @xmath63 resonances , which do not enter the amplitude in @xcite , in particular the @xmath164 , are also included .",
    "both models describe the new data equally well .",
    "the present statistics do not allow any discrimination between the different model predictions in kinematic regions where they show small differences , e.g. , at low values of @xmath165 .",
    "the other two observables @xmath34 and @xmath37 contribute exclusively to the distribution of the cross section over the azimuthal angle @xmath166 and vanish in the distribution over @xmath167 and @xmath26 . in fig.[fig6 ]",
    "we show data for the particle selection @xmath168 . as in ref.@xcite the denominators of the asymmetries",
    "are averaged over the whole @xmath169 region .",
    "parity conservation requires @xmath170 using angular momentum algebra it can be shown that if only the states with @xmath171 enter the amplitude ( in our case @xmath172 resonances ) the product @xmath173 , for both @xmath174 and @xmath175 , is proportional to @xmath176 and does not contain higher order harmonics .",
    "the presence of states with positive parity leads to a more complicated shape for these observables , as observed in our data .",
    "we have presented the first experimental results for the target and the beam - target asymmetries of the @xmath0 cross section obtained with circularly polarized photons and transversely polarized protons .",
    "the measurements were performed using crystal ball and taps spectrometers .",
    "we presented a qualitative analysis which shows that the new data for all four observables are in broad agreement with the dominance of the @xmath1 amplitude , confirming the theoretical interpretation of previous measurements @xcite and other analyses @xcite , in the region below @xmath143gev .",
    "however , the detailed distributions of the measured observables are sensitive to the contribution of small components in the reaction amplitude . specifically an interference between @xmath1 and the positive parity amplitudes @xmath177 and",
