    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lambda ] ) is solved for the representative values of intraband interaction @xmath65 = 0.5 ev and interband interaction @xmath66 = 0.5 ev , which yield maximal eigenvalues @xmath67 and 2.5 for all three systems in the order discussed , and the corresponding pairing eigenfunctions are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a - f in a blue to red colormap at the fermi momenta for two representative @xmath68 cuts ( the results are also consistent with other @xmath68 cuts and interaction values ) . the first point to notice </S>",
    "<S> is that there is no clear four - fold symmetry breaking in @xmath50 , which excludes the presence of any significant @xmath2-wave pairing component . in the supplementary material , </S>",
    "<S> we give a detailed fit of the computed @xmath50 with an @xmath18 gap function including higher harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates that the @xmath68 dependence of @xmath50 is weak , and also the presence of second and higher harmonics is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find the expected result that the gap anisotropy is largest in band 2 , and then reduces gradually in band 1 , 4 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected from the @xmath18-pairing symmetry as the gap maxima lie at the @xmath20 and m points with opposite signs .    </S>",
    "<S> next we study the relative strength of various possible pairing channels , and the contributions from each band . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a dimensionless pairing strength by projecting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lambda ] ) onto a gap function @xmath69 with given symmetry @xmath70 or d@xmath71 ( denoted by @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 with its total value being @xmath74 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 is the fermi velocity at momentum @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of @xmath77 can be gained qualitatively by studying the peaks in @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant pairing potential @xmath78 is governed mainly by the peaks of @xmath79 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] at @xmath80 , because they stabilize the gap function that satisfies the condition @xmath81 at a maximum number of momenta to yield the largest positive pairing strength @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> since the dominant peak in @xmath82 is determined by the fs scattering enhancement ( or equivalently fs nesting ) due to spin fluctuations , the relative strength of pairing symmetry with respect to others depends only on the strength of fs nesting , and is very much insensitive to the specific values of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we perform the pairing strength calculation for a realistic range of interaction values and draw conclusions based on the robust result from the overall phase diagrams . based on the prior knowledge from other systems @xcite , we know that the intra - band interaction , denoted by @xmath84 , favors @xmath2-wave pairing while the inter - band interaction , @xmath85 , enhances the @xmath18-wave pairing , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are intra- and inter - band susceptibilities with @xmath88 in these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4]g - l show the total pairing strength @xmath64 for @xmath2-wave ( left column ) and @xmath18-wave pairing ( right column ) for three pu - based superconductors ( in three horizontal rows ) as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the entire phase diagram </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore predict that the @xmath18-wave pairing dominates over the @xmath2-wave pairing for all three materials by as large as an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also observe that the value of @xmath64 is maximum in pucoga@xmath12 , which is consistent with its measured value of sc transition temperature @xmath3 .    to further delineate the reasons for having a strong @xmath18-wave pairing channel , we investigate the contributions of each band and the hot - spot wavevector in fig .  [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we recall the relevant facts pertaining to the fs topology discussed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] that the dominant fs instability , which also induces the leading pairing instability , commences between bands 1 and 2 to bands 3 and 4 [ connected by wavevector @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the sign reversal of the pairing states , which is essential for yielding positive @xmath64 , occurs only in the inter - band components between bands 1,2 and bands 3,4 for the @xmath18-wave pairing symmetry ( not for intra - band except band 2 or between bands 1 and 2 , or 3 and 4 ) , while for the @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry both intra- and inter - band components contribute . </S>",
    "<S> these facts manifest themselves in the value of @xmath90 , plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . for the @xmath18-wave pairing </S>",
    "<S> , finite positive pairing strength thus occurs for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , while the others contribute negative or small pairing strength . because these pairing components are supported by the strong fs scattering enhancements , the total pairing strength @xmath64 eventually gains a positive and large value . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario should be contrasted with the @xmath2-wave pairing , in which the total @xmath64 is positive but smaller in amplitude lest all components of @xmath77 ( except @xmath95 in the @xmath96-plane ) contributing positive values . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the @xmath2-wave pairing , breaking @xmath44 symmetry , obtains sign reversal in each quadrant of the brillouin zone , thus the momentum sum in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) amounts to a lower amplitude in @xmath64 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18-wave pairing channel causes fairly isotropic and single - sign pairing in each band ( except in band 2 , which cuts through the nodal plane ) , and thus contributes large phase space of positive values in the momentum sum . </S>",
    "<S> these are the key reasons why the nodal @xmath18-wave pairing is favored over the @xmath2-wave pairing channel , although both pairing symmetries attain positive values , and are possible contenders for unconventional superconductivity in the pu-115 family . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier , the @xmath42- or @xmath43-wave pairing symmetries also obtain positive @xmath64 , but much weaker in strength and thus are losing contenders in these systems </S>",
    "<S> .    * magnetic resonance mode and signatures of pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> * we present experimentally verifiable signatures for both dominant pairing symmetries . in this context , the magnetic resonance mode is widely considered to be a deciding feature for unconventional pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a well defined spin resonance is observed in cuprates  @xcite , iron pnictides  @xcite , and ce - based heavy fermions@xcite , which is located at characteristic energy and momentum in the sc state . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown by yu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the resonance energy scales almost linearly with the sc gap in all these materials , suggesting further that the magnetic resonance mode is indeed a feedback effect of the unconventional gap symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this universal scaling , we study the evolution of the magnetic excitation spectrum of both sc states and evaluate their characteristics to guide experimental detection .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic resonance spectrum in the sc state of single - band and multiband systems is well studied within the bcs theory  @xcite . a generalization to the dft band structure </S>",
    "<S> is obtained here ( see supplementary material for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic collective mode is a manifestation of many - body interactions , which is captured within the bcs - rpa framework . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the rpa formulas remain the same as before , while the bare susceptibility is replaced by the bcs susceptibility which involves additional terms coming from particle - particle , and hole - hole scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic resonance calculation uses the full bcs - rpa susceptibility as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , to obtain a qualitative understanding of the fundamental energy and momentum scale of the resonance , one can use a simplified expression to estimate the resonance condition @xmath97 , given that @xmath98 = - { \\rm sgn}[\\delta^m_{{\\bf k}_f+{\\bf q}}]$ ] , where @xmath99 are those fermi hot - spots , which provide strong nesting for wavevector @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis has been successfully used before for cuprates  @xcite and pnictides  @xcite , with its quantitative value and intensity subject to the details of the band structure and the orbital overlap of matrix - element parameters .    clearly , the condition for having a strong resonance mode has the same underlying mechanism as that of the positive pairing strength discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the aforementioned discussion , we thus expect to have spin resonance in the vicinity of @xmath100 , which involves a sign reversal in both @xmath2-wave and @xmath18-wave pairing symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> our results of magnetic resonance spectra are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] for both pairing symmetries . as for the value of @xmath64 in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the magnetic excitation spectrum is weaker and more spread out over the momentum space for the @xmath2-wave pairing case , while it is substantially more localized around @xmath31 with maximum intensity shifted towards @xmath101 for the @xmath18-wave pairing case . to affirm our statement , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] we plot the total @xmath102 ( the energy axis is normalized by the sc gap amplitude to perform a comparative study between different materials with different @xmath3 ) along the diagonal direction and at five representative @xmath30 cuts . </S>",
    "<S> also the single - momentum cuts at @xmath103 are plotted for both pairing symmetries with different colormaps distinguishing different @xmath30 values in the middle column , while different rows are for different materials . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see the so - called localized collective mode for the @xmath18-wave pairing in both pucoin@xmath12 , pucoga@xmath12 , but not in purhga@xmath12 system . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction of the ratio @xmath1040.5 - 0.75 is in reasonable agreement with universal scaling@xcite and can be verified by inelastic neutron scattering measurements , which has the ability to detect both the energy and momentum resolved collective @xmath105 spin excitations . </S>",
    "<S> + * pcs results . * to elaborate on the spectroscopic fingerprints of both pairing symmetries , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate their respective pcs spectra using the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) formalism  @xcite generalized to multiband systems with anisotropic fss and sc order parameters  @xcite , see supplementary materials . in order to keep the problem tractable </S>",
    "<S> , we consider only normal incidence of electrons from the metallic tip and neglect interband transitions as well as fermi velocity mismatch between the tip and the pu-115 compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] and compared with available conductance data for pucoga@xmath12  @xcite in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7]b . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for both nodal @xmath2-wave and @xmath18-wave pairing symmetries , the calculated conductance spectrum exhibits a characteristic zero - bias conductance peak , which marks the presence of nodes and the hallmark of andreev bound states . to contrast these results </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate the pcs spectrum for isotropic ( nodeless ) @xmath106-wave pairing ( green line ) which shows a suppressed andreev reflection signal for finite interface barrier potential . for a reasonable parameter choice of @xmath49=10 mev , interface transparency coefficient @xmath107=1.55 , and a rotation angle @xmath108 ( of the crystallographic @xmath109 axis with respect to the normal of the interface ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can fit the experimental data very well with nodal @xmath18-wave pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is not impossible to fit the data with @xmath2-wave with another parameter choice even in this realistic multiband model . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that pcs conductance data are consistent with nodal gap functions , but can not unequivocally determine the locations of nodes </S>",
    "<S> .    * outlook . * obtaining a consistent theory of unconventional superconductivity , which can describe cuprate , pnictide , organic , heavy - fermion , as well as actinide superconductors has a pressing need . </S>",
    "<S> considerable consistency is achieved so far in all three former families of superconductors  @xcite in terms of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity , pairing symmetry , and magnetic resonance mode , which motivated us to perform these studies in the actinide family . </S>",
    "<S> here we provided the first dft - based spin - fluctuation calculation of the pair symmetry in the three - dimensional , multiband actinide superconductor family and find the surprising result of the dominant @xmath18-wave pairing symmetry with a nodal gap , and not the so often assumed @xmath2-wave gap . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback effect of this unconventional pairing yields a strong magnetic resonance mode , which can be tested in future inelastic neutron scattering measurements . in the past , the @xmath2-wave gap was mostly proposed because it was the simplest scenario based on a single band that could explain power laws in the low - temperature behavior of specific heat , spin - lattice - relaxation rate , and magnetic penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> of course , gap nodes on the fs have a profound influence on electronic excitations and the formation of andreev bound states , which provide a natural explanation of the observed zero - bias conductance peak in the point - contact spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the observed zero - bias conductance peak can be fit equally well with the nodal @xmath18-wave pairing symmetry as shown here . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the nodal @xmath18-wave pairing symmetry will also provide insight into the physics of iron - pnictide superconductors , which are believed to host unconventional pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we envisage that further studies of this actinide family of unconventional multiorbital superconductors will advance the lofty goal of obtaining a unified spin - fluctuation picture of superconductivity .    </S>",
