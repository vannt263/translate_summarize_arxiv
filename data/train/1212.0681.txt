    "one solves a linear system of differential equations for @xmath0 to define the probability of having the given numbers of molecules at time t. the cme is a linear equation , like the shroedinger equation for the wave function .",
    "we assume that the system does not interact with the environment , and during the measurement we observe just some collection of integers for the different types of molecules , defined by probabilities @xmath2 .    while the numerical solution of cme is possible using the gilepsee algorithm , the analytical investigation of cme is very important .",
    "the problem was solved exactly in the infinite system size ( the maximal number of particles ) limit for @xmath3 using quantum mechanics or mapping to the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hje ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in @xcite",

    "the variables are located on 1-d axes and the time derivative of some variable depends on its neighbors ) are considered as a model of coupled diffusion processes : a situation in 2 dimensional space , when there is a diffusion in one dimension , and jump process in the other dimension ( continuous diffusion later is replaced by discrete jumps ) .",
    "@xcite considers a strip of three chains of equation , each of chains defined in 2-dimensional space , identifying the model with genetic switch phenomenon .",
