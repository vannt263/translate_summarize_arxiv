    "wave - particle duality is a very interesting and intriguing aspect of quantum theory .",
    "bohr argued that the wave and particle aspects of quantum objects , which we shall call _ quantons _ , are complementary in nature , in the sense that if an experiment exposes the wave nature , it will completely hide the particle aspect and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "einstein had proposed his famous recoiling slit experiment ( see e.g. @xcite ) in order to refute the complementarity principle .",
    "it was later realized that wave and particle aspects could be revealed simultaneously , although to a quantitavely limited extent .",
    "wave - particle duality is now understood as a constraint on the quantitative measures of the wave and particle natures , namely duality relations for interference experiments @xcite .",
    "englert had proved a duality relation for a two - path interference , which is an inequality involving a _",
    "distinguishability _ @xmath0 and fringe visibility @xmath1 , @xmath2 distinguishability is a measure which assumes the presence of a device which is capable of determining which of the two slits , or two paths , the quanton went through .",
    "if the device determines which path the quanton has traveled through without any error ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) , then no interference fringes will appear at the detector ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is an ambiguity in the which - path information ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) , the quanton will show a reduced fringe visibility ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the duality relation ( [ 2duality ] ) was also experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "wave - particle duality in two - slit experiments has also been connected to things like entropic uncertainty relations @xcite , and the dichotomy between symmetry and asymmetry @xcite .",
    "wave - particle duality is expected to hold even when a quanton goes through more than two slits or paths .",
    "several attempts were made to formulate a similar duality relation for the case of multi - path experiments @xcite , without a completely satisfactory duality relation .",
    "the issue of wave - particle duality in multi - path experiments has also been probed in the framework of entropic uncertainty @xcite . for the particular case of three - slit interference ,",
    "a new duality relation was recently derived @xcite , where the wave nature was characterized by the conventional fringe visibility or contrast , but the particle nature was characterize by a new distinguishability @xmath7 which is based on unambigious quantum state discrimination ( uqsd ) @xcite .",
    "the duality relation , for three - slit interference , has the form @xcite @xmath8 if one uses this definition of distinguishability , one gets a different form of two - slit duality relation @xcite @xmath9 although different in form , the above relation is completely equivalent to ( [ 2duality ] ) .",
    "the form of the above two duality relations is different .",
    "this means that a universal duality relation for multi - slit interference , _ involving fringe visibility _",
    ", is probably not possible .",
    "a new measure of wave nature could probably make a universal duality relation possible .",
    "coherence in optics has long been thought to be representative of wave properties , and it has also been connected to distinguishability of paths @xcite",
    ". however , a good quantitative measure of quantum coherence was missing .",
    "recently a measure of coherence was introduced , which is just the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix of a system namely @xmath10 , with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this measure is basis dependent , as it should be , and has the minimum value zero , for a diagonal density matrix .",
    "however , there is no well - defined upper limit to this measure , as it depends on the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the system . using this measure ,",
    "a normalized quantity called coherence was very recently introduced @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "this quantity can assume value between 0 and 1 , and can be a measure of wave - nature just like fringe visibility . here",
    "@xmath14 are the matrix elements of the density operator of the system , in the basis formed by the set of @xmath13 orthogonal states , which correspond to the quanton passing through the @xmath13 different slits . based on this new measure of wave nature , the following duality relation for n - slit interference was obtained @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath7 is a path distinguishability based on uqsd .",
    "the above is a universal duality relation for n - slit interference .",
    "it can be shown to reduce to ( [ 2duality ] ) and ( [ 3duality ] ) for two- and three - slit interference , respectively .    however , a shortcoming of the above relation is that it is not clear if @xmath16 can be measured in an experiment .",
    "while the fringe visibility can be experimentally measured to quantify the wave nature in ( [ 2duality ] ) and ( [ 3duality ] ) , @xmath16 appears to be just a theoretical construct .",
    "the ability to measure quantum coherence is a much sought after objective , and has been under research attention @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that @xmath16 can actually be measured in a multi - slit interference experiment .",
    "let us first look at the case of a @xmath13-slit quantum interference with quantons , without any which - path detection . in @xmath13-slit interference ,",
    "if @xmath17 is the amplitude of the quanton to go through the @xmath18th slit , then state of the quanton , after passing through the slit , can be described as sum of all possible amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath17 , to go through different slits . since the slits are well separated , the states @xmath17 should be orthogonal to each other .",
    "we may choose @xmath17 to be normalized , and associate a weight factor with it , which determines the probability of the quanton to go through a particular slit .",
    "@xmath19 the probability of the particle to go through ( say ) kth slit is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . since the states @xmath22",
    "are orthonormal , they can be assumed to form basis states to describe the quanton after it has passed through the slits .",
    "the interference on the screen is described by the probability density of particle hitting the screen at particular position @xmath23 .",
    "the expression for the pattern on the screen will have the following general form @xmath24 the first term just represents the sum of patterns formed by the quanton coming out of individual slits , without any interference .",
    "the second term represents the interference between the amplitudes of quanton coming out of jth and kth slits , summed over all j s and k s .",
    "one would notice here that the multi - slit interference pattern consists of all possible two - slit terms ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "there are no 3-slit or multiple - slit terms , which is a direct consquence of the born rule .",
    "this aspect of interference has been used to test born rule in 3-slit interference experiments @xcite .",
    "now , if one wants to find out which slit the particle went through , one has to have some kind of path - detecting device in place . without going into the details of",
    "what kind of device one may use , we just consider certain fundamental aspects of what such a detection should involve . according to von nuemann , in a quantum measurement , the first process should be to let the detector interact with the quanton and get entangled with it @xcite .",
    "this involves building up of correlations between the quanton and the path - detector .",
    "the necessary condition for a quantum measurement of which slit the quanton went through , is satisfied when each @xmath26 gets correlated with certain state of the path - detector @xmath27 .",
    "the combined quanton - detector state , in such a situation , assumes the following entangled form @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the state of the path - detector if the quanton went through the @xmath18th path . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the detector states @xmath29 to be normalized , but not necessarily orthogonal . with",
    "the path - detector added to the interference setup , the pattern of the quantons hitting the screen has the following form @xmath30 while the first term remains unaffected by the introduction of path - detector , the second term , which gives rise to interference , is reduced by the factors @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , for completely orthogonal path - detector states , @xmath32 , and the interference pattern disappears .",
    "so , it is clear from this very general analysis that any attempt to gain information , about which slit the quanton went through , affects the interference . in other words ,",
    "probing the particle nature of the quanton more precisely , degrades its wave nature which is characterized by interference .    in order to quantify the wave nature of the quanton",
    ", one needs to quantify the sharpness of the interference pattern .",
    "the interference visibility is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the maximum and minimum intensity , respectively , in some region of the interference pattern .",
    "while this visibility works well for two - slit interference experiments , it is not clear whether the same definition suffices for multi - slit experiments @xcite",
    ".      coherence as defined by ( [ coherence ] ) has been shown to capture the wave aspect of a quanton well .",
    "let us calculate the coherence @xmath16 for the state ( [ ent ] ) . since coherence is a property of the quanton alone , we will first trace out the path - detector states , to obtain a reduced density matrix of the quanton . writing the corresponding density operator for the state ( [ ent ] ) , and taking a trace over an orthonormal set of path - detector states ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the reduced density operator of the quanton @xmath35 inserting this reduced density in the expression for coherence ( [ coherence ] ) , and using @xmath22 as the basis , one arrives at @xmath36 two extreme cases may be worth noting here .",
    "if the detector states @xmath29 are all mutually orthogonal to each other , the coherence @xmath16 is 0 .",
    "this implies that in this situation , the fringe visibility goes to zero .",
    "this is also the case when the interference disappears . on the other extreme , if all the path - detector states @xmath27 are identical , and all the @xmath37 s are equal to @xmath38 , the coherence @xmath16 is equal to 1 .",
    "this is the special case where there is zero path information about the quanton , and the quanton is equally likely to pass through any of the @xmath13 slits . in this situation one",
    "gets sharpest interference . for other nonzero values of @xmath39 , and different amplitudes of the quanton passing through different slits",
    ", @xmath16 will lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "drr suggested that any newly defined visibility should satisfy the following criteria @xcite + ( 1 ) it should be possible to give a definition of visibility that is based only on the interference pattern , without explicitly referring to the matrix elements of @xmath40 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) it should vary continuously as a function of the matrix elements of @xmath40 . +",
    "( 3 ) if the system shows no interference , visibility should reach its global minimum .",
    "+ ( 4 ) if @xmath40 represents a pure state ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) and all n beams are equally populated ( i.e. , all @xmath42 ) , visibility should reach its global maximum . + ( 5 ) visibility considered as a function in the parameter space ( @xmath43 ) should have only global extrema , no local ones .",
    "+ ( 6 ) visibility should be independent of our choice of the coordinate system .",
    "+ coherence , as defined by ( [ cn ] ) , satisfies drr s criteria ( 2 ) through ( 6 ) .",
    "however , criterion ( 1 ) implies that it should be possible to talk of coherence based only on the interference pattern .",
    "this point will be addressed in the next section .",
    "next we address the issue of measuring coherence . in order to see how one may try to measure coherence , one has to have an intereference pattern . for getting an interference pattern",
    "we theoretically analyze the behavior of a quanton passing through @xmath13 equally spaced slits .",
    "we assume that the quanton is traveling along the z - axis , and encounters n - slits which lie in the x - y plane , as shown in figure [ nslit ] .",
    "the slits are centered at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the distance between any two neighboring slits is @xmath46 .",
    "we also assume that the state that emerges from the jth slit , is a gaussian along x - axis , centered at @xmath47 .",
    "the width of the gaussian is very small , and is supposed to be of the order of the width of the slit .",
    "thus the state that emerges from the slits , at time @xmath48 , has the following form , in the position basis @xmath49 where @xmath50 . after traveling a distance @xmath51 , in a time @xmath52",
    ", the quanton reaches the screen .",
    "the time evolution of the gaussian can be calculated by either assuming the quanton to be particle of mass @xmath53 , moving with a momentum corresponding to a de broglie wavelength @xmath54 , or by assuming it to be a photon of wavelength @xmath54 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the state of the quanton , at the screen , is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the probability density of the quanton , hitting the screen at a position @xmath57 , can now calculated as @xmath58 notice that @xmath59 , being the width of one slit , is very small , and hence @xmath60 is negligible in comparison to @xmath61 . also , it is convenient to combine the phases of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 , where @xmath63 is now real . with these assumptions ,",
    "the above assumes the following form , @xmath65 where @xmath66 . the expression ( [ intf ] ) represents a n - slit interference pattern in the presence of path - detectors .",
    "the distance between the primary maxima , or the fringe width is given by @xmath67 , which is much larger than the distance between the two slits , @xmath46 , and also the width of a slit @xmath59 . if the position on the screen @xmath57 is on any maximum away from the one at @xmath68",
    ", @xmath69 is negligible in its comparison . with these things in mind , the probability density of quantons on the screen",
    "can be simplified to @xmath70 for simplcity , we assume all the phases to be the same , i.e. , @xmath71 . notice that for @xmath72 , the cosine term is 1 , irrespective of the values of @xmath73 .",
    "these are the positions of the primary maxima , where the cosine contributions from every pair of slits are 1 .",
    "there are other positions where cosine terms from some slit pairs are 1 , but those from some others are not .",
    "those are the secondary maxima . the maximum intensity at a primary maximum is then given by , @xmath74 , and has the form @xmath75",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{imax}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the same experiment is performed using incoherent light , instead of coherent light , one has to average over the phases @xmath76 in ( [ intfs ] ) , and that would kill the cosine terms .",
    "the intensity , at the same position on the screen as in ( [ imax ] ) , is then given by @xmath77 one may carry out a careful photon counting experiment with coherent laser light to measure @xmath78 .",
    "a phase randomizer may then be added to the setup and the experiment repeated to measure @xmath79 .",
    "this procedure would allow one to calculate the following quantity @xmath80 where @xmath13 is the number of slits used in the experiment . comparing the r.h.s .",
    "of the above equation with ( [ cn ] ) , one finds that it is exactly the same as the coherence @xmath16 for the quanton !",
    "so , one can measure the value of coherence in a multislit experiment .",
    "needless to say , since the experiment involves two parts , it is important to make sure that number of photons coming out of the slits remains unchanged .",
    "thus the experimentally measured coherence can be written as @xmath81 in real situations , the interference fringes occur within a gaussian envelope , and the maxima on either side of the gaussian peak will be gradually lower in intensity .",
    "however , it does not matter which primary maximum is chosen for measuring the intensity .",
    "the procedure makes sure that the gaussian part cancels out and one gets an expression for coherence ( [ cmeas ] ) independent of the position of the primary maximum . with the measured coherence given by ( [ cexpt ] ) ,",
    "@xmath16 also satisfies drr s criterion ( 1 ) for being a good measure of interference visibility .      in real life situations",
    ", it may happen that the quanton is affected by the environment , and can no longer be described by a pure state . in such situations , the state of the quanton and path - detector combined ,",
    "may be represented by a mixed state density operator @xmath82 one can then follow a procedure closely similar to that in the preceding subsection , and obtain the reduced density matrix for the quanton at the screen . the diagonal part of the density matrix in the position representation ,",
    "is then given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum intensity at a primary maximum is then given by @xmath85 .",
    "again , for incoherent light , random variations in @xmath86 will kill the cosine terms .",
    "experimentally measured coherence is then given by @xmath87 which agrees with the theoretical expression for coherence ( [ cnm ] ) .      in the preceding subsections",
    ", we looked at the problem of measuring the coherence of a quanton as it emerges from n slits , and a path detector tries to get information about which of the n slits the quanton passed through .",
    "the coherence of the quanton degrades in the process of path detection .",
    "this procedure is well suited for testing wave - particle duality relations . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested in measuring the coherence of the incoming quanton as it enters the slits , the above procedure may not be well suited for the job .",
    "one reason is that in the preceding procedure , one needs to change the incoming state by randomizing the phases at different slits .",
    "one may want a measuring procedure where the incoming state is not disturbed .",
    "another reason could be that the phase randomizer may not be easily realizable .",
    "we propose another procedure for this particular case .",
    "we assume that we have a n - slit system and a path detector in place where the path - distinguishability is tunable . at the least",
    ", it should be switchable between two modes corresponding to ( a ) making all the paths completely _",
    "indistinguishable _ and ( b ) making all the paths fully _",
    "distinguishable_. we denote the the two cases ( a ) and ( b ) by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "first the intensity at a primary maximum is measured when all the n paths are indistinguishable , i.e. , @xmath27s are all identical and parallel . for a pure quanton state , this intensity can be obtained simply by putting @xmath90 for all @xmath73 in ( [ imax ] ) , and is given by @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{iparall}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next the path - detector is switched to the mode where all the n paths are fully distinguishable , and the intensity is measured at the same position on the screen as before .",
    "this intentsity can be obtained simply by putting @xmath92 for all @xmath25 in ( [ imax ] ) , and is given by @xmath93 coherence of the incoming quanton can then be measured as @xmath94 the right hand side of the above is the coherence of the incoming quanton , in the basis of the n - slit paths , _ unmodified by the path - detector_. doing away with the factor @xmath95 in the above , gives the unnormalized coherence introduced by baumgratz et.al .",
    "@xcite . exactly the same procedure will also work for quantons described by a mixed state .",
    "so , in order to measure the coherence of a beam of light or massive particles , one needs to introduce a n - slit setup in its path , and measure the intensity at a primary maximum , in two different modes of the path - detector .      for completeness",
    ", we briefly discuss the path distinguishability @xmath7 introduced in @xcite . from ( [ ent ] )",
    "it is clear that in order to tell which slit the quanton went through , one has to be able to tell which path - detector state , out of the set @xmath96 materialized . if one is only interested in the path - dector and is not concerned with what happens to the quanton after passing through the slits , one can write the density operator corresponding to the state ( [ ent ] ) , and trace out the states of the quanton .",
    "the resulting reduced density operator for the path detector is @xmath97 so , essentially a particular detector state @xmath98 occurs with a probability @xmath20 .",
    "the only problem is that the states @xmath96 are not orthogonal to each other , in general .",
    "the problem of path - detection then boils down to the following .",
    "certain known non - orthogonal states @xmath98 occur at random , one at a time , and which one occurs is not known .",
    "one has to tell _ unambiguously _ which of the set @xmath96 is a given state .",
    "our view is that the answer has to be unambiguous , only then can one claim that the particle has gone through a particular slit .",
    "an answer which is ambiguous , does nt serve the purpose .    in general , the best strategy to distinguish between non - orthogonal states",
    "is unambiguous quantum state discrimination ( uqsd ) @xcite . in uqsd ,",
    "the maximum probability with which non - orthogonal pure states can be _ unambiguously _ distinguished , can be calculated @xcite .",
    "the probability of successfully distinguishing between @xmath13 non - othogonal states @xmath96 , via uqsd is bounded by @xcite @xmath99 it should be reiterated that the probabilities @xmath100 are decided by the initial superposition in the quanton state .",
    "the path - distinguishability @xmath101 can then be _ defined _ as the maximum probability with which the @xmath13 paths of the particle can be distinguished without any error , and is given here by the upper bound of ( [ pn ] ) @xcite @xmath102 the path - distinguishability can take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "for all mutually orthogonal @xmath96 , one gets @xmath103 .",
    "it should be mentioned that that uqsd works for linearly independent states . in the situation where the set @xmath96 is not linearly independent",
    ", uqsd will not work , and one has to employ some other strategy to unambiguously tell , probably in a limited way , which of @xmath96 states one has obtained .",
    "however , one can still continue to use the upper bound given by ( [ pn ] ) .",
    "of course in this scenario , the bound may not be reachable .    the quantum coherence @xmath16 , given by ( [ cn ] ) or ( [ cnm ] ) , and the path distinguishability , given by ( [ d ] ) , are bounded by the inequality ( [ nduality ] ) @xcite .",
    "in the light of the demonstration of experimental measurability of @xmath16 , the inequality ( [ nduality ] ) can be treated as a general duality relation which works for interference experiments with any number of slits .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a method of experimentally measuring the recently introduced measure of coherence , @xmath16 in a multi - slit interference experiment .",
    "coherence @xmath16 had earlier been argued to be a good candidate for quantifying the wave - nature of quantons in interference experiments , and a duality relation between @xmath104 and the path - distinguishability @xmath7 , based on uqsd , had been proved @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 has been shown to be related to measured intensities in interference experiments , which puts it firmly as a good measure of wave nature of quantons in multi - slit interference experiments .",
    "additionally , it makes @xmath105 a universal wave - particle duality relation , valid for interference experiments with any number of slits .",
    "apart from the issue of wave - particle duality , a method of measuring the coherence of any given beam of quantons has also been proposed .",
    "tania paul is thankful to the centre for theoretical physics , jamia millia islamia for providing the facilities of the centre during the course of this work .",
