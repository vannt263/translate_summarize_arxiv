    "condensed matter systems are an endless resource of emergent physical phenomena and associated quasiparticles . majorana fermions , which are particles that are their own antiparticles and which have been first proposed as particles in the context of high energy physics , emerge beautifully as zero energy excitations in condensed matter setups @xcite .",
    "specifically , they are predicted to occur as zero energy excitations in solid - state systems , such as genuine @xmath0-wave superconductors @xcite , or engineered from topological insulators @xcite , semiconductor wires in a magnetic field @xcite , or in chains of magnetic atoms @xcite , all in the proximity of @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "these exotic objects are robust against local perturbations and , moreover , they obey non - abelian statistics @xcite under braiding operations , thus recommending them as qubits for the implementation of topological quantum computation .",
    "electronic transport is the foremost experimental tool for investigating the majorana fermions physics but alternative , _ non - invasive _ , methods that preserve the quantum states would be highly desired to address these objects .",
    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) has been established as an extremely versatile tool to address equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium electronic and spin systems non - invasively @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions , too , have been recently under theoretical scrutiny in the context of cavity qed physics @xcite . however , most of these studies dealt with effective low energy models that involved majorana fermions only , leaving the bulk physics , which is at the heart of the majorana physics , largely unexplored .",
    "and @xmath2 , respectively , and measuring the field at the end with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the difference between the two gives a direct access to the electronic correlation function in the wire ( see text ) .",
    "the presence of majorana end modes in the finite wire ( black curves ) is also signaled in the cavity response . ]",
    "the basic idea behind cavity qed with electronic system is that it allows one to extract various properties of the latter , such as its spectrum and its electronic distribution function , from photonic transport measurements , as opposed to electronic transport .",
    "such photonic transport is quantified by the complex transmission coefficient @xmath5 that relates the output and input photonic fields as depicted in fig .",

    ", one finds @xcite , appendix  [ inputoutput ] : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the frequency and the escape rate of the cavity , respectively , while @xmath9 is an electronic correlation function that depends on the actual coupling between the two systems , and which contains information about the spectrum of the electronic system .",
    "the phase and amplitude response of the cavity close to resonance @xmath10 are related to the susceptibility @xmath9 as follows : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 $ ] ( @xmath16 $ ] ) is the real ( imaginary ) part of the susceptibility .    in this paper , we evaluate the function @xmath9 first for the simple case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0-wave superconductor described by the kitaev chain and then for more realistic model of a 1d topological semiconducting wire in proximity of a superconductor .",

    "we provide a brief summary of our results .",
    "technical details of the calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "in the following we will consider various models of @xmath0-wave superconductors coupled to a microwave ( superconducting ) cavity , such as the kitaev @xmath0-wave superconductor model , and the spin - orbit coupled nanowire subjected to a magnetic field and in the proximity of an @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "the general hamiltonian for the one - dimensional systems we consider here is of the form : @xmath17 being the sum of the electronic hamiltonian , its capacitive coupling to the cavity , and the free photon field , respectively .",
