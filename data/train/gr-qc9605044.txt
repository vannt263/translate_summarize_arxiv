    "over the last few years 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton theories have been studied extensively in their string inspired ( cghs ) version @xcite as well as in more general forms @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations to study such models arises from the hope that within the simplified setting of 2d models one can gain insight into physical properties of 4d gravity .",
    "they actually allow for example black hole solutions and hawking radiation and are more amenable to quantum treatments than their 4d counterparts .",
    "the two most frequently considered theories , the string inspired cghs as well as spherically reduced gravity ( srg ) differ drastically in some of their physical properties .",
    "for example differences were observed with respect to the completeness of null geodesics for those two models @xcite .",
    "these differences directly lead one to investigate physical properties of a generalized model of which the two prominent examples are simply particular cases .",
    "important classical quantities are the energy at spatial and null infinity , the so called arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) and the bondi - sachs ( bs ) mass , respectively ( provided the global structure of the space - time is the same as for srg ) . for general models , however ,",
    "there exist in general no flat space time solutions @xcite and therefore a proper reference space - time has to be chosen .",
    "a second important point is to realize that these `` masses '' depend on the asymptotic behavior of the metric and are therefore only defined with respect to a particular observer .",
    "our approach is based on the second order formalism .",
    "significant insight can also be gained from a first order formalism @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an important feature in semiclassical considerations is the behavior of hawking radiation . in the cghs model",
    "it is just proportional to the cosmological constant whereas the dependence in srg is inverse to its mass , which implies an accelerated evaporation towards the end of its lifetime . as we will show",
    "a generalized theory will exhibit hawking radiation which is proportional to the black hole mass in terms of positive or negative powers of the black hole mass , depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "in section 2 we repeat some relevant results of @xcite for the metric and the global structure of the classical solution of a generalized dilaton lagrangian which , for a certain range of parameters posesses a singularity structure coinciding with the one of the schwarzschild black hole . the adm and bs mass",
    "are calculated in section 3 .",
    "furthermore we will present a definition for energy , differing from the one proposed by hawking @xcite , by taking a modified reference space - time .",
    "the path integral measure and the problem of interpretation of various energy definitions will be discussed in section 4 before we finally demonstrate the dynamical formation of black holes in the frame work of conformal gauge , with special emphasis on the necessary boundary conditions .",
    "among the numerous different generalizations of the cghs model @xcite we consider the action @xmath0 this form of the lagrangian covers e.g. the cghs model @xcite for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , spherically reduced gravity @xcite @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite @xmath5 , @xmath6 . lemos and sa",
    "@xcite give the global solutions for @xmath7 and all values of @xmath8 , mignemi @xcite considers @xmath1 and all values of @xmath9 .",
    "the models of @xcite correspond to @xmath10 .",
    "the classical solutions of ( [ ldil ] ) were already found in @xcite but since the solutions for the metric will be used extensively in the following sections they shall be repeated here . letting @xmath11",
    "represent one of the coordinates the line element reads    @xmath12    with @xmath13 the transformation @xmath14 brings the metric into eddington - finkelstein form ( ef ) @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 where the constants are given by @xmath17 the scalar curvature of the metric ( [ metric ] ) has the form @xmath18 or equivalently for ( [ newl ] ) @xmath19 finally , a third form of the metric , the generalized schwarzschild metric , @xmath20 is obtained by means of the transformation @xmath21 since below we will repeatedly make use of the special cases of asymptotically minkowski , rindler and de sitter space - times we list them for completeness . after a suitable rescaling ( see eq.([k])below ) they are @xmath22 with @xmath23 . as can be seen from ( [ curv ] ) and ( [ dss ] ) for @xmath24 these metrics go to the unit metric or to de sitter metric at the asymptotic flat or constant curvature regions . for @xmath25 we can not construct static metrics with proper asymptotic behavior . throughout this paper",
    "asymptotically minkowski , rindler or de sitter solution will imply @xmath24 .",
    "the global structure is completely determined by @xmath26 or equivalently by @xmath27 , which is nothing else but the norm of the killing vector whose zeros correspond to the horizons .",
    "the corresponding penrose diagrams for all possible values of the parameters of the action ( [ ldil ] ) were presented in @xcite , where it was shown that genuine schwarzschild like behavior is restricted to the region @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "the aim of this section is to calculate the adm mass for our model .",
    "more precisely , we will obtain the value of a generalized definition for the energy at spatial infinity , for space - times whose lapse does not approach @xmath30 asymptotically . the standard approach to obtain this quantity",
    "is to split off the dynamical part @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the metric @xmath33 and the dilaton field @xmath34 , respectively and then calculate the energy defined as the value of the standard hamiltonian taken on the shell of zero constraints @xcite @xcite .",
    "instead of going through these lengthy arguments we shall first review some recent very elegant methods that arise from the canonical formalism of gravity @xcite @xcite and will later on apply them to solutions of our model .",
    "we review what kind of slicing we have to work with and will then outline the main steps on how to obtain the expression for the total energy .",
    "consider a one - dimensional spacelike slice @xmath35 drawn in our spacetime ( see fig.[adm1 ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath35 has a boundary point @xmath36 .",
    "let the unit , outward - pointing , spacelike normal of the point @xmath37 as embedded in @xmath35 be @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath35 is a surface of constant @xmath39 with metric @xmath40 then the space - time metric near @xmath35 can be written in adm form @xcite @xmath41    to obtain the expression for the total energy one has to cast the action into hamiltonian form .",
    "boundary terms have to be added to the action to ensure that its associated variational principle fixes the induced metric and the dilaton on the boundary .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the form of a suitable hamiltonian with boundary terms at @xmath37 is the following : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the adm momentum conjugate to @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the hamiltonian and the momentum constraint respectively .",
    "since the expression for the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) diverges in general , a reference hamiltonian @xmath47 has to be subtracted to obtain the physical hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath48 , which defines the quasilocal energy is given by @xmath49 - n[\\phi]^0)\\ ] ] where the second term indicates that the value is referenced to a background .",
    "we shall only consider the case when @xmath50 at @xmath37 , i.e the on - shell value of hamiltonian will be associated only with time translations ( @xmath51 does not generate displacements normal to the boundary ) .",
    "defining the total energy as the value of the physical hamiltonian on the boundary we finally get @xmath52 - n[\\phi]^0)|_{b}\\ ] ] only for @xmath53 this coincides with the adm mass , whereas the additional factor @xmath54 in ( [ energy ] ) gives the proper definition for the total energy for space - times whose lapse does nt go to one asymptotically @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall see at the end of this section , the form of ( [ energy ] ) is not unique .    to apply this result to our action ( [ ldil ] )",
    "we take the line element @xmath55 with the same @xmath56 and @xmath27 as in ( [ oldg ] ) and ( [ gl:34 ] ) , respectively .",
    "this form of the metric is obtained from ( [ metric ] ) by a transformation analogous to ( [ ef2gs ] ) . for @xmath57 ( @xmath1 )",
    "this is just the metric in generalized schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "we see that @xmath11 now corresponds to the radial coordinate of the adm - metric ( [ admform ] ) , @xmath58 .",
    "since the radial shift is zero the unit normal @xmath59 to the boundary @xmath37 is therefore simply @xmath60 using @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the function in the metric ( [ metric ] ) of a reference space - time . where possible we will use flat space - time as our reference .",
    "it should be noted that this expression is independent of the function @xmath56 and therefore we have no @xmath8-dependence on @xmath48 for the action ( [ ldil ] ) . calculating this quantity at spacelike infinity corresponds to the adm mass . inserting ( [ gl:34 ] ) into ( [ fenergy ] ) with @xmath64 for @xmath63",
    "the diverging terms cancel each other whereas the next order terms give a finite contribution .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 this coincides with the expectation that the parameter @xmath66 is proportional to the mass .",
    "notice that for these expressions the reference space - time @xmath67 itself contains already a curvature singularity @xcite except for the special cases considered below . for spherically reduced gravity @xmath68 the flat space - time region",
    "is located at @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , by using ( [ gl:34c ] ) it is straightforwardly verified that the next order term of ( [ e1 ] ) becomes @xmath70 which coincides with the usual adm expression for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however , the results ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) still retain some arbitrariness . to show this consider the transformation of ( [ ds2 ] )",
    "@xmath71 this preserves the form of the metric @xmath72 and at the same time we are able to obtain dimensions of length for @xmath73 and @xmath74 . simultaneously @xmath75 is changed .",
    "we see that an unambiguous definition of @xmath75 includes two important ingredients .",
    "the first one is the reference point for energy which is specified by the choice of ground state solution .",
    "we define the ground state configurations by @xmath64 . for the important particular cases of asymptotically minkowski , rindler and de sitter models this choice gives zero or constant curvature ground state solutions .",
    "the second ingredient is the asymptotic condition for the metric .",
    "it corresponds to the choice of an observer who measures energy and hawking radiation at the asymptotic region .",
    "this ambiguity in the choice of time for the asymptotic observer is expressed in ( [ pres ] ) . in the spirit of these remarks ,",
    "the value ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) of the adm mass should be specified as `` the adm mass with respect to @xmath64 solution measured by an asymptotic observer with time and length scales defined by metric ( [ metric ] ) '' .",
    "this value is unambiguously defined for all values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the important particular cases mentioned above other definitions",
    "are more relevant : @xmath76 * asymptotically minkowski and rindler spaces : * as mentioned above , eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) can be used to obtain dimensions of length for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this happens to be the case if @xmath77 has dimensions of energy squared .",
    "therefore a combination of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , e.g. @xmath80 , or equivalently of @xmath66 and @xmath37 , is a natural choice since all of these quantities have dimension of energy squared .",
    "however , because our vacuum is defined as @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath81 , only @xmath79 should contribute to @xmath77 .",
    "if we require in addition that for the minkowskian case our metric approaches asymptotically the unit one @xmath82=diag(-1,1 ) , we have to use @xmath83 which in turn gives @xmath84 with @xmath85 we obtain from ( [ energy ] ) @xmath86 for the special case of asymptotically minkowski and rindler space - times this gives @xmath87 respectively . @xmath76 * asymptotically de sitter spaces : * a rescaling of ( [ ds2 ] ) as in ( [ k ] ) does not change the asymptotic behavior of ( [ genschw ] ) , which is given by @xmath88 but the coefficient of the asymptotically vanishing term is changed as can be seen from ( [ l ] )",
    ". therefore we get @xmath89 @xmath76 * modified definition of mass : * finally we want to present a modification to hawkings definitions for energy .",
    "eq.([energy ] ) was obtained by subtracting the value of the reference space - time @xmath90 from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "following the line of argument in ref.@xcite @xmath54 was pulled out of the subtraction term by setting @xmath91 .",
    "however , this condition is not easily implemented because @xmath54 diverges in general at the boundary . here",
    "we suggest the more natural choice of leaving the lapse in the reference term which then still fulfills the foregoing condition . as a consequence this modifies ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ fenergy ] ) to @xmath92 - n^0n[\\phi]^0\\right)\\right|_{b}= 4e^{-2\\phi}\\left.\\left(l(\\phi)-l^0(\\phi)\\right)\\right|_b\\ ] ] and by inserting @xmath27",
    "we obtain @xmath93 which now does not only hold for @xmath94 but on the whole space - time .",
    "this value depends again in the same manner as above on the asymptotic condition for the metric .",
    "note that for asymptotically minkowski , rindler or de sitter solutions the two expressions ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ eours ] ) for @xmath48 agree . on the other hand , for arbitrary asymptotic behavior the two values of @xmath48 correspond to two different definitions of the asymptotic observer in reference space - time . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite mann also considered a modified reference space - time for the energy to obtain the so called quasilocal mass , which also diverges from hawking s proposal .",
    "note that the same rescaling as in ( [ k ] ) could certainly be applied to ( [ newe ] ) thereby giving additional coefficients of @xmath37 and the parameters .",
    "a similar result was also obtained in @xcite by applying a regge - teitelboim argument .      in the first part of this chapter we obtained the value of the total energy which corresponds to the adm mass at spatial infinity . here",
    "we will show that @xmath48 on @xmath95 , the so called bs mass @xmath96 , equals @xmath75 and does not depend on the value of the retarded time coordinate @xmath97 .",
    "however , the procedure to obtain this quantity is logically different .",
    "the main difference with respect to the calculation of the adm mass above is that we do _ not _ take the limit @xmath98 along a _",
    "slice but instead we will consider the limit of expression ( [ energy ] ) along a particular null hypersurface n associated with _",
    "different _ slices along a line of constant retarded time @xcite ( see fig.[bondi1 ] ) . for convenience",
    "we will work again with the ef - metric ( [ ds2 ] ) .",
    "first we define a future directed lightlike vector @xmath99 and pick another lightlike vector @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .",
    "they are @xmath102 next , along the null hypersurface n we let @xmath103 define the timelike normal to the @xmath35 slices spanning the points of n. similarly we define its spacelike normal @xmath104    notice that the choice of @xmath99 will ensure that the energy that we compute is associated with a proper rest frame such that the timelike normal behaves like @xmath105 , which is obtained by using ( [ ef2gs ] ) .",
    "therefore , with @xmath106 we get @xmath107-\\tilde{n}[\\phi]|^{0}\\right)= \\left ( l(u)-\\sqrt{l(u)l^0(u ) } \\right ) \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial u}\\ ] ] and @xmath108-\\left(n\\tilde{n}[\\phi]\\right)|^{0}=\\left ( l(u)-l^0(u ) \\right ) \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial u}.\\ ] ] using ( [ bondin ] ) in ( [ energy ] ) and remembering that @xmath109 and @xmath110 we finally obtain @xmath111 which is exactly the same as expression ( [ fenergy ] ) and therefore the adm mass and the bondi - sachs mass turn out to have the same value .",
    "this can be readily understood by recalling that the difference between the bs and the adm mass is the integral of a stress energy flux which vanishes at this purely classical level .",
    "similarly ( [ modifiedn ] ) exactly reproduces the result of ( [ newe ] ) thereby showing that also the modified definition of mass on @xmath112 agrees with the value at spatial infinity .",
    "there are a number of ways of calculating the hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "one of them consists in comparing vacua before and after the formation of a black hole . in the case of generalized dilaton gravity",
    "this way is technically rather involved .",
    "we prefer a simpler approach based on an analysis of static black hole solutions .",
    "consider a generalized schwarzschild black hole given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 has a fixed behavior at the asymptotic region @xmath115 : @xmath116 with @xmath117 corresponding to the ground state solution . at the horizon",
    "we have @xmath118 .",
    "we can calculate the geometric hawking temperature as the normal derivative of the norm of the killing vector @xmath119 at the ( nondegenerate ) horizon @xcite @xmath120    let us introduce the coordinate @xmath121 which is an analog of the regge - wheeler _ tortoise coordinate _",
    "@xmath122 for the ordinary schwarzschild black hole @xmath123 then the metric takes the conformaly trivial form with @xmath124 in conformal coordinates the stress energy tensor looks like @xcite @xmath125+t_- . \\label{jtmm}\\ ] ] one can choose coordinates such that in the asymptotic region @xmath126=0 .",
    "\\label{tj0}\\ ] ] this choice ensures that there is no radiation in the ground state .",
    "it means that we measure hawking radiation of a black hole without any contribution from background unruh radiation .",
    "the constant @xmath127 is defined by the condition at the horizon @xmath128 in the spirit of .",
    "the corresponding vacuum state is called the unruh vacuum . in this state",
    "there is no energy flux at the black hole horizon .",
    "of course , there can not be such a thing as an observer at the horizon .",
    "however , as we shall demonstrate bellow , predictions of the theory with regard to measurements made at infinity are independent of the choice of coordinates at the horizon . in the case of four dimensional black holes",
    "this was shown in @xcite .",
    "taking into account equations ( [ jtmm ] ) , ( [ tj0 ] ) and ( [ thor ] ) one obtains a relation between @xmath129 $ ] at the horizon and the asymptotic value of @xmath130 : @xmath131|_{\\rm hor } \\label{ashor}\\ ] ] the following simple identities are useful : @xmath132 where prime denotes differentiation of @xmath133 with respect to @xmath73 . by substituting ( [ useful ] ) into ( [ ashor ] )",
    "we obtain the hawking flux @xmath134    it is easy to demonstrate that our result is independent of a particular choice of conformal coordinates provided the behavior at the asymptotic region is fixed . without destroying",
    "the conformal gauge one can change coordinates so that @xmath135 with two arbitrary functions @xmath136 .",
    "since the behavior of @xmath32 at @xmath115 is fixed , @xmath137 . the transformation with arbitrary @xmath138 does not change @xmath130 .    before we start to apply ( [ jflux ] ) to some specific space - times we remark that as in the case of the adm and bondi mass the value will once again depend on our choice of the asymptotic behavior of the metric .",
    "we will use the same form of the metric as for the calculation of the adm mass , equations ( [ pres ] ) and ( [ l ] ) , which give the metric ( [ gsch ] ) after a transformation like ( [ ef2gs ] ) . for the most interesting space - times of our action ( [ ldil ] ) we will explicitly present the solutions . @xmath76 * asymptotic minkowski spacetimes : * as mentioned above this corresponds to @xmath139 . from ( [ l ] )",
    "we get for @xmath140 @xmath141 the horizon determined by @xmath118 is located at @xmath142 and therefore we get @xmath143 for the special case @xmath1 , the cghs model , we have @xmath144 which results in @xmath145 thereby confirming the well known result for the cghs model , where we used the identification @xmath146 such that ( [ ldil ] ) reproduces the cghs action . for the case of @xmath76",
    "* asymptotic de - sitter spacetimes * we have from ( [ desit ] ) @xmath147 and get for the value of hawking radiation @xmath148 setting @xmath2 we have @xmath76 * asymptotic rindler spacetime . *",
    "according to ( [ l ] ) we have @xmath149 and the hawking radiation reads @xmath150 notice , that if we had not used the rescaling coefficient as in ( [ l ] ) , but if instead we had set @xmath151 we would have obtained @xmath145 which is just the result given in @xcite .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that there is a unique ultralocal path integral measure for a scalar field @xmath152 yielding a covariantly conserved stress energy tensor .",
    "this measure is defined by the equation @xmath153 it is also known @xcite that in four dimensional einstein gravity one can define energy in a unique and self - consistent way if and only if in the asymptotic region the metric is approaching fast enough that of flat minkowski space . as a consequence , hawking radiation and adm mass depend on a choice of asymptotic conditions and path integral measure .    in dilaton gravity",
    "we have a new entity which is absent in einstein gravity , the dilaton field .",
    "one is tempted to use a rescaled metric at some steps of the calculations . in the present paper",
    "such a rescaling is trivial everywhere .",
    "this means that we are using just the metric @xmath154 which appears in the action ( [ ldil ] ) to define the path integral measure , stress energy tensor etc .",
    "of course , this is just a matter of interpretation .",
    "one can claim that the rescaled metric @xmath155 describes the geometry of space - time and thus should be used in the definitions of the above mentioned quantities .",
    "however , the rescaled metric should be used everywhere .",
    "otherwise , the quantum theory becomes inconsistent .",
    "for example , a part of diffeomorphism invariance can be lost .",
    "we believe that if one wishes to keep contact to four dimensional einstein gravity , which is diffeomorphism invariant , one should retain general coordinate invariance . in the context of dilaton gravity models",
    "a transition from @xmath154 to @xmath156 means replacement of one particular dilaton interaction by another .",
    "such a replacement should in general change the hawking radiation because the definitions of the stress energy tensor and path integral measure and the asymptotic behavior of metric are not conformally invariant .",
    "at least , conformal invariance of the hawking radiation was never proved .",
    "such conformal equivalence was conjectured in a recent paper by cadoni @xcite who used conformal transformation in general dilaton theory to remove kinetic term @xmath157 of the dilaton field .",
    "he also used a @xmath11-dependent path integral measure and @xmath11-dependent stress energy tensor to define the hawking radiation .",
    "a comparison shows that his results for the hawking temperature differ by an @xmath8 and @xmath9 dependent factor from ours , which were obtained directly without use of conformal transformation .",
    "we conclude that conformally equivalent theories do really give different results for the hawking radiation .",
    "this statement can be illustrated by an example from .@xcite , where the cghs black hole was transformed to the flat rindler space - time .",
    "due to the absence of black hole curvature singularity any radiation in the latter space should be considered as the unruh radiation rather than the hawking one .",
    "we have seen that both adm mass and hawking radiation depend on the asymptotic behavior of the metric and on the subtraction procedure of reference space - time contribution .",
    "this dependence is quite natural from a physical point of view .",
    "since energy and energy flux are not coordinate invariant , in addition to a zero energy state one should also define two observers .",
    "one of them corresponds to a particular solution , and the other to the reference zero point configuration . for asymptotically minkowski , rindler or de sitter solution",
    "there is a choice which is clearly preferable . with this choice",
    "our results for adm mass and hawking radiation are independent of coordinate transformations which vanish rapidly enough at asymptotic region . in the case of four dimensional einstein gravity",
    "appropriate asymptotic conditions were formulated by faddeev @xcite . for the cghs model with polyakov ",

    "the full ground state solution is covered by positive ( or negative ) values of @xmath184 or @xmath39 .",
    "hence the green function differs from the standard expression valid for infinite range of all coordinates .",
    "in the present paper we calculated the adm and bs mass and hawking radiation of the black hole solutions in generalized dilaton gravities described by the action ( [ ldil ] ) .",
    "special attention was paid to asymptotic conditions for the metric field .",
    "it turned out that both mass and stress energy tensor depend on these conditions . from a physical point of view",
    "this means that they are influenced by the choice of an asymptotic observer . for generic @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "this choice is not unique .",
    "it rather depends on the interpretation of particular two dimensional model and its relation to four dimensional gravity . for the selected values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to asymptotically minkowski , rindler or de sitter solutions",
    "there exists a preferred coordinate frame at infinity .",
    "this fact allows some physical conclusions .",
    "we can see that , depending on the parameters of the dilatonic action , the hawking temperature can be related to the black hole mass with positive or negative power . in a fully quantized theory the parameters",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 should become running couplings being functions of a scale parameter which could be the black hole mass .",
    "thus it could happen that a black hole which starts its evolution near the point @xmath202 , corresponding to spherically symmetric gravity , migrates in the course of evaporation to another region of the @xmath203 plane where the heat capacity becomes positive . with our present level of understanding the last statement",
    "is nothing more than an unsupported speculation , which should , however , be able to describe black hole evolution in some realistic quantum theory .",
    "we are grateful to w. kummer for important suggestions .",
    "especially we thank s.r .",
    "lau for advice on the subtleties of quasilocal energy .",
