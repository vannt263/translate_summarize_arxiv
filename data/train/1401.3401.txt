    "mean curvature flow evolves the submanifolds of the riemannian manifolds in the direction of their mean curvature vectors .",
    "the short - time existence and uniqueness of the solution of the mean curvature flow equation was proved .",
    "the mean curvature vector of a submanifold in a riemannian manifold is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the levi - civita connection , @xmath3 is a orthonormal frame of the submanifold s tangent bundle and @xmath4 is the orthogonal projection to the normal bundle of it .",
    "the mean curvature flow is an important example of the changing .",
    "sometimes the flow stops because of some singular points .",
    "recently the finite time singularity is focused and mean curvature flow has been investigated since it appeared from the study of annealing metals in physics in 1956 .",
    "many researchers study it and have found a lot of results .",
    "the mean curvature flow is the steepest descent flow for the area functional and is described by a parabolic system of partial differential equations .",
    "the problem area of it is geometry but it implies questions of partial differential equations . when @xmath5 is a hypersurface in @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the solution of mean curvature flow , then , by the weak maximum principle of it ( see also @xcite ) , we can see that if the initial manifold @xmath5 is in an open ball @xmath8 where @xmath9 then @xmath10 for any @xmath11 furthermore , other properties of the mean curvature flow in @xmath12 have been extensively studied . for example , wang investigates the mean curvature flow of graphs in @xcite and the author constructs explicit self - similar solutions and translating solitons for the mean curvature flow in @xmath13 in his last article @xcite . since the definition of the mean curvature vector is intricate as well as abstract , it is difficult or impossible to find the non - trivial and explicit solution of a given initial submanifold .",
    "however , we think of how explicit submanifolds of some concrete manifolds move by the mean curvature flow .",
    "the author noticed that if we consider the mean curvature flow of the hypersurfaces @xmath14 in the lagrangian submanifold of the form of ( * ? ? ? * ansatz 3.1 ) , they may change inside themselves .",
    "the prediction is correct with some restriction , to be showed in this paper . in this short article",
    "we deal with the mean curvature flow in the lagrangian submanifold and give the explicit solutions . by the next section of this paper",
    "we get the following theorem [ m ] and we treat a self - similar solution for the mean curvature flow in there .",
    "note that we can learn self - similar solutions for the mean curvature flow elementarily from @xcite and @xcite , and the self - expander , which means a self - similar solution of expanding , in the articles is an explicit product manifold @xmath15 in @xmath16 thus in the next steps , it is natural to study the mean curvature flow of the sphere @xmath17 inside it and theorem [ m ] .",

    "* theorem c ) and the domain of definition of @xmath31 can be extended to @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a minimal hypersurface in @xmath34",
    "in order to discuss the mean curvature flow in submanifolds , firstly , we consider the following well known proposition .",
    "note that , in this article , when a manifold @xmath39 is a submanifold in a riemannian manifold @xmath40 then we denote @xmath41 the second fundamental form of @xmath39 in @xmath42 and @xmath43 the levi - civita connections on @xmath42 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "hence @xmath44    [ prop ] let @xmath45 @xmath0 be submanifolds in @xmath16 suppose that @xmath46 is a submanifold in @xmath34 put @xmath47 to be the mean curvature vector of @xmath46 in @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be the mean curvature vector of @xmath46 in @xmath50 fix @xmath51 then @xmath52where @xmath53 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath54 hence we can see that @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath57 to @xmath58    the reader can try to prove proposition [ prop ] or skip the proof below if it is already done .    from the definitions of the mean curvature vector and the second fundamental form we have @xmath59",
    "this finishes the proof .    in the following theorem [ k ] , from a direct calculation , the submanifolds @xmath0 are lagrangian submanifold .    [ k ] let @xmath60 be an interval of @xmath61 and @xmath62 be a smooth function .",

    "a bit of information is below .",
