    "first - generation stars can be a source of both the observed metals in the early universe and ultraviolet photons that cause the cosmological reionization .",
    "in fact , substantial metal enrichment has been observed in ly@xmath6 clouds as early as @xmath7 ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ; songaila 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the wmap satellite has measured the electron scattering optical depth of @xmath8 , which corresponds to very early reionization at @xmath9 ( bennett et al .",
    "the growing evidence , though still indirectly , suggest that first - generation stars did play a significant role in the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "undisputedly the most decisive evidence for the first star formation is the direct detection of ongoing formation events .",
    "first star - forming clouds are considered to be bright in h@xmath0 line emission because the first stars are formed by gravitational collapse of primordial clouds , which is induced by h@xmath0 line cooling ( saslow & zipoy 1967 ; peebles & dicke 1968 ; matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ) .    in this paper , we evaluate the h@xmath0 line emission associated with first - generation star formation .",
    "similar work includes that by kamaya & silk ( 2002 ) and by ripamonti et al .",
    "they , however , have followed only the evolution in the earlier phase of star formation , namely the runaway collapse phase , and have not extended their calculations well into the later phase , namely the main accretion phase . here , we study the observational appearance in both evolutionary phases .",
    "we have found that the maximum value of h@xmath0 line luminosity is indeed attained in the main accretion phase .    currently , several next - generation large observational facilities , including _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) , _ space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( _ spica _ ) , and _ atacama large millimeter array _ ( _ alma _ ) , are awaited .",
    "one of their major scientific goals is to explore the formation and evolution of pregalactic objects in the high - redshift universe . among them , _ spica _ is the most relevant to our purpose since it has the best sensitivity in the mid- to far - infrared ranges , where the strongest h@xmath0 emission lines from the typical epoch for first star formation ( @xmath10 ) are redshifted . in this paper",
    ", we therefore discuss the detectability of those h@xmath0 line photons by _ spica_.    the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , the method of calculation is described . in section 3 ,",
    "the results for h@xmath0 emission from a forming first star are presented . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , a brief summary is given and the detectability of first - generation stars by _ spica _ is discussed .",
    "from the viewpoint of dynamical evolution , it is convenient to consider the star formation process as two distinct phases , i.e. , before and after the birth of the central protostar .",
    "these two phases are respectively called the runaway collapse phase and the mass accretion phase . because of their vastly different dynamical natures , we treat these two phases separately and use different models for describing dynamics in each phase .",
    "since the typical timescale for gravitational collapse , the free - fall time , depends inversely on density , the denser region collapses faster and becomes even denser relative to the rest . as a result , only the density in the central densest region increases , leaving the surrounding matter , or the envelope , almost unevolved .",
    "this central region has a flat density distribution with a diameter given approximately by the central local jeans length @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the envelope has the power - law density distribution , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance from the center and @xmath14 is the effective adiabatic coefficient ( larson 1969 ) . during the runaway collapse phase , the jeans mass @xmath15 decreases monotonically .",
    "note , therefore , that matter that is a part of the central region but is off - set from the center at the beginning will be left behind at some instance during the collapse , and will be incorporated thereafter into the envelope .    considering this nature of dynamics ,",
    "we use the following assumption for evolution in this phase : only when the matter is inside the central region , i.e. , @xmath16 , the physical quantities are assumed to evolve and the physical quantities outside do not evolve until the end of this phase . the radius of the central region is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is a correction factor of order unity and its value will be given below . in this way , only with the evolution of central quantities , we can know the density and velocity structure of the entire cloud .",
    "the central evolution is assumed to be described by the free - fall relation modified by the pressure gradient : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density at the center and the free - fall time , @xmath20 , is @xmath21 here , the modification due to the finite pressure gradient force is represented by the correction factor @xmath22 .",
    "next we consider appropriate values for the correction factors @xmath6 , and @xmath22 .",
    "omukai & nishi ( 1998 ; on1998 hereafter ) have studied the formation of the first stars by radiative hydrodynamics assuming the spherical symmetry and have found that larson - penston - type similarity solution for @xmath23 ( yahil 1983 ) is a good approximation for the actual collapse dynamics . for the larson - penston solutions , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the asymptotic central value of the ratio of the pressure gradient force ( per unit mass ) , @xmath26 , to the gravitational force , @xmath27 for the larson - penston - type similarity solution .",
    "the relations above can be derived from the following consideration : the ratio @xmath25 is inversely proportional to @xmath28 ; @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pressure and @xmath31 is the mass in the core .",
    "if @xmath32 , i.e , the diameter of the core is equal to the jeans length , the pressure force exactly balances the gravity , i.e. , @xmath33 . thus @xmath34 . if the pressure gradient force is neglected , the collapse timescale is the free - fall time @xmath35 . in our case ,",
    "the acceleration is reduced by a factor of @xmath36 from the gravitational acceleration as a result of the pressure force . then , by replacing the gravitational constant @xmath37 in the free - fall timescale to @xmath38 , the collapse timescale is @xmath39 .",
    "that is , @xmath40 . for @xmath23",
    ", @xmath41 then we use @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      at very high density ( @xmath44 ) , because of the lack of an efficient cooling mechanism , the temperature rises adiabatically and the increased pressure gradient force eventually halts the central collapse . at this stage , a hydrostatic core , or a protostar , is formed . the formation of the protostar marks the onset of the main accretion phase .",
    "although the protostar is small ( @xmath45 ) at its birth , it grows by many orders of magnitude in mass due to accretion of the envelope matter .",
    "after protostar formation , the pressure gradient force in the envelope becomes negligible in comparison with the gravitational force .",
    "then we assume that the infall of the envelope matter proceeds according to the free - fall rate after the protostar formation .",
    "the evolution of each mass shell is given by @xmath46 where @xmath13 , @xmath47 , and @xmath19 are the distance from the center , the velocity , the density of a free - falling mass shell , and @xmath48 is the mass contained inside the mass shell , respectively . in this case , the density of a mass shell increases as @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of each mass shell until the beginning of @xmath50 dissociation : because of the increasingly short timescale and reduced h@xmath0 abundance , time - averaged @xmath50 emissivity during the @xmath50 dissociation is only a negligible fraction of the entire emissivity .",
    "the thermal evolution is followed by applying the energy equation to each fluid element : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath53 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath54 is the mass of the hydrogen nucleus .",
    "the net cooling rate @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the rate of cooling by @xmath50 line emission , @xmath58 is the net rate of cooling by continuum emission and @xmath59 is the net rate of cooling by chemical reactions .    the line cooling rate @xmath57 is treated as in omukai(2000 ) , where the cooling rate owing to optically thick lines is reduced according to the escape probability formalism .",
    "the optical depth @xmath60 of a line is evaluated locally by that for the shielding length @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the velocity dispersion . as a source of the velocity dispersion ,",
    "we consider only the thermal motion : , and then @xmath63 . we use the relation for the homogeneous collapse @xmath64 for the runaway collapse phase and the free - fall velocity @xmath65 for the main accretion phase .",
    "the net continuum cooling rate @xmath58 consists of the sum of cooling term by continuum emission and the heating term by continuum absorption .",
    "both terms are treated as in omukai(2001 ; eq . b27 ) , but , for the heating term , we consider the radiation field from the central protostar . as mentioned below , because of the low effective temperature of the photosphere , @xmath58 contributes to cooling , rather than to heating , as a whole . in our calculation , we assume that the protostellar radiation is the diluted black body of 6000k from the photospheric radius of 100@xmath66 . the photospheric radius is fixed at 100@xmath66 for simplicity .",
    "but , in reality , it varies dramatically during the accretion phase , as pointed out by omukai & palla ( 2003 )",
    ". however , the radiation field of the photosphere influences the thermal state in falling mass shells only moderately because of the low effective temperature of the photosphere , and this simple treatment does not affect our results significantly .",
    "major chemical reactions between hydrogen compounds h , h@xmath0 , h@xmath67 , h@xmath68 , and @xmath69 are solved . included are reactions 1 , 2 , and 7 - 22 in omukai ( 2000 ) with the same rate coefficients .",
    "helium compounds are not included since they are thermally inactive in the temperature range in our calculation . the chemical cooling rate @xmath59 , which is mainly owing to @xmath50 formation and dissociation , is also treated as in omukai ( 2000 ) .",
    "we neglect the external radiation field for simplicity . in the accretion phase",
    ", the radiation comes from the luminous central star .",
    "however , in the spherical accretion , the uv radiation is not strong , because of the low effective temperature of the star .",
    "also the h@xmath0 column density well exceeds the value needed for the self - shielding of dissociating photons .",
    "thus , in our model , photoionization and photodissociation are not important and not included .",
    "we use an assumption similar to that in section 2.1.1 : the physical quantities , such as temperature and chemical composition , of the envelope remain constant until the end of the collapse phase . with this prescription , we can know the temperature and chemical composition distribution of the entire cloud as well as the density and velocity structure .",
    "therefore , we can infer @xmath50-line emission from a certain position in the envelope using the same method described above for calculating the emission from the central region .",
    "summing the emissivity from the central region and from the envelope , we obtain the the @xmath50 line luminosity of the entire star - forming core at each step .",
    "the fragmentation of metal - free gas clouds and formation of star - forming cores have been investigated by some authors ( e.g. , uehara et al .",
    "1996 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ; abel et al . 2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) . as the initial condition for our calculation",
    ", we adopt the typical values for the star - forming cores from bromm et al.(2002 ) : the number density @xmath70 , temperature @xmath71 , electron abundance @xmath72 and h@xmath0 abundance @xmath73 .",
    "this condition corresponds to the jeans mass of @xmath74 .",
    "in figure 1 the evolution of ( a ) the temperature and ( b ) the @xmath50 concentration are shown against the number density .",
    "the evolution of the central region in the collapse phase is shown by the solid curve .",
    "for the accretion phase , the evolution of three representative mass shells is indicated .",
    "first , we describe evolution in the runaway collapse phase : in this phase , while the number density increases by about ten orders of magnitude , the temperature rises only by an order , owing to the radiative cooling by h@xmath0 ( see fig 1 a ; e.g. , palla , salpeter and stahler 1983 ; on1998 ) .",
    "the rapid increase in the abundance of h@xmath0 around @xmath75 is owing to the three - body reaction ( palla et al .",
    "1983 ) . as a result of this ,",
    "most of the hydrogen in the central region has been in the molecular form before the number density reaches @xmath76 .",
    "next , let us consider the accretion phase : in this phase , the temperature is higher and the h@xmath0 concentration is lower than those in the runaway collapse phase for the same density .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : during the accretion phase , the compression timescale of each mass shell is shorter than that in the runaway collapse phase for the same density .",
    "this causes a rapid temperature rise . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath50 dissociation starts before the formation of sufficient molecular hydrogen for cooling .",
    "the four strongest h@xmath0 lines in our calculation are rovibrational lines of 1 - 0q(1 ) , 1 - 0o(3 ) , pure rotational lines of 0 - 0s(4 ) and 0 - 0s(3 ) to @xmath77 , q denotes that the change of rotational level , @xmath78 , is 0 .",
    "similarly , s and o denote @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the number in the bracket denotes rotational level after the transition .",
    "] , whose wavelengths at rest are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the evolution of those line luminosities is shown in figure 2 . during the runaway collapse phase ,",
    "pure - rotational lines are stronger than rovibrational lines .",
    "in contrast to this , in the accretion phase , the rovibrational lines become stronger than pure - rotational lines because of the high temperature and density in this phase .",
    "note that the luminosities of both rovibrational and pure - rotational lines reach the maximum in the accretion phase .",
    "the peak values of the line luminosities @xmath84 and the mass of the protostar at this epoch @xmath85 are shown in table i.    c|c|c|c + line & @xmath86(@xmath87 ) & @xmath84(@xmath88erg / s ) & @xmath85(@xmath89 ) + 1 - 0q(1 ) & 2.34 & 1.73 & 12.9 + 1 - 0o(3 ) & 2.69 & 1.71 & 11.2 + 0 - 0s(4 ) & 8.27 & 0.78 & 7.4 + 0 - 0s(3 ) & 10.03 & 1.05 & 10.5 +    here we discuss why the line luminosities are stronger in the accretion phase than in the collapse phase .",
    "the possible sources of energy radiated by the @xmath50 emission include the gravitational energy liberated by the infall and the chemical binding energy liberated by @xmath50 formation . before the peak of luminosity , the main source is the latter .",
    "the majority of the former turns into kinetic energy without being converted to radiation energy . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the chemical binding energy liberated by @xmath50 formation is converted into thermal energy on the spot , since the number density is high enough to assure the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( @xmath90 ) in our calculation .",
    "the evolution of the liberation rate of chemical energy and the h@xmath0 radiation emissivity for the mass shell that contains about @xmath91 inside are shown in figure 3 .",
    "hereafter we write this mass shell as `` mass shell ( @xmath91 ) '' .",
    "as is seen in the figure , the majority of the radiated energy is indeed coming from the liberated chemical binding energy .",
    "we compare here the liberation rate of chemical energy in the collapse phase with that in the accretion phase . in figure 4 , we show the chemical energy liberated per unit time at four selected instances , the final stage of the collapse phase and three steps of the accretion phase , against the radial distance .",
    "the liberation rate of chemical energy is higher in the accretion phase than in the collapse phase .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : the radius of the h@xmath0 forming region , which is defined as the radius where the @xmath50 formation rate is maximum , decreases from @xmath92 in the collapse phase to @xmath93 when the mass of the central protostar is @xmath94 in the accretion phase . at the same time",
    "the inflow velocity and thus the mass entering into the @xmath50 formation region per unit time becomes larger in the accretion phase , i.e. the total number of h@xmath0 forming per unit time increases .",
    "since the liberated chemical binding energy is converted into radiation efficiently , the luminosity in the accretion phase exceeds that in the collapse phase .",
    "the luminosities of rovibrational lines reach their maximum at a protostellar mass of about @xmath95 ( figure 2 ) . here , we discuss why this luminosity peak appears . in figure 5 , we show the evolution of the mass shell ( @xmath95 ) inside , against the radial distance . for comparison , we also plot some of the other mass shells .",
    "when the mass of the protostar is small , despite the large emissivity per unit mass , the mass of the region appropriate for vibrational lines , where the temperature is between 1000k and 2000k , is small . on the other hand , at a later phase , owing to the fast contraction due to the strong gravity of the central protostar , the temperature rapidly reaches the h@xmath0 dissociation value ( @xmath96k ) before sufficient h@xmath0 formation .",
    "the radiative emissivity is smaller , although the mass of the emission region is larger .",
    "consequently , the luminosity peak appears at some epoch in between .    in the outer envelope where density is low",
    "( @xmath97 ) , the temperature of infalling mass shells in the collapse phase is higher by a factor of @xmath98 than the value of the larson - penston - type similarity solution for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the mass accretion rate , which depends on the temperature as @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( e.g. , stahler et al .",
    "1986 ) , becomes larger than that derived from the similarity solution by a factor of @xmath102 after the protostellar mass exceeds @xmath103 .",
    "the mass accretion rate so calculated decreases slowly from the initial value of @xmath104 to @xmath105 at the protostar mass of @xmath106 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of h@xmath0 line emission from a forming first star , starting from a prestellar dense core up to the formation of a @xmath107 protostar .",
    "after the formation of the central protostar , the h@xmath0 line luminosity increases and luminosities of strong lines reach their maximum when the central protostellar mass is @xmath108 .",
    "the four strongest @xmath50 lines are the rovibrational lines of 1 - 0q(1 ) ( @xmath80 ) , 1 - 0o(3 ) ( @xmath81 ) , the pure - rotational lines , 0 - 0s(4 ) ( @xmath82 ) , and 0 - 0s(3 ) ( @xmath83 ) . during the accretion phase ,",
    "vibrational lines of 1 - 0q(1 ) and 1 - 0o(3 ) are the strongest , while in the collapse phase the strongest lines are the pure - rotational lines .",
    "strong h@xmath0 line emission is expected also from diffuse regions in low - metallicity ( @xmath109 ) forming galaxies ( e.g. , shchekinov & ntl 1985 ; shchekinov 1991 ; omukai & kitayama 2003 )",
    ". however , the dominant lines from those sources are pure - rotational lines because of the lower density ( @xmath110 ) . on the other hand , in the late stage of the first star formation , @xmath50 rovibrational lines",
    "are dominant , because of both high density ( @xmath111 ) and temperature ( @xmath112k ) in the h@xmath0 emitting region . therefore , detection of @xmath50 rovibrational lines can be a useful method to identify first - generation star forming clouds .",
    "several large observational projects using next - generation facilities are now in progress , including _",
    "jwst _ , _ spica _ and _ alma_. the wavelength ranges of these three facilities are presented in table ii .      for typical formation epochs of the first stars @xmath116",
    "( e.g. , abel et al . 2002 ) , the emitted h@xmath0 rovibrational line photons are redshifted to the far - infrared wavelength . as is seen in table ii , _ spica _ has the deepest detection limit in this range and",
    "thus is the most suitable to our purpose .",
    "_ spica _ is a next - generation infrared satellite , which is planned to have a cooled ( 4.5k ) and large ( 3.5 m ) telescope and to be highly sensitive at the mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the line detection limit of _ spica _ is about @xmath117 in the far - infrared wavelength @xmath118 with a spectroscopic resolution @xmath119 and observation time of one hour . since a signal to",
    "noise ratio is proportional to @xmath120 , the sensitivity improves , of course , with longer integration time . nonetheless , in the mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , the high background of the zodiacal light limits the sensitivity of _ spica _ to @xmath121 ( private communication h. matsuhara ) .",
    "the wavelengths of the redshifted pure - rotational lines shown above are outside the range of any future telescope given in table iii . on the other hand ,",
    "the wavelengths of the rovibrational lines , which are intrinsically stronger than pure - rotational lines , fall in the range where the sensitivity of _ spica _ is excellent .    by using the value of peak luminosity @xmath84 in table i",
    ", the peak intensity of the strongest rovibrational lines from @xmath4 is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the luminosity distance to @xmath4 given by the formula @xmath128^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the hubble parameter , with the values @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "this peak intensity corresponds to the peak flux density of @xmath133 using the line width @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the line - center frequency for the observer and @xmath47 is the velocity of the mass shell . note that in considering a cluster of star - forming cores , a larger value of the line width should be taken because relative velocity between the cores is usually larger than the thermal velocity in a core . in this case",
    ", the peak flux density per unit core will be lower than the value given above .",
    "taking into account the limiting sensitivity @xmath121 and the maximum rovibrational line flux @xmath136 , we conclude that _ spica _ is able to observe a cluster of forming first - generation stars if it is contains more than @xmath137 sources with their luminosity near the peak value .",
    "next , we consider whether or not this situation is possible in a realistic cosmological context .",
    "the epoch of the peak luminosity lasts only for @xmath138 ( see fig 2 ) , which is by far shorter than the typical free - fall time in the pregalactic clouds ( say , @xmath139yrs ) . even in the extreme case of starburst ,",
    "star formation is a prolonged event that continues at least a free - fall timescale of the pregalactic cloud .",
    "thus , at a given time , at most only @xmath140 of the total gas mass of the pregalactic cloud is a total mass of star forming cores approximately at peak luminosity . to reach the luminosity peak",
    ", the first - star forming cores must be as massive as @xmath91 (  3 ) .",
    "the mass scale of actual cores is probably more massive , typically @xmath141 , according to numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial clouds ( e.g. , bromm et al . 2002 ) .",
    "thus the total mass of 10@xmath142 cores is @xmath143 . since only @xmath144 of all the cores",
    "are at peak luminosity , in order for 10@xmath142 cores to reach peak luminosity at the same time , the total cloud mass must be as high as @xmath145 .",
    "note also that in this case the star formation rate is required to be an improbably high value of @xmath146 .",
    "it is true that for pure - rotational lines , i.e. , 0 - 0s(3 ) , the epoch in which the luminosity is higher than @xmath147erg / s continues for as long as @xmath148yrs .",
    "although this long emission period reduces the required star formation rate , it is still improbably high ( @xmath149 ) . on the other hand , in order to emit radiation mainly in h@xmath0 lines during the prestellar collapse , especially for the very high density region , the metallicity in the pregalactic clouds must be lower than @xmath150 ( omukai 2000 ) . however , formation of galactic scale objects with such low metallicity is probably excluded in the context of standard cosmology ( scannapieco , schneider , & ferrara 2003 ) . in conclusion , it is improbable that detection of h@xmath0 line emission from forming first stars can be accomplished with _",
    "spica_.    in this paper ,",
    "the accretion flow has been assumed to be spherical . in reality , however , an accretion disk should form owing to an angular momentum barrier . in this case , the total energy emitted in @xmath151 lines might increase , since the released gravitational energy is converted more efficiently into radiation in the accretion disk . at the same time , h@xmath0 is more susceptible to photodissociation owing to direct irradiation from the star . to estimate the h@xmath0 luminosity more precisely ,",
    "it is necessary to study effects of the disk in the accretion phase .",
    "we leave this problem for future work . recently ,",
    "bromm & loeb(2004 ) performed a three - dimensional numerical simulation and derived the mass accretion rate onto the protostar .",
    "their accretion rate is similar to our value until @xmath152 yr after the protostar formation . after this time",
    ", their accretion rate drops more rapidly than ours .",
    "this difference is probably caused by more realistic evolution that they calculated , e.g. quasi - static contraction in the early evolution and/or the complex accretion flow owing to 3d effects etc . in our calculation",
    "the maximum values of the h2 luminosities are reached at @xmath153 yr after the protostar formation . at this epoch ,",
    "our accretion rate does not differ much from their value . therefore , the peak value of h2 luminosity is expected to be almost the same even if their accretion rate is adopted .",
    "after @xmath152 yr of protostar formation , we are probably overestimating the accretion rate and thus the h2 luminosity . nevertheless , the h2 luminosity at this time is already weak and does not important for our discussion on observability by future facilities .",
    "contrary to our claim , kamaya & silk ( 2002 ) and ripamonti et al.(2002 ) have concluded that future observational facilities , e.g. , _ jwst _ , _ alma _ , _ astro - f _ , are able to detect h@xmath0 emission from the first star - formation sites . here",
    "we stress that our estimated value of the peak luminosities of @xmath50 lines is larger than their value , which is attained for the earlier phase .",
    "moreover , in the mid- to far - infrared wavelengths , the sensitivity of _ spica _ that we use here to estimate the detectability exceeds that of the other facilities that these authors considered .",
    "the reason for the apparent contradiction is as follows : in converting the emitted h@xmath0 luminosity to the observed flux , they used the luminosity distance underestimated by a factor of @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the redshift of the source .",
    "this error propagates to the final value of the observed flux , which is overestimated by @xmath156 .",
    "note that , anyway , our value of the intrinsic luminosity in the runaway collapse phase is consistent with kamaya & silk ( 2002 ) and ripamonti et al.(2002 ) .",
    "finally , we touch on another future telescope , _ the single aperture far - infrared observatory _",
    "( _ safir _ ) .",
    "thanks to its larger mirror size ( 8 m ) , the line detection limit of _ safir _ is better than that of _ spica _ and the background limit of @xmath157 at @xmath158 can be reached in one hour with spectroscopy of @xmath159 .",
    "recall that the detection limit we used in this paper is also the background limit @xmath157 , which is set by the zodiacal light .",
    "therefore , even with _",
    "safir _ we conclude that detecting @xmath151 line emission from forming first stars is difficult .    the authors would like to thank tetsu kitayama , hajime susa and masayuki umemura for valuable comments , and ken - ichi oohara and kazuya watanabe for continuous encouragement .",

    "<S> molecular hydrogen line radiation emitted in formation events of first - generation stars are evaluated in a discussion of its detectability by future observational facilities . </S>",

    "<S> calculations are extended not only to the early phase of the runaway collapse but also to the later phase of accretion , whose observational features have not been studied before . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the runaway collapse phase , where the pure - rotational lines are always dominant , in the accretion phase rovibrational line emission becomes prominent . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum luminosity is also attained in the accretion phase for strong emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the peak intensity of the strongest rovibrational line reaches @xmath2 , corresponding to the flux density of @xmath3 , for a source at the typical redshift of first - generation star formation , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although the redshifted rovibrational h@xmath0 emission from such an epoch falls in the wavelength range of the next - generation infrared satellite , _ space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics _ , for exceeding the detection threshold @xmath5 such protostars are required to reach the maximum luminosity simultaneously in a pregalactic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> it is improbable that this condition is satisfied in a realistic scenario of early structure formation . </S>"
