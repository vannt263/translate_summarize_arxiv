    "the almost perfect energy transfer ( apet ) in photosynthesis phenomena , reaching the values over 95% , attracts attention of physicists in the recent years @xcite . in particular",
    ", the experimental observations of long - lasting quantum coherence in such systems @xcite suggest that the popular picture of the excitation moving stepwise from the highest to the lowest excitonic state , by means of a diffusive hopping , need not to be correct .",
    "a natural consequence of this observation is that the quantum theory of open systems should be applicable to these phenomena .",
    "indeed , a number of papers were published where the interplay between quantum coherence and environmental decoherence was considered as a plausible explanation of apet .",
    "those papers present a variety of theoretical approaches which differ by a choice of mathematical modeling of an environmental noise . in some papers",
    "markovian models of lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan are used @xcite , in others non - markovian effects has been also included using hierarchical equations of motion @xcite or certain `` time - nonlocal '' master equations @xcite . in all",
    "those models reaction center plays a passive role of a probability sink .",
    "different regimes can be observed , depending on the choice of parameters , and various optimization schemes are studied .",
    "the overall picture shows a noise - assisted enhancement of energy transport accompanied by suppression of coherent oscillations , with the exception of @xcite , where a small ensemble of molecular configurations yielding an efficient quantum transport ( slightly reduced by markovian dephasing ) , is found .    in the present paper a completely different model",
    "is proposed  a resonant , coherent energy exchange between the donor site and the acceptor one accompanied by an irreversible energy transfer to the sink ( reaction center ) .",
    "the sink plays an active role modifying the energy of acceptor to achieve a resonance with respect to a donor .",
    "the applied mathematical formalism , based on the version of wigner - weisskopf model , developed in @xcite is used .",
    "in contrast to often very elaborate numerical analysis of master equations , or even the schrdinger equation for the fmo complex and the bath , our approach employs simple analytical formulas which explicitly show a resonance apet mechanism and the necessity of fine - tuning of certain parameters .",
    "the structure of monomeric subunit of the fmo complex ( see @xcite , fig . 5 ) can be described as a cavity made of proteins containing the bchl pigments and suggests the following analogy proposed in @xcite .",
    "consider an optical cavity which consists of two parabolic mirrors with a common symmetry axis and two identical 2-level atoms placed in the focuses of the mirrors with transition dipoles parallel to the axis .",
    "a simple physical intuition suggests that when one of the atoms is excited the emitted photon will be bouncing between atoms during its lifetime which depends on the cavity quality factor .",
    "if additionally the first atom ( donor ) is excited by a light source ( say a laser ) and the second ( acceptor ) is coupled to an energy sink we obtain a mechanism of energy transfer from a source to a sink mediated by the donor - photon - acceptor system .",
    "the similar mechanism can be responsible for the efficient energy transfer in photosynthesis phenomena .",
    "two outer bchl pigments coupled to the antenna and the reaction center , respectively , are analogs of two atoms  donor and acceptor , and the other pigments together with the surrounding proteins form an environment which is the analog of electromagnetic field and supports wave - like traveling excitons  the analogs of photons . under certain resonance conditions , which for the optical analog are guaranteed by identical frequencies of both atoms , the symmetry of the cavity and the symmetry of atoms positions and orientations , the `` bouncing exciton '' can transport energy from the antenna to the reaction center .",
    "the efficiency of the process depends on two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here , @xmath0 is the probability that the energy which reaches the acceptor in `` one - shot '' is dissipated to the sink and @xmath1 is the probability of exciton recombination during the flight from the donor to the acceptor ( or back ) .",
    "the simple analysis leads to the following formula for the efficiency of energy transfer after @xmath2 bounces @xmath3^n}{1 - ( 1-q)^2 ( 1-p)}. \\label{bouncing}\\ ] ] using , the relation @xmath4 where @xmath5ps is a typical time of flight and @xmath6ns is a typical exciton recombination time one obtains @xmath7 . in the next sections we show that under reasonable conditions @xmath8 .",
    "hence , using the above choice of parameters we obtain the following estimations for the `` five - steps '' and asymptotic efficiencies @xmath9 \\simeq 0.997 \\label{bouncing1}\\ ] ] which are sufficiently high to account for the observed in nature values over 0.95 .",
    "we consider a standard tight - binding model of energy transport in quantum networks in the single - exciton approximation which is valid under the assumption that the exciton lifetime is much longer than any other relevant time scale in this model .",
    "the initial `` skeleton system '' consists of @xmath10 sites with the corresponding single - exciton hilbert space @xmath11 and the hamiltonian matrix @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the following assumptions , notation and terminology will be used :    * the diagonal elements @xmath13 are energies of the sites ( denoted by @xmath14 ) while @xmath15 are hopping amplitudes . * the sites `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' , `` n+1 '' correspond to a donor , an acceptor and a sink , respectively . *",
    "the direct coupling between the donor and the acceptor is usually small because of their spatial separation and similarly the sink is strongly coupled only to the acceptor , so we can put @xmath16 what essentially simplifies the model .    under these conditions",
    "the hamiltonian can be recasted into the form which reflects the open system character of the model @xmath17 here a donor and an acceptor form a system with the hamiltonian given by the first two terms of ( [ discreteww ] ) , the `` skeleton bath '' consists of the rest @xmath18 sites including a sink with the hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "the last terms describe the system - bath coupling , @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath19 is a submatrix of @xmath24 with indices @xmath25 , namely    @xmath26    @xmath19 can be written in its spectral decomposition form @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 correspond to the sink whose energy should be the lowest one and well - separated from the others .",
    "however , this model with the low dimensional hilbert space and hence the hamiltonian with well - separated energy levels can not describe irreversible energy transfer phenomena .",
    "we have to take into account the coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this interaction transforms the eigenstates @xmath30 into resonances with finite spectral widths ( decoherence rates ) @xmath31 . the finite - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath32",
    "is replaced by an infinite - dimensional @xmath33 and the hamiltonian ( [ spech_1 ] ) by the continuous spectrum multiplication operator by @xmath34 .",
    "we do not need to determine the exact form of the total hamiltonian denoted by @xmath35 but the whole information will be included in the form of the relevant correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the system begins its evolution in the donor state @xmath36 and after time @xmath37 can be found in the acceptor state @xmath38 with the probability @xmath39 the apet takes place if for a certain time @xmath40 the transfer probability @xmath41 .",
    "then the energy must be transferred from the acceptor to the sink in an irreversible process which is fast in comparison to the lifetime of the acceptor state .",
    "the relevant correlation functions @xmath42 are now given by @xmath43 where the presence of decoherence rates @xmath31 reflects the fact that the states @xmath30 are not the eigenstates of the modified hamiltonian @xmath44 but the unstable resonances embedded into practically continuous spectrum .",
    "in order to give a more transparent picture of apet we approximate the functions @xmath51 in ( [ approx2 ] ) by lorentzians @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the renormalized frequencies satisfy the following self - consistent equation @xmath54 the apet condition means the perfect overlap of both lorentzians what implies @xmath55 notice that due to the condition @xmath56 the renormalized frequency @xmath57 and the decay rate @xmath58 of the donor do not depend on the sink parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . therefore , the apet conditions ( [ apet ] ) can be realized by fitting the sink parameters to modify properly the renormalized frequency @xmath62 and the decay rate @xmath63 of the acceptor .",
    "the resonance condition ( [ apet ] ) implies that the exciton energy at the donor is the same as at the acceptor and equal to @xmath64 what means the absence of heating of the vibrational environment . to achieve a rapid and irreversible energy transfer from the acceptor to the sink , the acceptor - sink coupling @xmath65 and the decoherence rate for the sink @xmath61 should be much larger than the decay rate @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the parameter @xmath61 can be treated as a sum of two terms , @xmath67 where @xmath68 corresponds to the decoherence phenomena while @xmath69 describes exciton decay in the sink .",
    "in fact one should add @xmath70 to the sink energy @xmath60 and then transform the initial hamiltonian into a nonhermitian one to include this decay process .",
    "such interpretation does not change the basic formula ( [ approx1 ] ) at resonance as the imaginary part of the phase @xmath71 , due to @xmath70 , appears around the sink energy @xmath60 which is assumed to be far away from the resonance value @xmath72 . on the other hand it provides an explanation of the energy transfer irreversibility .",
    "finally , one has to discuss the influence of the oscillating factor which under the conditions ( [ lorentz ] ) and ( [ apet ] ) possesses a much simpler structure derived using the results of @xcite @xmath73 where we use the parametrization of the phase - factor in terms of @xmath74 which can be interpreted as the propagation time of the exciton wave packet , with frequencies concentrated around @xmath34 , between the donor and the acceptor . for a constant exciton velocity , i.e.",
    ", @xmath75 an optimal choice of @xmath76 gives the transition probability @xmath77 .",
    "simple numerical estimations show that for the choice @xmath78 one can reach probability @xmath79 .",
    "these relatively low probabilities are caused by the process of exciton back - scattering by the acceptor coupled to the sink . in order to explain the observed efficiencies higher than @xmath80 we need the `` bouncing exciton '' model described above . in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the values of the overlap integral @xmath81 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{efficiency}\\ ] ] for example , if @xmath82 and the presence of the phase ( [ phase ] ) introduces another factor @xmath83 , one can estimate the single - shot transfer probability as @xmath8 which is high enough to account for the observed phenomena .",
    "we apply the presented theory to the case of the fmo complex of _ c. tepidum _ using the data of @xcite . the model of fmo complex",
    "is given by the hamiltonian of type ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath84 containing @xmath85 hamiltonian submatrix taken from @xcite .",
    "we adopt a standard choice of the bchl 1 and bchl 3 molecules as the donor and acceptor , respectively .",
    "notice , that in the recent literature @xcite a new model containing eight bchl pigments is applied , however , with a still large variance between hamiltonian parameters found in the literature . as the aim of the present work is not to give the ultimate quantitative description , but rather to illustrate the new mechanism of energy transfer , we use the `` old model '' .",
    "the free parameters of the model are randomly sampled within the following intervals : @xmath86 $ ] , @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 ( all values in @xmath89 ) .",
    "the limits put on the decay rates @xmath90 , @xmath88 , are consistent with the experimental widths of absorption spectral lines obtained at the temperature @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the bound for @xmath92 is comparable to the largest energy variation in the fmo complex and the value of @xmath93 is practically unrestricted .",
    "notice , that the value of @xmath92 must be negative , in order to `` push up '' acceptor energy to achieve resonance with a donor .    under these conditions",
    "the maximal value of the factor @xmath94 and the corresponding resonance phenomenon at the point @xmath95@xmath89 is clearly visible ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) with the width @xmath96@xmath89 .",
    "the interesting feature is that the curves representing the shifted energies for the donor and the acceptor are very close in a rather wide interval of frequencies @xmath97 $ ] ( fig . [",
    "a similar behavior is observed for decay rates as well ( fig . [ fig2]a ) .",
    "it suggests that the hamiltonian of fmo complex is well - tuned to make the resonance condition less sensitive with respect to the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath92 .",
    "the efficiency dependence on these parameters is illustrated by fig .",

    "coupling @xmath93 is about three times larger than the largest value of the dipole - dipole coupling between pigments in the fmo complex .",

    "in contrast to the models based on markovian or non - markovian relaxation towards the lower energy levels in our model the exciton energy is not dissipated into vibrational environment of the fmo complex but is transfered in a resonant process to the acceptor and then transformed into other forms of energy in the reaction center .",
    "this implies the absence of heating of the vibrational degrees of freedom , which is considerably large in the standard models .",
    "namely , in those models the difference between donor and acceptor energy is dissipated into environment before the exciton can reach the reaction center .",
    "this portion of energy @xmath116@xmath89 @xmath117 per exciton , can have biological relevance and , perhaps , could be used as a test for the proposed models . on the other hand , the vibrational degrees of freedom provide the necessary `` quasi - continuous medium '' for the energy propagation .",
