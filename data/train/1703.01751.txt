    "experiments on the new generation of electron beam facilities cebaf(jefferson lab ) , mami(mainz ) , and mit - bates led to dramatic progress in the investigation of the electroexcitation of nucleon resonances , and significant role in the interpretation of new data belongs to quark models , in particular , to light - front relativistic quark models ( lf rqm ) .",
    "the clas measurements at jefferson lab made possible , for the first time , the determination of the electroexcitation amplitudes of the roper resonance @xmath8 on the proton in a wide range of photon virtuality up to @xmath9gev@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the comparison of these results with the lf rqm predictions @xcite was crucial for identification of the @xmath8 as a predominantly radial excitation of a three - quark ( 3@xmath10 ) ground state , with additional non-3-quark contributions needed to describe the low @xmath7 behavior of the amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath11 transition amplitudes have been measured in a more wide range of @xmath7 ( @xmath12gev@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained data strongly confirm the meson - cloud contribution as a source of the long - standing descreapancy between the data and quark model predictions for the magnetic - dipole form factor of this transition , and the bare contribution to this form factor , obtained within dynamical reaction model @xcite is very close to the lf rqm predictions @xcite . above @xmath13gev@xmath3 ,",
    "the lf rqm @xcite reproduces observed in experiment smallness of the ratio @xmath14 , as well the negative sign and sharply growing absolute value of the ratio @xmath15 for the @xmath11 transition .",
    "a very interesting conclusion was made from the results on the @xmath16 amplitudes extracted from clas data @xcite .",
    "a special feature of the resonance @xmath6 is the strong suppression of the transverse helicity amplitudes for its excitation through quark transition from the proton .",
    "this feature allowed one to draw conclusion regarding the dominant strength of the meson - baryon contribution to the @xmath16 transverse helicity amplitudes @xcite which is supported by the results of the dynamical coupled - channels approach @xcite .",
    "experiments on meson electroproduction on new electron beam facilities have been performed on the proton target and , in the whole , allowed extraction of the electroexcitation ampltudes for the resonances @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite in the range of @xmath7 up to @xmath18gev@xmath3 , for the @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 at @xmath21gev@xmath3 @xcite , and for the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 at @xmath26gev@xmath3 @xcite .",

    "other processes , such as @xmath29 on deuterium target and @xmath30 are also in preparation .    therefore , in the near future clas experiment will provide us with rich information on the electroexcitation of the nucleon resonances from the multiplet @xmath1 $ ] at @xmath21gev@xmath3 , and our goal in the present investigation is to extend our previous results on the electroexcitation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 within lf rqm @xcite by comprehensive investigation of electroexcitation of all resonances assigned to the @xmath1$]-plet on the proton and neutron .",
