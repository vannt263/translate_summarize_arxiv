    "the crossing point of the ropes mimics a cusp structure ( figures [ f - eruption]b and [ f - eruption]c ) . if the interacting parts of ropes b@xmath13 and b@xmath14 were infinitely long , then the direction of their mutual twisting would correspond to the `` twist '' arrow . however , the ropes stayed side - by - side in the cusp region . the dashed line in figure  [ f - eruption]b shows a field line ( flare loop ) shrinking down from the crossing point .",
    "the cusp - like features were observed in the trace 195    channel ( figures  [ f - trace_norh_june_1]f  h ,  [ f - trace_june_2]g  j ) .",
    "it is sensitive to the fexii ( 0.52  mk ) and fexxiv ( 1126  mk ) emissions ( @xcite ) .",
    "since hot features are known to be fuzzy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , the fine thready structures of the `` cusps '' imply that they were at normal coronal temperatures of about 1.5  mk .",
    "conversely , the cusp related to the reconnection site in the standard model should be hotter [ @xmath28  mk ; see , e.g. , ( ) ] , and therefore the appearance of the observed `` cusps '' does not match the expectation . also , the sxr 312 kev source in figure  [ f - summary]f probably related to the coronal null point was observed on june 1 as early as 03:5003:53 , but the `` cusp '' , which must be associated with the sxr source , was formed later ( see figures  [ f - trace_norh_june_1]e  g ) , being not co - spatial with it .",
    "thus , the `` cusps ''",
    "most likely had no relation to the inverted y - type configuration in the standard model , but were mimicked by cooler magnetic ropes .",
    "reconnection went on after the impulsive phase , because the magnetic fields at the top of the cusp - like structure became nearly antiparallel due to the stretch of the ropes .",
    "however , the reconnection rate declined because the electric currents in the ropes became also antiparallel and repelled each other .",
    "both these factors resulted in intertwisting of the ropes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the dual - rope initiation of a flare ( figure  [ f - eruption ] ) resembles the scheme proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dual - rope configuration in figure  [ f - eruption]b was distorted due to its instability to a helical twist . moreover ,",
    "the distortion of ropes b and c was also influenced by the outer magnetic structure encompassing the volume in which the events occurred .",
    "this volume resembles a `` funnel '' with a narrow waist ( see figure  [ f - configuration ] ) .",
    "the lower part of this `` funnel '' is bounded by a hemispheric separatrix surface .",
    "the optimal escape path of ejections runs through the waist .",
    "the `` magnetic funnel '' confines the ejections as suggested by the movies .",
    "the interaction of the ejections with this `` funnel '' and their pass through the waist appear to have produced a wave disturbance in the corona observed as an `` eit wave '' ( see section  [ s - disturbances ] ) rapidly expanding above the limb .    the motion of the mutually wrapped dual - rope ejection through the waist must be accompanied by reconnection of the magnetic field lines of the ejection with those of , or near to , the separatrix surface . a response to this process",
    "could be concurrent euv disturbances that propagate along the ring structure and near the remote site ( see section  [ s - disturbances ] and figure  [ f - configuration ] ) .",
    "the microwave pre - flare emission was mainly thermal , as shown by contours in figure  [ f - trace_norh_june_1-preflare ] , and the only compact microwave sources were related to the major sunspots .",
    "the ring structure appeared in microwaves , too , similarly to euv ( see figures [ f - trace_norh_june_1-preflare]c and [ f - trace_norh_june_1-preflare]d ) , indicating heating .",
    "all flaring microwave sources ( except for source 1 ) in figure  [ f - trace_mag_radio ] were non - thermal ( see figure  [ f - all_radio_timeprofs ] ) .",
    "the flare sources 2a  d were located along rope b consisting of ropes b@xmath13 and b@xmath14 ( figure  [ f - ropes_horizontal ] ) .",
    "source 2a was located in the eastern footpoint of rope b@xmath13 , where its untwisting was observed .",
    "source 2b presumably corresponded to the intersection region of ropes b@xmath13 and b@xmath14 .",
    "source 2c was associated with the western footpoint of rope b@xmath14 .",
    "the time profiles in figure  [ f - all_radio_timeprofs ] suggest the connections between all of these flare sources .",
    "their non - thermal nature and localization in ropes b@xmath13 and b@xmath14 indicate reconnection of the ropes , confirming the scheme in figure  [ f - eruption ] .",
    "the detailed correspondence of the time profiles of the non - thermal sources 2 and 3 during the first main peak ( see figure  [ f - trace_mag_radio ] ) suggests their connection .",
    "the long loops detected in the trace 195    images between sources 2 and 3 traced a magnetic channel connecting the flare and the remote sites .",
    "particles responsible for the remote microwave source 3 could arrive from the main flare site through a change in magnetic connectivity while the ejection was passing through the waist ( see sections  [ s - disturbances ] and [ s - flare_cusp ] ) .",
    "( , section 2.3 ) have not revealed in the june 2 event any x - ray emission along the western part of the ring structure ( which they called ribbon a ) .",
    "similarly , no x - ray emission from this region was detected in the june 1 event .",
    "these facts confirm our conclusion that this feature was not a flare ribbon .",
    "@xcite also noticed in the same section that the main sxr sources , as shown by rhessi at 612  kev , corresponded to the footpoints in the june 2 event , which was unusual ( see also our figure  [ f - summary]h ) .",
    "to explain this fact , @xcite suggested a low density and temperature in sxr - emitting loops , but our estimates ( section  [ s - summary_both ] ) do not confirm these assumptions .",
    "another possibility could be an enhanced brightness of overlapping legs of the loops visible at small angles to the line of sight .",
    "the rhessi sxr images in question temporally correspond to the trace 195    images in figures [ f - trace_june_2]e and [ f - trace_june_2]f , which clearly show structures with temperatures of 11.5  mk .",
    "images of hotter ( @xmath29  mk ) structures coming at the same time in the fexxiv passband of the trace 195    channel are expected to be darker and fuzzier than the 11.5  mk structures registered in its major fexii passband ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we would not be able to separate the hot and the cooler structures in the trace 195    images .",
    "however , the loops emitting at 612  kev are expected to appear at 195    after their cooling , and we simulated the sxr image from later trace 195    frames by blurring them to imitate their previous fuzziness .",
    "the result roughly resembles the rhessi image in question and demonstrates that one might deal here with an effect of integration of the column emission measure explaining the enhanced sxr brightness of the footpoint regions .",
    "the geometry of the phenomenon inspires one to assume that the appearance of the ring structure and the eruptions were caused by magnetic reconnection in the coronal null point ( see figure  [ f - configuration ] ) . in the breakout model",
    ", it is the first step initiating the eruption @xcite .",
    "however , observations in the present events did not show the role of the `` breakout '' reconnection high in the corona to be crucial in the triggering and course of the events for the following reasons .    1",
    ".   the ring structure appeared after , rather than before , the eruption of rope a. 2 .",
    "the outermost boundary of the ring structure was well - defined .",
    "reconnection in a null point would not imply such a boundary .",
    "the rise of rope b started under the almost static filament , which protected it from the influence of the `` breakout '' reconnection .    on the other hand , the rise and eruption of rope a preceded the onset of the event in sxr and euv , and the eruption onset of rope b preceded the flare in microwaves and hxr .",
    "these facts indicate that reconnection in the lower corona ( e.g. , `` tether cutting '' ) was not a major launching factor for the events .",
    "this outcome is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite , `` the tether cutting reconnection may still be occurring , but only after the eruption onset was triggered by some other process '' .",
    "unlike the standard model , in which flare reconnection is initiated by a rise of a single magnetic rope , we have discussed the initiation of the eruptive flares by reconnection of two rising ropes .",
    "this explains the location of the main flare site separated from the central , fastest - moving part of rope b@xmath13 .",
    "the dual - rope configuration mimicked the cusp , which had no relation to the hot cusp in the standard model .",
    "reconnection between the ropes explains non - thermal radio emission from the eastern footpoint of rope b , the driver of the flare .",
    "the combined multi - spectral analysis of two homologous eruptive events of 2002 june 1 and 2 allowed us to outline their common picture .",
    "similarity of the photospheric conditions and persistent photospheric flows determined the resemblance between the events .",
    "the boundary of the sites where the events occurred was a time - evolving structure visible in euv as a ring .",
    "the observations left the impression that it was not possible to perceive the scenarios of the events by considering each of them separately .",
    "we have combined all the observed facts from both these events , as if they were a single event , and proposed their common scenario . we have concluded that their major drivers were eruptions of magnetic flux ropes .",
    "neither the triggering of the events nor their evolution appear to be controlled by processes at the coronal null point .",
    "such processes were probably present , but they did not determine the initiation of the events .",
    "the standard model , the breakout model , as well as other models employing magnetic reconnection high in the corona do not help to understand these impulsive events .",
    "( ) highlighted problems in the interpretation of the 2002 june 2 event in terms of widely accepted theoretical schemes and emphasized their importance .",
    "interpretation of the two events made in our paper is based on a scheme involving the eruption of interacting flux ropes .",
    "the scheme is inherently three - dimensional and hardly reducible to the 2- or 2.5-dimensional geometry while maintaining its essence .    _",
