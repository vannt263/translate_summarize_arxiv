    "a large body of evidence pertaining to the existence of nonbaryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) has been established over the past several decades , including the large - scale distribution of galaxies ( @xcite ) , the study of primordial light element abundances ( @xcite ) , galactic rotation curves ( @xcite ) , supernova data ( @xcite ) and the power spectrum of anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( @xcite,@xcite ) . at the @xmath0 confidence level , the cdm energy density parameter is now @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a popular candidate for cdm is the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) neutralino , which is a superposition of higgsinos , winos and binos . consequently the neutralino is electrically neutral and colourless , only interacting weakly and gravitationally and therefore very difficult to detect directly . in r - parity conserving supersymmetric models the lightest neutralino ,",
    "being the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , is stable ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , in a scenario where present - day cdm exists as a result of thermal - freeze out , the dominant species of cdm is likely to include the lsp .",
    "the relic density of the lsp will then heavily depend on its mass and annihilation cross - section .",
    "the neutralino is a popular candidate for cdm because the expected values of these parameters are such that the corresponding relic densities are of the same order as the currently accepted value of @xmath2 .    in 1994 and 1995 ,",
    "the high - energy antimatter telescope ( heat ) observed a flux in cosmic ray positrons , very much in excess of theoretical predictions , and peaking close to 8gev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this observation was confirmed by a second flight by heat in 2000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effect was originally predicted in 1984 ( @xcite ) , for both cosmic ray positrons and antiprotons .",
    "while the cosmic ray antiproton feature remains elusive , at least for theorists it is now a well established idea that local dark matter annihilations are a possible source of the positrons contributing to the observed excess . of course",
    ", improved data is urgently required to validate the significance of this observation , and these are expected to be taken in the near future by experiments like pamela , ams-02 and bess polar . in this paper , we summarise why extant models for local dark matter annihilations fail to adequately account for the current spectral data on the positron feature , and present a new model .    studies in which the local ( within several kpc ) distribution of dark matter is considered to be smooth have concluded that the dark matter annihilation rate is insufficient to reproduce the observed positron flux .",
    "this naturally leads to the idea of a non - uniform , or `` clumpy '' , dark matter distribution providing the overdensities necessary to elevate dark matter annihilation rates sufficiently to produce the observed excess ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of such substructure can then be estimated through the use of simulations .",
    "unfortunately , while simulations generally agree on the distribution of dark matter clumps , there is a divergence of opinion on the survival of the lightest clumps after the effects of hierachial structure formation and tidal stripping are considered ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that throughout this paper we shall consider the lsp to be the lightst neutralino and therefore use the two terms synonymously .",
    "positrons can be produced in several neutralino annihilation modes .",
    "for example , monoenergetic positrons can result from the decay of gauge bosons produced in the processes @xmath3 or @xmath4 , producing positrons of energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the neutralino mass .",
    "a small amount of positrons can result from the direct channel , @xmath7 , however such a channel seldom makes a significant impact on the overall positron flux .",
    "a continuum of positrons , extending to much lower energies , can also be produced in the cascades of particles produced in annihilations .",
    "the spectrum of positrons produced in neutralino annihilations can vary significantly depending on the mass and annihilation modes of the lsp .",
    "if the neutralino is lighter than the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bosons , annihilations will be dominated by the process @xmath10 with a minor contribution by @xmath11 .",
    "assuming annihilations are dominated by the former process , the resulting positron spectrum will depend entirely on the mass of the lsp . for heavier lsps ,",
    "the annihilation products become more complex , often determined by several dominant annihilation modes including @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath12 as well as @xmath13 and @xmath11 . in our calculations ,",
    "the positron spectrum per annihilation per energy interval @xmath14 , uses results from pythia ( @xcite ) , implemented in the darksusy package ( @xcite ) .",
    ", for neutralinos with masses of 50 , 150 and 600 gev .",
    "dotted lines are the same , but correspond to the process @xmath15 .",
    "dashed lines correpond to the positron spectra fom the process @xmath4 , for a 150gev neutralino , where the spectrum from the process @xmath3 is very similar.,width=264 ]    in figure[annspectra ] , we display results for positron spectra from neutralino annihilations for the most important annihilation modes as produced by @xcite .",
    "solid lines represent the positron spectrum , per annihilation , for @xmath10 , for lsps with masses of 50 , 150 and 600gev .",
    "the dotted lines are the same , but from the process @xmath11 .",
    "gaugino - like annihilations typically produce a spectrum which is dominated by @xmath16 at low energies , with contributions from @xmath17 only becoming important at energies above about half the lsp mass . for neutralinos with a dominant higgsino component",
    ", annihilations to gauge bosons often dominate .",
    "dashed lines represent positron spectra resulting from the process @xmath4 for a 150gev neutralino , where the spectrum corresponding to the process @xmath3 is very similar .",
    "cosmic ray positrons being electrically charged particles diffuse through the interstellar medium ( ism ) under the electromagnetic influence of the galactic magnetic field and background radiation .",
    "the spatial distribution of the galactic magnetic field is extremely complex , resulting in positron trajectories which are well approximated to random walks .",
    "whilst traversing the ism , the positrons radiate through synchrotron losses owing , to the surrounding magnetic fields , and by inverse compton scattering off of starlight and cmb background radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusion - loss equation describing the above process is given by    @xmath18 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e_{e^+ } } \\left[b(e_{e^+},{\\bf r})\\frac{\\partial n_{e^+}}{\\partial e_{e^+}}\\right ] +   q(e_{e^+},{\\bf r } ) ,   \\label{1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the number density of positrons per unit energy interval , @xmath20 is a diffusion coefficient , @xmath21 is the rate of energy loss and @xmath22 is the source term .",
    "we parameterize the diffusion coefficient and the rate of energy loss as follows    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    based upon measurements of stable nuclei in cosmic rays ( primarily by fitting to observations of the boron to carbon ratio ) ( @xcite ) , where in equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we have assumed a spatially uniform galactic magnetic field .",
    "we then define @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be constant within a `` diffusion zone '' , which here is considered to be a radially - infinite cylindrical slab of thickness @xmath274kpc , which is the best - fit to observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we solve equation ( [ 1 ] ) for the local positron flux , using the proceduce described in the appendix to this paper .",
    "in order to directly compare our results to the observations made by heat , we must calculate the ratio of the local positron flux to the combined local positron and electron fluxes , called the `` positron fraction '' . in order to do this",
    "we require the background spectra for secondary positrons , primary electrons and secondary electrons , where we propose that the primary positron component originates from the neutralino annihilations . in the following , we make use of the parameterised fits to these spectra calculated by @xcite and stated here ( in units of @xmath28 ) , as follows :    @xmath29    again where @xmath30 .",
    "these equations agree with their respetive observational results to within 10 - 15% for the relevent energy intervals .",
    "( for a more detailed account of the precision of these equations , refer to @xcite . )",
    "the positron fraction is then calculated using    @xmath31",
    "the standard cosmological model assumes that all structure in the universe originated from small amplitude quantum fluctuations during an epoch of inflationary expansion shortly after the big bang .",
    "the linear growth of the resulting density fluctuations is then completely determined by their initial power spectrum    @xmath32    where for @xmath33 , clumps are formed with a wide range of scales @xmath34 . during the expansion of the universe ,",
    "smaller clumps coalesce to form larger ones in a process of `` bottom - up '' hierarchical structure formation , in which the mass distribution at any given redshift can be determined through the use of numerical simulations .",
    "in this paper we utilise the mass distribution of clumps deduced from the high - resolution simulations conducted by diemand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , of the form @xmath35log@xmath36 $ ] .",
    "diemand et al . deduced a lower mass cut - off @xmath37 , however we shall also investigate the effect of using a much larger value , of order @xmath38 ( similar to the typical mass resolution of conventional large - scale numerical simulations ) , to simulate the destruction of lighter clumps by merging .",
    "we normalise the distribution so that the number density of clumps between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is 500pc@xmath41 , with a halo - to - halo scatter factor of approximately 4 , as stated by diemand et al .. we also invoke an upper mass cut - off , @xmath42 , defined so that heavier clumps possess a number density of less than 1 per unit volume within the region in which positrons contribute to the local flux .",
    "the rate of dark matter annihilations within a clump crucially depends on its density profile . in this study",
    "we adopt the widely used navarro , frenk & white ( hereafter , nfw ) density profile ( @xcite )    @xmath43 ^ 2 } , \\label{8}\\ ] ]    which is consistent with simulated results for the outer regions large - scale halos .",
    "the nfw profile also provides a good fit to those of the lightest clumps produced in the simulations by diemand et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum radius of a clump is defined here to be the radius , @xmath44 , at which its density is equal to 200 times the critical density .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath45 is a further degree of freedom , found to lie between @xmath46 for the clumps in diemand et al.s simulations . since the relationship beteween clump mass and concentration is complex , we approximate that all clumps have the same concentration and we compare results when using @xmath47",
    ".    since the simulations conducted by diemand et al . were terminated at @xmath48 , even though there is reason to believe that the shape of the mass distribution of clumps is similar today for large mass scales ( @xcite ) , we must also consider mass losses from tidal stripping by stars as clumps traverse the galactic halo . in this study",
    "we consider a scenario where the fractional mass loss experienced by each clump , over a given duration , is a mass - independent constant @xmath49 and we compare results when using several different values of this parameter .",
    "the notion of a universal tidal stripping parameter is consistent with the calculation by zhao et al . , who demonstrates that    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the average stellar densiity along the clump orbit , @xmath52 is an effective `` core '' density of the clump and @xmath53 is the time period considered . since the majority of clumps have similar orbital parameters ( @xcite ) , and since we have adopted a universal clump profile , equation ( [ 9 ] ) implies that @xmath54 is mass - independent .",
    "we consider four different neutralino models :    first , a 50gev neutralino with an annihilation branching ratio of 0.96 to @xmath16 and 0.04 to @xmath17 .",
    "such a particle could be gaugino - like or higgsino - like , since for masses below the gauge boson masses , these modes dominate for either case ( designated as model1 ) .",
    "second , we consider two cases for a 150gev neutralino .",
    "one which annihilates as described in model1 ( designated as model2 ) , and another which annihillates entirely to gauge bosons , @xmath55 or @xmath56 ( designated as model4 ) .",
    "such neutralinos are typically gaugino - like and higgsino - like respectively .",
    "finally we consider heavy , 600gev neutralinos , which annihilate to @xmath16 with a ratio of 0.87 and to @xmath17 or @xmath57 the remaining time ( designated as model3 ) .",
    "( we note that even though we do not explicitely calculate results for a model involving 600gev higgsino - dominated neutralinos , which primarily decay to gauge bosons and partially to higgs bosons , the resulting positron spectra per annihilation is likely to be very similar to that of model3 ) .",
    "although these models do not fully encompass the extensive parameter space available to neutralinos at present , they do describe effective mssm benchmarks .",
    "furthermore , the relevant results for neutralinos with a mixture of the properties of those above can be inferred by interpolating between those presented .",
    "96% of the time and @xmath58 to @xmath17 ( designated as model1 ) .",

    "the solid line represents the spectra which best fits the data .",

    "dashed lines represent the spectra corresponding to the 1@xmath60 fits to the observations , where the normalisation of the positron flux was considered to be a free paramter .",
