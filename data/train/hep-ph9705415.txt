    "it should be recalled that the off - diagonal entries in the singlet evolution matrices @xmath26 interchange their role when going from the space- to the time - like case , see , e.g. , @xcite .    as a manifestation of the so - called gribov - lipatov relation @xcite the space- and time - like",
    "splitting functions are equal in lo .",
    "furthermore they are related by analytic continuation of the space - like splitting functions ( drell - levy - yan relation ( acr ) @xcite ) which can be schematically expressed as @xmath27 @xmath28 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the operation @xmath29 analytically continues any function to @xmath30 and correctly adjusts the color factor and the sign depending on the splitting function under consideration @xcite , e.g. , @xmath31 these lo relations are based on symmetries of tree diagrams under crossing , and should be therefore no longer valid when going to nlo .",
    "fortunately @xcite , the breakdown of the acr arising beyond lo is essentially due to kinematics and can be rather straightforwardly detected within the light - cone gauge method used in @xcite to calculate the space - like splitting functions .",
    "the general strategy of the light - cone gauge method is based on a rearrangement of the perturbative expansion of a partonic cross section into a finite hard part and a process-_in_dependent part @xmath32 which contains all ( and only ) mass singularities @xcite . using dimensional regularization",
    "the @xmath33 evolution kernels appear order by order as the residues of the _ single _",
    "@xmath34 poles in @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the space- and the time - like @xmath32-kernels essentially amounts to relative extra phase space factors ( @xmath35 ) in the time - like case dimensions . ]",
    "all this gives on aggregate for @xmath36 for the ac of the spin - dependent space - like kernels @xcite @xmath37 obviously , higher @xmath38 pole terms in @xmath39 will generate additional contributions to the relevant _ single _ pole part of @xmath40 if combined with the factors @xmath41 in ( [ eq1 ] ) . to extract the contributions that break the acr one can easily go through the nlo calculation of the @xmath39 @xcite graph by graph picking up all @xmath42 pole terms .",
    "apart from the slightly subtle case of the so - called ladder - subtraction topology @xcite this is a rather straightforward task @xcite . to obtain the desired final result for @xmath43 @xcite",
    "one has to combine the results of the ac of the nlo splitting functions @xmath44 @xcite , by using the operation @xmath45 $ ] defined above , with the contributions that break the acr . finally , the missing endpoint contributions , i.e. , the terms @xmath46 , are exactly the same as in the space - like situation @xcite . in the same way",
    "the hard subprocess cross sections @xmath47 in ( 2 ) can be obtained via analytic continuation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the final results for the @xmath43 and @xmath47 are too long to be listed here but can be found in ref .",

    "the rather simple and transparent structure of the acr breaking part is a hint that there could be a more straightforward way of linking the time- and the analytically continued space - like nlo quantities .",
    "the key observation for such considerations is to notice that although the usual 4-dim .",
    "lo splitting functions obey the acr rule , the rule must break down for their @xmath48-dimensional counterparts as an immediate consequence of eq.([eq1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the breakdown of the acr beyond lo in the @xmath33 scheme is entirely driven by this breaking such that it can be accounted for by a simple factorization scheme transformation @xcite .    finally , our results for @xmath43 ( as well as the corresponding unpol .",
    "results given in @xcite ) fulfil the so - called susy relation which links all singlet splitting functions in a remarkably simple way in the limit @xmath49 ( cf .",

    "the validity of the susy relation @xcite serves as an important check for the correctness of our results .",
    "the most likely candidate for a measurement of polarized fragmentation functions is the @xmath0 baryon due to its self - analyzing decay @xmath50 . in @xcite",
    "a strategy was proposed for extracting the @xmath51 in sia @xmath52 . at high enough energies ,",
    "no beam polarization is needed since the parity - violating coupling @xmath53 automatically generates a net polarization of the quarks . in fig .",
    "1a we compare the first results for such a measurement of the cross section asymmetry @xmath54 on the @xmath55-pole by aleph and delphi @xcite with two conceivable nlo models for the @xmath51 ( the corresponding lo results are very similar ) @xcite .",
    "scenario 1 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , is based on the naive quark model whereas for scenario 2 we also allow for a non - vanishing @xmath58 input as discussed in @xcite . in both cases",
    "the inputs for the evolution are specified at some low starting scale @xmath59 ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite where also a model for the unpolarized @xmath60 can be found ) .    apart from sia the possibility of extracting the @xmath51 in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) , i.e. , @xmath61 , has also been discussed recently @xcite . here , either a longitudinally polarized lepton beam or a polarized nucleon target would be required .",
    "such kind of measurement appears possible e.g. for the hermes experiment @xcite . in fig .",
