    "_ tree - width _ , measuring the similarity of a graph with a tree , has turned out a to be an important notion both in structural graph theory and in the theory of graph algorithms .",
    "it is well known that planar graphs may have arbitrarily large tree - width . however , for every fixed @xmath5 the class of planar graphs of diameter at most @xmath5 has bounded tree - width . in other words ,",
    "the tree - width of a planar graph can be bounded by a function of the diameter of the graph .",
    "this makes it possible to decompose planar graps into families of graphs of small tree - width in an orderly way .",
    "such decompositions of planar graphs , better known under the name _ outerplanar decompositions _ , have been explored in various algorithmic settings @xcite .",
    "the main ideas go back to a fundamental article of baker @xcite on approximation algorithms on planar graphs .",
    "the _ local tree - width _ of a graph @xmath0 is the function @xmath1 that associates with every @xmath2 the maximal tree - width of an @xmath3-neighborhood in @xmath4 .",
    "more formally , we define the _ @xmath3-neighborhood _ @xmath6 of a vertex @xmath7 to be the set of all @xmath8 of distance at most @xmath3 from @xmath9 , and we let @xmath10 denote the subgraph induced by @xmath4 on @xmath6 .",
    "then , denoting the tree - width of a graph @xmath11 by @xmath12 , we let @xmath13 we are mainly interested in classes of graphs of _ bounded local tree - width _ , that is , classes @xmath14 for which there is a function @xmath15 such that for all @xmath16 and @xmath2 we have @xmath17 .",
    "the class of planar graphs is an example .",
    "it has been observed by eppstein @xcite that if a class @xmath14 is closed under taking minors and has bounded local tree - width ( eppstein calls this the `` diameter - treewidth property '' ) , then the graphs in @xmath14 admit a decomposition into graphs of small tree - width in the style of the outerplanar decomposition of planar graphs , and the planar - graph algorithms based on this decomposition generalize to graphs in @xmath14 .",
    "eppstein gave a nice characterization of such classes ; he proved that a minor closed class @xmath14 of graphs has bounded local tree - width if , and only if , it does not contain all apex graphs .",
    "the main graph - theoretic result of this paper , theorem [ theo : minorclosed ] , can be phrased as follows : let @xmath14 be a minor closed class of graphs that does not contain all graphs .",
    "then all graphs in @xmath14 can be decomposed into a tree of graphs that , after removing a bounded number of vertices , have bounded local tree - width .",
    "( of course the converse is also true , but trivial : if @xmath14 is a minor closed class of graphs such that every graph in @xmath14 admits such a decomposition , then @xmath14 is not the class of all graphs . )",
    "the proof of this result is based on a deep structural characterization of graphs with excluded minors due to robertson and seymour @xcite .",
    "we defer the precise technical statement of our decomposition theorem to section  [ sec : minclosed ] and turn to its applications now . in this paper",
    ", we focus on approximation algorithms . but let me mention that the theorem can also be used to re - prove a result of alon , seymour , and thomas @xcite that graphs @xmath4 with an excluded minor have tree - width @xmath18 ( see section  [ sec : ast ] ) .",
    "actually , the main result of alon , seymour , and thomas s article is a separator theorem for graphs with an excluded minor , generalizing a well - known separator theorem due to lipton and tarjan @xcite for planar graphs .",
    "these separator theorems have numerous algorithmic applications , among them a polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for the  problem on planar graphs @xcite and , more generally , classes of graphs with an excluded minor @xcite .",
    "a different approach to approximation algorithms on planar graphs is baker s @xcite technique based on the outerplanar decomposition",
    ". it does not only give another ptas for , but also for other problems , such as , to which the technique based on the separator theorem does not apply .",
    "we can use our decomposition theorem to extend baker s approach to arbitrary classes of graphs with an excluded minor .",
    "our purpose here is to explain the technique and not to give an extensive list of problems to which it applies .",
    "we show in detail how to get a ptas for  on classes of graphs with an excluded minor and then explain how this ptas has to be modified to solve the problems  and",
    ". it should be no problem for the reader to apply the same technique to other optimization problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : prel ] we fix our terminology and recall a few basic facts about tree - decompositions of graphs . local tree - width is introduced in section  [ sec : ltw ] . in section  [ sec : minclosed ] , we prove our decomposition theorem for classes of graphs with an excluded minor .",
    "approximation algorithms are discussed in section  [ sec : aa ] , and in section  [ sec : appl ] we briefly explain two other applications of the decomposition theorem .",
