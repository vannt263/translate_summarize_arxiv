    "2003 ) , the symmetric profile of the absorption light curve clearly suggests an interpretation in terms of line - of - sight crossing by an individual cloud .",
    "the transitions we are discussing in this paper , however , represent a different phenomenology , whereby the apparent variation of the absorbing column density is of at least one order - of - magnitude , and the state corresponding to the lower x - ray flux is fully reprocessing - dominated .",

    "we do not consider    the contribution of compton - shoulder , which is likely to be @xmath77 in most cases @xcite .",

    "this implies that a typical timescale for these transitions should be @xmath6750  years , on the basis of the average separation between the asca / bepposax and the closest _ chandra_/xmm - newton observations .",
    "of course , given the size of our sample , this has to be regarded as no more than an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "however , it is consistent with previous determinations , based on inhomogeneous and incomplete samples .",
    "the origin of the spectral changes occurring when an agn transforms its appearance from a `` transmission- '' to a `` reprocessing - dominated '' state is still not fully elucidated . in principle , high - quality , high - resolution measurements , following the onset of the variability or the agn recovery after a prolonged `` off - state '' should be decisive .",
    "in ngc  6300 and ngc  2992 we have the strongest evidence that transitions from transmission- to reprocessing - dominated states are due to a change of the optical path through which the nucleus is being observed , due to a temporary interruption of the nuclear activity . in ngc  6300",
    "this is suggested by the very large compton - reflection continuum observed by bepposax @xcite . in ngc  2992 ,",

    "when one is dealing with x - ray unobscured agn a bias toward brightest , less obscured object , may prevent us from discovering the fraction of x - ray unobscured counterparts to our  transient \" compton - thick seyferts .",

    "the application of this method to the five known transitions is summarized in fig .",

    "possibly in ugc  4203 , the spectrum observed during a reprocessing - dominated state is too hard to be due to compton - reflection by matter with the same column density as measured by the soft photoelectric cut - off during transmission - dominated states .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to ngc  6300 , on the basis of its x - ray spectrum above 10  kev ( guainazzi 2002 ; matt et al .",
    "the gas responsible for line - of - sight absorption should be therefore different in density from the gas responsible for reflection , the latter being most likely located at the far inner side of the molecular `` torus '' .",
    "this may be explained by a largely inhomogeneous compact ( _ i.e. _ , 1  pc ) nuclear absorber @xcite , or by compton - thin absorption occurring on much larger scales than the nuclear `` torus '' , _ e.g. _ in dusty regions associated with starburst formation @xcite , or with the host galaxy ( maiolino & rieke 1995 ; malkan et al .",
    "an extension of the seyfert unified scenario , which encompasses the latter possibility is discussed by matt ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in 3 out of 5 cases the sr in fig .",

    "this possibility is confirmed by a detailed spectral analysis of the bepposax observation of ngc  2992 , the x - ray brightest among the objects displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where the recovery of the agn is witnessed by a comparatively small value of the normalization ratio between the reflected and the transmitted component [ @xmath81 ) ] with respect to a bare compton - reflection dominated state .    in summary , the spectral properties of ",

    ", one can not discard the idea of a compact but inhomogeneous pc - scale  torus \" @xcite , or disk outflow @xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneities might be the ultimate responsible for these transitions .",
    "however , the fact that photoionized- or starburst - dominated soft x - ray emission in several seyfert  2 galaxies is absorbed as well ( iwasawa & comastri 1998 ; matt et al . 2001 ; 2003a ) , alongside our knowledge of the x - ray history in ngc  6300 and , above all , ngc  2992 , suggests that an important contribution to x - ray obscuration comes from matter associated to the host galaxy , beyond the innermost pc around the central engine .",
    "our program was not specifically tuned to investigate the origin of the soft x - ray emission in our sample .",
    "the answers that we get from the data on this issue are therefore inevitably ambiguous in almost all cases .",
    "the only exception is ngc  5005 ( the only non compton - thick source in the sample ) . in this case , the soft x - ray emission is clearly extended on scales comparable with the optical size of the galaxy , and roughly aligned with its main axis , or with an inner arm uv structure . for all the other cases , the two proposed scenarios are equally viable on the basis of the epic data alone .",
    "whenever high - resolution spectroscopic data are available , soft x - rays appear to be dominated by emission lines following photoionization and photoexcitation by the primary agn emission ( kinkhabwala et al .",

    "( 2004a ) for a more detailed discussion on this point , we conclude for the time being that a throughout determination of the physical properties of the plasma dominating the soft x - rays in obscured agn requires deep exposures with high - resolution detector , which are currently possible only on a limited number of objects .",

    "bearing this caveat in mind , it seems that once or twice every century we might be forced to change our x - ray absorption classification for each highly obscured agn .",

    "( 2003b ) .",
    "although an explanation in terms of varying line - of - sight column density can not be ruled out , the fact that in the best studied cases these transitions are associated with large ( @xmath8210 ) fluctuations of the agn x - ray output suggests that they are due to a change of the optical path through which we observe the nucleus . for the transition specifically discussed in this paper - ngc  4939 - the factor of 2 variation of the observed 210  kev",

    "<S> we present _ chandra _ and xmm - newton observations of a small sample ( 11 objects ) of optically - selected seyfert  2 galaxies , for which asca and bepposax had suggested compton - thick obscuration of the active nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",

    "<S> this indicates a typical occurrence rate of at least @xmath00.02  years@xmath1 . these transitions could be due to large changes of the obscuring gas column density , or to a transient dimming of the agn activity , the latter scenario being supported by detailed analysis of the best studied events . </S>",
    "<S> independently of the ultimate mechanism , comparison of the observed spectral dynamics with monte - carlo simulations demonstrates that the obscuring gas is largely inhomogeneous , with multiple absorbing components possibly spread through the whole range of distances from the nucleus between a fraction of parsecs up to several hundreds parsecs . as a by - product of this study , we report the first measurement ever of the column density covering the agn in ngc  3393 ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) , and the discovery of soft x - ray extended emission , apparently aligned along the host galaxy main axis in ngc  5005 . </S>",
