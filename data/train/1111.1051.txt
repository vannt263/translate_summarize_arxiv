    "have been shown to be achievable using ia @xcite .",
    "although ia provides a substantial asymptotic capacity gain in interference channels , there are many practical challenges for implementation .",
    "ia requires global channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) , and imperfect channel knowledge severely degrades the gain of ia . in some channel configurations",
    ", symbols should be extended in the time / frequency domain to align interfering signals .",
    "the high computational complexity is also considered as a major challenge . to ameliorate these difficulties ,",
    "many ia algorithms have been proposed such as iterative ia @xcite and a subspace ia @xcite .    for interference suppression , multiuser diversity",
    "can also be exploited by opportunistic user selection for minimizing interference .",
    "the interference reduction by multiuser diversity can be enjoyed without heavy burden on global channel knowledge because user selection in general requires only a small amount of feedback @xcite . in this context ,",
    "opportunistic interference alignment ( oia ) has been recently proposed in @xcite and has attracted much attention . in a 3-transmitter @xmath4 mimo interfering broadcast channel ( ibc ) , the authors of @xcite proved that @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 $ ] ) dof per transmitter is achievable when the number of users scales as @xmath7 . in @xcite and @xcite , a @xmath0-transmitter @xmath8 simo ibc and a @xmath0-transmitter @xmath9 simo ibc",
    "have been studied , respectively . for simo interfering multiple access channel ( imac ) constituted by @xmath0-cell uplink channels with @xmath10 transmit antennas and single antenna users , the authors of @xcite showed that @xmath11 dof are achievable when the number of users scales as @xmath12 . in these schemes ,",
    "user dimensions are used to align the interfering signals ; each transmitter opportunistically selects a user whose interfering signals are most aligned among the users associated with the transmitter .",
    "contrary to the conventional opportunistic user selection techniques @xcite , the oia scheme exploits the multiuser dimensions for interference alignment .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the optimal role of multiuser diversity for the target dof in the ibc with @xmath0-transmitters and generalize the results of @xcite@xcite . for the @xmath0-transmitter simo ibc ,",

    "once after @xmath0-transmitters select their serving users , a @xmath0-user ic is constructed .",
    "each user has @xmath14 antennas less than or equal to the number of interferers , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , without help of multiuser diversity , interference at each user can not be perfectly removed so that the achievable rate of each transmitter goes to zero as signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) increases .",
    "consequently , the achievable dof per transmitter becomes zero .",
    "however , non - zero dof per transmitter is achievable by exploiting multiuser diversity as the number of users increases .    since opportunistic user selection can focus on either enhancing the desired signal or decreasing interference , non",
    "- zero dof can be obtained by properly enhancing the desired signal strength and reducing interference via user selection .",
    "that is , the non - zero dof @xmath16 comprises a dof gain term @xmath17 from the desired signal and a dof loss term @xmath18 caused by interference such that @xmath19 , and the target dof @xmath16 can be obtained by a proper combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "however , many questions remain unsolved ; what is the feasible and optimal combination of @xmath22 for the target dof @xmath23 and what is the sufficient number of users for the target dof achieving strategy .",
    "we answer these fundamental questions and analytically investigate how the multiuser dimensions can be optimally exploited for the target dof in the ibc . specifically , from geometric interpretation of interfering channels , we define an interference alignment measure that indicates how well interference signals are aligned at each user .    using the interference alignment measure",
    ", we first consider the @xmath0- transmitters simo ibc and show that the dof gain term @xmath20 can be achieved if the number of users scales in terms of transmit power @xmath24 as @xmath25 and the dof loss term can be reduced to @xmath21 if the number of users scales as @xmath26 . from these results , we find the optimal strategy of exploiting multiuser diversity for the target dof @xmath16 in terms of the required number of users ; the optimal target dof achieving strategies @xmath27 are @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the target dof @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 , respectively .",

    "first , each transmitter is assumed to have a single antenna , i.e. , @xmath55 , and serves a single user selected in its user group so that @xmath0-transmitter simo ic is opportunistically constituted .",
    "the system model with multiple transmit antennas ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) becomes statistically identical with the single transmit antenna model if each transmitter uses a random precoding vector . in section [ sec : extension ] , we extend our system model to the @xmath0-transmitter mimo ibc where each transmitter with multiple antennas serves the multiple users through orthonormal random beams .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the cases that the number of receive antennas is smaller than the number of transmitters , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. , if @xmath58 ) , each user can suppress all interfering signals through zero - forcing like schemes so that dof one is trivially guaranteed at each transmitter .",
    "we also assume that collaboration or information sharing among the transmitters is not allowed . since the user selection at each transmitter is independent of the other transmitters ,",
    "we only consider the achievable rate of the first transmitter without loss of generality .",
    "note that the average achievable rate per transmitter will be same if the configurations of the transmitters are identical .",
    "at the first transmitter , the received signal at the @xmath53th user denoted by @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the vector channel from the @xmath62th transmitter to the @xmath53th user whose elements are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "assuming perfect channel estimation at each receiver , the channel state information @xmath67 is available at the @xmath53th user .",

    "will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "since no information is shared among the transmitters , each transmitter independently selects a single user based on the collected information .",
    "let @xmath71 be the index of the selected user at the first transmitter .",
    "then , the average achievable rate of the first transmitter is given by @xmath72 we decompose @xmath73 into two terms @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , which are given , respectively , by @xmath77 then , the achievable dof of the first transmitter becomes @xmath78 we call @xmath79 and @xmath80 as _ dof gain term _ and _ dof loss term _ , respectively .",
    "the achievable rate of each transmitter depends on the number of users because multiuser dimensions are exploited for a rate increase .",
    "when there are fixed number of users , the achievable rate of each transmitter will be saturated in the high snr region due to interferences because the number of receive antennas at each user is smaller than the number of total transmitters .",
    "consequently , the first transmitter can not obtain any dof , i.e. , @xmath81 in this case , both the dof gain term and the dof loss term become one , i.e. , @xmath82 on the other hand , when the transmit power is fixed , the achievable rate of the selected user can increase to infinity as the number of users increases , i.e. , @xmath83 then , how much dof can be achieved when both the number of users and the transmit power increase ?",
    "obviously , non - zero dof can be obtained by exploiting multiuser dimensions , and the achievable dof @xmath84",

    "since the function is an increasing function of @xmath99 and a decreasing function of @xmath100 , for an increase of , the multiuser dimension should be used for increasing @xmath99 , for decreasing @xmath100 , or mixture of them .",
    "this fact results in .",
    "lemma 1 provides a basic guideline of using the multiuser dimension ; multiuser diversity should not be used for either decreasing dof gain term or increasing dof loss term . since the optimal target dof achieving strategy is obtained in the reduced set of candidate strategies , we consider the dof gain term larger than one and dof loss term smaller than one , i.e. , @xmath101 and @xmath102 $ ] , in the latter parts of this paper .",
    "in our system model , each user suffers from @xmath1 interfering channels which is larger than or equal to the number of receive antennas , i.e. , @xmath103 . since the interfering channels are isotropic and independent of each other , they span @xmath14-dimensional space .",
    "thus , the whole signal space at the receiver is corrupted by interfering signals , and hence the dof loss term becomes one if no effort is made to align interfering signals . on the other hand , the dof loss can be reduced by aligning interfering signals in smaller dimensional subspace .",
    "for example , if the interfering signals are perfectly aligned in @xmath104-dimensional subspace , they can be nullified by postprocessing so that we can make the dof loss zero .",
    "the transmitter can exploit the multiuser dimensions to align interfering signals by simply selecting a user whose interfering channels are most aligned .",

    "<S> this paper investigates how multiuser dimensions can effectively be exploited for target degrees of freedom ( dof ) in interfering broadcast channels ( ibc ) consisting of @xmath0-transmitters and their user groups . </S>",
    "<S> first , each transmitter is assumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where each user has receive antennas less than @xmath0 . in this case , a @xmath0-transmitter single - input multiple - output ( simo ) interference channel ( ic ) is constituted after user selection . without help of multiuser diversity </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 interfering signals can not be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive antennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers . only with proper user selection , non - </S>",
    "<S> zero dof per transmitter is achievable as the number of users increases . through geometric interpretation of interfering channels , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the multiuser dimensions have to be used first for reducing the dof loss caused by the interfering signals , and then have to be used for increasing the dof gain from its own signal . </S>",
    "<S> the sufficient number of users for the target dof is derived . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how the optimal strategy of exploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection schemes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the single transmit antenna case is extended to the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) ibc where each transmitter with multiple antennas serves multiple users .    </S>",
