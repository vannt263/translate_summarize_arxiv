    "the recent experimental realizations of the so - called lvy glasses @xcite as well as `` lvy waveguides '' @xcite has refreshed the interest in the study of systems characterized by lvy - type disorder ( see for example refs .",
    "that is , disorder characterized by random variables @xmath17 whose density distribution function exhibits a slow decaying tail : @xmath18 for large @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ( this kind of probability distributions are known as @xmath7-stable distributions @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the study of this class of disordered systems dates back to lloyd @xcite , who studied spectral properties of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice described by a 3d tight - binding hamiltonian with cauchy - distributed on - site potentials [ which corresponds to the particular value @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ pofepsilon ] ) ] .",
    "since then , a considerable number of works have been devoted to the study of spectral , eigenfunction , and transport properties of lloyd s model in its original 3d setup @xcite and in lower dimensional versions @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the comparison between the one - dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model ( 1dam ) @xcite and the 1d lloyd s model , since the former represents the most prominent model of disordered wires @xcite .",
    "indeed , both models are described by the 1d tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath21 ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the length of the wire given as the total number of sites @xmath22 , @xmath23 are random on - site potentials , and @xmath24 are the hopping integrals between nearest neighbors ( which are set to a constant value @xmath25 ) . however , while for the standard 1dam ( with white - noise on - site disorder @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) the on - site potentials are characterized by a finite variance @xmath28 ( in most cases the corresponding probability distribution function @xmath29 is chosen as a box or a gaussian distribution ) , in the lloyd s model the variance @xmath30 of the random on - site energies @xmath23 diverges since they follow a cauchy distribution .",
    "it is also known that the eigenstates @xmath31 of the _ infinite _ 1dam are exponentially localized around a site position @xmath32 @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\label{psi }    @xmath8 is the eigenfunction localization length . moreover , for weak disorder ( @xmath34 ) , the only relevant parameter for describing the statistical properties of the transmission of the _ finite _ 1dam is the ratio @xmath35 @xcite , a fact known as single parameter scaling .",
    "the above exponential localization of eigenfunctions makes the transmission or dimensionless conductance @xmath0 exponentially small , i.e. ,  @xcite @xmath36 thus , this relation can be used to obtain the localization length .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown that eq .",
    "( [ linfeff ] ) is also valid for the 1d lloyd s model @xcite implying a single parameter scaling , see also @xcite .",
    "it is also relevant to mention that studies of transport quantities through 1d wires with lvy - type disorder , different from the 1d lloyd s model , have been reported .",
    "for example , wires with scatterers randomly spaced along the wire according to a lvy - type distribution were studied in refs .",
    "concerning the conductance of such wires , a prominent result reads that the corresponding probability distribution function @xmath10 is fully determined by the exponent @xmath7 of the power - law decay of the lvy - type distribution and the average ( over disorder realizations ) @xmath37 @xcite ; i.e. ,  all other details of the disorder configuration are irrelevant . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath10 shows _",
    "universality_. moreover , this fact was already verified experimentally in microwave random waveguides @xcite and tested numerically using the tight - binding model of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with @xmath38 and off - diagonal lvy - type disorder @xcite ( i.e. ,  with @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) distributed according to a lvy - type distribution ) .",
    "it is important to point out that 1d tight - binding wires with power - law distributed random on - site potentials , characterized by power - laws different from @xmath4 ( which corresponds to the 1d lloyd s model ) , have been scarcely studied ; for a prominent exception see @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper we undertake this task and study numerically the conductance though disordered wires defined as a generalization of the 1d lloyd s model as follows .",
    "we shall study 1d wires described by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) having constant hopping integrals , @xmath39 , and random on - site potentials @xmath23 which follow a lvy - type distribution with a long tail , like in eq .",
    "( [ pofepsilon ] ) with @xmath20 .",
    "we name this setup the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder .",
    "we note that when @xmath4 we recover the 1d lloyd s model .    therefore , in the following section we shall show that ( i ) the conductance distribution @xmath10 is fully determined by the power - law exponent @xmath7 and the ensemble average @xmath37 ; ( ii ) for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , bimodal distributions for @xmath10 with peaks at @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are obtained , revealing the coexistence of insulating and ballistic regimes ; and ( iii ) the probability distribution @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14 , for vanishing @xmath0 , with @xmath16 .",
    "since we are interested in the conductance statistics of the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder we have to define first the scattering setup we shall use : we open the isolated samples described above by attaching two semi - infinite single channel leads to the border sites at opposite sides of the 1d wires .",
    "each lead is also described by a 1d semi - infinite tight - binding hamiltonian . using the heidelberg approach",
    "@xcite we can write the transmission amplitude through the disordered wires as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the wave vector supported in the leads and @xmath46 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath47 . here , @xmath48 is a @xmath49 vector that specifies the positions of the attached leads to the wire . in our setup ,",
    "all elements of @xmath48 are equal to zero except @xmath50 and @xmath51 which we set to unity ( i.e. ,  the leads are attached to the wire with a strength equal to the inter - site hopping amplitudes : @xmath52 ) .",
    "also , we have fixed the energy at @xmath53 in all our calculations , although the same conclusions are obtained for @xmath54 .",
    "then , within a scattering approach to the electronic transport , we compute the dimensionless conductance as @xcite @xmath55 .     as a function of @xmath6 for the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder ( symbols ) .",

    "[ fig1](a ) the ensemble average @xmath37 as a function of @xmath6 for the 1dam with lvy - type disorder for several values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that @xmath73 for all the values of @xmath7 we consider here .",
    "therefore , we can extract the localization length @xmath8 by fitting the curves @xmath37 vs.  @xmath6 with eq .",
    "( [ linfeff ] ) ; see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this behavior should be contrasted to the case of 1d wires with off - diagonal lvy - type disorder @xcite which shows the dependence @xmath74 when @xmath75 at @xmath53 @xcite .    also , we have confirmed that the cumulants @xmath76 obey a linear relation with the wire length @xcite , i.e. , @xmath77 where the coefficients @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , characterize the lyapunov exponent of a generic 1d tight - binding wire with on - site disorder .",
    "we have verified the above relation , eq .",
    "( [ ck ] ) , for @xmath80 , 2 , and 3 ; as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we present the results for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath6 for different values of @xmath7 .",

    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show different conductance distributions @xmath10 for the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder for fixed values of @xmath37 ; note that fixed @xmath37 means fixed ratio @xmath35 .",
    "several values of @xmath7 are reported in each panel .",
    "we can observe that for fixed @xmath37 , by increasing @xmath7 the conductance distribution evolves towards the @xmath10 corresponding to the 1dam with white noise disorder , @xmath67 , as expected .",
    "the curves for @xmath67 are included as a reference in all panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as red dashed lines @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath10 already corresponds to @xmath67 once @xmath82 .",
    "we recall that for 1d tight - binding wires with off - diagonal lvy - type disorder @xmath10 is fully determined by the exponent @xmath7 and the average @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to ask whether this property also holds for _ diagonal _ lvy - type disorder .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show @xmath10 for the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder for several values of @xmath7 , where each panel corresponds to a fixed value of @xmath37 . for each combination of @xmath37 and @xmath7 we present two histograms ( in red and black ) corresponding to wires with on - site",
    "random potentials @xmath83 characterized by two _ different _ density distributions @xcite , but with the same exponent @xmath7 of their corresponding power - law tails .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that for each value of @xmath7 the histograms ( in red and black ) fall on the top of each other , which is an evidence that the conductance distribution @xmath10 for the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder is invariant once @xmath7 and @xmath37 are fixed ; i.e. ,  @xmath10 displays a universal statistics .",
    "moreover , we want to emphasize the coexistence of insulating and ballistic regimes characterized , respectively , by the two prominent peaks of @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath84 . this behavior , which is more evident for @xmath41 and @xmath40 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , is not observed in 1d wires with white - noise disorder ( see for example the red dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this coexistence of opposite transport regimes has been already reported in systems with anomalously localized states : 1d wires with obstacles randomly spaced according to lvy - type density distribution @xcite as well as in the so - called random - mass dirac model @xcite .",
    "finally , we study the behavior of the tail of the distribution @xmath13 .",
    "thus , using the same data of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot @xmath13 .",
    "as expected , since @xmath10 is determined by @xmath7 and @xmath37 , we can see that @xmath13 is invariant once those two quantities ( @xmath7 and @xmath37 ) are fixed ( red and black histograms fall on top of each other ) .",
    "moreover , from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we can deduce a power - law behavior : @xmath85 for @xmath15 when @xmath86 . for @xmath82 , @xmath13 displays a log - normal tail ( not shown here ) , expected for 1d systems in the presence of anderson localization .",
    "actually , the behavior ( [ plng ] ) was already anticipated in @xcite as @xmath87 for @xmath15 with @xmath88 ; which in our study translates as @xmath89 ( since @xmath90 ) with @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , we have validated the last inequality in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we report the exponent @xmath92 obtained from power - law fittings of the tails of the histograms of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we have observed that the value of @xmath92 depends on the particular value of @xmath37 characterizing the corresponding histogram of @xmath13 . also , from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we note that @xmath93 as the value of @xmath37 decreases .     for the 1dam with lvy - type on - site disorder .",
    "same parameters as in fig .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath95 .",

    "in this work we have studied the conductance @xmath0 through a generalization of lloyd s model in one dimension : we consider one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding wires with on - site disorder following a lvy - type distribution , see eq .",
    "( [ pofepsilon ] ) , characterized by the exponent @xmath7 of the power - law decay .",
    "we have verified that different cumulants of the variable @xmath97 decrease linearly with the length wire @xmath6 . in particular",
    ", we were able to extract the eigenfunction localization length @xmath8 from @xmath9 .",
    "then , we have shown some evidence that the probability distribution function @xmath10 is invariant , i.e. ,  fully determined , once @xmath7 and @xmath5 are fixed ; in agreement with other lvy - disordered wire models @xcite .",
    "we have also reported the coexistence of insulating and ballistic regimes , evidenced by peaks in @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath84 ; these peaks are most prominent and commensurate for @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "additionally we have shown that @xmath13 develops power - law tails for @xmath15 , characterized by the power - law @xmath92 ( also invariant for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath5 ) which , in turn , is bounded from above by @xmath98 .",
