    "in problems concerning flexible polymers in disordered media , disorder seems to play a more important role than the conformational properties of the polymers [ 1 - 12 ] .",
    "the effect is usually manifested in the size of the polymer , which in a simple but rather unrealistic case of gaussian chains in a random potential , is found to be independent of the chain length @xmath0 .",
    "the radius of gyration in three dimensions simply scales as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a typical cut off length and plays the ( undetermined ) role of the segment size , and @xmath3 is the disorder strength at a given system volume . the problem , however ,",
    "is academic mainly on two accounts : firstly , the effects due to excluded volume interactions are completely ignored , and secondly the effects of finite extensibility are not captured by the infinitely flexible gaussian chains .",
    "it is conceivable that the inclusion of these effects , though nontrivial , can modify our present understanding of the problem .",
    "an effort in this direction has recently been made by accounting for the effects of excluded volume interactions @xcite .",
    "the results show that a chain undergoes a delocalization transition as the strength of the self - avoiding interaction is increased . since localization is usually considered as filling up of the entropic traps",
    " created by randomness  with polymeric materials , it is understandable that a self - avoiding chain can fill these holes up to a density close to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the monomer density ) before delocalizing and moving to the next hole . for gaussian chains , on the contrary , delocalization does not occur simply because they have an infinite stored length and no limit up to which the holes can be filled .    in this paper",
    "we address the second of the above mentioned problems , i.e. , semiflexible polymers in a random environment .",
    "since semiflexible polymers are finitely extensible , the theory rectifies the infinitely flexible gaussian chain model and serves as a useful description for localization of chains with varying degrees of flexibility .",
    "in contrast to gaussian chains , localization of semiflexible polymers depends rather strongly on the conformational properties of the polymer , i.e. , the ease with which a chain can bend and eventually adopt highly packed folded states . while a polymer localizes at a certain fixed strength of the disorder , it can get delocalized with an increase in the stiffness which can be brought about by decrease in the temperature .",
    "a chain of a given fixed stiffness , on the other hand , can get delocalized with the increase in the disorder strength .",
    "the interplay of the disorder strength and bending energy is instrumental in bringing about localization of semiflexible polymers .",
    "the following section reviews the salient features of the wormlike chain ( wlc ) model ; it provides a general criterion for localization of a semiflexible chain in random environment using simple scaling arguments .",
    "section iii summarizes the analytical difficulties involved in treating the wlc model and discusses the weiner model for stiff chains .",
    "section iv presents a rigorous analysis of semiflexible chains in random media using the one step replica symmetry breaking calculations .",
    "the results are summarized in section v. the details of the one step replica symmetry calculations are included in appendix a.",
    "the configurational statistics of a semiflexible polymer is described by the wormlike chain model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a chain is considered as a continuous curve of total length @xmath0 parameterized by an arc length variable @xmath6 .",
    "the variation of the unit tangent vector @xmath7 at different points along the curve with respect to the arc length variable determines the energy cost of bending [ 15 - 24 ] . to the lowest scalar order in @xmath8 ,",
    "the bending energy is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the persistence length of the polymer .",
    "it is a measure of the distance over which bond vectors are correlated , and hence determines the effective stiffness of the chain . in general , the correlation between the unit tangent vectors at two different points along the chain backbone decays exponentially , and is given by @xmath13 the persistence length is related to the bending energy @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "if such a chain interacts with @xmath16 randomly distributed obstacles , the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the position vector of a segment at distance @xmath6 from one end of the chain ; and @xmath19 is the position vector of the @xmath20th obstacle .",
    "@xmath21 is the potential that describes the interaction between the polymer and the obstacles , the form of which is yet to be specified .",
    "if the obstacle density @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 the potential can simply be written as @xmath24 = \\int d{\\bf     r } w[{\\bf r}(s)-{\\bf r } ] \\rho({\\bf r}).\\ ] ] at the simplest level of description , the obstacle density can be assumed to have a gaussian distribution @xcite : @xmath25 = \\exp\\left(- \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d{\\bf r }   \\frac { ( \\rho({\\bf r } ) - \\rho_{0})^2}{\\rho_{0}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mean obstacle density given by @xmath27 to describe the effect of the disorder , one needs to perform an average over the obstacle density .",
    "since the average is quenched , the estimation of the free energy relies on a difficult task of computing the average of the logarithm of the partition function @xmath28 .",
    "the problem is usually circumvented by introducing @xmath29 independent replicas of the initial system such that @xmath30 the replicated partition function can easily be averaged over the gaussian random potential given by eq . ( 6 ) to yield @xmath31 \\exp[- \\beta { \\cal h}_{n}],\\ ] ] where the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath32 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 = \\int d{\\bf r } w[{\\bf r_{\\alpha}}(s)-{\\bf    r } ] w[{\\bf r_{\\beta}}(s^{\\prime } ) - { \\bf r}]\\ ] ] if the interaction between the polymer and the obstacles is assumed to be short ranged , i.e. , @xmath34 \\propto \\delta({\\bf r})$ ] , then the potential can be expressed in terms of the natural scales , i.e. , @xmath35 . in writing the last expression for @xmath36 , we have introduced a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath37 , which in general contains microscopic details .",
    "the natural ( short ) lengthscale defined in the problem is the persistence length @xmath12 itself .",
    "therefore , we can express the scaling of the potential in terms of the persistence length ; this makes the second term of eq .",
    "( 10 ) dimensionless , as should be the case @xcite .",
    "having substituted this form of the potential , the effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and has the dimensions of length .",
    "formally the second term in the above expression can be interpreted as a random potential which acts along the contour of the chain ; it is a starting point of many studies on polymers in a disordered environment ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the present study ,",
    "the use of an array of obstacles instead of a random potential introduces a natural length scale in terms of the mean distance between the obstacles , @xmath40 .",
    "it turns out to be useful since this length scale can directly be compared with the persistence length in various physical situations .",
    "let us proceed by providing a rough estimate of the different energies involved using simple scaling arguments .",
    "this can be done by dimensional analysis of the above hamiltonian . in the case of annealed average",
    "there is no coupling between various replicas , that is @xmath41 , and the replica trick is not necessary . the free energy in three dimensions scales as @xmath42 the first term accounts for the bending energy penalty ( per @xmath43 ) for a chain of length @xmath0 .",
    "it is typically defined as the ratio of the bending force constant @xmath44 (= @xmath12 ) to the radius of curvature @xmath45 .",
    "note that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ annealed ] ) corresponds to the bending energy per thermal energy of a semiflexible chain .",
    "the derivative of the tangent vector @xmath46 is nothing but the local curvature .",
    "the second term corresponds to excluded volume type interactions between the chain segments , which by virtue of the disorder average , are effectively attractive . in the annealed case",
    "the problem is similar to a semiflexible chain with attractive interactions .    in the case of quenched disorder ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a coupling between various replicas and the free energy scales as @xmath47 where the second term in eq .",
    "( [ quenched0 ] ) describes a typical energy barrier of the quenched random potential ; it is usually estimated as the root of the variance using simple dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the volume of system .",
    "the issue of finite system volume is important for the case of quenched disorder since in an infinite random medium quenched and annealed disorders lead to the same results @xcite . in what follows",
    "it is assumed that the system volume is much larger than the polymer dimensions @xmath50 .",
    "the minimum of quenched free energy estimate yields the following result for the size of the chain , @xmath51 which , as in the limit of totally flexible chains , does not depend on the chain length itself but is completely determined by the disorder and the persistence length . although the size turns out to be similar to that of a gaussian chain , its dependence on @xmath12 instead of @xmath2 suggests a natural condition on the dimensionless ratio @xmath52 . that this indeed is the case can be seen from the following arguments : when the chain is reasonably stiff @xmath53 and @xmath54 can at most be of the order of @xmath0 , which immediately implies that @xmath55",
    "; in the limit of sufficiently flexible chains , it is expected that @xmath56 , which implies @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to the upper cut - off on the size @xmath54 , there is a lower cut - off , which is important for a flexible chain and suggests that @xmath54 can not be less than the persistence length @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath58 therefore implies @xmath59 . for a flexible chain , i.e. , @xmath60 , the latter constraint together with the constraint @xmath55",
    "can be summarized as @xmath61 the second inequality implies that @xmath62 , which suggests that as the chain become stiffer it localizes at progressively lower density of the disorder @xmath26 . in other words , since @xmath63 the chain is localized as long as its persistence length @xmath12 is less than the mean separation between the obstacles @xmath64 .",
    "it is to be noted that the size of the chain has a simple interpretation in terms of the obstacle density .",
    "this can be seen by substituting @xmath65 into eq .",
    "( [ locsize1 ] ) to produce @xmath66 .",
    "then the criterion for localization , as discussed above , is simply given by the comparison between the persistence length and the mean distance between the obstacles .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a gaussian chain undergoes a continuous decrease in its size with an increase in the obstacle density since the chain can be packed without limit into the cavities formed by the obstacles . in the presence of excluded volume interactions , however , a gaussian chain can fill this cavity only up to a point before delocalizing and moving on to the next cavity ; at high obstacle density the chain eventually localizes by forming pearl necklaces ( as discussed in ref .",
    "the present theory shows that a semiflexible chain _ without _ excluded volume interactions can delocalize when the obstacle density and persistence length are related by eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "this is in marked constrast to the infinitely flexible gaussian chain which can delocalize only when aided by the excluded volume interaction . in",
    "what follows we shall study the localization - delocalization transition of a semiflexible chain in the absence of excluded volume interactions , paying special attention to the flexible limit ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we will show that even in the flexible limit , new physics arises because the persistence length defines a lower cut - off length scale which is absent in the gaussian chain .",
    "we will also compare our results in this limit to earlier results for the gaussian chain .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) provides a general criterion for the delocalization of a polymer with varying degree of flexibility .",
    "the next section addresses some of the difficulties involved in treating the wormlike chain model and presents a simplified model to treat semiflexibility .",
    "the wormlike chain model , though a proper description of semiflexible polymers , suffers from its analytical intractability in a large number of applications due to the constraint of finite extensibility , i.e. , @xmath67 $ ] . in many of the practical problems , therefore , it is customary to relax the local constraint of unit tangent vector with the global constraint @xmath68 [ 17 - 24 ] , producing a rather simple model in which the chain hamiltonian has a connectivity term along with the bending energy term : @xmath69 the mean square end - to - end distance obtained using the above hamiltonian is identical with that of the wormlike chain model when @xmath70 and @xmath71 [ 17 - 24 ] .",
    "the correlation between the unit tangent vectors , when calculated from the above hamiltonian , is of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the comparison of the above equation with eq .",
    "( 2 ) suggests that the persistence length for this approximate model for stiff chains is smaller by a factor of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this is not a serious concern in the context of the present problem since the gaussian model contains the essence of semiflexiblity , i.e. , finite extensibility , while remaining analytically tractable .",
    "moreover , the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath75 becomes less important in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "as before , we begin by writing down the free energy for this simplified model using dimensional analysis or flory - imry - ma arguments which includes the wiener stretching term : @xmath76 as expected , when the first term is ignored , and the free energy is minimized with respect to @xmath45 , one obtains @xmath77 .",
    "however , the wiener - term allows for more entropy , and it is natural to ask for perturbation around @xmath54 . we look for solutions of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a small correction . when eq .",
    "( 16 ) is minimized with respect to @xmath45 , and eq .",

    "( [ locsize2 ] ) reduces to @xmath83 although these scaling arguments appear to be reasonable and in accord with the physical intuition , the appropriate conditions and justifications remain to be recovered from a more rigorous analysis .",
    "the next section presents a systematic approach to this problem using feynman variational method in replica space . since for delocalized phases",
    "the replica symmetry breaking is no longer essential , the idea is to see if criteria for localization and delocalization can be derived from standard replica techniques using one step replica symmetry breaking .",

    "the importance of weak replica symmetry breaking was recognized by one of us earlier @xcite , where a special field theoretic description of polymers in strong disorder was used . in general , for problems concerning random potentials with short range correlations , one step replica symmetry breaking has been found to be a sufficient description @xcite . in what follows , therefore , we employ one step replica symmetry breaking to estimate the size of a semiflexible polymer in a quenched random distribution of obstacles .    from eq .",

    "we propose a phase diagram for several possible compact states of the localized polymer by comparing their surface energies .",

    "minimization of the free energy with respect to @xmath45 yields @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where the volume constraint , @xmath177 , has been used .",

    "comparison of the surface energy penalty of a toroid @xmath180 with respect to a sphere @xmath181 suggests @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the surface tension .",
    "as expected , for high disorder strength , @xmath172 , and , @xmath184 , the chain prefers to be in a globular state . in the opposite limit",
    "the chain adopts a toroidal state .",
    "when the disorder strength is high , a chain can pack densely only if it chooses a mean direction that a given distribution of obstacles imposes .",
    "in other words , a high obstacle density favors anisotropy in structures , and it seems unlikely that under these conditions a polymer can adopt uniformly bent states like globules or toroids .",
    "it is physically intuitive , however , that if the polymer is able to localize for moderate persistence lengths , it can do so by producing many hairpins in a small available volume .",
    "the hairpins are the abrupt reversals in the direction of the chain from the mean ordering direction and result from the balance between the elastic penalty that favors gradual bends , and orientational field that favors rapid reversal in the alignment of the chain in the preferred direction .",
    "the energy costs for forming a hairpin is given by @xcite @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the coupling constant of a ( mean - field ) maier - saupe potential between the aligned chain segments @xcite .",
    "since @xmath186 depends on the microscpic details , a simple dimensional analysis of the above equation shows that @xmath186 can at most be of the order of @xmath187 .",
    "the free energy for this case is given by @xmath188 where we have assumed that the number of hairpins @xmath189 must be resolved in a self - consistent way , i.e. , @xmath190 . by minimizing the the free energy with respect to @xmath45",

    ", we have accounted for the fact that the average length of the chain in directions parallel to the mean ordering direction scales as @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out then that for high disorder strength and @xmath184 a chain prefers to form many hairpins . in the opposite limit toroidal state is favored .",
    "the results are summarized in the form of a schematic phase diagram in fig .",
    "it clearly shows the dominance of hairpins at moderate persistence length and high disorder strength ; for small and large persistence lengths the chain conformation is dominated by uniformly bent shapes like globules and toroids respectively .",
    "we interpret our results to suggest that the interplay between the two length scales  the persistence length of the chain and the average separation between the obstacles  serves to localize a semiflexible polymer in a random distribution of obstacles .",
    "as long as the disorder density is low , the mean separation between the obstacles is larger than the persistence length , and the chain is localized ; but as soon as the disorder explores the length scales of the order of the persistence length the chain delocalizes since the energy penalty for bending exceeds the energy gain in binding . on the contrary , when the density of obstacles is kept fixed , delocalization can be brought about by varying the temperature . while the ease of localization of a semiflexible chain can be enhanced by increase in the temperature ( corresponding to the decrease in the persistence length ) , a localized flexible chain can be delocalized by lowering the temperature .",
    "once the polymer is localized it adopts a highly compact folded state by forming hairpins for moderate persistence length and high disorder strength ; globules and toroids are favored for small and large persistence lengths respectively .    although the idea was to present a general theory for localization of semiflexible polymers ,",
    "there is one respect in which the present formalism could be seen to have limitations , and that is the use of the gaussian approximation for stiff chains , which fails to adequately describe the rigid rod limit .",
    "nevertheless , given the range of systems that can be described by flexible chain models , this theory holds out the possibility of addressing several realistic problems , for instance , the immobilization of biopolymers on surfaces with random interactions .",

    "<S> our theory provides a general criterion for the delocalization of polymers with varying degrees of flexibility and allows us to propose a phase diagram for the highly folded ( localized ) states of semiflexible polymers as a function of the disorder strength and chain rigidity . </S>"
