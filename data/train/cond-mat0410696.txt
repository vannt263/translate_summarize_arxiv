    "detection of laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) and beam depletion ( bd ) signals upon laser excitation provides a sensitive spectroscopic technique to investigate electronic transitions of chromophores attached to @xmath2he droplets.@xcite while most of atomic and molecular dopants submerge in helium , alkali atoms ( and alkaline earth atoms to some extent@xcite ) have been found to reside on the surface of @xmath2he droplets , as evidenced by the much narrower and less shifted spectra when compared to those found in bulk liquid @xmath2he.@xcite this result has been confirmed by density functional ( df)@xcite and path integral monte carlo ( pimc)@xcite calculations , which predict surface binding energies of a few kelvin , in agreement with the measurements of detachment energy thresholds using the free atomic emissions.@xcite the surface of liquid @xmath2he is only slightly perturbed by the presence of the impurity , which produces a `` dimple '' on the underlying liquid .",
    "the study of these states can thus provide useful information on surface properties of he nanodroplets complementary to that supplied by molecular - beam scattering experiments.@xcite hence , alkalis on the surface of helium droplets are ideal probes to investigate the liquid  vacuum interface as well as droplet surface excitations .",
    "microscopic calculations of @xmath1he droplets are scarce.@xcite the properties of @xmath1he droplets doped with some inert atoms and molecular impurities have been addressed within the finite range density functional ( frdf ) theory,@xcite that has proven to be a valuable alternative to monte carlo methods which are notoriously difficult to apply to fermi systems .",
    "indeed , a quite accurate description of the properties of inhomogeneous liquid @xmath2he at zero temperature ( @xmath3 ) has been obtained within df theory,@xcite and a similar approach has followed for @xmath1he ( see ref . and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the experiments we report have been performed in a helium droplet machine used earlier for lif and bd studies , and is described elsewhere.@xcite briefly , helium gas is expanded under supersonic conditions from a cold nozzle forming a beam of droplets traveling freely under high vacuum conditions .",
    "the droplets are doped downstream employing the pick - up technique : in a heated scattering cell , bulk sodium is evaporated in such a way that , on average , a single metal atom is carried by each droplet . since electronic excitation of alkali - doped helium droplets is eventually followed by desorption of the chromophore , bd spectra can be registered by a langmuir - taylor surface ionization detector.@xcite phase - sensitive detection with respect to the chopped laser or droplet beam was used .",
    "for that reason the bd signal ( cf .",
    "[ exp_spectra ] ) , i.e.  a decrease in intensity , is directly recorded as a positive yield . for these experiments ,",
    "a new droplet source was built to provide the necessary lower nozzle temperatures to condense @xmath1he droplets .",
    "he/@xmath2he nanodroplets .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the positions of the two fine structure components of the na gas - phase @xmath0 transition.,width=377 ]    for the spectroscopic measurements presented in the following , we have set the source pressure to 20bar and the nozzle temperature to 11k for @xmath1he , and to 15k for @xmath2he .",
    "these conditions are expected to result in comparable mean cluster sizes around 5000 atoms per droplet.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ exp_spectra ] the absorption spectrum of na atoms attached to @xmath1he nanodroplets is shown in comparison to na - doped @xmath2he droplets .",
    "the outcome of the spectrum of na attached to @xmath1he nanodroplets is very similar to the spectrum on @xmath2he droplets .",
    "the asymmetrically broadened line is almost unshifted with respect to the gas - phase absorption .",
    "this absence of a shift immediately confirms the surface location because atoms embedded in bulk superfluid helium are known to evolve large blue - shifts of the order of a couple of hundreds of wavenumbers and much more broadened absorption lines.@xcite a blue shift is a consequence of the repulsion of the helium environment against the spatially enlarged electronic distribution of the excited state ( `` bubble effect '' ) .",
    "the interaction towards the @xmath1he droplets appears to be slightly enhanced , evidenced by the small extra blue shift of the spectrum compared to the @xmath2he spectrum . in a simple picture",
    "this means that more helium atoms are contributing or , in other words , a more prominent `` dimple '' interacts with the chromophore .",
    "the upper halves of the spectra are almost identical , when shifting the @xmath1he spectrum by @xmath4@xmath5 to lower frequencies .     plane showing the stable state of an alkali atom ( cross ) on a he@xmath6 droplet .",
    "the 9 inner lines correspond to densities @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and the 3 outer lines to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 @xmath13 for @xmath1he , and 0.0218 @xmath13 for @xmath2he ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    frdf calculations at @xmath14 confirm the picture emerging from the measurements , i.e.  the surface location of na on @xmath1he nanodroplets causing a more pronounced `` dimple '' than in @xmath2he droplets .",
    "we have investigated the stable configurations of an alkali atom on both @xmath1he and @xmath2he clusters of different sizes .",
    "the frdf s used for @xmath1he and @xmath2he are described in refs . and .",
    "the large number of @xmath1he atoms we are considering allows to use the extended thomas - fermi approximation.@xcite the presence of the foreign impurity is modeled by a suitable potential obtained by folding the helium density with an alkali - he pair potential .",
    "we have used the potentials proposed by patil@xcite to describe the impurity - he interactions .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the equilibrium configuration for alkali atoms adsorbed onto he@xmath6 clusters .",
    "comparison with the stable state on the @xmath2he@xmath6 cluster shows that , in agreement with the experimental findings presented before , the `` dimple '' structure is more pronounced in the case of @xmath1he , and that the alkali impurity lies _ inside _ the surface region for @xmath1he and _ outside _ the surface region for @xmath2he ( the surface region is usually defined as that comprised between the radii at which @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the he saturation density@xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the lower surface tension of @xmath1he as compared to that of @xmath2he , which also makes the surface thickness of bulk liquid and droplets larger for @xmath1he than for @xmath2he.@xcite    the deformation of the surface upon alkali adsorption is characterized by the `` dimple '' depth , @xmath18 , defined as the difference between the position of the dividing surface at @xmath19 , with and without impurity , respectively.@xcite for @xmath1he we have found @xmath204.4 , @xmath214.1 , and @xmath214.3  , for na , k and rb , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath2he are @xmath202.3 , @xmath212.3 , and @xmath212.0  , respectively .",
    "solvation energies defined as @xmath22 have also been calculated and are shown in fig .",
    "the value @xmath23 k has been obtained within frdf theory for na adsorbed on the _ planar _ surface of @xmath2he ( ref . ) , which corresponds to the @xmath24 limit .",
    "a detailed discussion on solvation energies and akhe - exciplex formation on helium nanodroplets will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , we have obtained the shift between the @xmath1he and @xmath2he spectra in fig .",
    "[ exp_spectra ] within the frank - condon approximation , i.e. assuming that the `` dimple '' shape does not change during the na excitation .",
    "the shift is calculated within the model given in ref .",
    ", evaluating eq .",
    "6 therein , both for @xmath1he and @xmath2he .",
    "we have used the excited state a @xmath25 and b @xmath26 potentials of ref . because their na - he ground state potential is very similar to the patil potential we have used to obtain the equilibrium configurations . for @xmath27",
    ", we find that the @xmath1he spectrum is blue - shifted with respect to the @xmath2he one by 6.4@xmath5 , in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath4@xmath5 as extracted from fig .",
    "[ exp_spectra ] .",
    "our results thus show that alkali adsorption on @xmath1he droplets occurs in very much the same way as in the case of @xmath2he , i.e. , the adatom is located on the surface , though in a slightly more pronounced `` dimple '' .",
    "the similarities in the experimental spectra are certainly remarkable for two apparently very different fluids , one normal and the other superfluid , and clearly indicate that superfluidity does not play any substantial role in the processes described here ( we recall that while @xmath2he droplets , which are detected at an experimental @xmath3 of @xmath21 0.38 k , are superfluid , these containing only @xmath1he atoms , even though detected at a lower @xmath3 of @xmath21 0.15k , do not exhibit superfluidity@xcite ) .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the very fast time scale characterizing the na electronic excitation compared to that required by the he fluid to readjust .",
    "the excitation occurs in a `` frozen '' environment and the only significant difference between @xmath1he and @xmath2he is due to the different structure of the``dimple '' , which accounts for the small shift in their spectra observed in the experiments and found in our calculations as well .",
