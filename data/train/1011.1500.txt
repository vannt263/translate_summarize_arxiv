    "primordial inflation is the dominant paradigm in current cosmology since ( i ) it resolves the conceptual difficulties of the standard big bang model , and ( ii ) it predicts primordial perturbations with properties in excellent agreement with those that characterize the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . despite these successes , there is still no compelling particle physics model of inflation ; the key obstacle being the requirement of a sufficiently flat scalar potential , @xmath3 .",
    "even generic planck - suppressed corrections may yield unacceptably large contributions to the slow roll parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , thus spoiling inflation ( prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath6 , while @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass ) .",
    "one of the simplest solutions to this problem is to assume that the inflaton @xmath6 is a pseudo nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) @xcite-@xcite . in this case",
    "the inflaton enjoys a shift symmetry @xmath8 , which is broken either explicitly or by quantum effects . in the limit of exact symmetry , the @xmath6 direction is flat and thus dangerous corrections to @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    "are controlled by the smallness of the symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , pngbs like the axion are ubiquitous in particle physics : they arise whenever an approximate global symmetry is spontaneously broken and are plentiful in string compactifications .",
    "axion inflation is also phenomenologically desirable since the tensor - to - scalar ratio is typically large in such models .",
    "the first explicit example of axion inflation was the natural inflation model @xcite in which the shift symmetry is broken down to a discrete subgroup @xmath11 , resulting in a periodic potential @xmath12\\ ] ] with @xmath13 the axion decay constant .",
    "for such potential , agreement with observations requires @xmath14 , which may be problematic since it suggests a global symmetry broken above the quantum gravity scale , where effective field theory is presumably not valid .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 does not seem possible in string theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , several controlled realizations of axion inflation have been studied  including double - axion inflation @xcite , n - flation @xcite , axion monodromy @xcite and axion/4-form mixing @xcite  which have @xmath15 but nevertheless behave effectively as large field inflation models ( @xmath16 ) .    in axion inflation models , the inflaton couples to some gauge field as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the scale of this coupling is set by the axion decay constant , @xmath13 ; the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 is typically order unity but can be @xmath21 in multi - field @xcite or extra - dimensional models @xcite .",
    "it is natural to explore the implications of this generic interaction for observables . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that energy dissipation into gauge fields can slow the motion of @xmath6 , providing a novel new inflationary mechanism that operates at very strong coupling . here",
    ", we point out that even in the conventional slow - roll regime , the coupling @xmath22 can have significant impact .",
    "the motion of the inflaton amplifies the fluctuations of the gauge field , which in turn produce inflaton fluctuations via _ inverse decay _",
    "@xcite : @xmath23 . when @xmath24 , which is natural for realizations that admit an uv completion , we show that the inverse decay typically dominates over the usual vacuum fluctuations from inflation , and this has dramatic phenomenological consequences .",
    "our results are quite general : in the spirit of effective field theory , a coupling @xmath0 should be included whenever @xmath6 is pseudo - scalar @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in nongaussian effects in the cmb ( see the review @xcite for references ) .",
    "nongaussianity will be probed to unprecedented accuracy with the forthcoming planck data and may provide a valuable tool to discriminate between models .",
    "several constructions are known which can predict an observable signature ; however , in the minimal cases nongaussianity is small , and obtaining an observable level usually requires either fine - tuning or unconventional field theories .",
    "here we point out that the inverse decay contribution to @xmath1 is highly nongaussian in axion models ; observational bounds are easily saturated for @xmath13 not much smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the simplest and , perhaps , most natural models of inflation can lead to observable nongaussianity .",
    "we consider the theory @xmath26 where @xmath6 is the pngb inflaton , @xmath27 the field strength of the gauge field ( for simplicity , a @xmath28 gauge field is considered ; the extension to non - abelian groups is straightforward ) , and @xmath29 its dual .",
    "the potential @xmath3 may contain a periodic contribution of the form ( [ vnp ] ) due to non - perturbative effects and , perhaps , non - periodic contributions from other effects ( such as moduli stabilization or wrapped branes ) . in this section , we leave @xmath3 arbitrary , except to suppose that it is sufficiently flat to support @xmath30 @xmath31-foldings of inflation .",

    "working in coulomb gauge , we decompose @xmath33 into circular polarization modes obeying @xcite @xmath34 a_{\\pm}(\\tau , k ) = 0 , \\hspace{3mm}\\xi \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha \\dot{\\phi}}{2 f h}\\ ] ] where dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we observe that one of the polarizations of @xmath38 experiences a tachyonic instability for @xmath39 .",
    "the growth of fluctuations is described by @xcite @xmath40 in the interval @xmath41 of phase space which accounts for most of the power in the produced gauge field ( we take @xmath42 without loss of generality ) .",
    "this interval is nonvanishing only for @xmath43 , which we assume in the following .",
    "the production is uninteresting at smaller @xmath44 .",
    "the unstable growth of @xmath45 yields an important new source of cosmological fluctuations , @xmath1 .",
    "the perturbations of the inflaton are described by @xcite @xmath46 \\delta \\phi(t,{\\bf x } ) = \\frac{\\alpha}{f } f^{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde{f}_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where the source term is constructed from ( [ tac ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ inf_eom ] ) splits into two parts : the solution of the homogeneous equation and the particular solution which is due to the source .",

    "we computed the two - point @xmath49 and three - point @xmath50 correlation functions using the formalism of @xcite .",

    "the two terms in ( [ pwr ] ) are the power spectra of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts of ( [ hom+par ] ) , respectively .",
    "there is no `` mixed term '' since the two contributions ( [ hom+par ] ) are uncorrelated .",

    "the power spectrum is probed by cmb and large scale structure observations .",
    "it is found to be nearly scale invariant ( @xmath57 , the precise value depends on the data set assumed @xcite ) , and have amplitude @xmath58 @xcite ( the so - called cobe normalization ) . when inverse decay fluctuations are subdominant , we have the standard result @xmath59 ; however , at large @xmath44 the value of @xmath60 must be modified .",
    "the three - point correlation function encodes departures from gaussianity .",
    "nongaussian effects from inverse decays are maximal when all three modes have comparable wavelength ( the equilateral configuration ) .",
    "the magnitude of the three - point function is conventionally quantified using the parameter @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we find that : @xmath62 this result does not include the negligible contribution from @xmath63 and is accurate as long as @xmath64 . from eqs .",
    "( [ pwr ] ) and ( [ fnl ] ) we can see that @xmath65 at large @xmath44 .",
    "the current wmap bounds are @xmath66 ( @xmath67 cl ) , while the planck satellite , and planned missions , will constrain @xmath68 to @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the results ( [ pwr ] ) and ( [ fnl ] ) only depend on the two dimensionless combinations @xmath44 and @xmath70 , shown in figure  [ fig : contours ] .",
    "the solid red curve indicates the parameter values which reproduce the cobe normalization of the power spectrum . in the region",
    "below , and above the dashed black line the power spectrum is dominated by @xmath63 and by @xmath56 , respectively . this second regime is already ruled out by the current bound on @xmath68 .",
    "the results ( [ pwr ] ) and ( [ fnl ] ) have been obtained by disregarding two backreaction effects of the produced gauge quanta .",
    "such quanta are produced at the expense of the kinetic energy of @xmath6 , so that , if the instability is sufficiently strong , then it will affect the inflaton dynamics .",
    "the region of parameter space where this occurs is above the black solid line ( @xmath71 ) shown in figure  [ fig : contours ] .",
    "we have also disregarded the impact of the energy density of the produced quanta on the expansion rate , @xmath72 .",
    "this is justified provided @xmath73 .",
    "this constraint is not expressed in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath70 , so we have not included it in figure [ fig : contours ] .",
    "however , it can be studied on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the gauge quanta also source gravity waves ( gw ) .",
    "it is customary to normalize the power of gw to that of the density perturbations .",
    "proceeding analogously to the computation of the density perturbations , we find @xmath74\\ ] ] the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath75 , is an important quantity to discriminate between different inflationary models .",
    "the current observational limit is @xmath76 @xcite , and activity is underway to probe @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we now focus our attention on the power - law potential @xmath78 which subsumes many interesting scenarios",
    ". inflation proceeds at large field values @xmath16 and ends when @xmath79 . for this model , the values of @xmath72 , @xmath80 and @xmath54",
    "are uniquely determined by the number of e - foldings of observable inflation @xmath81 , according to the standard slow roll inflaton evolution ( @xmath82 ) . in the following , we fix @xmath83 , which is the typical value taken in large field models .",
    "once we do so , we are left with the two parameters @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . for any given value of @xmath84 , the mass scale @xmath85",
    "is uniquely determined by fixing the power spectrum ( [ pwr ] ) to the cobe value .",
    "we can then plot the other observational predictions as a function of @xmath84 only .",
    "we do so in figure  [ fig : predictions ] , where we take @xmath86 for illustration . in both cases ,",
    "backreaction effects can be neglected .",
    "figure [ fig : predictions ] shows that large nongaussianity is rather generic for large - field axion inflation .",
    "the current bound is saturated for decay constants @xmath87 , which is natural in a model that admits a uv completion .",
    "current limits on nongaussianity therefore provide an upper bound on the _ strongest _ couplings of the type @xmath22 between the inflaton and _ any _ gauge field .",
    "we see also that @xmath75 decreases at strong coupling .",
    "this modifies the usual predictions of large field inflation and implies , for example , that @xmath88 could be made compatible with observation , at the level of the @xmath89-point function . *",
    "natural inflation : * the original natural inflation model @xcite was based on the potential ( [ vnp ] ) . if we require @xmath90 , as suggested by recent data @xcite , then the model requires a large decay constant @xmath91 @xcite . in this regime inflation proceeds near the minimum @xmath92 and is indistinguishable from the model ( [ power_law ] ) with @xmath93 .",
    "large values of @xmath13 weaken the coupling of @xmath6 to @xmath94 , hence inverse decay is negligible unless @xmath95 , whereas we expect @xmath96 in the simplest ( single - axion ) scenario . on the other hand , @xmath97 may be problematic and it seems that a uv completion of axion inflation requires @xmath98 .",
    "we now turn our attention to such scenarios .",
    "* axion monodromy : * in @xcite an explicit , controlled realization of axion inflation was obtained from string theory .",
    "the potential has the form @xmath99 where the linear contribution arises because the shift symmetry is broken by wrapping an ns@xmath100-brane on an appropriate 2-cycle , and the periodic modulation is due to nonperturbative effects .",
    "the former typically dominates @xcite so we have the model ( [ power_law ] ) with @xmath101 , to first approximation .",
    "the decay constant is bounded @xcite as @xmath102 with @xmath103 the string coupling and @xmath104 the compactification volume in string units . from fig .",
    "[ fig : predictions ] we see that large nongaussianity is easily obtained for @xmath105 .",
    "periodic modulation of @xmath3 can also lead to resonant nongaussianity @xcite for @xmath106 and @xmath107 sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "* n - flation : * in @xcite it was noted that the collective motion of @xmath108 axions @xmath109 , each with its own broken shift symmetry , can support inflation when @xmath110 , via the assisted inflation mechanism @xcite .",
    "this scenario is quite natural in string theory , where generic compactifications may contain exponentially large numbers of axions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath111 we can expand the potential near the minimum to obtain @xmath112 .",
    "the dynamics of the collective field @xmath113 are well - described by a single field model of the form ( [ power_law ] ) with @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "sufficient inflation requires @xmath114 which can be achieved for sub - planckian @xmath109 provided @xmath115 is sufficiently large .    typically , the mass basis @xmath116 is not aligned with the interaction basis @xcite , so that all @xmath109 couple to a given gauge field as @xmath117 .",
    "the coupling of the collective field @xmath118 to @xmath94 is highly model - dependent but can be parametrized as @xmath119 , so that the result of fig .  [ fig : predictions ] apply for the effective coupling .",
    "a precise calculation depends on the mass rotation and the microphysics , but we expect that an observable signal is possible for reasonable parameters .    * double - axion inflation : * ref .",

    "one linear combination of the two axions becomes a flat direction of ( [ knp ] ) .",
    "this relation can be ascribed to a symmetry of the theory , and the curvature of the potential along this direction can be made controllably small if this symmetry is only slightly broken . in this case one obtains an effective large field inflaton , with a potential of the type ( [ vnp ] ) , and with an effective axion constant @xmath126 , even if all the @xmath127 are sub - planckian .",
    "therefore , this model can lead to large production of gauge fields and observable @xmath68 .      in summary",
