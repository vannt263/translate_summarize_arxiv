    "the lower values of @xmath3 are also found in the control sample - a cvd - grown graphene from pure @xmath1c precursor ( see the next section ) , and therefore can not be attributed to the dephasing from hyperfine fields from the @xmath0c nuclei .",

    "these two aspects : a need for a general 3d form of bloch equation and non - linear dependence of @xmath146 make the predictions of the spin signal very difficult .",
    "to tackle this problem we use a finite - element software package ( comsol multiphysics , version 4.3 ) which allows to define a set of partial differential equations ( pde ) and solve it for an user defined geometry .",
    "we use a two channel model @xcite for spin transport , in which we define spin - dependent chemical potential as a variable @xmath147 , where @xmath148 . in arbitrary external magnetic fields ,",
    "not necessary perpendicular to the graphene plane , the electron spins change their orientation , therefore we define the chemical potential in 3d spin space separately for each spin channels : @xmath149 .",
    "the up and down arrows refer to the spin orientation only at the point of injection and not at the distances further away from injector , where spin orientation undergoes precession .",
    "we emulate the spin dynamics separately for each spin channel , linking them only by spin relaxation . in this problem the charge and spin transport are coupled , therefore when solving the diffusion equation the conservation of generalized currents @xmath150 has to be satisfied .",
    "the conservation of charge current is given by @xmath151 .",
    "in non - magnet @xmath152 , while in ferromagnet @xmath153 , @xmath154 , where @xmath83 is a polarization of a ferromagnetic contact .",
    "the conservation of spin is derived from valet - fert equation with additional precession term @xmath155 , where the term @xmath156 includes external and nuclear magnetic field .",
    "the 3d comsol model includes full geometry of the device together with ferromagnetic contacts and the tunnel barriers of finite resistance .    to verify our model we choose gaas system and spin transport results of chan _ _ et al.__@xcite as a reference .",
    "we set the device geometry corresponding to the one reported ( meshed with tetrahedrons ) and set charge and spin transport coefficients from the values determined therein : @xmath157  =  -5.3  t , @xmath158  =  -5  mt , @xmath159  =  10  ns , @xmath160  =  5  @xmath7 m , @xmath161  @xmath7 m , gaas polarization @xmath162 , where @xmath163  mev , @xmath164  0.2 .",

    "this is directly related to the change in the vectorial configuration of the magnetic fields involved and was also confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "next we simulate the oblique hanle effect by setting an external field at oblique angle @xmath170  =  10@xmath171 , so @xmath172 . with an increase of @xmath108 a central hanle peak shifts to the positive field values , creating an asymmetric lineshape ,",

    "additionally , the maximum peak at @xmath173=0 splits into two , see inset in fig  [ fig : gaas_hanle_vs_idc ] .",
    "this complex lineshape is a result of subtle interplay between all the magnetic fields included in the problem .",
    "these features are less pronounced than the dips in the spin - valve signal and require much higher spin accumulation to be resolved .",
    "all the obtained features are in agreement with the experimental findings of chan _ _ et al.__@xcite , confirming the validity of our model .",
    "as motivated in the main text the correlation time between delocalized conducting electrons and nuclei is very short and requires times of the order @xmath174  s to build up dynamical nuclear polarization .",
    "for that reason we perform a spin - valve measurement in a reduced magnetic field range , such that only the detector contact switches its magnetization ( so called minor loop measurement ) .",
    "this way the injected polarizing current @xmath175a has always the same spin direction .",
    "the eventual formation of dephasing dips in @xmath127 around zero field is monitored as a function of time by performing continuous field sweeps .",

    "as a last check of the possible correlation between nuclear field and spin dephasing mechanisms we try to induce nuclear magnetic resonance in @xmath0c nuclei . upon the high frequency electromagnetic field , which energy matches the energy difference between the nuclear spin levels , we can induce transitions between these states , thus enhancing the randomization of the nuclear field .",

    "we set @xmath181=  0.22  t , which corresponds to a resonance frequency @xmath178  =  2.355  mhz .",
