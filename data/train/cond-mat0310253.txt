    "simple fluids are dominated by excluded volume effects , which , within lattice gas models , are accounted for by the single occupancy constraint , whereby each site on a lattice can be occupied by at most one molecule .",
    "effective interactions between macromolecules or self - assembled aggregates in complex fluids , on the other hand , can be `` soft '' , i.e.  lack an impenetrable core . a good example is the effective pair potential between the centres of mass ( cm ) of interacting polymer coils , obtained by taking statistical averages over monomer conformations for fixed distances @xmath0 between the cms @xcite .",
    "recent extensive simulations of self - avoiding walk polymers carried out over a wide range of concentrations show that the repulsive state - dependent effective cm pair potential is of roughly gaussian shape , of width governed by the polymer radius of gyration , and of maximum amplitude @xmath1 @xcite ; this behaviour reflects the fractal nature of polymers in good solvent , leading to a low entropic cost at full overlap .",
    "several other complex fluids have been shown to exhibit ultrasoft coarse - grained interactions , e.  g.  star polymers @xcite or effective particles considered within dissipative particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "the penetrability of the corresponding `` gaussian core '' ( gc ) model , @xmath2 , leads to interesting phase behaviour at low temperatures ( @xmath3 ) , @xcite , but under conditions relevant for polymer solutions ( @xmath4 ) , the model behaves like a `` mean field '' fluid @xcite .",
    "however binary gaussian core mixtures , characterised by different energy scales @xmath5 for the three types of pairs , lead to phase separation for moderate couplings @xcite .",
    "this demixing , which occurs for purely repulsive , penetrable interactions , is of a very different nature than the usual phase separation of incompatible fluids , which is generally driven by the long - range attractive intermolecular forces .    in this paper",
    "we examine the simplest lattice gas representation of penetrable particles , in an effort to gain further insight into this novel class of phase transitions .",
    "the penetrable nature of the effective interaction is reflected by allowing of each lattice site .",
    "the simplest version of the model involves only on - site interactions of particles of the two species , with different energy penalties for the different types of pairs .",
    "while a steepest descent estimate of the grand partition function predicts phase separation , it will be shown that a more accurate treatment reveals the spurious nature of this transition , as expected for an effectively zero - dimensional system .",
    "the addition of nearest neighbour interactions leads to a genuine demixing transition , similar to that predicted for continuous versions of soft core mixtures examined earlier within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",

    "the main task of this paper is to approximately evaluate the grand partition function as a function of the temperature @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and of the chemical potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the two species . using the standard rules of statistical mechanics",
    ", this will lead directly to the pressure @xmath21 and to the mean occupation numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and hence to the composition of the mixture .",
    "phase separation will be signalled by a discontinuous change of the mean occupation number for well - defined values of @xmath24 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we shall first consider the simplest version of the model which only involves on - site interactions ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) , before examining the case including nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "in the absence of couplings between particles on different sites , the grand partition function , with @xmath25 , factorises into @xmath7 identical single site functions @xmath26 : @xmath27^l    = \\xi_{\\text{site}}^l.\\ ] ] the single site partition sum is not tractable analytically . for sufficiently large chemical potentials , implying mean occupation numbers @xmath28 ,",
    "the latter may be treated as continuous variables , and the sums in eq .   replaced by integrals : @xmath29 the integrand is sharply peaked around the most probable occupation numbers @xmath30 . adopting the standard steepest descent method",

    "the location of the maximum follows from the extremum condition @xmath38 which provides the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath31 . inserting the expansion into the integrand in eq .  , and extending the integral to negative occupation numbers ( which is again justified provided @xmath40 ) , the resulting gaussian integral is easily evaluated and leads directly to the following equation of state : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the volume per site .    the virial pressure in eq .  ,",
    "derived on the basis of steepest descent , is thermodynamically inconsistent with the relation between chemical potentials and mean occupation numbers ( identical to their most probable values ) .",
    "if the latter is integrated , an expression for the pressure follows which coincides with eq .  , but without the logarithmic fluctuation term .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the rpa treatment of continuous penetrable ( e.g.  gaussian ) core mixtures , where the virial and compressibility routes lead to equations of state similar in structure to eq .   with ( virial ) and without ( compressibility ) the last term @xcite .",
    "the two equations of state become identical in the high density limit pointing to the asymptotic `` mean - field fluid '' nature of systems of penetrable particles .    in view of the above analogy",
    ", it is not surprising that the equation of state leads to phase separation between sites with different mean occupation numbers when @xmath43 .",
    "this predicted phase separation is obviously spurious , because of the effectively 0-dimensional nature of the model when restriction is made to on - site couplings .",
    "the above steepest descent treatment has two obvious shortcomings .",
    "the first deficiency is the replacement of the discrete sums in eq .   by an integral , as well as the extension of the lower bounds in the integral to @xmath44 ;",
    "these approximations are expected to break down for low mean occupation numbers @xmath45 , or equivalently for low chemical potentials @xmath46 .",
    "this deficiency can be easily removed by reverting from the integrals to discrete sums over an interval of values of @xmath31 in the vicinity of the most probable values @xmath31 , and retaining the continuous integrals outside this interval . in the one - component case ,",

    "is seen to yield surprisingly accurate results , even at relatively low densities ( @xmath54 ) , and only breaks down in the @xmath55 limit .",
    "a more fundamental shortcoming of the steepest descent method is that eq .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the steepest descent method includes only the contribution of the highest ( global ) maximum of the integrand to the partition function  .",

    "for high nearest neighbour interaction ( @xmath90 no longer being positive definite ) the fluctuation term diverges at @xmath91 .",
    "this instability indicates a transition of the ground state from the homogeneous phase to a microfluid phase where high and low occupation numbers alternate in a checkered fashion . to show that the microphase exists also for the one - component fluid ( for @xmath92 ) a canonical monte carlo simulation was run on a @xmath93 cubic lattice ( @xmath94 ) with the parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",

    "these are compared with data from a canonical monte carlo simulation in figure [ fig:5 ] for the phase point @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "the agreement is reasonable , although there are still fairly large statistical errors , a problem commonly encountered in direct calculations of @xmath113 ( as opposed to fourier transforming @xmath114 ) .",
    "the error bars on the simulation results ( not shown ) are rather large .    in the calculations above we neglected all contributions from configurations in the partition sum other than the ( presumed ) ground state , where all occupation numbers are the same .",

    ", one can numerically follow the local maxima of the boltzmann factor . due to the high symmetry , many local minima stay degenerate even at finite nearest neighbour interaction .",

    "the remaining excited energy states depending on @xmath119 are shown in the same figure .",
    "the increasing gap between the ground state and the excited states is clearly seen .    for larger lattices",
    "the explicit enumeration of all local minima is no longer feasible because of their large number .",
    "we therefore resort to a simple metropolis algorithm employed in numerical optimization problems @xcite . instead of systematically searching the @xmath67 dimensional occupation number state , we generate trial configurations randomly from the previously found local minimum , analogous to the random particle displacements used in monte carlo simulations .",
    "after each random step in the space of occupation numbers a local minimization of the energy is performed .",
    "the random step is then accepted or rejected based on the energy difference of the two local minima .",
    "effectively the very rugged energy landscape is therefore replaced with a locally constant function , thereby eliminating the numerical problems one usually encounters when solving global optimization problems . in figure [ fig:7 ] the resulting local energy minima",
    "are shown together with the ( presumed ) homogeneous ground state .",
    "all the minima lie on or slightly above the presumed ground state , thereby supporting our hypothesis that the ground state is the homogeneous state . in figure [ fig:8 ] the difference between the local minima and the ground state energy",
    "is plotted .",
    "even though some local minima are not found during the search , one can clearly see a trend of an increasing gap between the ground state and the first excited state when the nearest neighbour interaction increases . for a nearest neighour interaction that equals",
    "10 percent of the on - site interaction one finds a gap of approximately @xmath120 .",
    "even stronger nearest neighbour interaction should further widen the gap , leading to a higher accuracy of the ground state approximation .",
    "to test the validity of the ground state approximation , gibbs ensemble monte carlo simulations @xcite of the model have been performed on a @xmath121 lattice . after an equilibration time of 1  000  000 steps two lattices were allowed to exchange particles and random moves within each lattice were attempted according to the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "the simulations were restricted to symmetric interactions with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . since in these systems",
    "the equation of state must be invariant with respect to relabelling of the species ( or equivalently mirroring the concentration @xmath124 ) , volume changes of the lattice were not necessary , i.  e.  the two lattice systems were automatically under equal pressure .",
    "two typical phase diagrams are shown in figure [ fig:9 ] and [ fig:10 ] .",
    "it is seen that the ground state approximation predicts the correct shape of the phase diagram , albeit underestimates the densities of the coexistencing phases .",
    "the discrepancy becomes larger for larger interaction energies , when the contributions of the excited states are no longer negligible , and the ground state approximation becomes less accurate .",
    "the lattice model introduced in this paper , which allows for multiple occupancy of lattice sites by one or two species , with positive energy penalties , and includes repulsive nearest neighbour interactions , leads to intersting phase behaviour . in the one - component version ,",
    "a steepest descent analysis allowing for gaussian fluctuations , predicts microphase separation onto two interpenetrating sub - lattices with different mean occupation numbers ( `` checkered '' phase ) when the ratio @xmath125 of nearest - neighbour to on - site couplings exceeds a threshold .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the two - component extension of the model leads to a macroscopic demixing transition into phases of different concentrations of the two species .",
    "the steepest descent analysis predicts such a phase separation , even in the absence of nearest - neighbour interactions , but this is shown to be due to the expected break - down of the approximation . in the presence of nearest - neighbour interactions , the steepest - descent analysis corresponds to a `` ground state '' approximation . a numerical search of local minima of the energy surface points to a significant gap ( @xmath126 ) between the homogeneous `` ground - state '' and the first `` excited states '' , thus providing support for the validity of the approximation .",
    "the predicted phase diagrams agree reasonably well with the results of gibbs ensemble mc simulations .",
    "the present model is directly inspired by the continuous `` gaussian core '' model , first introduced by stillinger @xcite , and which has recently been shown to provide an adequate coarse - grained description of interacting , interpenetrating polymer coils @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lattice model , considered here , appears to have some unorthodox features .",
    "contrary to more familiar lattice gas models , it is not isomorphous to an ising spin model .",
    "hence it is not yet clear whether its critical behaviour belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "the binary version is expected to exhibit both the microphase separation found here in the one - component case , and the macroscopic phase separation anologuous to that of the continuous binary gaussian core model @xcite .",
    "the interplay between these two phase transitions should lead to interesting and novel behaviour , which will be explored in future work ."
