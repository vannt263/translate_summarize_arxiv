    "b - lymphocytes play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system .",
    "they express y - shaped receptor molecules , antibodies , on their surface .",
    "antibodies have very specific binding sites ( _ idiotopes _ ) which determine their _",
    "idiotype_. all receptors of a given b - cell have the same idiotype .",
    "b - cells are stimulated to proliferate if their receptors are cross - linked by structures which are complementary to the idiotopes , e.g. by foreign antigen .",
    "stimulated b - cells thus survive whereas unstimulated b - cells die , this process is called clonal selection @xcite .",
    "after a few generations , stimulated b - cells differentiate to plasma cells which secrete soluble antibody molecules of the same idiotype , which may bind to complementary sites on antigen and mark them for further processing .",
    "b - lymphocytes of different idiotype are continuously produced in the bone marrow in a remarkable diversity .",
    "the variety of the potential idiotype repertoire , created by somatic reshuffling of gene segments and mutations @xcite , was combinatorially estimated @xcite to exceed most likely @xmath0 .",
    "complementary structures may be found on antigen but could also be situated on other antibodies of complementary idiotype .",
    "b - lymphocytes can stimulate each other and , thus , they form a functional network , the _ idiotypic network _ @xcite .",
    "jerne s concept of the idiotypic network explains in a natural way the diversity of the expressed idiotype repertoire and the autonomous dynamics of an immune system not exposed to foreign antigen .",
    "it provides a mechanism of immunological memory .",
    "imagine that an antigen @xmath1 is recognized by an antibody @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the clone of @xmath2 expands and possibly meets another clone of complementary idiotype @xmath3 .",
    "both mutually stimulate each other and they persist even after @xmath1 has disappeared .",
    "@xmath3 is structurally similar to @xmath1 and can be considered as internal image of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the network is thought to control autoreactive clones .",
    "all these issues are beyond the concept of clonal selection .",
    "the network paradigm got an immediate enthusiastic response and idiotypic interactions were considered as the major regulating mechanism of the immune system .",
    "however , the rapid progress of molecular immunology , difficulties in the direct experimental verification , and the discovery of other regulating mechanisms let the interest of experimental immunologists decay . yet , for system biologists the network paradigm always remained attractive .",
    "several aspects of the original concept were revised in due course .",
    "most notably , varela and coutinho @xcite suggested second generation networks with an architecture comprising a strongly connected central part with autonomous dynamics and a sparsely connected peripheral part for localized memory and adaptive immune response . in a sense , they reconcile both paradigms of idiotypic networks and clonal selection . a readable history of immunological paradigms can be found in @xcite .",
    "reviews with focus on idiotypic networks are @xcite with an emphasis on modeling approaches and more recently @xcite with emphasis on new immunological and clinical developments .",
    "today the main activities are in clinical research .",
    "idiotypic interactions are the base of all therapies with monoclonal antibodies @xcite .",
    "new experimental techniques make large - scale studies of the idiotypic repertoire feasible @xcite which are necessary to infer the networks architecture .",
    "in this paper we consider a minimalistic model of the idiotypic network , which was first formulated and investigated in @xcite . in this model",
    "a node represents lymphocytes and antibodies of a given idiotype .",
    "lymphocytes of complementary idiotype can stimulate each other .",
    "the corresponding nodes are connected by links .",
    "idiotypes are represented by bitstrings of length @xmath4 , @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "ideally , @xmath4 is chosen such that @xmath7 is the size of the potential repertoire .",
    "the nodes of the network are labeled by these bitstrings .",
    "two nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are linked if their bitstrings are complementary allowing for up to @xmath10 mismatches , i.e. their hamming distance is @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding undirected graph is the base graph @xmath12 .",
    "each node has the same number of neighbors , @xmath13 .",
    "it represents the potential idiotypic repertoire with all possible interactions .",
    "not all idiotypes are expressed in the real network . in our minimalistic model",
    "we only account whether an idiotype is present or not , correspondingly the node is occupied , @xmath14 , or empty , @xmath15 .",
    "the subgraph of @xmath12 induced by the occupied nodes represents the expressed idiotypic network at a given time .",
    "we describe the temporal evolution in discrete time .",
    "the influx of new idiotypes from the bone marrow is modeled by occupying empty nodes with probability @xmath16 .",
    "of new idiotypes was added in each influx step .",
    "here we prefer to occupy empty nodes with a given probability @xmath16 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the transition from a microcanonical to a canonical approach in statistical physics . ] for survival a b - lymphocyte needs stimulation by complementary structures .",
    "the dose - response curve is log - bell shaped , cf .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein .",
    "if there are too many complementary structures , crosslinking becomes less likely due to steric hindrance , the stimulus is reduced . in our model an occupied node survives if the number of occupied neighbors is between two thresholds , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the rules of parallel update are    1 .",
    "occupy empty nodes with probability @xmath16 + 2 .",
    "count the number of occupied neighbors @xmath19 of node @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath19 is outside the window @xmath20\\,$ ] , set the node @xmath8 empty + 3 .",
    "iterate . +    driven by the random influx of new idiotypes the network evolves towards a quasi - stationary state of nontrivial , functional architecture in which groups of nodes can be identified according to their statistical properties .",
    "crucial for that is besides the random occupation of empty nodes , that occupied nodes are emptied if linked with too few or too many occupied nodes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the model in its scientific context in other disciplines and its relation to other models of idiotypic networks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulationresults ] we provide simulation results .",
    "we sketch a typical random evolution of the system to make the reader familiar with the systems behavior . considering global and local network characteristics the existence of groups of nodes which share statistical properties @xcite",
    "is confirmed and more details are revealed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : patternmodules ] we describe certain regularities in the bitstrings of nodes which belong to the same group .",
    "the observed patterns can be constructed from pattern modules .",
    "the construction principle is explained first for the simplest pattern and generalized afterwards .",
    "these findings allow to calculate the number of groups , the group sizes , and the linking between groups . a new observable , the center of mass ,",
    "is introduced that proves very useful in real - time pattern identification . in sec .",
    "[ sec : specificpatterns ] we apply this concept considering specific patterns observed in simulations , among them a dynamic pattern with core groups , peripheral groups , stable holes , and singletons that resembles in some aspects the biological network @xcite . in the appendix",
    "we calculate the scaling of the relative size of these groups for systems of biological size .",
    "the topic falls into several scientific disciplines .",
    "it is natural to place our investigations in the context of network theory .",
    "network theory has applications in a plethora of different , multidisciplinary fields @xcite and has received great attention in the community of statistical physicists in the last decade .    a major body of research deals with growing networks , where new nodes are attached to the existing nodes randomly , or depending on properties of the existing nodes . in this context deletion of nodes",
    "is only considered to study the resilience of the network against random or targeted attacks @xcite . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "natural networks however do not grow without limit but stay finite and evolve towards a functional architecture .",
    "there are several modes to enable evolution : ( i )  adding nodes but keeping the growth balanced by deletion @xcite or merging of nodes @xcite .",
    "( ii )  keeping the nodes unaffected but add , delete , or reorganize the links @xcite .",
    "( iii )  addition and deletion of both nodes and links @xcite .",
    "again , this can be done randomly or depending on the properties of the nodes and its neighbors .",
    "generic observables to characterize networks include the degree distribution , centrality , betweenness , cliquishness , modularity , clustering coefficients , and diameter .",
    "for instance , growing networks using preferential attachment have a power law degree distribution like many real world networks . however , the characteristic exponent of preferential attachment networks is larger than the one found in natural networks .",
    "this was a major motivation to study evolving networks .    in many natural networks nodes",
    "have individual properties which control their potential linking .",
    "clearly , in our case this is the idiotype .",
    "also protein networks , transcription networks and generally signaling networks belong to this class .",
    "nodes may have an internal state which can change depending on their neighborhood in the network , or on external influences .",
    "this dynamics has a typical time scale that is shorter than the time scale for evolution of the network s architecture .",
    "the interplay of these processes came into the focus of research only in the last few years .",
    "for a recent review and a status report see @xcite .",
    "our model is a very early example where this interplay is studied @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we describe the building principles of the architecture .",
    "our network model is a boolean network @xcite , since each node can be only in one of two states , empty or occupied .",
    "the nodes are updated in consecutive time steps depending on its own and its neighborhood occupation .",
    "the model is also a _ cellular automaton _",
    ", for a comprehensive monograph see @xcite .",
    "more precisely , since the update depends only on the sum of the neighbor states and the state of the node itself , it is a _ totalistic _ cellular automaton .",
    "cellular automata naturally involve unoccupied nodes . in",
    "our model unoccupied nodes , holes , play an important role .",
    "we distinguish holes that could be occupied from stable holes which can not be occupied due to overstimulation . a simple network picture disregards nodes which are not occupied .",
    "a famous example of a totalistic two - dimensional deterministic cellular automaton is conway s game of life @xcite .",
    "both , the survival of an occupied cell and the occupation of an empty cell , are governed by window rules .",
    "many interesting patterns , depending on the initial conditions static or dynamic , have been described in detail and classified .",
    "the game of life was transfered to a variety of lattices , e.g. to three dimensional cubic lattices @xcite , to triangular , pentagonal and hexagonal tesselations , to penrose tilings @xcite and to small world geometry @xcite .",
    "larger than life @xcite increases the radius of the neighborhood . also , a probabilistic version on a 2d square lattice has been proposed , where stochastic deviations from the deterministic update are permitted @xcite .",
    "the mean occupation of cells , a global order parameter , undergoes a sharp phase transition for increasing strength of stochasticity . on the occasion of the 40th anniversary appeared a comprehensive collection of recent results on the game of life and its descendants @xcite .",
    "our model can be considered as a further version of the game of life on a high dimensional graph , where empty nodes are randomly occupied , while the survival of occupied nodes is governed by a deterministic window rule .",
    "starting from an empty graph we observe an evolution toward a complex , highly organized architecture .",
    "the model can also be categorized as a stochastic , non - linear dynamical system .",
    "there exists a variety of models for b - cell networks .",
    "references @xcite give comprehensive surveys of modelling approaches .",
    "for instance , stewart and varela @xcite proposed a model , which also has a random influx and a window update rule to simulate the internal dynamics and a zero / one clone population .",
    "however , while we consider a discrete @xmath4-dimensional hypercubic shape space , in their model the complementary idiotypes live on different sheets of a 2d continuous shape space .",
    "a summary of results obtained in models with continuous shape space is given by bersini @xcite .",
    "several aspects of modeling in continuous and discrete shape space are discussed in @xcite .    an early network model inspired by spin glass physics",
    "was proposed by parisi @xcite to describe immunological memory .",
    "the interaction between idiotypes in the model of barra and collaborators @xcite is also taken from spin glass physics .",
    "their model describes a given number of idiotype populations each with a constant number of lymphocytes",
    ". each cell can be in a firing or quiescent state .",
    "the strength of the ferromagnetic coupling between the idiotypes ( also encoded by bitstrings ) models the affinity , which is related to the complementarity of the bitstrings .",
    "barra and agliari @xcite compute the degree distribution , the type and number of loops , and consider the scaling behavior .",
    "they describe primary and secondary immune responses and understand low and high dose tolerance as a network phenomenon . in our model",
    "the log - bell - shaped response is integrated as a b - cell property @xcite .",
    "essential for our approach is a random influx of new cells and a selection mechanism .",
    "hence , we can describe the evolution of the network towards a functional architecture .",
    "a model which distinguishes between antibody molecules and lymphocytes with a dynamics including an influx similar to ours is proposed by ribeiro et al .",
    "they compare the dynamics on given architectures of random and scale - free networks .",
    "immsim , invented by celada and seiden @xcite , is also a modified cellular automaton .",
    "it incorporates many immunologic agents , including antigen presenting cells , b - cells , t - cells , antigens , antibodies and cytokines .",
    "it describes both humoral and cellular responses .",
    "idiotypes are also characterized by bitstrings .",
    "the vast amount of interacting agents increases drastically the number of parameters .",
    "the model is intended to be as realistic as possible and to provide experimental and practical immunologists with a tool to test hypotheses _ in silico_. our approach is in a sense complementary .",
    "we aim at an understanding of the principles governing the autonomous evolution toward a functional architecture .",
    "therefore we investigate a minimalistic model with a small number of parameters , which nevertheless exhibits essential features of the biological network .",
    "the concept of idiotypic networks inspired applications in computer sciences , e.g. artificial immune systems for the detection of intrusion , of spam or viruses @xcite .",
    "in this section we report on simulations on the base graph @xmath21 , which consists of @xmath22 nodes , each of which has @xmath23 links to other nodes .",
    "the window rule parameters are @xmath24=[1,10]\\,$ ] .",
    "the lower threshold is biologically motivated , a node needs at least one occupied neighbor to survive .",
    "the upper threshold is chosen to enable a non - trivial , dynamic pattern of complex architecture .",
    "as discussed below in more detail , higher @xmath18 would allow a broader variety of static patterns . however , the concept developed in this paper still applies .",
    "the simulations start with an empty base graph .",
    "the influx @xmath16 varies from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "this covers the range in which we find interesting patterns , above @xmath27 there is only trivial random behavior .",
    "we start the simulations with an empty base graph occupying nodes with probability @xmath16 . in the first time step",
    "only those nodes survive which have at least one occupied neighbor ( having more than @xmath18 occupied neighbors is unlikely in the beginning ) .",
    "the surviving nodes represent seeds the neighbors of which will survive if occupied .",
    "hence , we observe a rapid growth of a giant cluster until more and more nodes have more than @xmath18 occupied neighbors . exceeding the upper threshold",
    "deletes a node .",
    "thus , the giant cluster decays and many stable holes are created , i.e. nodes with the number of occupied neighbors above the upper threshold @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] shows a time series for the evolution to a stationary state where the number of stable holes increases up to its stationary value .    the empty base graph is a highly symmetric object . due to the random influx",
    "the symmetry is broken and the system falls into a network configuration of lower symmetry .",
    "the typical result of the evolution is a quasi - stationary pattern of mutually dependent occupied nodes and stable holes .",
    "properly situated occupied nodes create stable holes and in return stable holes in the neighborhood of an occupied node may prevent its overstimulation .    in the generic case for a given @xmath16 a certain pattern type is found most frequently .",
    "occasionally , depending on the history of the driving process , also other patterns occur .",
    "once established they all can live for a long time .",

    "this becomes immediately clear considering the following unlikely but possible event . for any choice of @xmath28",
    "the occupation of nodes by the influx can be such that the application of the window rule leads to an empty base graph .",
    "after this extinction catastrophe the further realization of the driving process , the influx , determines to which pattern the system evolves . for any",
    "@xmath28 an infinite trajectory contains partial trajectories leading to any possible pattern . in practice ,",
    "in our simulations we have never seen such an extinction catastrophe but only quasi - stationary patterns usually living for a long time . for increasing system size",
    "such catastrophes become less likely . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "we expect a breaking of ergodicity",
    ".    in our finite system there can be transitions between different patterns on a route without extinction catastrophe but via the formation of an intermediate , unstable giant cluster , for more details see @xcite .",
    "modeling biological systems we should keep in mind that they are finite and have a finite life expectation .",
    "the quasi - stationary state could persist for times longer than the life span of the individual but transitions between different states can not be excluded .",
