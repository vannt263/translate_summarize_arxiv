    "during recent years , the experimental observation of a large number of so - called @xmath9 states has inspired tremendous effort to unravel their nature beyond the conventional quark model  @xcite . in @xmath10 ,",
    "the belle collaboration first reported the observation of @xmath2 in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath12  @xcite which was subsequently confirmed by the babar collaboration  @xcite in the same channel .",
    "it was also discovered in proton - proton / antiproton collisions by the d0  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , and lhcb collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 is the first , and perhaps the most renowned exotic candidate ; however , its nature is still ambiguous due to its peculiar properties .",
    "first , only an upper bound of the total width has been measured experimentally : @xmath13 mev  @xcite , which is tiny compared to typical hadronic widths .",
    "second , the mass is located close to the @xmath14 threshold , @xmath15  mev  @xcite , which leads to speculation that the @xmath2 is presumably a meson - meson molecular state  @xcite .",
    "many studies on the production and decay of the @xmath2 have been carried out in order to understand its nature .",
    "the discrimination of a compact multiquark configuration and a loosely bound hadronic molecule configuration is one important aspect . from this point , it is also valuable to look for the counterpart in the bottom sector , denoted as @xmath1 following the notation in ref .",
    "@xcite , as states related by heavy quark symmetry may have universal behaviors .",
    "since the @xmath1 is very heavy and its quantum numbers @xmath16 , it is less likely discovered at the current electron - positron collision facilities , though the super kekb may provide an opportunity in @xmath17 radiative decays  @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath1 at the lhc and the tevatron  @xcite and other exotic states at hadron colliders  @xcite have been extensively investigated .",
    "on one hand , it is shown that the production rates at the lhc and the tevatron are sizeable  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the search for @xmath1 also depends on reconstructing the @xmath1 , which motivates us to study the @xmath1 decays . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the radiative decays of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , with @xmath1 being a candidate for the meson - meson molecular state , and found that the partial widths into @xmath20 are about @xmath21 kev . since this meson is expected to be far below threshold and the mass difference between neutral and charged @xmath22 mesons is very small , the isospin - violating decay mode , for instance @xmath23 , is highly suppressed , and this may explain the escape of @xmath1 in the recent cms search  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the isospin - conserved decays @xmath24 , on which we will focus this paper , will be of high priority .    to calculate @xmath24 , we investigate the intermediate meson - loop ( iml ) contributions .",
    "as is well known , iml transitions have been one of the important nonperturbative transition mechanisms in many processes , and their impact on the heavy quarkonium transitions has been noticed for a long time  @xcite .",
    "recently , this mechanism has been applied to study @xmath22 decays  @xcite , the production and decays of exotic states  @xcite and a global agreement with experimental data were obtained .",
    "thus , this may be an effective approach to deal with the @xmath1 hidden bottomonium decays .",

    "the heavy quark spin structure is mandated to be @xmath30  @xcite . however , in the tetraquark picture of @xmath1 , the total spin @xmath27 can be either @xmath31 or @xmath21 . as a result ,",
    "the dominant hidden bottomonium decay channel is @xmath32 in the molecule picture of @xmath1 , while the hidden bottomonium decay channels of @xmath1 can be those channels with @xmath33 or @xmath21 final bottomonium . from this point of view",
    ", it seems that a molecule @xmath1 may have a bigger branching ratio of @xmath34 than a tetraquark @xmath1 .    generally speaking",
    ", we should include all the possible intermediate meson loops in the calculation .",
    "in reality , the breakdown of the local quark - hadron duality allows us to pick up the leading contributions as a reasonable approximation  @xcite . since we consider the isoscalar @xmath1 as an @xmath35-wave molecular state with @xmath36 given by the superposition of @xmath37 and @xmath38 hadronic configurations as @xmath39 meson loops here .",
    "the coupling of @xmath1 to the bottomed meson pair is based on the following effective lagrangian , @xmath40 + h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the coupling constant . for the @xmath1 below the @xmath35-wave @xmath42 threshold , the effective coupling of this state",

    ", one can obtain @xmath61 mev .",

    "@xcite , the mass was predicted to be @xmath89  mev , which corresponds to a binding energy @xmath90  mev .",
    "these studies can provide a range for the binding energy , and in the following we will choose a few illustrative values : @xmath91 mev .    in table  [ tab : results-1 ] , we list the predicted partial widths by choosing the dipole form factor and three values for the cutoff parameter @xmath92 . from this table , we can see that the widths for the @xmath34 are about tens of kevs .",
    "the particle data group gives an upper bound for the total width of @xmath2 to be @xmath93 mev  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the similarity between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the full width for @xmath1 should be narrow .",
    "hence , our results would indicate a sizeable branching fraction for @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthonexb ] , we present the partial widths for the @xmath0 in terms of the @xmath83 with the dipole form factors @xmath94 ( solid lines ) , @xmath81 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath82 ( dotted lines ) , respectively . as shown in this figure , there is no cusp structure in the curve .",
    "this is because the mass of @xmath1 lies below the intermediate @xmath42 threshold .",
    "the uncertainties caused by the form factors indicate our limited knowledge on the applicability of the effective lagrangian .",
    "however , fortunately , the dependence of the partial widths are not drastically sensitive , which indicates a reasonable cutoff of the ultraviolet contributions by the empirical form factors .",
    "both the coupling strength of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling - xb ] ) and the threshold effects influence the binding energy dependence of the partial width . on the one hand , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling - xb ] ) , the coupling strength of @xmath1 increases with the binding energy @xmath83 . on the other hand",
    ", the threshold effects decrease with @xmath83 .",
    "both the coupling strength of @xmath1 and the threshold effects change quickly in the small @xmath83 region and slowly in the large @xmath83 region . as a result",
    ", the behavior of the partial width is relatively sensitive at small @xmath83 , while it becomes smooth at large @xmath83 .    as mentioned above , the coupling constant @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling - xb ] ) is based on the assumption of a shallow bound state , so our determination of this coupling has uncertainties which are mainly due to the nonperturbative pion exchange . for the interaction between two heavy hadrons forming a bound state , one can formulate an effective field theory ( eft ) description  @xcite of hadronic molecules , which is analogous to that of the eft formulation of the nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "there are two main simplifications for heavy hadrons : the first one is that heavy quark symmetry severely constrains the low - energy interactions among them  @xcite ; the second is that pion exchanges are usually perturbative and only produce small effects  @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the isoscalar in the bottom sector where the pions might be nonperturbative due to the large masses of the bottom mesons  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the studies indicate that the relative errors of @xmath95 are about 20% for the isoscalar @xmath1 .",
    "so even if we consider the impact of this effect , the estimated order of the magnitude for the branching ratio @xmath24 may also be sizeable and can be measured in experiments .    in the heavy quark symmetry limit",
    ", one may correlate the transition matrix element of the @xmath0 with that of @xmath96 . generally speaking , with the experimental measurements of the masses of @xmath2 and the experimental lower limit branching ratio of @xmath97  @xcite",
    ", one can first use the heavy quark symmetry to determine the cutoff parameter value @xmath92 and then give a round estimation of the possible experimental measurements on @xmath34 .",
    "however , we should also notice that the phase space dependence behavior of the partial widths may be quite different for these two decay channels . for the process @xmath97",
    ", the allowed phase space is very small , while the phase space is large enough for the process @xmath34 .",
    "maybe systematic experimental and theoretical studies on these decay processes can test this point .    in the case of hidden bottomonium decays of @xmath1 ( such as @xmath34 and @xmath98 ) with @xmath1 being an @xmath35-wave @xmath99 molecule candidate , since the heavy quarks in the @xmath99 meson pair have to recombine to form the final bottomonium , the transition from the @xmath99 meson pair into the @xmath100 plus @xmath71 ( or photon ) occurs at a distance much smaller than both the size of the @xmath1 as a hadronic molecule and the range of forces between the @xmath22 and @xmath101 mesons . as a consequence ,",
    "these processes are not sensitive to the @xmath99 wave function at long distances which is governed by the binding energy , but rather they are determined by the short distance part of the @xmath1 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative decays @xmath102 , and especially their ratio @xmath103 , are not sensitive to the long - range structure of the @xmath1 , and thus they can not be used to rule out the picture that the @xmath1 is dominantly a hadronic molecule . in order to further investigate the structure of @xmath1 , it is necessary to explore other decay channels , and the radiative decay @xmath104 might give the best hint about the molecular nature of @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath104 , one of the constituent hadrons ( @xmath22 ) is in the final state and the rest of the final particles are products of the decay of the other constituent hadron ( @xmath105 ) of the @xmath1 molecule . in these processes , the relative distance between the @xmath3 pair can be as large as allowed by the size of the @xmath1 , since the final state is produced by the decay of @xmath105 instead of the rescattering transition .",
    "so this process is sensitive to the long - distance part of the wave function of a hadronic molecule and can be used to probe the long structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental observation of @xmath1 , hunting for hidden bottomonium decays ( @xmath6 , @xmath106 ) and @xmath104 can help us understand the structure of @xmath1 .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the isospin - conserved hidden bottomonium decay @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is taken to be the counterpart of @xmath2 in the bottomonium sector as a meson - meson molecule candidate .",
    "since the mass of this state may be far below the @xmath3 threshold , the isospin - violating decay channel @xmath23 would be highly suppressed and stimulate the importance of the isospin - conserved decay channel @xmath0 .",
    "we explore the rescattering mechanism with the effective lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the calculated partial width of @xmath0 is about tens of kevs .",
    "taking into account the fact that the total width of @xmath1 may be smaller than a few mev like @xmath2 , the calculated branching ratios may reach to orders of @xmath5 .",
    "this study of hidden bottomonium decay along with the previous work on production rates in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite and radiative decays of @xmath1  @xcite have indicated a promising prospect to find the @xmath1 at hadron colliders , in particular , the lhc , and we suggest that our experimental colleagues perform an analysis .",
    "also , the associated studies of hidden bottomonium decays @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 may help us investigate the structure of @xmath1 systematically .",

    "<S> in this work , we study the isospin conserved hidden bottomonium decay of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is taken to be the counterpart of the famous @xmath2 in the bottomonium sector as a candidate for the meson - meson molecule . </S>",
    "<S> since it is likely that the @xmath1 is below the @xmath3 threshold and the mass difference between the neutral and charged bottom meson is small compared to the binding energy of the @xmath1 , the isospin violating decay mode @xmath4 would be greatly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we use the effective lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry to explore the rescattering mechanism of @xmath0 and calculate the partial widths . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the partial width for the @xmath0 is about tens of kevs . taking into account the fact that the total width of @xmath1 may be smaller than a few mev like @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the calculated branching ratios may reach to orders of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these hidden bottomonium decay modes are of great importance in the experimental search for the @xmath1 particularly at the hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> also , the associated studies of hidden bottomonium decays @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 may help us investigate the structure of @xmath1 deeply . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of @xmath1 will provide us with further insight into the spectroscopy of exotic states and is helpful to probe the structure of the states connected by the heavy quark symmetry . </S>"
