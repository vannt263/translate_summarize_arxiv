    "the dynamics of granular material under shear stresses plays a fundamental role in many natural phenomena and technological applications .",
    "when the shear stress exceeds certain threshold , granular material undergoes a transition from a solid state to a fluidized state ( yield ) . the physical mechanism and properties of this transition",
    "are still not completely understood . in many important situations ,",
    "the granular material remains in a multi - phase state , when part of it is fluidized while another part is solid .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a significant progress had been achieved by large - scale molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and by continuum theory @xcite .",
    "the current continuum theory of dense near - surface flows was pioneered by bouchaud , cates , ravi prakash and edwards ( bcre)@xcite and subsequently developed by de gennes , boutreux and and raphal @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the granular system is spatially separated into two phases , static and rolling .",
    "the interaction between the phases is implemented through certain conversion rates .",
    "this model describes certain features of thin near - surface granular flows including avalanches .",
    "however , due to its intrinsic assumptions , it only works when the granular material is well separated in a thin surface flow and an immobile bulk . in many practically important situations ,",
    "this distinction between `` liquid '' and `` solid '' phases is more subtle and itself is controlled by the dynamics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a unifying description of such partially fluidized granular flows and apply this theory to several problems of granular dynamics@xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of our approach is borrowed from the landau theory of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "we assume that the shear stresses in a partially fluidized granular matter are composed of two parts : the dynamic part proportional to the shear strain rate , and the strain - independent ( or `` static '' ) part .",
    "the relative magnitude of the static shear stress is controlled by the order parameter ( op ) which varies from 0 in the `` liquid '' phase to 1 in the `` solid '' phase .",
    "a possibility of describing a granular flow as a multi - phase system undergoing a phase transition , has been proposed by de gennes@xcite without further elaboration . unlike ordinary matter",
    ", the phase transition in granular matter is controlled not by the temperature , but the dynamics stresses themselves . in particular , the mohr - coloumb yield failure condition@xcite is equivalent to a critical melting temperature of a solid .",
    "the op can be related to the local entropy ( and possibly density ) @xcite of the granular material .",
    "op dynamics is then coupled to the hydrodynamic equation for the granular flow .",
    "we apply this theory to several cases of granular flows of considerable interest .",
    "first , we will focus on gravity driven free - surface granular flows which typically occur in shallow chutes , sandpiles , and rotating drums .",
    "the most famous form of such flows is an avalanche , and our theory yields a rather detailed description of the avalanche dynamics .",
    "then we apply our theory to granular couette flows induced in the bulk by a moving boundary .",
    "our model captures important phenomenology observed in these systems experimentally @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we describe general formulation of the partially fluidized granular flows . in sec .",
    "iii we focus on free surface flow problem on incline plane ( chute flow ) . in this section",
    "we consider stability properties of stationary solutions , avalanches in shallow chutes , transitions from triangular to uphill avalanches , and comparison with experimental results . in sec .",
    "[ deep_layers ] we study flow in deep layers .",
    "we illustrate application of this theory for two - dimensional rotating drum . we show that our model exhibit avalanche flow at low rotation rates and transition to steady flow for higher rotation rates . in sec .",
    "v we extend our approach for shear granular flow and discuss connection with dry friction phenomena in granular systems . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss various implications of our results .",
    "we base the continuum description of granular flows on the momentum conservation equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the components of velocity , @xmath2 is the density of material ( we set @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is acceleration of gravity , and @xmath5 denotes material derivative , @xmath6 denotes components of stress tensor .",
    "since the relative density fluctuations are small , we assume that the velocity obeys the incompressibility condition @xmath7 . here",
    "we emphasize that changes in density in fact are very important , since the onset of flow in granular materials itself is related to dilatancy , or small decrease in density .",
    "however , the relative changes of density for dense flows are typically very small ( below few percent ) , and therefore the compressibility effects for hydrodynamics of granular flows are negligibly small .",
    "still , these small variations in density can substantially affect transport coefficients and constitutive relations .",
    "in fact , our order parameter equation describes sensitive response of granular media to small changes in local ordering , and , consequently , small changes in density",
    ".    momentum conservation equation ( [ elastic ] ) has to be augmented by the appropriate boundary conditions ( bc ) . as usual , on solid walls we require no - slip conditions @xmath8 , and on free surfaces , the kinematic boundary condition is assumed , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the displacement of the free surface , and @xmath11 is the normal velocity to the surface .    the main difficulties in describing granular flows center around the constitutive relationships for stresses @xmath6 .",
    "these relationships differ drastically for flowing and static configurations of granular matter . for static regimes ,",
    "the shear stresses are determined by the applied forces , whereas in flows the shear stresses are proportional to shear strain rates .",
    "the transition from one regime to another is controlled by so - called yield criteria , among which the most popular is mohr - coloumb criterion relating shear and normal stresses .",
    "the goal of our paper is to unify the description of these different regimes of granular dynamics within a single theory .",
    "the central conjecture of our theory is that in partially fluidized flows , some of the grains are involved in plastic motion , while others maintain prolonged static contacts with their neighbors .",
    "accordingly , we write the stress tensor as a sum of the hydrodynamic part proportional to the flow strain rate @xmath12 , and the strain - independent part , @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 . we assume that diagonal elements of the tensor @xmath15 coincide with the corresponding components of the `` true '' static stress tensor @xmath16 for the immobile grain configuration in the same geometry , and the shear stresses are reduced by the value of the order parameter @xmath17 characterizing the `` phase state '' of granular matter .",
    "thus , we write the stress tensor in the form @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the viscosity coefficient , @xmath20 is kronecker symbol . in a static state ,",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath8 , whereas in a fully fluidized state @xmath23 , and the shear stresses are simply proportional to the strain rates as in ordinary fluids .    to complete the set of governing equations , we need to introduce constitutive relations for components of the static shear stress tensor @xmath6 , as well as an equation for the order parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the issue of constitutive relations in static granular configurations is rather complex and not completely understood@xcite .",
    "it appears that in many cases , the constitutive relations are determined by the construction history@xcite .",
    "recent studies elucidated the fundamental role of the force chains networks in formation of the shear stress tensor @xcite .",
    "we will assume that for any given problem , the corresponding static constitutive relations have been specified .",
    "since in dense granular flows the energy is rapidly dissipated due to inelastic collisions , we apply pure dissipative dynamics for the order parameter @xmath17 , which can be derived from the `` free - energy '' type functional @xmath24 : @xmath25 we adopt the standard landau form for @xmath26 , which includes a `` local potential energy '' and the diffusive spatial coupling .",
    "the potential energy density @xmath27 should have extrema at @xmath23 and @xmath21 corresponding to uniform solid and liquid phases . according to the mohr - coulomb yield criterion for non - cohesive grains@xcite or its generalization @xcite , the static equilibrium failure and transition to flow",
    "is controlled by the value of the non - dimensional ratio @xmath28 , where the maximum is sought over all possible orthogonal directions @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the bulk of the granular material .",
    "we simply use this ratio as a parameter in the potential energy for the op @xmath17 . without loss of generality , we write the equation for @xmath17 : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are characteristic time and length correspondingly .",
    "one can expect that the length @xmath33 is of the order of the grain size and the time @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is typical time between collisions in dense granular flow .",
    "further , according to observations , there are two angles which characterize the fluidization transition in the bulk granular material , an internal friction angle @xmath36 such that if @xmath37 the static equilibrium is unstable , and the `` dynamic repose angle '' @xmath38 such that at @xmath39 , the `` dynamic '' phase @xmath23 , is unstable",
    ". values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend on microscopic properties of the granular material , and they do not coincide in general .",
    "typically there is a range in which both static and dynamics phases co - exist ( this is related to the so - called bagnold hysteresis@xcite ) .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath42 which satisfies these constraints , is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 here we use a square of @xmath45 to avoid non - analytical behavior at @xmath46 .",
    "rescaling @xmath47 and @xmath48 leads to @xmath49 this equation completes the general formulation of the continuum theory for partially fluidized granular flows . in an infinite system with fixed stress parameter @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "both static ( @xmath21 ) and dynamic ( @xmath23 ) phases are linearly stable , and eq.([op - eq1a ] ) possesses a moving front solution which `` connects '' these phases .",
    "the speed of the front in the direction of @xmath23 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "at @xmath53 both phases co - exist . for @xmath54 , only `` solid''phase survives , and at @xmath55 , only liquid phase survives .",
    "the dynamics of partially fluidized granular flows becomes much more interesting in confined systems with fixed or free boundaries . in the following sections we consider several such problems of particular interest",
    "let us now specialize our theory to the description of free - surface chute flows .",
    "we consider a layer of dry cohesionless grains on a sticky surface tilted by angle @xmath56 to the horizon .",
    "we introduce a cartesian coordinate frame aligned with the tilted layer ( see figure [ setup_chute ] ) . in case of a stationary shear flow , the force balance of eq.([elastic ] ) yields the following conditions : @xmath57 where the subscripts after commas mean partial derivatives .",
    "the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) in the absence of lateral stresses @xmath58 is given by @xmath59    thus , in a stationary flow there is a simple relation between shear and normal stresses , @xmath60 independent on the flow profile . in a static equilibrium",
    ", the force balance also gives @xmath61 .",
    "since by assumption @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 . in a flowing regime ,",
    "the total stresses are composed of the static contribution in the viscous strain - related terms .",
    "according to our conjecture , the same relation holds between the static parts of the stress in the flowing regime . in this section",
    ", we will consider non - stationary process of avalanche flow , but we will assume that this simple constitutive relation between shear and normal stresses is maintained in this regime as well , and deviations from the stationary stress distribution are small .",
    "for the chute flow geometry , the value of parameter @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ delta00 ] ) can be easily specified . in this case , the most `` unstable '' yield direction is parallel to the inclined plane , so we can simply write @xmath64 . on the free surface we impose the no - flux condition for the order parameter , @xmath65 , and at the bottom @xmath66 we set @xmath21 ( a granular medium is in a solid phase near the no - slip surface ) .",

[ nonstat ] for details ) , and the material derivative @xmath84 in eq.([op - eq1a ] ) can be replaced by @xmath85 , @xmath86 however , for fast flows this term may become important , see discussion below in sec .",

    "they found a significant deviation in the shear flow profile from the simple exponential profile observed in earlier 2d experiments@xcite and successfully reproduced by our theory ( see the previous section ) .",
    "@xcite gives strong evidence for the gaussian ( @xmath359 behavior of the velocity profile near the outer wall .",
    "as we show below , this feature can be attributed to essentially three - dimensional geometry of the experiment in contrast to that of refs .",
    "it follows directly from the fact that the normal stress ( pressure ) in sufficiently long vertical cylinders filled with dry granular materials , saturates and does not depend on height of the cylinder ( as in the celebrated jansen picture of silo , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , consider the distribution of stresses in infinite layer of grains in contact with 2 vertical walls ( gravity is directed along the @xmath154-axis ) at the points @xmath360 and @xmath361 , see fig .",
    "[ setup_shear ] . from the projection of force on @xmath154 axis",
    "we obtain the condition @xmath362 since we assume that the diagonal component @xmath330 does not depend on depth , i.e. @xmath154-coordinate , and there is no @xmath196-dependence of stresses , we obtain that the weight is supported by the tangential stress @xmath363 .",
    "due to shearing we will also have tangential stress @xmath364 , as in the two - dimensional case ( with notational difference that @xmath70 now indicates the direction normal to the walls ) .",
    "now , we need to relate the tangential stresses to the control parameter @xmath74 using the mohr - coulomb condition in three dimensions . it is well known @xcite that the tangential and normal stresses @xmath365 and @xmath366 lie within the shaded area limited by the mohr s circles built upon the major , intermediate , and minor principal stress values @xmath367 .",
    "( see fig.[mohr_circle ] ) . as it is clear from fig.[mohr_circle ] , the maximum value of the ratio @xmath368 occurs at the tangential point @xmath181 at which @xmath369 the major and minor principal stresses are determined as eigenvalues of the shear stress tensor @xmath6 .",
    "the control parameter @xmath74 is related to @xmath45 via eq.([delta00 ] ) , so in this case @xmath370/(\\phi_1",

    "\\label{mcc4}\\ ] ]    for simplicity we assume that all diagonal components of the stress tensor are equal ( like in fluid ) : @xmath371 . this assumption makes the calculation much simpler , although qualitatively similar behavior is expected in general case . here",
    "@xmath372 has the meaning of pressure on the bottom of the cell and from dimension consideration one concludes that @xmath373 , where @xmath374 is a constant which depends on surface wall roughness etc . @xcite .",
    "one obtains the eigenvalues @xmath375 thus , one derives @xmath376 \\label{mcc}\\ ] ] here , as before , @xmath377 characterizes shear rate and is proportional to @xmath327 .",
    "therefore , the control parameter @xmath74 in 3d has an explicit @xmath70-dependence .",
    "in contrast , in 2d geometry we had simply @xmath378 .",
    "let us now evaluate the decay rate of the order parameter . linearizing eq .",
    "( [ op - eq1 ] ) near @xmath21 we obtain @xmath379 we focus on the solution near the wall @xmath360 . if @xmath380 , we can apply wkb approximation and seek the solution in the from @xmath381 into eq .",

    "let us point out that , to the first order , the coefficient in front of @xmath389 does not depend on the shear rate in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "we developed a continuum theory of partially fluidized granular flows .",
    "this theory is based on a combination of the mass and momentum conservation laws with an equation for the order parameter describing the transition from the static to flowing regime . in this sense",
    ", our theory goes beyond the hydrodynamical description of dense granular flows , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the order parameter which is a crucial variable in our theory , can be interpreted as a portion of the static contacts among particles in a small volume within the granular system .",
    "this characteristic is difficult to measure in physical experiments , but can be extracted from molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "phenomenological parameters in our model can be obtained from comparison with molecular dynamics simulations and experiments . in a certain limit",
    "our model can be reduced to two coupled equations for the depth of fluidized layer and local angle , which resemble bcre model , however differ from it in detail . in particular , our model has intrinsic hysteretic behavior absent in bcre model .",
    "it may appear surprising that our theory has the characteristic length of the order of the grain size @xmath165 .",
    "usually , the hydrodynamic description is valid on the scale much larger then @xmath165 .",
    "we believe that in case of dense granular flows , the continuum ( but non - hydrodynamic ) description is possible because in the flow regime the granular system `` samples '' all possible states in the configuration space , thus providing `` self - averaging '' . moreover , our model exhibits `` critical slowdown '' for @xmath390 . in this case",
    "the decay length ( or , pursuing the analogy with equilibrium critical phenomena , the `` coherence length '' ) @xmath391 diverges at the critical point .",
    "thus , rigorous derivation of order parameter equation can be anticipated in the vicinity of point of spontaneous fluidization @xmath138 .",
    "our order - parameter model captures many important aspects of the phenomenology of chute flows observed in recent experiments @xcite , including the structure of the stability diagram , triangular shape of downhill avalanches at small inclination angles and balloon shape of uphill avalanches for larger angles .",
    "it provides an adequate description of granular flows in a 2d rotating drum and in couette geometry .",
    "in particular , we found the experimentally observed features such as periodic oscillations of the shear stress and flow velocity at low rotation rates and transition to steady flow at higher rates .",
    "for shear cell experiment our model gives rise to the exponential velocity profile in two dimension and gaussian correction to the profile in three dimensions .",
    "we believe that our model can be applicable to other granular flows and can be generalized to binary mixtures of granular materials , wet and cohesive granular materials and granular flows with additional vibration . another challenging project is to derive the order parameter description from some sort of `` microscopic '' theory of granular flow , in analogy to the theory of superconductivity , where the order parameter equation was first proposed phenomenologically by ginzburg and landau @xcite , and later derived from the microscopic theory of superconductivity by gorkov and eliashberg @xcite .",
