    "in 1970 , vitaly efimov found a remarkable effect in the quantum spectrum of three particles  @xcite .",
    "he considered particles interacting through short - range attractive interactions that are nearly resonant . by _ short range _",
    ", one means interactions decaying faster than @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interparticle distance , and by _ nearly resonant _",
    ", one means attractive interactions that can almost or just barely support a weakly two - body bound state .",
    "the fact that , in quantum mechanics , an attractive interaction may be too weak to bind two particles is due the quantum fluctuations of the kinetic energy ( also known as the zero - point energy ) that competes with the attractive interaction . when the interaction is just strong enough to cancel the repulsive effect of the kinetic energy , the interaction is said to be resonant because two particles scattering at low energy are very close to binding during their collision : they spend a long time together ( they `` resonate '' ) before separating , which is characterised in scattering theory by an @xmath4-wave scattering length that is much larger than the range of the interactions .    under these conditions",
    ", vitaly efimov found that an effective long - range three - body attraction arises , and this attraction may support an infinite family of three - body bound states ( called efimov states or efimov trimers ) , in which the three particles are bound at larger and larger distances , beyond the range of the interactions . the efimov effect , as it became known , is striking in several aspects :    [ [ induced - long - range - interaction ] ] induced long - range interaction + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    even though the interactions are short - ranged",
    ", the three particles feel a long - range three - body attraction .",
    "this seemingly counter - intuitive situation can be explained by the fact that an effective interaction is mediated between two particles by the third particle moving back and forth between the two .",
    "it is thus possible for the three particles to feel their influence at distances much larger than the range of interactions , typically up to distances on the order of the scattering length .",

    "the three - body system is scale invariant .",
    "quantisation in this attractive potential gives an infinite series of bound states , the efimov trimers , whose properties such as size and energy are related to each others by a fixed scale transformation .",
    "the energy spectrum , for instance , forms a geometric series with an accumulation at the zero energy threshold , corresponding to infinitely weakly bound states .",
    "this situation is referred to as the `` discrete scale invariance '' of efimov states .",
    "efimov states thus look like a infinite family of matryoshka , the russian wooden dolls that can be nested inside each other .",
    "this image was originally given to describe renormalisation - group limit cycles  @xcite , which constitute a possibility among the general classification of renormalisation - group limits , originally proposed by kenneth g. wilson  @xcite .",
    "this possibility , which exhibits discrete scale invariance , is indeed realised in systems exhibiting the efimov effect  @xcite two - body interactions @xcite such as an electron scattering off an excited hydrogen atom . a more general discussion on discrete scale invariance is given in ref .",

    "this possibility of binding @xmath5 particles , while the @xmath6 subsystems are unbound is called `` borromean '' binding and use the term  brunnian for larger @xmath5 . ] .",
    "this denomination derives from the ancient symbol of intricated circles called ",
    "borromean rings , which have been used , among others , by the borromeo family in their coat of arms .",
    "borromean rings are arranged in such a way that they can not be separated , although cutting one of them sets the others free .",
    "they therefore constitute a classical example of borromean binding . in this case",
    ", the binding is due to their specific topology . in the case of quantum particles , however , borromean binding is possible even if the interparticle interaction is isotropic and does not enjoy such topological properties . although it is counterintuitive from a classical point of view , it may be understood by considering that the number of degrees of freedom providing a zero - point kinetic energy scales like @xmath5 whereas the number of pairwise interactions scales like @xmath7 , making the interactions win for sufficiently large @xmath5 .",
    "efimov trimers are an example of this phenomenon for @xmath8 .    more difficult to interpret is the fact that when the interaction is strong enough to support a two - body bound state , further increasing the interaction reduces the binding of the three - body bound state with respect to that of the two - body bound state .",
    "+ in recent years , it has been realised that the efimov effect gives rise to a broad class of phenomena that have been referred to as _",
    "efimov physics_. consequences and extensions of the efimov effect have indeed been found in systems of various kinds of particles , from three to many particles , with various kinds of interactions and in various mixtures of dimensions .",
    "the denomination `` efimov physics '' is however not clearly defined and somewhat subjective .",
    "even the notion of what constitutes an efimov state has been debated and considerably extended by some authors - see section  [ subsec : what - is - an - efimov - state ] . in the strictest sense , `` efimov physics '' designates physics that is a direct consequence of the occurence of the efimov effect .",
    "more generally speaking , one may say that a system exhibits efimov ( or efimov - like ) physics when a three - or - more - body attraction emerges from short - range interactions and possibly exhibits some kind of discrete scale invariance .",
    "the purpose of this review is to cover the recent theoretical and experimental advances in efimov physics , taken in its broadest sense .",
    "efimov physics is not only remarkable for its distinctive properties , it is also part of what is often referred to as the _ universality _ of low - energy physics .",
    "when a physical system with short - range interaction has a sufficiently low energy , its wave function is so delocalised that many microscopic details of the interactions become irrelevant , and most of its properties can be effectively described by a few parameters .",
    "such physics is universal as it can be applied to many different systems , regardless of their microscopic details .",
    "efimov physics is an example of such a situation , as it involves states in which the particles are on average at larger separations than the range of their interactions .",
    "for instance the discrete scale invariance of efimov states is a universal feature that depends only on a few general properties such as the particles masses and quantum statistics . as a result of this universality",
    ", efimov physics applies to virtually any field of quantum physics , be it atomic and molecular physics  @xcite , nuclear physics  @xcite , condensed matter  @xcite or even high - energy physics  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , thanks to the formal connection between quantum theory and statistical physics , it may also apply to the thermal equilibrium of classical systems , such as three - stranded dna  @xcite .",
    "the universality of efimov physics does not mean that it occurs in any system .",
    "it means that any system meeting the conditions for its appearance exhibits the same universal features .",
    "these conditions turn out to be quite restrictive , which is why it has taken around forty years since the original theoretical prediction of the efimov effect to obtain convincing experimental confirmations .",
    "generally speaking , the efimov effect requires resonant short - range interactions .",
    "such interactions are rare , because they require a bound or virtual state to exist accidentally just below the scattering threshold of two particles .",
    "this situation turns out to be common in nuclear physics , but most nuclear particles obey fermi statistics , and the pauli exclusion between fermions overcomes the efimov attraction in most cases , preventing the efimov effect from occurring . on the other hand , bosonic particles or excitations",
    "are common in various fields of physics , but their interaction is rarely resonant .",
    "nevertheless , there are now a significant number of physical systems where efimov physics has been observed or is expected to be observed . in particular , with the advent of controllable feshbach resonances in ultra - cold atomic gases it has become possible to fulfill at will the conditions for the occurence of efimov physics , and study it extensively .",
    "since there have been many theoretical developments in efimov physics recently , this review is organised from the theoretical point of view in terms of physical situations leading to efimov or efimov - like physics .",
    "for each situation , the current state of experimental observation in different fields of physics is presented .",
    "although this choice of presentation requires the reader to read different sections to know about the experimental achievements in a particular field , it should give a comprehensive overview of what has , and what has not yet , been observed in efimov physics .",
    "the sections are relatively independent , so that the reader can jump directly to the situation of their interest . as for the readers who desire to grasp the bare essentials of the efimov effect",
    ", we have included a concise derivation of efimov theory in section  [ subsec : efimov - theory ] and discussed the main features of efimov states in section  [ subsec : what - is - an - efimov - state ] .",
    "in addition , we give in the following section a short history of the development of efimov physics underlining the landmarks contributions .",
    "history of efimov physics from the original theoretical prediction by vitaly efimov to the latest experimental observations , along with the number of related publications ( source : web of knowledge ) . ]    in 1970 , vitaly efimov was working as a junior researcher at the ioffe institute in leningrad , where he had completed his doctoral thesis four years earlier . following the seminal work of llewellyn h. thomas in 1935  @xcite and later works by skorniakov and ter - martirosian  @xcite , he was interested in the three - body problem in quantum mechanics to describe nuclear systems such as the triton ( the nucleus of tritium , made of one proton and two neutrons ) .",
    "thomas had shown that three particles with a symmetric wave function , unlike two particles , can be bound with arbitrarily large binding energy for sufficiently small range of the interparticle attractive force .",
    "this finding , referred to as the `` thomas collapse '' or `` fall to the centre '' seemed somewhat peculiar , but allowed thomas to estimate a lower bound for the range of nuclear forces from the measured energy of tritium , before it was confirmed by neutron - proton scattering experiments .    using the hyper - spherical coordinates , efimov found that when two of the particles can nearly bind , the three particles actually admit an infinite series of bound states of ever - increasing sizes , instead of just one as previously anticipated .",
    "this was due to an effective three - body attractive force , which gave a simple interpretation for the thomas collapse .",
    "he published his result in both the soviet literature  @xcite and western journals  @xcite where it became known as the `` efimov effect '' .",
    "the first publication in english did not provide the derivation and the effect was thus met with skepticism .",
    "however , it prompted some theorists to look into the problem and soon after , the validity of efimov s result was confirmed both analytically and numerically by r. d. amado and j. v. noble  @xcite . for a long time , however , the efimov effect was regarded by many as a theoretical peculiarity of the formal three - body problem that would have little to virtually no observable consequences on real physical systems . on the other hand",
    ", some people took the effect seriously and tried to find physical systems where it could be observed .",
    "vitaly efimov proposed in his original papers that the efimov effect could describe nuclear systems such as the triton and the famous hoyle state of carbon-12 .",
    "subsequently , it was suggested that the efimov effect may be revealed in some hypernuclei by t. k. lim in 1986  @xcite , and in halo nuclei by dmitri v. fedorov , aksel s. jensen , and karsten riisager in 1994  @xcite .",
    "the proposed nuclear systems indeed feature resonant two - body subsystems , which is a requirement for the efimov effect to occur .",
    "the closer to resonance the two - body subsystems are , the larger the number of three - body bound states .",
    "however , having more than one three - body bound state requires a very close tuning near the resonance , something that happens only accidentally in nature . as a result ,",
    "the proposed nuclear systems allow only one three - body bound state to exist , and do not reveal the infinity of other states predicted by the efimov theory closer to resonance . moreover , it is difficult to show that such a single three - body bound state originates from the efimov effect for two reasons .",
    "first , efimov s theory relies on an unknown three - body parameter to describe the three - body states , and is thus not quite predictive for the properties of a single three - body state , whereas it makes definite and universal predictions ( independent of the three - body parameter ) for the relative properties of two three - body states .",
    "second , the first three - body state is the smallest of the efimov series and is significantly affected by the details of the interparticle forces , to the point that it is debatable to call it efimov state . because of these ambiguities , and despite the experimental observations of the proposed nuclear systems , it has been difficult to prove or disprove that they are indeed efimov states .    to obtain better experimental evidence of the efimov effect",
    ", researchers turned to other kinds of particles for which the two - body resonance condition could be more closely fulfilled .",
    "seven years after efimov s theory , t. k. lim already pointed out the particular case of helium-4 atoms @xcite , whose interatomic interaction is close enough to resonance to admit two three - body bound states , as was checked subsequently by many few - body theorists .",
    "this prompted a decade - long experimental search for these two helium-4 trimer states by the group of jan peter toennies in gttingen , by analysing diffracted beams of helium-4 clusters  @xcite .",
    "while the ground - state trimer could be observed , the excited trimer state , which is regarded as a true efimov trimer and an evidence of the efimov effect , could not be observed .",
    "the breakthrough that established efimov physics came from the field of ultra - cold atoms . in the 1990s , it was predicted  @xcite and demonstrated experimentally  @xcite that the interactions between atoms could be controlled and brought to resonance by applying a magnetic field .",
    "this led to the proposal by brett d. esry , chris h. greene , and james p. burke jr  @xcite to observe the signatures of efimov states in such systems .",
    "such experimental signature of a three - body state near the two - body resonance of cesium-133 atoms was obtained in 2002 in the group of hanns - christoph ngerl and rudolf grimm in innsbruck , and after careful analysis reported in 2006  @xcite . although it revealed only one trimer , as in the nuclear systems or the previous experiments on helium , its efimovian nature appeared more convincing due to its borromean nature ( the trimer exists in a region where two - body subsystems are known to be unbound ) .",
    "this landmark experiment opened the way for a systematic investigation of efimov physics , because the interaction could now be controlled .",
    "this led to many similar experimental results from various laboratories around the world using other species of ultra - cold atoms ( in particular during the year 2009 ) as well as an intense theoretical activity to understand and explore various aspects of efimov physics in ultra - cold atoms .",
    "in the same year , universal four - body bound states tied to efimov states were evidenced in the cesium experiment in innsbruck by francesca ferlaino and co - workers  @xcite , just after being predicted by theorists  @xcite .",
    "the year 2009 culminated with the itamp workshop in rome entitled ",
    "efimov 2009 , where the wealth of new experimental and theoretical results was presented .    with the accumulation of experimental results in ultra - cold atoms",
    ", the theoretically unknown three - body parameter of the efimov theory could be obtained from experimental measurements for many different efimov states . in particular , it could be compared for different two - body resonances in the lithium-7 experiments by the group of lev khaykovich at bar - ilan university , and in the cesium experiments by the group of innsbruck  @xcite . to everyone",
    "s surprise , the three - body parameter was found to be nearly the same for all the resonances of a given atomic species .",
    "it even appeared to be universally correlated to the van der waals of the atoms , while it was thought to depend on many other microscopic details .",
    "this so - called  van der waals universality of the three - body parameter was later explained by theoretical works  @xcite , which showed that a sudden deformation of the trimer configuration prevents the three atoms from reaching separations smaller than the van der waals length , making the trimers insensitive to more microscopic features of the interatomic interaction .    while different measurements of three - body recombination and atom - dimer relaxation provided several experimental points in the three - body spectrum confirming the `` scenario'' obtained by vitaly efimov , the most striking aspect of this scenario , namely the discrete scale invariance leading to the geometric series of three - body bound states was not confirmed clearly since the experiments did not reveal consecutive three - body bound state .",
    "observing consecutive efimov states is an experimental challenge since each new state is by definition much larger in size with a much weaker binding energy .",
    "this endeavour was ultimately successful in 2014 , when the experimenters in innsbruck managed to observe a second efimov state of cesium atoms by pushing the limits of their experiment  @xcite , while the groups of cheng chin at the university of chicago  @xcite and matthias weidemller at the university of heidelberg  @xcite independently observed up to three efimov states of two cesium and one lithium atoms , whose energy levels were predicted to be closer to each other due to the large mass imbalance between these two atomic species .",
    "the same year , outside the ultra - cold atom community , the group of reinhard drner in frankfurt could finally observe the long - sought second trimer of helium-4 by the coulomb explosion imaging technique , a result published the following year @xcite .",
    "not only this brought further experimental confirmation of the efimov effect , it also provided the first spatial imaging of an efimov state .",
    "one may say that the year 2014 concluded a 44-year - long search for a full confirmation of the efimov effect .",
    "the history of this search is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : history - of - efimov ] where landmark contributions are indicated .",
    "the simplest situation for which efimov physics occurs corresponds to three identical bosons interacting via resonant short - range interactions . in section [ subsec : efimov - theory ] , we briefly present the corresponding theory originally proposed by vitaly efimov and its extensions for finite - range interactions . in the following sections , we review the experimental observations and prospects for observations of bosonic efimov states in nuclear , atomic , and condensed matter systems .",
    "we consider identical bosonic particles of mass @xmath9 , with no internal degree of freedom , interacting via short - range two - body ( and possibly three - body ) interactions . here , _",
    "short - range _ interactions means that the interaction potentials decay faster than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the separation between two particles .",
    "in this situation , there exists a separation @xmath10 , called the range of the interaction , beyond which the relative motion of two particles is almost free .",
    "it is in this asymptotically free region where the particles energy is purely kinetic that the efimov effect takes its roots , and that is why it is universal .",
    "although the relative motion of two particles is free in this region , each angular partial wave of the wave function @xmath11 describing the two - body relative motion has a phase shift @xmath12 with respect to the non - interacting wave function , as a result of the particles interacting at shorter separation .",
    "namely , in the partial - wave expansion of @xmath11 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the legendre polynomials , the partial wave component @xmath15 has the form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relative wave number between the two particles . in the absence of interaction , the phase shift @xmath18 ( no scattering occurs ) . on the opposite ,",
    "the strongest dephasing the interaction can induce is @xmath19 ( modulo @xmath20 ) , in which case the interaction is said to be _ resonant _ in that partial wave .",
    "efimov physics arises when the two - body interaction is near - resonant in the @xmath4-wave partial wave ( @xmath21 ) , which means that the phase shift @xmath22 of the @xmath4 wave is close to @xmath23 ( modulo @xmath20 ) .",

    "moreover , the phase shift can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 defines the _ _ scattering length__. therefore , for the two - body interaction to be resonant at low energy , the scattering length @xmath26 has to be much larger than @xmath10 : @xmath27 in particular , the limit @xmath28 is sometimes called the _ unitary limit _ or _",
    "unitarity _ , because in this limit the factor @xmath29 in the expression of the scattering cross section @xmath30 , approaches its maximal value @xmath31 .",
    "this maximum of the scattering cross section is the consequence of a fundamental property of quantum mechanics , the unitarity of the s - matrix .",
    "it can be reached precisely for resonant interactions .    near unitarity",
    ", the scattering length @xmath26 is the only parameter that controls the physics of two particles at low energy , either positive or negative : it determines the cross section for scattering states ( positive energy ) , and the binding energy of a weakly bound state below the break - up threshold ( negative energy ) .",
    "this bound state , also called _ dimer _ , exists only for a positive scattering length and its binding energy is close to @xmath32 where @xmath9 is the mass of the particles and @xmath33 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "the resonance of the interaction is therefore related to the appearance of the two - body bound state from below the scattering threshold exactly at the unitary limit @xmath34 .",

    "before we address the observations of efimov states , we have to ask ourselves what is an efimov state , and what constitutes an experimental evidence of such a state .",
    "the answer to these questions varies somewhat from one person to the other .",
    "the major issue is whether the ground - state trimer , which is the most likely to exist and most easily observable , should be included or not in the series of efimov states .",
    "let us review some proposed definitions of efimov states based on their energy spectrum .    1",
    ".   in the strictest sense , efimov states are evidence of the efimov effect , i.e. an accumulation point in the three - body spectrum at zero energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efimovplot ] . in this sense",
    ", one can not evidence a single efimov state , one needs to exhibit several ( at least two ) of these states and show that they follow the predicted discrete scale invariant pattern . in this definition ,",
    "the observation of the ground - state trimer is not an evidence of an efimov state .",
    "2 .   in another definition ,",
    "one may allow a single state to qualify as an efimov state , if it can be shown that its variation with scattering length follows qualitatively the universal curve obtained in the zero - range theory and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efimovplot ] , sometimes referred to as the `` efimov scenario '' .",
    "namely , the trimer has to appear from the three - body threshold at some negative scattering length , and disappear in ( or approach closely ) the particle+dimer threshold at some positive scattering length .",
    "the ground - state trimer often remains far below the particle+dimer threshold  @xcite , and thus does not qualify as an efimov state in this definition  @xcite .",
    "3 .   in their review article  @xcite , eric braaten and",
    "hans - werner hammer advocated a broader definition : `` a trimer is defined to be an efimov state if a deformation that tunes the scattering length to @xmath245 moves its binding energy along the universal curve '' . in this definition , the trimer does not have to meet the particle+dimer threshold on the positive scattering length side .",
    "the ground state trimer is therefore usually an efimov state according to this definition .",
    "4 .   the results of refs .  @xcite suggest a somewhat related definition : a trimer is defined to be an efimov state if the trimer energy as a function of @xmath163 can be fitted by the modified universal formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : modifieduniversalformula ] ) .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have presented numerical evidence that close to unitarity the ground state is expected to be an efimov state in this definition .",
    "the first two definitions are qualitative : a given state is either an efimov state or not .",
    "the last two definitions are less restrictive and can be made quantitative : by comparing the energy with the universal or modified universal formulas , one may quantify how much of an efimov state a given trimer is .",
    "the disadvantage of definitions 2 , 3 , and 4 is that they require the variation of the two - body scattering length , which is not always possible experimentally if the interactions can not be controlled but are just set by nature .    from a physical point of view",
    ", it would be natural to say that a trimer is an efimov state if the efimov attraction is present and necessary to ensure its binding , although this point is difficult to characterise experimentally , and even theoretically for real systems .",
    "we should mention that the notion of efimov trimer is not restricted to bound states and can be extended to resonant states .",
    "when the two - body interaction potential supports several two - body bound states and one of them has zero angular momentum and is very close to threshold , it leads to a situation similar to what the efimov theory predicts for just one two - body bound state , except that the efimov trimers are resonant states that can dissociate into a particle and a deeper two - body bound state .",
    "such resonant states are shown as dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : efimovplotfiniterange ] . as long as this dissociation is weak , the trimer resnonances are narrow and follow the efimov scenario",
    ". they can therefore be qualified as efimov states .",
    "in fact , it is the situation encountered in ultra - cold atomic gases - see section  [ subsec : ultracold - atoms ] . for very strong losses by dissociation , the trimer resonances are broad and a theoretical study indicates that the efimov spectrum is rotated in the complex energy plane  @xcite , where the imaginary part of the energy correspond to the resonance width .",
    "although the peculiar energy spectrum of efimov states is often presented as their defining characteristic , their spatial structure is also worth considering , as it makes them very different from other three - body bound states such as water or ozone molecules .",
    "ozone molecules , for instance , have a relatively well defined geometry , with an o - o length of about 0.127  nm and an o - o - o angle of about 117 .",
    "although the electrons are delocalised around the oxygen nuclei , the relative positions of the nuclei are quite localised , as a result of the strong binding interaction provided by the bonding electrons .",
    "efimov states , on the other hand , are very diffuse objects without a well defined geometry .    in the intuitive picture of the efimov attraction ,",
    "the particles keep moving back and forth between one another , thereby inducing the efimov attraction that keeps them together .",
    "thus , for an efimov state made of atoms , one may say that the atoms themselves play the role of bonding electrons by performing an exchange motion . the electrons play a role only when the atoms come in contact , within the radius of their electronic cloud , which is on the order of a few tenths of nanometre for light atoms .",
    "the motion of the atoms , on the other hand , occurs at distances larger than the size of their electronic cloud , around three times for the ground state and much more for excited states . as result ,",
    "efimov states of atoms are much larger and diffuse than usual molecules .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : molecules ] for the case of helium-4 trimers , whose excited state is typically fifty times or more larger than ozone molecules .",
    "in addition to the broad distribution of sizes , there is also a broad distribution of geometries for three particles forming an efimov state .",
    "the most probable geometries in this distribution correspond to elongated triangles , where two particles are relatively close and the third one is farther away .",
    "this can be checked at unitarity from the hyper - angular wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyperangularsolution ] ) , which peaks at @xmath78 , corresponding to two particles in contact with the third particle away . for the full wave function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : faddeevdecomposition ] ) , one obtains the average value of @xmath74 to be close to @xmath246 , corresponding to an elongated triangle .",
    "these distinctive structural properties can be used to experimentally characterise a trimer as an efimov state , when structural properties can be measured .",
    "this was recently demonstrated in the coulomb explosion imaging of helium-4 trimers  @xcite - see section  [ subsec : helium-4 ] .",
    "this experiment revealed that the distribution of geometries for the excited trimer state of helium-4 conforms to the distribution of an efimov state favouring elongated triangles , whereas the distribution for the ground state is broader and does not seem to favour any particular geometry .",
    "this is due to the fact that finite - range effects are more important for the ground state and tend to push the system to a more equilateral configuration ( see a discussion of this effect in section  [ par : connection - with - two - body - physics ] ) .",
    "for this reason , ground - state efimov trimers are in general not expected to exhibit the distribution of geometries of an ideal efimov state .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of a well - defined geometry make even the ground - state efimov trimers very distinct from conventional molecules , as fig .",
    "[ fig : molecules ] illustrates .",
    "bosonic particles in nuclear physics are compounds of fermions . in the case of nucleons , since neutrons do not bind , bosonic clusters have to involve protons .",
    "this introduces coulomb interactions which do not qualify as short - range interactions . nevertheless ,",
    "as discussed in section  [ subsec : coulomb - interactions ] , efimov physics can survive in this context : if the short - range nuclear interactions are resonant , they create a three - body efimov attraction that competes with the coulomb repulsion to form bound states . although these states do not necessary follow the definitions of efimov states put forward in section  [ subsec : efimovenergy ] , they could still be regarded as efimov states in the sense of being bound by the efimov attraction . a necessary condition for the efimov attraction to survive",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditionforefimovincoulombsystems ] ) .",
    "this condition can only be satisfied by light nuclei .",
    "the hoyle state is an excited resonant state of carbon-12 predicted by fred hoyle in 1954 .",
    "it plays a crucial role in the stellar nucleosynthesis of carbon . in his original papers",
    "@xcite , vitaly  efimov suggested that the hoyle state may be viewed as a trimer of alpha particles ( i.e. helium nuclei , which are bosons ) bound by the efimov attraction .",
    "the works of renato higa and hans - werner hammer  @xcite based on effective - field theory looks into the effect of the coulomb interactions on alpha systems close to unitarity .",
    "they conjectured that the hoyle state is indeed a remnant of the efimov spectrum broken by the coulomb interaction , surviving as a resonance above the three - alpha scattering threshold .",

    "this picture is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hoyleefimov ] .",
    "although this picture of the hoyle state is quite appealing , there are two points that make it questionable .",
    "first , excluding the coulomb repulsion , the nuclear force between two alpha particles does not seem to be resonant , as the scattering length of the model potentials  @xcite for the alpha - alpha interaction is about 5  fm , which is similar to the range @xmath10 and effective range @xmath247  fm of these potentials .",
    "the resonance condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonancecondition ] ) may therefore not be satisfied .",
    "this would suggest that the attraction between alpha particles is directly due to the nuclear force rather than the efimov attraction .",
    "second , even if the alpha - alpha interaction is resonant , the efimov attraction seems too weak to overcome the coulomb repulsion and support a resonant state at distances larger than the range @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the value of the bohr radius given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bohrradius ] ) for alpha particles is @xmath248  fm .",
    "the condition @xmath249 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditionforefimovincoulombsystems ] ) therefore does not appear to be satisfied .",
    "these conclusions rely on rough estimates , and only a full treatment of the three - body problem with short - range and coulomb interactions can give a definite answer .",
    "the three - body model calculation of the hoyle state by hiroya suno , yasuyuki suzuki , and pierre descouvemont  @xcite gives a preliminary answer . in their work , they show the contributions from the coulomb , nuclear and centrifugal ( kinetic ) energies as a function of the hyper - radius .",
    "although an attractive well ( presumably due to the efimov attraction ) can be seen in the centrifugal energy , it appears that it is not enough to overcome the coulomb repulsion , and it is the nuclear force that is responsible for the stability of the hoyle state in this model .",
    "it is therefore likely that the hoyle state may not be considered as an efimov state .",
    "most atomic species have bosonic isotopes , and interactions between neutral atoms is of the short - range type , decaying with a @xmath198 van der waals tail .",
    "they therefore appear as ideal systems for the observation of the efimov physics of identical bosons described previously . however , the remaining condition that the interaction be resonant is more difficult to satisfy .    in most cases ,",
    "the scattering length is on the order of the range of the atomic interaction . only in accidental cases",
    "does the scattering length happen to be much larger than the range of the interaction .",
    "such is the case of helium-4 atoms discussed below . for a long time",
    ", helium-4 appeared as the only promising atomic species for observing efimov states .",
    "the situation changed drastically with the implementation of magnetic feshbach resonances in ultra - cold atoms experiments  @xcite . thanks to these resonances , it has been possible to change at will the scattering length between various species of atoms by simply varying the strength of an applied magnetic field . this has enabled a detailed exploration of efimov physics in these atomic systems .",

    "however , the ground - state trimer is also an efimov state .    to appreciate how the two trimer states of helium-4 fit in the efimov picture",

    "a feshbach resonance  @xcite is a general resonance phenomenon of particles with different possible internal states ( for instance , hyperfine states in the case of atoms ) .",

    "however , for atoms commonly used in ultra - cold gases , these potentials also support many other two - body bound states that are more deeply bound , i.e. diatomic molecular states of various rotational symmetries .",
    "this introduces two complications with respect to the ideal efimov scenario .",
    "the first one is that the many diatomic molecular levels experience different zeeman shifts as the magnetic field is varied to tune the scattering length .",
    "this can result in a second molecular state reaching the threshold and creating a feshbach resonance overlaping with the resonance of interest , thus complicating the relationship between the magnetic field and the scattering length .",
    "this situation is illustrated by the many overlapping feshbach resonances of cesium-133 ground - state atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , when the two resonances have very different widths , the efimov physics associated with one resonance may not be significantly affected by the presence of the other .",
    "a second consequence of the different zeeman shifts of the molecular levels is that there can be many avoided crossings between these levels .",
    "sometimes such a crossing may strongly affect the @xmath4-wave two - body bound state associated with the feshbach resonance , resulting in a quick departure from the zero - range picture .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the cesium dimer associated with the feshbach resonance near 800  g , which remains very close to the threshold due to an avoided crossing with a weakly bound molecular level of the open channel  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the efimov effect still occurs close to resonance .",
    "the second complication is that efimov trimers are not true bound states , since they have a much smaller binding energy than the many diatomic molecular states . instead",
    ", these trimers exist as resonances embedded in the continua formed by the scattering of one atom and one diatomic molecule , as shown by the dotted curves in fig .",

    ", these trimers have a finite lifetime as they can decay in these continua by dissociating into an atom and diatomic molecule .",
    "this situation is different from that of helium-4 , for which the potential supports only one two - body bound state and efimov trimers are true bound states that are infinitely long lived . nevertheless , the dissociation processes are weak enough to allow to resolve the trimer resonances , which were found to conform to the general efimov scenario .",
    "it is for this reason that these resonances are thought to be a good approximation of efimov states , even though they are not true bound states .",

    "three - body bound states can be formed through inelastic collisions  @xcite but these states are difficult to observe in the standard setups .",

    "the discrete scale invariance is however broken below a certain energy scale associated with the coupling strength @xmath106 , making the number of trimers finite , as the excited trimers are pushed into the particle - dimer threshold .",

    "second , they carry a spin 1/2 , and can therefore be in two distinguishable states , or more precisely they can form a spin singlet state .",
    "this particular configuration is free of the centrifugal repulsion that is otherwise present for fermions in a triplet state ( such as two identical fermions ) and would suppress the efimov attraction . *",

    "[ fig : table - of - nuclides ] . numerous experiments and analyses have determined that they can be described as a compact core nucleus surrounded by one or few loosely bound nucleons forming a diffuse halo around the core  @xcite .",

    "examples of two - neutron halo nuclei are helium-6 , lithium-11 , boron-17 , boron-19 and carbon-22 .",
    "helium-8 is considered to be a four - neutron halo nucleus .    at first sight ,",
    "halo nuclei look very similar to the situation described by the zero - range theory of section [ subsec : efimov - theory ] .",
    "the one - neutron halos can be recognised as the universal dimer supported by a resonant short - range interaction , assuming that the effective interaction between the neutron and the core is resonant in the @xmath4 wave .",
    "it is thus tempting to identify the two - neutron halo nuclei with efimov states composed of a core and two neutrons , in accordance with the discussion at the beginning of section  [ subsec : observations - in - nuclear - multi - component ] .",
    "this identification would naturally explain a number of features such as the large extent of halo nuclei and the borromean nature of some of them",
    ".    however , there may also be significant differences preventing the identification of halo nuclei with efimov states .",
    "for instance , the two - neutron halo nucleus of helium-6 is known to feature a @xmath288-wave resonance between the core and one neutron , in addition to their @xmath4-wave interaction . as seen in section  [ subsec : resonant - p - wave - interactions ] , @xmath288-wave resonances do not lead to the discrete scale invariance of efimov physics .",
    "therefore , halo nuclei such as helium-6 can not be considered as efimov states , although they may be described by universal models  @xcite .",
    "another difficulty is that one would expect to find efimov states by adding one neutron to the one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath544be and @xmath545c , but @xmath546be and @xmath547c are not currently recognised as two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "it is usually thought that for these systems , the second neutron forms a cooper pair with the first neutron , which condenses with the other pairs of the core , making the nucleus more compact .",
    "however , it is not excluded that @xmath546be and @xmath547c may constitute efimov ground states nonetheless .",
    "indeed , the experimental characterisation of halo nuclei relies on the measurement of anomalously large cross sections and narrow momentum distributions of neutrons .",
    "while such features are expected for a ground efimov state close to the two - body or three - body thresholds where its size becomes very large , the ground efimov state for interactions near unitarity is relatively compact , with a typical size only marginally larger than the range of interactions .",
    "this situation could explain why the nuclei obtained by adding one neutron to a one - neutron halo nucleus are more compact and not recognised as halo states .",
    "the assumption that the core remains inert in such compact states is however questionable .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist two - neutron halo nuclei , such as @xmath544li and @xmath548c , with no corresponding one - neutron halo nucleus .",
    "these nuclei could therefore correspond to borromean efimov states of a core and two neutrons , for which the core - neutron subsystems are unbound but have a virtual state close to threshold ( such as @xmath549li which is observed as a resonance ) .",
    "such efimov states are typically much larger in size than the range of interactions , which would explain the halo structure of these nuclei .    in summary , although not all two - neutron halo nuclei are manifestations of efimov states ( @xmath319he is not ) , some halo nuclei ( such as @xmath544li and @xmath548c ) are possibly ground - state efimov trimers in the borromean regime , and other nuclei which are not experimentally regarded as halo nuclei ( such as @xmath546be and @xmath547c ) could be ground - state efimov trimers close to the unitary limit . for these nuclei ,",
    "all interactions ( core - neutron and neutron - neutron ) are assumed to be resonant , and the neutrons can be in a symmetric state ( spin singlet ) . if the core has spin zero , the situation is equivalent to that of two identical bosons and one particle with three resonantly - interacting pairs , as described in section  [ subsec:2-bosons+1particle ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 + 1 ] .",

    "however , the situation is different for particles moving in subspaces of different dimensions @xmath665 .",

    "of course , for a two - body contact interaction to take place , these disjoint subspaces must intersect the space of the third particle .",
    "this way , both particles can interact with the third particle , and thus the third particle can mediate interaction between the two particles .",
    "yet , the two particles are always spatially separated and can not come in contact .",
    "this has two major consequences .",
    "first , the statistics of the particles does not matter any more , because they can be regarded as distinguishable particles , being with certainty in different locations .",
    "thus , the pauli repulsion between identical fermions that limits the efimov effect to sufficiently large mass ratios , does not play a role any more . in such mixed - dimensional settings , fermions always exhibit the efimov effect .",
    "second , even though two of the three particles can come in contact , the three particles can never come closer than the separation between the two disjoint subspaces . in systems undergoing loss by three - recombination ( such as ultra - cold atoms ) , this fact can completely suppress the loss , by preventing the three particles from coming all three at distances where recombination occurs .",
    "it is thus a clever way to realise efimov states that are inherently stable , unlike their counterpart in free space .",
    "since the separation @xmath194 between the two subspaces constitutes the smallest distance that the three particles can come to , it is the length scale that breaks the discrete scale invariance and determines the ground - state energy and three - body parameter of the trimers . in particular , at unitarity , @xmath668 @xmath669 the constants @xmath670 and @xmath74 have been calculated numerically by yusuke nishida and shina tan for both the bilayer - free ( 2d@xmath6712d@xmath6713d ) and biwire - free ( 1d@xmath6711d@xmath6713d ) geometries , for the two mass ratios 40/6 and 6/40 .",

    "their calculation indicates that the strength ratio could vary from 2/3  to  1 , although it is often close to  0.8 , which suggests a nominal value for the three - body parameter , supporting view  1 .",

    "it is worthwhile to note that this is the first and so far the only known example of the four - body efimov effect in any physical system : for a four - body system of bosons , the four - body efimov effect does not occur  @xcite , and there exists only a finite number of four - body bound states tied to each efimov trimers  @xcite - see section  [ subsec:4-body - states - associated ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that some of the four - body efimov states are likely to persist beyond the three - body critical mass ratio @xmath909 , while some others are expected to mix with the trimer+fermion scattering continua .",
    "below the four - body efimov critical mass ratio @xmath908 , there is no universal four - body bound state at the unitary limit .",

    "several studies have recently started to address this question .",
    "the first studies have looked into the influence of a many - body background onto efimov states , while more recent studies deal with the consequences of few - body efimov physics at the many - body level .",
    "the observation of efimov physics in ultra - cold atom experiments involve the existence of triatomic molecules that can be formed from an extremely dilute cloud of atoms . even though the density of the cloud , typically @xmath915 atoms per cubic centimetre , is small enough to regard the triatomic molecules as isolated , it is natural to wonder how the properties of such molecules are changed under the influence of a surrounding medium .",
    "it is particularly interesting that the medium may be composed of the same constituents as the those of the molecule , as this consideration constitutes a first step towards many - body problems .",
    "depending on the quantum statistics of the constituents , there are thus two possible media , a fermi sea or a bose gas .",
    "let us consider an efimov trimer containing one or several fermionic particles , and surrounded by one or several seas of fermions that are identical to those of the efimov trimer .",
    "the presence of these many additional fermions constitutes a non - trivial many - body problem , but it can be treated in a first approximation as a static fermi sea . in this case , the main effect of the fermi sea is to prevent the fermions in the efimov trimer from occupying the states already occupied by the other fermions , owing to the pauli exclusion between identical fermions . this idea has been explored in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite . generally speaking",
    ", the pauli exclusion tends to reduce the binding of the efimov trimer . for a large enough density of the fermi seas",

    "the authors thus used the born - oppenheimer approximation , along with a semi - classical approximation , to calculate the three - body spectrum with the constraint the fermion can not occupy states of momenta smaller than the fermi momentum @xmath917 of the fermi sea . since this constraint breaks the translational invariance , the total momentum of the system does not simply shift the energy of the spectrum . for simplicity , the authors restricted their consideration to states of zero total momentum . for @xmath918",

    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite estimated that the polarisation of the sea would reduce even further the binding of the efimov trimers .",
    "on the other hand , charles j. m. mathy and co - workers  @xcite found in a somewhat different system that the polarisation of the sea may on the contrary enhance the stability of trimers .",
    "this work considers the case of a trimer made of a light fermion and two heavy fermions ( known as kartavtsev - malykh universal trimer , see section  [ subsec : kartavtsev - malykh - universal - trimers ] ) , surrounded by a sea of identical heavy fermions .",
    "the authors used a variational ansatz involving both the trimer and the particle - hole excitation and found that the stability of the trimer is enhanced by a moderate density of the fermi sea .        the case of efimov trimers in a bec ( bose - einstein condensate ) has been considered by nikolaj thomas zinner in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that study , two heavy particles ( impurities ) resonantly interact with bosons from a surrounding condensate of bosons . at low density",

    "the author of ref .",
    "@xcite thus used the born - oppenheimer approximation to calculate the effective interaction between the two heavy particles at fixed separations . to treat the effect of the surrounding condensate , the author used the bogoliubov approach  @xcite to describe the bosons as a ground - state condensate with quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the author then retained only the coupling to quasi - particles , resulting in a three - body problem for two heavy impurities and a quasi - particle .",
    "although the validity of this approximation is not clear , it leads to results that are similar to those of ref .",
    "the resulting born - oppenheimer potential between the two heavy impurities is influenced by the medium at large separations @xmath72 , on the order of the coherence length @xmath136 of the condensate . in this region ,",
    "the bonding potential is reduced with respect to the bonding potential in the absence of condensate ( see section  [ subsec : the - born - oppenheimer - picture ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : bonding - potential ] ) , resulting in a faster decay .",
    "this in turn reduces the binding of the efimov states , as in the case of a fermi sea .",
    "however , in this theory , the potential appears to be not defined beyond a certain separation @xmath919 , so that these preliminary conclusions are to be confirmed by a more consistent theory .",
    "systems of a single impurity atom resonantly interacting with a bose condensate have recently been realised by two independent groups ; one with potassium-39 atoms in two different hyperfine states by the group of jan arlt at aarhus university  @xcite , and the other one with a mixture of rubidium-87 and potassium-40 by the group of eric cornell , and deborah jin at jila  @xcite .",
    "efimov states may appear in these systems since two identical bosons can bind with the impurity to form an efimov trimer , as discussed in section  [ subsec:2-bosons+1particle ] .",
    "this possibility was explicitly taken into account for the impurity - bec system in the work of jesper levinsen , meera m. parish , and georg m. bruun  @xcite , by constructing a variational ansatz that includes up to two bogoliubov excitations of the bec .",
    "this allows to take into account the three - body correlations of the impurity with two bosons of the condensate .",
    "if one includes only two - body correlations , the resulting variational ground - state is a `` bose polaron '' , i.e. the impurity is dressed by the surrounding condensate and , as the impurity - boson interaction is increased , progressively binds with one of the bosons to form a dimer surrounded by the remaining bosons .",
    "by contrast , taking into account three - body correlations , the bose polaron instead turns into a trimer composed of the impurity bound to two bosons and surrounded by the remaining bosons .",
    "the authors indicate that this state may be seen as the avoided crossing between the two - body correlated polaron with the vacuum ground - state efimov trimer composed of the impurity and two bosons . in the experiments @xcite , such an avoided crossing could not be observed since the efimov trimers are much larger than the mean atomic distance , but it would appear if one can prepare a gas with much smaller density .",
    "interestingly , the energy of the trimer dressed by the medium is lower than that of the vacuum trimer , showing that in this case the surrounding condensate stabilises the efimov trimer .",
    "given these results , it would be tempting to think that by taking a larger number of bogoliubov excitations , one could couple the polaron to universal clusters similar to those discussed in section  [ subsec:3-fermions-+1particle ] , such as a tetramer formed of three bosons and the impurity . while this is certainly to be expected , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that the couplings to these clusters would be smaller than that to the trimer , and possibly negligible .",
    "their argument is that the repulsive interaction between the bosons tend to reduce the coupling between the polaron and universal clusters .",
    "they checked that the coupling to the trimer is indeed reduced when the scattering length @xmath163 between the bosons is increased , relative to the scattering length @xmath254 between a boson and the impurity at which the trimer appears .",
    "since universal clusters are expected to appear at scattering lengths between a boson and the impurity that are even smaller than @xmath920 , they expect that the reduction of the coupling is comparatively stronger for larger clusters .",
    "luis aldemar pea ardila and stefano giorgini have also arrived at a similar conclusion with a quantum monte carlo calculation @xcite .",
    "since it became possible to adjust the scattering length of ultra - cold atoms close to unitarity thanks to magnetic feshbach resonances , experimentalists have hoped to realise the unitary bose gas , an intriguing strongly - correlated system which theorists have been excited about for many years  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some theorists have wondered about the role of efimov physics in such a gas , and how it can be described by the three - body parameter of the atoms , unlike the unitary fermi gas which has no microscopic length scale .",
    "unfortunately , when the scattering length is tuned to large values , ultra - cold bosonic gases are found to be very unstable , especially in the quantum degenerate regime , because of enhanced loss by recombination of the atoms into the many bound states that exist for atomic interactions .",
    "it is for this reason that efimov trimers in ultra - cold gases have been evidenced essentially through features in these losses , rather than more direct obervations .",

    "we review some theoretical and experimental works that attempt to reveal the role of efimov physics in an atomic bose gas .",
    "shina tan  @xcite has introduced a set of universal relations for the two - component fermi gas that relates its properties to the scattering length @xmath26 between two different fermions through the strength of two - particle short - range correlations , characterised by an extensive quantity called the `` contact '' @xmath925 .",

    "however , it is challenging to observe many - body physics induced by these efimov trimers in ultra - cold atom experiments , because such efimov trimers , when made of atoms , are unstable against recombination into an atom plus a tightly bound dimer ( see section 15.1 ) . on the other hand , the universal trimers , which are remnants of the efimov trimers in the range of mass ratios @xmath954 , are stable against three - body recombination thanks to the repulsion created by the pauli exclusion principle ( see section  [ subsec : kartavtsev - malykh - universal - trimers ] ) .",
    "therefore , a gas composed of the universal trimers seems to be a promising candidate to observe a stable efimov - induced many - body phase in ultra - cold atoms .",

    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "considering the mass ratio @xmath955 to avoid the formation of universal tetramers ( see ref  @xcite and section  [ subsec : universal - four - body - bound ] ) , a stable many - body phase of the universal trimers has been predicted to exist in a range of scattering lengths and population imbalance between heavy and light fermions .",
    "when the scattering length is small and positive so that the binding energy of the universal trimer is large enough , the trimer can be regarded as a point - like composite fermion , having three internal degrees of freedom originating from its angular momentum @xmath453 .",
    "the trimer gas thus becomes a three - component fermi gas , each component corresponding to one of the three rotational states , @xmath956 .",
    "since the @xmath4-wave interaction between the universal trimers would be the dominant interaction of the trimer phase at low energy , the authors have found that its low - energy effective hamiltonian has an su(3 ) symmetry .",

    "the interaction was found to be of the soft - core repulsion type , leading to a positive @xmath4-wave scattering length for the trimer - trimer scattering .",
    "this would imply that the corresponding trimer phase , in the limit of low density and low temperature , is not superfluid , but a three - component , su(3 ) fermi liquid  @xcite .",
    "we should note that the existence and nature of this trimer phase await further confirmation , since the crucial assumption about the absence of larger clusters ( e.g. pentamers , hexamers ) has not been precisely validated , and the method used to determine the trimer - trimer interaction is only approximate . while the mass ratio window @xmath957 seems rather restrictive , an ultra - cold mixture of @xmath958 and @xmath959 atoms falls into this window and is a promising candidate to confirm the existence and investigate the properties of this trimer phase .",
    "the efimov effect , in its most restrictive definition ( see section  [ subsec : what - is - an - efimov - state ] ) , could be simply regarded as an oddity in the energy spectrum of three particles with short - range interactions . on the other hand",
    ", it could be argued that the efimov effect is on the contrary a central concept around which a wide range of strongly - interacting systems may be described .",
    "such is the case of long - studied systems such as the tritium nucleus or two - neutron halo nuclei in nuclear physics  ( see sections  [ subsec : observations - in - nuclear ] and [ subsec : observations - in - nuclear - multi - component ] ) , or the triatomic molecule of helium-4 in atomic physics ( see section  [ subsec : observations - with - atoms ] ) .",
    "even though these systems may not be recognised as efimov states in the strictest sense , the efimov effect provides a simple framework for the existence of such compounds .",
    "the recent experimental observations with ultra - cold atoms and theoretical developments have now opened an even richer variety of systems related to efimov physics , from @xmath5-body universal clusters tied to efimov states , to the super - efimov effect , or mixed - dimensional efimov states .",

    "<S> this article reviews theoretical and experimental advances in efimov physics , an array of quantum few - body and many - body phenomena arising for particles interacting via short - range resonant interactions , that is based on the appearance of a scale - invariant three - body attraction theoretically discovered by vitaly efimov in 1970 . </S>",
    "<S> this three - body effect was originally proposed to explain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the hoyle state of carbon-12 , and later considered as a simple explanation for the existence of some halo nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it was subsequently evidenced in trapped ultra - cold atomic clouds and in diffracted molecular beams of gaseous helium . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments revealed that the previously undetermined three - body parameter introduced in the efimov theory to stabilise the three - body attraction typically scales with the range of atomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the few- and many - body consequences of the efimov attraction have been since investigated theoretically , and are expected to be observed in a broader spectrum of physical systems .    </S>",
