    "there is much observational evidence , starting with webster ( 1968 ) and pollard and millard ( 1970 ) , that storms can excite near - inertial currents in the mixed layer of the ocean .",
    "this phenomenon is evident in observations from the ocean storms experiment ( dasaro et al .",
    "1995 , levine and zervakis 1995 , qi et al .",
    "simple models which treat the mixed layer as a solid slab have been quite successful at explaining the process by which wind generates such currents ( see , e.g. , pollard and millard ( 1970 ) , dasaro ( 1985 ) ) .",
    "a weakness of the model of pollard and millard ( 1970 ) is that it explains the decay of these currents with an _ arbitrary _ decay constant .",
    "much subsequent work has attempted to determine the detailed characteristics of this decay , with possible mechanisms including nonlinear interactions which transfer energy to other frequencies ( henyey et al .",
    "1986 ) , turbulent dissipation ( hebert and moum 1993 ) , and the radiation of downward propagating near - inertial oscillations ( nios ) excited by inertial pumping into the interior of the ocean ( gill 1984 )",
    ". the downward radiation of nios will be the focus of this paper .",
    "observations give a timescale for the decay of the energy deposited by the passing storm on the order of ten to twenty days ( dasaro et al .",
    "1995 , levine and zervakis 1995 , qi et al .",
    "this timescale stands in contrast with estimates such as that by gill ( 1984 ) that near - inertial currents decaying through the downward propagation of nios and with a horizontal length scale typical of the atmospheric forcing mechanism can remain in the mixed layer for longer than a year . to account for this difference , several mechanisms for the enhancement of vertical propagation of nios have been suggested .",
    "dasaro ( 1989 ) demonstrated that the @xmath2-effect causes a reduction of horizontal scales because the meridional wavenumber evolves according to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the initial wavenumber , and @xmath5 corresponds to southward propagation ; this accelerates the rate of inertial pumping of energy out of the mixed layer , thereby enhancing the decay .",
    "the decay is also enhanced through interaction with background geostrophic or quasigeostrophic flow ( e.g.  balmforth et al .",
    "1998 , balmforth and young 1999 , and van meurs 1998 ) .",
    "this paper reconsiders the vertical propagation of near - inertial energy deposited into the mixed layer by a storm , in the presence of the @xmath2-effect , using a different approach from that of dasaro ( 1989 ) .",
    "the analysis uses the formalism of young and ben jelloul ( 1997 ) which is outlined in section 2 . in section 3 , a simplified model with three main assumptions",
    "is presented .",
    "first , the background flow is assumed to be constant in the zonal direction ( i.e.  independent of longitude with zero vorticity ) .",
    "second , the buoyancy frequency is taken to be small in the mixed layer , and constant in the ocean interior ( i.e.  beneath the mixed layer ) .",
    "third , it is assumed that the storm has moved very rapidly across the ocean and has created a horizontally uniform near - inertial current to the east concentrated within the mixed layer : it is the subsequent evolution of this motion that is examined .",
    "section 4 uses the fact that the depth of the ocean is very much larger than the mixed layer depth to formulate and solve the model for an ocean which is effectively infinitely deep .",
    "section 5 discusses the results and suggests directions for further investigation .",
    "we consider an ocean of infinite horizontal extent and depth @xmath6 , with the mixed layer comprising the region @xmath7 , and the rest of the water column occupying @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes are taken to point to the east and north , respectively .",
    "the buoyancy frequency @xmath11 is an arbitrary piecewise continuous function of depth  @xmath12 .",
    "young and ben jelloul ( 1997 ) derive an evolution equation for a complex field @xmath13 which governs leading - order nio motion in the presence of a steady barotropic background flow and the @xmath2-effect : @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the streamfunction for the background flow , @xmath17 is the associated vorticity , and the coriolis parameter is @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the horizontal gradient , and @xmath20 .",
    "subscripts denote partial differentiation .",
    "the nio velocity field @xmath21 , buoyancy @xmath22 , and pressure @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 the buoyancy @xmath22 is related to the density @xmath25 by @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the reference density at the top of the ocean .",
    "the pressure @xmath23 has been normalized by @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary conditions are that @xmath28 at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath31 vanishes at the top and bottom of the ocean .",
    "using these boundary conditions , @xmath32 thus barotropic motion is not included in the analysis . however gill ( 1984 ) has shown that the barotropic response to a storm is instantaneous and the associated currents are weak .",
    "to simplify the analysis , we assume that @xmath33 and @xmath16 do not vary in the @xmath9-direction , and that @xmath34 .",
    "the analysis thus neglects the effect of background barotropic vorticity but crucially keeps the @xmath2-effect .",
    "the buoyancy frequency profile is taken to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the storm is assumed to have produced an initial condition of a horizontally uniform near - inertial current to the east concentrated within the mixed layer . instead of approaching this problem by use of an integral operator as in dasaro ( 1989 ) or by projecting onto normal modes ( e.g. , gill 1984 , balmforth et al .",
    "1998 ) , the problem will be formulated as an initial value problem on a semi - infinite domain corresponding to an ocean that is effectively infinitely deep . in order to formulate the problem properly for this limit",
    ", this section considers an ocean of finite depth . in section 4",
    "the solution in the limit that the depth of the interior is much greater than the mixed layer depth will be found .",
    "this formulation as a radiation problem which ignores the presence of the ocean bottom requires the projection of the initial condition to be spread across all the normal modes .",
    "this is certainly true for small mixed layer depths in the model of gill ( 1984 ) , as shown in table 1 of that paper ; also see table 1 of zervakis and levin ( 1995 ) . for deeper mixed layers ,",
    "this is no longer true since half the initial energy becomes concentrated in the first two or three modes .",
    "however , as pointed in section 7 of gill ( 1984 ) , the depth of the ocean `` influences the rate of loss of energy by imposing modulations on the rate , but the average rate of loss is not affected very much by depth changes '' .",
    "hence the results presented here should be qualitatively relevant even when the continuum assumption is not valid .",
    "quantities are nondimensionalized according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 typical values @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath44 give @xmath46 @xmath42 and @xmath47 @xmath44 .",
    "the relevant timescale is thus @xmath48 days .",
    "also , the velocity and the field @xmath33 are nondimensionalized by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a characteristic value of the initial velocity .",
    "the hats are now dropped for ease of notation . with this nondimensionalization ,",
    "the buoyancy frequency profile is @xmath51 and the nio equation ( [ nio ] ) , the boundary conditions , and initial condition become @xmath52 the requirement that @xmath53 and @xmath54 remain finite imply the jump conditions @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the limits as @xmath58 from positive and negative @xmath12 values , respectively .",
    "this nondimensionalization allows some immediate conclusions to be drawn about the propagation of nio energy downwards .",
    "most importantly , if @xmath59 increases , then the timescale @xmath60 decreases .",
    "thus , assuming that the storm causes a uniform near - inertial current throughout the whole mixed layer , energy transfer will be faster for a deeper mixed layer .",
    "this confirms the results of gill ( 1984 ) , which associated the more efficient transfer with a larger projection of the initial velocity profile on the first vertical mode .",
    "expanding @xmath61 for @xmath62 , ( [ nio_nondim ] ) becomes at @xmath63 @xmath64 integrating this subject to the boundary condition that @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 vanishes at @xmath67 implies that @xmath68 is independent of @xmath12 . at @xmath69 ,",
    "@xmath70 which may be integrated subject to the boundary condition that @xmath71 vanishes at @xmath67 to give @xmath72 evaluating at @xmath56 and using @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 finally , applying ( [ jump_conditions ] ) gives the upper boundary condition for the nio field in the ocean interior to leading order in @xmath76 : @xmath77 results obtained in the ocean interior using ( [ eff_bc ] ) are in fact leading - order solutions .",
    "we shall continue to use the notation @xmath33 , even though it is really the leading - order term in the expansion .",
    "suppose that in a short time compared with the nio wave propagation time , the passing storm induces near - inertial currents in the mixed layer with a horizontal scale that is much larger than the one under consideration , and which can hence be taken to be uniform . for simplicity , the initial velocity ( consistent with equation ( [ no_barotropic ] ) )",
    "is assumed to be piecewise constant with depth : @xmath78 the weak flow in the ocean interior is necessary to ensure that the flow has no barotropic component . integrating equation ( [ ic ] ) with respect to @xmath12 and using the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] )",
    "gives at @xmath79 @xmath80",
    "the total depth of the ocean is typically on the order of a hundred times the depth of the mixed layer .",
    "thus , the limit of infinite depth is considered .",
    "the initial condition is taken to be equation ( [ ic2 ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath82 is taken to be @xmath83 , corresponding to the near - inertial velocities vanishing at infinite depth .",
    "of course , this limit excludes the possibility of reflections off the bottom of the ocean which may be important .",
    "finally , the boundary condition for @xmath57 given by equation ( [ eff_bc ] ) is used .",
    "hence the problem to be solved for the semi - infinite domain @xmath84 becomes @xmath85      these equations may be solved using laplace transforms .",
    "here we present only the major results ; further details are given in moehlis ( 1999 ) .",
    "we make the transformations @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 and define the laplace transform of @xmath89 by @xmath90 \\equiv \\int_0^\\infty \\tilde{b}(z , t)e^{-p t } dt.\\ ] ] then @xmath91 this laplace transform and its derivatives with respect to @xmath12 must be inverted numerically for the ocean interior ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "for the top of the ocean interior ( @xmath57 ) however , they may be obtained in closed form .",
    "for example , @xmath92.\\ ] ]    we now consider the back - rotated velocity @xmath93 , which filters out purely inertial motion at frequency @xmath94 .",
    "back - rotated velocities may be represented by hodographs which show the vector @xmath95 as curves parametrized by time . for @xmath96 , if these curves are traced out in a clockwise ( counterclockwise ) fashion , the corresponding motion has frequency larger ( smaller ) than @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ hodo_fig ] shows the back - rotated velocity at different locations .",
    "a common characteristic is that the magnitude of the back - rotated velocity starts at zero , reaches a peak value shortly after the storm , then decays away .",
    "the depth dependence of the back - rotated velocity is seen by comparing figure [ hodo_fig ] ( a ) and ( b ) , where both have @xmath97 and thus the same value of the coriolis parameter @xmath98 .",
    "qualitatively the results are the same , but closer to the mixed layer the direction change of the back - rotated velocity becomes slower , meaning that the frequency is closer to @xmath94 .",
    "an idea of the latitudinal dependence is seen by comparing figure [ hodo_fig ] ( a , c , d ) : at @xmath99 the hodograph is traced out in a clockwise fashion as for @xmath97 , but at @xmath100 it is traced out in a counterclockwise fashion .      the horizontal kinetic energy ( hke ) per unit area contained within the mixed layer is @xmath101 expanding @xmath102 in the mixed layer , ( [ nio_ml ] ) may be used to show that @xmath103 where @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "the initial condition within the mixed layer is @xmath106 .",
    "now @xmath33 is continuous across @xmath29 , and @xmath107 is independent of @xmath12 ( see section 3.2 ) . hence @xmath108 which may be inverted to give @xmath109 therefore the hke within the mixed layer is @xmath110    the time dependence of @xmath111 is shown in figure [ ml_fig ] .",
    "asymptotic results from abramowitz and stegun ( 1972 ) for the complementary error function imply that @xmath112 since the energy which leaves the mixed layer enters the interior of the ocean , this implies that for short times the energy in the interior increases like @xmath113 .",
    "this does not contradict the result from dasaro ( 1989 ) that for short times the thermocline energy grows like @xmath114 .",
    "that result assumes that the wind persists to generate a constant inertially oscillating velocity , and that there is no propagating inertial motion .",
    "here , the wind has an instantaneous effect , causing an initial horizontally uniform inertial current , and propagating inertial motion is included fully .",
    "another quantity of interest is the flux of hke . using ( [ nio_nondim ] ) and its complex",
    "conjugate gives @xmath115 assuming @xmath116 vanishes for @xmath117 and using equation ( [ bc ] ) , @xmath118 where @xmath119 gives the flux of hke from the region @xmath120 to the region @xmath121 .",
    "for this model , we consider the flux per unit area . integrating ( [ intflux_vd ] ) with respect to time shows that the quantity @xmath122 gives the total amount of hke which has penetrated into the region @xmath121 .",
    "note that @xmath123 corresponds to all the energy originally in the mixed layer having reached depths below @xmath124 .",
    "results for @xmath125 and @xmath126 obtained by numerically inverting the appropriate laplace transforms are shown in figure [ flux_fig ] .",
    "@xmath127 peaks at the nondimensionalized time @xmath128 ; for the typical values quoted in section 3.1 , this corresponds to about a week after the storm . from figure [ flux_fig](b ) and using the fact that whatever energy flows through @xmath57 must have initally been in the mixed layer , we see that by @xmath129 ( about 11.5 days after the storm ) nearly half of the energy associated with horizontal nio currents caused by the storm has left the mixed layer ; however , only about @xmath130 of the total energy has penetrated below @xmath131 . by @xmath132 ( about 23 days after the storm ) , @xmath133 of the total energy has left the mixed layer , but only @xmath134 has penetrated below @xmath131 .",
    "thus , at @xmath132 nearly a quarter of the total energy is contained in the distance @xmath59 immediately beneath the mixed layer .",
    "this is reminiscent of the accumulation of nio energy below the mixed layer seen in balmforth , llewellyn smith and young ( 1998 ) .",
    "this model thus gives reasonable estimates for the timescale for which the decay of nio energy occurs : for example , dasaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the mixed layer inertial energy was reduced to background levels by 21 days after the storm .",
    "figure [ profile_fig ] shows the vertical dependence of the hke and @xmath127 at different times .",
    "as time increases the instantaneous distribution of hke becomes more sharply peaked near the base of the mixed layer , but remains bounded ( asymptotically approaching unity ) because of energy conservation .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of near - inertial properties may be derived using the method of steepest descents ( see moehlis 1999 for details ) .",
    "this shows that in the limit of large @xmath135 , and along the `` rays '' @xmath136 , @xmath137 a useful way to represent the asymptotic results is to write @xmath138 in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath139 and then draw contour plots of quantities of physical interest in the @xmath140 plane : this is shown in figure [ asymptotic_zt_fig ] .    in the asymptotic limit for large @xmath141 , with @xmath12 constant , @xmath142 and @xmath127 decrease as time increases .",
    "note that @xmath141 is large for sufficiently large @xmath12 and/or @xmath139 .",
    "finally , moehlis ( 1999 ) also obtained results for the vertical shear @xmath143 . to leading order in @xmath76 ,",
    "the vertical shear within the mixed layer is zero .",
    "the results for vertical shear for the interior of the ocean lack physical realism because the model allows the shear to grow forever as a consequence of the initial infinite shear due to the discontinuity in the initial velocity profile .",
    "a simplified model has been developed to examine the decay due to the @xmath2-effect of near - inertial currents excited in the mixed layer by a passing storm .",
    "this decay occurs due to the radiation of downward propagating nios into the interior of the ocean .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are that the background flow does not vary in the longitudinal direction and has no associated vorticity , that the ocean has a simple ( piecewise constant ) buoyancy frequency profile , and that the storm has moved very quickly over the ocean causing a horizontally uniform near - inertial current concentrated in the mixed layer .",
    "the @xmath2-effect is included in the analysis and is responsible for the radiation of nios .",
    "because the depth of the mixed layer is much smaller than the total depth of the ocean , the problem is formulated in the limit of an effectively infinitely deep ocean ; the resultant initial value problem is solved by laplace transforms .",
    "analytical results are given for the horizontal kinetic energy density in the mixed layer , and results from the numerical inversion of the appropriate laplace transforms are given for horizontal kinetic energy , energy flux , and back - rotated velocity .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is also investigated .",
    "although this simplified model can not be expected to capture the full complexity of the aftermath of a storm passing the ocean , it does capture much of the observed behavior .",
    "most importantly , in the presence of the @xmath2-effect the decay of near - inertial mixed layer energy is found to occur on the appropriate timescale ( approximately twenty days ) , which confirms the analysis of dasaro ( 1989 ) and observations by dasaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , levine and zervakis ( 1995 ) , and qi et al .",
    "the main advantage of the approach described in this paper is that many aspects of the decay in the mixed layer are analytically obtained for all times , unlike dasaro ( 1989 ) which predicts the timescale for the decay in a short time limit or estimates it in terms of the time it takes normal modes to become out of phase ( cf .",
    "gill 1984 ) .",
    "extensions to a more realistic ocean and storm would involve including a more realistic buoyancy frequency profile ( for example , the profile used by gill 1984 ) , considering the effect of different initial velocities ( including both horizontal and vertical structure ) , and considering the effect of background flow .",
    "the study of all of these could use the same formalism of young and ben jelloul ( 1997 ) and an approach similar to that presented here .",
    "the majority of this work was carried out at the 1999 geophysical fluid dynamics program at the woods hole oceanographic institution .",
