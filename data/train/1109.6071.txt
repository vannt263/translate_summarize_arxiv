    "blue supergiant phase is a very transient , short - lived evolutionary phase of massive stars ( @xmath1 ) , and hence the study of the internal structure of these core - collapse supernova progenitors could bring important constraints on the mass , size , composition and rotation rate of the he core prior to the collapse .",
    "this , however , depends critically on how different mixing mechanisms such as overshooting , semi - convection and rotation are treated during the main sequence ( ms ) phase of massive stars ( heger et al . 2000 ; noels et al . 2010 ) . in this respect",
    ", we find rigel an excellent testbed for such investigations .",
    "saio et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected 48 pulsation modes in the most post - ms target hd 163899 ( b2 ib / ii ) .",
    "they explained the excitation of observed g - modes in terms of mode reflection from the deep lying intermediate convective zone ( icz ) when they arrive at the appropriate phase to the edge of the icz .",
    "godart et al .",
    "( 2009 ) theoretically investigated the destructive effects of mass loss and core overshooting on the location and extent of the icz , and the asteroseismic potential of this class of stars .",
    "since a limited number of modes can survive the huge radiative damping in the core , they propose to artificially impose the inner boundary condition at the base of icz . according to saio ( 2011 )",
    "expected instabilities for stars like rigel are radial modes in addition to @xmath2 and 2 convection g@xmath3 modes .",
    "however , gautschy ( 2009 ) predicts no instability for stars with @xmath4 ( rigel lies in this gap ) . this is why asteroseismology of rigel could be model - dependent and demanding .",
    "several observed quantities of rigel which impose valuable constraints on the equilibrium model of the star are already measured .",
    "they are the hipparcos parallax @xmath5 mas , effective temperature @xmath6 k , surface gravity @xmath7 , luminosity @xmath8 , metalicity [ m / h]=@xmath9 ( przybilla et al .",
    "2006 ) , surface he abundance @xmath10 , @xmath11 km s@xmath12 ( przybilla et al .",
    "2010 ; simon - diaz et al .",
    "2010 ) , and limb darkened angular diameter @xmath13 mas . moreover , rigel s variability in the h@xmath14 line profile ( kaufer et al .",
    "1996 ; morisson et al . 2008 ) and other metal - line equivalent widths due to non - radial pulsations ( kaufer et al . 1997 ) and mass loss ( @xmath15 yr@xmath12 , chesneau et al .",
    "2010 ) are already published .",
    "these observed values are later tried to be reproduced when modeling the star . when modeling the equilibrium state of rigel ( section [ s : graco ] )",
    "we attempted to match the above mentioned observed quantities with the modeled quantities .",
    "photometry of rigel was carried out with most ( walker et al .",
    "2003 ) satellite for 27.7 days from 15 november to 13 december 2009 . since",
    "our photometry time - baseline is of the same order of the long - period modes no definite frequencies are found in lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the rv monitoring , in return , extends over 6 years but suffers from daily and annual gaps .",
    "we detected 19 significant harmonics using ` sigspec ` software ( reegen 2007 ) above sig@xmath1615 threshold ; the results are in complete agreement with those of ` perod04 ` software ( lenz & breger 2005 ) with snr@xmath174.6 .",
    "the extensive list of harmonics will be presented in moravveji et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the two lowest frequencies occur at 0.0152 and 0.0134 d@xmath12 with semi - amplitudes of 1.126 and 0.838 km s@xmath12 , respectively , and the highest frequency occurs at 0.8203 d@xmath12 .",
    "stellar structure and evolution modeling which includes rotational mixing ( heger et al .",
    "2000 ) , mass loss , and element diffusion subject to constraints listed in section [ s : intro ] is carried out with the ` mesa ` code ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) . schwarzschild criterion for convection with @xmath18 is used .",
    "so , the main source of energy is a slight he burning in the core followed by h burning in shell . but models with ledoux convective criterion have no he burning core ( godart et al . 2009 ) .",
    "since non - adiabaticity can play a critical role in excitation and damping of modes in massive stars , we treat modal stability analysis employing granada oscillatin code ( ` graco ` , moya et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the input equilibrium model from ` mesa ` , first we scan for @xmath19 modes in adiabatic frame , and next we solve the full non - adiabatic equations . even without imposing the inner boundary condition at the base of the icz ( suggested by godart et al .",
    "2009 ) , there are several unstable high order low - degree _ mixed _ gravity modes as eigensolutions .",
    "fundamental radial mode and its overtones are all stable . the radiative layer below the icz where h - burning takes place shows significant contribution in eigenfunction of excited modes . after analyzing the work integral @xmath20 and its derivative @xmath21",
    ", we speculate that the pulsation driving arises from the @xmath0mechanism ( unno et al . 1989 ) .",
    "this is powered by the sensitivity of the cno burning network to the temperature perturbations below the icz of @xmath22 which dominates over @xmath23mechanism around iron bump of opacity located at @xmath24 .",
    "if securely proven , this approach will open a venue towards studies of near - core condition in progenitors of sn ii progenitors .",
    "this part of the study is still under progress ."
