    "<S> an infinitesimal external field can pin one of these degenerate vacuua . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the broken - symmetry state has an effective classical description in which the environmental degrees of freedom are relaxed around a specific state of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding uncertainty is zero and so is the von neumann entropy . in the disordered state , by contrast , infinitesimal field has only infinitesimal effect . </S>",
    "<S> right at the quantum critical point , the qubit is maximally entangled with the environment , as will be shown below . </S>",

    "<S> [ hamiltonian ] , the reduced density matrix of the spin degree of freedom is determined by the expectation values @xmath88 and @xmath89 : @xmath90 after diagonalizing @xmath91 , we can easily compute the ground state von neumann entropy . </S>",
    "<S> hence the behavior of the entanglement at the qpt follows directly from the behavior of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> since the order parameter @xmath89 is discontinuous at the transition , the von neumann entropy also jumps by an amount @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the supplementary information , the magnitude of this jump is , to leading order in @xmath31 , @xmath93 in the limit of vanishing @xmath31 , the system goes from being unentangled ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) to being maximally entangled ( @xmath96 ) as it enters the disordered state . </S>",
    "<S> note that this result depends crucially on a proper treatment of the broken symmetry  without the jump in the order parameter , @xmath27 would be continuous through the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize that the von neumann entropy is discontinuous ( with a singular derivative ) even though the correlation length in imaginary time diverges at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> because this divergence takes the form of an essential singularity , it does not leave a strong signature in other quantities at the critical point .    </S>",
