    "this is a trigonometric polynomial in @xmath609 of degree 3 .",
    "it is an odd function of @xmath609 and so is of the form @xmath613 times a polynomial of degree two in @xmath614 .",
    "since it has at least a double zero at @xmath605 ( by the choice of @xmath428 and @xmath447 ) the polynomial must have a factor @xmath615 . since it is an odd function of @xmath256 it must also have a double zero at @xmath616 , so there must also be a factor @xmath617 . thus it must be equal to a constant times @xmath618 . in particular there can be no other zeros .",

    "we have shown that the matrix ( [ absum ] ) acting on @xmath463 scales in trace norm to the kernel @xmath663 acting on @xmath480 .",

    "for schur measure there are two interesting limiting cases : the exponential limit and the poisson limit . the exponential limit of shifted schur measure is supported on standard shifted tableaux ; and hence , it is expressible in terms of @xmath680 ( recall ( [ shiftedsyt ] ) ) . the poisson limit of shifted schur measure yields a natural interpretation of the maximizing rule as a symmetry condition of the process .",
    "namely , if one sets @xmath681 and takes @xmath682 , the percolation - type model described in  [ rsksec ] becomes the following : consider two poisson processes of rate @xmath683 both in the ( same ) square @xmath684\\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "hence one can imagine two types of points , marked and unmarked , in the square .",
    "now with probability one no two points , whether marked or unmarked , have the same @xmath7 or @xmath9 coordinates ; and hence , the strictly increasing conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of   [ rsksec ] for the rule of the maximizing path are not necessary .",
    "therefore , we do not need to distinguish the unmarked and marked points . since the union of two poisson processes has the rate @xmath685 , the reulting process is as follows : in the square @xmath684\\times [ 0,1]$ ] select poisson points of rate @xmath685 .",
    "then take the longest path starting from the lower right corner @xmath686 that follows an up / left path , turns in direction once and only once , and follows an up / right path ending at the upper right corner @xmath687 .",
    "it is clear that this length is also equal to the following symmetric version .",
    "take a realization of the poisson process .",
    "take the mirror image of the points about the left side .",
    "adjoin the mirror image on the left and the original points on the right .",
    "hence the resulting rectangle has sides of lengths @xmath357 and @xmath688 , and there are twice as many points of the orginal configuration which are symmetric about the center vertical line .",
    "the ( usual ) longest up / right path from the left lower corner to the right upper corner is precisely the longest maximizing path from the lower right corner to the upper right corner in the above description .",
    "the ( formal ) limit @xmath689 with @xmath690 ( @xmath145 fixed ) in the main theorem of  1 is @xmath691 the consequence is that the vertically symmetric poisson process has the same fluctuation as the usual poisson process with no symmetry condition .",
    "also the scaling in the above result is consistent with this intuition .",
    "there are poisson points of rate @xmath692 ( double of @xmath685 ) in the square of sides 2 and 1 .",
    "for such the case the limit ( [ symmetryfluc ] ) is also valid for the case of no symmetry condition .",
