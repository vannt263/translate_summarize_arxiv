    "for a stochastic process , the first passage time ( fpt ) is defined as the time @xmath0 when the process , starting from a given point , reaches a predetermined level for the first time , and is a random variable @xcite .",
    "escape times from a random potential , intervals between neural spikes , and fatigue failure times of engineering structures are all examples of fpts , arising in physics @xcite , biology @xcite , and engineering @xcite , respectively .",
    "thus , knowledge of the fpt distribution , @xmath1 , is essential for the effective application of probabilistic analysis .",
    "( as a convention we use capital letters to denote random variables and lower case letters to denote their values . )",
    "unfortunately , only in very few cases does one have explicit analytical expressions for @xmath1 .",
    "one such case is the ordinary brownian motion , an example of ordinary diffusion , in which the fpt is described by the famous inverse gaussian law @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this work is the derivation of the exact solution of @xmath1 for a much broader class of stochastic processes , namely , the levy type of anomalous diffusion @xcite in which the mean square displacement of the diffusive variable @xmath2 scales with time as @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , using a recently formulated framework of fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe ) @xcite , we express @xmath1 in terms of fox or h - functions @xcite , which is shown to contain the inverse gaussian distribution as a special case .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath5 , @xmath1 scales with @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "our next result concerns the comparison with a different type of anomalous diffusion , represented by fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite , where again @xmath3 with @xmath4 . for this type",
    ", we argue that @xmath7 for large @xmath5 , a result that has been conjectured earlier @xcite . finally , we present numerical simulations which verify the analytical results .",
    "the levy type of anomalous diffusion considered in this work is a class of non gaussian and non markovian processes founded on the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) where the waiting time obeys certain power law distribution @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the joint probability density between the waiting time @xmath9 and the jump size @xmath10 .",
    "it can be shown that , depending on the specific form of @xmath8 , the ctrw can produce both subdiffusive ( @xmath11 ) and superdiffusive processes ( @xmath12 ) as well as ordinary diffusion ( @xmath13 ) @xcite . for example , consider @xmath14 \\frac{(\\alpha-1)/\\tau}{(1+u/\\tau)^{\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath9 are decoupled with @xmath10 being a gaussian variable .",
    "( we note that , strictly speaking , the distribution of @xmath9 is not a levy stable distribution , but belongs to the domain of attraction @xcite of a one - sided stable levy law .",
    "we call @xmath9 a `` levy type of variable '' for want of a better name . ) for @xmath15 , the corresponding ctrw is characterized by a subdiffusive process with @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 , one gets ordinary diffusion with @xmath13 . if , on the other hand , @xmath10 and @xmath9 are coupled through @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the dirac delta function , the ctrw describes a superdiffusive process with @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the probability density function for a ctrw @xmath2 with @xmath23 .",
    "consider the generalized diffusion limit where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are scaling parameters for the space and time variables .",
    "for the subdiffusive case , this means taking the limit @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 kept a constant , and for the superdiffusive process , this means taking the same limit with @xmath29 kept a constant . in this limit",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the evolution of @xmath22 is determined by the following ffpe @xcite : @xmath30 where the riemann - liouville fractional integral operator @xmath31 is defined as @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the gamma function @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath34 is the generalized diffusion constant defined in the above generalized diffusion limit . from eq .",
    "( [ ffpe ] ) it is easily shown that @xmath35 .    in the framework of the fokker - planck equation , the first passage time problem is defined in terms of having absorbing boundaries at @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the predetermined level of crossing , with the initial condition @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "an equivalent formulation , due to symmetry , is to solve eq .",
    "( [ ffpe ] ) with the following boundary and initial conditions : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath37 is the new starting point of the process , containing the initial concentration of the distribution .",
    "( this latter formulation makes the subsequent derivation less cumbersome . )",
    "once we solve for @xmath22 , the first passage time distribution @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath44    taking into account of the boundary and initial conditions we are led to the following expansion for @xmath22 @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 . to determine the unknown function @xmath47",
