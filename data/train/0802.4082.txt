    "among the wide range of known exact solutions to einstein s field equations ( the most comprehensive source is @xcite ) , there are some with particularly interesting symmetry properties . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on _ homogeneous spacetimes _ , which by definition admit a transitive group of motions ; a group of motions ( or _ isometry group _ ) is a continuous ( lie ) group of transformations preserving the metric of a given spacetime .",
    "its generators are the killing vector fields @xmath2 which satisfy ( _ _ ag)_ab=0(_a)_a;b+(_a)_b;a=0 .",
    "that a group acts transitively means that the orbits under the group action are equal to the manifold itself , i.e. for any two given points @xmath3 and @xmath4 there is a transformation which maps @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "if this transformation is unique , the action is said to be simply transitive , otherwise it is multiply transitive ; for a multiply transitive group action there exists for any given point a subgroup which leaves this point invariant , which is called the _ stabilizer subgroup _ ( or little group ) of that point .",
    "after choice of an  origin \" one may identify each spacetime point with all elements of @xmath5 that map the origin to this point .",
    "stabilizer groups of different points are different but isomorphic , and hence one can identify the homogeneous space with the coset @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the group of motions and @xmath7 the stabilizer .",
    "+ elementary examples are provided by @xmath8-spheres with isometry group @xmath9 and stabilizer @xmath10 , s^n so(n+1)/so(n ) , and by minkowski space @xmath11 ^n e(n-1,1)/so(n-1,1 ) , where @xmath12 is the poincar group . +",
    "the existence of such a transitive group of motions allows one to use group theoretic methods to analyse the structure of the manifold .",
    "+   + in the particularly simple case of a simply transitive group of motions , the stabilizers are trivial and hence there is a one - to - one correspondence between spacetime points and elements of the group of motions .",
    "therefore the spacetime is not only a manifold but also a lie group .",
    "one example , and in fact the only example among vacuum solutions without a cosmological constant , is provided by the petrov solution which will be analysed in this paper .",
    "+   + our motivation to study homogeneous spacetimes comes from the method of _ non - linear realisations _ , where one looks for a general prescription to write down an action on a spacetime , interpreted as a coset @xmath13 , that respects the given symmetry",
    ". it should be invariant under the action of a subgroup @xmath14 and transform in a `` covariant '' fashion under the action of @xmath5 .",
    "one usually starts by considering left - invariant one - forms on the group @xmath5 , then writes down an action from these and removes lagrange multipliers from the action .",
    "we will give examples for this method when it is discussed in section 3 .",
    "+ since one only needs to specify the groups @xmath5 and @xmath7 , the method promises to be very generally applicable and may be of interest in the development of theories beyond m - theory .",
    "+ the general theory of non - linear realisations applied to internal symmetries was introduced in @xcite .",
    "+   + we will present the petrov solution with a possible physical interpretation as the exterior solution of an infinite rigidly rotating cylinder in section 2 , and also a related vacuum solution with negative cosmological constant which we will refer to as the kaigorodov - ozsvth solution . for the latter we compute the stress - energy tensor of the boundary theory in the context of the ads / cft correspondence from an expansion near the conformal boundary . the starting point of the analysis in section 3 will be the isometry group of the petrov spacetime and its lie algebra .",
    "we will give a matrix representation of the group and the algebra and use it to construct left - invariant one - forms on the group .",
    "this gives the form of a general first - order action .",
    "eliminating the non - dynamical variable from this action will give a lagrangian of finsler type , although we can not give an explicit form .",
    "+ since the isometry group is the basic object of interest here , we will then look for extensions of the petrov solution by looking at _ deformations _ of the lie algebra in section 4 .",
    "one of these deformations leads to the killing algebra of the kaigorodov - ozsvth solution . when discussing non - linear realisations for this case we will eliminate the non - dynamical variable and give an explicit form for the resulting lagrangian which again is of finsler type",
    "+ the petrov solution contains closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) , and in the context of possible causality violation by ctcs a central question is whether these can be created by some process in a spacetime which did not exhibit ctcs initially .",
    "hawking formulated the chronology protection conjecture which asserts that the appearance of ctcs is forbidden by the laws of physics @xcite .",
    "we will analyse the possible appearance of ctcs by spinning up a rotating cylinder in section 5 .",
    "+ in a more detailed analysis of the physical properties of the petrov and kaigorodov - ozsvth solutions in section 6 , we will show that they are geodesically complete and we will obtain general statements about geodesics in these spacetimes .",
    "we calculate the holonomy groups of the spacetimes in section 7 .",
    "a few conclusions are given in section 8 .",
    "the petrov solution is introduced in @xcite in the following theorem : _ the only vacuum solution of einstein s equations admitting a simply - transitive four - dimensional maximal group of motions is given by _",
    "k^2 ds^2=dr^2+e^-2rdz^2+e^r(r(d^2-dt^2)-2rddt ) , [ petrov ] where @xmath15 is an arbitrary constant , which shall be set equal to one , and we have relabelled the coordinates compared to @xcite .",

    "these integral curves have the form x^a()=(r_0+,z_0e^,_0e^-+t_0e^-,-_0e^-+t_0e^- ) , where we label the coordinates by @xmath21 . +   + the metric components @xmath22 and @xmath23 become zero at certain values can be shifted by a coordinate transformation @xmath24 and hence have no coordinate - independent significance ] of @xmath25 , but as the determinant of the metric in ( [ petrov ] ) is always @xmath26 , it is possible to extend the coordinates to infinite ranges and the coordinates ( @xmath27 ) define a global chart . the manifold is also time - orientable , as the vector field @xmath28 defines a global arrow of time , though this amounts to @xmath29 being future- as well as past - directed at some points .",
    "+   + bonnor @xcite pointed out that the solution can be viewed as a special case of the exterior part of a lanczos - van stockum solution @xcite describing an infinite cylinder of rigidly rotating dust .",
