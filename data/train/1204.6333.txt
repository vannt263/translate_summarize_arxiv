    "the hints of a light higgs boson have never been so strong . on top of the indirect indications coming from the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) of lep",
    "we now have powerful direct constraints from the lhc searches of atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . as of today",
    ", a sm - like higgs boson is constrained in a very narrow interval around @xmath5  gev .",
    "gev , is not covered by the direct searches and could become available in the presence of new sizable contributions to the ewpt",
    ". however we will not consider this possibility in the following .",
    "] moreover , a promising excess has been found by both experiments at @xmath6  gev , a reasonable expectation is that this excess will be confirmed by the 2012 lhc data and the higgs will be finally discovered .",
    "very little can be said , on the contrary , about the _ nature _ of the higgs .",
    "minimality suggests that it should be an elementary weakly coupled particle , described by the higgs model up to very high energy scales .",
    "naturalness requires instead that a more complicated structure emerges around the tev .",
    "a natural higgs could still be elementary , if it is embedded in a supersymmetric framework , or it could be a _",
    "composite _ object , _",
    "i.e. _ the bound state of a new strong dynamics . in the latter case",
    "the hierarchy problem is solved by the finite size of the higgs , which screens the contributions to its mass from virtual quanta of short wavelength .",
    "a particularly plausible possibility is that the higgs is not a generic bound state of the strong dynamics , but rather a ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) associated to a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "this explains naturally why it is much lighter than the other , unobserved , strong sector resonances .",
    "the idea of a composite pngb higgs has been studied at length @xcite , and the following scenario has emerged . apart from the higgs , which is composite , all the other sm particles originate as _ elementary _ fields , external to the strong sector .",
    "the communication with the higgs and the strong dynamics , and thus the generation of masses after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , occurs through _ linear _ couplings of the elementary fields with suitable strong sector operators . at low energies , below the confinement scale ,",
    "the linear couplings become _ mixing terms _ among the elementary sm particles and some heavy composite resonance . the physical states after diagonalization possess a composite component , realizing the paradigm of `` partial compositeness '' @xcite .",
    "the simplest setup , which is almost universally adopted in the literature , is based on the @xmath7 symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "this delivers only one pngb higgs doublet and incorporates the custodial symmetry to protect @xmath8 from unacceptably large corrections .",
    "a possible model - building ambiguity comes from the choice of the @xmath9 representation of the fermionic operators that mix with the sm fermions and in particular with the third family @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the `` minimal '' scenario , often denoted as `` mchm5 '' in the literature , these operators are in the fundamental ( @xmath12 ) representation .",
    "other known possibilities are the @xmath13 ( mchm4 ) and the @xmath14 representations .",
    "even if in the present paper we will adopt the minimal scenario as a reference , our results have a more general valence and range of applicability .",
    "we will discuss in the conclusions the effect of changing the representations and of even more radical deformations .",
    "associated with the fermionic operators , massive colored fermionic resonances emerge from the strong sector .",
    "these are the so - called `` top partners '' and provide a very promising direct experimental manifestation of the composite higgs scenario at the lhc @xcite .",
    "indeed it has been noticed by many authors , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time , that in explicit concrete models these particles are anomalously light , much lighter than the other strong sector s resonances .",
    "concretely , one finds that the partners can easily be below @xmath15  tev , with an upper bound of around @xmath16  tev , while the typical strong sector s scale is above @xmath17  tev in order to satisfy the ewpt constraints .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite observed a certain correlation of the mass of the partners with the one of the higgs boson .    the first goal of our paper will be to show that the lightness of the top partners has a _ structural _ origin , rather than being a peculiarity of some explicit model .",
    "the point is that in the composite higgs scenario there is a tight relation among the top partners and the generation of the higgs potential .",
    "this leads to a _",
    "correlation among the mass of the partners and the one of the higgs boson . in order for the latter to be light as implied by the present data",
    ", we find that at least one of the top partners must be anomalously light . in section  [ sec : higgspartners ] we will describe this mechanism in detail by adopting a general description of the composite higgs scenario with partial compositeness developed in ref.s  @xcite .",
    "our results will thus have general validity and they will apply , in particular , to the 5d holographic models of ref.s  @xcite . for a quantitative confirmation of the effect we need to study a concrete realization of the composite higgs idea .",
    "the simplest possibility is to consider a `` discrete '' composite higgs model ( dchm ) like the one proposed by two of us in ref .",
    "the central observation behind the formulation of the dchm is that the potential of the composite higgs is saturated by the ir dynamics of the strong sector . indeed in the uv , above the mass of the resonances which corresponds to the confinement scale ,",
    "the higgs `` dissolves '' in its fundamental constituents and the contributions to the potential get screened , as mentioned above .",
    "the same screening must take place in the low energy effective description of the theory and therefore the dynamics of the resonances must be such to give a _",
    "finite _ and _ calculable _ ( _ i.e. _ , ir - saturated ) higgs potential .",
    "this is indeed what happens in the 5d holographic models thanks to the collective effect of the entire kaluza - klein tower . in the dchm",
    "instead this is achieved by introducing a finite number of resonances and of extra symmetries which realize a `` collective breaking '' @xcite protection of the higgs potential .",
    "further elaborations based on this philosophy can be found in ref .",
    "other models similar to the dchm have been proposed in the context of little - higgs theories @xcite .    in sections  3 and 4",
    "we describe in detail the structure of the top partners in the dchm , and derive analytic explicit formulas that show quantitatively the correlation with the higgs mass .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the study of the 3-site dchm , which provides a genuinely complete theory of composite higgs . in this model ,",
    "two layers of fermionic resonances are introduced and the higgs potential is completely finite . in section  4",
    "we consider instead a simpler but less complete model , the two - site dchm . in this case one",
    "has a single layer of resonances and quite a small number ( @xmath17 , after fixing the top mass ) of parameter describing the top partners .",
    "however the potential is _ not _ completely calculable , being affected by a logarithmic divergence at one loop @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it turns out that the divergence corresponds to a _",
    "unique _ operator in the potential and therefore it can be canceled by renormalizing only one parameter which we can chose to be the higgs vev @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the higgs mass _ is _ calculable also in the dchm@xmath19 , this model can therefore be considered as the `` simplest '' composite higgs model and it can be used to study the phenomenology of the top partners in correlation with the higgs mass .",
    "the analytic results are further supported by scatter plots , in which we scan all the available parameter space of the model .",
    "the results are quite remarkable : in the plane of the masses of the top partners the points with light enough higgs boson fall very sharply in the region of light partners .",
    "notice that the actual values of the partner s mass is _ not _ fixed by our argument , it still depends on the overall mass scale of the strong sector .",
    "however this scale can only be raised at the price of fine - tuning the parameter @xmath20 ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to very small values .",
    "reasonable values of @xmath21 , below which the entire scenario starts becoming unplausible , are @xmath22 or @xmath23 . for @xmath22",
    "we find that the partners are _ always _ below @xmath15  tev while for @xmath23 the absolute maximum is around @xmath16  tev .",
    "we therefore expect that the @xmath24-tev lhc will have enough sensitivity to explore the parameter space of the model completely .",
    "non - trivial constraints can however already be obtained by the presently available exclusions from the @xmath0-tev data , as we will discuss in section  5 .",
    "the main effect comes from the exclusion of the 5/3-charged partner decaying to @xmath25 .",
    "no dedicated lhc search is available for this particle , however we find that it is possible to apply the bound of @xmath2  gev coming from the cms search of bottom - like heavy quarks in same - sign dileptons @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the other partners are considerably reduced by the branching fractions to the individual decay channels assumed in the searches .",
    "we therefore expect that a significant improvement of the bounds could be obtained within some explicit model by combining the different channels .",
    "the @xmath26-site dchm is definitely the best candidate , one might easily perform a complete scan of its @xmath17 free parameters .",
    "we have already implemented the @xmath26-site dchm ( and also of the @xmath17-site one ) in madgraph 5 @xcite for the required simulations .",
    "finally , in section  6 we present our conclusion and an outlook of the possible implication of our results .",
    "in particular we discuss how our analysis could be adapted to more general scenarios of composite higgs and we suggest some directions for future work .",
    "if the higgs is a pngb its potential , and in particular its mass @xmath27 , can only be generated through the breaking of the goldstone symmetry .",
    "one unavoidable , sizable source of goldstone symmetry breaking is the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath28 .",
    "thus it is very reasonable to expect a tight relation among the higgs mass and the fermionic sector of the theory which is responsible for the generation of @xmath28 .",
    "this is particularly true in the canonical scenario of composite higgs , summarized in the introduction , where the _ only _ sizable contribution to the higgs potential comes from the top sector . in more general cases",
    "there might be additional terms , coming for instance from extra sources of symmetry breaking not associated with the sm fermions and gauge fields @xcite .",
    "barring fine - tuning , the latter contributions can however at most _ enhance _",
    "@xmath27 , the ones from the top therefore provide a robust _ lower bound _ on the higgs mass .",
    "if the higgs has to be light , as it seems to be preferred by the present data , the top sector contribution must therefore be kept small enough by some mechanism . in the minimal scenario , as we will describe below , this is achieved by making anomalously light ( and thus more easily detectable ) some of the exotic states in the top sector .    in order to understand this mechanism",
    "we obviously need to specify in some detail the structure of the theory which controls the generation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , the paradigm adopted in the minimal model is the one of partial compositeness , in which the elementary left- and right - handed top fields are mixed with heavy vector - like colored particles , the so - called top partners .",
    "after diagonalization the physical top becomes an admixture of elementary and composite states and interacts with the strong sector , and in particular with the higgs , through its composite component .",
    "the yukawa coupling gets therefore generated and it is proportional to the sine of the mixing angles @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant lagrangian , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , has the structure @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the higgs field ( before ewsb , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 ) and we have employed the decay constant @xmath33 of the goldstone boson higgs for the normalization of the elementary  composite mixings .",
    "after diagonalization , neglecting ewsb , the top yukawa reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the physical masses of the top partners .",
    "the essential point of making the partners light is that this allows to _ decrease _ the elementary  composite mixings @xmath36 while keeping @xmath28 fixed to the experimental value .",
    "let us consider the case of comparable left- and right - handed mixings , @xmath37 .",
    "this condition , as explained in the following ( see also @xcite ) , is enforced in the minimal model by the requirement of a realistic ewsb .",
    "we can also assume that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while potentially small , are still larger than @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the critical value after which eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) saturates and there is no advantage in further decreasing the masses . under these conditions eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) gives @xmath42 which shows how @xmath43 decreases _ linearly _ with the mass of each partner .",
    "the mixings ensure the communication among the strong sector , which is invariant under the goldstone symmetry , and the elementary sector which is not .",
    "therefore they break the symmetry and allow for the generation of the higgs mass .",
    "it is thus intuitive that a reduction of their value , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for light top partners , will lead to a decrease of @xmath27 . to be quantitative ,",
    "let us anticipate the result of the following section ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath27 can be estimated as @xmath44 where @xmath45 gev is the higgs vev .",
    "this gives , making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath46 the above equation already shows the correlation among the higgs and the top partner mass .",
    "of course we still need to justify eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and for this we need the more detailed analysis of the following section .",
    "there is however one important aspect which is _ not _ captured by this general discussion .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) that making both @xmath47 and @xmath48 small at the same time produces a _",
    "quadratic _ decrease of @xmath43 and thus of @xmath27 .",
    "however this behavior is never found in the explicit models we will investigate in the following sections , the effect is always _ linear_.",
    "the basic reason is that , due to the goldstone nature of the higgs , the coupling @xmath49 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) depends itself on the partners mass .",
    "indeed all the interactions of a pngb higgs are controlled by the dimensional coupling @xmath33 and no independent yukawa - like coupling @xmath49 can emerge . by dimensional analysis on",
    "has @xmath50 or more precisely , as we will also verify below , @xmath51 . thus if both masses become small one power of @xmath52 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) is compensated by @xmath49 and the effect remains linear .      for a better understanding",
    "we need a slightly more careful description of our theory .",
    "in particular we must take into account the goldstone boson nature of the higgs which is instead hidden in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite adopted in the previous discussion .",
    "following ref.s  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we describe the higgs as a pngb associated with the @xmath53 spontaneous breaking which takes place in the strong sector . we parametrize ( see @xcite for the conventions ) the goldstone boson matrix as @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the broken generators and @xmath56 the @xmath57 real higgs components .",
    "the goldstone matrix transforms under @xmath58 as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath31 is a non - linear representation of @xmath9 which however only lives in @xmath60 . with our choice of the generators @xmath31 is block - diagonal @xmath61 with @xmath62",
    "the sm fermions , and in particular the third family quarks @xmath63 and @xmath11 , are introduced as elementary fields and they are coupled linearly to the strong sector . in the uv , where @xmath9 is restored",
    ", we can imagine that the elementary  composite interactions take the form @xmath64 where the chiral fermionic operators @xmath65 transform in a _ linear _ representation of @xmath9 .",
    "as dimensionless couplings , for shortness we have reabsorbed in @xmath65 the powers of the uv scale needed to restore the correct energy dimensions . ] in particular in the minimal model we take both @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the fundamental , @xmath68 .",
    "the tensors @xmath69 are uniquely fixed by the need of respecting the sm @xmath70 group embedded in @xmath9 global factor is needed . in order to reproduce the correct sm hypercharges one must indeed define @xmath71 and assign @xmath72 @xmath73 charge to both @xmath66 and @xmath67.[foot ] ] @xmath74 let us also define , for future use , the embedding in the @xmath68 of @xmath10 and of @xmath11 @xmath75    the elementary ",
    "composite couplings obviously break the goldstone symmetry @xmath9 .",
    "however provided the breaking is small we can still obtain valuable information from the @xmath9 invariance by the method of spurions .",
    "the point is that the theory , including the uv mixings in eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) , is perfectly invariant if we transform not just the strong sector fields and operators but also the tensors @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this invariance survives in the ir description , the effective operators must therefore respect @xmath9 if we treat @xmath76 and @xmath77 as spurions which transform , formally , in the @xmath68 of @xmath9 . to be precise",
    "there are further symmetries one should take into account .",
    "these are the `` elementary '' @xmath78 and @xmath79 , under which the strong sector is invariant and only the elementary fermions and the spurions transform .",
    "certain linear combinations of the elementary group generators with the @xmath9 ( and @xmath73 , see footnote  [ foot ] ) ones correspond to the sm group , these are of course preserved by the mixings .",
    "let us first discuss the implications of the spurionic analysis on the structure of the higgs potential .",
    "we must classify the non - derivative invariant operators involving the higgs and the spurions .",
    "notice that the invariance under @xmath80 requires that the spurions only appear in the following two combinations @xmath81 the higgs enters instead through the goldstone matrix @xmath82 .",
    "notice that to build @xmath9 invariants we must contract the indices of @xmath83 with the _ first _ index of the matrix @xmath82 , and not with the second one .",
    "indeed if we rewrite more explicitly equation ( [ utrasf ] ) as @xmath84 we see that while the first index transforms with @xmath85 like the spurion indices do , the second one transforms differently , with @xmath31 .",
    "remember that @xmath31 is block - diagonal ( see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) ) , thus to respect the symmetry we just need to form @xmath60 ( rather than @xmath9 ) invariants with the `` barred '' indices , in practice we can split them in fourplet and singlet components as @xmath86 .    with these tools",
    "it is straightforward to classify all the possible invariants at a given order in the spurions . at the quadratic order , up to irrelevant additive constants , only two independent operators exist @xmath87 where we plugged in the explicit value of the spurions in eq .",
    "( [ spu ] ) and of the goldstone matrix in eq .",
    "( [ go ] ) taking the higgs along its vev @xmath88 . at this order then the potential",
    "can only be formed by two operators , with unknown coefficients which would become calculable only within an explicit model .",
    "we can nevertheless estimate their expected size .",
    "following @xcite we obtain @xmath89\\,=\\,\\frac{n_cm_*^4}{16\\pi^2g_*^2}\\left[\\frac12 c_ly_l^2-c_ry_r^2\\right]\\sin^2(h / f_\\pi)\\,+\\,{\\textrm{const.}}\\ , , \\label{pot2}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 are order one parameters and @xmath91 are the typical masses and couplings of the strong sector , @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 .",
    "remember that what we are discussing is the fermionic contribution to the potential , generated by colored fermion loops , this is the origin of the @xmath94 qcd color factor in eq .",
    "( [ pot2 ] ) . also , this implies that the scale @xmath95 is the one of the fermionic resonances , which could be a priori different from the mass of the vectors @xmath96 .",
    "is the scale at which the potential is saturated and generically it _ is not _ associated to the masses @xmath52 of the anomalously light partner . due to additional structures , and only in the case in which _ both _ @xmath97 and @xmath98 are anomalously light , one might obtain @xmath99 in some explicit model because the light degrees of freedom reconstruct the structure of a @xmath26-site dchm in which the quadratic divergence is canceled . ]    the spurionic analysis has strongly constrained the higgs potential at the quadratic order .",
    "the two independent operators have indeed the same functional dependence on the higgs and the potential is entirely proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "but then the potential at this order can not lead to a realistic ewsb , the minimum is either at @xmath101 or at @xmath102 .",
    "we would instead need to adjust the minimum in order to have @xmath103 , and to achieve this additional contributions are required . in the minimal scenario these are provided by higher order terms in the spurion expansion .",
    "the classification of the operators is straightforwardly extended to the quartic order , one finds a second allowed functional dependence could appear .",
    "this is however forbidden by the parity in @xmath104 , @xmath105 , for this reason it is not present in the minimal models . ]",
    "@xmath106\\ , , \\label{potfin}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 collectively denotes the quartic terms @xmath108 , @xmath109 or @xmath110 and @xmath111 are coefficients of order unity .",
    "notice that , differently from the quadratic one , the quartic potential does not depend strongly on the fermionic scale @xmath95 . since @xmath112 the prefactor of @xmath113 can indeed be rewritten as @xmath114 .",
    "a priori , @xmath113 should give a negligible contribution to the potential because it is suppressed with respect to @xmath115 by a factor @xmath116 , which is small in the minimal scenario .",
    "to achieve realistic ewsb however we need to tune the coefficients of the @xmath100 and @xmath117 terms in such a way as to cancel the higgs mass term obtaining @xmath118 . in formulas",
    ", we have @xmath119 but , to make @xmath120 , we need to cancel @xmath115 , which only contributes to @xmath121 and not to @xmath122 , and to make it comparable with @xmath113 .",
    "this requires @xmath37 or , more precisely @xmath123 on top of this preliminary cancellation the tuning of the higgs vev in eq .",
    "( [ tun0 ] ) must be carried on .",
    "the total amount of fine - tuning is of order @xmath124 and it is worse than the naive estimate by the factor @xmath125 .. for small values of @xmath92 , however , all the fermionic resonaces become lighter and this could give rise to enhanced corrections to the electroweak parameters in contrast with the ewpt",
    ". it could however be interesting to study this case explicitly in a concrete model . ]    the final outcome of this discussion is that achieving realistic ewsb requires that the quadratic potential is artificially reduced and made comparable with @xmath113 .",
    "therefore we can simply forget about @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ pot2 ] ) and use instead eq .",
    "( [ potfin ] ) as an estimate of the total higgs potential .",
    "in particular we can estimate the physical higgs mass , which is given by @xmath126 where we used @xmath93 .",
    "expanding for @xmath127 we recover the result anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we would have reached very similar conclusions if we had considered fermionic operators in the @xmath128 of @xmath9 rather than in the @xmath68 . as shown in the original paper on the minimal composite higgs @xcite ,",
    "also in that case the potential is the sum of two trigonometric functions with coefficients @xmath121 and @xmath122 that scale respectively as @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the condition to obtain a realistic ewsb is again @xmath120 , _",
    "i.e. _ eq .  ( [ rel ] ) , therefore the higgs mass - term scales like @xmath107 as in eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) . since the scaling is the same , all the conclusions drawn in this section , in particular the main result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhgen ] ) , will hold in exactly the same way .",
    "moreover it is possible to show that the same structure of the potential emerges in the case of the @xmath14 of @xmath9 so that our results will apply also to the latter case .",
    "possible ways to evade the light higgs - light partner correlation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhgen ] ) will be discussed in the conclusions .      for a quantitative estimate of @xmath27 , which will show the correlation with the top partners mass , we need an estimate of @xmath131 .",
    "the mixings @xmath132 control the generation of the top quark yukawa , which of course must be fixed to the experimental value .",
    "the size of @xmath131 however is not uniquely fixed because @xmath28 also depends on the masses of the top partners with which the elementary @xmath133 and @xmath11 fields mix .",
    "in particular , as explained previously ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) ) , the top yukawa would get _ enhanced _ in the presence of anomalously light partners . to compensate for this , while keeping @xmath28 fixed , one has to _ decrease _ @xmath131 , thus lowering the higgs mass .",
    "we can study this effect in detail by writing down the low energy effective lagrangian for the top partners .",
    "since the operators @xmath65 are in the @xmath12 of @xmath9 , which decomposes as @xmath134 under @xmath60 , the top partners which appear in the low energy theory will be in the fourplet and in the singlet .",

    "the singlet @xmath138 is obviously invariant . for our discussion",

    "( [ yyt ] ) , @xmath166 . by setting @xmath167 one obtains again eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhgen ] ) . in conclusion , while the final formula is the same of ref .",
    "@xcite , the derivation of the present section shows that it has a rather different physical origin .      before concluding this section we notice that the lagrangian ( [ lagt ] ) is significantly more general than the one we will actually encounter in the specific models . first of all",

    "one implication of the parity symmetry is that the two coefficients of the quadratic potential ( [ pot2 ] ) have to be equal , @xmath172 , and thus the relation among the @xmath173 and @xmath174 mixings ( [ rel ] ) becomes simply @xmath175 . for what concerns instead the partners lagrangian ( [ lagt ] )",
    "parity implies @xmath176 and @xmath177",
    ".    moreover , the additional symmetry structures which underly the formulation of our models require the relations @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the reason will become more clear in the following section , the basic point is that in our construction the fourplet and singlet form a fiveplet under an additional @xmath9 group which is respected by the mixings .    to make contact with our models ,",
    "let us then choose @xmath178 , the top mass becomes @xmath179 and it is proportional to the mass - difference @xmath180 .",
    "indeed for @xmath181 the mixings are proportional to the five - plet @xmath182 defined as @xmath183 which is related to the original fields by the orthogonal matrix @xmath82 .",
    "it becomes therefore convenient to perform a field redefinition and to re - express the lagrangian in terms of @xmath182 , in this way the mixings become trivial and independent of the higgs field and the only operators which contain the higgs boson and no derivatives originate from the rotation of the mass terms .",
    "therefore these operators are proportional to the mass difference @xmath184 because for @xmath185 also the mass lagrangian becomes @xmath9 invariant and the dependence on the higgs drops .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath186 from which eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) is immediately rederived .",
    "the first explicit model we will consider for our analysis is the @xmath17-site discrete composite higgs model ( dchm@xmath188 )  @xcite . this model provides a simple but complete four - dimensional realization of the composite higgs paradigm . as we already mentioned in the introduction , an important , distinctive property of the dchm@xmath188 model is the finiteness and calculability of the higgs potential .",
    "this feature , together with the _ simplicity _ of the dchm approach , will enable us to derive explicit formulas displaying the relation between the higgs mass and the spectrum of the top partners .",
    "another important aspect is the fact that the parametrization which we naturally get in the discrete composite higgs framework can be directly mapped onto the general structure of partial compositeness . as we already showed in the previous section",
    "partial compositeness plays a crucial role in understanding the relation between the properties of the higgs boson and the spectum of the fermionic resonances",
    ". we will confirm this in the explicit analysis we will present in this section .",
    "the basic structure of the dchm@xmath188 model consists of two replicas of the non - linear @xmath189-model .",
    "the symmetry structure can be directly connected to a three - site pattern , as schematically shown in figure  [ fig:3-site ] , where each @xmath189-model , whose degrees of freedom are denoted by @xmath190 , is represented by a link connecting two sites . in this way",
    "we can relate each site to a corresponding subgroup of the global invariance of the model . in order to accommodate the hypercharges of the fermionic sector",
    ", an extra @xmath191 global factor must be introduced . for simplicity , we do not associate this abelian factor to any of the sites and let it act on all the fermions of the model .",
    "the elementary gauge fields , as well as the vector resonances coming from the composite sector , are introduced by gauging suitable subgroups of the total global invariance @xmath192 .",
    "the elementary fields correspond to the gauging of an @xmath193 subgroup of @xmath194 , with the identification of the hypercharge @xmath195 .",
    "two levels of composite resonances are introduced by gauging at the middle and last site . at the middle site we gauge the diagonal subgroup @xmath196 of the global invariance @xmath197 . at the last site we gauge only an @xmath198 subgroup of the @xmath199 global invariance .",
    "the model encodes , through the explicit breaking induced by the gauging at the last site , the spontaneous @xmath200 global symmetry breaking pattern of the strong sector .",
    "a useful form of the lagrangian , which is suitable for the computation of the spectrum and of the higgs potential , is obtained by adopting the `` holographic '' gauge . in this gauge ,",
    "the only dependence on the goldstone degrees of freedom appears at the first site , where the elementary fields live , while the lagrangian of the composite sector assumes a particularly simple form .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the holographic gauge can be reached by gauge transformations at the middle and last site which set @xmath201 equal to the identity and remove the unphysical degrees of freedom from @xmath202 .",
    "after the transformation @xmath202 becomes the goldstone matrix @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ go ] ) .",
    "the fermionic sector of the model contains the elementary fields corresponding to the sm chiral fermions and two sets of composite resonances . for simplicity we will only focus on the third quark generation and in particular on the fields related to the top quark , and we will neglect the light generations , the right - handed bottom field @xmath203 and the corresponding composite partners .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that the contribution of the latter to the higgs effective potential is parametrically suppressed by the small bottom mass with respect to the one coming from the top tower .    in analogy with the gauge sector ,",

    "of course , the bound has a greater impact on the configurations with larger @xmath21 , which predict lighter resonances . nevertheless even in the case of a relatively small @xmath244 , namely @xmath266 ,",
    "the exclusion bound on the exotic resonance puts non - trivial constraints .",
    "the situation is different for the cases in which the lightest new state is the singlet @xmath215 .",
    "the bounds obtained in our analysis can only exlude a limited number of configurations at @xmath21 relatively large .",
    "in particular for @xmath265 realistic configurations start to be excluded only in the asymptotic region with a light @xmath215 . on the other hand , for @xmath266",
    "the mass of the @xmath215 resonances is always above the current bounds .",
    "in this paper we explored the relation which , in a broad class of composite higgs models , links a light higgs boson to the presence of light resonances coming from the new strong sector of the theory .",
    "the class of models we focused on are the ones based on the symmetry pattern @xmath371 and in which the fermionic resonances come in the fundamental representation of @xmath372 . as a first step",
    ", we analyzed from a general point of view the mechanism which generates the correlation of the higgs mass with the top partners .",
    "we found that the connection has a simple qualitative explanation in terms of the structure of partial fermion compositeness which is realized in the composite higgs scenario .",
    "the point is that the presence of light partners would tend to increase the fraction of top quark compositeness , thus increasing its mass . keeping the latter fixed requires that the elementary  composite mixings , must be decreased in order to compensate .",
    "but the mixings also control the higgs potential , and their decrease lowers the the higgs quartic coupling and consequently the higgs mass .    through a detailed analysis performed in a general effective parametrization of the composite higgs set - up , we found that the higgs mass scales linearly with the mass of the lightest partner .",
    "this model - independent result is encoded in the simple relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhgen ] ) .",
    "the relevant partners are those which are most strongly mixed with the elementary @xmath133 and @xmath11 , namely the @xmath97 and the @xmath215 resonances .    from a quantitative point of view , assuming only a moderate degree of tuning between the higgs vev and the goldstone decay constant @xmath33",
    ", we found that a higgs mass in the current lhc preferred region @xmath373 requires at least one top partner with a mass of the order or below the @xmath374 .",
    "this result strengthens the common assertion that light top partners are an essential feature of the composite higgs scenario .",
    "moreover it shows that the lightest of such states are well within the reach of the lhc and they constitute one of the most important probes of the composite higgs paradigm .    to confirm the validity of our general results we analyzed in detail the relation between the higgs and the resonance masses in two explicit models .",
    "the first model we considered is the three - site discrete composite higgs model , which gives a simple but complete realization of the composite higgs framework .",
    "good agreement with the general result is found ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhmt ] ) ) .",
    "the study of this explicit model allowed us to quantify the effects of the higher levels of resonances coming from the composite sector .",
    "their contribution has been determined analytically ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : exact_b ] ) ) and checked numerically by a scan on the parameter space of the model ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : mbid_msing_dchm3 ] and [ fig : mex_msing_dchm3 ] ) .",
    "we found that in the asymptotic regions in which there is a large mass hierarchy between the resonances of the first level , the effect of the heavier states is very small . on the contrary ,",
    "when the masses are comparable the corrections can be sizable and can affect the higgs mass by as much as @xmath255 .",
    "these corrections , however , do not spoil the agreement with the qualitative picture obtained by the general analysis .    as a second explicit model , we considered an even simpler and more minimal implementation of the composite higgs idea , the two - site discrete composite higgs model .",
    "this model contains only one level of composite resonances , thus it only retains the amount of information relevant for the present collider experiments .",
    "the price we have to pay in adopting this minimal description is a partial loss of predictivity : in the two - site model the higgs potential is no more finite at one loop .",
    "nevertheless only one counterterm is needed to regulate the divergence , thus one condition is enough to fix the renormalization ambiguity .",
    "we can therefore chose the value of @xmath244 as a renormalization condition and retain the higgs mass as a _ calculable _ quantity .",
    "we also showed how the effect of the higher resonance levels on the higgs potential can be efficiently modeled by introducing a suitable extra contribution . with this modification ,",
    "the spectrum of the top partners in correlation with the higgs mass is completely analogous to the one found in the three - site case .",
    "generically , our result should apply to any explicit realization of the composite higgs idea , and in particular to the popular 5d holographic models .",
    "this is partially confirmed by the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which indeed show an approximately linear correlation between the mass of the higgs and the one of the lightest @xmath97 state . from what can be seen in the plots ,",
    "moreover , the agreement with our general formula seems good also at a quantitative level . it might be worth checking the agreement in more detail .",
    "another aspect which could be worth investigating is how much our results depend on the choice of the fermion representations . in the set - ups considered so far in the literature , in which the fermions are in the spinorial or in the adjoint representation of @xmath372",
    "there will be no qualitative difference with respect to the case of the fundamental we have considered in the present paper .",
    "the general analysis of section  2 will apply in the same way because also in these alternative scenarios only one invariant operator contributes to the higgs potential at the leading order in the elementary  composite mixing .",
    "this implies that the leading order must be canceled and the higgs mass squared scales as @xmath107 ( rather than @xmath43 ) like in eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) .",
    "also the estimate of the top mass will remain the same and therefore the final result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhgen ] ) will be parametrically unchanged . at the quantitative level , however , the relation among the higgs and the resonance masses could be modified at order one , due to possibly different group theory factors .",
    "it would be interesting to assess this point .    with other choices of the fermion representations , in which two or more invariants",
    "appear at order @xmath43 , our conclusions could instead change qualitatively . a model of this kind",
    "could for instance be obtained by embedding the fermions in the adjoint but relaxing the requirement of left ",
    "right symmetry , coupling , which could invalidate the model or lead to additional tuning . ] or by considering higher and possibly reducible representations .",
    "the models with more invariants are particularly interesting because they do not suffer of the enhanced ( or `` double '' ) tuning which we described in section  2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ tunn ] ) ) .",
    "this indeed originates only in the case of a single invariant because of the `` preliminary '' cancellation of the @xmath242 term which is needed to make it of the same order of the subleading @xmath375 contributions .",
    "models in which the double tuning is not present , however , should face another possible problem .",
    "given that the potential , including the quartic higgs coupling , now arises at @xmath242 , the mass of the higgs is expected to be a factor @xmath376 _ larger _ than in the models with the preliminary cancellation .",
    "the situation would therefore be worse than the one considered in the present paper , so we expect that either we will find a too large higgs mass or too light top partners .",
    "the last step of our work has been to derive some non trivial constraints on the resonance masses from the current lhc data .",
    "we performed a simple analysis in which only the lightest resonances have been considered and the contributions from heavier states have been altogether neglected .",
    "the lightest composite states are either the exotic partner of charge @xmath1 , the @xmath232 , or the @xmath281 singlet top - like state @xmath215 .",
    "no dedicated lhc analysis exists for states of charge @xmath1 , however the existing searches for pair - produced new bottom - like quarks can be used to derive some exclusion bounds also for the exotic resonance .",
    "our simulations show that the current exclusion can be translated into a bound @xmath350 .",
    "this bound is already enough to exclude a non - negligible portion of the configurations with a realistic higgs mass .",
    "the situation is different for the cases in which the lightest state is the @xmath215 .",
    "lhc searches for pair - produced charge @xmath72 resonances are available , however the bounds given in the experimental analyses can not be naively applied to the composite models , due to the fact that @xmath351 branching ratios to specific channels are assumed .",
    "taking into account the branching ratios predicted by our explicit models , a lower bound @xmath370 is obtained .",
    "this bound is still too weak to put significant constraints on the model .",
    "however it is not far from the masses obtained in realistic configurations and can already exclude a small region of the parameter space in the case @xmath265 .",
    "the simple analysis we used to derive the exclusion bounds leads to some robust and conservative constraints on the masses of the composite resonances .",
    "the assumption of having only one relevant light state and to consider only pair production is however a drastic simplification which often neglects important contributions .",
    "in particular some of the heavier states can be close enough to the lightest resonance to give a sizable contribution to the relevant search channels .",
    "moreover single production processes can be relevant in specific regions of the parameter space .",
    "it is plausible that the inclusion of these effects could considerably strengthen the bounds we derived in this paper .",
    "a complete study of the exclusion bound , including the effects of the heavier resonances and of single production , is not completely straightforward .",
    "an analysis of this kind should take into account possible decay chains from the heavier resonances as well as non - universal production cross sections due to single production channels . to perform this task",
    "it seems unavoidable to employ a concrete model .",
    "we already produced complete madgraph 5 cards implementing the two - site and the three - site models .",
    "in particular the two - site model contains only three free parameters and one could imagine performing a complete scan .",
    "these cards were used in the present paper to adapt the experimental analysis and derive the bounds on the exotic state @xmath232 .",
    "we leave for future work the complete study of the constraints coming from the experimental data .",
