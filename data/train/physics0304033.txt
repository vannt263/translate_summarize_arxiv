    "nowadays the production of high - brightness electron bunches constitutes one of the most challenging and interesting activities for particle accelerator physicists .",
    "the growing interest of the community in this kind of beams is justified by important applications such as self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase)-free - electron - lasers operating in the x - ray region ( see , amongst others , @xcite ) .",
    "similar bunches are also being considered for production of femtosecond radiation pulses by simpler schemes based on cherenkov and transition radiation @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges faced by physicists involved in this area is constituted by the presence of self - field induced collective effects .",
    "these effects may spoil the brightness of the electron beam .",
    "self - fields obey the usual linard - wiechert expressions ; the fields generated whenever an electron bunch undergoes a motion under the influence of external forces are different from the usual space - charge self - interaction , and are usually neglected in cases in which one does not deal with high - brightness beams .",
    "the equations for the field form , together with the dynamical equations for the particle motion , a formidable self - consistent problem .",
    "its complete solution , that is the particle evolution , is obtained only when one is able to solve simultaneously the equations for the fields ( electrodynamical problem ) and the equations of motion ( dynamical problem ) : this task can be performed with the help of self - consistent computer simulations .",
    "an example of such codes is given ( see @xcite ) by the program @xmath4 , which will be used throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath4 has been used to predict self - field related effects in the bunch compressor chicane to be used before the main linac for the xfel at desy and it is , at the time being , the only fully developed code used for xfel modelling both at desy and slac .",
    "results show that the projected transverse emittance of the bunch grows from @xmath5 after the injection to the significantly enhanced value of @xmath6 after the compressor @xcite .",
    "transverse dynamics is addressed by the code in two steps : first , the transverse electromagnetic forces , which are well defined and measurable physical quantities , are calculated separately and , second , the equation of motion is solved in a self - consistent way .    from this viewpoint",
    "a thorough understanding of transverse electromagnetic forces by themselves is of paramount importance since it allows to gain confidence in full simulation results .",
    "the behavior of these forces can be obtained numerically by using the electromagnetic solver of the code for a given source distribution evolving rigidly along a certain trajectory ( i.e. a zero energy spread is assumed throughout the bunch evolution ) , but numerical results alone are not sufficient in order to reach a full understanding of how electromagnetic forces act .",
    "consider for example the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , obtained by using the electromagnetic solver of @xmath0 .",
    "radial force normalized to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , felt by a particle with different vertical displacements @xmath9 positioned at the center of a line bunch @xmath10 long as the bunch enters a circle of radius @xmath11 . here",
    "these simulations were obtained by means of the code @xmath0.,width=340 ]    the figure shows the normalized radial force ( i.e. the force normalized to @xmath13 in the direction orthogonal to the test particle velocity and still lying on the bending plane ) felt by a test particle . here",
    "@xmath14 is the bunch density while @xmath9 is the vertical ( orthogonal to the bending plane ) displacement with respect to the center of a one - dimensional bunch with rectangular density distribution function .",
    "the plot shows interesting characteristics : a very sharp feature at the injection position , a transient and a steady state , which we can observe but for which there is no intuitive physical explanation .",
    "the electromagnetic problem is , of course , only a part of the formidable evolution problem but its understanding is @xmath15 an important physical issue .",
    "analytical investigations of this simplified , although very important situation are therefore needed in order to see the meaning of the simulation results , besides providing , from a more practical viewpoint , important cross - checks .",
    "we will show that through this kind of study we can understand the features of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] from a physical viewpoint , deal with characteristic times and lengths and , as a very practical result , validate the simulation results by producing analytical cross - checks .    the self - interaction in the longitudinal direction ( parallel , at any time , to the velocity vector by definition ) is responsible for the energy exchange between the system and the acceleration field and for all csr ( coherent synchrotron radiation)-related phenomena , which have been studied extensively elsewhere ( see , amongst others , @xcite ...",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "self - forces in the transverse direction were first addressed , in the case of a circular motion , and from an electrodynamical viewpoint , in @xcite . further analysis ( @xcite , @xcite ... @xcite ) considers , again , the case of circular motion both from an electrodynamical and a dynamical viewpoint .",
    "we proposed a fully electrodynamical analysis of a bunch moving in an arc of a circle in @xcite , where , for the reasons explained before , we were not interested in the full evolution problem .",
    "nevertheless , in that paper we addressed the issue of understanding the electromagnetic interactions only in the framework of a 1d model . before our study in @xcite",
    "there was no explanation for the simulation results shown in fig .",
    "the work in @xcite provided a qualitative explanation of these results : such qualitative character of the explanation is due to the fact that the model in @xcite is one - dimensional , and does not allow any quantitative investigation when ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) a vertical displacement is introduced .",
    "still it was possible to demonstrate that the sharp feature near the injection point is due to interactions of the test particle with particles in front of it , while the transient part is due to the interaction with particles behind it .",
    "in this paper we aim at an extension of the model proposed in @xcite which allows a fully electrodynamical analysis of a bunch endowed with a vertical dimension .",
    "since a bunch with vertical extent can be always thought of as a superposition of displaced charge lines , all the relevant physical aspects of the problem are included in the study of a simpler model , constituted by a one - dimensional line bunch and a test particle with vertical displacement , which is the situation studied in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this article ,",
    "our explanation of the features in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] will be eventually refined to a quantitative level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first treat , in section [ sec : two ] , the transverse interaction between two particles moving in an arc of a circle , supposing that one of the two particles has a vertical displacement @xmath9 with respect to the source . by integration of our results",
    "we consider , in section [ sec : transientbunch ] , a stepped - profile electron bunch interacting with a test particle with vertical displacement entering an arc of a circle and we discuss all the characteristic lengths involved . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we come to a summary of the results obtained and to conclusions .",
    "we will first address the case of two electrons moving in an arc of a circle of radius @xmath16 , in such a way that one of the two is displaced , with respect to the reference trajectory , by a quantity @xmath9 in the vertical ( perpendicular to the bending plane ) direction .",
    "we will see that , as concerns the interaction in the radial direction ( in the bending plane ) it does not matter which particle is endowed with this displacement .",
    "the electro - magnetic force which one of the two particles ( designated with `` t '' , i.e. the test particle ) feels , due to the interaction with the other one ( designated with `` s '' , i.e. the source particle ) , is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the position of the test particle , @xmath19 is the electron charge with its own ( negative ) sign , @xmath20 is the velocity of the test particle normalized to the speed of light , @xmath21 , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the electric and the magnetic field generated at a given time @xmath24 by the source particle s , at the position of the test particle t , namely    @xmath25 \\over{r_\\mathrm{st } \\left({1- { \\bf{\\hat n } } \\cdot { \\bm { \\beta_\\mathrm{s}}}}\\right)^{3 } } } \\biggr\\}~ & & \\label{efield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath26    here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the dimensionless velocity and its time derivative at the retarded time @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the distance between the retarded position of the source particle and the present position of the test electron , @xmath31 is a unit vector along the line connecting those two points and @xmath32 is the usual lorentz factor referred to the source particle at the retarded time @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to the case studied in @xcite , the transverse ( by definition , orthogonal to @xmath33 ) projection of @xmath34 has now components both in the bending plane and perpendicular to it .",
    "we will introduce , therefore , two unit vectors @xmath35 , in the direction perpendicular to the bending plane , and @xmath36 , in the radial direction , i.e. orthogonal to @xmath37 and lying in the bending plane .",
    "of course , the transverse component of @xmath34 can still be written , following @xcite , as the sum of contributions from the velocity ( `` c '' , coulomb ) and the acceleration ( `` r '' , radiation ) fields , namely    @xmath38    where    @xmath39    and    @xmath40\\ ; & .",
