    "the sign change of the hall effect observed in the superconducting state of many high-@xmath0 superconductors is one of the most puzzling problems in the electrodynamics of these materials  @xcite .",
    "one may ask then what is the doping dependence@xcite of this hall anomaly and how the vortex - lattice melting  @xcite affects the hall behavior ? alas , due to the complexity of the vortex matter many related problems are still not answered satisfactory if at all .",
    "it is quite possible that the sign reversal of the temperature dependence of the hall effect could be closely related to charging of the vortices  @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt  @xcite that the experimental solution of this enigma would provide the key towards understanding the various electromagnetic phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "the currently existing theoretical models often lead to conflicting results thus making it difficult to discriminate between all those competing explanations .",
    "in such a situation we feel it appealing to accelerate the selection by looking for simplicity in experiments with artificial structures where many of the complications typical for the real systems are avoided .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to propose an experiment for determination of the vortex charge employing transport measurement in a layered metal - insulator - superconductor ( mis ) system .",
    "we shall require that the quality of the insulator - superconductor interface be extremely high and the insulator layer be very thin .",
    "such a layered mis structure incorporating a high-@xmath0 film can be manufactured by the contemporary technology of atomic - level engineering of superconducting oxide multilayers and superlattices  @xcite .",
    "in fact , structures of the kind are now being in use for purposes of the fundamental research@xcite in the physics of high-@xmath0 superconductors , therefore the vortex charge problem can find its solution thanks to the technological progress .",
    "the simplest possible idea behind the search for the vortex charge is to study the electrostatic effect related to charged vortices  @xcite , which is analogous to electrostatic effects originating , in turn , in the bernoulli effect  @xcite due to circulating currents in a thin superconducting film in a vortex - free state ; the numerical value of the angular momentum @xmath1 is irrelevant for the current - induced contact - potential difference .",

    "( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) remains invariant .",
    "consider now a thin cuprate film thread by a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath20 as a first step we determine the distribution of the electric potential as a function of the distance to the vortex line @xmath21 for @xmath22 larger than the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) coherence length in the @xmath8-plane but smaller than the penetration depth , @xmath23 one can use the bohr - zommerfeld relation @xmath24 substituting @xmath25 from the above equation into the bernoulli theorem eq .",
    "( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) we derive the current - induced change of the electric potential @xmath26 this equation is applicable not only to the volume of the superconductor @xmath27 but even to the superconducting surface @xmath28 which is supposed to be clean enough as well as to expose the properties of the bulk material .",
    "the superconductor is capped by a thin insulating layer of thickness much smaller than the penetration depth , @xmath29 on top of the latter a thin - normal - metal layer is evaporated , hence a plane capacitor configuration is achieved , being in fact realized as a metal - insulator - superconductor ( mis ) layered structure . for definiteness the electric potential of the normal plate is set to zero .",

    "we close the electrostatic consideration of the vortex charge , but rhe reader is reffered to a number of ingenious experiments related to electrostatics of vortices which are suggested in ref .",
    "we believe , however , that the standard transport measurement have some advantage even if they are related to observations of pa - range and below .",
    "the next important step is to address the vortex flow regime of the superconducting film when a strong enough dc current density @xmath51 is applied through the superconducting film .",
    "this condition will create small dissipation and give rise to an electric field @xmath52 parallel to the current density . the electric field , in turn , creates a drift of the vortices with mean drift velocity in @xmath53-direction @xmath54 in a coordinate system moving with the vortex drift velocity @xmath55 the electric field is zero .",
    "we suppose that @xmath56 is much smaller than the critical depairing velocity @xmath57 and the bernoulli potential is nearly the same as in the dissipation - free static regime .",
    "along this line let us recall the fact that airplanes fly thanks to the bernoulli theorem that holds true for a unviscous dissipationless fluid , but the significant part of the ticket price covers the dissipated energy .",
    "by the same token , for @xmath58 the vortex - induced charge has nearly the static value @xmath59 since the charge images will follow the vortices as shadows , the vortex flow will create a two dimensional ( 2d ) current density on the surface of the normal metal @xmath60 the electric field @xmath52 resides the superconducting layer , whereas the current @xmath61 exists in the normal slab .",

    "the experiment would face the problem of measuring huge hall resistances .",
    "this sets the first technological requirement regarding to the quality of the insulating layer  in order to avoid the leakage currents the resistance @xmath69 of the plane capacitor should satisfy the relation @xmath70 in the present model we used the hydrodynamic approach applicable for extreme type - ii superconductors and completely neglected the influence of the geometrically small vortex core .",
    "however the states in vortex core can have some influence in the total charge of vortex core@xcite . in order",
    "qualitatively to `` interpolate '' a real situation with moderate ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath71 let us analyze the interface hall current for a type i superconductor . in this case the normal `` cores '' are domains of normal metal surrounded by circulating superconducting currents .",
    "this problem , certainly , is only of an academic interest and is irrelevant for the oxide superconductors .",
    "if the superconducting layer of a mis structure is of type - i superconductor , in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath72 the magnetic field in the normal domains is equal to the thermodynamic one @xmath73 and is zero in the superconducting domains .",
    "the relative area of the normal regions is @xmath74 , correspondingly the part of the superconducting area is @xmath75 thus @xmath76 and the external field is equal to the mean field @xmath77 the contact potential difference between the normal and the superconducting phase ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bulk bernoulli ] ) bellow ) is @xmath78 this contact potential difference creates , in turn , a difference in the charge density at the surface of the normal layer in front of the normal domain @xmath79 where a plane capacitor configuration is implied .",

    "the extra charges induced in the normal layer follow the moving normal domains and for the 2d current @xmath80 at the surface of the normal plate we obtain @xmath81 this very small interface hall conductivity vanishes at @xmath0 and its detection requires fa sensitivity .",

    "( [ eq : typei sigma ] ) , concerning the new predicted effect we proceed with more detailed discussion and description of the proposed new experiment in the next section .",
    "to begin with , we have sketched a `` _ _ gedanken _ _ '' experimental set - up in fig .",

    "the contemporary technology of layer - by - layer growth of oxide superconductors opens the possibility for realization of such a layered structure  a superconducting film protected by an insulating plate .",
    "moreover , we consider that a mis plane capacitor is one of the simplest possible systems employed in the fundamental research towards further technical applications .",
    "therefore we believe that the suggested experiment could become a standard tool in studying the quality of the insulator - superconductor interface . in order to check whether this idea is another case of a science fiction or , vice versa ,",

    "further , eq .  ( [ eq : hall resistance ] ) gives @xmath99  m@xmath100 and the electric field chosen gives for the voltage @xmath101  mv , therefore for the hall current we have @xmath102  pa .",
    "lastly , the vortex drift velocity @xmath103  km / s , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the depairing velocity at @xmath104 @xmath105  km / s .",
    "we note that the resistance of the capacitor should be thus at least @xmath106  m@xmath107    for conventional superconductors similar evaluations show that effect is less but still observable .",
    "one can consider , for example , a thin nb metal film grown by molecular beam epitaxy , and an al layer after oxidation in natural condition could give a good insulator layer .",
    "all technologies for planar josephson junctions provide as a rule metal - insulator interface of sufficient quality .",
    "only the insulator layer should be thick enough to prevent leakage tunneling .",
    "the example analyzed above shows that the proposed experiment is in principle possible to be carried out but we find it difficult to anticipate all problems that could arise in the course of it .",
    "for instance , due to a good capacitance cross - talk the noise created by the vortex motion in the superconducting layer will be transmitted to the normal layer thus disturbing the detection of the small hall current .",
    "we believe , however , that similar problems could be surmounted , given the challenge of the novel physics underlying the vortex charge .",
    "furthermore , it is quite possible that the charge , concentrated in the vortex core , is comparable to the charge outside , so only a detailed analysis within the microscopic theory can shine a light on the latter point . in order to verify whether a hydrodynamic approach based upon the bernoulli effect suffices to quantitatively describe the predicted vortex - charge interface current",
    "one needs independent methods to determine the effective mass of the cooper pairs . in the next section",
    "we will analyze similar experiments employing artificial mis structures .",
    "before addressing the problem of measuring the cooper pair effective mass @xmath3 let us analyze a parallel between the latter issue and the civil engineering , where in a static approximation only the weight @xmath108 is essential for a construction .",
    "in this approximation the masses could reach colossal values if we renormalize the earth acceleration @xmath109 .",
    "the uncertainty , however , immediately disappears during the first earthquake when a dynamical problem should be solved .",
    "just the same is the situation with the superconducting order parameter @xmath110in the static gl theory the superfluid density @xmath111 and the effective mass @xmath3 are inaccessible separately .",
    "they are contained in the experimental parameters , such as the penetration depth eq .",
    "( [ eq : depth ] ) , only via the ratio @xmath112 in order to determine the effective mass one has to investigate some dynamic phenomenon , which is time - dependent . due to phase invariance , however , the time @xmath113 could participate only in the gauge invariant derivative @xmath114 that is why electric field effects in superconductors are to be studied .",
    "the subtle point is that the latter are already dynamic effects even if the electric fields are static .",
    "one therefore needs to perturb the thermodynamic equilibrium of the superconductor as slightly as possible and all methods for determination of the effective mass @xmath3 of cooper pairs thus become effectively ac methods , based on the electrostatic effects in superconductors .",
    "the set - up proposed to determine the vortex charge , fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , is a mis device having four terminals .",
    "probably the most simple method to accomplish the task would be to use the same mis structure without making any contacts on the superconducting layer and to investigate the surface hall current@xcite as described in the next subsection .",

    "<S> a novel experiment for determination of the charge related to vortices in thin superconducting film is proposed and a number of related experimental set - ups are also theoretically considered . </S>",
    "<S> the methods are based on the torricelli - bernoulli effect in superconductors and the phenomenology of the effect is briefly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex charge is expressed via the effective mass of the cooper pairs , thus both parameters , inaccessible by now , could be simultaneously determined . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment would require layered metal - insulator - superconductor structures and standard electronics employed in kinetic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the insulator - superconductor interface should be high enough as to allow for observation of electric field effects similar to those investigated in superconducting field - effect transistors . </S>",
    "<S> the development of layer - by - layer growth technology of oxide superconductors provides unique possibility for investigation of new fundamental effects in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the structures necessary for determination of the vortex charge could be used to study the superconducting surface hall effect , bernoulli effect , the superfluid density , etc .. in conclusion , the systematic investigation of new effects in oxide superconductors is envisaged as an important part of the material science underlying the oxide electronics . </S>"
