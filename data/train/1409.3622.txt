    "the cebaf electron accelerator of the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) , in newport news ( va , usa ) , is currently undergoing an upgrade to increase its maximum energy from 6 to 12gev  @xcite . in the experimental hall - b , the clas spectrometer  @xcite is being modified and upgraded to clas12  @xcite , in order to operate in the new experimental conditions .",
    "the major focus of the hall - b physics program at 12gev will be the study of the internal dynamics and 3-dimensional imaging of the nucleon , quark hadronisation processes , and kaon versus pion production in hard exclusive and semi - inclusive scattering , to provide access to the flavour decomposition of the non - perturbative distribution functions .",
    "the main features of clas12 are its capability to operate at high luminosities ( on the order of @xmath0@xmath1 ) , and operation of highly polarized beam and nucleon targets .",
    "the design of the clas12 spectrometer is described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer in its present configuration does not provide an efficient kaon identification at large momenta , from 3 - 8gev / c . at such momenta ,",
    "the semi - inclusive kaon yield is one order of magnitude smaller than the pion yield .",
    "the required rejection factor for pions is then around 1:500 , corresponding to a 4@xmath2 pion - kaon separation for a contamination in the kaon sample of a few percent .",
    "moreover the baseline spectrometer detectors do not allow the separation of positive kaons from protons in the 5 - 8gev / c momentum interval .    improved particle identification and event reconstruction",
    "can be achieved in this momentum range by replacing the foreseen low - threshold cherenkov counter with a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , without any impact on the baseline design of clas12 . a study for a rich detector to be implemented within the clas12 spectrometer",
    "is reported in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , using aerogel radiators , it is possible to achieve the required identification of kaons up to 8gev / c momentum if the photon detector employed has a pad size less than than 1@xmath3 . in this respect ,",
    "a possible choice is that of multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( mapmts ) having single photon detection capabilities .",
    "this paper describes a set of experimental tests which were performed at the laboratori nazionali di frascati ( lnf ) to measure the response of hamamatsu h8500 mapmts to photons in the blue wavelength region , in order to assess their performance as single photon detectors to be used in a rich counter .",
    "this wavelength was selected to match the peak intensity of useful cherenkov radiation produced in aerogel ( uv - visible region ) .",
    "for the first time , a large sample of h8500 mapmts has been tested , and the variation between their responses assessed .",
    "moreover , two different h8500 mapmt types have been tested : both the standard and the uv - enhanced window types ( 14units of each )",
    ". the hamamatsu h8500 mapmt has previously been investigated by matsumoto _",
    "_ , through beam test studies , to be a suitable mapmt for use in a rich detector incorporating aerogel as the radiator  @xcite .",
    "the hamamatsu h8500 is a multianode bialkali photomultiplier tube , comprised of 8@xmath48 pixels and having a 12-stage amplification .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : pixelmap ] the numbering scheme from hamamatsu for the 64 pixels of the h8500 , as seen by looking at the entrance window of the mapmt .",
    "the external size is 52@xmath452mm@xmath5 , with an active area of 49@xmath449mm@xmath5 allowing a high packing fraction of @xmath6 .",
    "the pixels basically have a square cross - section with side lengths of 5.8 mm for centre pixels and 5.98 mm for edge pixels .",
    "the device has a pixel - to - pixel pitch of 6.08 mm in the centre and 6.26 mm for edge pixels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pixelmap ] .",
    "this provides an imaging plane with small dead - space .",
    "two versions of such mapmt are available : the h8500c type , with spectral response in the visible light range from 300 to 650 nm wavelengths ; and the h8500c-03 type , with enhanced response in the uv region , from 185 to 650 nm . for both mapmts ,",
    "the peak efficiency is at a wavelength of about 400 nm , in the blue light region , where the typical quantum efficiency obtained from the hamamatsu datasheet is around @xmath7  @xcite . the high voltage ( hv ) supply range recommended by hamamatsu is between -900v and -1100v , with a reference value of -1000v  @xcite .",
    "hamamatsu measured various relevant parameters of the phototubes at this reference voltage , some of which are reported in tab .",

    "the expected dark count rates of each mapmt , as calculated from the dark current values measured by hamamatsu , are also given .",
    "the reference area for the dark count rates corresponds to the mapmt size itself . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mapmts are very low noise devices , with small dark currents , and the expected dark count rates ( @xmath8 ) for each of the mapmts , as calculated from the dark currents measured by hamamatsu ( @xmath9 ) , are also given in tab .",
    "[ tab : pmt_sheets ] .",
    "the dark currents measured by hamamatsu are quoted globally per mapmt , and therefore the reference area for the dark count rates given in tab .",

    "level , the expected dark count rates were calculated as shown in equation  [ eq : darkcountrate ] , where : @xmath10 is the selected time interval and was set to 1s ; @xmath11 is the gain of the mapmt ; @xmath12 is the elementary charge .",
    "@xmath13 these dark count rates were used to calculate the expected background arising from dark noise in the mapmts of the clas12 rich detector .",
    "they were concluded to be negligible , with a mean probability of @xmath143@xmath410@xmath15 dark counts expected from each mapmt per clas12 detector data acquisition time window of 250ns .",
    "the dark noise behaviour of the mapmts is therefore not considered to cause any concern for their application in the clas12 rich detector and so we do not discuss this topic any further .",
    "we tested the response of the h8500 mapmts reported in tab .  [",
    "tab : pmt_sheets ] to a low intensity laser beam , at the lnf .",
    "the test set - up included a laser emitting blue light ( in the region close to where the hamamatsu h8500 mapmt has its maximal quantum efficiency ) and standard vme electronics for the readout .",
    "two motorised step motors were also employed to remotely move the laser beam across the mapmt entrance window . during measurements ,",
    "the distance between the end of the collimator and the mapmt surface was as small as possible ( roughly 1 mm ) , in order that the mapmt surface was positioned in the focal plane of the laser beam .",
    "the set - up was installed inside a light - tight box to isolate the mapmt from any background light , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : set_up ] .          for the light source we used a pilas eig1000d picosecond injection laser  @xcite , a compact system based on a laser diode , emitting monochromatic light at the wavelength of 407.2 nm .",
    "the light was transported from the laser diode to inside the light - tight box via a fiber - optical cable .",
    "a 1 mm diameter , 50 mm long black pvc custom - made mechanical collimator was attached to the lens collimator connected to the end of the fiber - optical cable and then mounted onto a mechanical support which was driven by two high precision nrt150 motors from thorlabs  @xcite ( one for each of the horizontal and vertical movements ) .",
    "the motors were remotely controlled so that the support could be moved across the entire surface of the mapmt entrance window and illuminate one by one of all its 64 pixels . with this set - up it was possible to perform automised scans of the response of all pixels of each mapmt . for the scans , with the collimator as close as possible to the mapmt ,",
    "the diameter of the laser spot on the mapmt surface was 0.9 mm .",
    "this value was obtained through the use of a ccd ( hamamatsu c9260 - 901 board camera ) to image the laser spot at the mapmt position .",
    "the intensity of the laser beam was reduced down to the level of a few photons per pulse by using edmund optics uv - vis neutral density filters  @xcite , which were mounted after the collimator .",
    "finer adjustments were possible by changing the settings of the laser tune ( relative intensity ) on its controller unit , allowing to vary the photon intensity within the linear range of its performance .",
    "the tests were done typically with the filters having a total attenuation factor on the order of @xmath1610@xmath17 and a laser tune setting of @xmath1625% .",
    "the pulse repetition rate was driven by and controlled by the data acquisition ( daq ) readout program and was set to 100hz for the duration of the tests .",
    "we used standard vme electronics to read the 64 anodes of one h8500 at a time .",
    "a caen v2718 vme bridge , connected to a computer via an optical fiber , was used to generate the _ trigger in _ signal for the pilas .",
    "after arrival of this _ trigger in _ signal and before emitting the light pulses , the pilas controller generated a ttl _ trigger out _ signal that , reshaped through a caen n89 nim / ttl converter and stretched to a length of 40ns through a caen n93b dual timer , was used as the gate signal for the readout of two caen v792 qdcs .",
    "the caen v792 qdc is a fast , 32 channel charge - to - digital converter with a dynamical range of 400pc and a resolution of @xmath16100fc .",
    "the analogue signals of all the 64 pixels of an mapmt were extracted through custom designed readout boards , which were designed to provide one common ground line amongst all pixels .",
    "the signals were then sent directly to the v792 qdcs using four 16-channel twisted - pair flat - ribbon cables .",
    "having the goal of measuring qdc spectra in the few p.e .",
    "regime , it was extremely important to check the noise level of the electronics .",
    "for this , we ran for several hours with the entire set - up in its operating conditions , but with the surface of the mapmt covered by a black cap , so that no light could reach the photocathode .",
    "the result for a representative pixel of one of the tested mapmts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : daq_noise ] .",
    "we find for this pedestal a gaussian distribution with a width of 0.53qdc channels , i.e. @xmath1453fc . for the recorded events ( more than @xmath18 ) we find an excess of about 250 entries beyond a 5@xmath2 cut , corresponding to a probability of @xmath19 for finding noise hits above the 5@xmath2 threshold .",
    "similar results were found for all the mapmts .",
    "the behaviour also reflects the low dark - noise characteristics of the mapmts , as listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : pmt_sheets ] , and confirms that background noise from the mapmts is not expected to be an issue for their application in the clas12 rich detector .",
    "overall , the width of the gaussian distributions fitted to the pedestals were about 0.5qdc channels , corresponding to 50fc of integrated charge .",
    "the pedestal noise matched exactly the resolution of the qdcs used , indicating a low noise set - up suitable for the single photon tests .      before starting the systematic study of the response of all mapmts",
    ", a single mapmt was selected to perform a finer scan of some typical pixels with a laser spot of diameter 90@xmath20 m and step size of 0.1 mm in both directions , in order to verify the uniformity of the response across its pixels surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the response across the pixel active area was found to be sufficiently homogeneous and uniform for the clas12 rich application .",
    "furthermore , the mapmt pixel size and dead - space regions measured by the fine scans were as expected , fulfilling the position resolution requirement of the rich detector . from these tests",
    "it was concluded that a coarser resolution scan could be employed to test the significant sample of 28 mapmts .",
    "the tests of the 28 mapmts have been performed using an automated procedure , in which a pedestal run ( with laser off ) was performed first . then the laser head was moved to illuminate the centre of pixel 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pixelmap ] ) , the laser was switched on and 10k events were taken with all 64 pixels read out simultaneously .",
    "the laser then was moved to the centre of the next pixel and the measurement was repeated . with this procedure for the laser measurements",
    ", we were able to study the entire mapmt response when a single pixel was illuminated by the laser and also when the pixel was not illuminated , the latter condition providing useful information on the cross talk between channels .",
    "after sequencing through all 64 pixels , the laser was switched off and another pedestal run was taken , to check the stability of the electronics .      the analysis of the data have been performed following the method described in  @xcite . for this , the qdc spectrum measured by each pixel has been fitted using equation  [ eq : qdcfit ] , where @xmath21 is the qdc channel readout and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions ( normalised to 1 ) describing the shape of the pedestal and of the @xmath24 p.e .",

    ", with @xmath20 being the average number of detected p.e .. the parameter @xmath27 represents a normalisation constant term that , since all the factors in the sum are normalised to one , gives the total number of recorded events .",

    "typically , the average number of detected p.e . was @xmath36 , so that the total number of p.e . peaks considered in the fit was chosen to be 5 .",
    "the fit description used was slightly simplified with respect to the full possible model given in  @xcite , which may include contributions from different background effects , such as photon conversions on the first dynode stage of the mapmt for example .",
    "this was due mostly to the relatively low resolution of the qdc spectra , in conjunction with the fact that the relation given in equation  [ eq : qdcfit ] was found to describe the spectra well , whilst also providing the most successful automisation and convergence of the fits .",
    "for the narrow pedestals measured ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : daq_noise ] ) a simple gaussian model was used , while for the p.e .",
    "peaks several different parametrisations have been tried .",
    "it was found that the best results ( in terms of convergence of the fits and of uniformity of the function parameters ) were obtained using gaussian distributions as well , even though other shapes could provide in some cases slightly better values of @xmath37 .",

    "the cross talk values obtained in this study represent an upper limit on the magnitudes , since the measurements were performed without use of a mask covering all mapmt pixels , except from the illuminated one .",
    "subsequent studies have shown that the incorporation of such a mask reduces the cross talk observed , due to the elimination of contributions from stray laser light .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : h8500_xtalk_mask](a ) shows the spectra of one pixel from the ca4686 mapmt , like in fig .  [",
    "fig : ca4658_25_hv_qdc ] , when illuminated directly with the collimated light source or when its neighbours are illuminated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h8500_xtalk_mask](b ) we show the equivalent spectra for the same pixel obtained with a mask put in front of the mapmt , which blocks any illumination of neighbouring pixels .",
    "the mask consists of a black pvc square with outer dimensions matching those of the mapmt and a thickness of 0.5 mm .",
    "the mask is perforated with a matrix of 1 mm diameter holes which are positioned at the centres of each of the 64 pixel positions . in the second case",
    "the number of signals above threshold seen when the neighbouring pixels are illuminated is significantly reduced .",
    "for the pixel presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : h8500_xtalk_mask ] the cross talk integrated over all neighbours went down from @xmath144% without mask to @xmath141% with mask .",
    "this represents one of the strongest reductions we have seen .",
    "the cross talk probabilities for all pixels of the ca4686 mapmt at 1075v without and with the mask in place are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : h8500_xtalk_nomask_allpixels ] and [ fig : h8500_xtalk_mask_allpixels ] respectively .",
    "as expected , the cross talk levels are mostly reduced when a mask is used , with the exception of some spurious points .",
    "it is concluded that , even based upon the slightly higher cross talk values measured without use of a mask , the mapmts are low cross talk devices and this noise source is not problematic for their use in the clas12 rich detector .",
    "the positions of the rich detector mapmts in the clas12 spectrometer are located within the fringe field of the torus magnet . from simulations",
    "only a very small maximum field strength of 3.5gauss is expected as the worst case , for a few of the mapmts , mainly the transverse direction .",
    "we studied the performance of an example h8500 mapmt ( ca4655 ) when placed within a magnetic field , ranging from strengths of 5gauss to 50gauss , to evaluate any degradation of its signal properties .",
    "the hv of the mapmt was set to -1040v for the duration of the tests , and laser scans were performed with and without the presence of the magnetic field . for this , the experimental set - up was modified to include a dipole magnet within the light - tight box .",
    "the arrangement and orientation of the dipole magnet used is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magneticfieldsetup ] .",
    "the magnet was cylindrical in shape , with an outer diameter of @xmath1425.0 cm and an inner diameter of @xmath148.5 cm , allowing the mapmt to be fully inserted within the magnet .",
    "the magnetic field was roughly mapped before use using an external probe .",
    "it was uniform in the vertical ( y ) direction within 10% , transverse to the mapmt axis and along the direction from pixel 57 to pixel 1 ( according to the map in fig .",
    "[ fig : pixelmap ] ) , and negligible in the horizontal ( x ) and longitudinal ( z ) directions . within the 10% uniformity ,",
    "the field in the y direction slightly increased towards the surfaces of the dipole coils .",
    "the upper limit for the field strength of the magnet was @xmath46gauss , where @xmath47 denotes the magnetic field strength in the vertical y direction .",
    "four field strengths in total were tested : 5 , 10 , 25 and 50gauss .",
    "the standard fit function ( equation  [ eq : qdcfit ] ) was used to describe the spectra .",
    "some examples of fitted spectra obtained from a typical inner pixel ( pixel 28 ) at the different field strengths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_spectra_p28 ] .",
    "+    as shown , the spectra were unaffected by the magnetic field from 5gauss up to 25gauss . the pedestal and first p.e .",
    "peak fit parameter , @xmath48 , were stable consistent with the fit error .",
    "for a field of 50gauss a small increase in the number of events filling the valley region separating pedestal caused the fit to be marginally less successful in describing the amplitude of the first p.e .",
    "this resulted in a reduction of the fitted gain ( @xmath40 ) which was on the order of only one qdc bin ( 100fc ) .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed for the other inner pixels of the mapmt and it was concluded that no major degradations in the signals were visible .",
    "a priori it was expected that corner and edge channels of the mapmt may be affected worse by the magnetic fields than centre pixels .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_cornerspectra ] for a corner pixel of the mapmt ( pixel 64 ) . for field strengths 5 and 10gauss",
    "no significant change was observed in the signal spectra , but starting from 25gauss a reduction in the signal gain , @xmath40 , is observable . at 50gauss",
    "this reduction is @xmath14200fc or about 20% of the signal gain .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed in the remaining corner and edge pixels .     +    in figs .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_relgainsvpixel](a ) and ( b ) we show the gains extracted from fits ( @xmath40 ) to the spectra of all pixels of the mapmt relative to the values obtained without magnetic field , at magnetic field settings of 5 and 10gauss , and 25 and 50gauss respectively .",
    "for a few data points , typically for pixels on the edge of the mapmt , an increase of the gain @xmath40 with magnetic field was deducted .",
    "this is regarded as an artefact , caused by combination of the low resolution of the spectra and the lower relative intrinsic gains of the affected channels . in such circumstances",
    "the applied fit may not represent the signal gain well for one of the data points in the ratio presented .",
    "for the majority of pixels , the relative @xmath40 gain values were largely unaffected by magnetic fields of 5 and 10gauss ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_relgainsvpixel](a ) ) , when fitting errors are considered .",
    "stronger systematic drops in the @xmath40 gain were more visible across all pixels for the 25 and 50gauss results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_relgainsvpixel](b ) ) , with relative reductions of around 5 - 10% and 10 - 20% extracted on average for the two field settings respectively . a relative reduction of @xmath1410 - 20% corresponds to a difference on the order of 1 or 2qdc bins .",
    "the results therefore do not indicate a significant problem for single photon counting with this mapmt in the clas12 rich application .",
    "the fit results also do not show any strong distortion in the shapes of the spectra , as a function of magnetic field strength .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_relwidthsvpixel ] gives the width of the first p.e .",
    "peak,@xmath42 , for all pixels relative to the values without field , again for all field settings .",
    "overall the shape of the signals were mostly consistent , up to a field strength of 50gauss .",
    "only a few data points with poor fit results , already discussed for fig .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_relgainsvpixel ] , deviated from this general behaviour .",
    "the resolution limit of this method is of the order of 1qdc channel , or about 30% of the typical signal width . but this is sufficient to deduct that the requirements for operation in the clas12 rich detector are met .    the first p.e .",
    "peak gain ( @xmath40 ) and width ( @xmath42 ) results averaged over all mapmt pixels are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : magfieldstudy_meanresultsgainsigma](a ) and ( b ) , where the results have been separated into sub - sets depending upon the pixel locations on the mapmt face .",
    "these averaged results illustrate more clearly a dependence upon pixel position , with edge and corner pixels being the most affected by the magnetic field .",
    "even though in the magnetic field survey a 10% variation in the field strength has been measured towards the edges , the data significantly characterises the behaviour of the mapmt . for comparison",
    "the averages over all pixels are given as well .",
    "overall there is a relatively significant reduction in the averaged gain , @xmath40 , of the first p.e .",
    "peak of @xmath141qdc bin or 100fc observed , corresponding to about @xmath1412% reduction in the signal gain for an external field of 50gauss in the studied transverse direction .",
    "this yields no appreciable deterioration for the application in the clas12 rich detectors .",
    "the drop in the averaged signal width , @xmath42 , is also relatively significant and corresponds to roughly 4% for a field of 50gauss .",
    "this reduction is not as strong as may be expected , and the increases in @xmath42 widths for edge and corner pixels at field settings of 5 and 10 gauss are also unexpected .",
    "however , these effects are likely caused by the success of the fit function in combination with the low resolution spectra and the absence of any signal amplification , resulting in the parameter @xmath42 to be over - estimated if the first p.e .",
    "peak is too close to the pedestal .",
    "it was also planned to study the effects of longitudinal magnetic fields , with respect to the direction of the mapmt axis , since from previous studies of the h8500 mapmt these fields are expected to have the strongest effect on its performance  @xcite , however these studies were not possible with the set - up due to space restrictions .",
    "moreover , the rich mapmts will not be subjected to any longitudinal fields in clas12 . only small components in this direction",
    "are expected , which could arise from non - uniformities in the torus magnet and would not be large enough to affect the behaviour of the mapmts .",
    "to summarise , at small field strengths , even which are larger than those expected in the clas12 rich , no effect was observed in the mapmt response within the sensitivity of the set - up .",
    "significant differences in the signals only occurred at the largest field setting of 50gauss . within an equivalent scope ,",
    "the results are in agreement with previous studies of the h8500 behaviour in magnetic field environments  @xcite .",
    "for the first time , a significant sample of two different types of hamamatsu h8500 mapmts ( 14@xmath4914 ) has been tested , pixel by pixel , using a dedicated laser beam , at different hv values and also within a ( weak ) magnetic field .",
    "the overall aim of these studies was to assess the performances of the h8500 mapmts as single photon detectors , in view of their use in the clas12 rich detector .",
    "the results show that the hamamatsu h8500 mapmts can be used successfully for such purposes , even if a voltage slighter higher than the recommended one ( -1000v ) significantly improves their performances for single photon detection .",
    "the fraction of the single photoelectron spectrum lost below the pedestal peak is important for the application of mapmts to a rich detector and , for the majority of the tested h8500 mapmts a loss fraction of less than 20% was measured at an hv value of 1075v .",
    "additionally , the performances of the h8500 mapmts are expected to be practically unaffected in the weak magnetic fringe field foreseen in the clas12 spectrometer .    these results , which agree with and expand upon what has similarly been reported for a smaller sample of the h8500 mapmt  @xcite , confirm their selection and suitability for use in a rich detector for clas12 ."
