    "studies of high - energy neutrinos produced by @xmath2b decay in the sun have shown that when these neutrinos are detected on earth the number that remain electron neutrinos ( @xmath7 s ) is only about half of the number that have oscillated into other active species  @xcite .",

    "the predicted @xmath2b production rate  @xcite is based on solar - model calculations that incorporate measured reaction rates for each of the solar burning steps following the initial @xmath8 reaction , the most uncertain of which is the @xmath0be(p,@xmath1)@xmath2b rate . the currently recommended value for s@xmath4(0 ) , the astrophysical s - factor for this reaction , is @xmath9 ev b  @xcite .",
    "however , s@xmath4(0 ) must be known to better than @xmath10 in order that its uncertainty not be important in the predicted @xmath7 production rate  @xcite .    because of the key role of s@xmath4(0 )",

    "the direct technique has the advantage that it studies the reaction that actually occurs in the sun , but is difficult experimentally because it requires a radioactive target or beam , and the cross sections are small .    our direct measurements reported here incorporated several improvements over traditional methods .",
