    "the precision of the experimental data on electroweak interactions and qcd is now very high and it is expected to become significantly higher within the next few years .",
    "this has triggered a substantial refinement in the corresponding theoretical calculations . yet ,",
    "already now for certain experimental quantities the theoretical uncertainty is one of the major open questions in the interpretation of the data and in the search for signals of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a striking example is the need for a precise determination of the gauge couplings at the weak scale , which is the prerequisite for investigation of possible unification of couplings at some gut scale .",
    "one of the reasons for this current state of affairs in the relation between the theory and experiment is that computation of high orders in perturbation theory for quantum field theories , and especially non - abelian gauge theories in @xmath0 dimensions is extremely hard .",
    "state - of - the - art calculations available today for this kind of theories have reached , after a very large effort , the 3-rd and the 4-th order in @xmath1 , for observables and for the @xmath2-function , respectively @xcite . without a major breakthrough in the relevant techniques it is unlikely that exact results for the next order will become available in the foreseeable future . moreover , even if explicit expressions for very high order terms do become available , we still have to deal with the fact that the perturbative series of interest are asymptotic , with zero radius of convergence and usually are not even borel summable . in this talk",
    "i will review an approach which has been recently suggested to deal with some of these problems .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the perturbation series in qcd is expected to be asymptotic with rapidly growing coefficients : s(x ) = ^_n=0 c_n x^n  , x  , c_n n!k^n n^[genericseries ] for some coefficients @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "anyone who wants to make use of qcd perturbation theory to carry out precision analysis of observables has to face several practical problems :    * only few first orders in ( [ genericseries ] ) are known for any observable ( @xmath4 ) * the series has zero radius of convergence * the series is usually not _",
    "borel summable_. borel summation is a trick that sometimes works for summing series with factorial divergence .",
    "consider the series for @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ genericseries ] ) .",
    "we can define a new function , @xmath6 , whose series is obtained from ( [ genericseries ] ) by dividing the @xmath7-th term by @xmath8 , ( y ) = ^_n=0 ( c_nn ! ) y^n [ borelseries ] if the new series is convergent , the original function @xmath5 can be obtained by the so - called inverse borel transform , s(x ) = 1x_0^e^-y / x s(y ) dy [ invboreltransform ] provided @xmath6 has no singularities along the integration path . 0.5truecm",
    "the presence of singularities along the integration path makes the integral ( [ invboreltransform ] ) ill - defined .",
    "one can try to define it by going around the poles , but this introduces an ambiguity proportional to the pole residue , since different deformations of the integration path will give different results .",
    "* renormalization scale dependence : finite - order perturbative predictions depend on the arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath9 through the coupling , @xmath10 .",
    "this renormalization scale is most pronounced at leading order in perturbation theory and decreases with the inclusion of higher order terms .",
    "* renormalization scheme dependence : in principle , the theory can be renormalized in any valid renormalization scheme , yielding the same predictions for any physical observable . in practice , when we work with a finite number of perturbative terms , the results depend on the renormalization scheme .",
    "there is no  miracle cure \" which would solve these problems completely .",
    "however , we should and can minimize their effect .",
    "thus the practical issue is how to get the best possible precision , given a fixed number of terms in the perturbative expansion . in the following ,",
    "i will discuss one method which has already shown considerable progress towards this goal .",
    "the method is based on the so - called pad approximants ( pa - s ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "pad approximants @xcite are rational functions chosen to have a taylor expansion equal the perturbative series to the order calculated .",
    "given a series s(x ) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + + c_n x^n + o(x^n+1 ) [ ston ] one can always find a rational function  : l+m = n [ padedef ] such that @xmath11 $ ] has the taylor series = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + + c_n x^n + c_n+1 x^n+1 + [ lmseries ] the rational function in ( [ padedef ] ) is called the @xmath11 $ ] pad approximant .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that at a given finite order in @xmath12 the @xmath11 $ ] pad in ( [ padedef ] ) is formally as valid representation of @xmath5 as the original perturbation expansion .",
    "moreover , in practice the pa - s turn out to posses many important and useful properties which are absent in the straightforward perturbation theory .",
    "thus , even though pa is constructed to reproduce the series ( [ ston ] ) only up to order @xmath13 , it turns out that under rather mild conditions the next term in the taylor expansion of the pa in eq .",
    "( [ lmseries ] ) , @xmath14 , provides a good estimate , @xmath15 .",
    "we call it the _ pade approximant prediction _ ( pap ) , of the next coefficient @xmath16 in the series ( [ ston ] ) : -1 1 [ esti ] and for sufficiently large @xmath13 the relative error decays exponentially fast , -1 ~ e^-n,= [ estii ] let us consider some simple examples , starting with the trivial case of a single - pole geometric series = _ n=0^c_n x^n [ singlepole ] it is easy to convince oneself that in this case the @xmath11 $ ] pad is _ exact _ for @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "for example , if we attempt to construct a [ 10/10 ] pad of ( [ singlepole ] ) , we will find that the _ a priori _ 10-th degree polynomials in numerator and denominator reduce to a degenerate case of a constant and 1-st degree polynomial , respectively , = [ tenten ] once this is clear , the extension to a sum of finite number of poles in obvious , _ i=1^k = _",
    "n=0^c_n x^n l k-1 ,   m k [ npoles ] one can also show that for an infinite number of isolated poles , i.e. when @xmath19 is a meromorphic function , the sequence of @xmath20 $ ] for @xmath21 fixed converges to @xmath22 as @xmath23 , _",
    "l f(x ) ; k = 0 , 1 , 2 ,  a somewhat less intuitive , but very important result is that in certain cases the pad sequence @xmath20 $ ] converges exponentially fast in @xmath24 to the correct function even for a factorially divergent asymptotic series with zero radius of convergence .",
    "a classical example @xcite is the function g(x ) = _ 0^ d t = _ 0^(-x)^nn ! [ factorialseries ] here again it turns out that @xmath20 \\ , \\longrightarrow \\ , g(x)$ ] as @xmath25 .",
    "the crucial property of the series in ( [ factorialseries ] ) which makes this possible is that it has alternating signs .",
    "it is easy to show that this implies that all the poles of the borel transform of ( [ factorialseries ] ) are on the negative real axis , and hence that the series is borel summable . more generally ,",
    "when the series is borel summable , pad will converge to the correct result .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exponentially fast convergence of pa - s is not limited to meromorphic functions . as a simple example , consider the hypergeometric function @xmath26 @xcite , which has a cut for @xmath27 .",
    "[ hyperfig ] shows that despite the cut , the diagonal pa - s evaluated at @xmath28 converge exponentially fast .",
    "while such mathematical examples are instructive , in order to gain confidence in the method , we need to see how it fares on high - order series taken from quantum field theory . as the first test case",
    ", we consider the scalar field theory with gaussian propagators .",
    "high - order perturbation expansions of green s functions in this theory have been computed in ref .",
    "[ phi4fig ] demonstrates the convergence of pap for the relevant coefficients for the 4-point green s function in @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the relative error is @xmath30 at 5-th order . for comparison",
    "also shown are relative errors of estimates based on asymptotic behavior of large orders in perturbation theory , as given in @xcite . clearly , at 5-th order pad does better by about 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "if information is available about the asymptotic behavior of @xmath31 , it is possible to obtain an explicit expression for the the error formula on the r.h.s . of ( [ estii ] ) .",
    "for example , we have demonstrated that if _",

    "( [ efive ] ) yields an exponential decrease of the the error , as in eq .",
    "( [ estii ] ) .",
    "this prediction agrees very well with the known errors in the pap s @xcite for the qcd vacuum polarization d function calculated in the large @xmath35 approximation @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figiii]a .",
    "one can repeat this exercise also for the borel transform of the d function series .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a generic borel transform is characterized by the presence of poles ( more generally , branch points ) on the real axis . in view of this",
    ", we expect an even faster convergence in this case , since the pad , being a rational function , is particularly well - suited to reproduce this analytic structure .",
    "indeed , it turns out that in this case @xmath36 and _ [ m / m ] - [ eeight ] which agrees very well with the corresponding pap results shown in fig .",

    "the high degree of agreement between the analytical error estimates in eqs .",

    "( [ efour ] ) , and @xmath39 is obtained by fitting ( [ efive ] ) to the known lower orders @xcite .",
    "the apap method results not only in a substantial improvement of the pap estimates , but also significantly reduces the difference between the predictions based on different @xmath11 $ ] values at a given order , .",
    "the method has been applied to the bjorken sum rule for the difference of first moments of proton and neutron structure functions @xmath40 in polarized deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "for @xmath41 the sum rule reads ^1_0 [ g_1^p(x , q^2 ) - g_1^n(x , q^2 ) ] = 1 6 |g_a|-0.2em [ bjf ] where @xmath42 and the exact expression for @xmath43 is still unknown .",
    "the pap and the corresponding apap estimates of @xmath43 are    lccc [ 2/1 ] : & c_4^pap 114 & & c_4^apap 131 +   + [ 1/2 ] : & c_4^pap 111 & & c_4^apap 130    [ c4bjsr ] clearly , apap estimates show significantly less spread than the corresponding pap estimates .",
    "remarkably , the apap estimates of @xmath44 show an almost perfect agreement with an independent estimate , based on a completely different method @xcite : @xmath45 !    as already mentioned , a typical finite order perturbative series such as ( [ bjf ] ) exhibits a spurious renormalization scale and scheme dependence .",
    "schematically we have , _ =",
    "_ + _ [ observable ] replacing a finite - order perturbative series by a pad is equivalent to adding an infinite series of estimated terms generated by the rational approximant .",
    "if such an estimate is accurate , we expect to see a reduction in the renormalization scheme and scale dependence . as shown in fig .",
    "[ parcol ] , this expectation is fully realized when pad is applied @xcite to the bjorken sum rule series in eq .",
    "( [ bjf ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this dramatic reduction in the scale and scheme dependence can also be understood on a deeper level . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the large-@xmath46 limit , i.e. when the @xmath2 function is dominated by the one loop contribution , the scale dependence is removed completely .",
    "this is because in this limit the renormalization scale transformation of @xmath1 reduces to a homographic transformation of the pad argument .",
    "diagonal pa s are invariant under such transformations @xcite . non - diagonal pa s are not totally invariant , but they reduce the rs dependence significantly @xcite . in the real world",
    "the usual  @xmath2 function includes higher - order terms beyond @xmath46 .",
    "still , in qcd with @xmath47 , the 1-loop running of the coupling is dominant and therefore pa s are still almost invariant under change of renormalization scale .",
    "a further related interesting development is the observation @xcite that the pade approximant approach for resummation of perturbative series in qcd provides a systematic method for approximating the flow of momentum in feynman diagrams . in the large-@xmath46 limit , diagonal pa",
    "s generalize the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) scale - setting method @xcite to higher orders in a renormalization scale- and scheme - invariant manner .    -1truecm",
    "although no qcd observables have been calculated exactly beyond @xmath48 , in fall of 1996 we had learned that a calculation of the 4-loop contribution to the qcd @xmath2 function was under way , and likely to be published soon .",
    "the prediction of the unknown 4-loop coefficient @xcite was therefore an important challenge and excellent testing ground for the new apap method .",
    "as a warm - up exercise one can test the apap method on the 4-loop @xmath2 function of the @xmath49 theory with @xmath50 global vector symmetry @xcite , the latter being analogous to the @xmath51 global symmetry of qcd .",
    "the results @xcite for @xmath52 in @xmath50 @xmath49 theory are shown in figure [ betaphi4 ] .",
    "clearly , the variant of apap method denoted as @xmath53 ( see @xcite for details ) is markedly superior to the naive pap .",
    "the 5-loop @xmath2 function in this theory is also known @xcite and the corresponding apap estimates also turn out to be very precise @xcite .",
    "consequently this was the method of choice for the qcd 4-loop @xmath2 function .",
    "the strategy for computing @xmath52 , the 4-loop @xmath2 function coefficient , is as follows .",
    "we recall that @xmath52 is a cubic polynomial in the number of flavors @xmath35 : _",
    "3 = a_3 + b_3 n_f + c_3 n_f^2 + d_3 n_f^3 , [ beta3form ] where @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) is known from large-@xmath35 calculations @xcite .",
    "the known exact expressions for the 1- , 2- and 3-loop @xmath2 function are used as input to apap , to predict the value of @xmath52 for a range of @xmath35 values .",
    "the predictions for @xmath56 are then obtained from fitting the apap results for @xmath57 to a polynomial of the form ( [ beta3form ] ) .    shortly after the apap prediction of @xmath52 @xcite",
    "the exact result was published in ref .",
    "one important lesson from the exact results is that they contain qualitatively new color factors , corresponding to quartic casimirs , analogous to light - by - light scattering diagrams in qed .",
    "such terms are not present at 2- and 3-loop level , and therefore can not be estimated using the pad method .",
    "numerically the correction due to these new color factors is not very large , but in principle the pap estimates should be compared with the rest of the exact expression , as is done in the first three columns of table  i. # 1        the apap estimates for @xmath58 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 seem quite satisfactory , until one realizes that the @xmath58 and @xmath60 terms in ( [ beta3form ] ) have opposite signs and their magnitude is such that they almost cancel each other at @xmath62 .",
    "this means that for numerical prediction of @xmath52 as function of @xmath35 in the physically interesting range @xmath63 a better precision is required .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to obtain such precision .",
    "this is accomplished by formally using negative values of @xmath35 in the fitting procedure , so that no cancellation occurs , and making a careful choice of the range of negative values of @xmath35 used for the fit .",
    "once the values of @xmath58 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained this way , one can use them to compute the physical predictions at positive @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been referred to as wapap , for  weighted apap \" .",
    "the corresponding results are shown and compared with exact results in the last two columns of table i. we see a dramatic improvement in the precision .",
    "figure [ beta3_error ] displays graphically predictions for @xmath52 , as a function of @xmath35 for the most interesting case @xmath64 .",
    "we plot the percentage relative errors obtained using various apap - based estimation schemes @xcite : naive apap s fitted with positive @xmath65 ( diamonds ) , naive apap s fitted with negative @xmath66 , wapap s compared to the exact value of @xmath52 including quartic casimir terms , and wapap s compared to @xmath52 without quartic casimir terms ( crosses ) .",
    "we see that the latter are the most accurate for @xmath52 in qcd .    in figure [ beta3_vs_nf_vs_nc ]",
    "we show the error in the wapap prediction for @xmath52 as a function of @xmath35 , for @xmath673 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 10 , once again omitting quartic casimir terms from the exact result .",
    "the accuracy of these predictions is our best evidence for believing in the utility of the wapap method .",
    "the wapap method does very well on the four - loop qcd @xmath2 function , but the details of the method were fine - tuned after the exact results became available . in ref .",
    "@xcite predictions were also given for yet unknown 5-loop @xmath2 function in qcd and 4- and 5-loop @xmath2 function in @xmath68 supersymmetric qcd .",
