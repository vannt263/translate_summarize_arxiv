    "@xcite , but in this case such an extension has no obvious advantages .    from a practical point of view , the strategy we are suggesting is that simulations are performed with an unquenched @xmath0-quark , and two partially - quenched non - degenerate light quarks .",

    "this approach should converge quite nicely for matrix elements in the nucleon for small enough meson masses , however , this is not expected to converge well for matrix elements in baryons containing one or more @xmath0-quarks .",
    "this is because the energy difference between an intermediate state with a kaon , in three - flavor @xmath11pt , e.g. @xmath119 , and an intermediate state with a pion , e.g. @xmath120 , is not large .",
    "the spin - singlet matrix elements we studied in the previous sections have the same chiral structures at nnlo .",

    "<S> the strange quark , @xmath0 , contribution to the properties of the nucleon provides a direct probe of the non - valence structure of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0-quarks were significantly more massive than @xmath1 , as are the @xmath2- and @xmath3-quarks , their contributions could be determined within the framework of perturbative qcd , and could be simply incorporated in the coefficients of operators involving up , @xmath4 , and down , @xmath5 , quarks and gluons , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath0-quarks are light enough so that their contribution to nucleon properties are important and they should be considered as dynamical degrees of freedom in the nucleon , but heavy enough so that precise experimental measurements and the development of a rigorous theoretical description are challenging .    currently , several @xmath0-quark properties of the nucleon have been determined experimentally , including the contribution to the nucleon mass , @xmath7 @xcite , the @xmath0-quark helicity contribution to the proton spin , @xmath8  @xcite , the @xmath0-quark contribution to the proton magnetic moment , @xmath9  @xcite , and the unpolarized @xmath0-quark parton distribution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , ongoing experiments are expected to map out the strange electric and magnetic form factors  @xcite in the near future . for the determinations of @xmath10 and @xmath8 , an expansion about the su(3 ) flavor symmetry limit , in which the @xmath4- , @xmath5- and @xmath0-quarks are degenerate , is used but , unfortunately , in the absence of further experimental inputs , higher order su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects  @xcite can only be estimated with hadronic models or with the leading non - analytic contributions from kaon loops computed in three - flavor chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath11pt ) . to accommodate the sometimes slower than expected convergence of the su(3 ) expansion in the baryon sector </S>",
    "<S> , conservative error estimates inevitably lead to large uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> lattice simulations of the @xmath0-quark properties of the nucleon , and the presently needed extrapolation to the physical quark masses must also deal with this issue . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12pt  @xcite and its quenched- and partially - quenched extensions , quenched @xmath12pt ( q@xmath12pt )  @xcite and partially - quenched @xmath12pt ( pq@xmath12pt )  @xcite , respectively , with both two and three flavors have been widely used to extrapolate physical quantities simulated on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one has confidence that for small enough quark masses both the two - flavor and three - flavor theories converge . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the three - flavor theory the relatively large value of the @xmath0-quark mass means that the issue of convergence must be explored on an observable - by - observable basis . </S>",
    "<S> if the su(3 ) expansion is found not to converge rapidly it can not provide a reliable extrapolation of the lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the chiral extrapolations of strange matrix elements in the nucleon computed in lattice simulations do not suffer from the slow convergence of su(3 ) @xmath12pt , and the two - flavor chiral expansion is sufficient for chiral extrapolations of these observables . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is very simple  one does not need to know the @xmath0-quark mass dependence for the purpose of chiral extrapolation . in lattice simulations only the @xmath4- and @xmath5-quark masses are heavier than their physical values , while the @xmath0-quark can be simulated with its physical mass . </S>",
    "<S> any variations in the @xmath0-quark mass can be implemented as an interpolation , rather than an extrapolation .    in su(2 ) @xmath12pt , the small expansion parameter of the theory is @xmath13 where in nature the physical pion mass is @xmath14 mev , the @xmath15-nucleon mass difference is @xmath16 mev , and @xmath17 is the characteristic momentum transfer in any given process . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is the `` high - energy '' scale set by the energy gap to strange hadronic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a naive estimate of @xmath19 mev , ( accidentally close to the @xmath20 meson mass ) roughly reflects the energy cost to create a @xmath21 pair . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath22 in the real world su(2 ) expansion for low energy processes , consistent with the discussions found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the chiral extrapolation of strange matrix elements , the @xmath23 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eps ] ) also sets the radius of convergence of two - flavor pq@xmath12pt to be @xmath24  mev . </S>",
    "<S> one expects the theory to converge rapidly for `` @xmath25''@xmath26  mev .    for exploratory studies , </S>",
    "<S> several @xmath0-quark properties have been computed in quenched simulations  @xcite . as pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the fact that large-@xmath27 quenched qcd ( qqcd ) ( @xmath28 being the number of colors ) and large-@xmath27 qcd are identical implies that differences in the low - energy constants of these two theories are @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> thus after including quenched chiral logarithms , which are formally higher order in @xmath30 but numerically enhanced by the smallness of light quark masses , one can hope that a qqcd calculation will have a @xmath31 error . however , for cases such as the proton strange magnetic moment , the higher order @xmath30 corrections are likely to be important due to accidental cancellations at leading order ( lo ) . in this work we present the chiral expansion of several nucleon strange matrix elements up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) ( i.e. @xmath32 ) in both @xmath12pt and pq@xmath12pt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pq@xmath12pt is presently the only tool that can rigorously remove ( partial ) quenching errors without performing fully unquenched simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the pq@xmath12pt calculations using two non - degenerate light - quark masses in the hope of providing an extra `` handle '' to aid in the extraction of strange matrix elements in the nucleon from lattice data . </S>"
