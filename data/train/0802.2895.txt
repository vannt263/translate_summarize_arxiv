    "g45.45@xmath00.06 is a luminous ultra  compact ( uc ) region identified by @xcite as a `` cometary '' type in their landmark radio survey .",
    "uc regions have become synonymous with the earliest phases of massive star birth @xcite and the phase in which the object is first revealed as an identifiable hot , massive star as evidenced by its strong ionizing radiation .",
    "@xcite noted that many of the uc regions must be excited by multiple sources , in effect harboring clusters of stars .",
    "this has indeed turned out to be the case .",
    "@xcite presented high angular resolution near infrared images of g45.45@xmath00.06 that showed multiple point sources and a complex morphology .",
    "we have used the new near  infrared integral  field spectrograph ( nifs ) on the gemini north fredrick c. gillett 8m telescope to carry out a detailed investigation of this uc region and build on the @xcite imaging study .",
    "uc regions typically have sizes 0.1 pc . at the distance of g45.45@xmath00.06 (",
    "* kpc ) this scale just fills the nifs three arc second field . using the facility adaptive optics module altair with nifs , we obtained @xmath2 0.1@xmath3 images in several pointings in the larger @xcite field .",
    "adaptive optics on large aperture telescopes offers a significant advance in the study of massive stars in their earliest phases since the high angular resolution improves the point source contrast against the strong and variable nebular background .",
    "nifs has the added benefit of a new generation 2048@xmath42048 hgcdte array that provides broad spectral coverage ( an entire near  infrared band ) at medium spectral resolution ( @xmath5 5000 ) .",
    "previous studies of uc region central ionizing sources in the near  infrared have identified hot stars @xcite by their photospheric features .",
    "these studies provide important constraints on the statistics of the youngest phase of massive stellar populations .",
    "coupling such studies to integral ",
    "field observations will advance our understanding of the embedded stellar sources as well , but the added high angular resolution imaging dimension will allow for detailed modeling of ionized ( and molecular ) gas as well as the clustering characteristics on the smallest scales . @xcite",
    "have presented results for the galactic uc region [ dbs2003]8 based on similar observations to those described here and made with the eso vlt sinfoni integral  field unit spectrograph .",
    "data were obtained with nifs at the cassegrain focus of the gemini north fredrick c. gillett 8m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii on the nights of 22 and 23 july , 2006 ( local time ) .",
    "nifs was used with the facility adaptive optics ( ao ) module altair in natural guide star ( ngs ) mode .",
    "nifs slices an approximately three arc second by three arc second field into 29 spectral segments of 0.1@xmath3 width ( the `` slit '' width ) and @xmath2 three arc seconds in length.the scale along the spatial dimension is 0.043@xmath3 pix@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting `` spaxels '' are thus 0.043@xmath3 @xmath4 0.1@xmath3 , and each contains a full spectrum covering one of the near  infrared bands .",
    "see @xcite for a complete description of nifs .    in the present case ,",
    "@xmath1band spectra are presented for g45.45@xmath00.6 for two pointings from the field described by @xcite .",
    "the two pointings were chosen to include candidate ionizing sources identified by @xcite.the ao guide star used for altair is located about 12@xmath3 to the north and east from the two nifs pointings .",
    "the ao guide star has an @xmath7 magnitude of 11.8 according to the usno catalog ( source i d : u0975_14397240 ) .",
    "the conditions were sufficient with the ao correction to isolate all the point sources identified by @xcite within the nifs field of view . on the 22nd of july ,",
    "the sky was clear , and the seeing ( at 5000  ) during the observations ( pointing 1 ) was approximately 0.6@xmath8 , and the observations were obtained at relatively high airmass ( 1.61.9 ) .",
    "altair was run at 500 hz for these observations . on july 23rd",
    ", there were thin clouds and the seeing was again about 0.6@xmath9 but this time for an observation airmass near 1.0 ( pointing 2 ) .",
    "altair was run at 100 hz for these observations due to the clouds",
    ".    each pointing consisted of a set of undithered frames taken on source as well as a sky frame obtained on a nearby ( @xmath2 50@xmath3 west ) blank field .",
    "the pointings had total exposure times of 1800 seconds ( 3@xmath4600s ) on source and 600 seconds on sky . at the time of the observations , shortly after nifs commissioning",
    ", it was judged best to stare on source to simplify combining of the frames in the post ",
    "observation reduction .",
    "nifs has a 2048@xmath42048 hgcdte detector ( hawaii2rg ) with a significant number of hot pixels that were removed by sky subtraction .",
    "current nifs observations are best taken with small dithers to help reduce the effect of the hot pixels . the relatively long exposures used to reach near  sky  noise  limited performance also result in significant numbers of cosmic rays",
    ". these can be mitigated by multiple exposures as well .",
    "the nifs dark current is quite low , apart from hot pixels , and is measured to be 0.1 e@xmath10 s@xmath6 .",
    "the rms read noise is approximately six e@xmath11 in low noise mode which uses multiple reads of the detector .",
    "the spectral resolving power of nifs in the @xmath1band is @xmath12 5160 which results in a linear dispersion of 2.13  / pixel .",
    "this dispersion , combined with the large format array gives a full wavelength coverage at @xmath13 of about 4200   accounting for some minor truncation in the final data cube due to the systematic shift of wavelength in each slitlet from the staircase design of the image slicer .",
    "the line maps and spectra presented here were obtained using the gemini nifs iraf data reduction package ( version 1.9 ) .",
    "the nifs iraf package allows for full reduction to the `` image cube '' stage where a finalcube has a roughly 60@xmath462 pixel image plane and a 2040 pixel spectral depth .",
    "first , raw images are prepared for reduction by standard gemini procedures that create the fits image variance and data quality extensions .",
    "next , the data are sky subtracted , flatfielded , rectified spatially , and wavelength calibrated .",
    "the last two steps result in a uniform spatial  spectral trace for each image slice row and a linear wavelength scale .",
    "it is important to remember that the final iraf data cube resamples each slitlet to two 0.05@xmath3 pixels for convenience ; the angular resolution in this dimension is still 0.1@xmath3 . it might be possible to enhance the resolution in the slitlet spatial dimmension by careful dithering of the telescope and combining of the data , but this is not the default situation for nifs that provides native 0.048@xmath3 @xmath4 0.1@xmath3 `` pixels '' on the sky .",
    "the spatial rectification was accomplished by use of a ronchi mask image taken as part of the baseline calibration set for nifs .",
    "the ronchi mask is a coarse transmission grating deployed in the instrument focal plane and illuminated by the flatfield calibration lamp .",
    "it produces a uniform distribution of compact artifical sources along each image slice . in the spatial dimension ,",
    "the ronchi mask produces nine spectral traces for each slice .",
    "each trace can be thought of as the trace of a point source at a given spatial position of each slice .",
    "fitting the traces for all slices primarily removes a small systematic ( @xmath2 @xmath14 one pixel end  to  end ) slope of the spectral trace and allows for an accurate reconstruction of the 2d image since the traces of one slice can be identified with the traces of neighboring slices .    a lamp image of ar and xe lines was used to determine the dispersion along each slice and as a function of the spatial dimension of each slice .",
    "a quadratic polynomial was used in this case which produced typical uncertainties in the position of a spectral line of approximately @xmath14 0.2   ( @xmath2 1/10 pixel ) .",
    "final spectra are interpolated to a linear wavelength solution .",
    "the spectra were next corrected for telluric absorption by division by the spectrum of an a0 v star .",
    "each a0 v ( in this case hip84147 and hip89309 on july 22 and hip99796 on july 23 ) was corrected for intrinsic br@xmath15 absorption by fitting a voigt profile to the telluric spectrum .",
    "this approximate correction is sufficient for our purposes since the hot star photospheric classifications do not rely on br@xmath15 .",
    "the fully rectified and telluric corrected images were used to extract point sources using the nfextract routine . in the gemini iraf nifs package , the point source extraction is done on the image that still contains the 29 slices , i.e. before construction of a final data cube image ( the extraction aperture is applied to a temporary cube ) . in this case , the nfextract routine was modified to allow for a secondary sky spectrum to be subtracted from the point source to account for over or under  subtraction of sky between the on  source and sky images . in both g45.45@xmath00.06 pointings , a one arc second diameter aperture was used to measure the residual sky emission .",
    "this aperture obviously includes some nebular emission , but the sky aperture location was chosen to minimize this effect . for pointing 1 , this was a location to the south and west of the point sources near the edge of the image ( see below ) . for pointing 2 ,",
    "the sky aperture was located to the north and west of the point sources near the edge of the image .",
    "all point sources were extracted using a 0.4@xmath3 diameter aperture .",
    "this aperture was chosen to minimize the overlap between point sources while attempting to obtain as much flux as possible and is distinguished from the larger aperture used for flux calibration ( see next ) that was chosen to match the photometry of @xcite .",
    "the final wavelength calibrated , spatially rectified , and telluric corrected images were transformed into data cubes .",
    "the spatial pixel scale was interpolated to 0.05@xmath3 in the fine dimension and block replicated to 0.05@xmath3 in the course dimension providing for a uniform scale as described in the previous section .",
    "line maps presented below were extracted from these cubes using nfmap .",
    "a rough flux calibration was done by extracting spectra in 0.5@xmath3 apertures and comparing them to the photometry of @xcite from the same diameter aperture ( source `` o '' in pointing 1 , and sources `` g '' , ",
    "i  , and `` k '' in pointing two ) . no attempt was made to correct the fraction of light outside this aperture in the seeing halo for this approximate flux calibration .",
    "making an aperture correction on the science frames is not possible because of the strong nebular emission ; however , the standard stars taken before and after the science observations ( under similar seeing as the science targets ) suggest that a 0.5@xmath3 diameter aperture misses at least 25@xmath16 of the stellar flux .",
    "the following results and discussion do not depend strongly on the absolute calibration of the nifs data .",
    "this calibration applies only to the extended emission maps presented below ; point sources are calibrated directly to the @xcite @xmath17 magnitudes ( @xmath182.12 ) using a flux zero point of 4.75@xmath410@xmath19 erg @xmath20-s@xmath6-@xmath6 .",
    "this gives @xmath21 ( @xmath22 @xmath13 ) @xmath23 12.4 and 12.0 mag for sources `` m '' and `` n '' , respectively .",
    "figures  [ 217a ] and [ 217b ] show continuum emission for pointings one and two , respectively , extracted from the final data cubes .",
    "the wavelength for the extracted band is 21695  , and the band is approximately 10.7   wide .",
    "the point sources in these images have image cores of about 0.15@xmath3 - 0.25@xmath3 .",
    "this is for a final set of three combined images .",
    "the point source designations of @xcite are indicated in each figure , and all of them are clearly and easily separated , even though they are deeply embedded in strong nebular emission from the uc region .",
    "a faint source not identified by @xcite appears about 0.5@xmath3 south of source `` h '' in figure  [ 217b ] ; we designate this source `` hs '' .",
    "point source spectra are shown in figures  [ otype][co ] .",
    "@xcite sources `` m '' and `` n '' exhibit photospheric features of mid  early o  type stars @xcite . though the telluric correction is relatively poor near 20600  , there appears to be weak emission at 20796   and perhaps at 20842   in both sources ( vacuum line positions from * ? ? ?",
    "the former line is stronger , as is typical @xcite .",
    "the presence of emission near 20800   together with the strong [ absorption ] and [ emission ] features indicates a spectral type earlier than about ko6 and later than about ko4 .",
    "sources `` k '' and `` o '' have co overtone emission starting with the 20 rotational ",
    "vibrational bandhead at 22935  .",
    "these sources do not show obvious photospheric features .",
    "there is a suggestion of weak and broad absorption at the postion of br@xmath15 in the spectrum of source `` k ; ''",
    "however , it is not possible to claim an unambiguous detection due to the strong nebular emission seen toward source `` k '' and the ( imperfect ) correction of br@xmath15 absorption in the telluric standard .",
    "apart from co bandhead emission , sources `` k '' and  o  exhibit strong continuum emission and overlying , compact , nebular emission .",
    "sources `` h '' , `` i '' , and ",
    "show only nebular features superimposed upon a red continuum .",

    "figure  [ cozoom ] shows the region of source `` g '' around the region of the co 20 rotational ",

    "br@xmath15 ( 21661  ) and he i ( 20587   and 21127  ) lines are strong as expected for an region with embedded hot stars .",
    "figure  [ brg ] shows the distribution of ionized gas in each pointing along with an overlay of the contours of the continuum emission .",
    "the continuum band is centered near 21700   and it highlights the positions of the point sources relative to the ionized gas .",

    "subtracted br@xmath15 map for pointing 1 that is near to , but not quite centered on , the position of source `` l '' .",
    "the ionized gas appears to form a sharp ridge in pointing two centered on the line of ( presumably ) embedded point sources , though the point sources appear systematically offset to the south as the ridge is traversed from east to west .",
    "the peak br@xmath15 fluxes in each pointing are consistent with the narrow  band map presented by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of he i ( 21127  ) to br@xmath15 is roughly uniform over both pointings and equal to about 0.035 @xmath14 0.003 ( not corrected for reddening ) .    two lines present in the data cubes have been identified previously in planetary nebulae ( pne ) spectra .",
    "these are the lines at 21986   and 22867   that were attributed to [ ] and [ ] , respectively , in spectra of pne by @xcite .",

    "scale maps for both of these lines in each pointing ( pointing 1 , bottom ; pointing 2 , top ) .",
    "each map is overlaid with the br@xmath15 contour , and it appears that the 21986   and 22867   lines trace the ionized gas region .",
    "all the lines detected are identified in table  1 .",
    "the line intensities with respect to br@xmath15 are similar in both pointings and all lines in the table were detected in both pointings .",
    "@xcite used adaptive optics imaging at near  infrared wavelengths ( @xmath24 , and @xmath17 in conjunction with lower angular resolution radio and mid  infrared images to describe the evolutionary state of the uc region and its massive stars . though their 4m telescope data were still of insufficient resolution to make accurate photometric measurements of the bright trio of sources `` l '' , `` m '' , and",
    "`` n '' , they speculated that these sources were the more massive ionizing objects embedded in g45.45@xmath00.06 and had formed first , triggering a second star formation event along the ridge of ionizing emission that gives this uc its original cometary designation @xcite .",
    "our nifs spectra of sources `` m '' and `` n '' confirm the first part of this scenario , at least .",
    "the two sources are hot , massive stars as identified by their photospheric features ( figure  [ otype ] ) .",
    "g45.45@xmath00.06 is thus one of only a few uc regions with spectroscopically confirmed central ionizing sources of the hottest spectral types @xcite , though identification of central stars in uc regions of mid o , late o , and early b types is now relatively common @xcite .",
    "along with the o  type stars , we have detected co bandhead emission in sources `` o '' and `` k '' .",
    "this feature has been associated with massive young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "the brightness of source `` k '' ( @xmath25 14.1 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests it might be a hot star if its @xmath26 color were the result of reddening only",
    ". however , candidate massive stars with co emission typically have strong excess emission due to reprocessing of the central star radiation by the circumstellar disk and/or envelope .",
    "it is more likely that the co emission sources we observe in g45.45@xmath00.06 are somewhat lower mass objects than the identified o  type stars and have not yet dispersed their natal cocoons as in w31 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for an extended discussion of the near  infrared excess emission observed around young hot stars with co emission .",
    "the location of the co emission sources and the apparently embedded sources `` g '' , `` h '' , and `` i '' outside the central `` cluster '' of o stars is consistent with a picture as described by @xcite in which the o stars have triggered further star formation . however , as mentioned above , such embedded objects usually appear bright at @xmath13 due to strong excess emission ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps due to an accretion disk .",
    "the expected @xmath13 excess for objects with reprocessing disks can be quite large ( 24 mag ) with a corresponding reduction in the resulting mass / luminosity @xcite . the disk ( or envelope ) dissipation time is longer for lower masses , so the issue of which stars formed when is unresolved .",
    "the strongest argument for triggered star formation remains the morphology of the sources embedded in the uc region .",
    "the source `` g '' appears to be the most heavily embedded source and the ionized gas systematically becomes separated from the point sources along the ne ",
    "sw ridge of emission as one moves toward source `` k '' to the sw ( see figure  [ brg ] ) .",
    "the impression is that the hot stars `` m '' and `` n '' to the se are ionizing this ridge and that if they are responsible for triggering the star formation events associated with the embedded sources , then perhaps source `` k '' formed first and has evolved slightly as the ionization front moves outward . alternately , the lower mass stars have formed at the same time , but around the central high mass stars .",
    "the uc region is powered by more than one massive star , and there are a number of lower mass hot ( presumably b  type ) stars as indicated by the nifs spectroscopy .",
    "the exciting `` star '' of this uc region is , in fact , a cluster , as pointed out by @xcite ; the nifs data now provide a more quantitative description of the stellar content .",
    "this includes lower mass stars : figure  [ cozoom ] suggests we have detected a cool  star component .",
    "the region of the spectrum near and beyond 23000   shows what appears to be bandhead absorption due to the co molecule .",
    "the signal is strongest in the aperture around source `` g '' and it is not clear if source `` g '' itself is responsible for all the absorption or if there are one or more cooler stars very close to an otherwise more massive star .",
    "the strong pfund series emission complicates the situation and is also contributing to the appearance of a lower `` continuum '' beyond 23000   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , a strong feature appears at the wavelength of the co feature which does not have the smooth character expected for the psuedo continuum produced only by pfund series lines running together .    apertures with no obvious point source do not convincingly show a co absorption signal , though any such signal should be weak . @xcite",

    "main sequence ( pms ) stars in massive clusters of @xmath2 myr age . for lower resolution spectra ( @xmath27 @xmath28 1000 )",
    ", they find co bandhead absorption strengths of about one percent in integrated light .",
    "our spectrum at higher resolution shows an absorption strength at 22935   of about five percent .",
    "atomic features are also weak in the @xcite spectra ( 1 @xmath16 ) and consistent with non  detections in our spectra ( that have s / n @xmath2 50 ) .",
    "the low  mass signal depends on the amount of nebular emission ( which degrades it ) and age ( younger pms stars are brighter and have stronger features ) . the fact that we appear to detect low  mass stars in g45.45@xmath00.06 suggests the cluster is quite young . future work on modeling the low  mass component in uc regions might provide more quantitative age information than has been available to date for the associated massive stars .",
    "precise ages are key to understanding disk dissipation and triggering time scales as mentioned above .",
    "the spectral type assignment made in   3 for sources `` m '' and `` n '' is accurate to a few sub  types .",
    "the infrared spectral type may be associated with optical types and an effective temperature determined for the stars .",
    "previous estimates of the temperature vs. spectral type @xcite would give @xmath29 @xmath22 44000 k to 48000 k ( by association with the optical spectral types ) .",
    "recent work using line  blanketed atmospheres @xcite has resulted in the effective  temperature scale `` cooling '' so that these optical spectral types would give lower effective temperatures : @xmath29 @xmath22 39000 k to 43000 k , a significant change .",
    "@xcite used line blanketed models to derive o star effective temperatures directly from near  infrared and optical spectra .",
    "it is found that the effective temperatures are generally in good agreement for derivations using near  infrared and optical spectra .",
    "@xcite report @xmath30 @xmath23 42000 and 45000 derived from fits to near  infrared spectra for an o4v star and o3v star , respectively .",
    "we thus expect the effective temperature for sources `` m '' and `` n '' to lie within the range given by @xcite , i.e. about @xmath29 @xmath23 41000 k @xmath14 2500 k.    the observed emission  line and dust properties of g45.45@xmath00.06 can also be used to constrain the effective temperature of exciting source(s ) .",

    "the coolest ( 28000 k ) does not exhibit the lines , but several with temperatures in the @xmath2 6000080000 k range do show the lines and with similar ratios to br@xmath15 as given in table  1 ( i.e. , few percent ) .",
    "@xcite have embarked on a large survey of pne for which they are doing detailed photo  ionization modeling .",
    "they report results for a set of 10 pne that they are using to calibrate the atomic data for kr and se that are somewhat uncertain . in any case , they have observed several cooler pne ( 37000 , 56000 k ) .",
    "neither of these cool pne exhibits both [ ] and [ ] , but each exhibits one of the lines , and in similar ratio to br@xmath15 as found in this work for g45.45@xmath00.06 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the abundances of kr and se appear to be enhanced in many , but not all pne with respect to the solar value ( see * ? ? ? * for preliminary results of the large pne survey ) .",
    "the presence of two relatively high  excitation lines ( [ ] 21986   and [ ] 22867  ) was unexpected given that these lines have been identified in pne of fairly high excitation , and are not typical of regions . however , search of the literature shows that these `` unidentified '' lines have been detected in a number of regions even though the explicit association with [ ] and [ ] had not been made .",
    "@xcite suggested they may have detected both unidentified lines in their low resolution spectrum of g45.12@xmath00.13 , but could not confidently separate the 21986   line from h@xmath43 .",
    "@xcite derived an excitation temperature in g45.12@xmath00.13 between 38000 k and 42000 k. @xcite studied the same uc region , irs2 in w51 as did @xcite , and detected the [ ] line .",
    "it appears the [ ] line is also present though again blended with h@xmath43 32 ( s3 ) line ( this is evident when comparing the `` excess '' level population at the energy corresponding to an upper level of 19086k ; see their figure 4 and table 5 ) .",
    "better angular resolution may be the reason @xcite were able to identify the line while @xcite did not .",
    "another possibility is differences in the detailed slit positioning in / around irs2 .",
    "@xcite detected the lines in a spectrum of the object irs  1 that is near the exciting source ggd27irs of both hh80 and hh81 ( but otherwise not related ) .",
    "@xcite noted the possible association of the lines with those seen by @xcite .",
    "it is not clear what type of object might be exciting irs 1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the `` unidentified '' line at 21986   has also been detected in the extragalactic giant region ngc 5461 .",
    "@xcite note the h@xmath43 32 s(3 ) line is blended with a line they associate with the unidentified line cited by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath1band spectra for a sample of uc regions , but do not mention detection of either of these two lines .",
    "their spectral coverage ran out near the 22867   line , but one of their spectra of a `` typical '' uc region ( see their figure 1 ) shows a line near 21986   that may be due to [ ] .",
    "@xcite also surveyed a number of uc regions , but their spectra do not cover the two line positions .",
    "@xcite investigated deeply embedded point sources in compact regions ; their spectra do not show evidence of either line , but it is likely these sources are of lower effective temperature typical of early b  type and late o  type stars .",
    "blum and collaborators @xcite have surveyed giant regions using @xmath1band spectroscopy , but they also do not report detections of these two lines ; a number of their spectra also do not cover the line regions .",
    "the lack of sufficient wavelength coverage has been due to the trade off in instrumental spectral resolution .",
    "surveys for massive stars usually tend to the blue end of the @xmath1band to cover the o  type star diagnostic lines .",
    "most of the investigations mentioned above have also concentrated on the point source spectroscopy of candidate massive stars and not the overall nebular spectrum of the regions and objects surveyed .    the ionization potentials for and are 24.4 ev and 30.8 ev , respectively @xcite .",
    "this is well within the range of the ionizing continuum of the hotter o  type stars , particularly for .",
    "figure  [ teff ] shows the ionizing continua of hot stars for a range of effective temperatures and two sets of models .",
    "plane parallel , hydrostatic models are plotted @xcite along with line blanketed wind models @xcite .",
    "both show significant numbers of ionizing photons for the hotter stars and a rapid decrease in ionizing photons in the range appropriate to form and as the effective temperature falls .",
    "wavelengths corresponding to the ionization potentials of and are shown as vertical dashed lines .",
    "while the presence of these two lines is not ubiquitous in region spectra , it seems that the hotter o stars , in dense uc regions , can produce these lines .",
    "the distribution of the emission within the uc follows the ionized gas as shown in the maps of figure  [ brg ] and [ krsel ] . our unpublished nifs data for the uc region g5.89@xmath410.39 show strong emission at 21986   and possibly weaker emission at the [ ] position toward the center of the uc region .",
    "we were unable to identify the exciting source in this case , but the excitation as given by the hei to br@xmath15 ratio and br@xmath15 to dust ratio appears similar to that for g45.45@xmath00.06 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the g5.89@xmath410.39 data is in progress . given the ionization potentials of the parent ions to the species responsible for these lines and the strong gradient in the ionizing continuum hardness of the o stars , we believe that these lines will only be produced in dense regions with the hottest ionizing stars .",
    "nifs 3-dimensional imaging spectroscopy is presented for two pointings toward the uc region g45.45@xmath00.06 .",
    "the central ionizing sources of g45.45@xmath00.06 have been identified as massive o  type stars through comparison of their @xmath1band spectra to template o star spectra .",
    "the @xcite sources `` m '' and `` n '' are found to be of o spectral types earlier than about ko6 .",
    "in addition , two other @xcite sources , `` k '' and `` o '' , exhibit co bandhead emission near 23000   indicating that they are massive young stellar objects . in analogy to other similar objects in other regions , these two massive young stellar objects likely have significant @xmath1 band excesses and thus have central stars consistent with late o and early b stars . the remaining @xcite sources in the nifs fields ( `` l '' , `` g '' , `` h '' , and `` i '' ) show strong compact nebular emission and rising red continua suggesting that they too are massive young stellar objects .",
    "the nifs images reveal complex nebular structure and precise emission line maps .",
    "the morphology of the uc region suggests that the central hot stars have triggered star formation in the material to the north west as represented by point sources `` g '' , `` h '' , `` i '' , and `` k '' and also to the south in the form of source `` o '' .",
    "however , there is no way to precisely assign ages to these sources relative to the central ionizing stars that are presumably on , or near , the zero age main sequence .",
    "modeling the weak signal from low  mass pre ",
    "main sequence stars may provide a much needed clock for high  mass starforming regions . a low  mass signal is present in the nifs data for g45.45@xmath00.06 , though it is not clear if it is associated with one or a few low  mass objects .",
    "an alternate scenario is that the massive stars form in the cluster center and lower mass stars form around them at the same time .",
    "lines of doubly ionized kr and triply ionized se are detected in the nifs spectra .",
    "line maps show that these lines follow the ionized gas in the uc region as traced by br@xmath15 and hei .",
    "the lines are not common in regions , but have been identified in planetary nebulae ( pne ) where the central stars are typically much hotter .",
    "in fact , one or the other or both of the lines , while not previously identified with and , have been detected in a number of compact regions .",
    "the line , in particular , is blended with h@xmath43 32 s(3 ) at lower spectral resolution making its identification more difficult .    these are @xmath42process lines that show enhanced abundances over the solar value for some , but not all , pne .",
    "we suggest that it may be only the regions excited by the hottest o stars and with high density that can produce these lines .",
    "if so , the lines may be a useful new diagnostic on the effective temperature of ionizing stars in regions .",
    "much of the observational data in the literature are incomplete with respect to wavelength coverage for the detection of these lines in a wide range of regions , and the atomic parameters of the ions of kr and se are not yet well established , but progress is being made on both fronts .",
    "we acknowledge the helpful comments of an anonymous referee .",
