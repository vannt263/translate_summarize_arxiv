    "heavy fermion ( hf ) materials in strongly correlated @xmath4-electron systems have attracted much attention over the last two decades because of their interesting physical properties .",
    "@xcite until now , numerous rare earth hf compounds have been found , however , most of them are trivalent ce(@xmath5)- or yb(@xmath6)-based systems with kramers doublet ground states .",
    "there have been intense experimental researches to investigate new exotic phenomena in @xmath7 systems mainly on u - compounds .",
    "one of interesting characteristics predicted for @xmath7 systems is the quadrupolar kondo phenomena theoretically proposed by cox to explain the non - fermi - liquid behaviors observed in several u - compounds with non - magnetic crystal electric field ( cef ) ground state .",
    "@xcite however , most of u - compounds are not suitable to be described by the cef scheme because of the highly itinerant nature of 5@xmath4-electrons . on the contrary , for most pr - compounds",
    ", strong hybridization effect is hardly expected due to the localized character of 4@xmath4-electrons .",
    "in fact , kondo - like behaviors have been observed in limited pr - compounds , such as prsn@xmath8 and prinag@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite for the latter , really large sommerferd coefficient of @xmath10 j / k@xmath11mol , comparable with those reported for the typical ce- or u - heavy fermion compounds , has been reported .",
    "however , no direct evidence of the highly enhanced effective mass has been obtained , since the sample with high enough quality to detect the dhva signals has not been prepared .",
    "ternary intermetallic compounds rt@xmath12x@xmath1 ( r = rare earth ; t = fe , ru , and os ; x = p , as , and sb ) with the filled skutterudite structure ( im3 ) show a rich variety of electrical and magnetic properties depending on the components r , t , and x.  @xcite among them , prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 is the most interesting compound because of the apparent kondo - like behaviors found in the transport properties and specific heat @xmath13 which are not expected for the well localized 4@xmath4-electron system .",
    "@xcite figure  [ r&c / t ] shows the temperature @xmath14 dependence of ( a ) electrical resistivity @xmath15 and ( b ) specific heat divided by temperature @xmath16 .     and ( b ) specific heat divided by temperature @xmath16 in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "the dashed lines in both figures are the phonon contribution estimated from lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 data . ]    the apparent @xmath17 dependence of @xmath15 above @xmath1830  k and also the large magnitude of thermoelectric power at low @xmath14 ( @xmath19 above 6.5  k ) suggest dominant contribution from the kondo effect .",
    "@xcite existence of highly correlated electrons is manifest in the behaviors of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the high field state above the metamagnetic transition field @xmath205.5  t. under 10  t , @xmath15 follows @xmath21 [ see the inset in fig .  [ r&c / t ] ( a ) ] below @xmath182  k with a large value of @xmath22cm / k@xmath23 . in the specific heat measurement under 6  t , @xmath16 increases with decreasing @xmath14 and saturates below @xmath182  k to an anomalously large value of @xmath24  j / k@xmath11mol . an upturn at lower @xmath14 is the nuclear schottky contribution @xmath25 mostly due to pr nuclei . by subtracting @xmath26 ,",
    "we have estimated the electronic contribution @xmath27 at 0  k as 0.10 , 0.13 , and @xmath28  j / k@xmath11mol under 0 , 4 , and 6  t , respectively .",
    "note that the large @xmath29-value above @xmath30 along with the @xmath31-constant follows the kadowaki - woods relation indicating a typical hf behavior .",
    "@xcite it is of interest to clarify the origin of the unusual hf behaviors in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 .    another anomalous nature is the phase transition at 6.5  k below which the hall effect measurement revealed a carrier reduction indicating the fermi surface ( fs ) reconstruction .",
    "@xcite the transition was first ascribed to the superzone gap formation associated with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition .",
    "@xcite however , in the recent neutron scattering experiment ,  @xcite no bragg peak expected for an af ordering has been detected below 6.5  k , suggesting the ordered state to be non - magnetic , consistent with the non - magnetic cef ground state ( either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) inferred from the anisotropy in the magnetization [ @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite that is further supported by the small upper bound of the pr - magnetic moment ( @xmath35 ) estimated from the small pr - nuclear contribution to the specific heat under 0  t.  @xcite the softening of the elastic constants @xmath36 and ( @xmath37 below @xmath1830  k reported in the recent ultrasonic measurement also suggests the cef ground state to be non - magnetic @xmath33 and the phase transition to be an antiferro - quadrupolar ordering .",
    "@xcite    all these facts point to the possibility of quadrupolar kondo effect in prfe@xmath12p@xmath1 competing with the quadrupolar ordering",
    ". the dhva experiment can be the most powerful tool to clarify the unusual hf state in this exotic pr - compound ; to obtain direct evidence of highly enhanced effective mass and to study most precisely the electronic structure such as fs . in this paper ,",
    "we report the first successful dhva effect both in the low field ordered phase ( lop ) and the high field phase ( hfp ) .",
    "the preliminary report for the dhva experiments have been published .",
    "single crystals of prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 and lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 were grown by the tin - flux method basically same as described in ref.6 .",
    "the raw materials were 4n ( 99.99% pure)-pr , -la , -fe , 6n - p , and 5n - sn .",
    "the crystal structure was verified by the x - ray powder diffraction measurement . the lattice constant @xmath38    is close to the reported value .",
    "@xcite the dhva experiments were performed in a 17 t superconducting magnet with a top loading dilution refrigerator system cooled down to 28 mk .",
    "the dhva signals were detected by means of the conventional field modulation method with a low frequency ( @xmath39  hz ) .",
    "figure  [ prfe4p12dhva_osc&fft ] shows ( a ) typical recorder traces of the dhva oscillations for selected field directions and ( b ) corresponding fourier spectra , where @xmath40 is a tilting field angle from [ 001 ] to [ 101 ] in ( 010 ) .    p@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are fundamental dhva frequency branches and 2@xmath42 is the 2nd harmonic of @xmath42 .",
    "a remarkable feature is a reduction of the dhva signal amplitude with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "the insets show the evolution of oscillations of the @xmath42- and @xmath43-branches and the vanishing of the @xmath44-branch in the hfp . ]",
    "the three dhva branches @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 were observed only above @xmath30 , while the branch @xmath44 was observed only below @xmath30 ( see the insets ) , which implies a large change in fs across @xmath30 .",
    "the branches @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 are observed in the limited angular range centered at @xmath50 , and could not be detected around @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath44-branch is observed in the whole angular range in @xmath53 .",
    "assuming a spherical fs for this branch ( the volume of fs is only 0.15% of the 1st brillouin zone size ) , the carrier number is estimated to be @xmath54 which is close to @xmath55 estimated from the hall coefficient .",
    "@xcite the rough agreement between the estimated carrier numbers could be understood , since lighter carriers ( holes in the present case ) give dominant contribution to the hall coefficient in the low fields .",
    "the drastic reduction of the @xmath29-value in the lop is explained by the carrier reduction associated with the fs reconstruction .",
    "however , the sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath29=5  mj / k@xmath11mol estimated from the @xmath44-branch assuming a spherical fs with 10  @xmath56 is still smaller than the experimental @xmath57100  mj / k@xmath11mol .",
    "according to the nesting model ,  @xcite prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 loses a large part of fs and becomes a semimetal in lop .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the antiferro - quadrupolar transition associated with the fs instability with a nesting vectors @xmath58  ( 1,0,0 ) .",
    "@xcite there should be heavier electron - like fs(s ) ( @xmath59 ) that compensates the observed hole - like fs and dominates the observed @xmath29-value in lop .",
    "the dhva experiments have directly proved the extraordinary enhancement of effective mass @xmath2 [ see fig .",
    "[ fielddepmass&freq ]  ( a ) ] which gives the first unquestionable evidence for the heavy fermion state in pr - based compounds ; the @xmath45 is almost comparable with the reported heaviest masses of 120  @xmath56 for ceru@xmath60si@xmath60 and 105  @xmath56 for upt@xmath61",
    ".  @xcite that is consistent with the large @xmath29-value and the kondo - like features in the transport properties .",
    "a noticeable feature in the @xmath45 is the large anisotropy as shown in fig .",
    "[ angdepmass ] ; it gradually increases with increasing @xmath40 except for @xmath44-branch .",
    "such a behavior is expected for a cylindrical fs along [ 001 ] .      however , this is not the case , since the @xmath45 increases while the cross - sectional area decreases with increasing @xmath40 at least for @xmath42-branch as shown in fig .",
    "[ prfe4p12dhva_ang ] .",
    "such an anisotropic @xmath45 , especially for the cubic system , suggests unusual anisotropic mass renormalization .",
    "the most interesting subject is the origin of the mass enhancement , since the cef ground state is believed to be a non - magnetic @xmath33 .",
    "the mass enhancement in hfp and kondo - like behaviors at high temperatures could be ascribed to the conventional kondo effect associated with the magnetic cef exited states ; the proposed cef level scheme is @xmath62 ,  @xcite where the interaction between thermally induced magnetic moments and conduction electrons can bring about the kondo effect due to the small excited energy ( @xmath1810  k ) .",
    "the rearrangement of cef levels in magnetic field stabilizing a magnetic ground state also could not be ruled out for the conventional kondo effect in hfp .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fielddepmass&freq ]  ( a ) , the @xmath45 of the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 branches are significantly suppressed by the magnetic field as was reported in typical ce - based heavy fermion systems such as ceru@xmath60si@xmath60 ,  @xcite ceb@xmath63 ,  @xcite and cecu@xmath63 .  @xcite      the suppression of @xmath45 is consistent with the reduction of the @xmath29-value by the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite however , the possibility of quadrupolar origin for the large mass in hfp still remains because the cef excited @xmath65 state also has the quadrupole moments . on the contrary ,",
    "the effective mass of @xmath44-branch observed in lop is insensitive against the magnetic field , which is also consistent with the almost constant @xmath29-value in lop .",
    "@xcite these facts point to the non - magnetic origin of the large mass enhancement in this materials at least in lop .",
    "the fluctuating quadrupolar moments which interact with conduction electrons could be responsible for the hf properties .",
    "another unexpected feature in fig .",
    "[ prfe4p12dhva_ang ] is a difference in the fs topology between prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 and lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "if the 4@xmath4-electrons are well localized in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 , the fs should be close to that of lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 at least in the hfp ( or field induced ferromagnetic state ) above @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the fs of ferromagnetic ndfe@xmath0p@xmath1 was confirmed to be very close to that of lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 except a small spin - splitting in the dhva frequencies .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fielddepmass&freq ]  ( b ) , apparent field dependence of the dhva frequencies ( @xmath66 ) is observed , at least for @xmath67",
    ". the frequencies for @xmath41- and @xmath43-branches decrease with increasing field , whereas the frequency for @xmath42-branch increases with increasing field .",
    "such a field dependence of dhva frequencies could be explained as due to the spin - splitting effect combined with the non - linear magnetization prosses ,  @xcite if we assume that @xmath41- and @xmath43-branch originate from an up - spin state and @xmath42-branch originates from a down - spin state or vice versa . in the magnetic field ,",
    "the spin degeneracy of conduction electrons is lifted and the each landau energy level is split into the up- and down - spin states by the zeeman effect .",
    "when the spin - splitting of the energy levels is proportional to the magnetic field and thereby the extremal cross - sectional area @xmath68 of each spin state fs changes linearly with increasing field , the dhva frequencies of each spin state coincide , giving the same @xmath68 for zero field . on the other hand , in the magnetic materials ,",
    "the conduction electrons have different zeeman and exchange energies depending on the spin directions .",
    "in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 , the 4@xmath4-moment is induced significantly by the magnetic field and the non - linear magnetization appears in hfp .",
    "@xcite the exchange interaction between the 4@xmath4-electrons and conduction electrons brings about the non - linear field dependence of @xmath68 which is a origin of the large field dependence of dhva frequencies .",
    "thus , a large spin - splitting effect could be an origin of the large difference in the dhva branches between prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 and lafe@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "however , we could obtain no conclusive evidence , since possible branches paired with the observed ones with different spin directions may not have been detected due to their heavy masses exceeding the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "@xcite    the question is why the kondo effect ( either magnetic or non - magnetic ) which is quite unusual in pr - compounds is realized in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "crystallographically , pr - ions located within a large cage made of 12-p and 4-fe ions in the filled skutterudite structure are under following special condition .",
    "relatively large distance between pr- and p - ions leads to the deeper 4@xmath4-level compared to the ordinary rare earth compounds ,  @xcite however , the large coordination number of 12 might fully compensate it and leads to even larger @xmath69-@xmath4 hybridization .",
    "_ `` the unique crystallographic structure could be an origin of such unusual feature in this compound as a pr - compound through an enhanced c - f hybridization effect . '' _    in summary , we confirmed an enormously enhanced effective mass ( the detected maximum value is @xmath2 ) in prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "the insensitivity of mass against the magnetic field suggests non - magnetic origin of the mass enhancement at least in lop whose order parameter to be also non - magnetic origin .",
    "prfe@xmath0p@xmath1 may be a first pr - based compound in which the quadrupolar kondo effect coexists ( or competes ) with quadrupolar ordering .",
