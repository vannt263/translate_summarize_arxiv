    "humans are social beings and our social interactions are often complex . social interactions in many forms produce spontaneous variations manifested as inequalities while at times these inequalities result out of continued complex interactions among the constituent human units .",
    "the availability of a large body of empirical data for a variety of measures from human social interactions has made it possible to uncover the patterns and investigate the reasons for socio - economic inequalities . with tools of statistical physics as a core",
    ", researchers are incorporating the knowledge and techniques from various disciplines  @xcite like statistics , applied mathematics , information theory and computer science for a better understanding of the nature and origin of socio - economic inequalities that shape the humankind .",
    "socio - economic inequality  @xcite is the existence of unequal opportunities and rewards for various social positions or statuses within the society .",
    "it usually contains structured and recurrent patterns of unequal distributions of goods , wealth , opportunities , and even rewards and punishments , and mainly measured in terms of _ inequality of conditions _ , and _ inequality of opportunities_. _ inequality of conditions _ refers to the unequal distribution of income , wealth and material goods .",
    "_ inequality of opportunities _ refers to the unequal distribution of ` life chances ' across individuals .",
    "this is reflected in measures such as level of education , health status , and treatment by the criminal justice system .",
    "socio - economic inequality is responsible for conflict , war , crisis , oppression , criminal activity , political unrest and instability , and indirectly affects economic growth  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , economic inequalities have been studied in the context of income and wealth  @xcite .",
    "the study of inequality in society  @xcite is a topic of current focus and global interest and brings together researchers from various disciplines  economics , sociology , mathematics , statistics , demography , geography , graph theory , computer science and even theoretical physics .",
    "socio - economic inequalities are quantified in various ways .",
    "the most popular measures are absolute , in terms of indices , e.g. , gini  @xcite , theil  @xcite , pietra  @xcite indices .",
    "the alternative approach is a relative measure , in terms of probability distributions of various quantities , but the most of the above mentioned indices can be computed from the distributions .",
    "most quantities often display broad distributions , usually lognormals , power - laws or their combinations .",
    "for example , the distribution of income is usually an exponential followed by a power law  @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for other examples ) .",
    "the lorenz curve  @xcite is function which represents the cumulative proportion @xmath1 of ordered individuals ( from lowest to highest ) in terms of the cumulative proportion of their size @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath1 can represent income or wealth , citation , votes , city population etc .",
    "table  [ tab : xy ] shows the typical examples of @xmath1 and the corresponding @xmath2 .",
    "the gini index ( @xmath3 ) is defined as the ratio between the area enclosed between the lorenz curve and the equality line , and the area below the equality line . if the area between ( i ) the lorenz curve and the equality line is @xmath4 , and ( ii ) that below the lorenz curve is @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ fig : fg_pic_lorenz ] ) , the gini index is given by @xmath6 .",
    "it is an useful measure for quantifying socio - economic inequalities . besides these well - established measures , ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite recently introduced a different measurement called ` @xmath0 index ' ( ` @xmath0 ' stands for the extreme nature of social inequalities in kolkata ) defined as the fraction @xmath0 such that the cumulative income or citations of @xmath7 fraction of people or papers are held by fraction @xmath0 of the people or publications respectively .",

    "in fact , we found six categories of distributions , most of which are a mixture of two distinct distributions with a crossover point . in sec .",

    "we provided numerical evaluations of our measures , and compared their empirical and analytical values . by minimizing the gap between two results obtained in different ways , we provide the estimates of the best possible crossover point for a given data set .",

    "researchers have always concentrated on ( i ) characterizing empirical data and thereby computing inequality measures like gini index , and ( ii ) modeling the origins of broad distributions .",
    "our paper focuses on extensively computing the gini index @xmath3 and the newly introduced @xmath0 index from single analytical distributions or combinations of them , which fit well to empirical data , and also compare the results with those calculated directly from the empirical data sets themselves .",
    "our proposed quantitative methodology to estimate the crossover point between two functional fits to empirical data could also prove to be useful , beyond the realm of inequality research .",
    "while the much studied gini index gives an overall measure of the inequality , the @xmath0 index tells us that the cumulative wealth of @xmath7 fraction of individuals are held by @xmath0 fraction of individuals .",
