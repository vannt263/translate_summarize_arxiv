    "random interlacements offer a microscopic model for the structure left at appropriately chosen time scales by random walks on large recurrent graphs , which are locally transient . in this work",
    "we investigate the percolative properties of random interlacements on transient weighted graphs @xmath11 of the form @xmath0 , where the walk on the weighted graph @xmath1 satisfies certain sub - gaussian estimates governed by two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath12 in @xmath13 $ ] , respectively reflecting the volume growth of @xmath1 , and the diffusive or sub - diffusive nature of the walk on @xmath1 .",
    "random interlacements on the weighted graphs considered in this article occur for instance in the description of the microscopic structure left by random walks on discrete cylinders @xmath14 , with large finite bases @xmath15 , which tend to look like @xmath1 in the vicinity of certain points , when the walk on @xmath14 , runs for times comparable to the square of the number of points in @xmath15 , see @xcite , @xcite . in the spirit of @xcite , they are expected to occur in the description of the microscopic structure left by random walks on suitable sequences of large finite graphs @xmath16 , which tend to look like @xmath11 in the vicinity of certain points , when the walk runs for times proportional to the number of points in @xmath16 .    here , our main interest lies in the percolative properties of @xmath17 the vacant set at level @xmath18 of random interlacements on @xmath11 , as @xmath19 varies .",
    "this set is the complement in @xmath11 of the trace of the trajectories with labels at most @xmath18 in the interlacement point process .",
    "these percolative properties are naturally related to various disconnection and fragmentation problems , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for instance in the case of random walks on the cylinders @xmath20 , with @xmath7 , one can construct couplings of the trace in a box of size @xmath21 of the complement of the trajectory of the walk after completion of a suitable number of excursions to the vicinity of the box , with the vacant set of random interlacements in a box of size @xmath22 in @xmath23 , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these couplings enable one to show that the disconnection time @xmath24 of the cylinder by the walk has precise order @xmath25 .",
    "they also suggest a candidate limit distribution for @xmath26 as @xmath27 goes to infinity , which brings into play the critical parameter @xmath4 for the percolation of @xmath17 , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "proving that such a limit holds presently rests on being able to sharpen controls on the percolative properties of @xmath17 when @xmath18 is fixed but possibly close to @xmath4 . in the case of random walks on @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,",
    "similar couplings between the trace left by the complement of the trajectory of the walks at time @xmath30 in boxes of size @xmath31 , and the trace of @xmath17 in boxes of size @xmath31 in @xmath32 can be constructed , cf .",
    "they enable one to show that for small @xmath18 there typically is a giant component containing order @xmath33 sites in the complement of the trajectory of the walk at time @xmath34 , which is unique , at least when @xmath35 , and that for large enough @xmath18 there typically are only small components .",
    "the critical value @xmath4 for the percolation of @xmath17 is moreover conjectured to be the threshold for this fragmentation problem , separating the two behaviors mentioned above .",
    "the proof of such a conjecture analogously rests on the improvement of controls on the percolative properties of @xmath17 for @xmath18 fixed but possibly close to @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath28 is replaced by a large @xmath36-regular graph on @xmath27 vertices , with @xmath29 , and random walk runs on the graph up to time @xmath37 , one can indeed show that when @xmath38 , for large @xmath27 there typically is a component in the complement of the trajectory with order @xmath27 vertices , which is unique , whereas for @xmath39 all components are small .",
    "the relevant threshold for this fragmentation problem is now the critical value @xmath4 for the percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements on the @xmath36-regular tree , ( the local model for typical points of large random @xmath36-regular graphs ) , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we now describe our results in more detail , but refer to section 1 for precise definitions .",
    "we consider graphs of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath1 is an infinite connected graph of bounded degree , endowed with bounded and uniformly positive weights along its edges .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is @xmath41-ahlfors regular for some @xmath2 , that is , see also ( [ 1.7 ] ) , @xmath42    we endow the product graph @xmath40 with weights , which take the value @xmath43 for `` vertical edges '' in the @xmath44-direction , and agree with the corresponding weights on @xmath1 for `` horizontal edges '' in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "these weights naturally determine a random walk on @xmath11 , which at each step jumps to one of its neighbors with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge leading to this neighbor .",
    "due to ( [ 0.1 ] ) the random walk on @xmath11 is in fact transient , see below([1.8 ] ) , and we assume that the green density @xmath45 has a power decay of the following kind : there is a @xmath12 in @xmath46 $ ] , such that @xmath47    with @xmath48 ( a positive number due to the constraints on @xmath49 ) , and @xmath50 the distance on @xmath11 defined by : @xmath51    where @xmath52 stands for the graph - distance on @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , with the help of @xcite , @xcite , the above assumptions can be restated in terms the following sub - gaussian estimates for the transition densities @xmath53 of the walk determined by the weighted graph @xmath1 , see remark [ rem1.1 ] 2 ) : @xmath54 { \\rm ii ) } & p^g_n(y , y ' ) + p_{n+1}^g ( y , y ' ) \\ge c\\,n^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta } } \\,\\exp\\{-c(d_g(y , y')^\\beta / n)^{\\frac{1}{\\beta - 1}}\\ } ,   \\\\[1ex ] & \\mbox{for $ n \\ge 1 \\vee d_g(y , y ' ) , \\ ; y , y'$ in $ g$}\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    and @xmath55 refers to positive constants changing from place to place .",
    "the classical example @xmath6 , @xmath7 , endowed with the natural weight equal to @xmath43 along all edges thus corresponds to @xmath56 , @xmath57 , whereas the case of @xmath1 , the discrete skeleton of the sierpinski gasket endowed with its natural weight , corresponds to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for many more examples and for equivalent characterizations of ( [ 0.4 ] ) .",
    "random interlacements on the transient weighted graph @xmath11 consist in essence of a poisson point process on the state space of doubly infinite trajectories on @xmath11 modulo time - shift , which tend to infinity at positive and negative infinite times , see @xcite , section 1 , and @xcite , remark 1.4 .",
    "a non - negative parameter @xmath18 plays the role of a multiplicative factor of the @xmath60-finite intensity measure of this poisson point process .",
    "in fact , one constructs `` at once '' , on the same probability space @xmath61 , the whole family @xmath62 , @xmath63 , of random interlacements at level @xmath18 .",
    "these random subsets of @xmath11 are infinite when @xmath18 is positive , and come as unions of the ranges of the trajectories modulo time - shift with label at most @xmath18 , in the canonical poisson cloud constructed on @xmath61 .",

    "however in the case of a general @xmath11 with @xmath102 , ( for instance when @xmath1 is the discrete skeleton of the sierpinski gasket ) , it is a challenging question left open by the present work to understand whether @xmath103 , see remark [ rem5.6 ] 2 ) .",
    "we now provide some comments on the proofs .",
    "an important difficulty stems from the long range interaction present in random interlacements , ( for instance the correlation of the events @xmath104 and @xmath105 decays as @xmath106 , when the distance between @xmath69 and @xmath107 grows , see ( [ 1.38 ] ) )",
    ". one important novelty of the present work , ( even in the classical case @xmath101 , @xmath7 ) , is that we use the same renormalization scheme to treat both the percolative and non - percolative regimes of @xmath17 .",

    "several variations of this strategy have already been employed , see   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the novelty here is that percolative and non - percolative regimes are handled in a unified and more powerful fashion thanks to the decoupling inequalities , which themselves are the consequence of the renormalization step stated in theorem [ theo2.1 ] .",
    "the strength of the decoupling inequalities comes to bear when applied to _ cascading families _ of events as discussed in section 3 .",

    "balancing out the combinatorial complexity of the possible dyadic trees arising in this construction , with the bounds coming from the decoupling inequalities ( [ 0.17 ] ) , ( [ 0.18 ] ) , is the key to the derivation of the stretched exponential bounds in ( [ 0.12 ] ) , ( [ 0.15 ] ) .",
