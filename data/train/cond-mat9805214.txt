    "collective phenomena in many materials can be traced back to the presence of interacting magnetic moments on the atomic level .",
    "the exploration of magnetic systems therefore plays a key role in both physics and materials science .",
    "the understanding of phase transitions , critical phenomena , and scaling has in part been founded on the investigation of simple model spin systems such as the ising , the xy , and the heisenberg model ( see below ) .",
    "these spin systems continue to be of high relevance for the investigation of dynamic critical behavior and dynamic scaling . on the other hand realistic models of magnetic materials",
    "can be constructed from these simple spin models , if the interaction parameters and the underlying lattice structure are taken as an input from experiments . however , in such cases the theoretical analysis of experimentally accessible quantities , such as the dynamic structure factor , is usually too demanding for analytical methods .",
    "computer simulations of the dynamical behavior of spin systems have , therefore , become a very important tool for the theoretical understanding of dynamic critical behavior and material properties of magnetic systems , as the following examples may show .",
    "large scale computer simulations have been performed in recent years in order to explore the dynamical behavior of classical xy @xcite and heisenberg models @xcite in @xmath0 dimensions and of classical heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the simulations are based on model hamiltonians for continuous degrees of freedom represented by a three - component spin @xmath2 with fixed length @xmath3 for each lattice site @xmath4 .",
    "a typical model hamiltonian is then given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the exchange integral , @xmath7 denotes a nearest - neighbor pair of spins @xmath2 , @xmath8 is an exchange anisotropy parameter , and @xmath9 determines the strength of a single - site or crystal field anisotropy . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 eq.([h ] ) represents the classical isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet or the corresponding antiferromagnet for @xmath12 or @xmath13 , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath14 eq.([h ] ) reduces to the xy model .",
    "realistic descriptions of specific magnetic materials may require additional interactions in the hamiltonian , like an additional two - spin exchange interaction between next nearest neighbors , third nearest neighbors , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "two spin interactions do not always provide a sufficient representation of the interactions in a magnetic system .",
    "a more accurate description of the isotropic ferromagnet eus for example also requires a three spin exchange interaction@xcite of the type @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a triple of nearest neighbor spins .",
    "four spin exchange coupling constants are often negligible , but the biquadratic interaction given by @xmath17 which is well known from the blume - emery - griffith ( beg ) model @xcite , needs to be considered in certain cases @xcite .    the thermodynamic properties of the model can be obtained from a monte - carlo simulation of the hamiltonian @xmath18 given by eqs.([h ] ) , ( [ h3 ] ) , and ( [ hbeg ] ) . in order to study the _ dynamic _ properties of the spin system the equations of motion given by @xcite @xmath19 must be integrated numerically , where a monte - carlo simulation of the model provides _ equilibrium _ configurations as initial conditions for eq.([eqmot ] ) .",
    "note that frequencies will be measured in energy units so that @xmath20 in eq.([eqmot ] ) .",
    "a typical quantity to be determined from the dynamics of the model is the dynamic structure factor @xmath21 , which is given by the space - time fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote the spin component , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are lattice vectors , and the average @xmath26 must be taken over a sufficiently large number of independent initial",
    "_ equilibrium _ configurations .",
    "the effect of collective thermal excitations of the system ( e.g. , phonons ) is not included in the above approach .",
    "however , in magnetic systems the typical time scale on which eq.([eqmot ] ) has to be integrated is much shorter than typical time scales set by these excitations , so that the above procedure can be justified . in general",
    "one has to resort to the solution of langevin equations rather than eq.([eqmot ] ) in order to obtain the correct dynamics , but this is beyond the scope of this article .    from the above outline of a typical monte - carlo spin dynamics study it is evident , that at least in @xmath1 the major part of the cpu time needed for a spin dynamics simulation is consumed by the numerical integration of eq.([eqmot ] ) .",
    "it is therefore desirable to do the integration with the biggest possible time step .",
    "however , using standard methods a severe restriction on the size of the time step is posed by the accuracy within which the numerical method observes the _ conservation laws _ of the dynamics .",
    "it is evident from eq.([eqmot ] ) that @xmath27 for each lattice site @xmath4 and the total energy are conserved .",
    "symmetries of the hamiltonian impose additional conservation laws . if , for example , @xmath28 according to eq.([h ] ) for @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( isotropic heisenberg model ) the magnetization @xmath29 is a conserved quantity .",
    "for the anisotropic heisenberg model , i.e. , @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 only the @xmath32-component @xmath33 of the magnetization is conserved .",
    "conservation of spin length and energy is particularly crucial , because the condition @xmath3 is a major part of the definition of the model and the energy of a configuration determines its statistical weight",
    ". it would therefore also be desirable to devise an algorithm which conserves these two quantities _",
    "the outline for the remainder of this investigation is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we describe the properties of the currently used fourth - order predictor - corrector method @xcite .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the presentation of our new integration procedure , based on trotter - suzuki decompositions of exponential operators , which conserve spin length and , for the isotropic case only , energy _",
    "exactly_. in sec.iv we compare both schemes with special regard to the accuracy within which the conservation laws hold and their speed for a given demand on accuracy . a comparison within the full framework of a spin dynamics simulation for a heisenberg ferromagnet is also presented .",
    "we finally discuss the prospects of both algorithms in view of large scale spin dynamics simulations in sec.v .",
    "predictor - corrector methods provide a very general tool for the numerical integration of initial value problems like eq.([eqmot ] ) with an equilibrium configuration as the initial value .",
    "the demand for very good spin length and energy conservation , however , requires methods with small truncation errors in the time step @xmath34 .",
    "further stability requirements for long times have led to the implementation of a fourth - order scheme , which we briefly reproduce here for the convenience of the reader .    in a more symbolic form eq.([eqmot ] ) can be written as @xmath35 with the initial condition @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a short - hand notation of a complete spin configuration written , e.g. , as a @xmath38 dimensional vector for a lattice with @xmath39 sites .",
    "the initial equilibrium configuration is simply denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "the predictor step of the scheme is then given , e.g. , by the explicit adams - bashforth four - step method @xcite @xmath41\\ ] ] which has a local truncation error of the order @xmath42 .",
    "the corrector step consists of typically one iteration of the implicit adams - moulton three - step method @xcite @xmath43\\ ] ] which also has a local truncation error of the order @xmath42 .",
    "the first application of eq.([adbash ] ) obviously requires the knowledge of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 apart from @xmath36 .",
    "these can be provided by three successive integrations of @xmath47 ( see eq.([eqmot ] ) ) by the fourth - order runge - kutta method @xcite which can not be used for the entire time integration , because truncation errors accumulate too fast during typical integration times required for high frequency resolution . in order to apply eqs.([adbash ] ) and ( [ admoul ] ) repeatedly the spin configuration at the last four time steps must be kept in memory .",
    "it is interesting to note that the predictor - corrector method according to eqs.([adbash ] ) and ( [ admoul ] ) observes the conservation laws for the magnetization according to the symmetry of the hamiltonian to within machine accuracy if periodic boundary conditions are employed .",
    "the reason is that all spins are updated simultaneously by eqs.([adbash ] ) and eq.([admoul ] ) and that the driving forces ( torques ) are evaluated precisely according to the exact equation of motion ( see eq.([eqmot ] ) ) for every time step .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions restore the discrete translational invariance of the infinite lattice in the finite sample needed for the simulation .",
    "the predictor - corrector method is very general and , therefore , its implementation is independent of the special structure of the right - hand side of the equation of motion .",
    "apart from the conservation of the magnetization the other conservation laws discussed in sec.i will therefore only be observed within the accuracy set by the truncation error of the method . in practice , this limits the time step to typically @xmath48 in @xmath1 @xcite for the isotropic model hamiltonian given by eq.([h ] ) @xmath49 , where the total integration time is of the order @xmath50 .",
    "the same method has also been used in @xmath0 with a time step @xmath51 @xcite , but in this case the total integration time did not exceed @xmath52 . in view of the fact that a time resolution of typically @xmath53 is desired for the evaluation of the time displaced correlation function given by eq.([correl ] ) , it is clear that the total cpu time required for a spin dynamics simulation in @xmath54 is dominated by the numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "a quantitative analysis is presented in sec.iv .",
    "the motion of a spin according to eq.([eqmot ] ) may be visualized as a larmor precession of the spin @xmath55 around an effective axis @xmath56 which is itself time dependent . in order to illustrate our reasoning",
    "we restrict ourselves again to the hamiltonian @xmath57 given by eq.([h ] ) for the simple case @xmath11 but for arbitrary values of @xmath8 .",
    "the evaluation of the right - hand side of eq.([eqmot ] ) then shows that the lattice can be decomposed into two sublattices such that a spin on one sublattice performs a larmor precession in a local field @xmath56 of neighbor spins which are _ all _ located on the other sublattice . for the hamiltonian given by eq.([h ] ) there are only two such sublattices if the underlying lattice is , e.g. , simple cubic or bcc .",
    "the first basic idea of the algorithm to be described below is to actually perform a _ rotation _ of a spin about its local field @xmath56 by an angle @xmath58 , rather than integrating eq.([eqmot ] ) by some standard method .",
    "this procedure guarantees the conservation of the spin length @xmath59 to within machine accuracy .",
    "( a procedure like this has already been implemented in a numerical study of spin motions in a classical ferromagnet @xcite ) .",
    "the second basic idea is to exploit the sublattice decomposition of eq.([eqmot ] ) to also ensure _ energy _ conservation to within machine accuracy .",
    "denoting the two sublattices by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , we can write eq.([eqmot ] ) in the form @xmath62 \\times { \\bf s}_{k \\in { \\cal a } } \\quad , \\quad { d \\over dt } { \\bf s}_{k \\in { \\cal b } } = \\omega_{\\cal a}[\\{{\\bf s}\\ } ] \\times { \\bf s}_{k \\in { \\cal b } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] denote the local fields produced by the spins on sublattice @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . either of the equations in eq.([eqmab ] ) reduces to a _ linear _ system of differential equations if the spins on the other sublattice are kept fixed .",
    "this suggests an _ alternating _ update scheme , i.e. , the spins @xmath65 are rotated for the given values of @xmath66 and vice versa .",
    "this implies that the scalar products @xmath67 $ ] remain constant during the update of @xmath65 and the scalar products @xmath68 $ ] remain constant during the update of @xmath69 . from eq.([h ] ) for @xmath11 and eq.([eqmot ] ) we therefore find that the energy is _ exactly _ conserved during this alternating update scheme ( see also eq.([sktdt ] ) ) .",
    "note , that each sublattice rotation is performed with the _ actual _ values of the spins on the other sublattice , so that only a _",
    "single _ copy of the spin configuration is kept in memory at any time .",
    "however , the magnetization will not be conserved during the above rotation operations . moreover ,",
    "the two alternating rotation operations do not commute , so that a closer examination of the sublattice decomposition of the spin rotation is required .    in order to obtain a simple description of the operations performed on the spin configuration during the integration of the equations of motion we again represent a full configuration by a vector @xmath37 which is decomposed into two sublattice components @xmath70 and @xmath71 according to @xmath72 .",
    "the cross products in eq.([eqmab ] ) can be expressed by matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 which are the infinitesimal generators of the rotation of the spin configuration @xmath70 on sublattice @xmath60 at fixed @xmath75 and of the spin configuration @xmath75 on sublattice @xmath61 at fixed @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the exact update of the configuration @xmath37 from time @xmath77 to @xmath78 can then be expressed by an exponential ( matrix ) operator according to @xmath79 although the exponential operator in eq.([eab ] ) rotates each spin of the configuration it has no simple explicit form , because the rotation axis for each spin depends on the configuration itself ( see eq.([eqmab ] ) ) and is therefore not known _",
    "a priori_. however , the operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 which rotate @xmath76 at fixed @xmath75 and @xmath75 at fixed @xmath70 , respectively , _ do _ have a simple explicit form .",
    "we demonstrate this for the case @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eq.([h ] ) . for each @xmath82",
    "we find @xmath83 = -j \\sum_{l = nn(k ) } { \\bf s}_l \\equiv \\omega_k , \\ ] ] where @xmath84 denotes the nearest neighbors of @xmath4 ( which belong to @xmath75 ) .",
    "eq.([omegaa ] ) can be readily generalized for @xmath30 , the case @xmath31 will be discussed below . from eqs.([eqmab ] ) and ( [ omegaa ] ) we obtain ( see also ref.@xcite ) @xmath85 \\cos ( |\\omega_k|\\delta t ) + { \\omega_k \\times { \\bf s}_k(t ) \\over |\\omega_k| } \\sin ( |\\omega_k|\\delta t).\\ ] ] note , that according to eq.([sktdt ] ) @xmath86 which explicitly confirms energy conservation . for @xmath87 eq.([sktdt ] ) also holds in exactly the same form .",
    "the alternating update scheme for the integration of eq.([eqmab ] ) , i.e. , eq.([eqmot ] ) now amounts to the replacement @xmath88 in eq.([eab ] ) , which is only correct up to terms of the order @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the magnetization will therefore only be conserved up to terms of the order @xmath34 ( global truncation error ) , which is insufficient for practical purposes .",
    "the remedy for this shortcoming , which constitutes the third basic idea of the algorithm , is now obvious .",
    "we simply employ higher order suzuki - trotter decompositions of the exponential operator in eq.([eab ] ) to increase the order of the local truncation error of the algorithm and thus improve the magnetization conservation .",
    "the simplest possible improvement is given by the well known second order decomposition @xcite @xmath90 which will be used for comparison with the predictor - corrector method outlined in sec.ii .",
    "note , that eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) is equivalent to the midpoint integration method applied to eq.([eqmab ] ) ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we furthermore use the fourth order decomposition @xcite @xmath91 with the parameters @xmath92 it is also possible to construct a decomposition like eq.([epaba ] ) with only three factors , but then @xmath93 for @xmath94 which is numerically unfavorable @xcite . from eqs.([ea2ba2 ] ) and ( [ epaba ] ) the close analogy to symplectic integrators obtained from the liouville operator formalism for molecular dynamics simulations is obvious @xcite .",
    "the sublattice decomposition of the spin degrees of freedom in spin dynamics corresponds to the natural decomposition of the degrees of freedom in hamiltonian dynamics into positions and momenta .",
    "especially the second order decomposition given by eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) is equivalent to the velocity verlet algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for recent developments in this field ) which itself is equivalent to the well - known leapfrog algorithm @xcite .    as will be shown in sec.iv , the additional computational effort to be invested in the evaluation of eq.([epaba ] ) as compared to eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) or eqs.([adbash ] ) and ( [ admoul ] ) can be compensated by using larger time steps .",
    "the evaluation of the trigonometric functions in eq.([sktdt ] ) can also be avoided by observing that the above decompositions are only correct to within a certain order in @xmath34 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to replace @xmath95 by its taylor polynomial @xmath96 , where @xmath97 if eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) is used and @xmath98 if eq.([epaba ] ) is used .",
    "the cosine in eq.([sktdt ] ) then has to be replaced by @xmath99 in order to maintain conservation of spin length .",
    "it is also worth noting that the above decompositions maintain the time inversion property of @xmath100 , i.e. , their inverse is obtained by the replacement @xmath101 . a hamiltonian with both nearest and next - nearest neighbor two - spin interactions on , e.g. , simple cubic or bcc lattices , can be treated within the above framework if the lattice is decomposed into four sublattices .",
    "in contrast to the predictor - corrector method conservation of magnetization according to the symmetry of the hamiltonian is only observed within the truncation error of the decomposition method , because according to eqs.([ea2ba2 ] ) and ( [ epaba ] ) the sublattices @xmath102 and @xmath103 are no longer strictly equivalent .",
    "we now generalize the above considerations to the case @xmath31 in eq.([h ] ) . for a spin in sublattice @xmath102",
    "the equation of motion reads @xmath104 \\times { \\bf s}_{k \\in { \\cal a } } -2d s_{k \\in { \\cal a}}^z { \\bf e}_z \\times { \\bf s}_{k \\in { \\cal a}},\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes the unit vector pointing along the @xmath32-axis , and spins in sublattice @xmath103 obey an equation of the same form .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic case ( see eq.([eqmab ] ) ) the equation of motion for each individual spin on each sublattice is _",
    "nonlinear_. it is possible to obtain an analytic solution of this equation , in the spirit of eq.([sktdt ] ) , where the trigonometric functions are basically replaced by jacobian elliptic functions , and to implement this solution as a rotation operation in one of the above decomposition schemes .",
    "this approach , however , involves very precision sensitive operations which greatly limit speed and therefore the overall efficiency of such an algorithm . in practice",
    ", it is much more convenient to include the effects of the nonlinearity in eq.([eqmdab ] ) by an iterative method , as described in the following paragraph .    for the sublattice decomposition of the spin rotation in the isotropic case discussed above",
    "the requirement for energy conservation in the presence of a single site anisotropy reads @xmath106 ^ 2   = \\omega_k \\cdot { \\bf s}_k(t ) - d \\left[s_k^z(t)\\right]^2\\ ] ] for @xmath82 and @xmath87 , where @xmath107 is given by eq.([omegaa ] ) . in order to perform a rotation operation in analogy to eq.([sktdt ] ) we have to identify an effective rotation axis .",
    "this can be achieved by rewriting eq.([energyd ] ) in the form @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 i.e. , in order to perform the rotation @xmath111 at the future time @xmath112 must be known in _",
    "advance_. this problem can only be solved iteratively starting from the initial value @xmath113 in eq.([omegad ] ) and performing several updates according to the decompositions given by eqs.([ea2ba2 ] ) or ( [ epaba ] ) , respectively , in order to improve energy conservation according to eq.([energyd ] ) .",
    "naturally , this procedure leads to a substantial slowdown of the integration algorithm , where the energy is no longer exactly conserved .",
    "details are discussed in sec.iv . the biquadratic interaction given by eq.([hbeg ] ) can be treated by the same iterative scheme . the three - spin interaction given by eq.([h3 ] ) , however , requires a reconsideration of the sublattice decomposition .",
    "specific numerical examples in comparison with those obtained from the predictor - corrector method are presented in the following section .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of the integration methods outlined above we restrict ourselves to the hamiltonian @xmath28 given by eq.([h ] ) for @xmath10 in @xmath1 .",
    "the underlying lattice is simple cubic with @xmath114 lattice sites in each direction and periodic boundary conditions are imposed in all cases discussed below .",
    "the simulations have been performed on ibm rs/6000 workstations at the center for simulational physics and a cray c90 at the pittsburgh supercomputer center .    in order to compare the different integration methods we first investigate the accuracy within which the conservation laws are fulfilled . as a standard initial configuration",
    "we choose a well equilibrated configuration from a monte - carlo simulation of the model defined by eq.([h ] ) for @xmath10 at a temperature @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 refers to the critical temperature of the isotropic model @xmath49 and is given by @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of such a configuration differs from zero and provides an indicator for the numerical quality of the magnetization conservation .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion to @xmath120 and monitor the energy @xmath121 of the configuration per spin and in units of the exchange coupling constant @xmath6 and the modulus latexmath:[$m(t ) \\equiv    case @xmath11 and its @xmath32-component @xmath123 for the stongly anisotropic case @xmath124 as functions of time .",
    "note , that for these tests both integration methods are started from identical initial configurations .",
    "the time step for the predictor - corrector method is chosen as @xmath48 in all cases .",

    "fig.[mz2 ] displays the magnetization conservation for the predictor - corrector method @xmath127 and the second order decomposition method according to eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) for @xmath128 .",
    "the predictor - corrector method conserves @xmath129 _ exactly _ , whereas the second order decomposition causes fluctuations of @xmath129 on all time scales .",
    "the apparent deviation of the temporal average of the magnetization from the exact value is due to the finite sample time ; for times greater than @xmath130 the deviation changes sign and fluctuations on time scales larger than @xmath131 become visible . the temporal structure of @xmath129 for the decomposition methods given by eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) for @xmath128 and eq.([epaba ] ) for @xmath132",
    "is displayed in fig.[mz4 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the fourth order decomposition gives a substantially better magnetization conservation than the second order decomposition despite the very large time step . in order to achieve the same overall accuracy of the magnetization conservation with the second order decomposition",
    "a time step @xmath133 is neccessary . a single integration of the equations of motion using eq.([ea2ba2 ] )",
    "( second order decomposition ) is about twice as fast as the predictor - corrector method used here .",
    "the more complex fourth order decomposition ( see eq.([epaba ] ) ) , however , is about @xmath134 times slower than the predictor corrector method . taking the increase in time step by factors of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , into account , we find that both decomposition methods yield an eightfold speedup of the integration of the equation of motion . if the overall quality of the magnetization conservation is also taken into account , there is a clear advantage for the fourth order decomposition according to eq.([epaba ] ) for the isotropic case @xmath11 .",
    "we now turn to the strongly anisotropic case @xmath124 .",
    "the predictor - corrector method can be applied as before , but the decomposition scheme needs a major modification because the spin rotation axis depends on the spin value @xmath111 at the future time @xmath137 ( see eq.([omegad ] ) ) .",
    "as already pointed out in sec.iii this gives rise to a self consistency problem which can be solved iteratively , where the quality of the energy conservation depends on the number of iterations performed .",
    "for the second order decomposition ( see eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) ) and the time step @xmath138 two iterations are sufficient to obtain a better energy conservation than the predictor - corrector method .",
    "this means that a single integration of the equations of motion using the second order decomposition takes twice as long as for @xmath11 , so that its advantage in speed only comes from the increase in the time step , which is still a factor of four . for the fourth order decomposition according to eq.([epaba ] ) with @xmath132 six iterations are needed to obtain energy conservation to within six significant digits , which makes one integration with the fourth order decomposition 15 times slower than one integration with the predictor - corrector method . from the increase of @xmath34 by a factor 20 only a 30% gain in speed remains for eq.([epaba ] ) .",
    "the number of iterations needed decreases with @xmath34 , but this decrease does not compensate the loss in speed due to the smaller time step . however , one still obtains a greatly improved energy conservation .",
    "the direct comparison of the energy conservation is shown in fig.[e2d ] .",
    "all three methods behave in a similar way , the change in energy is basically linear with time .",
    "the reason for this is the iterative nature of all three methods in the case @xmath31 .",
    "the magnetization fluctuations shown in fig.[mz2d ] for the predictor - corrector and the second order decomposition method @xmath139 reveal the same behavior of both methods as shown in fig.[mz2 ] for @xmath11 . the direct comparison between the second and fourth order decomposition for @xmath128 and @xmath140 , respectively , is displayed in fig.[mz4d ] .",
    "the overall accuracy of the magnetization conservation appears to be independent of @xmath9 for both decomposition methods .",
    "if the emphasis is put on overall energy conservation _ and _ speed , the second order decomposition given by eq.([ea2ba2 ] ) has some advantages over the predictor - corrector method . if the emphasis is put on energy conservation alone , the fourth order decomposition given by eq.([epaba ] ) shows the best performance , but it is only slightly faster than the predictor - corrector method .",
    "we close this section with a direct comparison of the longitudinal ( @xmath141 ) and transverse ( @xmath142 ) components of the dynamic structure factor for the isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet ( see eq.([h ] ) for @xmath11 ) on a simple cubic lattice ( @xmath114 , periodic boundary conditions ) at the temperature @xmath115 in the @xmath143 direction . in order to measure @xmath141 one",

    "the frequency resolution is @xmath151 .",
    "the shoulder like feature at @xmath152 in @xmath153 ( see fig.[sql ] ) is due to many - spin wave processes , the description of which is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "both methods have spent about the same cpu time on generating the initial configurations , but with the time steps given above , the integration of the equations of motion with the second order decomposition method is about eight times faster than with the predictor - corrector method .",
    "the discrepancy between the errorbars shown in fig.[sqt ] is of statistical origin and indicates the statistical uncertainty of the errorbars themselves .",
    "note , however , that the discrepancy only occurs in a frequency region well outside the spin wave peak , where the signal level is almost three orders of magnitude below its peak value .",
    "starting from a well developed and established predictor - corrector method for the numerical integration of the equations of motion of a classical spin system as a timing and precision standard we devised and tested an alternative class of algorithms which is based on suzuki - trotter decompositions of exponential operators .",

    "the greatest advantage of the predictor - corrector method is its versatility and its capability to conserve the magnetization exactly .",
    "isotropic and anisotropic spins systems with nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions can be treated within one and the same numerical approach .",
    "the decomposition of the lattice into sublattices , which is the basis for the decomposition method , depends on the range of the interactions , so that this numerical approach is far less general than the predictor - corrector method .",
    "crystal field anisotropies leave the performance of the predictor - corrector method almost unaffected , whereas the decomposition method suffers from a drastic reduction in speed .",
    "the greatest advantage of the decomposition method is its capability for handling large time steps and the exact conservation of spin length . in the absence of anisotropies",
    "it also conserves the energy exactly and it maintains reversibility . for anisotropic hamiltonians energy conservation and reversibility can be obtained to a high accuracy using iterative schemes ; exact magnetization conservation , however , is lost .",
    "the time steps typically used are unaccessible by the predictor - corrector method due to the lack of exact energy conservation within the algorithm .",
    "the resulting speedup of a spin dynamics simulation gives access to larger lattices , provided a second order decomposition is sufficiently accurate for the problem under investigation . in simple cases the fourth order decomposition yields very accurate results even for time steps an order of magnitude larger than typical time steps used for the predictor - corrector method .",
    "a general recommendation for one or the other method can not be given .",
    "if , however , special interactions are the main objective of the investigation , one should resort to the predictor - corrector method because of its generality .",
    "if the interactions in the system are standard two - spin exchange interactions and the objective is to study large systems , one should consider the decomposition method because of its speed and its built - in energy and spin length conservation .",
