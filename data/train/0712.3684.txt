    "the best known examples of topological magnetic solitons are magnetic bubbles or skyrmions observed in abundance in ferromagnetic films with easy - axis anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is less clear in the case of ferromagnets with easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the relevant topological structures are theoretically predicted to be half skyrmions or vortices , with a logarithmically divergent energy that may inhibit production of an isolated vortex on an infinite film .",
    "thus the early studies of magnetic vortex dynamics had been mostly theoretical @xcite drawing on various analogies with related work on ferromagnetic bubbles @xcite , with vortex dynamics in classical fluids and superfluids @xcite , as well as with the dynamics of interacting electric charges in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically in recent years .",
    "it has been realized that a disc - shaped magnetic element , with a diameter of a few hundred of nanometers , provides an excellent geometry for the realization of a magnetic vortex configuration . in particular , the exchange energy is finite on a finite element while the magnetostatic field vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core . as a result ,",
    "the vortex is actually the lowest energy magnetic state in a disc - shaped element . in other words ,",
    "interest in the vortex stems from the fact that it is a nontrivial magnetic state which can , nevertheless , be spontaneously created in magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether nontrivial magnetic states other than the single vortex may play an important role in the dynamics of magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "an answer to this question comes from a somewhat unlikely direction .",
    "recent experiments have shown a peculiar dynamical behavior of vortices and magnetic domain walls when these are probed by external magnetic fields .",
    "vortices may switch their polarity under the influence of a very weak external magnetic field of the order of a few mt @xcite . the same switching phenomenon was observed by passing an a.c .",
    "electrical current through a magnetic disc @xcite .",
    "since the polarity of the vortex contributes to its topological structure , the switching process clearly implies a discontinuous ( topologically forbidden ) change of the magnetic configuration .",
    "this is certainly a surprise especially because the external field is rather weak .",
    "the key to this phenomenon is the appearance of vortex pairs which are spontaneously created in the vicinity of existing vortices @xcite .",
    "the creation of topological excitations ( vortex pairs ) by alternating external fields had been anticipated by an early study based on collective coordinates @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study vortex - antivortex pairs ( va pairs ) which are nontrivial magnetic states that play an important role in the dynamics of magnetic elements .",
    "however , unlike a single vortex , a va pair is a localized object whose energy remains finite even on an infinite film .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that the essential features of the dynamics of va pairs can be understood in the infinite - film approximation which is adopted in the following .",
    "a brief summary of the relevant dynamical equations and related topological structures is given in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : kelvin ] we study a va pair in which the vortex and the antivortex carry the same polarity .",
    "such a pair is shown to undergo translational kelvin motion analogous to that observed in fluid dynamics @xcite . in section  [ sec : rotate ] we study a va pair in which the vortex and the antivortex carry opposite polarities . such a pair is shown to behave as a rotating vortex dipole @xcite because its topological structure is substantially different than that of the pair in kelvin motion .",
    "the preceding results are combined in section  [ sec : switching ] to demonstrate that a rotating vortex dipole may be annihilated by a quasi - continuous process in spite of its nontrivial topological structure . in particular",
    ", no energy barrier has to be overcome in contrast to the usual expectations for topological solitons .",
    "this opens the possibility for switching mechanisms between topologically distinct states in ferromagnets .",
    "the possibility to change the topological structure leads to a dramatic change in the magnetization dynamics as a va pair is created or annihilated .",
    "such a pair annihilation process lies in the heart of the counter - intuitive vortex polarity switching event that was observed in magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "some concluding remarks are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "finally , an appendix is devoted to a brief description of the dynamics of interacting electric charges in a uniform magnetic field , which also exhibits most of the peculiar features of the dynamics of va pairs .",
    "a ferromagnet is characterized by the magnetization @xmath6 measured in units of the constant saturation magnetization @xmath7 .",
    "hence @xmath8 is a vector field of unit length , @xmath9 , but is otherwise a nontrivial function of position and time @xmath10 that satisfies the rationalized landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation @xmath11 here distances are measured in units of the exchange length @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the exchange constant , and the unit of time is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",

    "an important omission in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lle ] ) is the demagnetizing field produced by the magnetization itself @xcite .",

    "equations ( [ eq : lle]),([eq : llethetaphi ] ) , and ( [ eq : lleomega ] ) are three equivalent versions of the ll equation and may be used at convenience depending on the specific calculation considered .",
    "a key quantity for describing both topological and dynamical properties of the 2d ll equation is the local topological vorticity @xmath41 defined from @xcite : @xmath42 where the usual summation convention is invoked for the repeated indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which take over two distinct values corresponding to the two spatial coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the 2d antisymmetric tensor . in particular , one may consider the total topological vorticity @xmath48 and the pontryagin index or skyrmion number @xmath49 defined from @xmath50 a naive partial integration using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vorticity1 ] ) yields @xmath51 for all magnetic configurations for which such an integration is permissible .",

    "half integer values are also possible in the case of field configurations with more complicated structure at infinity such as half skyrmions or vortices ( see below ) .",
    "the local topological vorticity @xmath15 is also important for an unambiguous definition of conservation laws in the ll equation .",
    "hence the linear momentum ( impulse ) @xmath53 is defined from @xmath54 while the angular momentum ( impulse ) is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 . since detailed discussions of these conservation laws",
    "have already appeared in the literature @xcite we simply note here that analogous conservation laws were defined as moments of ordinary vorticity in fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "we first search for static ( time independent ) solutions of the ll equation which may be obtained by omitting time derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ eq : llethetaphi ] ) and further introducing the axially symmetric ansatz @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath61 , @xmath62 will be referred to as the vortex number , and @xmath63 is an arbitrary constant phase reflecting the azimuthal invariance .",
    "the resulting ordinary differential equation for the amplitude @xmath64 is solved numerically with standard boundary condition @xmath65 and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] .",

    "( [ eq : skyrmionnumber ] ) to be @xmath70 where the vortex number @xmath62 and the polarity @xmath67 may be taken in any combination .",
    "thus , we must consider four possibilities ; namely , a vortex that comes in two varieties ( @xmath71 ) and thus @xmath72 , and an antivortex which also comes in two varieties ( @xmath73 ) and thus @xmath74 .",
    "in all cases the calculated static solution is a topological soliton with half integer skyrmion number , in contrast to ordinary skyrmions ( such as magnetic bubbles ) which carry integer @xmath49 .",
    "our main aim in the continuation of this paper is to search for nontrivial solutions that may combine a vortex and an antivortex ( va pair ) in a way that the total energy is finite .",
    "we leave aside for the moment the ll equation and construct model va pairs in terms of the basic single - vortex configuration described above .",
    "this is easily accomplished by invoking the stereographic variable @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) to write a single ( @xmath75 ) vortex located at the origin of coordinates as @xmath76 where @xmath64 is the vortex profile taken from fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] or simply the model profile defined from @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we now produce two replicas of the basic vortex to describe a pair of vortices by the product ansatz @xmath79 where @xmath80 is configuration ( [ eq : omega - thetaphi ] ) applied for @xmath81 and the origin displaced to , say , @xmath82 while @xmath83 is a @xmath84 vortex located around @xmath85 .",
    "the skyrmion number of this configuration is given by @xmath86 and its energy is finite only if we restrict attention to vortex - antivortex ( va ) pairs @xmath87 . for definiteness",
    "we choose @xmath88 and @xmath89 and thus the skyrmion number @xmath90 depends on the polarities @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "now a va pair with equal polarities @xmath93 is topologically trivial @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , a va pair with opposite polarities is topologically equivalent to a skyrmion ( @xmath95 , for @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) or an antiskyrmion ( @xmath98 , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) . in all three cases configuration ( [ eq :",
    "productomega ] ) carries finite energy because its overall phase cancels out at spatial infinity where the magnetization approaches the uniform configuration @xmath101 modulo an overall azimuthal rotation which depends on the choice of individual phases @xmath63 in the ansatz ( [ eq : productomega ] ) .",
    "this explains , in particular , why va pairs are characterized by an integer skyrmion number ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "needless to say , the va pairs constructed above are not solutions of the ll equation .",
    "yet an interesting picture arises when configuration ( [ eq : productomega ] ) is used as an initial condition in the complete equation ( [ eq : lleomega ] ) .",
    "a topologically trivial ( @xmath103 ) va pair undergoes kelvin motion in which the vortex and the antivortex initially located at a relative distance @xmath104 along the x axis move in parallel along the y axis with nearly constant velocity .",
    "in contrast , a topologically nontrivial ( @xmath105 ) va pair undergoes rotational motion around a fixed guiding center at nearly constant angular velocity . in both cases the main trajectories",
    "are decorated by larmor - type oscillations @xcite which are tamed when the relative distance between the vortex and the antivortex is large .",
    "the effect of the polarity of vortex pairs has been studied experimentally in patterned ferromagnetic ellipses @xcite .",
    "two vortices were created an ellipse and it was found that their dynamics depended on their relative polarity , as is indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : subtracts ] ) .    in the following two sections we examine the two cases in turn .",
    "in particular , we aim at constructing true steady - state solitary waves that describe va pairs in pure kelvin motion for @xmath103 and pure rotational motion for @xmath105 .",
    "as the title of this section suggests , va pairs in kelvin motion were originally studied in the context of ordinary fluid dynamics @xcite . a further analogy exists with the 2d motion of an electron - positron pair interacting via the coulomb potential and placed in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "if the electron and the positron are initially at rest their guiding centers will move along two parallel straight lines while the actual trajectories will display the familiar larmor oscillations .",
    "however , when the electron and the positron are given a common initial velocity such that the coulomb force is exactly balanced by the magnetic force , both the guiding centers and the actual positions of the charges will move steadily along parallel lines , even though the two sets of trajectories do not coincide .",
    "the resulting special configuration may be thought of as a peculiar electron - positron bound state in steady translational motion ( see our appendix ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that a solitary wave exists in a 2d easy - plane ferromagnet which describes a va pair that proceeds rigidly ( without larmor oscillations ) in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex and the antivortex , probably because the mutual force is exactly balanced by a topological `` magnus force '' .",
    "the actual existence of such a solitary wave was established in ref .",
    "@xcite whose main result is briefly reviewed in the remainder of this section .    as it turns out , when the relative distance is large , the sought after solitary wave resembles in its gross features the model va pair of eq .",
    "( [ eq : productomega ] ) applied for , say , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( thus @xmath103 ) .",
    "we may then invoke this model to motivate some important asymptotic results valid for large @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , the local topological vorticity @xmath15 is then peaked around the two points @xmath108 and @xmath109 with weights @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively , corresponding to the total vorticities @xmath48 of the individual vortex and antivortex .",
    "then the impulse defined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : linmomentum ] ) yields @xmath112 , thanks to reflexion symmetry , while @xmath113 . one may also invoke the derrick - like scaling relation applied to the extended energy functional @xmath114 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the total anisotropy energy of the va pair . for large @xmath104",
    "this energy approaches the sum of the anisotropy energies of the individual vortex and antivortex , each given by @xmath117 in view of the virial relation ( [ eq : virial1 ] ) .",

    "the va pair disappears ( i.e. , the skyrmion number changes abruptly from @xmath105 to @xmath103 ) and a burst of energy equal to @xmath189 is released into the system , probably in the form of spin waves . in physical units , the amount of energy released is given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the film thickness and @xmath13 the exchange constant . for typical values @xmath196 nm and @xmath197 j /",
    "m we obtain the estimate @xmath198 j which is apparently in rough agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the scenario described above explains how a topologically forbidden @xmath199 transition can take place in a real ferromagnet but does not by itself account for the experimentally observed vortex core switching .",
    "the complete scenario involves two distinct steps .",
    "first , application of a short burst of an alternating magnetic field creates a va pair in the vicinity of a preexisting single vortex .",
    "second , a three - body collision takes place during which a suitable pair of vortices is annihilated through a @xmath4 transition of the type described above , and the final product is a single vortex with polarity opposite to that of the original vortex @xcite .",
    "we also note that a system with three vortices ( two vortices and an antivortex which form a cross - tie wall ) was observed in a rectangular platelet in @xcite .",
    "their spectrum of eigenmodes was studied experimantally .",
    "here we do not address the question of how a va pair is actually created .",
    "rather we concentrate on step 2 of the process and explain in some detail how vortex core switching may occur in a three - body collision .",
    "specifically , let us assume that a single @xmath200=c vortex is initially at rest at some specified point which is taken to be the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "let us further assume that a topologically trivial @xmath1 va pair consisting of a @xmath201=a vortex and a @xmath202=b antivortex is somehow created in the neighborhood of the original vortex . once created the ab pair will undergo kelvin motion of the type described in section [ sec : kelvin ] and eventually collide with the single vortex c.    the process was simulated by a numerical solution of the corresponding initial - value problem in the ll equation .",
    "figure [ fig : switch_v01 ] provides an illustration with three characteristic snapshots in the case of a relatively slow kelvin pair initially moving along the y axis with velocity @xmath203 for which the vortex and the antivortex are separated by a distance @xmath204 . as the pair approaches , the original c=@xmath200 vortex teams up with the b=@xmath202 partner of the ab pair to form a new , topologically nontrivial @xmath205 va pair in quasi - rotational motion .",
    "in fact , b rotates almost a full circle around c before rejoining its original partner a. the new ab pair is again a topologically trivial @xmath1 va pair in kelvin motion that moves away from the target vortex , having suffered a total scattering angle that is greater than @xmath117 from its original direction .",
    "the scattering is inelastic in the sense that the outgoing ab pair moves out with greater velocity @xmath206 . and",
    ", most remarkably , the target vortex c moves away from the origin and comes to rest at a new location in the fourth quadrant of the xy plane .",
    "this rather unusual behavior is explained by the unusual nature of the conservation laws ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) which allow for a transmutation between position and impulse in the case of topologically nontrivial systems , such as the three - vortex system considered here ( a more detailed discussion will be given in a future publication ) .",
    "the preceding numerical experiment was repeated for a kelvin pair with relatively large velocity @xmath207 for which the vortex and the antivortex are tightly bound at a relative distance @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "the process is again illustrated by three characteristic snapshots in figure [ fig : switch_v05 ] .",
    "while the initial stages of the process are similar to those encountered in the case of slow kelvin motion ( figure [ fig : switch_v01 ] ) a substantial departure occurs when the pair now approaches the target vortex . in particular , as soon as antivortex b=@xmath202 begins to rotate around the target vortex c=@xmath200 they collide and undergo a spectacular @xmath209 transition ( annihilation ) leaving behind the a=@xmath201 vortex which may be thought of as the target vortex c=@xmath200 with polarity flipped from @xmath210 to 1 ( vortex core switching ) and a burst of spin waves propagating away from the scattering region .    a detailed numerical investigation of the three - vortex process for kelvin waves with velocities in the allowed range @xmath211 suggests the existence of the three characteristic regions separated by two critical velocities @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( such that @xmath214 , with @xmath215 being the critical velocity discussed in section [ sec : kelvin ] ) . for @xmath216 , the kelvin pair undergoes nearly elastic scattering of the type depicted in figure [ fig : switch_v01 ] .",
    "for @xmath217 , the process leads to a topologically forbidden @xmath209 transition of the type illustrated in figure [ fig : switch_v05 ] .",
    "there is also some evidence that fast kelvin waves with velocities in the narrow range @xmath218 undergo a nearly elastic scattering without inversion of the polarity of the target vortex .",
    "the va pairs analyzed in this paper are special examples of solitary waves whose dynamics is closely related to their topological structure .",
    "for example , the va pairs studied in section  [ sec : kelvin ] can undergo free translational motion because their topological charge vanishes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in contrast , a va pair with nonvanishing @xmath49 performs rotational motion around a fixed guiding center and is thus spontaneously pinned within the ferromagnetic medium , as discussed in section  [ sec : rotate ] .",
    "such a peculiar dynamical behavior would have been surprising had it not occurred previously in the case of interacting electric charges in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is then interesting to ascertain conditions under which a certain field theory would exhibit a similar link between topology and dynamics .",
    "a simple criterion was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is briefly summarized as follows .",
    "we restrict attention to 2d hamiltonian systems described in terms of @xmath219 pairs of canonically conjugate variables @xmath220 with @xmath221 .",
    "then one may define the local vorticity @xmath222 which is a simple generalization of the first step of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vorticity1 ] ) , the remaining two steps being special to the specific example considered in the present paper ( ferromagnets ) . now , in general ,",
    "the total vorticity @xmath223 is expected to vanish by a trivial partial integration using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vorticity2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a nonzero @xmath48 would signal a special topological structure of the field theory under consideration and may lead to peculiar dynamics .",
    "the theory analyzed in the present paper is an example ( with @xmath224 ) which yields a nonzero @xmath48 that may be identified with the pontryagin index @xmath225 .",
    "an example with @xmath226 is provided by a 2d antiferromagnet where @xmath227 except when an external field is present which may lead to @xmath228 and an interesting link between topology and dynamics @xcite .",
    "implicit in the preceding general argument is the fact that a topological charge @xmath49 is conserved . also taking into account that @xmath49 is quantized",
    ", one would expect that a topological ( @xmath229 ) soliton can not be annihilated in a continuous manner .",
    "nevertheless , a quasi - continuous process was described in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper according to which a rotating va pair with @xmath95 may be reduced to a singular point and thereby be eliminated by lattice discreteness without encountering an energy barrier .",
    "a mechanism for changing the topological number of a magnetic configuration makes it possible to obtain controlled switching between topologically distinct ( and thus robust ) magnetic states .",
    "this was achieved in the experiments of refs .",
    "the dynamics underlying both experiments involves a three - vortex process @xcite initiated by the production of a topologically trivial va pair in the vicinity of a preexisting vortex by an alternating magnetic field .",
    "it has been predicted that the same phenomenon would occur if one uses a rotating external field @xcite .",
    "the resulting three - vortex system carries nonzero topological charge and is thus by itself a rotating object spontaneously pinned in the magnet . also due to dissipation",
    ", a quasi - continuous process takes place that changes the topological number by one unit , leaving behind a burst of energy in the form of spin waves and a single vortex with polarity opposite to that of the original vortex .",
    "although our strictly 2d treatment provides a detailed scenario for the three - vortex process that leads to polarity switching , it does not account for the initial production of a topologically trivial va pair .",
    "this is partly due to our approximation of a thin film with infinite extent .",
    "implicit in this approximation is the assumption that the demagnetizing field amounts to a simple ( additive ) renormalization of easy - plane anisotropy . while this assumption appears to be firmly established for static magnetic states @xcite we do not know of a corresponding mathematical derivation for dynamical processes of the type discussed here .",
    "it is also important to visualize how the formation of a singular point discussed in the present strictly 2d context appears within a realistic magnetic element of finite extent .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that , in an element of finite thickness , a singular point is first created at one of the surfaces of the element .",
    "the va pair then vanishes by formation and subsequent annihilation of a singular point at successive levels away from the surface . at the stage",
    "when a singular point has been formed and annihilated , say , near the top surface , while the va pair is still present in the bulk of the element , a bloch point ( bp ) is created in the element . this is a somewhat simplified realization of the bp studied in ref .",
    "needless to say , the bp created near the top surface is eventually annihilated when the va pair exits the system through the lower surface .",
    "it is important to emphasize the unusual fact that during creation and annihilation of the bp the system does not have to overcome an energy barrier , unlike the case discussed in @xcite , essentially for the same reasons explained for the strictly 2d va pairs studied in the main text .",
    "is grateful for hospitality at the max - planck institute for the physics of complex systems ( dresden ) where this work was completed .",
    "most of the distinct features of the dynamics of va pairs occur also in the dynamics of electric charges in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xmath230 .",
    "although we shall mainly be interested in 2d motion in a plane perpendicular to @xmath230 , it is convenient to keep for the moment 3d notation and write the equations of motion for two interacting charges @xmath231 and @xmath232 : @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the mutual force derived from a potential energy @xmath235 and @xmath236 denotes derivative with respect to the argument @xmath237 .",
    "the conserved energy functional is then given by @xmath238 which does not depend explicitly on the magnetic field , while the conserved linear momentum ( impulse ) is now given by @xmath239 and differs from the usual mechanical definition by an important field dependent term .",
    "this ( second ) term actually indicates a rather profound influence of the magnetic field on the dynamics of electric charges .",
    "for instance , note that a shift of the origin of coordinates by a constant vector @xmath240 , thus @xmath241 and @xmath242 , induces a nontrivial change on the impulse @xmath243 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) given by @xmath244 this unusual behavior is analogous to that of the impulse defined by eq .",
