    "the authors strongly believe in the existence of a @xmath0-adic extension of the local langlands correspondence and even the functoriality principle .",
    "unfortunately , at the present time , there is not even a precise picture yet which two sets this extension will put into correspondence . on the galois side we should at least have all @xmath0-adic weil group representations . on the reductive group side the evidence points into the direction of a set related to the set of isomorphism classes of all topologically irreducible admissible banach space representations .",
    "but it seems very difficult to construct such banach space representations .",
    "there has been progress recently by breuil / berger and by colmez only for the group @xmath1 .",
    "if we restrict attention on the galois side to @xmath2-dimensional de rham representations of the galois group @xmath3 of some finite extension @xmath4 of @xmath5 then the first author some time ago has put forward the following philosophy . by the theory of colmez and fontaine , a de rham representation",
    "gives rise ( roughly ) to a vector space @xmath6 which carries a filtration as well as an action of the weil - deligne group of @xmath4 , the two being in a numerical relation called admissibility .",
    "the classical local langlands correspondence associates with the semisimplification of the weil - deligne group action an irreducible smooth representation of @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    ", the type of the filtration can be viewed as a highest weight giving rise to an irreducible rational representation of @xmath7 .",
    "the tensor product of the two forms a locally algebraic representation @xmath8 .",
    "note that the construction of @xmath8 does not make use of the admissibility relation on @xmath6 .",
    "rather the admissibility of the filtration on @xmath6 should be reflected by the existence of a @xmath7-invariant norm on @xmath8 .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to turn this philosophy into a precise conjecture which is done in section 4 .",
    "the problem , of course , is that the de rham representation can be such that the smooth part of @xmath8 is trivial whereas the algebraic part is not",
    ". then @xmath8 can not carry an invariant norm . in order to overcome this difficulty we suggest to use a modified version of the classical local langlands correspondence . by the langlands classification ,",
    "every irreducible smooth representation is the unique irreducible quotient of a particular parabolically induced representation .",
    "we propose to use ( a twist of ) the latter instead of its irreducible quotient . in this way",
    "the smooth part of @xmath8 always is infinite dimensional and , in fact , reducible in general . in section 5",
    ", we establish some special cases of our conjecture as well as some partial results in its direction .",
    "if we restrict attention further to crystalline galois representations then the smooth part of @xmath8 is unramified .",
    "the classical local langlands correspondence for unramified representations is encapsulated in the satake isomorphism which computes the spectrum of the satake - hecke algebra of @xmath9 .",
    "the satake - hecke algebra together with its universal module has a natural norm completion leading to a banach - hecke algebra acting on a universal banach module .",
    "this was shown by the second author together with teitelbaum in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in that paper that this banach - hecke algebra naturally is the algebra of analytic functions on an explicitly given affinoid domain . moreover , the defining conditions for this affinoid domain turn out to be equivalent to the admissibility condition for filtrations .",
    "this means that any crystalline galois representation satisfying a certain regularity condition on its hodge - tate weights gives rise to a point in such an affinoid domain and hence to a specialization in that point of the corresponding universal banach module .",
    "our earlier conjecture means in this picture that this banach space representation of @xmath7 obtained by specialization is non - zero .",
    "unfortunately , in @xcite an embedding of @xmath4 into the coefficient field @xmath10 of our representations was distinguished .",
    "this had the consequence that all of the above could only be shown for a subclass of the crystalline galois representations called special ones .",
    "even worse , the corresponding normalizations in @xcite are , as we believe now , misleading . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we take up this theory again in a completely general way . by working systematically with @xmath5-rational representations of @xmath7 ,",
    "we do obtain the above results for arbitrary `` regular '' crystalline galois representations .",
    "at this point it should be stressed that , in this paper , we do not set up an actual conjectural correspondence between galois and banach space representations . in both pictures ,",
    "our conjecture is of the form that on a certain object there exists an admissible filtration if and only if a certain banach space representation associated to this object ( either by completion or by specialization ) is non - zero .",
    "but with the exception of @xmath1 , there always will be infinitely many possibilities for the admissible filtration ( provided there exists at least one ) .",
    "hence , in some sense , any of these conjecturally non - zero banach space representations is responsible for a specific whole family of galois representations .",
    "our picture in the crystalline case is , upon the prize of having and fixing a square root of @xmath0 in the coefficient field @xmath10 , very well adapted to functoriality .",
    "the theory of banach - hecke algebras as described above works perfectly well for arbitrary split connected reductive groups @xmath11 over @xmath4 ( and is developed in this generality in section 2 ) , and can in a certain sense be made functorial on the category of @xmath10-rational representations of the connected langlands dual group @xmath12 of @xmath11 over @xmath10 .",
    "this makes it possible , by using the formalism of tannakian categories , to associate with any specialization of a universal banach module for @xmath11 ( which still conjecturally is non - zero ) a family of isomorphism classes of crystalline galois representations with values in the dual group @xmath13 over the algebraic closure @xmath14 of @xmath10 . under the already mentioned restrictions , this",
    "was done in @xcite and is here established in general in section 6 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite and also in section 6 , we have to assume that the split group @xmath11 is such that the half sum @xmath15 of its positive roots is still an integral character .",
    "the appearance of this @xmath15 is forced upon us by functoriality . to deal with @xmath15 in general , we need a counterpart on the galois side which is a square root of the cyclotomic character .",
    "this does not exist in general on the galois group , which leads to the following interesting construction .",
    "the group @xmath16 has , up to isomorphism , a unique non - trivial central extension @xmath17 with kernel of order two .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the restriction of @xmath17 to @xmath4 .",
    "on @xmath19 we always have a square root of the cyclotomic character provided the coefficient field @xmath10 is large enough . as a consequence of the theory of colmez and fontaine , one can set up a theory of crystalline representations of the group @xmath19 .",
    "it is exactly families of such which we get in the case of split groups for which @xmath15 is not integral .",
    "this is the content of section 7 .",
    "we are grateful to j .-",
    "fontaine for helpful discussions about the material in this section .    throughout the paper we fix two finite extensions @xmath4 ( the base field ) and @xmath10 ( the coefficient field ) of @xmath20 such that @xmath21=\\vert{\\rm hom}_{\\qp}(l , k)\\vert$ ] where @xmath22 denotes the set of all @xmath5-linear embeddings of the field @xmath4 into the field @xmath10 .",
