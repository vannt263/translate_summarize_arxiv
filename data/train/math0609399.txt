    "let @xmath342 be a smooth closed path on @xmath18 ; here @xmath343 is a standard circle .",
    "note that at any point of the surfaces @xmath18 we know where is the `` direction to the north '' .",
    "hence , at any point @xmath344 we can apply a compass and measure the direction of the tangent vector @xmath345 . moving along our path @xmath346",
    "we make the tangent vector turn in the compass .",
    "thus we get a map @xmath347 from the parameter circle to the circumference of the compass .",
    "this map is called the _ gauss map_.",
    "we define the _ index _ @xmath348 of the path @xmath349 as a degree of the corresponding gauss map ( or , in other words as the algebraic number of turns of the tangent vector around the compass ) taken modulo @xmath350 .",
    "@xmath351    it is easy to see that @xmath348 does not depend on parameterization .",
    "moreover , it does not change under small deformations of the path . deforming the path more drastically",
    "we may change its position with respect to conical singularities of the flat metric .",
    "say , the initial path might go on the left of @xmath352 and its deformation might pass on the right of @xmath352 .",
    "this deformation changes the @xmath353 .",
    "however , if the cone angle at @xmath352 is of the type @xmath354 , then @xmath355 does not change ! this observation explains why @xmath348 is well - defined for a free homotopy class @xmath356 $ ] when @xmath357 ( and hence , when all cone angles are odd multiples of @xmath8 ) .",
    "the lemma above shows that the parity of the spin structure is an invariant of connected components of the strata of those abelian differentials ( equivalently , flat surfaces ) , which have zeroes of even degrees ( equivalently , conical points with cone angles which are odd multiples of @xmath8 ) .      a flat surface",
    "@xmath18 may have a symmetry ; one specific family of such flat surfaces , which are `` more symmetric than others '' is of a special interest for us .",
    "recall that there is a one - to - one correspondence between flat surfaces and pairs ( riemann surface @xmath363 , holomorphic 1-form @xmath22 ) .",
    "when the corresponding riemann surface is hyperelliptic the hyperelliptic involution @xmath364 acts on any holomorphic 1-form @xmath22 as @xmath365 .",
    "we say that a flat surface @xmath18 is a hyperelliptic flat surface if there is an isometry @xmath366 such that @xmath367 is an involution , @xmath368 , and the quotient surface @xmath369 is a topological sphere . in flat",
    "coordinates differential of such involution obviously satisfies @xmath370 .    in a general stratum @xmath33 hyperelliptic flat surfaces form a small subspace of nontrivial codimension . however , there are two special strata , namely , @xmath340 and @xmath341 , for which hyperelliptic flat surfaces form entire hyperelliptic connected components @xmath371 and @xmath372 correspondingly .    note that in the stratum @xmath341 there are hyperelliptic flat surfaces of two different types .",
    "a hyperelliptic involution @xmath373 may fix the conical points or might interchange them .",
    "it is not difficult to show that for flat surfaces from the connected component @xmath372 the hyperelliptic involution interchanges the conical singularities .",
    "the remaining family of those hyperelliptic flat surfaces in @xmath341 , for which the hyperelliptic involution keeps the saddle points fixed , forms a subspace of nontrivial codimension in the complement @xmath374 .",
    "thus , the hyperelliptic connected component @xmath372 does not coincide with the space of all hyperelliptic flat surfaces .",
    "each of the strata @xmath396 , @xmath397 of the moduli space of flat surfaces of genus @xmath398 has two connected components : the hyperelliptic one , and one having odd spin structure .",
    "the other strata are connected for genus @xmath398 .          as a much more serious accessible introduction to teichmller dynamics",
