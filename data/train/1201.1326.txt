    "<S> the adsorption of 1,4-benzenediamine ( bda ) on the au(111 ) surface and azobenzene on the ag(111 ) surface is investigated using density functional theory ( dft ) with a non - local density functional ( vdw - df ) and a semi - local perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional . </S>",
    "<S> for bda on au(111 ) , the inclusion of london dispersion interactions not only dramatically enhances the molecule - substrate binding , resulting in adsorption energies consistent with experimental results , but also significantly alters the bda binding geometry . for azobenzene on ag(111 ) , the vdw - df produces superior adsorption energies compared to those obtained with other dispersion corrected dft approaches . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide evidence for the applicability of the vdw - df method and serves as a practical benchmark for the investigation of molecules adsorbed on noble metal surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the fundamental interactions that bind organic molecules to noble metal substrates is of crucial importance in molecular - scale electronics and self - assembly , where the competition between molecule - substrate and intermolecular interactions can lead to templated arrangements with specific spectroscopic and transport properties.@xcite as the forces driving the formation of these organic - inorganic assemblies often include both local chemical bonding and non - specific long - range interactions , it is essential to have an accurate description of both contributions ( e.g.  ref  ) . while density functional theory ( dft ) provides a many - particle framework that , in principle , incorporates both local and nonlocal interactions , common semi - local approximations to dft neglect long - range attractive contributions to van der waals interactions , so - called london dispersion forces.@xcite however , in recent years , progress has been made towards including london dispersion corrections within standard dft . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches run the gamut from semi - empirical methods to the development of more accurate exchange - correlation functionals.@xcite among these methods , a fully first - principles van der waals density functional ( vdw - df )  @xcite has been developed to accurately include the effects of london dispersion forces . </S>",
    "<S> this method has been shown to be relatively accurate as well as computationally tractable and , as such , has been applied with success to a wide range of systems including the adsorption and wetting of various surfaces.@xcite    in the present work , we perform dft calculations , with and without long - range london dispersion corrections , to investigate the adsorption of 1,4-benzenediamine ( bda ) and azobenzene on the ( 111 ) surfaces of au and ag . in the bda / au(111 ) system , we demonstrate that inclusion of dispersion forces via the recent vdw - df results in enhancements to molecule - substrate binding , bringing predictions for adsorption energies into agreement with experimental results .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , use of the vdw - df significantly alters the preferred orientation of the molecule relative to the au(111 ) surface , resulting in a preference for a flat adsorption geometry over the tilted configuration previously obtained with a generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite likewise , in the azobenzene / ag(111 ) system , vdw - df results in better adsorption energies than those obtained with other semi - empirical dispersion corrections . </S>",
    "<S> compared with experiment@xcite and complementing previous vdw - df studies of flat molecules on au(111 ) surfaces,@xcite our results provide evidence for the utility of vdw - df for studies of molecule - metal binding .    </S>",
    "<S> our dft calculations used both the vdw - df@xcite and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite gga to compare the effects of dispersion interactions on the adsorption of molecules to noble metal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations of bda molecules on au(111 ) were performed using a 408 ev planewave cutoff and ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite as implemented in a modified version of the quantum espresso simulation package ( qe ver . </S>",
    "<S> 4.2.1).@xcite ( the vdw - df module was obtained from the siesta simulation package.@xcite ) calculations of azobenzene molecules on ag(111 ) were performed with the vasp ( 5.2.12 ) simulation package , employing a 500 ev plane - wave cut off and paw potentials.@xcite for both systems , a periodic 4-atom - layer slab with 20   of vacuum and a 2@xmath02@xmath01 monkhorst - pack _ </S>",
    "<S> k_-point mesh were used ; both are found to result in converged energetics and binding geometries . during relaxations , the bottom two layers are fixed and all other atoms were allowed to relax unconstrained until the forces on each atom were less than 3 mev /  .    </S>",
    "<S> our computed au lattice constants are 4.14   ( pbe ) , and 4.25   ( vdw - df ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the overestimate of the lattice constant relative to experiment ( 4.08   ) within vdw - df has been noted before@xcite and was attributed to excessive exchange ( resulting in unphysically strong short range repulsion ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find similar agreement with experiment for the bulk ag lattice constant yielding values of 4.16  , and 4.26   within the pbe and vdw - df . to model the au substrate , a 4-layer 4@xmath04 in - plane unit cell containing 64 au atoms was used . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  , we used a 4-layer ag slab with a 3@xmath06 in - plane unit cell of 72 ag atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> bda - au junctions have been intensely investigated as a prototype for understanding charge transport at the molecular scale.@xcite in a bda - au junction , amine groups preferentially bind to under - coordinated au atoms , resulting in well - defined conductance .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite temperature - dependent helium atom scattering experiments reported the binding energy ( be ) of a related but distinct system , sparse bda sub - monolayers adsorbed on flat au(111 ) substrates , as roughly 1 ev,@xcite stronger than the computed bond strength between an amine group and an under - coordinated au atom ( 0.4 - 0.7 ev).@xcite moreover , flat au(111 ) is expected to be chemically inert , and thus a primary contributor to the large adsorption energy is expected to be london dispersion interactions between the bda molecule and the au substrate . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions were not explicitly accounted for in previous calculations ( see ref .  ) . in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we use calculations with the vdw - df and the pbe functional to compare their performance with experiment , and to better understand the role of nonlocal , dispersion forces on bda adsorption .    </S>",
    "<S> the amine groups at either end of the gas - phase bda molecule adopt a pyramidal structure with two h atoms located on one side of the phenyl plane and an electron lone pair on the other . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , bda is stable in both the _ trans_- or in the _ cis_- structure ( see fig .  [ f : bda_angle_dependence]a ) .    , within pbe ( black @xmath1 ) and vdw - df ( red @xmath2 ) for _ trans_-bda on au(111).,width=3 ]    </S>",
    "<S> adsorption energies of a </S>",
    "<S> _ trans_-bda on au(111 ) as a function of tilt angle relative to the surface are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : bda_angle_dependence]b , where @xmath3 denotes the angle between the phenyl plane of bda and the au surface . for each angle , each of the atoms within the bda molecule is constrained to preserve the tilt angle with the surface . using this approach , the pbe energetic minimum </S>",
    "<S> is found to be @xmath4 with a binding energy of 0.37 ev . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the vdw - df calculations exhibited significant increases in the adsorption energies as well as a shift in the tilt angle to 15@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently the inclusion of nonlocal dispersion interactions results in the molecule being effectively pulled closer to the au surface .    to obtain accurate equilibrium adsorption energies and optimized configurations , full structural relaxations </S>",
    "<S> are also performed . for pbe ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : bda_tilt_relaxed](a ) ) , we find that the adsorption energy is 0.41 ev with a n - au surface atom distance of 2.55   ( at a tilt angle of 29@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results agree with those reported previously,@xcite where the binding was attributed to a weak but non - negligible amine - au bond . on the other hand , for vdw - df ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : bda_tilt_relaxed]b ) the adsorption energy is 0.94 ev , in good agreement with the experimental value of 1 ev . here </S>",
    "<S> the n - au distance is 3.12  significantly larger than the pbe result . for the relaxed _ trans _ molecule on the au(111 ) surface , we find that the tilt angle is now 8@xmath5 with the four amine h atoms located at the same height relative to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the phenyl plane tilt is attributable to the _ trans_-structure rather than the amine - au interaction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : bda_tilt_relaxed]b ) .        </S>",
    "<S> bda can also bind to the au(111 ) surface ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : bda_separation]a ) in the _ cis_-conformation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we find that pbe and vdw - df give similar lowest energy geometries , with the four n - bonded h atoms pointing towards the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of adsorption energy on the bda - au(111 ) separation is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : bda_separation]b . </S>",
    "<S> pbe calculations find an optimum separation distance of 3.71   with a binding energy of 0.39 ev , similar to the tilted structure discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> vdw - df calculations predict an optimal separation of 3.57   , and an adsorption energy of 0.98 ev , slightly stronger than that of the vdw - df tilted _ trans_-configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the similar binding energies between the _ cis_- and _ trans_- conformations obtained using pbe , leading to meta - stable tilts , emphasize the fact that the molecule - surface interactions are dominated by dispersion forces , which stabilize flat adsorption geometries . furthermore , the large enhancement in binding energies within vdw - df ( 0.60 ev ) further confirms the need for an accurate treatment of non - local interactions in investigations of metal - molecule interfaces .        </S>",
    "<S> consideration of the adsorption of _ </S>",
    "<S> cis_-bda at different sites on the au(111 ) surface indicates that the au(111 ) surface is energetically flat for bda molecules , i.e. the adsorption energies for different sites are similar ( @xmath6 10 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the ordering of binding sites within vdw - df differs from pbe , in both cases the differences between sites is very small , essentially on the order of the expected dft error . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are expected for the _ trans_-configuration .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) . computed binding energy curves for azobenzene on ag(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental and theoretical results from ref .   are shown . </S>",
    "<S> vdw - df ( this work ) produces a be in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption height is however overestimated by 16% , as discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to compare with our bda - au(111 ) calculations and further assess the efficacy of the vdw - df , we also compute the equilibrium adsorption geometry and be for a related molecule , azobenzene , on the ag(111 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> this system is chosen not only because its optical - structural properties have attracted significant attention,@xcite but also due to the recent availability of experimental measurements of its adsorption energetics . </S>",
    "<S> mercurio _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reported both the binding geometry and adsorption energy of azobenzene on ag(111 ) using a normal - incidence x - ray standing wave ( nixsw ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> they find that upon adsorption the n - ag distance is 3.07 @xmath7 0.02  and that the molecule lies flat relative to the surface ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they measured an adsorption energy of 1.0 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this value was obtained through an examination of the coverage dependence of thermally programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments . </S>",
    "<S> their work was also compared with several first principles approaches , including pbe - gga @xcite but also the dispersion - corrected methods of grimme@xcite and tkatchenko - scheffler@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( these prior results are reproduced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : azobenzene_desorption ] for comparison ) .    </S>",
    "<S> using vdw - df , we compute an azobenzene - ag(111 ) be of 0.98 ev , in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast with the small be predicted by pbe ( 0.1 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the larger discrepancy between pbe and vdw - df be for azobenzene ( compared with bda ) is consistent with its _ two _ polarizable aromatic rings ( rather than just one ) . </S>",
    "<S> like pbe however , the vdw - df predicted adsorption height is too large ( by about 0.5  ) . although this is an improvement over pbe ( a 26% overestimate ) , the adsorption height is still an order of magnitude larger than typical errors associated with dft bond lengths </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with vdw - dfs typical overestimation of separation distances ( a consequence of excessively repulsive exchange interactions  @xcite ) . our computed value for @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> f : azobenzene_desorption ] ) is also consistent with the experimental measurement . as with bda on au </S>",
    "<S> , the site dependence of the be seems to be small . </S>",
    "<S> results are nearly identical when one of the n atoms is placed above an atop site ( d@xmath10 = 3.63 and be=0.97 ev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since both the adsorption height and angle have been measured experimentally , we can also examine how well vdw - df describes the interactions between the aromatic ring and the surface at fixed d@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> when we constrain d@xmath10 to the experimental value and relax the system , the be is reduced to 0.9 ev , and the aromatic rings tilt an angle of 6@xmath5 relative to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it appears that the interaction between the aromatic group is too repulsive within vdw - df .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible source of the height overestimate may stem from the fact that within the vdw - df functional , the equilibrium lattice constant for bulk ag is 4.26    ( vdw - df2 gives 4.32   ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is larger than what pbe predicts ( 4.16  ) , which is itself already too large compared to experiment ( 4.08  ) . to test this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the vdw - df equilibrium height and be of azobenzene on a silver slab constructed with the smaller pbe lattice constant ; we find that the adsorption height is 3.64   , and the be is 0.98 ev . </S>",
    "<S> using a variant of vdw - df which performs better at predicting the bulk lattice constant of ag ( optb86b+vdw - df@xcite , 4.11  ) results in poorer performance . </S>",
    "<S> our computed be and height with optb86b+vdw - df are 1.54 ev and 2.85   respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained when applying the c09x exchange functional with vdw - df ( c09x+vdw - df@xcite ) for bda on the au ( 111 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> here , the c09x+vdw - df gives an excellent au lattice constant ( 4.09  ) , but overbinds by the same order of magnitude as obtb86b - vdw - df . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the delicate balance between short and long range forces which must be achieved when developing transferable functionals capable of accurately describing heterogeneous interfaces .    in conclusion , we have used dft calculations to investigate the influence of london dispersion interactions on the adsorption of 1,4-benzenediamine ( bda ) on au(111 ) and azobenzene on ag(111 ) . a non - local vdw density functional ( vdw - df ) </S>",
    "<S> was used to determine adsorption energies and the corresponding molecular configurations . in the bda / au(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> system , we find that inclusion of vdw interactions produces adsorption energies consistent with experimental results , significantly enhancing molecule - substrate binding over pbe and stabilizing flat adsorption geometries . in the azobenzene / ag(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> system , vdw - df results in better binding energies compared to other dispersion corrected functionals , albeit with some overestimation of adsorption height ( @xmath1116% ) . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides evidence for the relevance of the vdw - df approach for the structure and stability of metal - molecule binding . </S>"
