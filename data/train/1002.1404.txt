    "our study is restricted to the symmetric case ( i.e.  the case where isim is invariant under particle - hole symmetry ) .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ anderson - kondo ] introduces universal aspects which characterize the anderson model and are relevant for quantum dots where spin or orbital kondo effects occur . the studied spinless model with inversion symmetry ( isim )",

    "a second transformation is performed in section  [ nrg chain ] , based on the usual logarithmic discretization of the energy band of the leads , to get the final model used for the nrg study .",
    "the study is restricted to the case with particle - hole symmetry in section  [ symmetric case ] .",
    "the low energy excitations are first considered as a function of the temperature in section  [ three fixed points ] . when @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the level width of the scattering region , the 3 fixed points [ free orbital ( fo ) , local moment ( lm ) and strong coupling ( sc ) ] characterizing the anderson model without field are recovered when @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , the lm fixed point characterizing the model above the kondo temperature @xmath13 disappears . in section  [ free fermion fixed points ] , we study the low energy excitations of isim as a function of @xmath1 in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "we find that they can always be described by a set of effective one - body excitations , showing that a continuous line of free fermion fixed points goes from the sc limit of the anderson model ( @xmath38 ) towards a new simple limit : the polarized orbital ( po ) fixed point ( @xmath5 ) . between the sc and po fixed points , we show in section  [ characteristic energy scale ] that there is always an intermediate value @xmath6 of @xmath1 for which isim is perfectly transmitting .",

    "this method based on friedel sum rule ( fsr ) contains an assumption .",

    "the anderson model describes a single site with hubbard interaction @xmath0 coupled to a 3d bath of conduction electrons .",
    "this is one of the quantum impurity models @xcite which were introduced to study the resistance minimum observed in metals with magnetic impurities .",
    "the kondo problem refers to the failure of perturbative techniques to describe this minimum .",
    "the solution of these models by the nrg algorithm , a non - perturbative technique @xcite introduced by wilson , is at the origin of the discovery of universal behaviors which can emerge from many - body effects . without magnetic field @xmath16 and with particle - hole symmetry",

    "moreover , quantum dots open the possibility to study the kondo effect as a function of the coupling between the impurity and the continuum of conduction electrons , and not only as functions of the temperature and of the magnetic field . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", this gives the opportunity to do the spectroscopy of the kondo problem .",
    "notably , the weak to strong coupling crossover can be studied by varying gate voltages , when metallic gates are used for creating quantum dots .",
    "kondo physics was first related to the antiferromagnetic coupling between a magnetic impurity and the spin of the host s conduction electrons .",
    "this is why kondo physics was first expected and seen @xcite in quantum dots with odd numbers of electrons , weakly coupled to leads .",
    "however , it was realized that a localized electronic state coupled to a continuum can give rise to a large class of different kondo effects , including the original spin-@xmath51 kondo effect , various orbital kondo effects and the su(4 ) kondo effect occurring if a spin kondo effect co - exists with an orbital kondo effect .    in this framework , isim is a model which can be used for describing the quantum conductance of spin polarized electrons in an inversion - symmetric double - dot setup with strong capacitive inter - dot coupling , as a function of the inter - dot hopping @xmath1 .",
    "for such a setup , @xmath1 could be varied by electrostatic gates if the two dots are coupled by a quantum point contact , and our study describes the effect of this coupling upon the orbital kondo effect induced by the inversion symmetry . eventually , universal aspects of many - body phenomena characterize not only equilibrium quantum transport , but also non - equilibrium quantum transport which occurs in the presence of a large source - drain bias @xmath52",
    ". measures of the conductance @xcite and of the current noise @xcite of kondo dots have recently confirmed the expected universality if one measures @xmath48 or @xmath52 in units of @xmath13 .",
    "we describe here another universal aspect of linear quantum transport , i.e. , the quantum conductance of a spin polarized inversion symmetric double - dot setup should be a universal function of the dimensionless inter - dot hopping @xmath53 when @xmath24 .",
    "kondo physics is also at the origin of spinless models , as the interacting resonant level model @xcite ( irlm ) which describes a resonant level ( @xmath54 ) coupled to two baths of spinless electrons via tunneling junctions and an interaction @xmath0 between the level and the baths .",
    "irlm , which is now used for studying non - equilibrium quantum transport @xcite , is related to the kondo model , the charge states @xmath55 playing the role of spin states .",
    "both isim and irlm are inversion symmetric .",
    "however , the zeeman field acting on the impurity is played by the hopping term @xmath1 for isim , and by the site energy @xmath56 for irlm .",
    "therefore , isim does not transmit the electrons without `` field '' , while irlm does .",
    "though we study in this work a finite density of particles , let us mention that the two - particle scattering problem has been solved @xcite for isim .",

    ", this corresponds to a nanosystem level spacing @xmath304 .",
    "this result shown using isim is a particular illustration of the minimal realization of the orbital kondo effect in a quantum dot with two leads , which has been studied by silvestrov and imry  @xcite for more general setups .",
    "the role of the conduction electron spin is played by the lead index in ref .  , while it is played by the even and odd orbitals for isim . in the two cases",
    ", the kondo effect takes place if there are two close levels in a dot populated by a single electron , and the conductance at @xmath49 is zero at the su(2 ) symmetric point ( @xmath38 for isim ) , while it reaches the unitary limit @xmath305 for some finite value @xmath306 of the level splitting @xmath307 .",
    "however , the prediction made in ref .  , that for temperature @xmath308 the conductance becomes maximal if the levels are exactly degenerate , can not be valid for isim where level degeneracy means no coupling between the left and right leads ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have shown that the quantum conductance of an interacting nanosystem coupled to non - interacting 1d leads can be described with a universal function @xmath28 .",
    "this concept , with a similar function @xmath28 , must remain valid if one couples the nanosystem to non - interacting 2d or 3d leads instead of strictly 1d leads .",
    "this can be understood if one considers the anderson models of pseudo - spin @xmath51 particles corresponding to isim with leads of dimension d. the kondo physics of such models , where the quantum impurity is coupled to a bath of dimension d , is qualitatively independent of the used bath .",
    "a change of the dimension of the leads modifies only the dependence of the nanosystem level width @xmath298 upon @xmath2 ( @xmath309 in all dimensions d , but with factors which depend on d ) , and hence the dependence of the kondo temperature upon @xmath2 .",
    "this makes likely that the universal aspects of @xmath3 obtained in a pure 1d limit using isim do characterize also more general spinless models , where the nanosystem and the leads would be created in gated 2d semiconductor heterostructures . in that case , isim is a simplified model which could describe quantum transport of spin polarized electrons through an inversion - symmetric double - dot setup , as a function of the inter - dot coupling .",
    "since such a coupling can be easily varied if the two dots are coupled by a quantum point contact , it will be interesting to check whether the quantum conductance of such setup is given by a universal function of the dimensionless inter - dot coupling @xmath53 when @xmath24 . for observing the orbital kondo regime using such a setup",
    ", a large capacitive inter - dot coupling will be necessary .",
    "it will be also interesting to introduce the spin 1/2 of electrons in isim for studying the role of @xmath1 upon the su(4)-kondo effect , as we have studied its role upon the su(2)-kondo effect using spinless fermions .",
    "the possibility of observing su(4)-symmetric fermi liquid state in a symmetric double quantum dot system with strong capacitive inter - dot coupling has been discussed in ref .  .",
    "eventually , this study was restricted to the symmetric case , leaving to a following work the study of the asymmetric case ( @xmath310 , @xmath311 ) , where the role of @xmath1 upon the valence - fluctuation fixed point remains to be investigated ."
