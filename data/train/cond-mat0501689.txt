    "quantum phase transitions from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state in two and three dimensional itinerant electron system have been studied extensively in the past @xcite . the standard approach in studying such systems , first advocated by hertz @xcite , involves two steps .",
    "first , one decouples the electron - electron interaction term in the hamiltonian using a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation .",
    "next , the fermions are integrated out to obtain an effective landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory in terms of the fm order parameter which provides an effective description of the transition .",
    "however , it has been recently pointed out that the procedure of integrating out the gapless fermions in the above mentioned scheme might be tricky @xcite .",
    "in particular , it might lead to singular terms in the effective lg functional which can change the critical property of the transition .",
    "in contrast , very little attention has been paid to such transitions in one dimension ( 1d ) , partly due to the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite which states that the ground states of one - dimensional hubbard models with nearest - neighbor hopping and density dependent short - range interaction are always spin singlets .",
    "however , numerical work carried out in ref .  , has shown that the presence of a next - nearest - neighbor hopping term in the above mentioned class of models can result in a fm ground state .",
    "the properties of such fm luttinger liquids has been studied in detail in ref .  .",
    "recently , a bosonization analysis has also been carried out to study the paramagnetic - fm transition in 1d hubbard models with ising symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is shown that in @xmath4 , the critical theory is below its upper critical dimension and is governed by an interacting fixed point .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in ref .   from analysis of rotor models of ferromagnets .    in this work ,",
    "we carry out a similar analysis which applies for heisenberg ferromagnets by explicitly keeping track of the full su(2 ) symmetry of the model .",
    "in particular , we show that at the gaussian level , the presence of a berry phase term in the effective action of such ferromagnets does not change the dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 of the transition : @xmath6 in the @xmath1 expansion sense .",
    "we point out that in spite of the same value of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 at the gaussian level , the universality class of this transition can be different from its ising counterpart .",
    "our analysis also shows that contrary to the claim of ref .",
    ", the critical theory for ising symmetry can be obtained by the standard hertz - millis procedure and in 1d such a procedure is identical to the bosonization approach for ising fm quantum critical points . however , for the su(2 ) case , it appears that the critical theory may not be described by the standard hertz - millis procedure .",
    "we also consider the effect of the fm critical fluctuations on the electron green function at finite temperature .",
    "we obtain an exact expression for the electron green functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 in a temperature range , which can be accessed experimentally by measuring the tunneling density of states ( dos ) and the momentum distribution function respectively .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we obtain the effective action for 1d quantum ferromagnets with heisenberg symmetry at the gaussian level and determine @xmath5 by analyzing this action .",
    "then we discuss the interacting fixed point in the @xmath1-expansion sense and the issue of universality of the ising and heisenberg cases in the light of possible quartic couplings .",
    "this is followed by sec .",

    "next we comment on the universality class of the transition . to determine the universality class ,",
    "since we are below the upper critical dimension of the theory , we need to retain the possible fourth order diagrams while integrating out fermions in eq.[fermlast ] .",
    "two such representative diagrams are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the diagram in the left panel is present for the ising ferromagnets studied in ref .  , while that in the right panel is a consequence of the heisenberg symmetry of the problem .",
    "after some algebra @xcite , one can show that the diagram in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] generates ising type contributions @xmath136 while the diagram in the right panel generates , for example , quartic couplings @xmath137 ( apart from other similar quartic and higher order terms ) .",
    "the former type of terms are exactly those that are expected at quartic order for the ising ferromagnets , either from a bosonization analysis @xcite or hertz - millis approach @xcite .",
    "therefore , our analysis shows that the standard hertz - millis procedure in 1d , gives exactly the same critical theory as obtained in ref .   by bosonization for the ising case .",
    "the latter type of diagrams are absent in the ising model studied in ref .  .",
    "in the fm phases , where the amplitude mode is gapped , these terms represents a trivial renormalization of the parameters such as spin - wave stiffness of @xmath68 ( eq.[nlsm ] ) .",
    "near the transition , they generate quartic coupling between the amplitude and the spin - wave modes .",
    "notice that these terms are different from the standard @xmath138 quartic terms expected from the usual hertz - millis analysis of a heisenberg magnet with a vector order parameter .",
    "we expect such quartic coupling terms to change the universality class of the transition from that of ising ferromagnets .",
    "a determination of the universality class would therefore require a detailed analysis of eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] supplemented with all such possible relevant quartic coupling terms .",
    "in particular , this requires a consideration of both coupled longitudinal and transverse modes at the same footing . in this work",
    ", we shall be content with pointing out the necessity of such an analysis .",
    "the quartic terms mentioned above makes the gaussian fixed point , described by eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] , unstable .",
    "however , all such diagrams , including the ising type quartic terms , are non - zero only when the fermionic dispersion has a finite curvature @xcite .",
    "thus , above a temperature scale set by this curvature , the properties of the system is expected to be well described by the gaussian theory described by eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] .",
    "we discuss this point in more details in the next section .",
    "it is well known that the presence of a quantum critical point shows up in experimentally accessible quantities such as tunneling dos and the momentum distribution function of the electrons . to obtain these quantities",
    "one needs to estimate the effect of critical fluctuations on the electron green function .",
    "however , the fixed point concerned here is an interacting one .",
    "this means to compute the electron green function at @xmath139 near the critical point , one needs to solve the problem of electrons coupled to @xmath140 bosons . for the ising ferromagnets",

    "obtaining the electron green function coupled with these interacting bosons , even for the ising ferromagnets , is a difficult task .",
    "however , it might be still be possible to compute the properties of green function at finite temperature using the gaussian fixed point , if the rg flow , which can be computed for ising ferromagnets from eq .",
    "[ rgac ] , generated by temperature takes us to a regime where @xmath143 , where @xmath144^{1/4}$ ] is the thermal wavevector and @xmath145 is the value of the coupling @xmath142 at the interacting fixed point .    to explain the last sentence a little better",
    ", we consider the rg flow of the action @xmath30 ( eq .  [ rgac ] ) at finite temperature , to one loop . as noted in ref .  , the flow of @xmath142 and @xmath146 are negligible as @xmath147 flows away from the fixed point according to @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the scaled temperature",
    ". therefore we may envisage that when @xmath1 is small , there will be a temperature @xmath150 , above which @xmath151 , so that the effect of interaction can be neglected .",
    "the key question is then whether at and above @xmath150 , @xmath152 is small compared to the @xmath153 term in @xmath30 ( eq .  [ rgac ] ) .",
    "a simple estimate shows that for this to happen , we need to be below a temperature @xmath154 given by @xmath155 for @xmath156 , @xmath147 can not be neglected and the behavior of the system is similar to that of a luttinger liquid at finite temperature .",
    "if indeed @xmath157 , there exists a finite window where the effect of the critical fluctuations on the electron green function can be calculated neglecting the effect of interaction . we refrain from estimating @xmath150 and @xmath154 since they need the knowledge of precise value of @xmath145 and is therefore non - universal in the rg sense",
    ", in the rest of this section , we shall assume that such a window exists and compute the behavior of the electron green function for @xmath158 .",

    "[ q1exp ] and [ q2exp ] can be calculated analytically and one gets at @xmath197 , @xmath198 from eq .",
    "[ llg ] , one can identify @xmath199 to be the anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "note that , as is well known for luttinger liquids , the green functions @xmath180 and @xmath200 has identical behavior . this is a consequence of the linear dispersion of the bosonic density fluctuations .",
    "as we approach the critical point , @xmath201 , and consequently one must retain the @xmath202 term , in the expression of @xmath191 . when @xmath203 , it is not possible to evaluate @xmath204 analytically at finite temperature .",
    "however , since the electrons now see the critical bosonic fluctuations with dispersions @xmath205 , we expect the green functions @xmath206 and @xmath200 to have different behavior . a plot of the green functions shown in figs",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , confirms the above qualitative discussion .",
    "the characteristic scale of decay for @xmath180 is seen to be much shorter compared to @xmath200 .",
    "this feature arises from the presence of critical fluctuations with @xmath207 dispersion ( in contrast to @xmath208 fluctuations in standard luttinger liquid ) and is therefore a signature of the quantum critical point at finite temperature .",
    "we expect that a measurement of @xmath175 and @xmath209 will probe this behavior .",
    "in this work , we have shown , by explicitly keeping track of the full su(2 ) symmetry of the problem , that in 1d the luttinger liquid to fm transition for heisenberg ferromagnets has @xmath6 in an @xmath1 expansion sense .",
    "the analysis done here was carried out at a gaussian level , which is exact in 1d as long as the dispersion of the fermions are linear .",
    "the curvature in fermionic dispersion introduces quartic coupling terms beyond the gaussian approximation .",
    "although we have not carried out a full analysis of the problem with such coupling terms in the presence of the su(2 ) symmetry , we have identified the typical quartic terms and discuss their consequences .",
    "in particular , we pointed out that for a ferromagnet with ising symmetry , our analysis reduces to the standard hertz - millis theory .",
    "the hertz - millis approach is therefore completely equivalent to the bosonization approach of ref . in 1d for ising ferromagnets .",
    "in contrast , we find that for the heisenberg ferromagnets , our theory does not reduce to that obtained by the traditional hertz - millis approach .",
    "we identify that this is due to additional coupling terms between the longitudinal and the transverse modes , shown in right panel of fig.[fig1 ] , which has no analog in the ising case and are also different from the usual expected @xmath138 interaction terms that one obtains using the hertz - millis approach .",
    "it will be interesting to carry out our analysis in higher dimension and compare the results with those of ref .  , where a possible problem with such @xmath138 quartic terms in the usual hertz - millis approach has been discussed from a different point of view .",
    "a detailed analysis of this issue is left as a subject of future work .",
    "we have also obtained an exact expression for the electron green functions @xmath180 and @xmath200 for a range of finite temperature .",
    "although we have not obtained the expression of the green functions at the interacting fixed point , we hope that over a range of temperature where the properties of the system is expected to be well described by the gaussian fixed point , @xmath180 and @xmath200 can be probed by experimentally accessible quantities such as the momentum distribution and tunneling dos of the electrons .",
    "this work was supported by nserc of canada , canada research chair program , and canadian institute for advanced research .",
    "we thank kedar damle , dima feldman , subir sachdev , and kun yang for their insightful comments and eugene kim for early collaboration on a related project .",
    "the procedure of obtaining a non - linear sigma model for a gapped quasi one - dimensional system is outlined in ref .. we follow this procedure here and set the gap @xmath210 to zero at the end of the calculation . however",
    ", this also means that the domain of validity of such the model , which is valid for @xmath211 , shrinks to zero .",
    "this implies that the coefficients of the model such as spin stiffness and susceptibility can not be trusted .",
    "as far as our analysis here is concerned , it does not depend on the precise values of these coefficients and is expected to hold as long as the coefficients remain non - singular .",
    "we do not know of any analysis which rigorously derives an effective model of spin fluctuation for a metallic system .",
    "note that to obtain @xmath112 , one proceeds exactly the same way as for @xmath212 .",
    "we first obtain @xmath213 for @xmath214 , then switch over to the symmetric and antisymmetric modes @xmath215 and finally integrate out the anti - symmetric modes to get @xmath112 .    the use of dressed , rather than the bare propagator of the gauge field is crucial here and can be justified as an attempt to take into account self - consistency of the problem . of course , in general , it is not necessary that this procedure will lead to self - consistency . for the problem at hand ,",
    "however , it can be checked a posteriori that the use of dressed propagator for the gauge fields indeed gives us a self - consistent solution in the infrared limit ."
