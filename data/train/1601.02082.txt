    "by deploying tens to hundreds of antennas at the base station ( bs ) and simultaneously serving multiple users in the same time - frequency resource block , massive multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) achieves unprecedented gain in both spectral efficiency and radiated energy efficiency , accommodating the stringent requirements of future 5 g systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the performance gains , however , come at the expense of a linear increase in hardware cost as well as circuitry power consumption , and therefore massive mimo will be more attractive if low - cost , energy - efficient solutions are available .      basically , if each bs antenna is configured with an unabridged radio frequency ( rf ) chain , then the only way to alleviate hardware cost and circuitry power consumption is to use economical low - power components when building the rf chains .",
    "these components , however , generally have to tolerate severe impairments , such as quantization noise , nonlinearity of power amplifier , phase noise of oscillator , and i / q imbalance . by modeling the aggregate effect of the impairments ( including quantization noise ) as an additional gaussian noise independent of the desired signal , the authors of @xcite investigated the impact of hardware impairments on the system spectral efficiency and radiated energy efficiency , and concluded that massive mimo exhibits some degree of resilience against hardware impairments .",
    "further , employing a similar model the authors of @xcite derived a scaling law that reveals the tradeoff among hardware cost , circuitry power consumption , and the level of impairments .",
    "although the adopted stochastic impairment models are not rigorous theoretically ( for example , the quantization noise inherently depends on the desired signal ) , the analytical results in @xcite-@xcite closely match those obtained by a more accurate hardware - specific deterministic model , as demonstrated by @xcite .    among all the components in a rf chain , high - resolution adc ( typically with a bit - width exceeding 10 ) is particularly power - hungry , especially for wideband systems , since the power consumption of an adc scales roughly exponentially with the bit - width and linearly with the baseband bandwidth @xcite . lowering the bit - width of the adopted adc will therefore bring in considerable savings on cost and energy .",
    "this fact actually has motivated extensive research on low - cost , energy - efficient design of wireless communication systems through employing low - resolution or even one - bit adcs to build the rf chain ; see , e.g. , @xcite for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels , @xcite for ultra - wideband channels , and @xcite-@xcite for mimo channels .",
    "regarding massive mimo , the impact of coarse quantization has been investigated only recently . in @xcite",
    ", the authors evaluated the achievable rates of an uplink one - bit massive mimo system adopting qpsk constellation , least - squares ( ls ) channel estimation , and maximum ratio combiner ( mrc ) or zero - forcing combiner ( zfc ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite-@xcite further revealed that enhancement of achievable rates can be attained by high - order modulation such as 16-qam .",
    "the underlying reason is that , even for one - bit massive mimo , the amplitude of the transmit signal can still be recovered provided that the number of bs antennas is sufficiently large and that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is not too high .",
    "optimizations of pilot length and adc bit - width were performed in @xcite and @xcite respectively , both adopting mrc at the receiver .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite analyzed the achievable rates of one - bit massive mimo in frequency - selective channels , employing linear minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) channel estimator and linear combiners such as mrc and zfc .",
    "beyond that , various channel estimation and data detection algorithms have been proposed for massive mimo under coarse quantization .",
    "for example , near maximum likelihood ( nml ) detector and channel estimator were proposed in @xcite for one - bit massive mimo in frequency - flat fading channels . in @xcite ,",
    "channel estimation and data detection algorithms were developed for quantized massive mimo in frequency - selective fading channels .",
    "particularly , tradeoffs between error rate performance and computational complexity were investigated therein based on mismatched quantization models .",
    "techniques based on message passing algorithm ( and its variants ) were also applied to quantized massive mimo systems , such as @xcite-@xcite for frequency - flat fading channels and @xcite-@xcite for frequency - selective fading channels . in general , @xcite-@xcite conclude that massive mimo is somewhat robust to coarse quantization , validating the potential of building massive mimo by low - resolution adcs .      except @xcite , all the aforementioned works have assumed a homogeneous - adc architecture ; that is , all the antennas at the bs are equipped with low - resolution adcs of the same bit - width .",
    "although such an architecture seems feasible in terms of achievable rate or bit error rate ( ber ) , it has several practical issues , including data rate loss in the high snr regime @xcite-@xcite , error floor for linear multi - user detection with 1 - 3 bit quantized outputs @xcite-@xcite , overhead and challenge of channel estimation @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and of time - frequency synchronization @xcite from quantized outputs . from this perspective",
    ", high - resolution adcs can still be useful for effective design of massive mimo receivers .",
    "motivated by such consideration , in early works @xcite-@xcite we have proposed a mixed - adc architecture for massive mimo , where a small proportion of the high - resolution adcs are reserved while the others are replaced by one - bit adcs . for frequency - flat channels",
    ", @xcite shows that the mixed - adc architecture is able to achieve an attractive tradeoff between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency .",
    "moreover , compared with the homogeneous - adc architecture , the mixed - adc architecture is inherently immune to most of the aforementioned concerns .",
    "for example , channel estimation and time - frequency synchronization in the mixed - adc architecture are more tractable than those in the homogeneous - adc architecture @xcite , benefiting from the reserved high - resolution adcs .",
    "it is perhaps also worth noting that the mixed - adc architecture is much more flexible to the time - varying property of the users demand for mobile data traffic . to be specific ,",
    "when the users sum rate requirement is low , part of the bs antennas can be deactivated .",
    "then high - resolution adcs may be adopted in the channel training phase while one - bit adcs may be employed in the data transmission phase .",
    "compared with the homogeneous - adc architecture , the mixed - adc architecture in this situation incurs much lower channel estimation overhead and will therefore achieve higher energy efficiency .      in this paper , we leverage the information - theoretical tool of generalized mutual information ( gmi ) to quantify the achievable rates of the mixed - adc architecture in frequency - selective channels .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we modify the mixed - adc architecture to make it suitable for frequency - selective channels , adopting ofdm to handle inter - symbol interference ( isi ) and a linear frequency - domain equalizer to mitigate inter - carrier interference ( ici ) . * for static simo channels , we derive an explicit expression of the gmi , and based on which further optimize the linear frequency - domain equalizer .",
    "the analytical results are then extended to ergodic time - varying simo channels , where tight lower and upper bounds of the gmi are derived .",
    "the impact of frequency diversity and imperfect csi on the system performance is investigated as well .",
    "* we then extend the analytical framework to the multi - user scenario .",
    "ber performance is also examined for a practical convolutional codec .",
    "* we develop a reduced - complexity algorithm , by which the computational complexity of the linear frequency - domain equalizer is reduced from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of bs antennas and @xmath3 is the number of subcarriers .",
    "extensive numerical studies under various setups reveal that , with only a small proportion of high - resolution adcs , the mixed - adc architecture attains a large portion of the achievable rate of ideal conventional architecture , and significantly outperforms antenna selection with the same number of high - resolution adcs .",
    "in addition , the mixed - adc architecture in the multi - user scenario remarkably lowers the error floor encountered by one - bit massive mimo .",
    "these observations validate the merits of the mixed - adc architecture for effective design of massive mimo receivers .      throughout this paper , vectors and matrices",

    "@xmath299 for @xmath353 always approaches a zero matrix no matter which case it falls into , and consequently @xmath355 tends to be a zero matrix as well , since the unitary transformation @xmath31 does not change the frobenius norm of a matrix . in summary ,",
    "@xmath356    for the diagonal blocks , if @xmath308 , we have @xmath357 , and from it is obvious that @xmath358 . in other word , we have @xmath359 , for any @xmath308 . if @xmath311 , on the other hand , from and we obtain @xmath360 . then , applying it is straightforward to verify that @xmath361 .",

    "when @xmath104 and as @xmath67 grows without bound , we have @xmath368 for expositional concision , we denote the normalization of @xmath369 by @xmath370 , and accordingly define @xmath371^t$ ] .",
    "then @xmath372 in this situation approaches @xmath373 which is independent of @xmath67 .    on the other hand ,",
