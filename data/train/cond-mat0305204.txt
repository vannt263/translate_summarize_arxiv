    "most processes in living organisms are adjusted to function in a rather limited range of physiological conditions , and important deviations , such as high concentrations of dangerous substances , are generally expected to preclude life .",
    "nevertheless , many living systems survive stresses of this kind and exist in hostile environments .",
    "one common adaptation strategy is to modify the properties of the solvent , which is usually water , in such a way as to exclude the undesirable solutes from solution  @xcite .",
    "water is modified by relatively high concentrations of stabilising solutes ( cosolvents ) , which remain compatible with the metabolism of the cell even at very high concentrations ( therefore they are also referred to as ` compatible osmolytes ' )  @xcite .",
    "these cosolvents neutralise dangerous solutes by decreasing their solubility and enhancing the formation of their aggregates .",
    "such cosolvents are known as promoters of the water structure and are therefore referred to as kosmotropes ( ` kosmo - trope ' @xmath0 order maker ) .",
    "their stabilising function for proteins and aggregates of hydrophobic solute particles , and their importance for the osmotic balance in cells , has generated a growing interest in the physical origin of the kosmotropic effect .",
    "many recent investigations have focused on the ability of kosmotropic cosolvents to influence solute solubility in aqueous media  @xcite .    of equal interest and importance",
    "is the ability of chaotropic cosolvents to increase the solubility of non - polar solute particles in aqueous solutions  @xcite . for certain systems",
    "the solubility may be enhanced by several orders of magnitude  @xcite , leading to a complete destabilisation of solute aggregates and , in the case of protein solutions , to a complete denaturation and loss of function . a significant number of substances display this property , notably ( under most conditions and for the majority of solute species ) urea , which is frequently used in highly concentrated ( _ c_.  0.5 - 10 m ) solutions as a protein denaturant .",
    "chaotropic cosolvents ( ` chao - tropic ' @xmath0 order - breaking ) are less polar than water and thus break hydrogen bonds between water molecules , suppressing water structure formation  @xcite .",
    "however , the exact physical mechanism for the changes in water structure , and for the consequent destabilising action of chaotropic cosolvents , is at present not fully understood .    because the origin of the kosmotropic and chaotropic effects appears to lie primarily in their influence on the solvent , rather than in direct interactions between cosolvent and solute  @xcite",
    ", a microscopic description must begin with the unique properties of the aqueous medium .",
    "water molecules have the ability to form strong , intermolecular hydrogen bonds , and pure , liquid water may form extended hydrogen - bonded networks , becoming highly ordered ( fig .  [ figws ] ) .",
    "although the insertion of a hydrophobic molecule leads to a destruction of local hydrogen - bond structure , at low temperatures water molecules are found to rearrange in a cage - like configuration around small solute particles and around high - curvature regions of larger ones .",
    "the orientation imposed on the water molecules at the interface with the particle results in the cage hydrogen bonds being slightly stronger than before , and causing a net reduction of energy during the insertion process  @xcite . however , at higher temperatures the free energy of the system is decreased by reducing the local restructuring of water , thus increasing the entropy of the solvent molecules , which drives the aggregation of hydrophobic particles through a minimisation of their total surface exposed to water .",
    "this competition between enthalpic and entropic effects in the solvent is fundamental to the phenomenology of liquid - liquid demixing processes .",
    "the effective hydrophobic interaction between small , non - polar solute particles is thus thought to be primarily solvent - induced , _",
    "i.e. _  to be a consequence of changes in the ordering of water molecules rather than being controlled by direct water - solute interactions  @xcite . in this description ,",
    "the primary contribution to the action of structure - changing cosolvents , which are generally highly soluble and uncharged in physiological conditions , then depends on their ability to alter this local ordering of liquid water .",
    "kosmotropic cosolvents , such as sucrose and betaine , are more polar than water and act to enhance its structure due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds  @xcite .",
    "for the same reason they interact with water molecules rather than with non - polar solute particles , which leads to an effective preferential exclusion from the solvation shell of hydrophobic molecules  @xcite , and thus to a stronger net repulsion between solute and solvent . in the presence of kosmotropic cosolvents , structural arrangement of the water - cosolvent mixture is enthalpically favourable compared to a cage - like organisation around hydrophobic solute particles .",
    "solute molecules are thus pushed together to minimise their total exposed surface , which results in an enhancement of hydrophobic aggregation .",
    "the same process leads to a stabilisation of native protein configurations , in spite of the fact that kosmotropic substances have no net charge and do not interact directly with the proteins  @xcite .",
    "chaotropic cosolvents , such as urea in most ternary systems , are less polar than water , so that their presence in solution leads to an energetically unfavourable disruption of water structure .",
    "such cosolvents are therefore excluded from bulk water , an effect known as `` preferential binding '' to the solute particles  @xcite , although it relies less on any direct binding of cosolvent to solute ( which would enhance the effect ) than on the fact that the cosolvent molecules are pushed from the solvent into the shell regions of the solute .",
    "preferential binding and exclusion of cosolvent molecules are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fpref ] . in the former case",
    ", the smaller number of water molecules in contact with the surface of non - polar solute particles leads to a weaker effective interaction between solute and solvent , such that a larger mutual interface becomes favourable .",
    "the addition of chaotropic cosolvents to aqueous solutions therefore results in an increase in solvent - accessible surface area which destabilises hydrophobic aggregates , micelles and native protein structures  @xcite .",

    "[ seckosmo ] presents the results of monte carlo simulations for kosmotropic substances , which illustrate their stabilising effect on hydrophobic aggregation , the decrease in solubility of non - polar molecules in water - cosolvent mixtures and the underlying preferential exclusion of cosolvent molecules from the solvation shell of hydrophobic particles .",

    "[ secconclusion ] contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the driving force in the process of solvation and aggregation is the effective hydrophobic interaction between polar water and the non - polar solute  @xcite . as noted in sec .",
    "i , the origin of this interaction is the rearrangement of water around the solute particle . for solute surfaces of sufficiently high curvature to permit ( partial ) cage formation",
    ", this process decreases the enthalpy due to reinforced hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the solvation shell of the hydrophobic particle in comparison to those in bulk water , but reduces simultaneously the number of degenerate states of the solvent .",
    "these physical features are described by the model of muller , lee and graziano ( mlg ) , where the energy levels and respective degeneracies of water molecules are determined by the local water structure  @xcite .    because solute particles are relatively large compared with single water molecules , we use an adapted version of the mlg model in which each site contains a group of water molecules .",
    "the distinction between solvent molecules and non - polar solute particles lies in their ability to form hydrogen bonds .",
    "the continuous range of interaction energies within a partially hydrogen - bonded water cluster may be simplified to two discrete states of predominantly intact or broken hydrogen bonds  @xcite .",
    "the water sites in the coarse - grained model may then be characterised by two states , where an `` ordered '' site represents a water cluster with mostly intact hydrogen bonds , while a `` disordered '' site contains relatively fewer intact hydrogen bonds ( fig .",
    "[ figws ] ) .",
    "the use of a bimodal distribution in the adapted model is not an approximation , but a natural consequence of the two - state nature of the pure mlg model  @xcite . in the presence of a non - polar solute a further distinction",
    "is required , between `` bulk '' water sites undisturbed by the solute particles and `` shell '' sites in their vicinity whose hydrogen bonding is altered . as explained in more detail below , this adaptation of the mlg model contains the essential features required to encapsulate the enthalpy / entropy balance which is the basis for the primary phenomena of hydrophobic aggregation in two - component water / solute mixtures .",
    "the model has been used to reproduce the appearance of upper ( ucst ) and lower ( lcst ) critical solution temperatures and a closed - loop coexistence regime  @xcite , demonstrating that the origin of the hydrophobic interaction lies in the alteration of water structure .",
    "the adapted mlg model has been extended to provide a minimal model for the study of chaotropic phenomena in ternary water / solute / cosolvent systems  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this framework yields a successful description of preferential binding , and of the resulting destabilisation of aggregates of solute particles as a consequence of the role of chaotropic cosolvents in reducing the formation of water structure .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the model to summarise its physical basis and to explain the modifications required for the inclusion of cosolvent effects .",
    "the microscopic origin of the energy and degeneracy parameters for the four different types of water site ( ordered / disordered and shell / bulk ) is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in conjunction with experimental and theoretical justification for the considerations involved .",
    "here we provide only a qualitative explanation of their relative sizes , which ensure the competition of enthalpic and entropic contributions underlying the fact that the model describes a closed - loop aggregation region bounded by upper and lower critical temperatures and densities  @xcite .",
    "considering first the energies of water sites ( groups of molecules ) , the strongest hydrogen bonding arises not in ordered bulk water , but in the shell sites of hydrophobic particles due to the cage formation described in sec .",
    "i ( which can be considered as a result of the orientational effect of a hydrophobic surface )",
    ". both types of ordered water cluster are enthalpically much more favourable than disordered groups of molecules , for which the presence of a non - polar particle serves only to reduce hydrogen bonding still further , making the disordered shell energy the highest of all .",
    "as regards the site degeneracies , which account for the entropy of the system , cage formation permits very few different molecular configurations , and has a low degeneracy .",
    "water molecules in ordered clusters have significantly reduced rotational degrees of freedom compared to disordered ones , with the result that the degeneracy of the latter is considerably higher . finally , the degeneracy of a disordered shell site is still higher than that of a bulk site because the relative reduction of hydrogen bonding due to the non - polar surface admits a higher amount of rotational freedom .",
    "figure  [ figmlg ] summarises the energy levels of a water site , which are arranged in the sequence @xmath1 .",
    "their respective degeneracies are @xmath2 , where the states are denoted @xmath3 = disordered shell , @xmath4 = disordered bulk , @xmath5 = ordered bulk and @xmath6 = ordered shell ( cage conformation ) .",
    "we stress that these sequences are neither an assuption of the model nor may they be altered if the model is to represent a system exhibiting the closed - loop form of the coexistence curve for aggregation : only these specific sequences reproduce appropriately the competition of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy . from the microscopic considerations of the previous paragraph these sequences are entirely plausible , and",
    "they have been confirmed by a range of experimental measurements ; the exact values of the parameters are not important for the qualitative properties of the system while the order of energies and degeneracies is maintained .",
    "we return in sec .",
    "v to the issue of departure from these sequences .    in the calculations to follow",
    "we have used the energy values @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are thought to be suitably representative for aqueous solutions , and which have been successful in describing a number of different types of solution  @xcite .",
    "their corresponding degeneracies , normalised to a non - degenerate ordered shell conformation , are taken as @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that these energy and degeneracy parameters are independent of temperature and solute density .",
    "their relative values have been found to be appropriate for reproducing the primary qualitative features of hydrophobic interactions  @xcite , swelling of biopolymers  @xcite , protein denaturation  @xcite , and micelle formation  @xcite .",
    "the essential behaviour obtained within this model is indeed found to be rather insensitive to the precise parameter values , which may , however , be refined by comparison with experimental measurements to yield semi - quantitative agreement for different solutions  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale is correlated directly with a temperature scale , which we define as @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude this subsection by qualifying the range of validity of the adapted mlg model , including what is meant above by `` small '' solute particles .",
    "the model is not appropriate for solute species smaller than a group of water molecules with intercluster hydrogen - bonding , which necessitates a linear cluster ( and solute ) size of at least 2 water molecules .",
    "the model will also fail to capture the physics of large , uniform systems where the linear cluster size exceeds perhaps 10 water molecules , because in this case the majority of the water molecules in a `` shell site '' would correspond effectively to bulk water .",
    "most molecular - scale treatments of water structure in the vicinity of non - polar solute particles assume a spherical and atomically flat solute surface .",
    "these analyses @xcite indicate that `` clathrate '' models for the ( partial ) formation of hydrogen - bonded cages become inappropriate for larger curvatures , on the order of 1 nm , where a crossover occurs to `` depletion '' or `` dangling - bond '' models in which hydrogen - bond formation is frustrated @xcite . while the adapted mlg model becomes inapplicable for such particles at the point where a clathrate description breaks down , we note @xcite that most solute species , and in particular proteins , are atomically rough , in that they composed of chains and side - groups with high local curvatures on the order of 0.3 - 0.5 nm . as a consequence",
    "the model may remain valid for solute particles of considerably greater total dimension .",
    "for the purposes of the present analysis , we note that a significant quantity of the available data concerning cosolvent effects has been obtained for protein solutions , and that the majority of this data is consistent with our basic picture of the dominance of water structure effects in dictating solute solubility .",
    "however , while most proteins may indeed fall in the class of systems well described by a clathrate picture , we stress that the adapted mlg model can not be expected to provide a complete description for large solute molecules containing many amino - acids of different local hydrophobicity and chemical interactions .      in comparison with the hydrophobic solute particles ,",
    "cosolvent molecules are generally small and polar , and are therefore included directly in water sites by changing the number of states of these sites .",
    "a site containing water molecules and a cosolvent particle is referred to as a cosolvent site .",
    "kosmotropic cosolvents , being more polar than water , increase the number of intact hydrogen bonds at a site  @xcite . in the bimodal mlg framework",
    "their addition to weakly hydrogen - bonded , disordered clusters may be considered to create ordered clusters with additional intact hydrogen bonds .",
    "the creation of ordered states from disordered ones in the presence of a kosmotropic cosolvent increases the degeneracy of the former at the expense of the latter .",
    "this feature is incorporated by raising the number of possible ordered states compared to the number of disordered states ( solid arrows in fig .",

    "chaotropic cosolvents are less strongly polar than water , acting in an aqueous solution of hydrophobic particles to reduce the extent of hydrogen bonding between water molecules in both shell and bulk sites  @xcite . within the adapted mlg framework , this effect is reproduced by the creation of disordered states , with additional broken hydrogen bonds and higher enthalpy , from the more strongly bonded ordered clusters ( dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ figmlg ] ) , whence @xmath14    we stress three important qualitative points .",
    "first , the cosolvent affects only the number of intact hydrogen bonds , but not their strength @xcite , as a result of which , also in the bimodal distribution of the coarse - grained model , the energies of the states remain unchanged .",
    "cosolvent effects are reproduced only by the changes they cause in the relative numbers of each type of site [ eqs .",
    "( [ eqdegen ] ) and ( [ eqdegen2 ] ) ] .",
    "secondly , cosolvent effects on the relative degeneracy parameters are significantly stronger in the bulk than in the shell , because for obvious geometrical reasons related to the orientation of water molecules around a non - polar solute particle  @xcite , many more hydrogen - bonded configurations are possible in the bulk . finally , as suggested in sec .",
    "i , our general framework does not include the possibility of cosolvent - solute interactions , which have been found to be important in certain ternary systems , specifically those containing urea @xcite .    the illustrative calculations in secs .",

    "the microscopic origin of these preferential effects lies in the energetically favourable enhancement of hydrogen - bonded water structure in the presence of a kosmotropic cosolvent , and conversely the avoidance of its disruption in the presence of a chaotrope . in a more macroscopic interpretation ,",
    "the preferential hydration of solute particles by kosmotropic agents can be considered to strengthen the solvent - induced , effective hydrophobic interaction between solute particles , thus stabilising their aggregates ; similarly , the preferential binding of chaotropic agents to solute particles reduces the hydrophobic interaction , causing the particles to remain in solution .",
    "the essential cosolvent phenomena may thus be explained purely by the propensity of these agents to promote or suppress water structure formation , and the effectiveness of a cosolvent is contained in a transparent way in the microscopic degeneracy parameters of the solvent states .    our focus on water structure",
