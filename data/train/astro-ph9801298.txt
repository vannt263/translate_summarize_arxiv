    "stellar evolution calculations show that stars with a main sequence mass in the range 819 @xmath3 finish their lives with a compact core of @xmath4 ( woosley & weaver 1995 @xcite ) . for these stars",
    "the amount of material that falls back toward the core in the aftermath of its collapse is negligible , so it is likely that they give birth to neutron stars .",
    "the fate of stars with main sequence mass in the range 1925 @xmath3 is far less obvious . at the end of their evolution",
    ", they have core masses around 1.61.8 @xmath3 and a variable amount of matter , 0.10.3 @xmath3 may fall back .",
    "typically , these explosions leave a central compact remnant of 1.72.1 @xmath3 whose nature depends critically on the maximum ( gravitational ) mass of a neutron star , @xmath5 , and hence on the equation of state of dense nuclear matter . to date , the value of @xmath5 is quite uncertain : @xmath6 for a nonrotating star .",
    "the mass of the progenitor of sn1987a ( @xmath7 1821 @xmath3 ) falls in the range of masses where the outcome of core collapse is uncertain ; from a theoretical point of view , we do not know if a neutron star or a black hole formed during the explosion . however , if a compact object of any kind is present , it is probably accreting from the progenitor stellar material ( chevalier 1989@xcite ) . the bolometric light curve observed to date can be explained by the `` standard '' theory of type ii supernovae .",
    "it is therefore important to determine what extra luminosity an accreting central component would produce and when its presence might be discernible . in this paper we present results from the first fully relativistic investigation of supernova fallback in presence of a bh including the effects of hydrodynamics and radiation transport .",
    "we constructed a spherically symmetric , general ",
    "relativistic radiation hydrodynamic lagrangian code capable of handling the transfer of radiation from the early phase when photons diffuse through a high temperature , expanding cloud , to the late stage when the hydrogen envelope has recombined and most of the ejecta are transparent ( zampieri et al .",
    "( 1997)@xcite ) .",
    "we consider fallback from a hydrogen  cloud \" ; all of the emitted energy comes from the release of heat residing in the gas originally , or is generated by compressional heating in the course of accretion onto the bh .",
    "radioactive energy sources have not been included in our calculations . at the onset of evolution",
    "the cloud has homogenous density @xmath8 and a velocity profile which scales linearly with radius @xmath9 .",
    "the temperature profile is taken to be equal to the `` radiative zero solution '' given by arnett ( 1980)@xcite and the degree of ionization is computed throughout evolution according to the saha equation .",
    "four parameters uniquely specify the state of the `` cloud '' : the total mass @xmath10 , the radius @xmath11 , the sound speed at the inner boundary @xmath12 , and the ratio @xmath13 of the accretion timescale @xmath14 ( @xmath15 mass of the bh ) to the expansion time @xmath16 ( @xmath17 maximum expansion velocity of the ejecta ) .",
    "we find two phases of evolution . in the first stage ,",
    "gas expands adiabatically in the outer region and accretes close to the central hole . during this phase ,",
    "the cloud is radiation dominated .",
    "a second phase follows , during which hydrogen recombines and the `` cloud '' becomes optically thin .",
    "[ myfirstfigure ] shows the temperature profile of model a characterized by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 g @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 cm , @xmath22 and @xmath23 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "a recombination wave develops that propagates rapidly through the envelope .",
    "the recombination front stalls as soon as it approaches the innermost region where compressional heating due to accretion overcomes radiative cooling . outside the recombination front",
    "the flow is transparent but it remains optically thick inside for a long time .",
    "the density and velocity profiles display a self  similar character and are unaffected by the propagation of the recombination front .",
    "as recombination begins , the huge amount of internal energy released gives rise to a big bump in the light curve at @xmath24 days , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mysecondfigure ] . after the emission maximum",
    ", the luminosity falls off abruptly . during the late evolution ,",
    "the light curve is entirely powered by accretion onto the central bh and the luminosity decreases as a power law with time . at late times",
    ", the evolution proceeds through a sequence of quasistationary states , and @xmath25 ( in eddington units ) can be estimated using the scaling relation for a pressureless fluid ( colpi et al . 1996@xcite ; equation [ 29 ] ) @xmath26 \\rho_0 \\,t_0 k_{es } c \\left ( { t / t_0 } \\right ) ^{-5/3 } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the luminosity @xmath28 ( in eddington units ) is close to that derived by blondin ( 1986)@xcite for stationary accretion @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ mysecondfigure ] , the dotted line at the bottom denotes the late  time accretion luminosity estimated using equations ( [ dustmdot ] ) and ( [ lumblon ] ) : the analytic extrapolation is in good agreement with the computed light curve .",
    "slightly after maximum , sn1987a was powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath30co and @xmath31co , and at present its light curve is consistent with emission from the decay of @xmath32ti ( suntzeff 1997@xcite ; fig .",
    "[ mysecondfigure ] ) .",
    "can we discern the luminosity emitted by the accreting bh above the contribution resulting from @xmath32ti ?",
    "an upper limit to the accretion luminosity of sn1987a can be inferred from equations ( [ dustmdot ] ) and ( [ lumblon ] ) ( for details see zampieri et al .",
    "( 1997)@xcite ) .",
    "following chevalier ( 1989)@xcite , we adopt @xmath33 cgs and @xmath34 seconds , yielding a luminosity @xmath35^{25/18 } }   \\ , .\\ ] ] equation ( [ lumfall ] ) implies @xmath36 after @xmath37 years , which is well below the present day bolometric luminosity of the remnant ( @xmath2 ; suntzeff 1997@xcite ) and also smaller than the luminosity estimated to result from radioactive decay .",
    "thus , there is no observation that rules out the possibility that a bh resides inside the sn1987a remnant . in fig .",
    "[ mysecondfigure ] we plot the late  time light curve of sn1987a calculated using ( [ lumfall ] ) .",
    "as radioactive decay plummets at around 2702700 years , it is clear that the bh would only appear after about 900 years irrespective of the detailed numbers .",
    "after this time has elapsed , the luminosity of the remnant would be @xmath38 , too dim for detection with present technology",
    ". the inner part of the accretion flow will be still optically thick and will be emitting roughly a black body spectrum peaked in the visible band ."
