    "it was the genius of baade @xmath3 zwicky @xcite who were able to deduce the total energy released in a supernova explosion to be of the order of ( @xmath4 ) erg on the basis of a few points of the light curve without any spectral information available at that time .",
    "later colgate @xmath3 white @xcite and arnett @xcite presented their classical work on energy transport by neutrinos and antineutrinos in non - rotating massive stars .",
    "since then we have come a long way and despite the immense technological advancements the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae continues to pose challenges for the collapse simulators throughout the globe . the prompt shock that follows the bounce stagnates and is incapable of producing a supernova explosion on its own .",
    "the stagnation is due to energy losses in disintegration of iron nuclei ( so far cooked in the stellar pot ) and through neutrino emissions ( mainly non - thermal ) .",
    "the stellar matter is till then transparent to the neutrinos emitted",
    ". a few milliseconds after the bounce , the proto - neutron star accretes mass at a few tenths of solar mass per second .",
    "this accretion , if continued even for one second , can change the ultimate fate of the collapsing core resulting into a black hole .",
    "neutrinos have a crucial role to play in this scenario and radiate around 10@xmath5 of the rest mass converting the star to a neutron star .",
    "initially the nascent neutron star is a hot thermal bath of dense nuclear matter , @xmath6 pairs , photons and neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos , having the weak - interaction , are most effective in cooling and diffuse outward within a few seconds , and eventually escape with about 99@xmath5 of the released gravitational energy . despite the small neutrino - nucleus cross sections , the neutrinos flux generated by the cooling of a neutron star can produce a number of nuclear transmutations as it passes the onion - like structured envelope surrounding the neutron star .",
    "the microphysics involved in these extreme processes is indeed complex and one should be very cautious in interpolating and/or extrapolating values of stellar parameters during various phases of stellar evolution . a lot",
    "many physical inputs are required at the beginning of each stage of the entire simulation process ( e.g. collapse of the core , formation , stalling and revival of the shock wave and shock propagation ) .",
    "it is highly desirable to calculate these parameters with the most reliable physical data and inputs .    during the late phases of evolution of massive stars an iron core develops ( of mass around @xmath7 ) .",
    "capture rates and photodisintegration processes contribute in lowering of the degeneracy pressure required to counter the enormous self - gravity force of the star . under such extreme thermodynamic conditions ,",
    "neutrinos are produced in abundance .",
    "eventually the collapse of the iron core begins .",
    "the mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is strongly believed to depend upon the transfer of energy from the inner core to the outer mantle of the iron core .",
    "neutrinos seem to be the mediators of this energy transfer . as mentioned above the shock wave , produced as a result , stalls due to photodisintegration and neutrino energy losses .",
    "once again the part played by neutrinos in this scenario is far from being completely understood . in the late - time neutrino heating mechanism",
    "the stalled shock can be revived ( about 1 s after the bounce ) and may be driven as a delayed explosion @xcite .",
    "however to date there have been no successfully simulated spherically symmetric explosions .",
    "even the 2d simulations ( addition of convection ) performed with a boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport fails to convert the collapse into an explosion @xcite .",
    "( recently a few simulation groups ( e.g. @xcite have reported successful explosions in 2d mode . ) additional energy sources ( e.g. magnetic fields and rotations ) were also sought that might transport energy to the mantle and lead to an explosion .",
    "world - wide core - collapse simulators are still working hard to come up with a convincing and decisive mode of producing explosions .",
    "neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae are unique messengers of the microphysics of supernovae and are crucial to the life and afterlife of supernovae .",
    "they provide information regarding the neutronization due to electron capture , the infall phase , the formation and propagation of the shock wave and the cooling phase .",
    "cooling rate is one of the crucial parameters that strongly affects the stellar evolution . in stellar matter",
    "the neutrinos are produced from both weak - interaction reactions and pure leptonic processes .",
    "the later includes pair annihilation , bremsstrahlung on nuclei , plasmon decay and @xmath8-photoproduction processes .",
    "white dwarfs and supernovae ( which are the endpoints for stars of varying masses ) have both cooling rates largely dominated by neutrino production .",
    "a cooling proto - neutron star emits about @xmath9 erg in neutrinos , with the energy roughly equipartitioned among all species .",
    "the neutrino energy loss rates are important input parameters in multi - dimensional simulations of the contracting proto - neutron star .",
    "parameter - free multi - dimensional models , with neutrino transport included consistently throughout the entire mass , yield conflicting results on the key issue of whether the star actually explodes .",
    "reliable and microscopic calculations of neutrino loss rates and capture rates can contribute effectively in the final outcome of these simulations . whereas neutrinos produced via pure leptonic processes dominate in the very high temperature - density domain during the very late phases of stellar evolution",
    ", the weak - interaction neutrinos also play an important role in cooling the core to a lower entropy specially during the early phases of stellar evolution .",
    "this work is primarily devoted to calculate the neutrino energy loss rates due to weak - interaction reactions ( capture and @xmath10 decays ) on @xmath2ni .",
    "@xmath2ni is abundant in the presupernova conditions and weak - interaction reactions on this nucleus is believed to contribute effectively in the dynamics of presupernova evolution .",
    "aufderheide and collaborators @xcite ranked @xmath2ni as the third most important electron capture nucleus averaged throughout the stellar trajectory for 0.4 @xmath11 0.5 during the presupernova evolution .",

    "consequently electron capture rates on @xmath2ni is an important process during these phases . during later stages after the bounce and shock propagation ( t @xmath14 0.12s ) the photodisintegration of iron - group nuclei to alpha particles and protons results which marks the beginning of the proto - neutron star .    in this paper",
    "i analyze the weak - interaction neutrino energy loss rates ( which i term as neutrino cooling rates throughout this text ) due to this key isotope of nickel which is so abundant during the silicon burning phases of the stellar core . due to the extreme conditions prevailing in these scenarios , interpolation of calculated rates within large intervals of temperature - density points",

    "the calculation of neutrino cooling rates was also compared with previous calculations . for the sake of comparison i took into consideration the pioneer calculations of ffn @xcite and those performed using the large - scale shell model ( lssm ) @xcite .",
    "the ffn rates were used in many simulation codes ( e.g. kepler stellar evolution code @xcite ) while lssm rates were employed in recent simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11 - 40 @xmath80 @xcite .",
