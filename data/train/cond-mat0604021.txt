    "we study the lyotropic processes , which are widely distributed in biological systems and define the self - organization phenomena . in lyotropic liquid crystals , the numerous examples ( or even , in its clear majority ) , when topological genus of mesophase surfaces was changed at the phase transitions , are known .",
    "as kiselev observed in small - angle neutron scattering investigations @xcite , self - assembled vesiculation occurs between rod - like micelles and unilamellar vesicles with closed surfaces .",
    "self - assembled vesiculation is induced by temperature jump of 100 @xmath0 from room temperature and increases as function of detergent concentration .",
    "the typical bilayer - vesicle shape dimyristoyl - sn - glycero - phoshatidylcholine / water ( @xmath1 ) was observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the different types of mesomorphism are distinguished by the nonionic surfactant influence in dimyristoyl - sn - glycero - phoshatidylcholine / octaethyllene - glycol n - dodecyl ether / water ( @xmath2 ) and the drastic temperature jump .    in principle , certain closed stationary shapes ( pears , prolates , oblates , stomatocytes and nonaxisymmetric shapes with the symmetry @xmath3 ) are possible @xcite",
    ". theoretical models , which combine phenomenological and microcanonical methods were developed to interpret the spontaneous vesiculation phenomena in mesomorphism . based on helfrich theory , a spontaneous curvature @xmath4 ( shape independent @xmath4 with discontinuous budding transition ) model and area difference model ( shape independent @xmath5 with continuous one ) . the area - difference elasticity ( ade ) model @xcite describes the energy as a sum of two terms : one depends on curvature at any point on the surface , and second depends on curvature - induced area difference between the inner and outer monolayers . in the bilayer - couple model by svetina et al .",
    "@xcite , the bilayer structure is modelled by representing its two monolayers as closed neutral surfaces with a constant separation distance .",
    "the elastic energy is composed of the local and nonlocal bending energies of the membrane .",
    "at a spasmodic rise in temperature , a rod - like micelle becomes unstable and transforms into a bilayer , which then collapses into a hollow sphere .",
    "disintegration of the rod - like micelles and the bilayer were not experimentally observed @xcite , presumably , due to a fast jump .",
    "all of these phenomena look like a first order phase transitions , and there are situation when the symmetries of both phases are not in some ratio .    the typical budding process has been phenomenologically described @xcite and the shape equation for the axisymmetric equilibrium shape was obtained from some general variational ansatz . in a pure @xmath6 solution ,",
    "generative only the lamellar phase , it is found the lateral compression modulus and bilayer bending rigidity .",
    "however , at addition of nonionic surfactant @xmath7 , it becomes difficult to analytically predict the same parameters of the new mesomorphic series .",
    "using the ade model @xcite it is possible to determine the minimum energy shape of the vesicle as a function of the reduced volume @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the enclosed volume and @xmath10 is the initial volume . the reduced volume @xmath11 is concerned with the measured hydrodynamical radius of a vesicle by certain relations @xcite .",
    "to define the vesicle structure parameters , methods that combine the helfrich spontaneous curvature theory @xcite and the bilayer coupling model were developed .    in terms of a microscopic canonical ensemble and lattice ising - like models ,",
    "the main mesophases structure parameters may be connected by a spontaneous curvature , which is constructed on dual lattices @xcite by self - avoiding random surfaces .",
    "one would think so , that in frame of any spin variables , the mixture content is disregarding .",
    "as noted by caselle @xcite , a gas of self - avoiding random surfaces ( sars ) with unconstrained topology and is weighted by the usual area term @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a surface area and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath16 is the absolute temperature ) , belongs to the same class of the ising model . as other kinds of coupling",
    "are introduced , it is possible to generate these surfaces on the body centered cubic ( @xmath17 ) lattice and the dual lattice , like the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian of the ising model has the form @xmath18 with the partition function @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the coefficients of couplings , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are three kinds of coupling , and @xmath26=-1,0,1 are the spin components , which correspond to the different types of mixture molecules ( lipid , surfactant and water respectively ) , @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling coefficients are normalized by action @xmath13 in terms of the riemannian curvature @xmath28 @xcite , which is in accordance to the gauss - bonnet theorem @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the curvature components for four site spin configurations on the @xmath17 lattice .",
    "the concentration term @xmath22 in this model is in respect to by the chemical potential @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this treatment allow the numerical estimations to be conducted with the lattice monte carlo technique for the free energy and structural characteristics of the vesicular phases .    according to these calculations , all of transitions with qualitative surface changing genus , at @xmath22 range between 0.4 and 0.8",
    ", may correspond to the appropriate transitions , found in @xcite ( fig . 1 . ) .",

    "this model conveniently calculates the including volume and other main structure parameters to plot the phase diagrams of lyotropic mixtures .",
    "the ade model satisfactorily describes the vesicle phase transformations , where the non - homogeneous local properties can be expressed by the elasticity modulus and its fraction in a macroscopic scale .",
    "however , the presented model is well suited for studying numerous biophysical phenomena and complements the existing conceptions .",
    "in addition to phenomenological ade calculations , the lattice treatment of the lyotropic phase behavior of the aggregates is essential for directly controlling the concentration , which is a determinative parameter in the lyomesomorphic transformations .",
    "computer cluster simulation analysis is useful to investigate the local curvature properties of different aggregates , including vesicles .",
