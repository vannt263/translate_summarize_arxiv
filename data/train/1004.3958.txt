    "<S> an analytic parametrization of the hyperonic matter equation of state based on microscopic brueckner  hartree  </S>",
    "<S> fock calculations has been constructed using the realistic argonne v18 nucleon - nucleon potential plus a three - body force of urbana type , and three models of the hyperon - nucleon interaction : the nijmegen soft - core models nsc89 and nsc97e , and the most recent meson - exchange potential of the jlich group . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of this parametrization is based on a simple phase - space analysis and reproduces with good accuracy the results of the microscopic calculations with a small number of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this parametrization allows for rapid calculations that accurately mimic the microscopic results , being therefore , very useful from a practical point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> neutron stars offer an interesting interplay between nuclear processes and astrophysical observables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> properties of neutron stars , such as the mass range , the mass - radius relationship , the moment of inertia , the crust thickness or the cooling rate , are closely related to the underlying nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) for a wide range of densities and temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , its determination is an essential ingredient for understanding such properties .    at densities near the saturation density of nuclear matter , neutron star matter is thought to be mainly composed of neutrons , protons and leptons ( electrons and muons ) in @xmath0-equilibrium . as density increases </S>",
    "<S> , new hadronic degrees of freedom may appear in addition to nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> hyperons , baryons with a strangeness content , are an example of these degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to terrestial conditions , where hyperons are unstable and decay into nucleons through the weak interaction , the equilibrium conditions in neutron stars can make the inverse process , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ the conversion of nucleons into hyperons , happen , so the formation of hyperons becomes energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> although hyperonic matter is an idealized physical system , the theoretical determination of the corresponding eos is an essential step towards the understanding of properties of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the comparison of theoretical predictions for the properties of these objects with the observations can provide strong constraints on the interactions among their constituents . since the pionneering work of ambartsumyan and saakyan @xcite the eos of hyperonic matter has been considered by several authors either from phenomenological @xcite or microscopic @xcite approaches .    in phenomenological approaches </S>",
    "<S> the input is a density - dependent interaction which contains a certain number of parameters adjusted to reproduce experimental data . within this approach balberg and gal </S>",
    "<S> @xcite derived an analytic effective eos using density - dependent baryon - baryon potentials based on skyrme - type forces including hyperonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the features of this eos rely on the properties of nuclei for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , and mainly on the experimental data from hypernuclei for the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this eos reproduces characteristic properties of high - density matter found in theoretical microscopic models . within the same scheme , </S>",
    "<S> several authors @xcite have developed skyrme - like yn potentials to study properties of single- and multi-@xmath1 hypernuclei with the skyrme  </S>",
    "<S> hartree  </S>",
    "<S> fock formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative phenomenological approach involves the formulation of an effective relativistic mean field theory ( rmft ) of interacting hadrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fully relativistic approach treats the baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom explicitely , and is , in general , easier to handle because it only involves local densities and fields . </S>",
    "<S> the eos of dense matter with hyperons was first described within the rmft by glendenning @xcite and latter by other authors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters in this approach are fixed by the properties of nuclei and nuclear bulk matter for the nucleonic sector , whereas the coupling constants of the hyperons are fixed by symmetry relations , hypernuclear observables and compact star properties .    in microscopic approaches , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the input are two - body baryon - baryon interactions that describe the scattering observables in free space . </S>",
    "<S> these realistic interactions have been mainly constructed within the framework of a meson - exchange theory , although recently a new approach based on chiral perturbation theory has emerged as a powerful tool . in order to obtain the eos one has to solve the complicated nuclear many - body problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a great difficulty of this problem lies in the treatment of the repulsive core , which dominates the short - range behavior of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> various methods have been considered to solve the nuclear many - body problem : the variational approach @xcite , the correlated basis function ( cbf ) formalism @xcite , the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) technique @xcite , or the brueckner  bethe  goldstone ( bbg ) @xcite and the dirac  brueckner  </S>",
    "<S> hartree - fock ( dbhf ) theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , although all of them have been extensively applied to the study of nuclear matter , up to our knowledge , only the bbg theory @xcite , and very recently the dbhf one @xcite , and the @xmath2 approach @xcite , have been extended to the hyperonic sector .    </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic approach is in general technically complex and very time consuming . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from a practical point of view , it would be interesting to have an analytic parametrization of the hyperonic matter eos based on such approach that allow to mimic the microscopic results in a fast way with a small number of parameters . in the present work we will build a density functional for the eos based on microscopic brueckner  </S>",
    "<S> hartree  fock ( bhf ) calculations of hyperonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the nucleonic degress of freedom we will consider only @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons in the construction of our functional , the reason being that these two types of hyperons are the ones appearing first in calculations of @xmath0-stable neutron star matter based on microscopic approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other hyperons , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , being heavier , either do not appear or only show up at very large densities in microscopic calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> after a brief review of the bhf approach to the eos , we will detail the construction of the functional . </S>",
    "<S> we will finish by testing and discussing the quality and validity of our parametrization .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the bhf approximation of the bbg theory extended to the hyperonic matter case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our - many body scheme starts by constructing all the baryon - baryon @xmath8 matrices , which describe in an effective way the interaction between two baryons in the presence of a surrounding medium . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 matrices can be obtained by solving the bethe  goldstone equation , written schematically as @xmath9 where the first ( last ) two subindices indicate the initial ( final ) two - baryon states compatible with a given value @xmath10 of the strangeness , namely nn for @xmath11 and yn for @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the bare baryon - baryon interaction ( nn or yn ) ; @xmath14 is the pauli operator , that prevents the intermediate baryons @xmath15 and @xmath16 from being scattered to states below their respective fermi momenta ; and the starting energy @xmath17 corresponds to the sum of the nonrelativistic single - particle energies of the interacting baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that , although we have considered only @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons in the construction of our parametrization of the eos , @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperons have been also taken into account in the intermediate yn states when solving the bethe  </S>",
    "<S> goldstone equation . </S>",
    "<S> the interested reader is referred to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for computational details .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energy of a baryon @xmath15 is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 denotes the rest mass of the baryon , and the single - particle potential @xmath20 represents the averaged field `` felt '' by the baryon owing to its interaction with the other baryons of the medium . in the bhf approximation , @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where a sum over all the different partial contributions , @xmath22 , is performed , @xmath23 is the occupation number of the species @xmath16 , and the matrix elements are properly antisymmetrized when baryons @xmath15 and @xmath16 belong to the same isomultiplet . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that the so - called continuous prescription has been adopted for the single - particle potentials when solving the bethe  </S>",
    "<S> goldstone equation , since , as shown by the authors of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the contribution to the energy per particle from three - body clusters is minimized in this prescription .    </S>",
    "<S> all the calculations carried out in this work have been performed with the realistic argonne v18 @xcite nn interaction supplemented with a nnn three - body force ( tbf ) of urbana type which , for use in bhf calculations , was reduced to a two - body density - dependent force by averaging over the third nucleon in the medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this tbf contains two parameters that are fixed by requiring that the bhf calculation reproduces the energy and saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the interested reader is referred to the works of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a recent analysis of the use of tbf s in nuclear and neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> the yn @xmath8-matrices have been constructed using three yn models : the nijmegen soft - core models nsc89 @xcite and nsc97e @xcite , and the most recent yn meson - exchange potential of the jlich group @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will use the names jlich , nsc89 and nsc97 models to denote the three different nn+nnn+yn models under consideration , since the pure nucleonic part is the same in all of them . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the yy interaction has not been considered in the present work due to the large uncertainties still existing in this sector .    </S>",
    "<S> once a self - consistent solution of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bge ] ) and ( [ eq : spp ] ) is obtained , the total energy per particle is easily calculated : @xmath24 \\equiv \\frac{t}{a}+\\frac{v}{a } \\ . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , from a practical point of view , it would be interesting and useful to characterize the dependence of the total energy per particle @xmath31 on the particle densities @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , or , alternatively on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in a simple analytical form . </S>",

    "<S> the single - particle potentials of the four baryon species under consideration can be written as @xmath42 for small values of the hyperon fraction , the isospin asymmetry , and the asymmetry between @xmath1 s and @xmath3 s , one can neglect the dependence on @xmath43 and @xmath33 of the average @xmath8 matrices assuming @xmath44 , and @xmath45 note that the quantities @xmath46 receive contributions from different isospin ( @xmath47 ) and strangeness ( @xmath10 ) channels . whereas @xmath48 receives contributions only from the isospin triplet and zero strangeness channel </S>",
