    "the relevant energy and wavefunction components are @xmath52 @xmath53 the results for @xmath42 agree with those obtained from the truncation of the confluent heun functions @xcite , within a harmless renormalisation of the wavefunction components .    as a further check ,",

    "the explicit wavefunction components for @xmath54 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 where @xmath63      some comments can be made about the degenerate atomic limit @xmath64 for general @xmath30 .",
    "the degenerate solutions @xmath65 , for @xmath25 satisfy the algebraic equations ( [ alg1 ] ) , with @xmath46 following from the constraint relation ( [ con1 ] ) .",
    "the energy is given by ( [ energy+ ] ) with ( [ fac ] ) giving the wavefunction component @xmath66 this is precisely the solution obtained for the equivalent displaced harmonic oscillator in the bargmann space @xcite .",

    "the constraint polynomials for given @xmath30 are generated readily enough via the recurrence relation .",
    "a similar recurrence relation can be written down corresponding to the solutions @xmath31 .",
    "this results in the same constraint polynomials as given in the above examples , however with @xmath85 .",
    "in contrast the approach used here gives the closed form expressions ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) , albeit in terms of the roots of the algebraic equations ( [ alg1 ] ) and ( [ alg2 ] ) .",
