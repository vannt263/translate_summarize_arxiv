    "the gelation transition transforms a viscous liquid ( sol ) into an elastic disordered solid ( gel ) . in general this process is due to the formation of a macroscopic molecule , due to the bonding of multifunctional monomers in solution , which makes the system able to bear stress .",
    "the extent of the gelation process may be measured by the monomer volume fraction @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of monomers , @xmath3 is the single monomer volume and @xmath4 is the total system volume . on the static point of view",

    "complex dynamical behaviours are observed in gelling systems already in the sol phase .",
    "for example , light scattering measurements show non - exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function , @xmath5 , in both permanent @xcite and thermoreversible physical gels @xcite . in particular power laws",
    "are observed at intermediate times , followed , at long times , by stretched exponential decays , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . in the gel phase , where ergodicity is broken ,",
    "only the power law decay survives .",
    "usually the onset of stretched exponential decays ( present also in other complex systems , as spin glasses and glassy systems ) is associated to the widening of relaxation times , which in gelling systems is due to the presence of a broad cluster size distribution close to the gelation threshold .",
    "however general predictions which connect this kind of relaxation to percolation theory are not easily feasible .    in this paper , assuming `` simple '' behaviours for the relaxation of clusters with given size , we show how the `` complex '' phenomenology of the relaxation in permanent gels may be obtained from the superposition of the behaviours of clusters with different sizes .",
    "in particular we are able to predict the behaviours of the self intermediate scattering function , of the dynamical susceptibility , of the van - hove function , and of the non - gaussian parameter , and to connect these behaviours to the cluster size distribution and the critical exponents of percolation .",
