    "in the late stage of the dark ages of the universe , neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) began to be reionized by uv and soft x - ray photons ( baek et al .",
    "2010 ) emitted by the first - generation sources , such as stars and/or quasars ( see morales & wyithe 2010 for a recent review ) .",
    "this period , which started sometime from about 150 myrs to 500 myrs since the big bang , is known as the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , and is one of a few most important milestones in the evolution histories of both our universe and galaxies .",
    "the study of the line emission of neutral hydrogen at 21 cm ( 21 cm signals hereafter ) coming from the surroundings of ionizing sources in eor provides us with a novel opportunity to reveal the properties of the first - generation stars and/or quasars , as well as to constrain cosmological models ( e.g. , iliev et al .",
    "2002 ; furlanetto et al .",
    "2004a ; santos & cooray 2006 ; morales & wyithe 2010 ) .",
    "eor is expected to be a major center of interest within the next one or two decades for the facilities working in the low - frequency radio band ( @xmath5 ghz ) , such as the 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ) , the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the murchison wide - field array ( mwa ) , and the square kilometer array ( ska ) .",
    "one of the serious challenges in observing the 21 cm signals from eor is that they are extremely weak ( @xmath6 mk ) .",
    "having been redshifted to the low - frequency radio band ( @xmath7 mhz , for @xmath8 ; morales & wyithe 2010 ; field 1959a , 1959b ; scott & rees 1990 ; madau et al .",
    "1997 ) , the 21 cm signals are drowned in the luminous foreground , which consists of our galaxy , extragalactic discrete sources ( e.g. , radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei , i.e. , agns ) , galaxy clusters , and other relatively minor contaminating sources .",
    "theoretical and numerical efforts have been made in the past few years to probe how to correctly restore the redshifted 21 cm signals from this overwhelmingly luminous foreground , e.g. , extraction of the 21 cm signals in either the angular power spectrum space ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; santos et al . 2005 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ) , or the frequency space ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2006 ; gleser et al . 2008 ; jeli et al . 2008 ; bowman et al . 2009 ; harker et al .",
    "2009a ; liu et al .",
    "2009 ; petrovic & oh 2011 ) , both on the _ a priori _ assumption that the integral foreground emission can be well described as a smooth continuum .    for the separation works in the frequency space , the total spectrum",
    "is usually fitted with a smooth function ( e.g. , an n - order polynomial model @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) to describe the integral foreground brightness temperature @xmath11 .",
    "however , the first thing one shall keep in mind is that the foreground models adopted by previous works are relatively simple more or less , e.g. , extragalactic discrete sources are treated as point sources , showing no substructure such as lobes and jets that are often observed in nearby fri and frii radio galaxies , and/or possessing simple , featureless power - law radio spectra .",
    "meanwhile , galaxy clusters , which contribute to the foreground at a non - negligible level compared with agns , are not taken into account , or treated as simple power - law spectrum sources . a revisit to the separation approach with more complex and more realistic foreground models",
    "is necessary .",
    "secondly , a variety of theoretical and numerical works ( e.g. , furlanetto et al .",
    "2004b ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ; furlanetto & oh 2005 ; petrovic & oh 2011 ) have already indicated that in late phases of the cosmic reionization , the typical sizes of ionized regions are of the order of a few tens of comoving mpc , so that the 21 cm signals possess slowly - varying components at @xmath12 mhz scales in frequency space due to a specific distribution of hii bubble sizes .",
    "for example , mesinger & furlanetto ( 2007 ) predicted that at @xmath2 the diameter distribution of the hii bubbles is peaked at @xmath13 mpc ( corresponding to a frequency span of @xmath14 mhz ) , along with a significant tail out to @xmath15 mpc ( @xmath16 mhz ) .",
    "apparently , the non - negligible slowly - varying 21 cm components contributed by these giant bubbles should have been entangled with the foreground in frequency space , and most of them are bound to be abandoned in foreground subtraction , especially when a single - narrow - frequency segment ( e.g. , @xmath17 mhz as used in wang et al .",
    "2006 ) is adopted in the quadratic polynomial fittings .",
    "in fact , there is a significant power loss on mpc scales as will be shown in  3.2.1 .    in order to address the problems raised above",
    ", we attempt to re - examine and improve the polynomial fitting algorithm by applying a more complex foreground emission model that contains detailed emulations of both spatial and spectral features of the real sources ( see wang et al .",

    "( 2008 ) , and references therein ; w2010 hereafter ) , meanwhile employing a multi - narrow - frequency segment quadratic polynomial fitting technique to remove the foreground emission components in frequency space .",
    "we find that our new algorithm can reasonably correct the systematic bias introduced by the single - narrow - segment algorithm , which may lead to a reduction of the 21 cm signal power by about 75% for @xmath3 mpc scales and 34% for @xmath4 mpc scales , and therefore a significant underestimate of both the hii bubble size and growth rate .",
    "we also prove that at @xmath18 our algorithm is efficient and reliable in restoring mass distribution on @xmath19 mpc scales ( by contrast about @xmath20 power will be lost with the single - segment approach ) , thus it can be applied to extract the 21 cm signals emitted at intermediate redshifts to investigate the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , which exhibit a typical scale of @xmath21 comoving mpc ( morales & wyithe 2010 ; ansari et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in parallel to the polynomial fitting technique ,",
    "recently a series of works have been published in an attempt to develop non - parametric techniques and apply them in observing the 21 cm signals , which do not assume a specific form for the contaminating foregrounds .",
    "using wp smoothing method , harker et al .",

    "more detailed discussion on the non - parametric techniques can be found in the works listed above , and will not be presented here because it is beyond the scope of this paper .    throughout the work we adopt @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . unless otherwise stated ,",

    "we are allowed to convert the derived @xmath40 into the one - dimensional ( 1d ) power spectrum using the integration formula @xmath43 ( peacock 1999 ) .",
    "the 1d power spectra are shown in figure 1 for some typical redshifts .",

    "we adopt a segment width of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , therefore the frequency resolution ( i.e. , the width of each frequency channel ) is @xmath58 , which is a sufficiently high frequency resolution in order to reconstruct the local power spectrum for the give @xmath41 at @xmath26 .",
    "the foreground emission components that contaminate the 21 cm signals have been continuously discussed and simulated in detail in many works ( e.g. , jeli et al .",

    "all the simulated sky maps are plotted in a circular field of view ( fov ) with a radius of @xmath59 centered at the north celestial pole , as currently being observed with the 21cma array , and the obtained images are pixelated with grids of @xmath60 pixels , each image pixel covering approximately a @xmath61 patch .",

    "the brightness temperatures of the simulated foreground at 150 mhz are listed in table 1 .",
    "the 21cma array is a low - frequency radio interferometer array constructed in a remote area of xinjiang , china .",
    "the array consists of 81 telescopes that are distributed in a `` t '' shape with the north - south and east - west baselines being 6 km and 4 km , respectively ( figure 2 ) , and each telescope is an assembly of 127 logarithmic periodic antennas .",
    "the 21cma array is designed to continuously observe the same patch of the sky around ncp ( i.e. , 24 hrs a day ) .",
    "the integration uv coverage of 24 hrs is shown in figure 3 .",

    "to extract the foreground components , n - order polynomial models are usually applied in the frequency space , e.g. , wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed a logarithmic form @xmath84 to approximate the integral foreground in a single segment with a width of @xmath85 mhz for @xmath86 , where @xmath87 are the parameters all obtained by applying the least squares fitting method . to determine if this approximation is appropriate when complex foreground is introduced , and if it can be applied to a wider frequency segment of a width @xmath6 mhz as will be discussed in  3.2 and  4.1 , we fit the pure simulated integral foreground in the logarithmic frequency space using linear polynomial ( @xmath88 ) , quadratic polynomial ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) , and cubic polynomial ( @xmath89 ) , respectively .",
    "each of the three polynomial fittings is applied to 1000 randomly selected sky pixels on the simulated foreground map with different segment widths ( i.e. , @xmath90 mhz for @xmath86 , where @xmath91 ) with central frequency located at @xmath92 . as shown in figure 4",
    ", the intensity residuals of linear polynomial fittings can reach up to @xmath6 mk in many cases , which is comparable with the intensity of the 21 cm signals , whereas the residuals of quadratic polynomial fittings ( @xmath5 mk ) are small enough to be negligible compared to the intensities of both the instrumental noises and the 21 cm signals . since the quadratic polynomial fitting is good enough to approximate the complex foreground for a large range of @xmath93",
    ", we decide that the cubic one with even smaller residuals is unnecessary in our work .    in figure 4",
    ", it is also shown that the residuals , although statistically small enough to make the quadratic polynomial fittings acceptable when @xmath94 mhz , increase as the segment broadens . we ascribe this to the fact that our foreground model ( for details see  2.2.1 and w2010 )",
    "is complex , thus a broader segment means that more complicated behaviors of the foreground have been involved to cause larger uncertainties .",
    "we note that the clustering of the extragalactic discrete sources and galaxy clusters , which has been taken into account in our sky simulation , does not lead to significant residuals to overwhelm the 21 cm signals in the separation process .",

    "2006 ) might not be achieved until the next generation facilities have been built . for currently operating facilities , such as 21cma and lofar",
    ", the noise will dominate the 21 cm signals from the eor , so that direct restoration of the 21 cm signals is precluded ( e.g. , mcquinn et al .",

    "2009b ; chapman et al .",
    "2012 ) . to study this case , here",
    "we assume a noise level of @xmath95 mk , which is achievable with a one - year observation of 21cma (  2.2.2 ) , and investigate how to restore the 21 cm signals .",
    "as a first step , we apply the separation approach on a single segment with a narrow width of @xmath96 mhz ( the channel width @xmath97 khz ) , to examine if the information on the fluctuations of the 21 cm signals on mpc scales is lost when our complex foreground model is applied .",
    "the segment width of @xmath98 mhz is adopted to guarantee that the power spectrum of the 21 cm signals is roughly uniform within the corresponding redshift segment ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 can be measured accurately .",
    "we fit the total ( foreground + noise + 21 cm signals ) brightness - temperature spectrum @xmath101 with equation ( 6 ) to determine the best - fit foreground @xmath102 , and derive the residuals ( raw spectrum hereafter ) @xmath103 , which contain the 21 cm signals and a dominating noise component ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) .",
    "then , we transform the raw spectrum into the corresponding power spectrum .",
    "by subtracting the theoretically predicted noise component from the averaged power spectrum for a sufficiently large number of sky pixels , we may obtain a mean restored power spectrum for the 21 cm signals ( e.g. , harker et al .",
    "2010 ; chapman et al .",
    "2012 ) . when comparing the results with the input 1d power spectra created in the simulations (  2.1 ; fig .",
    "1 ) , we find that , when 10000 sky pixels ( 12 arcmin@xmath62 for each ) that cover about 1/3 fov of the 21cma ( about 33 deg@xmath62 ) are in use , the power spectrum of the 21 cm signals can be well recovered on small scales of @xmath105 , whereas on larger scales the deviation is huge ( reduced @xmath106 ; figure 5a ) .",
    "we measure the relative mpc - scale power restoration in terms of the ratio of restored to simulated powers as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the mpc - scale power of the input 21 cm signals .",
    "we find that the mean value is @xmath109 for the total 10000 cases , which indicates that the use of single - narrow - segment quadratic polynomial fitting technique may cause an average power loss on mpc scales ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) of about @xmath111 in the redshifted 21 cm signals .",
    "since the existence of such mpc - scale structures is expected to be quite common in late phases of eor ( e.g. , furlanetto et al . 2004b",
    "; petrovic & oh 2011 ) , part of the 21 cm signals is bound to be abandoned along with the foreground if a separation algorithm based on single - narrow - segment quadratic polynomial fittings is applied .",
    "we exclude the possibility that such a mpc - scale bias is caused by the complex foreground employed in this work , simply by replacing our foreground with that of wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) s and obtaining similar results .",
    "an enlargement of @xmath93 to the order of 10 mhz has been suggested in some previous work ( e.g. , harker et al . 2009b ; petrovic & oh 2011 ) to mitigate the mpc - scale bias .",
    "however , as will be discussed in  3.2.3 and  4 , we do not suggest this method because it will introduce too many auxiliary frequency channels in calculation , a relatively larger bias of @xmath112 , and a relatively poorer determination of the physical conditions of eor when compared with the three - narrow - segment separation approach .      in the following separations , we attempt to introduce more segments and frequency channels into the spectral fittings as auxiliaries to determine the foreground more accurately .",
    "inspired by the fact that the complex foreground can be well approximated with quadratic polynomial expansion in frequency ranges much wider than the largest scales of the 21 cm signals (  3.1 ) , we propose to apply a multi - narrow - segment ( hereafter multi - segment ) quadratic polynomial fitting technique as an attempt to solve the problems raised in  3.2.1 . the frequency resolution and",
    "the number of channels in each segment are @xmath113 khz and @xmath57 , respectively , and the span of the segments is of the order of 10 mhz .",
    "we carry out the foreground fittings by using the same quadratic polynomial as formulated in equation ( 6 ) to approximate the low - frequency foreground simultaneously in three narrow segments , which are separated far away enough to guarantee that the 21 cm signals in different segments come from different ionized bubbles . taking the redshift @xmath86 ( i.e. , reference frequency @xmath114 mhz ) as an example , we define the three segments in such a way that each of them possesses the same bandwidth of @xmath96 mhz as in  3.2.1 , and they are separated by a gap measured either in redshift ( i.e. , a segment combination of @xmath115 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the reference point for segment one , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 for segment two and three , where @xmath118 , respectively ) or in frequency ( i.e. , a segment combination of @xmath119 . here @xmath36 is the reference point for segment one , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 for segment two and three , where @xmath122 mhz , respectively ) .",
    "we use the same method as described in  3.2.1 to restore the 21 cm signals , and evaluate the quality of the results in @xmath123 using the reduced @xmath124 . in general the results",
    "are significantly better than those of the single - narrow - segment and there exists a very weak dependence of separation quality on the segment gap size . taking the segment combination of @xmath125 for example ,",
    "the power spectrum of the 21 cm signals can be recovered very well with the three - narrow - segment approach ( reduced @xmath126 and @xmath127 ; figure 5c ) , which is significantly better than that obtained with the single - narrow - segment separation ( @xmath106 and @xmath109 ) , especially on large scales .",
    "it is found that the use of more than three segments is redundant .",
    "it does not help improve the separation quality but lower the efficiency of calculation .      in order to reduce the systematic bias introduced by possible mis - subtraction of the mpc - scale components in redshifted 21 cm signals in single - narrow - segment quadratic polynomial fittings ,",
    "petrovic & oh ( 2011 ) qualitatively mentioned that a larger segment width should be adopted , especially in restoring the 21 cm signals in late reionization stages when the hii bubble size becomes sufficiently large .",
    "the similar problem was also briefly mentioned by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who suggested an enlargement of @xmath93 by a factor of ten . to investigate if this is feasible we repeat the single - segment separation calculations described in  3.2.1 for another 10000 rounds by increasing the segment width to @xmath128 mhz * ( @xmath129 ) * and examine the changes in the results .",
    "the goodness of fittings is much better than that of fittings with single - narrow - segment fittings ( table 3 ) , which supports the ideas of petrovic & oh ( 2011 ) and wang et al .",
    "however , we note that in single - wide - segment fittings the goodness of both the reduced @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( figure 5 ) are a bit worse when compared with those of our three - narrow - segment fittings ( reduced @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "in addition , as will be shown in  4.2 , single - wide - segment quadratic polynomial separation technique can not yield the best constraints on the physical conditions of eor .",
    "we have also tried to enlarge @xmath132 from 40 khz to 100 khz , which would reduce the required observing time to achieve @xmath77 mk .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5(d)-(f ) , in which we can find our three - narrow - segment method still works well , whereas the information of smaller scales would be lost due to the sampling reduction of frequency .",
    "the differences between the results obtained with single - segment and multi - segment separation approaches can be explained as follows . in the late stage of cosmic reionization ( since @xmath133 depending on models ; e.g. , morales & wyithe 2010 for a recent review ; santos et al .",
    "2008 ) most of the hii bubbles have been well developed .",
    "for example , by simulating the reionization process using the lagrangian perturbation theory , mesinger & furlanetto ( 2007 ) predicted that at @xmath2 the bubble size @xmath134 ( corresponding to a frequency span of @xmath135 ) should range from @xmath136 mpc ( @xmath137 mhz ) to @xmath138 mpc ( @xmath139 mhz ) with a clear peak at @xmath13 mpc ( @xmath140 mhz ) in number distribution .",
    "this means that the 21 cm signals can possess slowly - varying components in frequency space on @xmath141 mhz scales . in single - narrow - segment ( e.g. , @xmath96 mhz ) separations ,",
    "the hii bubble size @xmath135 is comparable to or even larger than the chosen @xmath42 .",
    "this makes it inevitable that a significant part of the mpc - scale 21 cm components is treated as a part of foreground , which is smooth on @xmath142 mhz scales , and then mis - subtracted ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in single - segment separations with a larger @xmath93 ,",
    "as the segment width increases to @xmath143 , the contributions of more than one hii bubbles located along line of sight are involved in the spectra to be fitted .",
    "since the bubble and foreground components vary on quite different scales within the segment , the problem of mis - subtraction can be significantly mitigated , except that the power restorations for mpc - scale components are not fully constrained ( table 3 ) , mostly due to the appearance of giant bubbles that contribute smooth components on tens of mpc scales . in three - narrow - segment separation fittings with narrow @xmath42 ,",
    "the mpc - scale 21 cm components in different segments come from different bubbles , i.e. , they do not correlate with each other whereas the foreground components in the three segments do .",
    "therefore the foreground and 21 cm signals are best determined , respectively .",
    "this can also be clearly seen when the noise is sufficiently low ( e.g. , @xmath144 mk ) , although the realistic condition ( e.g. , @xmath95 mk ) follows the same rule .",
    "taking @xmath144 mk as an example , we repeat the separation using single - narrow - segment , three - narrow - segment , and single - wide - segment separation approaches with 1000 rounds , respectively . we evaluate the result of each round in a quantitative way by calculating the relative root - mean - square error ( rrmse hereafter ) as follows , @xmath145 ^ 2 } } } { { |t_{\\rm 21cm}(\\nu)|}_{\\rm max}}$ ] . with the single - narrow - segment approach",
    ", only @xmath146 of the 1000 cases can yield acceptable ( @xmath147 ; figure 7 and see an example in figure 8) results .",
    "we find that failed ( @xmath148 ; figure 7 and see an example in figure 9 ) restorations tend to occur when the 21 cm signals possess significant large - scale ( @xmath149 ) components along line of sight , which contribute a non - negligible part to the simulated 21 cm spectra ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the best restoration of the 21 cm signals can be obtained with the three - narrow - segment fitting technique ( figures 7 and 9 ; table 4 ) , and in single - wide - segment fittings the scatter of power restoration on @xmath3 mpc scales is larger when compared with our three - narrow - segment fittings ( table 4 ) .",

    "2003 , 2005 ;  2.1 ) predicts that the hii bubbles are growing in their earlier stage and less extended , the separation quality of our three - narrow - segment approach is still the best , although statistically the separation quality of the single - wide - segment approach is almost equally good .      in fiducial reionization models such as the one adopted in this work ( eq .",

    "well restored 21 cm powers will greatly help derive @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and then deduce hii bubble size and growth rate . since powers integrated in different scale ranges follow different contour lines on the @xmath154 diagram ( e.g. , @xmath155 and @xmath156 on fig .",
    "11 ) , it is feasible to constrain @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously using the overlapping area of any two of these contours ( fig .",
    "12 ) , the accuracy of which depends on how accurate we can restore the corresponding 21 cm powers . in figure 12 and table 3",
    "we clearly see that , for an ideal noise condition ( 1 mk ) , the tightest constraints ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) are obtained using the powers restored with our three - narrow - segment separation approach , when compared with the input model values ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; santos et al .",
    "when using the single - wide - segment approach , the obtained @xmath161 and @xmath162 are also unbiased but their errors are larger by about one order of magnitude compared with three - narrow - segment approach .",
    "when using the single - narrow - segment approach both of the constraints ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) are very poor . for a realistic noise condition",
    "( 60 mk ) , the three - narrow - segment separation approach still works well ( @xmath165 and @xmath166 ; fig . 13 and table 3 ) whereas the single - wide - segment approach introduces larger errors in the result ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) . in such a sense",
    "we conclude that the three - narrow - segment quadratic polynomial fitting technique is the best approach to restore the 21 cm signals .",
    "we have also studied whether or not our three - segment separation technique can be applied to intermediate frequency bands to detect the characteristic bao signals ( ansari et al .",

    "as shown in figure 14 and table 6 , the three - segment separation approach ( e.g. , @xmath187 for @xmath188 ) yields better results than the single - segment separation approach ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the power loss in the reconstruction for the @xmath19 mpc scale structures is @xmath190 with three - segment separation approach while @xmath191 with single - segment separation approach .",
    "therefore we conclude that the three - segment separation approach can successfully restore the 21 cm signals from intermediate redshifts better than the single - segment approach , showing its potential to be employed in detecting the bao signals that typically possess characteristic @xmath21 comoving mpc scales .",
    "more details on the simulation of the bao signals and its separation from the foreground will be presented in the next paper since it is beyond the scope of this work .",
