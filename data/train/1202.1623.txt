    "our findings offer insight for constructing an `` early warning system '' for financial markets . by providing a simple instrument to identify similarities to previous states during an upcoming crisis",
    ", one can judge the current situation properly and be prepared to react if the crisis materializes .",
    "another indication for a crisis is given when the correlation structure undergoes rapid changes .",
    "using the similarity measure we were able to classify several typical market states between which the market jumps back and forth .",
    "some of these states can easily be identified in the similarity measure .",
    "however , there are several states in which the market only stays for a short period .",
    "thus , these states are sparsely embedded in time . with a clustering analysis",
    ", we were able to identify these states and disclose a detailed dynamics of the market s state .",
    "a possible application of the similarity measure is risk management .",
    "given the similarity measure , the portfolio manager is aware of periods in which the market behaved completely differently and thus can choose not to include them in his calculations",
    ". he can furthermore identify regions in which the market behaved similarly and refer to these regions when estimating the correlation matrix .",
    "our empirical study is a first step towards the identification of states in financial markets which are a prominent example of complex non - stationary systems .",
    "let @xmath22 be the price of a specific stock and @xmath23 the interval on which the return is calculated . for our study , we chose the arithmetic return , defined as @xmath24 for dataset ( i ) , we chose @xmath23 to be 1 day and calculate the stock returns of each day .",
    "for dataset ( ii ) , we chose @xmath23 as 1 hour . furthermore , we obtain this 1-hour return for every minute of a trading day between 10:45am and 2:45pm .",
    "we obtain the daily data of dataset ( i ) from _ finance.yahoo.com_. the intraday data is obtained from the new york stock exchange s taq database .",
    "sudden changes in drift and volatility can result in erroneous correlation estimates . to address this problem",
    ", we employ a local normalization method @xcite . for each return",
    "@xmath25 we subtract the local mean and divide by the local standard deviation , @xmath26 the local average @xmath27 runs over the @xmath28 most recent sampling points .",
    "for daily data , @xmath29 yields nearly normal distributed time series , as recently discussed  @xcite .",
    "our clustering analysis is based on a top - down scheme : all the correlation matrices are initially regarded as a single cluster and then divided into two clusters by the procedure based on the k - means algorithm @xcite .",
    "each division step consists of the following process :    1 .",
    "choose two initial cluster centers from all matrices .",
    "label all other matrices by the more similar cluster center in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "1 .   recast two new cluster centers to the `` center of mass '' 2 .   re - label",
    "all matrices to their most similar cluster center .",
    "3 .   repeat this process until there is no change in labeling .",
    "we stop this division process when the average distance from each cluster center to its members becomes smaller than certain threshold . to identify the typical market states presented in the manuscript , we chose the threshold at 0.1465 as it represents the best ratio between the distances between clusters and their intrinsic radius .",
    "one can obtain finer structures by choosing smaller threshold values , ultimately until all the matrices are identified as different components .",

    "<S> success in this respect would allow to get a better understanding of the system and might even lead to methods for controlling the system in more efficient ways .    </S>",
    "<S> we here concentrate on financial markets because of the easy access we have to good data , because of our previous experience and last but not least because of the strong non - stationary effects recently seen . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the s&p 500 stocks in the 19-year period 1992 - 2010 . here , we propose such an above mentioned definition of state for a financial market and use it to identify points of drastic change in the correlation structure . </S>",
    "<S> these points are mapped to occurrences of financial crises . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a wide variety of characteristic correlation structure patterns exist in the observation time window , and that these characteristic correlation structure patterns can be classified into several typical `` market states '' . </S>",
    "<S> using this classification we recognize transitions between different market states . a similarity measure </S>",
    "<S> we develop thus affords means of understanding changes in states and of recognizing developments not previously seen .    </S>",
    "<S> the effort to understand the dynamics in financial markets is attracting scientists from many fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> statistical dependencies between stocks are of particular interest , because they play a major role in the estimation of financial risk @xcite . since the market itself is subject to continuous change , the statistical dependencies also change in time . </S>",
    "<S> this non - stationary behavior makes an analysis very difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> changes in supply and demand can even lead to a two phase behavior of the market @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the correlation matrix to identify and classify the market state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we ask , how similar is the present market state , compared to previous states ? to calculate this _ similarity _ we measure temporal changes in the statistical dependence between stock returns .    for stationary systems described by a ( generally large ) number @xmath0 of time </S>",

    "<S> it is necessary to consider data over large time horizons @xmath9 so as to obtain reliable statistics . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a fundamental problem that arises in the case of _ non - stationary _ systems : to extract useful information from empirical data we seek a correlation matrix from very recent data , in order to provide a good description of current correlation structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is because correlations change dynamically due to the non - stationarity of the process , making it very difficult to estimate them precisely @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the length @xmath9 of the time series is short , the correlation matrices @xmath8 are noisy . on the other hand , to keep the estimation error low , @xmath9 can be increased , but this leads to a correlation matrix that generally does not describe the present state very well . </S>",
    "<S> various noise reduction techniques provide methods to conquer noise @xcite .    in several non - stationary systems , it is possible to obtain a large number of correlated data over time . </S>",
    "<S> such systems include , but are not restricted to , financial markets ( which show non - stationary behavior due to crises ) , biological or medical time series ( such as eeg ) , chemical and nuclear reactors ( non - stationary behavior includes , in particular , accidents ) or weather data . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we only consider the financial markets , since we have studied extensively some very high quality data of this system , the non - stationary features of which have been quite striking in the last years . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a definition of a state which is appropriate for such systems and suggest a method of analysis which allows for a classification of possible behaviors of the system . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath10 , which is the case we are interested in , the correlation matrix becomes singular . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can still make significant statistical statements , e.g. , for the average correlation level whose estimation error decreases as @xmath11 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on correlation matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 at different times @xmath14 and @xmath15 measured over a _ short _ time horizon . </S>",
    "<S> these have therefore a pronounced random element . </S>",
    "<S> we take these objects as the fundamental states of our system . </S>",
    "<S> we now propose , as a central element , to introduce the following concept of distance between two states . </S>",
    "<S> we define    @xmath16    to quantify the difference of the correlation structure for two points in time , where @xmath17 denotes the absolute value and @xmath18 denotes the average over all components . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this case , the random component that is unavoidable in the definition of the states of the system is strongly suppressed by the average over @xmath19 numbers .    to apply the above general statements to a specific example , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two datasets : ( i ) we calculate @xmath20 based on the daily returns of those s&p 500 stocks that remained part of the s&p during the 19-year period 19922010 , and ( ii ) we study the four - year period 20072010 in more detail based on intraday data from the nyse  taq database . since the noise increases for very high - frequency data @xcite , we extract one - hour returns for dataset ( ii ) . for one - hour returns , we consider this market microstructure noise as reasonably weak .    </S>",
    "<S> however , sudden changes in drift and volatility are present on all time scales . they can result in erroneous correlation estimates . to address this problem , </S>",
    "<S> we employ a local normalization @xcite of the return time series in dataset ( i ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ img : nat - marketsim ] . in this figure , each point is calculated on correlation matrices over the previous two months . </S>",
    "<S> this new representation gives a complete overview about structural changes of this financial market of the past 19 years in a single figure . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to compare the similarity of the market states at different times . to make this procedure concrete , </S>",

    "<S> light shading denotes similar market states and dark shading denotes dissimilar states . </S>",
    "<S> we can furthermore identify times of financial crises with dark shaded areas . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the correlation structure completely changes during a crisis . </S>",
    "<S> there are also similarities between crises , as between the `` credit crunch '' that induced the 20082009 financial crisis and the `` market meltdown '' , the burst of the dot - com bubble in 2002 . </S>",

    "<S> we calculate the correlation matrices on shorter time scales . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a time horizon of one week , which , because it provides insight into changes in the correlation structure on a much finer time scale , enables us to identify a short sub - period within the 20082009 crisis ( in the beginning of 2009 ) during which the market temporarily stabilizes before it returns to the crisis state . </S>",
    "<S> while the correlation structure during the crisis displays an overall high correlation level , the correlation structure of the stable period is similar to the period before the crisis , one of the typical states in a calm period , which is identified from daily data in dataset ( i ) . </S>",
