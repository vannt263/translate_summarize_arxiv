    "the most recent observations by the planck satellite confirmed that @xmath7 of the universe content in the form of dm and the usual visible matter only accounts for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the lsp remains one of the best candidates for the dm @xcite .",
    "it is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) that can naturally account for the observed relic density of dm .    despite the absence of direct experimental verification , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is still the most promising candidate for a unified theory beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "susy is a generalization of the space - time symmetries of the quantum field theory that links the matter particles ( quarks and leptons ) with the force - carrying particles , and implies that there are additional ` superparticles ' necessary to complete the symmetry . in this",
    "regards , susy solves the problem of the quadratic divergence in the higgs sector of the sm in a very elegant natural way .",
    "the most simple supersymmetric extension of the sm , which is the most widely studied , is know as the mssm @xcite . in this model , certain universality of soft susy breaking terms",
    "is assumed at grand unification scale .",
    "therefore , the susy spectrum is determined by the following four parameters : universal scalar mass @xmath9 , universal gaugino mass @xmath10 , universal trilinear coupling @xmath11 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of higgs bosons @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , due to @xmath13-parity conservation , susy particles are produced or destroyed only in pairs and therefore the lsp is absolutely stable , implying that it might constitute a possible candidate for dm , as first suggested by goldberg in 1983 @xcite .",
    "so although the original motivation of susy has nothing to do with the dm problem , it turns out that it provides a stable neutral particle and , hence , a candidate for solving the dm problem .",
    "the landmark discovery of the sm - like higgs boson at the lhc , with mass @xmath14  gev @xcite , might be an indication for the presence of susy .",
    "indeed , the mssm predicts that there is an upper bound of 130  gev on the higgs mass .",
    "however , this mass of lightest higgs boson implies that the susy particles are quite heavy .",
    "this may justify the negative searches for susy at the lhc - run i @xcite .",
    "however , it is clearly generating a new ` little hierarchy problem ' .",
    "moreover , the relic density data @xcite and upper limits on the dm scattering cross sections on nuclei ( lux @xcite and other direct detection experiments @xcite ) impose stringent constraints on the parameter space of the mssm @xcite .",
    "in fact , combining the collider , astrophysics and rare decay constraints @xcite almost rule out the mssm .",
    "it is tempting therefore to explore well motivated extensions of the mssm , such as nmssm @xcite and blssm @xcite , which may alleviate the little hierarchy problem of the mssm through additional contributions to higgs mass @xcite and also provide new dm candidates @xcite that may account for the relic density with no conflict with other phenomenological constraints .    in this article",
    "we analyze the constraints imposed by the higgs mass limit and the gluino lower bound , which are the most stringent collider constraints , on the mssm parameter space .",
    "in particular , these constraints imply that the gaugino mass , @xmath10 , resides within the mass range : @xmath15  gev",
    ". while the other parameters are much less constrained .",
    "we study the effect of the measured dm relic density on the mssm allowed parameter space . we emphasized that in this case all parameter space is ruled out except few points around @xmath16 , @xmath17  tev and @xmath18  tev .",
    "we also investigate the direct detection rate of the lsp at these allowed points in light of the latest lux result .",
    "finally we show that if one assumes non - standard scenario of cosmology with low reheating temperature , where the lsp may reach equilibrium before the reheating time , then the relic abundance constraints on @xmath19 can be significantly relaxed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly introduce the mssm and study the constraints on the @xmath20 plane from higgs and gluino mass experimental limits . in section 3",
    "we study the thermal relic abundance of the lsp in the allowed region of parameter space .",
    "we show that the combined lhc and relic abundance constraints rule out most of the parameter space except the case of very large @xmath12 .",
    "we also provide the expected rate of direct lsp detection at these points with large @xmath12 and tev masses .",
    "section 4 is devoted for non - thermal scenario of dm and how it can relax the constraints imposed on mssm parameter space .",
    "finally we give our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the particle content of the mssm is three generations of ( chiral ) quark and lepton superfields , the ( vector ) superfields necessary to gauge the @xmath21 gauge of the sm , and two ( chiral ) @xmath22 doublet higgs superfields .",
    "the introduction of a second higgs doublet is necessary in order to cancel the anomalies produced by the fermionic members of the first higgs superfield , and also to give masses to both up and down type quarks .",
    "the interactions between higgs and matter superfields are described by the superpotential @xmath23 here @xmath24 contains @xmath22 ( s)quark doublets and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the corresponding singlets , ( s)lepton doublets and singlets reside in @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . while @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote higgs superfields with hypercharge @xmath31 .",
    "further , due to the fact that higgs and lepton doublet superfields have the same @xmath32 quantum numbers , we have additional terms that can be written as @xmath33 these terms violate baryon and lepton number explicitly and lead to proton decay at unacceptable rates . to forbid these terms a new symmetry , called @xmath13-parity , is introduced , which is defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are baryon and lepton number and @xmath37 is the spin .",
    "there are two remarkable phenomenological implications of the presence of @xmath13-parity : @xmath38 susy particles are produced or destroyed only in pair . @xmath39",

    "in addition the mssm contains another two free susy parameters : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "two of these free parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath35 , can be determined by the electroweak breaking conditions : ^2 & = & -m_z^2/2 , [ minimize1 ] + 2&= & .",
    "[ minimize2 ] thus , the mssm has only four independent free parameters : @xmath50 , besides to the sign of @xmath48 , that determine the whole spectrum .    in the mssm",
    ", the mass of the lightest higgs state can be approximated , at the one - loop level , as @xcite m_h^2 m_z^2 + ( ) .[deltat ] therefore , if one assumes that the stop masses are of order tev , then the one - loop effect leads to a correction of order @xmath51  gev , which implies that m_h^mssm 135  gev.the two - loop corrections reduce this upper bound by a few gevs @xcite .",
    "hence , the mssm predicts the following upper bound for the higgs mass : @xmath52  gev , which was consistent with the measured value of higgs mass ( of order 125  gev ) at the lhc @xcite .    in fig .",

    "it can vary from few hundred gevs to few tevs .",
