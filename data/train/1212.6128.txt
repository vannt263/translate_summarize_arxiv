    "<S> first , we investigate the analogy of nonlinear charged black hole solutions with the van der waals liquid  gas system in the extended phase space where the cosmological constant appear as pressure . </S>",
    "<S> then , we plot isotherm @xmath0@xmath1 diagram and study the thermodynamics of ads black hole in the ( grand canonical ) canonical ensemble in which ( potential ) charge is fixed at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find the phase transition occurs in the both of canonical and grand canonical ensembles in contrast to rn black hole in maxwell theory which only admits canonical ensemble phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we calculate the critical exponents and find their values are the same as those in mean field theory . besides , we find in the grand canonical ensembles universal ratio @xmath2 is independent of spacetime dimensions . </S>"
