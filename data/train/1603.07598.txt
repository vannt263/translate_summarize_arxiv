    "the mechanics and physics of soft materials are intrinsically complex due to the strongly time - dependent and usually non - linear constitutive stress - strain relations that govern their response .",
    "further intricacy is added when soft bodies are brought into contact and the problem is exacerbated by the geometry of the intimately mating surfaces . in the last two decades , the continuously growing technological relevance of engineering applications involving polymeric materials and soft tissues _ _  _ _ has generated enormous interest in the scientific community and has contributed to a leap in the number of publications in the field gorb , bio3,vertebrae ; these span investigations performed across the scales , from macroscopic to atomistic levels , and include analytical hunter , persson2001 numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of these vast research efforts , our understanding of soft matter problems is definitely far from being complete .    in this paper , we focus our attention on an issue that has been systematically ignored but has a crucial importance : the reciprocating contact of viscoelastic materials , where the relative motion between the contacting bodies is periodically inverted . indeed , researchers have almost universally developed models to investigate unidirectional steady - state sliding between two mating surfaces made of viscoelastic material persson2001,carboneputignano .",
    "however , steady - state assumption can not be considered a universally valid condition .",
    "there is a countless variety of engineering applications , ranging from the macro- to the nano- scales , where a periodic inversion of the motion direction is present . earthquake viscoelastic dampers are a classic example @xcite .",
    "these devices are embedded in civil structures to limit the consequences of earthquakes by introducing a source of damping , that is , beyond the several possible configurations , the hysteretic dissipation occurring when a set of rigid punches deforms a layer of rubber .",
    "currently , the design in this field mostly relies on practical and empirical guidelines , and no tool for quantitative predictions is available .",
    "this lack of a robust theoretical framework involves also very different components , like all the sealing systems in mechanical applications with an alternate motion @xcite . indeed",
    ", enhancing performances and efficiency is infeasible without an accurate knowledge of the interfacial stresses and , consequently , of the dissipated power .",
    "finally , reciprocating contacts have prominence also at different scales and in different contexts , like biology and biotechnology ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "skin , ocular system , joints , spine and vertebrae are some of the examples where viscoelastic soft contact occurs in the human body . as recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be observed up to the cell scale , thus introducing the concept of cell friction .",

    "we develop a theoretical approach and a numerical technique that , for the first time , allow studying reciprocating contact mechanics between linearly viscoelastic solids and provide predictions of the response of the contacting surfaces in terms of stresses , strain and friction .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section ii describes the mathematical formulation which the numerical methodology relies on .",
    "section iii focuses on a simple , tough explicative , case , i.e. the reciprocating sliding contact of a sphere over a viscoelastic layer .",
    "final remarks are included to comment on the relevance of the theory and of the results .",
    "appendixes a and b respectively discuss the validity range of the model and provide a comparison with steady - state conditions .",
    "the proposed formulation builds on the strengths of the boundary element method ( bem ) in terms of accurately capturing interfacial stresses and displacements , and , as such , requires the determination of a viscoelastic reciprocating green s function @xmath0 .    to this end , let us first assume that the interfacial normal stress distribution obeys the law @xmath1 $ ] , i.e. that the shape of normal stress distribution is fixed but moves on the viscoelastic half - space with a sinusoidal law of amplitude @xmath2 and angular frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the vector @xmath4also identifies the direction of the reciprocating motion .",
    "because of linearity and translational invariance , replacing @xmath5 allows to write the relation between interfacial stresses and displacement as@xmath6 in order to determine @xmath0 , we recall that the general relation between stress and displacement fields is carboneputignano :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the elastic green s function and the creep material function respectively .",
    "the symbol ` @xmath10 ' stands for the time derivative . the creep function",

    "this assumption is justified in the majority of cases of reciprocating contact , and is satisfied point - wise almost everywhere within the contact area in the analyses presented in this work .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) we need a numerical approach which consists in discretizing the contact domain in @xmath46 square cells .",

    "it should be observed that eq .",
    "( [ eqfinale ] ) is obtained by applying the chebishev - gauss quadrature rule to the integral term @xmath53 \\left ( 1-s^{2}\\right ) ^{-1/2}$ ] at @xmath46 nodes , thus making it easier to achieve the numerical convergence of the problem .",
    "( [ visco_principle ] ) can be solved by using the iterative technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for elastic contacts , thus providing contact areas , stresses and strains .",
    "it should be noticed that the method does not require any discretization of the time domain as the time @xmath54 is treated as a parameter .",
    "once the solution is known in terms of stresses and strains , following the approach stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is straightforward to calculate the viscoelastic friction force as :    @xmath55    the friction coefficient is then obtained as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the external applied load .    finally , we conclude noticing that the formulation , in the current form , does not explicitly account for the role of the tangential tractions at the contact interface . indeed , this is out of the scope of our work .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to determine the normal stresses and the normal displacements distribution , and , on this basis , calculate the viscoelastic friction that is proportional to the volume of deformed material .",
    "it is well known that the normal and tangential contact problems have only a very weak coupling , which is normally neglected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a rigid body in contact with a soft layer which can be usually assumed incompressible- , it is absolutely rigorous to assert that tractions has no influence on normal pressure and displacements , and , consequently , on the viscoelastic dissipation @xcite .",
    "we study the contact of a rigid sphere of radius @xmath58 undergoing reciprocating sliding against a viscoelastic material characterized by one relaxation time ( being the ratio between the high frequency modulus and the low frequency @xmath59 and the poisson ratio @xmath60 ) .",
    "we assume that the center @xmath61 of the sphere moves on the viscoelastic half - space following the law @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the dimensionless angular frequency of the reciprocating motion is @xmath63 @xmath64 , being @xmath19 the relaxation time of the viscoelastic material .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the evolution of the dimensionless displacements ,  @xmath65 , at the centre of the contact as a function of @xmath66 and for a specific dimensionless applied normal load @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "results are shown for different values of @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "an arrow refers , in each case , to the current position of the sphere . at @xmath70 the sphere",
    "has just reached the left dead - point and starts moving from left to right . upon reversal of the sliding direction , and for @xmath71 , a marked increase of the dimensionless penetration at the center of the sphere is observed .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although the speed is increasing , it is still too low to cause a significant stiffening of the material , and the sphere is also moving over a portion of the viscoelastic half - space that has not yet had the time to relax after the previous contact of the rigid body . as the sliding speed increases , a non negligible stiffening of the material and a marked decrease of the penetration are observed ( see displacement in correspondence to the arrow ) .",
    "this is clearly shown by curves at @xmath72 , which also show additional deformation peaks , one at the left and one to the right of the arrow : this is the result of the interplay between the deformations , induced by the indenter as it moves to the right , and the original not yet fully relaxed footprints left by the sphere at preceding times . for @xmath73 , the sliding speed begins to decrease and the material softens again , thus leading to an increase of penetration .",
    "it is now possible to justify the occurrence of three different deformations peaks within the track when the sphere is moving between the two dead - ends : one corresponds to the current position of the sphere and the other two are located close to the left and right dead - points respectively , and are the result of the material inability to fully recover the viscoelastic deformations during a period of time comparable to the period @xmath74 @xmath75of the reciprocating motion ( recall that the relaxation time is @xmath76 ) .",
    "the merging or separation of the previous and current sphere footprints , which takes place close to the dead - points of the reciprocating motion , has a significant effect on the interfacial normal stress distribution .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ figure2 ] , which depicts the evolution of the pressure distribution and shows the shape of the contact area .",
    "let us first observe that at @xmath77 @xmath78 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the sliding speed goes to zero , the contact area as well as the interfacial normal stress distribution are characterized by an asymmetric shape . the observed asymmetry and , in particular ,",
    "the presence of a peak on the left of the contact patch is a consequence of the viscoelastic time - delay which prevents the material to relax immediately when the sliding speed vanishes . as the sphere starts moving to the right",
    ", such a peak can not disappear suddenly but has to show a gradual decrease . at the same time , since the punch is travelling towards the right , as already observed in steady - state viscoelastic contacts moving at constant velocity @xcite , a peak in the pressure distribution has to be originated also at the leading edge .",
    "finally , at the center of the distribution , where we have the maximum of the displacement field in the contact area , the pressure must still resemble the classical elastic hertzian solution .",
    "all this  process strongly affects the evolution of the pressure distribution at the interface with the presence of multiple pressure peaks shown by the snapshots taken at @xmath79 ( the reader may refer to appendix b to appreciate the difference with steady - state conditions ) . a single peaked pressure distribution is later recovered : indeed , an asymmetric pressure profile marked by a peak closer to the contact leading edge is visible at @xmath77 @xmath80 .",
    "we may observe that , for a single relaxation time material , in addition to the ratio @xmath81 , the behavior of the reciprocating contact is also governed by other two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first dimensionless group is @xmath82 @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85is the hertzian contact radius .",
    "this parameter can be also interpreted as a dimensionless sliding speed @xcite and compares the relaxation time @xmath19 with the time @xmath86 needed by the sphere to cover a distance @xmath44 .",
    "the second group , @xmath87 , compares , instead , the time @xmath86 with the period @xmath88 of the reciprocating motion . since we have earlier assumed that in our problem @xmath89 , we can focus on observing how the solution is affected by @xmath90 . for extremely small or extremely high values of @xmath91",
    "the response of the system is elastic ( governed by either the high or the low frequency elastic limit of the material ) , and no tangential contact force will be generated . at intermediate values of @xmath92",
    ", viscoelasticity will affect the solution leading to asymmetric contact areas and pressure distributions , and to the generation of tangential contact forces .",
    "in such a case , given the dimensionless parameter @xmath93 , if @xmath94 , the reciprocating motion will occur on time - scales longer than the relaxation time @xmath19 of the material and the system will resemble the steady - state behavior of the contact between a sphere moving on a viscoelastic half - space at constant speed @xcite .",
    "if @xmath95 , as in the case of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , a strong interaction will be observed between different viscoelastic regions of the path covered by the sphere during the reciprocating motion .",
    "note that , under the assumption small @xmath96 values ( which has been always adopted in this paper ) , the condition @xmath97 implies @xmath98 , and , in this case , the elastic response of the material will be recovered : the sphere will be just performing very fast oscillations , leading to a local stiffening and , ultimately , to a high frequency elastic behavior .    in figure [ figure3 ] ,",
    "the reduced tangential force , @xmath99 , easily calculated once pressures and displacements are known @xcite , is plotted as a function of the dimensionless abscissa @xmath66 , which identifies the position of the sphere along the path , for different values of @xmath100 . for @xmath101 the material has the possibility to relax before a single reciprocating cycle is completed . in this case , as the solution resembles the steady - state viscoelastic sliding contact , the tangential force @xmath99 always opposes the sphere speed at each point along the path .",
    "however , as @xmath100 is increased ( see _ e.g. _ results for @xmath102 presented in figure [ figure3 ] ) the relaxation of the material involves time scales comparable to the time period of the reciprocating motion ; in this case , there exist regions on the sphere track , specifically those close to the dead - points , where @xmath99 has the same direction as the sliding speed .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the results presented in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "this work provides the explicit solution , in terms of a fourier series , of the green s function of the reciprocating contact problem between a rigid punch and a linear viscoelastic solid .",
    "the periodic features , intrinsically marking the problem , enables the parametric calculation of the contact solution for each time step without any necessity of employing the solution in the previous time interval . by implementing such a parametrically time - dependent approach",
    ", we obtain the full numerical convergence in each moment of the cycle and , interestingly , also when the punch inverts its motion .",
    "for the simple case of a sphere in contact with a viscoelastic layer , we show that the behavior of the system is completely determined by two parameters , that are @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath103 _ . _",
    "depending on these two parameters , the viscoelastic reciprocating contact may present a wide variety of different behaviors , ranging from the case that can be captured by the steady - state solution for viscoelastic sliding to the case where such interactions lead to the formation of a multi - peaked interfacial pressure distribution and tangential contact forces in ( rather than opposing ) the direction of the sliding speed .",
    "this may have important implications in terms of design of materials and solutions for different applications as it would enable to accurately capture deformation rates , stress distributions and viscoelastic friction during reciprocation .",
    "indeed , these are the key quantities to understand cell growth and skin / counterface interactions , as well as to predict frictional energy dissipation in _ e.g. _ mechanical seals and earthquake dampers .",
    "when dealing with materials marked by a linear response , the displacement distribution can be related to the interfacial pressures by means of a convolution integral with a time- and space - dependent function , i.e. the green s function .",
    "we may , then , formulate the general contact problem between a rigid indenter and a linearly viscoelastic slab as :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the in - plane position vector , @xmath54 is the time , @xmath106 is the normal surface displacement of the viscoelastic slab , @xmath21 is the normal interfacial stress , @xmath8 and @xmath107 are respectively the elastic green s function and the creep material function .",
    "the relevance of such an approach is related to its generality : no assumption is made _ a priori _ on the shape of the contact domain . indeed , the method can be employed for any kind of contact punch and even for rough surfaces : conditions , like periodic boundaries and finite values of contacting layers thickness , can be easily managed carbone2008,putignanoijss2 . furthermore , since the creep function @xmath108 is absolutely general , the approach is capable of dealing with any linearly viscoelastic material , from skin tissues to rubber - based composites .",
    "however , solving directly eq .",
    "( [ general formulaion ] ) may be extremely challenging : due to the necessity of performing discretization both in time and space , the computational cost is huge and often infeasible with the computational technologies currently available .",
    "consequently , when focusing our attention on the reciprocating contacts , our efforts are aimed at reducing the computational complexity of eq .",
    "( [ general formulaion ] ) without loosing its generality in terms of contact geometry and material properties . indeed , by assuming that the shape of the interfacial normal stress distribution does not change , i.e. assuming that it obeys the law @xmath109 $ ] - where @xmath110 and @xmath3 are respectively the amplitude and angular frequency of the sinusoidal law- , eq .",
    "( [ general formulaion ] ) can be re - written in the form stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this expression has a significant advantage : it does not require any discretization of the time domain since @xmath54 is present just as a parameter of the viscoelastic reciprocating green s function @xmath0 .",
    "such a formulation enables us to employ the efficient computational techniques already developed for the purely elastic case @xcite and , therefore , to find the solution for a reciprocating contact .",
    "incidentally , we observe that , from a physical point of view , passing from eq .",
    "( [ general formulaion ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is fully justified recalling the periodic features of the system under investigation .    in this paper , we determine @xmath0 and investigate the main peculiarities of the reciprocating contact mechanics .",
    "indeed , when developing the mathematical formulation , we rely on the aforementioned condition of a constant shape of the interfacial stress distribution .",
    "recalling that the total time derivative of pressure field is @xmath111 , the condition implies that , the local rate of change in the pressure @xmath112 , which occurs on time - scales of the order of the period @xmath113 of the reciprocating motion , should be negligible compared to the rate of change of pressure due to the convective term @xmath114 , which occurs on time - scale of @xmath86 , where @xmath86 is the time needed by the sphere to cover a distance of the order of the contact radius @xmath44 .",
    "this then requires that @xmath115 .",
    "this can be easily shown by estimating the local time derivative and the convective term and requiring that @xmath116 , i.e.@xmath117where @xmath118 is the maximum contact pressure and , then , by taking the ratio of the derivative terms , one obtains :    @xmath119    at the end of each stroke during reciprocation , the aforementioned condition may look critical since the velocity of the sphere tends to vanish ; however , since the time the sphere spends at the dead points of the cyclic sliding motion is also zero , things have to be observed a bit more carefully .",
    "indeed , we can calculate the time @xmath86 to cover a distance of the order @xmath120 when the sphere starts moving from the dead point : the distance @xmath121 can be estimated as @xmath122 .",
    "one can , then , easily show that @xmath123 ; hence , if @xmath124 , also @xmath125 will be sufficiently small to justify the constant shape assumption also at the dead points .",
    "incidentally , we observe that we have numerically checked the condition @xmath126 for all the cases presented in the main manuscript once the stress distribution was calculated from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to shed light on the unique features of the viscoelastic reciprocating contacts . to this aim , it can be useful here to point out the differences between viscoelastic steady - state sliding and reciprocating conditions . from a physical point of view , the two conditions are almost antithetical : in the steady - state case , the punch always meets underformed material @xcite ; on the contrary , as we explain in the main manuscript , when dealing with reciprocating contacts , the rigid punch may deform a region of material that has not yet relaxed . only in the limit case of very small values of the parameter @xmath100 ,",
    "i.e. given a relaxation time @xmath19 for very small frequencies @xmath3 , the reciprocating case tends to a steady - state - like regime , where the material has got time to relax before the punch re - engages with it .",
    "this physical background entails remarkable differences in terms of interfacial pressures , normal displacements and , consequently , friction . in fig .",
    "[ figab ] , we compare the contour plots of the normal pressure for the two cases , i.e. the reciprocating contact conditions and the sliding steady - state contacts . in fig .",
    "( [ figab]a ) , at the inversion point , i.e. when the speed is nominally equal to zero , in the reciprocating case , the pressure still shows a marked asymmetry , that is the consequence of the viscoelastic time - delay which prevents the material to relax immediately when the sliding speed vanishes . on the contrary , in steady - state conditions , the solution at zero speed can not be anything else that the elastic classic hertzian solution with the zero - frequency modulus @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , given a constant normal load , in this last case , due to the lower modulus , the contact area is much bigger and normal stresses are much smaller .",
    "when the punch starts moving back to the right dead point , we still have remarkable differences in the pressure distributions ( see fig .",
    "( [ figab]b ) .",
    "such differences are also clearly perceived when looking at the normal displacements . upon the motion inversion",
    ", we observe the formation of an additional peak in the displacement distribution : this is impossible in steady - state conditions .",
    "different distributions in terms of pressure and normal displacements lead to a different hysteretic curve ( see figure figure3 in the main manuscript ) , thus highlighting the importance of the unique features that characterize reciprocating contact conditions .",
