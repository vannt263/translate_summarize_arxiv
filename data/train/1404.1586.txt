    "intro      locsub local versions of measurability have been considered by many authors , among them chang @xcite , prikry @xcite , silver @xcite , just to state some .    to cast our introduction into a general framework ,",
    "let us recall some definitions .",
    "if @xmath3 is an ultrafilter over @xmath4 , then @xmath3 is _",
    "@xmath5-decomposable _ if there is a partition of @xmath0 into @xmath6 many classes in such a way that no union of @xmath7 classes belongs to @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently ( [ rmkmeas](1 ) ) , @xmath3 is @xmath5-decomposable if there is a function @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is _ uniform over @xmath10 _ , that is , every member of @xmath9 has cardinality @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the ultrafilter over @xmath5 defined by @xmath11 if and only if @xmath12 .",
    "the relation induced by this `` quotient '' operation is usually called the _ rudin - keisler ( pre-)order _ , thus an ultrafilter @xmath3 is @xmath6-decomposable if and only if there is some ultrafilter uniform over @xmath6 and @xmath13 modulo the rudin - keisler order .",
    "each of the above points of view  through quotients and through partitions  has its own advantages , as we shall discuss in details .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is _",
    "@xmath5-indecomposable _ if it is not @xmath5-decomposable .",
    "if @xmath0 is measurable , then trivially there is a uniform ultrafilter @xmath3 over @xmath0 which is @xmath5-indecomposable for every @xmath14 .",
    "chang @xcite first noticed that the study of @xmath6-decomposability is not trivial , even for small cardinals .",
    "actually , chang dealt with the notion of _ @xmath6-descending incompleteness _ ,",
    "which is nevertheless equivalent to @xmath6-decomposability , for @xmath6 regular .",
    "see @xcite for this and many other equivalences , and for an exhaustive list of references to the subject , which includes works by the mentioned authors and by a. adler , a. w. apter , s. ben - david , m. benda , g. v. udnovski , d. v. udnovski , h .-",

    "in fact , an uncountable cardinal @xmath15 is measurable _ if and only if _ it carries a uniform ultrafilter which is @xmath6-indecomposable for every @xmath14 .",
    "more generally , an ultrafilter is _",
    "@xmath0-complete _ if and only if it is @xmath6-indecomposable for every @xmath14 .",
    "see remark [ rmkmeas](2 ) here , or @xcite for further details .",
    "thus ultrafilters enjoying various degrees of indecomposability furnish weaker `` local '' analogues of measurability , the existence of a @xmath5-indecomposable uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 admits many equivalent formulations in terms of topology , model - theory ( both first order and extended ) , infinite combinatorics , boolean algebras .",
    "see @xcite for examples . in a sense ,",
    "the situation is similar to the one described in the classical paper @xcite by h. j. keisler and a tarski , where a big deal of conditions equivalent to a cardinal being measurable have been worked out .",
    "the existence of a @xmath5-indecomposable uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 , as a local version of the measurability of @xmath0 , and just as measurability itself , can be expressed in equivalent forms in a varied sets of mathematical frameworks .",
    "indeed , the mentioned topological , model theoretical , etc . , characterizations of the existence of a @xmath5-indecomposable uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 can be easily generalized in order to provide , for every set @xmath16 of cardinals , characterizations of the existence of a uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 which for no @xmath17 is @xmath6-decomposable .",
    "when @xmath16 is the set of all cardinals @xmath18 one usually recovers exactly the conditions from @xcite .",
    "wcwwi    the mentioned paper by keisler and tarski contains also many topological , model - theoretical , etc . , equivalent formulations of all the large cardinals known at that time , in particular , also of weak compactness .",
    "it is not apparent how to get `` local '' versions of such results in a sense parallel to the above local versions of measurability . in this case , the situation is made even more difficult by the fact that there are many definitions of weak compactness which turn out to be equivalent only under the assumption that the cardinals at hand are inaccessible ( by _ inaccessible _ we shall always mean , as nowadays usual , _ strongly inaccessible _ ) . though conventional wisdom has suggested that inaccessibility should be included right in the definition of weak compactness , we believe that in such a way the richness of many interesting phenomenons gets lost .",
    "we refer , for example , to earlier topological and measure - theoretical studies by mrwka @xcite , followed by udnovski @xcite , or to a homological theorem by a. mekler mentioned in eklof ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.6 ) .",
    "all these results are partially trivialized by the assumption of inaccessibility .",
    "also the _ tree property _ is equivalent to weak compactness only under the assumption of inaccessibility , and even a successor cardinal may satisfy it , mitchell @xcite .",
    "variants of the tree property have received a notable attention in recent years .",
    "see , e.  g. , fontanella @xcite , viale and wei @xcite , wei @xcite and further references there .",
    "however the properties we are considering here differ from the tree property and from its variants in that they do imply weak inaccessibility .",
    "that strong inaccessibility is effectively necessary for the equivalence of most variants of weak compactness has been verified by boos @xcite , who constructed models in which many such variants do not imply ( strong ) inaccessibility . at the same time , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) boos also finds further equivalent conditions for weak compactness without inaccessibility .    subsequently in @xcite we showed that weak compactness without inaccessibility deeply affects the study of extended logics . in the present note logics",
    "will enter the scene mostly as examples .",
    "roughly , the reader might think of a _ logic _ as an extension of first order logic which satisfies all the properties common both to infinitary logics and to logics with added quantifiers , e.  g. , the quantifier @xmath19 saying `` there are @xmath20 many '' .",
    "an extensive review of the subject can be found in @xcite ; a concise survey of what happened in the last years can be found in @xcite .",
    "exactly in the same way as weakly compact cardinals can be defined as cardinals for which the corresponding infinitary logic satisfies compactness , we showed in @xcite that , for _ every _ logic @xmath21 , the first cardinal @xmath22 such that @xmath21 is @xmath23-compact is weakly compact in the weaker sense that @xmath24 is @xmath23-compact . in case @xmath25 is inaccessible , this is one among the many possible definitions of weak compactness .",
    "thus a cardinal @xmath22 is weakly compact ( in the above weaker sense , and including @xmath26 ) if and only if it is the first cardinal such that some logic is @xmath23-compact . recall that @xmath27 is like first order logic , except that conjunctions and disjunctions of @xmath28 sentences are allowed , as well as simultaneous universal or existential quantification over sets of @xmath29 variables .",
    "a logic is _ @xmath23-compact _ if every @xmath22-satisfiable set @xmath30 of @xmath22 sentences is satisfiable . a set is _",
    "@xmath22-satisfiable _ if every subset of cardinality @xmath28 has a model .",
    "the results from @xcite not only support the conviction that weak compactness without inaccessibility is interesting and deserves further study , but also show that , say , the betelgeusians would have arrived at the very same notions of weak and strong compactness as ours , even had they started by considering entirely different logics .",
    "e  g. , the first weakly compact ( in the above weaker sense ) cardinal @xmath22 is the first cardinal such that @xmath31 is @xmath23-compact .",
    "locwc    as we mentioned , it is not apparent how to introduce local versions of weak compactness analogue to the local versions of measurability described in subsection [ locsub ] , since weak compactness can not be defined by using a single ultrafilter .",
    "we originally devised a model - theoretical approach to the problem in @xcite , again motivated by extended logics .",
    "however , subsequently we found an ostensibly simpler method which uses the following observation , bearing some similarity with mrwka ideas from @xcite . clearly , an _",
    "ultrafilter _ @xmath3 over @xmath0 is @xmath0-complete if and only if whenever we partition @xmath0 into @xmath2 classes , one of these classes is in @xmath3 . hence checking @xmath0-completeness of some ultrafilter over @xmath0 amounts to check it for all the @xmath32 partitions of @xmath0 into @xmath2 classes .",
    "we can pick a subset @xmath1 of all such partitions and only ask that there is some ultrafilter @xmath3 such that none of the above partitions is a witness for the @xmath0-incompleteness of @xmath3 ( the @xmath0-incompleteness of @xmath3 might be or might be not disproved by some partition outside p ) . taking @xmath1 to be the set of all the above partitions gives back the notion of measurability , while making @xmath1 vary among sets of cardinality @xmath0 gives an equivalent formulation of weak compactness .",
    "if gch fails at @xmath0 , we can consider all @xmath1 s of cardinality @xmath33 , for @xmath33 strictly between @xmath0 and @xmath34 .",
    "this provides weak versions of measurability and schanker @xcite , using an equivalent formulation , recently proved that there are models in which such intermediate notions are actually distinct both from measurability and from weak compactness .",
    "see also @xcite",
    ".    pursuing further the idea that @xmath0-completeness is `` composed '' of pieces of @xmath6-indecomposability for @xmath35 , as described in subsection [ locsub ] , and using the observations in the above paragraph , we can introduce a form of `` local weak compactness at @xmath6 '' by asking that @xmath22 many partitions of @xmath0 are not enough to witness that every uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 is @xmath6-decomposable .",
    "let us denoted by @xmath36 the above statement , intended to mean that _ it is not the case _ that `` uniformity on @xmath0 implies ( by means of @xmath22 many partitions ) @xmath6-decomposability '' .",
    "correspondingly , the above statement between quotes will be denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "notice that it might happen that there is indeed a @xmath6-indecomposable uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 ( a local version of measurability at @xmath6 ) , in which case @xmath36 for every @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that every uniform ultrafilter over @xmath0 is @xmath6-decomposable ( `` local measurability '' at @xmath6 fails ) but perhaps all of the @xmath32 partitions of @xmath0 into @xmath6 pieces are necessary to witness this ( or , at least , @xmath32 many partitions are needed ) . in this case @xmath38 , but @xmath36 for every @xmath39 .",
    "we also may have intermediate cases .",
    "we interpret @xmath40 as a local version of weak compactness at @xmath6 , while if @xmath22 grows larger in @xmath37 we go closer and closer to ( local versions ) of measurability .",
    "we sometimes find it convenient to work with functions rather than with partitions ( cf . the two equivalent definitions of @xmath6-decomposability given at the beginning ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath37 by means of functions is given in definition [ def ] ; in lemma [ partitions2](2 ) it is proved equivalent to the definition in terms of partitions sketched above .    in the above discussion",
    "we can consider a set @xmath41 of cardinals in place of @xmath6 , and introduce a similar principle @xmath42 which says that @xmath6-decomposability is witnessed for at least one @xmath17 ( definition [ defl ] ) .",
    "when we take @xmath43 , the set of all infinite cardinals @xmath2 , then @xmath44 corresponds exactly to the measurability of @xmath0 , while @xmath45 corresponds to weak compactness of @xmath0 ( provided we assume either that @xmath0 is inaccessible , or that we are dealing with weaker versions of weak compactness , as described in the previous subsection ) .",
