    "the global ocean dominates the iconic image of earth viewed from space , leading to the now famous `` blue marble '' descriptor for our planet .",
    "the ocean covers more than 70% of the planetary surface and ocean processes are critical to life - sustaining ( and life - challenging ) events and processes occurring across broad ranges of temporal and spatial scales . understanding issues of ocean resource consumption ( e.g. , fisheries , coastal pollution , etc . ) lead to foci on ocean ecosystem dynamics and their coupling to physical processes ( e.g. , mixing , transports , upwelling , ice dynamics , etc . ) .",
    "understanding the ocean role in climate dynamics ( e.g. , sequestration of atmospheric @xmath0 , absorption of atmospheric heat , impacts on the hydrologic cycle , teleconnections , etc . )",
    "lead to foci on massive and complex simulations and forecasts based on equations of geophysical fluid dynamics . in all instances , the broad range of scales , the energetic exchanges across them , and",
    "the associated uncertainties drive innovations that involve methods of modern statistical modeling.=1    oceanography has historically been a `` data poor '' science and the need to use advanced statistical methodology to perform inference and prediction has been paramount throughout its development .",
    "although it is the case that there are too few in situ observations of the ocean to characterize its evolution and its interaction with marine ecosystems , in an ironic twist , the discipline also suffers from having an abundance of particular data types when one factors in the satellite observations that have become available in the last couple of decades .",
    "the need for statistical collaboration in oceanography results from both the situation of not having enough observations in some parts of the system and having huge amounts of data in other parts of the system .",
    "the physical ocean is governed by basic laws of physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the primitive equations consist of the following : three equations corresponding to the conservation of momentum ( for the two horizontal and one vertical components of velocity ) , a continuity equation representing the conservation of mass , an equation of state ( relating density , pressure , temperature and salinity ) , and equations corresponding to the conservation of temperature and salinity .",
    "there are seven state variables ( three velocity components , density , pressure , temperature and salinity ) .",
    "this system of equations is nonlinear and exhibits a huge range of spatial and temporal scales of variability . given that many of these scales of variability are not resolved in data or in deterministic or `` forward '' ocean models , the equations are typically simplified by scale analysis arguments and the small scale ( turbulent ) structures are parameterized .",
    "these parameterizations involve relationships between the mean of the state variables and their gradients . in this way",
    "the eddy viscosity and diffusivity terms serve as so - called `` sub - grid scale '' parameterizations , representing the unresolved processes that are sinks of momentum and heat at the grid scale of a given model , for example , @xmath1  km in global ocean models and @xmath2  km in regional ocean models .",
    "the ocean system is nonlinearly coupled to the atmosphere across a broad range of scales . at the largest scales , air  sea fluxes of heat and fresh water drive mostly vertical or `` thermohaline '' circulations while the surface shear stress and wind stress curl drive mostly horizontal or wind - driven gyre circulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at smaller scales , the vertical - horizontal separation breaks down and the ocean response to external forcing and internal instabilities results in a broadband spectrum of vigorous eddy circulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on all scales ,",
    "the circulation provides the context for ocean processes affecting other components of the ocean system such as those related to ocean biology and chemistry .",
    "there are significant nonlinear interactions between the ocean chemistry , biology and its physical state .",
    "ocean biogeochemistry is concerned with the interaction of the biology , chemistry and geology of the ocean ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a very complex system that contains many interactions across a variety of scales .",
    "the system can be simply illustrated by thinking about the interactions of broad classes of its components .",
    "for example , the presence of nutrients near the ocean surface , where there is light , allows for the growth of phytoplankton , which deplete the nutrients as their population expands .",
    "the increased abundance of phytoplankton then provides a food source for zooplankton , which leads to growth in the zooplankton population .",
    "the consumption of phytoplankton leads to waste products from the zooplankton that settles as detritus to the ocean floor .",
    "as the zooplankton deplete the phytoplankton , the zooplankton population decreases due to the lack of a sufficient food source .",
    "eventually , the detritus at depth is transferred to the surface through upwelling and mixing , providing the nutrients that lead to another bloom in phytoplankton , etc .",
    "this simple four component system is a vast oversimplification , as there are many different species interacting at any one time .",
    "more critically , this lower trophic ecosystem is also coupled to higher levels of the food web , for example , with foraging fish predating the zooplankton , which are in turn predated by higher trophic fish , marine mammals , commercial fishing , etc .",
    "the chemical component of the cycle is critical in several respects .",
    "it provides a way for carbon to be removed from the atmosphere , as the phytoplankton remove carbon from the ocean water and are consumed by the zooplankton .",
    "some of that carbon is contained in the detritus that sinks to the ocean floor , becoming buried in the sediment and leading to a ( temporary ) carbon sink in the global carbon cycle , which is very important in the context of sequestration of carbon relative to potential climate change from greenhouse gases .",
    "in addition , the biological cycle in the ocean is closely tied to the distribution of dissolved oxygen in the water and also influences the distribution of other chemicals , such as silicon , nitrates and phosphates , for example , in the shells of diatoms .",
    "given the complexities in the ocean system , it is not surprising that there are numerous sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , although the large - scale equations of motion are in some sense deterministic , the scale issues that lead to eddy viscosity / diffusivity parameterizations are inherently uncertain .",
    "furthermore , the forms of the linkages between system components ( e.g. , wind stress , heat and moisture fluxes between atmosphere and ocean ) are not known with certainty .",
    "the components of traditional biogeochemical models are even more uncertain , both in terms of the functional forms and parameters .    the process and parameter uncertainty is compounded by the inherent data issues in the ocean system .",
    "in situ observations of the ocean are quite limited in terms of spatial and temporal resolution , and in terms of the variables measured .",
    "for example , it is a painstaking process to measure zooplankton abundance , often requiring a scientist or technician to literally count critters through a microscope .",
    "fortunately , many surface variables can be observed remotely , particularly through satellite proxies . in some cases , for example , near surface winds from scatterometers , sea surface height from altimeters and sea surface temperature ( sst ) from radiometers , the satellite observations are typically quite precise , albeit with gaps corresponding to orbital geometries , swath widths and fields of view . in other cases , for example , ocean color as a proxy for phytoplankton ,",
    "the observational representation of the process is more uncertain , at least on fairly short time scales .",
    "thus , a key issue in state prediction , parameter estimation and inference is to deal with incomplete observations that vary in precision and in spatial and temporal support .",
    "this is particularly important when one considers ocean `` data assimilation , '' that is , the blending of prior information ( e.g. , a numerical solution of the deterministic representation of the ocean state ) with observations .",
    "another traditionally important component of uncertainty in ocean process modeling corresponds to the selection of reduced - dimensional representations of the process .",
    "given the assumption that much of the larger scale processes in the ocean can be represented in a lower dimensional manifold , with smaller scales corresponding to turbulent scales ( that certainly may interact with the larger scale modes , or at least suggest the form of parameterizations or stochastic noise terms ) , there has been considerable attention given to different approaches to obtain the reduced - dimension basis functions .",
    "the choices vary depending on the part of the system being considered as well as whether one is looking at the system diagnostically or predictively .    in the context of statistical models used to describe or predict portions of the ocean system ,",
    "the nature of the error structures is important . given the nonlinearity that is inherent in the system , many process distributions are not well represented bygaussian errors .",
    "in addition , in some cases ( e.g. , biological abundance variables ) the distributions can only have positive support .",
    "the ocean and atmospheric sciences have benefitted from a strong tradition in applying fairly complex statistical methods to deal with many of the uncertainty issues described above . in particular , general monographs such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "provide comprehensive descriptions of traditional methods used to analyze such data .",
    "in addition to overviews of basic statistical concepts , these books describe multivariate methods ( e.g. , principal components  empirical orthogonal functions , canonical correlation analysis , discriminant analysis , etc . ) , spectral methods ( e.g. , cross - spectral analysis ) and dynamically - based reduction methods ( e.g. , principal oscillation patterns ) to facilitate analysis of high - dimensional data that has inherent dependence in time and space .",
    "this is in addition to more focused monographs such as @xcite(@xcite ) , which gives a comprehensive overview ofeigen - decomposition methods , and several books and review papers devoted to various aspects of data assimilation ( see section  [ sec3.1 ] ) .",
    "statistical presentations of many of these methods can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recognizing the challenges related to uncertainty in the ocean system and the need to foster more collaborative research between oceanographers and statisticians , the u.s .",
    "national research council(nrc ) commissioned a panel to write a report on `` statistics and oceanography '' @xcite ; see also the accompanying article by @xcite and published comments .",
    "this report contains a very nice review of physical oceanography for nonoceanographers and outlined the need for research in several key areas , including the change of support problem and the indirect nature of satellite observations , non - gaussian random fields , the incorporation of lagrangian and eulerian data , data assimilation , inverse modeling , model / data comparison and feature identification , to name some of the most prominent .",
    "the report focused on the physical component of the ocean and did not address biogeochemistry nor many issues of current interest , such as climate change and reduced - dimensional representations .",
    "our goal with this review is to provide an overview of some of the advancements that have occurred at the interface of statistics and oceanography since the @xcite report . in particular , we believe strongly that the hierarchical statistical perspective has played a significant role in this development and will focus our review from that perspective .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents a brief discussion of hierarchical modeling , both empirical and bayesian , with some discussion of the need for computational tools .",
    "we note that although this paper is in a statistics journal , we hope that it will generate interest from both statisticians and oceanographers .",
    "for the same reason that we gave a brief and general overview of oceanography above , we will also give a brief and general overview of hierarchical modeling for those readers with little exposure to these ideas .",
    "in section  [ sec3 ] we focus in more depth on examples related to data assimilation and inverse modeling , long lead forecasting and uncertainty quantification in biogeochemical models .",
    "we will follow this review with a brief discussion of current and future challenges in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the idea of hierarchical modeling of scientific processes arose largely out of @xcite , when mark berliner was the director of the geophysical statistics project at the national center for atmospheric research .",
    "the idea , although fundamentally quite simple , was revolutionary in that it provided a probabilistically consistent way to partition uncertainty in systems with complicated data , process and parameter relationships , and coincided with the development and popularization of markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods in bayesian statistics .",
    "as described below , the key idea is to consider the joint model of data , process and parameters as three general linked model components , that is , the data conditioned on the process and parameters , the process conditioned on parameters , and the parameters .",
    "these ideas quickly spread into statistics and subject matter journals in climatology , meteorology , oceanography and ecology , to name a few .",
    "this particular perspective on hierarchical modeling is summarized in several books , including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more traditional bayesian presentations of hierarchical models can be found in many books on bayesian statistics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "statistical modeling and analysis are about the synthesis of information .",
    "this information may come from expert opinion , physical laws , previous empirical results or various observations ",
    "both direct and indirect .",
    "consider the case where we have a scientific process of interest , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "as an example , say that this process corresponds to the near - surface north / south and east / west wind components over a portion of the ocean ( i.e. , a multivariate spatio - temporal process ) .",
    "we also have observed data associated with this process , say @xmath4 , which might come from a satellite - based scatterometer ( i.e. , wind component observations derived from speed and direction that are incomplete in space and time ) .",
    "we assume that we have parameters associated with the measurement process , say @xmath5 , that might represent differences in support and representativeness between the satellite observations and the true wind process at the resolution of interest .",
    "in addition , we assume that there are some parameters , say @xmath6 , that describe the underlying wind process dynamics ( i.e. , the evolution operator and innovation covariances that propagate the joint spatial fields of the wind components through time ) .",
    "thus , using the total law of probability , it is natural to write the decomposition of the joint distribution of the data and process conditioned on the parameters as @xmath7 = [ z | y , \\theta_z ] [ y | \\theta_y ] , \\label{eq : zyhier}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 $ ] is the `` data distribution '' ( or `` data model '' ) and @xmath9 $ ] is the `` process distribution '' ( or `` process model '' ) , and we have assumed conditional independence of the parameters on the distributions of the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : zyhier ] ) .",
    "note , we are using brackets `` @xmath10 $ ] '' to refer to a distribution and the vertical bar `` @xmath11 '' to denote `` conditioned upon . '' clearly , we could also consider an alternative decomposition in which @xmath3  is conditioned on @xmath4 followed by the marginal distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "however , such a decomposition is less scientific as described below .    in traditional statistics",
    ", one might think about the data @xmath4 given some specified distributional form and some associated parameters , @xmath12 ( e.g. , corresponding to a spatio - temporal mean and associated variances and covariances , or their parameterization ) . in the context of ( [ eq : zyhier ] )",
    ", such a distribution arises from integrating out the random @xmath3 process , yielding the distribution @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we are then typically interested in estimating these parameters given the data .",
    "such estimation ( e.g. , maximum likelihood estimation ) does not include an explicit representation of a model for the underlying dynamical wind process , @xmath3 , but rather includes it implicitly through the first and second moments ( as a consequence of the integration ) .",
    "in addition , this distribution accounts for the uncertainty that is due to sampling and measurement .",
    "the question is then why might we be interested in @xmath3 ?",
    "first , in many such applications , one is actually interested in predicting the true , but unobserved process , @xmath3 , rather than just accounting for its ( co)variability .",
    "second , given the complexity of most ocean and atmospheric processes , the multivariate spatiotemporal dependence structures associated with @xmath3 can be very complicated ( e.g. , nonlinear in time , nonstationary in space and/or time ) and potentially very high - dimensional .",
    "this seriouslycomplicates the likelihood - based inference , as it puts much of the modeling burden on the realistic specification of complicated dependence structures .",
    "rather , by focusing attention on the process @xmath3 directly , one can incorporate scientific insight ( e.g. , markovian approximations to mathematical representations of the process , spatially or time - varying parameters , etc . ) and , critically , disentangle the measurement uncertainty ( which can also be quite complicated ) and the process ( co)variability and uncertainty .",
    "that is , marginal means and covariances contain potentially complicated functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which can be difficult to specify without explicitly doing the integration of the random process .",
    "thus , one is effectively trading the complexity of specifying very complicated marginal dependence structures with a more scientific specification of the conditional mean as a random process at the next level of the hierarchy .",
    "this also allows one to focus effort on modeling the conditional error structure in the data stage , without having to try to disentangle the measurement uncertainty with the process ( co)variability .",
    "statisticians will recognize this as just a manifestation of the issue that one faces in traditional mixed - model analysis where one has a choice of considering a marginal model , whereby the random effects are integrated out , or a conditional model , whereby the random effects are predicted and the conditional covariance structure in the data model is simpler ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "applying bayes rule to the hierarchical decomposition in ( [ eq : zyhier ] ) gives @xmath14 \\propto[z | y , \\theta_z ] [ y | \\theta_y ] , \\label{eq : zybayes}\\ ] ] with the normalizing constant obtained by the integral of ( [ eq : zyhier ] ) with respect to the process @xmath3 .",
    "note that this implies that we are updating our knowledge of the process of interest given the data we have observed .",
    "this is the goal of prediction and confirms that the hierarchical decomposition on the rhs of ( [ eq : zybayes ] ) is the more plausible scientific decomposition of the joint distribution of data and process described above in ( [ eq : zyhier ] ) .",
    "clearly , ( [ eq : zybayes ] ) assumes that the parameters are known without uncertainty .",
    "this is seldom the case in reality , although one may have estimates of these parameters from some source and be comfortable with substituting them into  ( [ eq : zybayes ] ) , leading to what @xcite refer to as an empirical hierarchical model ( ehm ) . alternatively , and more realistically for most ocean processes , at least some of the parameters are typically not known , and we are interested in learning more about them or , at least , would like to account for their uncertainty . in this case , we consider the fully - hierarchical or bayesian hierarchical model ( bhm ) : @xmath15 \\propto[z | y , \\theta_z ] [ y | \\theta _ y ] [ \\theta_z , \\theta_y ] , \\label{eq : zybhm}\\ ] ] where one must specify a prior distribution for the parameters @xmath16 $ ] and we note that the normalizing constant integrates over the parameters in addition to the process .",
    "it is often the case that we have information to inform these parameter distributions .",
    "for example , in the case of the wind process described above , we have knowledge about the quality of scatterometer observations of wind components , and recognize that certain turbulent scaling laws must be followed , which can be incorporated through restrictions and informative prior distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "schematically , it is helpful to think about the rhs of ( [ eq : zybhm ] ) by using the following representation of berliner ( @xcite ) : @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad = [ \\mbox{data } | \\mbox{process } , \\mbox{parameters } ] \\\\ & & \\qquad { } \\times [ \\mbox{process } | \\mbox{parameters } ] \\times [ \\mbox{parameters } ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the strength of this hierarchical representation is that it provides a probabilistically consistent way to think about modeling complex systems while quantifying uncertainty .",
    "critically , each of the stages on the rhs of ( [ eq : zybhm ] ) or ( [ eq : bhm ] ) can be split into sub - models . for example , multiple data sets with differing supports can be accommodated with a model such as @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\[-8pt ] \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & \\quad = \\bigl[z^{(1 ) } | y , \\theta_{z^{(1 ) } } \\bigr ] \\bigl [ z^{(2 ) } | y , \\theta_{z^{(2 ) } } \\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to data sets ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) , respectively , with associated parameters@xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : z1z2 ] ) makes the assumption that , conditioned on the true process , both data sets are independent .",
    "this is often a reasonable simplifying assumption and greatly facilitates the combination of data sets ( although this assumption should be verified in specific applications ) .",
    "the parameters and distributional form for the two distributions on the rhs of ( [ eq : z1z2 ] ) can be quite different , perhaps accommodating differing types of spatial or temporal support , and/or measurement and sampling errors .",
    "examples of this in the context of the wind example discussed previously are data from satellite scatterometers as well as data from ocean buoys or even weather center analysis winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also important to note that the process model component on the rhs of ( [ eq : zybhm ] ) or ( [ eq : bhm ] ) can also be decomposed into subcomponents .",
    "this could correspond to a hierarchical markov decomposition in time , for example , @xmath23 = \\prod_{t=1}^t [ y_t | y_{t-1}][y_0]$ ] , where @xmath24 . or , it could correspond to a multivariate decomposition , @xmath23 = [ y^{(2 ) } | y^{(1)}][y^{(1)}]$ ] , where @xmath25 .",
    "in both cases , there would also be process model parameters .",
    "clearly , combinations of these types of distributions and other types of dependencies ( e.g. , spatial , spatiotemporal , etc . ) could be considered . in the context of the wind example",
    ", it would be natural for the wind components to be represented by @xmath26 and these could be conditioned on near surface atmospheric pressure fields , say @xmath27 , both of which would be spatiotemporal processes with further conditioning possible .",
    "last , we recognize that a huge advantage of hierarchical models in complicated systems is that the parameters are themselves endowed with potentially quite complex distributions .",
    "that is , they exhibit multivariate dependence between parameters or in terms of space and time , or may themselves be dependent on exogenous information . such complex dependencies in parameters",
    "are very difficult to accommodate in the classical paradigm . as discussed above , in the wind example",
    ", it is critical to specify parameter distributions that adhere to known empirical and theoretical turbulent scaling properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no free lunch !",
    "although the hierarchical modeling paradigm is extremely powerful , it often comes at a substantial computational cost .",
    "in particular , the normalizing constant in ( [ eq : zybhm ] ) involves the integration over all random quantities in the model , which can correspond to a very high - dimensional integration in many applications . given that analytical solutions to these integrals are almost never available in complex models , one has to resort to numerical methods .",
    "in the fully bayesian context this is typically some type of markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the ehm case",
    "represented schematically in ( [ eq : zybayes ] ) , one may be able to work out alternative computational solutions [ e.g. , expectation - maximization ( e  m ) or numerical maximum likelihood or method - of - moments estimation ; e.g. , see chapter  7 of @xcite ] .",
    "it is critical to note that the complexity of these calculations often leads to modifications in model structure to facilitate practical computation .",
    "there have been many examples of hierarchical modeling in the ocean sciences since the late 1990s . in this section",
    "we briefly review some of that work at the interface of statistics and oceanography .",
    "we focus most attention on two data assimilation examples ( ocean vector winds and ocean tracer state estimation ) , long lead forecasting of sst , and uncertainty quantification and assimilation of biogeochemical models . for these topics ,",
    "we present vignettes to illustrate the power of hierarchical modeling from problems we have worked on .",
    "we also briefly describe some of the work at the interface related to other important oceanographic problems .",
    "@xcite summarize data assimilation ( da ) as an approach for optimally blending observations with prior information concerning the system ( i.e. , mathematical representations of mechanistic relationships , model output , etc . ) to obtain a distributional characterization of the true state of the system .",
    "relevant to this overview paper , these concepts originated in the atmospheric and ocean sciences and there is an extensive literature describing various methodologies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in essence ,",
    "da can be thought of as an inverse problem , and one can derive algorithms from numerous perspectives , including optimal estimation theory , variational analysis and bayesian statistics . the bayesian approach to da ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) is helpful because the problem is inherently hierarchical and , thus , it provides a coherent probabilistic approach that can be used to describe the various approaches .",
    "in addition , if one is willing to consider the bhm perspective , one can often obtain a more realistic characterization of uncertainty in various components of the data and mechanistic models ( e.g. , @xcite).=-1    most oceanographic processes of interest in the da context concern spatial fields that vary with time . a  general dynamical spatiotemporal model(dstm ) can be written in the bhm paradigm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the data model is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the data at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 the associated process , where the mapping function , @xmath32 , may be linear or nonlinear , the error process , @xmath33 , may be additive or multiplicative , and the model depends on parameters given by @xmath34 that may be spatial or time - varying .",
    "the process model is given by @xmath35 where the evolution operator @xmath36 may be linear or nonlinear for the oceanographic process of interest , the error process , @xmath37 , may be additive or multiplicative , and the parameters , @xmath38 , may be spatial or time - varying .",
    "note that this model is assumed to be valid beyond the maximum data time - period ( @xmath39 ) , so that forecasting is appropriate . finally , the model is completed by the specification of distributions for the parameters in the previous stages , @xmath40[{{\\bolds{\\theta}}}_p(t)]$ ] , where we have assumed that the parameters from the two stages are independent for convenience .",
    "note , this hierarchical framework would also include a specification of the initial process distribution , @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the sequential modeling perspective is a natural framework in which to consider the da problem , as one can interpret the prior distribution from above as a forecast distribution , which gets updated given new observations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "surface winds directly transfer momentum to the ocean and surface wind speed modulates the exchanges of heat and fresh water to and from the upper ocean as modeled by bulk transfer formulae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of space - borne scatterometer instruments in the 1990s provided the first global wind fields , on daily timescales , from observations . prior to the scatterometer era , ocean winds were inferred from global weather forecast models and reanalyses ( e.g. , @xcite ) that depended upon a very sparse global network of in situ wind observations from buoys and ships of opportunity .",
    "reliable resolutions in the pre - scatterometer wind fields were limited to ocean basin scale features ( e.g. , associated with large - scale high and low pressure systems ) and monthly averages .",
    "the wind fields retrieved from scatterometer observations are not direct measures of the wind , but rather the observations are of the roughness imparted on the ocean by surface capillary waves in response to the shear stress vector at the air  sea interface .",
    "the amplitudes and orientations of surface capillary waves are in equilibrium with the surface shear stress , and these amplitudes and orientations are retrievable from measures of how the capillary waves scatter impinging radar pulses of known frequency and polarization , that is , so - called microwave backscatter cross - sections ; for details , see @xcite .",
    "radar backscatter cross - sections are spatially averaged over wind - vector cells and related to a surface vector wind ( svw ) via a geophysical model function .",
    "the svw retrievals from scatterometers are accurate to within at least 2  ms@xmath42 in speed and @xmath43 in direction .",
    "depending on the sensor system and agency providing the data , resolutions are on the order of 12.550  km for up to @xmath44 global coverage on daily timescales .",
    "the svw retrievals occur in swaths along the polar - orbitting satellite ground track .",
    "swath widths vary by system from 6001800  km , that is , between about 20 and 100 wind - vector cells across a given swath depending on resolution . because of the polar orbit ( about 14 polar orbits per day ) the swaths overlap at high latitudes and",
    "are separated by gaps in coverage at low latitudes , with the largest swath gaps occurring at the equator .",
    "again , depending on the system , the swath gaps at the equator are on the order of @xmath45 degrees longitude and can take up to three days to fill .",
    "the svw from scatterometers resolve features of the synoptic storms ( e.g. , fronts , convergences in rain bands , closed circulations , etc . )",
    "that form , propagate and dissipate every day , over the world ocean .    to fill the gaps in the scatterometer winds",
    ", one could make use of the complete ( yet lower resolution ) wind fields from the operational meteorological centers .",
    "however , these wind fields have different properties than the scatterometer observations .",
    "differences in the true resolutions of weather - center analyses and scatterometer winds are efficiently described in terms of surface wind kinetic energy spectra , that is , kinetic energy as a function of spatial wavenumber .",
    "@xcite showed a power - law relation for surface winds from multiple data sources in the tropical pacific and the power law behavior in surface winds from scatterometry has been documented for the globe @xcite .",
    "@xcite compare kinetic energy between weather center analyses and svw retrievals and find that the kinetic energy drops off unrealistically in weather center analyses at smaller scales .",
    "for example , at spatial scales on the order of @xmath46  km , the weather center kinetic energy content is more than an order of magnitude weaker than the svw observations .",
    "the goal of a statistical data assimilation is then to blend the complete , but energy - deficient , weather center analyses with the incomplete , yet energy - realistic , svw in order to provide spatially complete wind fields at sub - daily intervals while managing the uncertainties associated with the different data sources and the blending procedure .",
    "@xcite implemented a spatiotemporal bhm for tropical winds in a region of the equatorial western pacific .",
    "as noted above , the inter - swath gaps in scatterometer coverage on daily timescales are largest in the tropics .",
    "a bhm formulation to blend weather - center analyses and scatterometerwinds requires space  time properties that account for the greater intermittency in the scatterometer data .",
    "this is achieved in the process model stage in @xcite , which is posed in terms of three scientifically - motivated components as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a vector of spatially - indexed zonal ( east  west ) wind velocity components ( typically denoted by  @xmath49 ) .",
    "analogous terms apply for the meridional velocity ( @xmath50 ) . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the mean zonal wind process that accounts for the prevailing wind and its variance in the tropical domain , @xmath52 is a basis function matrix corresponding to the large - scale modes of the equatorial beta - plane approximation ( i.e. , a linear , thin fluid approximation ) to the momentum equations , and @xmath53 are nested wavelet basis functions used to model fine - scale winds according to observed kinetic energy - wavenumber properties for the region .",
    "the use of scientifically - motivated basis functions is crucial here , as we have information from the thin - fluid analytical approximation to the wind field that is appropriate over the tropics . in particular , the leading equatorial normal modes [ @xmath54 are large - scale wave signals in the tropics , that is , westward propagating rossby waves , eastward kelvin waves and mixed rossby  gravity waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on data analyses ( e.g.,@xcite ) , the equatorial normal mode basis functions were limited to the leading modes defined by two zonal wavenumbers and four wavenumbers in the meridional direction @xcite .",
    "these are sufficient to support the important basin - scale kelvin , rossby and mixed rossby  gravity waves that can be used to describe much of the tropical dynamics within the pacific basin .",
    "the amplitude coefficients , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are treated as random variables in the bhm , with first - order markov models .",
    "the priors on the parameters associated with these models correspond to time series of the theoretical amplitudes for each mode for the @xmath55 coefficients and the slopes of the kinetic energy spectrum for the @xmath56 coefficients as obtained from @xcite .",
    "data stage inputs were obtained from nscat svw retrievals and from sea level pressure and surface winds taken from reanalyses of the national centers for environmental protection ( ncep ) .",
    "the posterior mean surface wind and surface convergence / divergence exhibited variability on scales not achievable in the ncep reanalyses .",
    "this is particularly evident in a comparison of the ncep reanalysis wind field with the posterior mean winds from the tropical wind bhm for the period when tropical cyclone dale crossed the study area ( figure  [ 2paneltrop ] ) .",
    "the posterior mean winds are organized into strong convergence regions that spiral into the center of the tropical cyclone .",
    "these are consistent with rain band features of tropical cyclones and this was confirmed by comparing the posterior mean winds with cloud - top temperatures from an independent satellite observation nearly coincident with the snapshot from the posterior distribution of the bhm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "uncertainty management properties of svw bhm based on mechanisitic models ( i.e. , leading order terms and/or approximations of the primitive equations ) are particularly relevant in ocean forecast settings .",
    "the mediterranean forecast system ( mfs ) is an operational system producing 10-day forecasts for upper ocean fields every day .",
    "the mfs ocean forecast models resolve synoptic variability in the upper ocean .",
    "the uncertain parts of the forecast fields are at ocean mesoscales , that is , hourly and 1050  km scales .",
    "these are the scales of upper ocean hydrodynamic instabilities driven by the surface wind .",
    "so , modeling uncertainty in the surface wind field is a useful means of quantifying uncertainty in the mfs ocean forecasts on the scales that are most important to daily users .",
    "@xcite describe the details of the svw bhm for mfs , and @xcite review the impacts of bhm svw fields in an ensemble forecast methodology built around realizations from the posterior distribution for svw from the bhm .",
    "the mechanistic process model in @xcite involves the leading - order terms in a rayleigh friction equation approximation at synoptic scales and , again , a  nested wavelet basis model to represent turbulent closure at the finest spatial scales .",
    "thus , again it is critical to incorporate scientific information into the specification of the process rather than try to model such behavior through the marginal covariance structure .",
    "this then also allows specification of the measurement uncertainties associated with the data conditioned upon the true process .",
    "specifically , data stage inputs are obtained from the quikscat scatterometer svw retrievals and from weather center sea level pressure and surface wind fields .",
    "ten realizations of the posterior distribution for svw were used to drive ensemble data assimilation and ensemble forecasts in the mfs .",
    "figure  [ 2panelmed ] depicts the data assimilation system response in sea - surface height ( ssh ) at the forecast initial condition time .",
    "the mean ssh initial condition ( figure  [ 2panelmed ] , top ) reflects the accurate spatial scales for mfs forecasts where synoptic variability overlies the general circulation patterns for the mediterranean sea .",
    "sub - basin scale cyclonic gyres are represented by blue ( depressed ) ssh and anticyclones by reds .",
    "the gradients between blue and red signals are proportional to surface current speeds .",
    "the spread in the ssh initial condition ( figure  [ 2panelmed ] , bottom ) demonstrates the value of managing uncertainty in the svw .",
    "the largest amplitude signals in the spread are localized in a few places only  where surface wind is driving hydrodynamic instabilities and pulsing the energy in ocean mesoscale response .",
    "inferring the structure of the circulation in the world s oceans is a significant part of our quest for understanding the climate .",
    "direct measurements of the circulation are difficult to obtain ; however , in the past decades , scientists have collected large amounts of hydrographic data ( hydrostatic pressure , temperature , salinity , oxygen concentration , etc . ) .",
    "such data have been used to produce climatological maps that exhibit the large scale structure ( lozier , owens and curry @xcite ) . based on these maps and data , one can infer some constituents of the ocean circulation , such as boundary currents , wind - driven gyres and abyssal interior flow .",
    "yet , hydrographic data are typically available at very sparse locations in space and time .",
    "for example , the world ocean circulation experiment lasted from 1990 until 1998 . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we illustrate these data that were available for the south atlantic ocean .",
    "consequently , statistical smoothing methods are required to provide estimates at space ",
    "time locations of interest . to that end",
    ", one would typically combine data sets collected at different times .",
    "this seems reasonable only under the assumption that the distribution of dynamically - passive tracers is representative of a mean circulation and that such tracers are sufficiently stable on a fixed neutral density layer .",
    "a classical approach to inverting hydrographic data into circulation structure is the _ box inverse method _",
    "starting with the thermal wind equations , the problem reduces to estimation of a reference velocity field .",
    "this is achieved via a large system of linear equations expressing conservation of mass within a collection of connected boxes . due to the size of the problem ,",
    "a high - dimensional regression approach is subsequently employed .",
    "traditionally , ridge regression estimators have proved useful , however , modern statistical / machine learning methods can provide more effective alternatives .",
    "other approaches are based on more complex inverse modeling and nonlinear optimization ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inverse problem described here is ill - posed and some type of regularization is required @xcite .",
    "we describe the bayesian inversion approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which connects the data ( tracer concentrations ) to parameters ( ocean circulation ) using a  system of partial differential equations . in this case",
    ", regularization is imposed through a prior distribution over the parameters .",
    "the _ solution _ is the posterior distribution .",
    "it can be used to select `` representative '' values and the associated uncertainty for any aspect of the circulation .",
    "formally , let @xmath57 denote the concentration of a tracer of interest at a location @xmath58 in a rectangular domain @xmath59 representing the layer of the ocean being studied .",
    "the problem is to estimate the ( horizontal ) water velocities and diffusion coefficients based on noisy measurements of @xmath60 at a sparse set of locations in @xmath61 . in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we display an interpolated map of oxygen concentration for a @xmath62  m deep layer in the south atlantic ocean .",
    "the connection between the tracer concentration @xmath60 and the velocities and diffusion coefficients is modeled by the steady - state advection - diffusion equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the horizontal water velocity , the diagonal diffusivity matrix @xmath65 does not vary with location , and the sink term @xmath66 is present only when @xmath60 represents oxygen concentration . equation ( [ ad ] ) is augmented with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath67 when @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the boundary of @xmath61 .",
    "the statistical model assumes additive observational error @xmath70 here , @xmath71 indexes a particular tracer and @xmath72 indexes a spatial location where data for tracer @xmath73 are available .",
    "the underlying tracer concentration @xmath74 is obtained as a solution of the advection diffusion equation ( [ ad ] ) . as this solution is not available in closed form ,",
    "one uses a numerical ( grid - based ) approximation .",
    "we collect all quantities of interest ( velocities , diffusion coefficients , boundary values ) in a high - dimensional vector @xmath75 . under the that the measurement errors @xmath76 are unbiased gaussian variables with constant ( yet tracer - dependent ) variance , the posterior distribution is written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the selected prior distribution . the posterior probability model ( [ post0 ] )",
    "is explored via monte carlo methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ill - posedness mentioned above is resolved by specifying a proper prior distribution @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that the posterior distribution is proper .",
    "however , an efficient mcmc approach is still required .",
    "in addition , one can design specific sampling strategies as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand that each component described above ( physical model , prior distribution , likelihood function , data ) plays a crucial role in determining the solution . under the bayesian approach , a sensitivity analysis , although possible , is hampered by the immense computational cost associated with the mcmc sampler .",
    "in addition ,",
    "the under - determination problem is present in this case",
    ". there are(roughly ) 300 data points , while there are thousands of parameters to estimate ( velocities , diffusions , boundary values ) . in the results given in @xcite and @xcite , not all estimated velocities are significantly different from zero , which is the prior mean . however , the data are informative about the large - scale features ( zonal jets , gyres ) .",
    "the posterior mean velocities are compared with velocities determined from float data @xcite , showing a comforting consistency ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "tropical pacific sst exhibits some of the most important variability on inter - annual time scales for the ocean / atmosphere system ( e.g. , see the overview in @xcite ) .",
    "this variation arises from complicated interactions , across a large range of spatiotemporal scales , between the ocean and the atmosphere .",
    "the most prominent signal on these time scales is the el nio - southern oscillation ( enso ) phenomenon .",
    "this is the well - known quasi - periodic ( 35 year period ) warming ( el nio ) and cooling ( la nia ) in the tropical pacific .",
    "these warming and cooling events lead to dramatic effects in weather across the globe due to teleconnections with the global atmospheric circulation . because of these significant weather related impacts ( e.g. , droughts , floods , etc . ) , it is critical to be able to forecast several months in advance the possible development and transition of these events . increasingly , such``long lead '' forecasts have shown useful skill and correspond to one of the few situations in ocean science where a purely statistical forecast methodology is competitive with , and in many cases better than , equivalent deterministic model forecasts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    at typical spatial resolutions",
    ", there can easily be several thousand gridded spatial locations corre - sponding to the tropical pacific region of forecasting interest .",
    "complicated spatiotemporal statistical models are difficult or impossible to implement at these dimensions .",
    "for this reason , statistically - based models for tropical sst have been `` spectral '' in the sense that they are based on coefficients associated with a projection of the sst fields on spatial basis functions .",
    "the associated projection coefficients that are evolved are typically a reduced set , usually corresponding to larger modes .",
    "that is , let @xmath48 correspond to an @xmath79-dimensional vector of the true sst process at @xmath79 spatial locations and time @xmath30 and consider the decomposition of this process vector @xmath80 where @xmath81 , is an @xmath82 matrix of spatial basis functions , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the associated expansion coefficients .",
    "a first - order linear markov assumption on the evolution of the coefficients @xmath83 , for example , @xmath85 , for appropriate time increment , @xmath86 , and with gaussian errors , @xmath87 , was shown in the early 1990s to be a model with reasonable skill at long - lead forecasting ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as with the tropical wind case presented previously , the specification of the process in terms of two basis sets is critical from a scientific perspective . in particular , it is thought that the active dynamical process is driven by a lower dimensional manifold ( corresponding to the first set of basis functions ) and , yet , the residual spatially - dependent structures captured by the second set of basis functions remain an important source of variability .",
    "although dimension - reduced linear markov models showed reasonable skill , the enso phenomenon is better characterized as a nonlinear process ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nonlinear statistical models typically are better at capturing the magnitude of the predicted el nio and la nia events ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most nonlinear stochastic methods have not successfully characterized the uncertainty in the forecasts .",
    "an exception to this is the model of @xcite , who use a dimension - reduced threshold markov model with certain components governed by the onset of intra - seasonal oscillations ( so - called `` westerly wind bursts '' ) .",
    "there are several key components of the model in @xcite that illustrate the power of hierarchical modeling .",
    "first , the data model is constructed @xmath88 where the data vector , @xmath89 , is very high - dimensional ( say , @xmath90 ) , and @xmath52 is a reduced - dimension set of spatial basis functions as described above ( an @xmath91 matrix ) .",
    "it is important to note that the remaining basis functions ( e.g. , @xmath53 from above ) associated with the basis expansion are used to parameterize the observational spatial covariance matrix , @xmath92 , which now accounts for both observation error and the truncation .",
    "the assumption is that the active dynamics exist on the lower dimensional manifold represented by @xmath52 and , like in typical turbulence parameterizations , the small scale structures accounted for by the @xmath53 portion of the expansion are associated with nonpredictive covariability .    critically , the evolution of the dynamical process is nonlinear , but conditionally linear .",
    "specifically , @xmath93 where prior distributions are also specified for @xmath94 . the important modeling assumption is that @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on both the current ( time @xmath30 ) and future ( time @xmath97 ) climate `` regimes , '' that is , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 classifies the current sst regime as `` cool , '' `` normal '' or `` warm , '' and @xmath101 anticipates one of these three regimes at time @xmath97 .",
    "specifically , @xmath100 is based on the southern oscillation index and @xmath101 is based on a latent variable that is modeled , hierarchically , in terms of the east - west component of the near surface wind in the western pacific ocean ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that this leads to nine potential mean states and nine potential dynamical operators , accommodating the nonlinear transition between enso phases .",
    "because this model was developed in a bayesian hierarchical framework , it was able to capture the uncertainty characterized by the data , process and parameters .",
    "however , despite the fact that this model used physical notions ( i.e. , westerly wind bursts ) in the lower stages of the model hierarchy , it was unable to directly account for quadratic interactions across spatial scales . as mentioned previously , nonlinearity is important in most atmosphere and ocean processes .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the effectiveness of a quadratic nonlinear model for long - lead prediction of enso from a classical regression perspective .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the implementation of a quadratic nonlinear model in the context of a bayesian hierarchical framework in which the random nonlinear process is `` hidden '' and parameters are random as well .",
    "they illustrate that simple arguments from turbulence scaling support the form of this model and further suggest a dimension reduction strategy .    as defined in @xcite , general quadratic nonlinearity ( gqn ) with respect to the @xmath83 process",
    "can be written @xmath102 for @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is some transformation of @xmath105 that depends on parameters @xmath106 and gives the process more generality than the simple dyadic interactions alone .",
    "this framework is exceptionally flexible in accommodating many real - world mechanistic processes , but it comes at the cost of a curse of dimensionality in the parameter space ; that is , there are @xmath107 parameters corresponding to the nonlinear coefficients ( @xmath108 ) , in addition to the linear coefficients ( @xmath109 ) and  @xmath106 .",
    "one can use scale analysis to help with the dimensionality concerns , and also to motivate components of the hierarchical model . specifically , as before , assume we can decompose the spectral coefficients into large - scale components ( @xmath83 ) and small - scale coefficients ( @xmath84 ) corresponding to the spatial basis functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 discussed above . consider all of the possible dyadic interactions of the elements of this vector  that is , there are small - scale / small - scale , small - scale / large - scale and large - scale / large - scale interactions .",
    "loosely motivated by `` reynolds averaging '' in turbulence theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite suggest considering the large - scale / large - scale pairwise interactions explicitly , with the small - scale / small - scale interactions contributing to a correlated structure in the additive error , and the small - scale / large - scale interactions corresponding to the linear term in the large - scale coefficients with random parameters ( i.e. , the small - scale coefficients play the role of random coefficients in the ) .",
    "such an argument leads to a quadratic nonlinear model on the large - scale coefficients , which can be written in matrix form as @xmath110 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{{{\\bolds{\\eta}}}_t \\sim \\operatorname{gau}({{\\mathbf{0}}},{{\\mathbf{q}}}).}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] prior distributions are then given to the parameters in @xmath111 and @xmath112 as well as the covariance matrix @xmath113 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was shown to quite reasonably account for the uncertainties so that the prediction error bounds covered the extreme enso events , even when the forecasts did not adequately capture the true magnitude .",
    "critically , these quadratic nonlinear implementations still suffer from a fairly high curse of dimensionality in the parameters . in this sense",
    ", various model reduction approaches have to be implemented that necessarily fail to account for as much model uncertainty as is likely present .",
    "it is difficult to know a priori which quadratic interactions are important . to alleviate this curse of dimensionality and to provide a natural framework in which to `` average '' across the various model specifications",
    ", @xcite employed a stochastic search variable selection methodology ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in general ,",
    "although the gqn statistical models are very flexible in representing oceanographic processes , these models can easily experience finite - time blow up ( i.e. , explosive growth ) when fit to data @xcite .",
    "this is seldom an issue when one is using these models for data assimilation , given the presence of observations to act as a control ( e.g. , @xcite ) , nor is it typically a problem when one is only forecasting out one time step ( e.g. , as in the sst example ) .",
    "it can be a problem when multiple time steps are forecast that require some form of constraint , either statistical or physical @xcite .",
    "analysis of marine ecosystem dynamics involves various sources of uncertainty in the observations , the underlying scientific process and the parameters that describe the process dynamics .",
    "critically , it is often the case that the observation errors are non - gaussian and that the process being modeled is nonlinear , that is , there is an explicit system of coupled nonlinear differential equations that describe the complex ecosystem dynamics . as a result of these uncertainties and complexities ,",
    "the bhm framework is natural , but can be difficult to implement .",
    "soon after the introduction of mcmc methods into bayesian computation , the bhm approach was used in data assimilation for marine ecosystem models . anticipating the forthcoming increase in re",
    "- motely - sensed ocean color observations , @xcite implemented an mcmc - based sampling protocol that explored the ability to recover various model parameters in a seven - compartment marine ecosystem model with and without added model noise .",
    "they noted the computational difficulties required to adequately account for correlation in these parameters . while identifying correlation in only ten parameters",
    "may no longer be a computational issue , there are still issues related to the sampling methodology that adequately generates reasonable block proposals for the entire parameter vector . adaptive metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithms , which update the covariance of the proposal distribution , may be useful when trying to generate adequate proposals for a nonlinear marine ecosystem model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "current research has taken into account advances in sampling methodology , including the following : sequential importance resampling , particle filters , ensemble kalman filters and state - augmentation approaches ( @xcite , @xcite;@xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an innovative practice in statistical modeling of ocean ecosystems is the inclusion of information from deterministic , mechanistic models into the statistical framework , typically in the process stage of a bhm .",
    "however , the necessary estimation procedures often require iteratively running the mechanistic model , which poses a problem when the model is computationally expensive and can only be run a very limited number of times . in certain situations where the computer model is too computationally expensive to run a sufficient number of times for the desired analysis ,",
    "statistical surrogates ( i.e. , emulators ) are used . in its simplest form ,",
    "an emulator is simply the resulting estimated statistical model when computer model output is used as data .",
    "then , this model is used to predict the output of the computer model under untried input settings ( e.g. , initial conditions , parameter values , forcings ) .",
    "traditionally , so - called `` computer model '' emulation has been done using gaussian process ( gp ) models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our case , these `` computer models '' are deterministic ocean forward models .",
    "gp emulators are related to spatial gps , which use a correlation function such that the model output is more highly correlated for inputs that are `` nearer '' to one another in a given sense than those that are `` farther apart . ''",
    "however , because ocean ecosystem models are nonlinear , a gp emulator of the joint distribution of the output may be inappropriate ( as a nonlinear process can not be specified by only two moments ) . in this case",
    ", one could consider the use of a dynamic gp emulator , which considers the value of the process at the current time step ( i.e. , the initial conditions ) as an input to the ocean forward model ( and gp emulator ) .",
    "this offers several benefits over the traditional gp emulation approach ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    rather than modeling the dynamics through a covariance function in a gp",
    ", it may be more appropriate to model the output using first - order characteristics ( as the computer models themselves are written ) .",
    "the use of so - called `` first - order emulators '' has appeared in several applications , for example , @xcite and @xcite use neural networks and @xcite use random forests , a  machine learning algorithm .",
    "there is also the potential to use other nonlinear statistical models , polynomial chaos expansions ( mattern , fennel and dowd , @xcite ) or gp models in a dynamical context @xcite .",
    "these approaches use dimension - reduction techniques to overcome the curse of dimensionality , with the emulator describing the dynamics of the reduced - dimensional process .",
    "most of these implementations use nonparametric approaches . alternatively , @xcite use an emulator based on a reduced - rank multivariate quadratic nonlinear statistical model as described above .    related to the use of emulators for dynamic models",
    ", there is also a growing body of work considering the use of emulators for spatial or spatiotemporal forward model output .",
    "marine ecosystem models can vary from nonspatial , 0-d models , to models that have spatial structure .",
    "@xcite used a 1-d ( in the vertical ) four - component model that included nutrients , zooplankton , phytoplankton and detritus ( e.g. , a `` 1-d nzpd '' model ) with iron limitation ( i.e. , `` 1-d npzdfe '' ) to model a process by creating a forest of 1-d models ( more specifically , a forest of emulators of the 1-d model ) .",
    "these 1-d models resolve vertical processes , but do not account for horizontal diffusion and advection .",
    "variability resulting from horizontal advection and diffusion is accommodated by putting a spatial gp model on the parameters ( inputs ) to the 1-dnpzdfe model .    in certain circumstances ,",
    "the forward model emulator is developed simply to learn about the behavior of the forward model itself .",
    "however , in other situations , the forward model emulator may be useful in a data assimilation context . in those circumstances ,",
    "the emulator may be used in a two - stage approach , where the emulator is fit `` off - line , '' and then is used inside a bayesian hierarchical model in the place of the forward model itself . @xcite and @xcite developed bhms using forward model output as data .",
    "@xcite performed data assimilation using seawifs ocean color observations , as well as sea surface height and sst output from the regional ocean model system ( roms ) forward model coupled with the npzdfe model ( @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite show that this approach was sufficient to accommodate nonlinear dynamics even in the absence of observations over a substantial portion of the domain as shown in figure  [ fig.bio ] .",
    "space limitations prevent us from giving complete overviews of all hierarchical statistical models inoceanography .",
    "however , we mention here some notable and important papers that have been published in recent years in areas outside of those mentioned above . by necessity , this list is not exhaustive , neither in terms of topics nor citations within topics , but it does give some sense of the breadth and depth of work being done in the area .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the amount of in situ data for ocean state variables is fairly limited and there is a need to construct complete spatial fields representing climatological features of the ocean state , as well as the uncertainty in those states using spatial and spatiotemporal models .",
    "there are many notable examples from a bhm perspective ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; lemosand sans , @xcite ; @xcite(@xcite ) ) .",
    "it has long been known that there are strong teleconnections between the ocean and the atmosphere and this has led to useful statistical models for prediction ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is an increasingly large number of papers that have used the bhm perspective to model teleconnections as well as their impacts .",
    "for example , @xcite used such a model when evaluating the impacts of sst on tornado report counts in the eastern two - thirds of the us ; @xcite ( and references therein ) have shown great success in modeling hurricane activity and forecasts ( see also @xcite ) ; @xcite use a bhm to model precipitation considering ocean conditions .",
    "in addition , there are recent studies showing linkages between the physical ocean and ecological impacts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bayesian hierarchical models have long been used to model the higher trophic levels of the marine ecosystem .",
    "for example , stock - recruitment models have been an important tool in marine fisheries management ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite(@xcite ) ; @xcite ; @xcite(@xcite ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , bhms have been used extensively in recent years to model distributions and movement of marine mammals ( e.g. , @xcite ; ver  hoef andjansen ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    clearly , a critical problem of vast societal interest concerns climate change . given the role of the ocean in the climate system and",
    "its direct connections to weather events and ecological impacts , oceanic climate change and its uncertainty characterization are extremely important .",
    "this is a vast research area with many papers that have taken a hierarchical bayesian approach .",
    "this topic is beyond the scope of this review , but a few notable examples include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated throughout this review , the ocean system is quite complex with numerous interacting subcomponents and external processes , and with substantial uncertainty in terms of knowledge and data .",
    "statistical methods have been critically important to improve our understanding of this system and to characterize uncertainty . in recent years",
    ", the hierarchical statistical modeling paradigm has proven to be an exceptionally useful tool to manage the various sources of uncertainty .",
    "we have only just scratched the surface in terms of our presentation of the work that has been done in this area , but it is clear that the use of hierarchical modeling in oceanography has blossomed .",
    "that being said , in addition to continued development in the areas mentioned above , there are still many important problems at the interface of statistics and oceanography to be considered and methodologies to be explored .",
    "one of the biggest challenges for statisticians working in oceanography is to develop statistical models that can effectively parameterize the complex nonlinear interactions that are associated with the ocean system .",
    "in particular , models must be developed to account for potentially high - dimensional state - processes , and yet effectively manage uncertainty with varying data quality and non - gaussian errors . in general , to be effective in this context , dimension reduction should not be independent of the physical and biological environment of the problem under consideration .    one component of nonlinearity that is important concerns the coupling of subsystems , whether that be the atmosphere / ocean interface , the ocean / ice interface , the physical / biological interface or interactions between trophic levels in the ocean .",
    "many of these couplings require parameterizations for fluxes across boundaries , and there is often only limited observational data available to help inform the process .",
    "this presents an extreme challenge and one in which we must use the large amounts of remotely sensed observations along with the sparse in situ data to build these nonlinear relationships .    not unrelated is the notion of accounting for and describing model error .",
    "the precise characterization of uncertainty that is fundamental in bhm can be used to help identify and characterize model error in deterministic models of the ocean system , for example , ocean forecast models . as with all model abstractions ,",
    "deterministic approaches accept trade - offs in resolution and approximations of the ocean variability to gain affordability in simulations and forecasts . because the ocean system and the models are inherently nonlinear , the errors introduced by acceptable approximations can grow and lead to model error properties that are difficult to diagnose .",
    "parameters of posterior distributions from independent bhm analyses for ocean model response or control variables can be used as a standard against which deterministic model error can be quantified .",
    "for example , if the incremental adjustment of the surface momentum flux control vector in a variational data assimilation procedure pushes the momentum flux at a point outside the reasonable bounds of a posterior distribution for momentum flux from a bhm , the variational procedure is probably compensating for forecast model error as opposed to uncertainty in the control vector .    to gain understanding of",
    "the impact of physical processes on biota as well as the interaction of biological organisms , there is increasing reliance on individual ( or agent - based ) models .",
    "these models have become more prevalent in the ecological realm and are starting to be considered from the bhm perspective ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the use of these models in a statistical context across the spectrum of scales and processes involved in oceanography is a growing area of interest . for example , @xcite link physical ocean models to individual - based bioenergetic models for fish .",
    "the issues described above will almost certainly require new computational strategies , particularly in the bayesian paradigm .",
    "as the models get more and more complex and larger data sets become available , standard mcmc methods begin to fail to provide meaningful results . among the many challenges associated with bayesian computing , two",
    "stand out : ( 1 ) there are very high - dimensional distributions to be explored , and ( 2 ) the models are complex , which leads to inexact and sometimes impossible likelihood evaluations .",
    "novel mcmc methodology will address these issues , while maintaining feasibility .",
    "for example , particle mcmc ( pmcmc ) methods are designed to address the first issue . for high - dimensional posterior distributions ( thousands ofstate variables and parameters ) , it is nearly impossible to design good metropolis ",
    "hastings proposal distributions and in this case , even adaptive mcmc may fail .",
    "@xcite propose to use sequential monte carlo ( smc ) methods combined with importance sampling to design near optimal proposal distributions .",
    "the resulting algorithm , which has similar features to a particle filter , will update the entire collection of state variables at once and can be extremely useful for space  time models . @xcite",
    "use pmcmc for state and parameter estimation as well as state forecasting in the context of a marine biogeochemical model .",
    "in addition , hamiltonian mcmc methodologies may provide an attractive alternative for situations for which samples from complicated high - dimensional processes and parameter distributions are required ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "approximate bayes computing ( abc ) methods are a new and emerging class of likelihood - freemcmc algorithms .",
    "they address the second issue above  that is , cases when evaluation of the likelihood function involves integrals over very large spaces that are impossible to calculate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "abc relies on the ability to simulate from the selected model without much computing effort .",
    "consequently , the user is forced to select a relevant ( multivariate ) statistic and `` posterior samples '' are defined as parameter values that result in a statistic similar to the one observed .",
    "this algorithm , in fact , explores the distribution of the variables of interest _",
    "conditional on the selected statistic _",
    ", not the data .",
    "although this may raise some concern regarding the interpretation of the results , @xcite describe a semi - automatic way of selecting good summary statistics in a general setting .    in general",
    ", it seems likely that for inference and prediction of complicated oceanographic processes in the foreseeable future , one will have to continue to make compromises between model complexity and computational feasibility .",
    "indeed , one must be willing to accept some reasonable lack of `` optimality '' in the solution in order to make headway on many of these problems .",
    "this is true regardless of whether one takes a bayesian or frequentist perspective .",
    "the hierarchical paradigm helps to some extent as it allows one to consider trade - offs between approximate computational strategies , incorporation of scientific information and model specification for the different model components ( data , process and parameters ) separately .    in conclusion",
    ", there is a long history of activity at the interface of statistics and oceanography . in recent years",
    ", the hierarchical statistical paradigm has proven to be very helpful for managing the uncertainty associated with data , process and parameters in modeling the ocean and its related systems .",
    "there are increasingly more oceanographers with advanced statistical training and more statisticians with oceanographic backgrounds and this is sure to lead to even more innovative and exciting methodological developments in years to come .",
