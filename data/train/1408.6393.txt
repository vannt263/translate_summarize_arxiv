    "in contrast , if you slowly pull the lower string downward , only the upper string breaks , and the weight falls off .",
    "these two contrasting observations , in other words a  pull - or - jerk \" experiment , originate from the inertia of the suspended weight ; the inertia of the weight prevents the upper string from breaking when the lower string is jerked .",

    "in contrast , a slow pull will break only the upper string because of the non - equivalence in the tensions between the two strings .",
    "the tension in the upper string is a sum of the restoring force plus the gravitational force on the weight , while the tension in the lower string is only equals the restoring force .",

    "using stretchable strings make what we observe richer .",
    "as such , no matter how slowly or quickly we pull the lower string , the elastic properties of the two strings will cause an oscillatory motion of the weight along the vertical direction .",
    "the oscillation then induces a time modulation in the tensions of the two strings . as a consequence ,",
    "the problem is beyond a two - alternative choice , i.e. , either a jerk or slow pull .",
    "depending on the pulling speed and elastic properties of the strings , how each string breaks may vary .",
    "thus , we are required to analytically solve the equation of motion and derive the time - variation in the tensions , which will provide a good gedanken - experiment and facilitate a student s understanding of mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , there have only been a few attempts at solving the problem in a quantitative manner @xcite .",
    "this contribution provides an analytic description of the pull - or - jerk experiment by solving the equation of motion of the system .",
    "the analysis is based on the assumption that the bottom edge of the lower string moves linearly downward with time ; this constant - pulling - speed condition is different from the existing studies , in which the pulling force acting on the bottom of the lower string varies linearly @xcite or sinusoidally @xcite with time .",

    "although they have the same young s modulus value , their spring constants should be in proportion to their respective lengths .",

    "the following discussion helps us to check the feasibility of a classroom experiment for verifying our theoretical results",
    ".    the first concern will be realistic values of @xmath71 obtained in experiments . to estimate it ,",
    "suppose that we use commercially available strings : a sewing fiber made of polyester and a fishing line made of polyvinylidene fluoride , both of which we are familiar with in our daily life , are cases in point .",
    "these strings are typically endowed with the maximum strength , @xmath7 , of a few tens newtons ( n ) .",
    "for instance , the author has found a sewing thread with @xmath119 n and a fishing line of @xmath120 n in a diy store nearby .",
    "this indicates that , if we use a weight of mass @xmath121 g in the experiment , we have @xmath122 for the sewing thread and @xmath123 for the fishing line .",
    "these values of @xmath71 are comparable to those we have considered in theoretical discussion ( see figs .",
    "[ fig04 ] and [ fig05 ] ) .",
    "another concern should be the realistic value of @xmath26 , which can be explored by considering the spring constant , @xmath124 , of the strings used in the experiment .",
    "although the value of @xmath124 depends on the natural lengths of the strings , we can estimate it as a few hundreds newtons per meter ( n / m ) if the length of one meter or less is assumed .",
    "in fact , the author has confirmed using a simple balance that the sewing thread of 50 cm in length has the spring constants of @xmath125 n / m and the fishing line of 1 m has @xmath126 n / m .",
    "therefore , if we set up the pulling speed of @xmath127 m / s and the weight of mass @xmath121 g , we obtain @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the sewing - thread - based apparatus and the fishing - line - based apparatus , respectively .",
    "what s more , since the value of @xmath124 can be tuned by changing the string s length , we can cover a wide range of @xmath26 that has been considered in our theoretical discussion    the final point to be noted is how to realize a constant - pulling - speed condition .",
    "one idea is to use a rotating wheel driven by a gear motor with a few rpm ( rotations per minute ) .",
    "suppose that the bottom end of the lower string is attached to the wheel and its rotational axis is fixed horizontally .",
    "then , constant rate rotation of the wheel results in a desired downward pulling with constant rate . another possible way is to use a freely rotating wheel made of steel , for example , that posesses a large moment of inertia around the rotation axis .",
    "the latter way requires to install a velocity sensor and a force sensor with the apparatus to measure the wheel s rotation speed and the string s tension , respectively . in either case",
    ", inexpensive and small size devices will suffice to build the experimental equipment .",
    "we have theoretically described the well - known inertia demonstration based on a weight and two strings . under a constant - pulling - speed condition ,",
    "we have derived a closed - form expression for the critical pulling speed at a given maximum tension . a phase diagram illustrating which string",
    "will break has also been established .",
    "the author thinks that it is pedagogical to follow the present argument and compare it with those obtained under other pulling conditions @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to propose the following questions for further work related to this thesis .    *",
    "consider an upside - down situation ; where you pick up the top of a string that hangs a weight , and a similar string connects the bottom of the weight and floor .",
    "can you derive a closed - form expression for the critical speed of upward pulling ?",
    "what phase diagram do you obtain ? * what occurs if you lay down the apparatus on a friction - free floor ? in the system , the left - hand edge of the string left to the weight is fixed to a sidewall , and the right - hand edge of the string right to the weight is what you are pulling horizontally .",
    "gravitational force on the weigh no longer contributes in this case . *",
    "carry out a study similar to this article for a one - dimensional chain of many weights , in which the weights and strings are arranged alternately in the vertical direction from above to bottom . when pulling downward the bottom of the lowest string with a constant speed , is it possible for all the strings to break simultaneously ?",
    "you can start a double - weight system as the simplest example .",
