    "the coordinate of the configuration space of @xmath4 branch points on @xmath5 gives a modular function for @xmath6 via the period mapping of the family of the corresponding elliptic curves .",

    "they showed an interesting relation between the arrangement of @xmath7 lines on the projective plane @xmath8 and the modular functions on a @xmath4 dimensional bounded symmetric space of type @xmath9 via the period mapping of the family of @xmath10 surfaces coming from the arrangement of @xmath7 lines .",
    "we shall give another natural extension of the classical elliptic integrals to a case of several variables .",
    "the hilbert modular functions for real quadratic fields are very popular among modular functions of several variables . however , to the best of the author s knowledge , to obtain simple and geometric extensions of the classical elliptic integrals to the hilbert modular cases is a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "although the hilbert modular functions with level @xmath11 structure can be obtained from the moduli of hyperelliptic curves of genus @xmath11 , they are characterized by a complicated modular equations ( see remark [ humbertremark ] ) .    in this paper , we focus on the hilbert modular functions for @xmath0 . since the real quadratic field @xmath0 gives the smallest discriminant , several researchers ( for example , k. b. gundlach @xcite , f. hirzebruch @xcite , r. mller @xcite ) studied this case in detail .",
    "we shall give a simple and geometric interpretation of the hilbert modular functions in this case .",
    "we consider the double integrals of the algebraic function @xmath12 in ( [ alg.f ] ) of @xmath11 variables on chambers surrounded by the parabola @xmath13 in ( [ p ] ) and the quintic curve @xmath14 in ( [ q ] ) with the @xmath15-cusp .",
    "these double integrals are equal to the period integrals of the kummer surface @xmath16 in ( [ k(x , y ) ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ k(x , y ) ] ) gives a double covering of the weighted projective plane @xmath2 branched along @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the complex parameters @xmath17 determine the arrangement of the branch loci .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 are regarded as a pair of the hilbert modular functions for @xmath0 via the explicit double integrals ( see remark [ stok ] and theorem [ doubleintegralthm ] ) .",
    "our results are coherent with the story of the classical elliptic integrals ( see table 1 ) .",
