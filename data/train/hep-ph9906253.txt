    "one of the basic questions in high energy physics is : are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ? in the absence of right - handed currents , it is virtually impossible to discern the nature of the light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , if heavy neutrinos ( @xmath12 gev ) exist , then present and , even more so , future experiments could establish whether such neutrinos are majorana or dirac .",
    "many theoretical investigations have been carried out @xcite into the production cross sections of heavy majorana neutrinos ( @xmath0 s ) as predicted by various models , via @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions , and mostly within specific models or classes of models . as a rule , it has been assumed that the center - of - mass ( cms ) energy @xmath15 in the process is high enough for the production of _ on - shell _ ( os ) heavy @xmath0 s ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "further , the effects of the _ off - shell _ ( nos ) @xmath0 s have been ignored .",
    "we note that the detection of @xmath17 pair production events can be realized by identifying the final decay products ( on - shell ) of the majorana neutrinos ",
    "primarily the leptons @xmath18 s and the @xmath19 s .",
    "thus , the reactions @xmath20 , which violate the total lepton number , would be a clear signal of the majorana character of the intermediate neutrinos ( the latter need not be on - shell ) .",
    "here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two initial leptons , either @xmath2 or @xmath1 .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated the importance of taking into account the contributions of _ off - shell _ intermediate @xmath0 s in such processes , in @xmath2 colliders such as lep200 and future linear colliders .",
    "several advantages of @xmath1 colliders were pointed out by the authors of @xcite . in the present paper , we present some results of calculations for the afore - mentioned reactions for @xmath1 colliders .",
    "the main advantages of the @xmath1 colliders , in contrast to the @xmath2 colliders , from our perspective , are the following :    * @xmath23 s can easily be accelerated to very high energies due to reduced synchrotron radiation loss ( since @xmath24 ) ; * the @xmath4 channel ( @xmath3-mediated ) is not present now .    due to the first point",
    ", the event rates can be increased because of the increased center - of - mass ( cms ) energy @xmath15 of the process . due to the second point ,",
    "the number of parameters on which the production rate depends is reduced since only the couplings of @xmath0 s to charged currents contribute ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings ) .",
    "the second point does not apply in the case of @xmath27 colliders , the case which we therefore do not consider in the present paper .    as in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "our analysis is rather general , in the sense that we do not restrict ourselves to any specific ( classes of ) models .",
    "further , we use basically the same set of programs developed by us there , this time adjusted to the case of @xmath1 colliders .",
    "we stress that , in contrast to the available literature , our numerical calculations include the effects of _ off - shell _ ( nos ) intermediate @xmath0 s on the cross sections .",
    "this enables us to investigate deviations from the previously known cross sections ( with two on - shell intermediate @xmath0 s ) , in the `` 2os '' kinematic region ( @xmath28 ) where both intermediate @xmath0 s can , but need not , be on shell ( os )  these deviations are often referred to as `` finite width effects '' .",
    "further , our general expressions allow us to calculate the cross sections also in the `` 1os '' kinematic region ( @xmath29 ) where at most one intermediate @xmath0 can ( but need not ) be on shell , and even in the `` nos '' region ( @xmath30 ) where both intermediate @xmath0 s always have to be off shell ( nos ) . for various choices of physical and kinematic parameters ,",
    "we calculate the total cross section for the mentioned lepton - number violating reactions and the corresponding expected numbers of events for @xmath1 colliders .",
    "our starting point is the rather general lagrangian density for the couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath0 with @xmath19 s and light leptons @xmath18 ( @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 s can be regarded , at first , as basically free parameters ( later we discuss some possible constraints on @xmath36 s ) . in eq .",
    "( [ nellw ] ) , @xmath37 is the standard @xmath38 gauge coupling parameter .",
    "we mention that the @xmath39 couplings could include , in principle , the right - handed parts , but this possibility will not be considered here .",
    "our choice would thus appear to suggest that the considered @xmath0 ( mass eigenstate ) is primarily sequential , i.e. , with the standard @xmath40 assignments .",
    "however , our choice can approximately describe also many other scenarios , including the one in which @xmath0 has an admixture of @xmath38-singlet component , provided the right - handed coupling analogous to ( [ nellw ] ) is reasonably suppressed .",
    "further , it turns out that parameters @xmath36 s affect the final results only via the combinations @xmath41 we will restrict ourselves to considering the reactions @xmath42 , which represent an explicit violation of the total lepton number ",

    "one of the reasons for this trend lies in the fact that higher @xmath15 ( at a given @xmath8 ) mean that more off - shell configurations are available for the intermediate @xmath0 s .",

    "[ figemu2]-[figemu5 ] , one technical difficulty with the general ( nos ) program should be mentioned .",
    "the results of the nos program were not depicted in the lowest parts of the 2os kinematic regions ( @xmath8 much lower than @xmath138 ) . in these regions of low @xmath8",
    ", the nos program requires exceedingly high statistics to avoid large numerical uncertainties .",
    "these numerical uncertainties arise because , for low @xmath8 s ( @xmath139@xmath140 ) only a very limited part of the rambo - generated phase space of final particles contributes to the cross section ( that would be true even when @xmath68 were , artificially by hand , prevented from approaching the zero value when @xmath141 ) .",
    "an additional important reason for these uncertainties lies in the fact that the integrand becomes very singularly peaked in small subregions of that mentioned part of the phase space .",
    "this is so because @xmath68 becomes small for small @xmath8 s , and consequently the absolute square of expression ( [ pn ] ) is then almost equal to @xmath142 \\delta[(p_{\\ell}\\!+\\!p_w)^2\\!-\\!m^2]$ ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figemu6 ] we plot the cross sections as function of the csm energy @xmath15 , at fixed chosen values of the majorana mass @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 gev . here",
    "we see that , at a given majorana neutrino mass @xmath8 , the full cross section usually ( but not always ) increases with increasing @xmath15 . at high csm energies @xmath146 ( 2os kinematic region ) ,",
    "the cross section changes only slowly with increasing @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ figemu6 ] , for @xmath143 gev only results of the 2os program ( in which both @xmath0 s are put on shell ) are displayed , since the general ( nos ) and the 1os programs show up the afore - mentioned numerical instabilities and large numerical uncertainties at so low values of @xmath8 .",
    "even for @xmath147 gev , the nos program has significant numerical uncertainties ( @xmath139@xmath148 ) for @xmath88 in the region @xmath149-@xmath150 tev , but these results were included nonetheless .",
    "one may ask how the depicted results change once we change the values of the `` mixing '' parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 [ cf .  eqs .",
    "( [ hph ] ) , ( [ hphrestr ] ) ] .",
    "it turns out that , for the 2os kinematic region ( @xmath28 ) , the cross sections ( and distributions ) as given by the general ( nos ) program depend on the parameter @xmath104 only weakly .",
    "this can be understood first in the formal way , because the absolute square of each of the two intermediate @xmath0-propagators ( when @xmath151 ) is approximately proportional to @xmath152 ( cf .",
    "previous discussion ) , while the sum of the squares of the amplitudes without @xmath0-propagators is proportional to @xmath106  the latter because of the two decay vertices @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( cf .",
    "[ figemu1 ] ) which are squared and summed ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this approximate @xmath104-independence can be expected on physical grounds : these cross sections are , for not too high @xmath15 , dominated by the configurations with two on - shell @xmath0 s ; but the absolute squares of amplitudes for @xmath101 [ combined with the decay branching ratios @xmath155 for the @xmath156 s ] are exactly @xmath104-independent .",
    "parameter @xmath104 , being responsible for the finite width ( note : @xmath157 ) , is apparently one of the two principal parameters responsible in the 2os kinematic region for the deviation of the cross section from the pure 2os cross section ( the other is @xmath15 ) . on the other hand , in the 1os kinematic region ( @xmath158 )",
    ", the @xmath104-dependence of the cross section becomes quite strong ( approximately @xmath159@xmath104 ) , and in the nos region ( @xmath30 ) even more so ( @xmath159@xmath106 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the cross sections on the parameter @xmath103 [ cf .",
    "( [ hph ] ) , ( [ atu ] ) ] is always strong ( @xmath159@xmath160 ) .",
    "we investigated the reactions @xmath161 where the intermediate @xmath0 s are heavy majorana neutrinos ( with mass @xmath12 gev ) and @xmath162 are light charged leptons ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "these processes violate the total lepton number and , if detected , would represent a clear signal of the majorana character of ( heavy ) neutrinos .",
    "in contrast to the expressions available in the literature so far where the intermediate @xmath0 s are taken to be _ on shell _ , we calculated the amplitudes of these processes by employing finite width propagators of the @xmath0 s .",
    "this enabled us to calculate numerically the full cross section for the reactions , i.e. , including the effects of the _ off - shell _ intermediate @xmath0 s .",
    "in contrast to the analogous reactions in @xmath2 ( and @xmath27 ) colliders , the considered reactions do not include a ( @xmath3-mediated ) @xmath4 channel , but only a ( @xmath19-mediated ) @xmath44 channel , thus allowing us to reduce the number of relevant unknown coupling parameters .",
    "if the cms process energies @xmath15 are large ( @xmath163 tev ) , the effects of the off - shell intermediate @xmath0 s can be significant even in the 2os kinematic region , i.e. , in the region @xmath164",
    "( @xmath165 ) where the configurations with both @xmath0 s being on shell are allowed .",
    "further , the number of such events at future @xmath1 colliders would be in general high enough for detection .",
    "for example , if assuming the integrated luminosity @xmath166 , and majorana mass @xmath143 gev ( @xmath144 gev ) , we would get about @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) events at @xmath175 and @xmath10 tev , respectively . these numbers have to be multiplied by two if we include also the events with two positively charged leptons in the final state ( the latter events also violate the total lepton number conservation , of course ) .",
    "we should stress that we used the highly suppressed values of the `` mixing '' parameters @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "these values are the maximal values allowed in theories where the heavy neutrinos are either sequential or have exotic @xmath129 assignments .",
    "if these bounds do not apply , the number of events can increase dramatically since it is proportional to @xmath178 .    in the paper , we ignored the questions connected with the experimental difficulties of detecting the discussed process unambiguously .",
    "in particular , there are problems connected with the identification of the ( on - shell ) @xmath19 s and some of the light charged leptons ( @xmath179 s ) .",
    "further , we ignored the possibility that the majorana neutrino mass @xmath8 is very low ",
    "below @xmath140 ( the @xmath113 s are then off shell ) @xcite . in such interesting cases of low @xmath8 ,",
