    "the simplest approximation for the @xmath2-behaviour of the high energy proton - proton differential elastic cross section is to assume that it is described by an exponent , d_el / dt = d_el / dt|_t=0(bt ) , where @xmath2 is the square of the four - momentum transfer , and @xmath6 is called the @xmath2-slope . the value of @xmath6 increases with energy .",
    "however more precise data indicate that actually the elastic cross section has a more complicated @xmath2-behaviour .",
    "in particular , the recent totem data  @xcite demonstrate that the local slope b = d[(d_el / dt]/dt varies with @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to understand these variations , for example , when we extrapolate the data to @xmath7 in order to determine the value of total @xmath0 cross section based on the optical theorem .",
    "the question was considered in  @xcite 14 years ago . here",
    "we update the discussion of these variations based on the new lhc data and on the improved understanding of high energy diffractive processes .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the local slope @xmath6 has several different components . in the present paper",
    "we use the formalism of regge theory to discuss the main factors which affect the value of the local slope @xmath6 considering , in particular , the region of small @xmath2 .",
    "we shall proceed step - by - step so as to expose the influence of the different components . in sect.2",
    "we consider a simplified model in which the proton - proton amplitude is described by single pomeron exchange . in this case",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath6 may be caused by the non - linearity of the pomeron trajectory or by a non - exponential @xmath2 dependence of the proton - pomeron coupling .",
    "in general , we have no reason to expect a linear form of the pomeron trajectory , @xmath9 .",
    "this is an approximation .",
    "the nearest singularity at @xmath10 gev@xmath11 corresponds to the production ( in @xmath2-channel ) of a pair of pions , and this threshold leads to a non - linear dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath2 . tuning the parameters in order to reproduce the experimental behaviour of the differential elastic cross section ( at least in the relatively low @xmath8 domain )",
    "we demonstrate numerically the possible role of this pion - loop insertion in the ( linear in the first approximation ) pomeron trajectory .",
    "then in the next subsection we evaluate the effect caused by replacing the exponential pomeron - proton coupling by the electromagnetic proton form factor @xmath13 , as , for example , used in the donnachie - landshoff parametrization  @xcite .",
    "both effects considered in this section lead to a decrease of @xmath6 with increasing @xmath8 .    in sect.3",
    "we account for the ` eikonal ' rescattering generated by two - particle @xmath14-channel unitarity . at low @xmath8 , before the first diffractive minimum , these absorptive corrections lead to a growth of the local slope @xmath6 with @xmath8 . in order to be in agreement with the data for low - mass proton diffractive dissociation",
    "we consider not only the one - channel , but also the two - channel eikonal model .",
    "we use the good - walker formalism and show the expected @xmath2-dependence of @xmath6 for different collider energies .",
    "the final predictions for the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath6 at various collider energies are shown in fig.8 .",
    "sect.4 contains a discussion and a comparison of the predictions of our model for @xmath15 with preliminary totem data at 8 tev , as well as with data at cern s@xmath16s and tevatron energies .",
    "the elastic proton - proton amplitude given by the one - pomeron exchange reads [ one ] a(s , t)=_0s_0_n^2(t)(ss_0)^_p(t)[i+((_p(t)-1)/2 ) ]  , where the expression in square brackets , @xmath17 $ ] , is the signature factor . following convention , we take the dimensionful scale @xmath18 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we use a normalization such that the differential elastic cross section is given by [ norm ]  =  .",
    "we first consider the simplest case with a linear pomeron trajectory [ traj - l ] _",

    "thus , in order to be in approximate agreement with the lhc elastic data , in the present one pomeron model we have had to use a value of @xmath25 gev@xmath24 larger than the canonical value @xmath29 gev@xmath24 of the donnachie - landshoff  @xcite fit . in a more complicated eikonal model ( considered in the next section ) , the increase of @xmath30 is provided by the screening effect described by multi - pomeron diagrams .",
    "the absorptive corrections suppress the contribution in centre of the disk and in this way enlarge the effective interaction radius .",
    "now let us account for the nearest @xmath2-channel singularity in the pomeron trajectory .",

    "some curvature in the @xmath2-dependence of the local slope is evident in the low @xmath38 gev@xmath11 region , especially at the larger energies .",
    "the effect is rather weak , due to the small numerical value of the factor @xmath39 in the last term of ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "the parameters turn out to be practically the same as before , but with a bit smaller value of @xmath26 ; namely @xmath22 mb , @xmath23 gev@xmath24 and @xmath40 gev@xmath24 .",
    "it is appropriate to ask how much flexibility exists in the pion - loop contribution .",
    "first , we discuss @xmath41 .",
    "the pole expression form for @xmath42 is the standard choice .",
    "however , the results do not noticeably depend on the explicit form of the @xmath2-dependence provided that this dependence reproduces a reasonable value of the mean @xmath2-slope . actually , the main assumption , concerning the value of the pion - loop contribution , is in ( [ eq:8 ] ) , where the additive quark model result ( that is the factor @xmath43 ) was used . on the other hand , this ratio @xmath44",
    "is confirmed by the data at lower energies .",
    "we can estimate the possible size of the effect looking at fig.9 below , where we present the ( dashed ) curves calculated without the pion loop contribution ( that is by replacing the factor ( 2/3 ) by 0 ) .",
    "example leads to about a 1.5 gev@xmath24 variation of the slope within the @xmath45 gev@xmath11 interval , which corresponds to a value of the coefficient @xmath46 gev@xmath47 in the parametrization @xmath48 .",
    "thus , making the conservative assumption that the pion - pomeron coupling ( the factor 2/3 ) is known with 25% accuracy , we expect less than a 0.05% deviation in the extrapolation of the differential cross section from @xmath49 gev@xmath11 to @xmath7 , coming from the uncertainty in the pion - loop contribution .",
