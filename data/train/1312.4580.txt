    "cege@xmath9 appears to be one of the simple binary compounds that has a benefit of being of a interest for a number of years . over",
    "50 years ago it was reported to be a ferromagnet with the curie temperature @xmath10 k that crystallizes in the orthorhombically distorted thsi@xmath9 structure .",
    "@xcite the crystal structure of cege@xmath9 was studied further . @xcite it was identified either as a tetragonal @xmath11-thsi@xmath9 type @xcite , or as an orthorhombic @xmath11-gdsi@xmath9 type .",
    "@xcite magnetization and heat capacity measurements @xcite suggested ferromagnetic order with @xmath12 k. similar @xmath12 k value and the kondo temperature @xmath13 k were reported in @xcite .",
    "detailed magnetization study of cege@xmath9 @xcite proposed two magnetic transitions in this material , antiferromagnetic , at @xmath14 k and ferromagnetic , at lower temperature , @xmath15 k.    the inconsistencies in determination of the crystal structure in early publications appeared to have a simple explanation . with further studies of the ce - ge binary phase diagram",
    "it was realized that cege@xmath9 is not a stoichiometric , line , compound , but has a depleted structure with a width of formation , cege@xmath0 with @xmath16 , or larger ( see below ) @xcite a transition from high temperature , tetragonal , @xmath11-thsi@xmath9 type structure to low temperature , orthorhombic , @xmath11-gdsi@xmath9 type was reported at temperatures between 560@xmath17c ( @xmath18 ) and 490@xmath17c ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xcite    within the range of ge concentrations between 1.71 and 2.0 the orthorhombic crystal structure , and two magnetic transitions , with @xmath20 k and @xmath21 k , virtually independent on ge concentration , were reported .",
    "@xcite for lower ge concentrations , between cege@xmath22 and cege@xmath23 , a tetragonal crystal structure and a single , antiferromagnetic , transition with @xmath20 k ( and no other magnetic transition down to 0.5 k ) were observed .",
    "@xcite the latter magnetic results were challenged by conclusions in @xcite , where two magnetic transitions , one at 6.7 k and another , ferromagnetic , at 5.3 k were described for the tetragonal cege@xmath22 .    given that majority of the studies , in particular for orthorhombic cege@xmath0 with higher ge concentration , were performed on polycrystalline samples ( as a result the anisotropies of physical properties were not accessed ) and that the literature data contains apparent inconsistencies , we report a detailed study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of cege@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) single crystals .",
    "single crystals of cege@xmath0 were grown using the high - temperature solution technique . @xcite the constituent elements , with an initial stoichiometry of ce@xmath24ge@xmath25 , were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a fused silica tube under a partial ar pressure .",
    "the ampule was heated up to 1190@xmath17c and then was cooled down to 890@xmath17c over @xmath26 hours .",
    "after that the flux was decanted , meaning that the resulting single crystals were effectively quenched to room temperature from to 890@xmath17c over several minutes .",
    "the crystals grow as large plates , with the dimensions in excess of @xmath27 mm@xmath28 , with the @xmath7-axis perpendicular to the plate ( see below ) .    from earlier work @xcite and the binary ce - ge phase diagram @xcite",
    "the crystals are expected to have some ge - deficiency , cege@xmath0 .",
    "elemental analysis was performed on these crystals using wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in the electron probe microanalyzer of a jeol jxa-8200 electron microprobe .",
    "ce@xmath9fe@xmath29 and elemental ge were used as the standards .",
    "the stoichiometry of the samples was determined to be cege@xmath30 with the error bar in the value of @xmath31 of about or less than 0.01 . at first glance",
    ", it appears that this result contradicts the established width of formation shown in the binary phase diagram.@xcite we argue that the spacing between the experimental points in the original papers @xcite and the error bars present in this work as well as in the original publications allow to remove this apparent contradiction .",
    "given our growth method this result implies that the ge - rich side of the width of formation should be shifted from ce@xmath32ge@xmath33 to this composition ( ce@xmath34ge@xmath35 ) .",
    "we will use the notation cege@xmath30 for the samples studied in this work .",
    "room temperature powder x - ray diffraction measurements were taken using cu-@xmath36 radiation in a rigaku miniflex diffractometer .",
    "the spectrum was refined using a rietica software .",
    "@xcite the x - ray data ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) are consistent with the sample being orthorhombic with the lattice parameters @xmath37  , @xmath38  , and @xmath39  , the values similar to those reported in refs @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that a complex superstructure originating from a partial ordering of the ge vacancies was reported for a sample with a very close ge - concentration , cege@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the resolution of our x - ray diffraction data was not sufficient to detect such a superstructure , if present .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the optical image of the surface of the crystal taken with optical , polarized light , microscope at room temperature .",
    "the very clear domain structure is an evidence of a solid - solid phase transition above room temperature and is fully consistent with the reported tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition near to 500@xmath17c .",
    "@xcite the long orthorhombic domains with the very wide range of width , from @xmath41 m to @xmath42 m , are clearly seen .",
    "the existence of such domains implies that without de - twinning of the crystals measured in - plane properties will represent some average between @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions .",
    "additional scattering on the domain boundaries might worsen the in - plane resistivity values .",
    "anisotropic , temperature dependent , and field dependent dc magnetization was measured using commercial quantum design mpms-5 and mpms-7 units . in - plane ac resistivity ( @xmath45 ma , @xmath46 hz )",
    "was measured using an act option of a quantum design ppms-14 instrument .",
    "the heat capacity data were taken using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument .",
    "thermoelectric power ( tep ) measurements were carried out by dc , alternating heating ( two - heaters - two - thermometers ) , technique @xcite over the temperature range from 2 to 300 k. thermal expansion and magnetostriction were measured using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of ofhc copper .",
    "@xcite the dilatometer was mounted in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument and was operated over a temperature range of 1.8 - 300 k in magnetic field up to 140 koe . due to aforementioned presence of the orthorhombic domains , the @xmath47 dilation was measured along an arbitrary in - plane direction .",
    "in - plane , temperature dependent resistivity of the cege@xmath30 crystal is shown in fig .",
    "it features a very broad hump at about 50 k and a shallow minimum just above the sharp drop in resistivity below @xmath48 k. the residual resistivity ratio , @xmath49 is approximately 3.5 . such relatively high value of the @xmath50 ( compare e.g. with the @xmath50 values of ni - defficient _",
    "r_nige@xmath51 , it r = rare earth , single crystals @xcite ) hints at possibility of the ordering of the ge vacansies suggested earlier , @xcite for a sample with a stoichiometry that is essentially cege@xmath40 .",
    "this temperature behavior is similar to that observed in other heavy fermion or intermediate valence compounds with a low temperature magnetic order .",
    "the temperature derivative of the resistivity data , @xmath52 , @xcite clearly shows two distinct features , at 7.1 k and 3.8 k , suggesting two magnetic transitions in this material .",
    "large magnetic fields suppress the features , and low temperature magnetoresistance is negative .",
    "the overall resistivity behavior is similar to what was reported for cege@xmath53 @xcite , tetragonal cege@xmath22 @xcite and cege@xmath9 @xcite , despite the differences is stoichometry that do affect the number and exact temperature of transitions detected in low temperature resistivity .",
    "anisotropic , inverse , temperature - dependent dc susceptibility , @xmath54 , measured at 10 koe is shown in fig .",
    "the polycrystalline average was calculated as @xmath55 .",
    "the susceptibility is anisotropic with @xmath56 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "the curie - weiss fits of the high temperature ( 150  k @xmath57 300  k ) susceptibility data , @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are curie constant and curie - weiss temperature , respectively ) yield the effective moment ( from @xmath61 ) @xmath62 , consistent with the theoretical value for ce@xmath63 , and the curie - weiss temperatures , @xmath64 k , @xmath65 k , and @xmath66 k. the signs of the curie - weiss temperatures suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions dominate in the @xmath47-plane whereas ferromagnetic ones are predominant along the @xmath7-axis . the low temperature , low field magnetization data are shown in the inset to fig . [ f4 ] .",
    "these data further confirm magnetic transitions at @xmath48 k and @xmath67 k. in addition , the data for @xmath68 suggests one more transition , at @xmath69 k ( see fig . [ f10 ] and discussion below ) .    the temperature dependent heat capacity ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) has a clear , distinct feature at @xmath70 k and somewhat less pronounces anomaly @xmath71 k ( seen as a knee when the data are plotted as @xmath72 vs @xmath73 , fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , inset ) .",
    "there appear to be other small deviations in @xmath74 behavior in the 3.7 k @xmath75 7 k temperature range .",
    "they do not have corresponding anomalies in resistivity , however the one at @xmath69 k is consistent with the anomaly in the in - plane low field magnetization , mentioned above .",
    "the sommerfeld coefficient , estimated from the linear fit of @xmath72 vs @xmath73 above the transitions , between the 150 k@xmath3 and 300 k@xmath3 values of @xmath73 ( 12 - 17 k in the units of @xmath76 ) is enhanced , @xmath77 mj / mol k@xmath3 .",
    "this value of the sommerfeld coefficient is similar to that reported for cege@xmath9 and cege@xmath78 @xcite and is noticeably higher than the values reported for cege@xmath79 and cege@xmath22 .",
    "@xcite a rough estimate of the magnetic entropy associated with the magnetic transitions ( integration up to @xmath80 k ) gives the value of @xmath81 .",
    "anisotropic temperature - dependent dilation of cege@xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "the overall change of volume from the base temperature , 1.8 k to 300 k is close to 1% , that is similar to the change of volume in cu @xcite and is approximately factor of two larger than that of yni@xmath9b@xmath9c @xcite . in - plane",
    "thermal dilation is positive over the whole temperature range and is close to linear in temperature above @xmath82 k with the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath83 k@xmath84 .",
    "negative thermal expansion along the @xmath7-axis is observed in cege@xmath30 below @xmath85 k with the volume thermal expansion being positive in the whole temperature range .",
    "the upper transition is clearly seen at @xmath86 k in both anisotropic dilation and thermal expansion coefficients ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , inset ) .",
    "the lower transition is seen as a small step - like feature at @xmath87 k in @xmath88 . in @xmath89 a well - defined minimum at temperature @xmath90 k is seen , in agreement with the positions of anomalies in the @xmath91 and the heat capacity .",
    "since the magnetic transition at @xmath48 k appears to be the second order , we can use our heat capacity and thermal expansion results to evaluate the initial uniaxial and total pressure derivatives of this transition using the ehrenfest relation , @xcite : @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the molar volume ( @xmath94 m@xmath28 using the lattice parameters from the x - ray diffraction ) , @xmath95 is the jump in the thermal expansion coefficient at the phase transition , and @xmath96 is the corresponding jump in the heat capacity . using the experimental data above , for cege@xmath30 we found out that in - plane uniaxial pressure derivative is positive , @xmath97 k / kbar , whereas the @xmath7-axis uniaxial pressure derivative is very similar in its absolute value but negative @xmath98 k / kbar .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure derivative can be approximated as @xmath99 k / kbar .",
    "so it appears that cege@xmath30 is equally sensitive to uniaxial pressure applied in the @xmath47 - plane and along the @xmath7-axis , however the upper magnetic transition temperature increases when the pressure is applied in the @xmath47 - plane and decreases when it is applied along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the absolute values of the pressure derivatives are fairly small .",
    "the absolute value of the uniaxial pressure derivatives are close to those inferred for orthorhombic cevsb@xmath51 @xcite , however for cevsb@xmath51 all uniaxial pressure derivatives have the same , positive , sign .",
    "cege@xmath30 , like cevsb@xmath51 , may be close to a local maximum in ordering temperature and pressures up to 7 gpa may well be able to suppress the magnetic transition to a quantum phase transition .",
    "temperature - dependent , in - plane , tep data for cege@xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . on a gross level",
    "these data are similar to those reported for cege@xmath9 . @xcite the data show two maxima , a broad one at @xmath100 k ( corresponding to the lowest crystal electric field splitting of the energy levels @xcite ) and a sharper one , at @xmath101 k and a minimum at @xmath102 k. since it is expected that @xmath103 , another minimum , below 2 k is anticipated . above @xmath104",
    "k the tep is linear in temperature , indicating that in this temperature region the diffusion tep is dominant .",
    "the tep changes sign several times , being negative above @xmath105 k , positive between @xmath106 k and @xmath105 k , then negative below @xmath106 k with a very short positive excursion between 3.0 k and 3.8 k. two low temperature transitions , at @xmath86 and @xmath107 k , are clearly seen in the @xmath108 ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , inset ) , the upper one as a sharp minimum and the lower one as a change in slope .",
    "there appears to be an additional , step - like feature in the @xmath108 at @xmath5 k , close to the temperature of small anomalies in the thermodynamic measurements discussed above .",
    "low - field , five - quadrant , anisotropic magnetization loops for cege@xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "these data suggest that there is a ferromagnetic component in the magnetization along the @xmath7 - axis at 1.85 k , with a rather small , @xmath110 per cerium , saturated moment and very narrow hysteresis loop .",
    "the width of the loop and the saturated moment along the @xmath7 - axis are smaller than those of stoichiometric and magnetically soft ceagsb@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this virtual absence of hysteresis again hints at possible order of vacancies ( perhaphs in a cege@xmath40 , or ce@xmath111ge@xmath112 , structure ) or at least lack of pinning , even on domain walls .",
    "the apparent low field ferromagnetic loop measured for the magnetic field in the @xmath47 plane might be intrinsic , but very possibly is a result of a slight ( less than 0.5@xmath17 ) misallignment of the sample .",
    "additional features , corresponding to metamagnetic transitions , are observed in the anisotropic @xmath113 data , taken up to higher , 10 koe , field at different temperatures ( fig .",
    "magnetization data between 10 koe and 55 koe for both orientations ( not shown ) are monotonic , with no additional features .",
    "the saturated magnetization in both directions is below @xmath8 .",
    "the magnetization isotherms measured at different temperatures and low temperature , temperature - dependent magnetization measured at different fields ( fig . [ f10 ] ) allow for construction an anisotropic , @xmath109 , phase diagrams for cege@xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ f11 ] ) .",
    "the points obtained from @xmath114 and @xmath113 data are consistent with each other . for @xmath115 the points obtained from resistivity , thermoelectric power , thermal expansion and heat capacity ( as described in the text above ) are added .",
    "whereas the @xmath116 direction is unique , the phase diagram for @xmath68 is shown for some guidance only , since twinning and exact orientation might affect the number and the exact position of the phase lines .",
    "phase i is the phase with a ferromagnetic component along the @xmath7 - axis , phase ii is a higher temperature antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "phase iv , if indeed exists , is located @xmath117 k and @xmath118 k in zero field , and probably disappears by 0.5 - 1 koe .",
    "phase v for @xmath68 is a metamagnetic phase.the phase marked as iii appears to be the phase corresponding to saturated paramagnetic state .",
    "the magnetic field scales for cege@xmath30 are rather small , not exceding 10 koe , suggesting certain fragility of the magnetic order in this material .",
    "we presented results of a comprehensive study of thermodynamic and transport measurements on cege@xmath30 single crystals .",
    "although formally it is an extreme member of the cege@xmath0 family , the wds data are consistent with cege@xmath40 or ce@xmath111ge@xmath112 and both resistivity data and magnetization loop data are consistent with a well ordered compound .",
    "this material has an enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient and two magnetic ordering transitions , at @xmath4 k and at @xmath6 k , and possibly a third one , at @xmath119 k that is observed as a small anomaly in a number of measurements .",
    "the ground state characterized by a possibly compex magnetic structure with a ferromagnetic component along the @xmath7 - axis corresponding to a magnetic moment of @xmath120 per ce .",
    "the response of the cege@xmath30 to the applied magnetic field is anisotropic , with metamagnetism ( spin reorientation ) observed in both directions .",
    "this simple binary material is a good candidate for neutron scattering studies as well as for studies of the evolution of its magnetism under pressure . to some extent ,",
    "cege@xmath30 has similarities to other ce - based , reduced moment ferromagnets , like ceagsb@xmath9 @xcite and ceru@xmath9ge@xmath9 @xcite , the studies of which yield interesting results related to quantum phase transitions and strongly correlated behavior .",
