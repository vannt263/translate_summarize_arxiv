    "could be gained by assuming that the charged particles admit an additional `` exotic '' structure , which makes the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath7 non - commuting @xcite .    in this note",
    "we generalize hill s equations to exotic particles , providing us with a combination of the hill results in @xcite with the hall - type behavior found before in the non - commutative landau problem @xcite .",
