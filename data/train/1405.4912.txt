    "cancer is one of the diseases causing the most deaths in the world , despite the best efforts of medicine .",
    "human and financial resources are devoted for cancer research , and on several occasions these efforts are successful @xcite .",
    "some comments on the importance of mathematical modeling in cancer can be found in the literature . in the work",
    "@xcite the authors say `` cancer modelling has , over the years , grown immensely as one of the challenging topics involving applied mathematicians working with researchers active in the biological sciences .",
    "the motivation is not only scientific as in the industrial nations cancer has now moved from seventh to second place in the league table of fatal diseases , being surpassed only by cardiovascular diseases . ''",
    "we use the analysis proposed by gatenby in @xcite , which supports the acid - mediated invasion hypothesis .",
    "therefore , it can be represented mathematically as a reaction - diffusion system which describes the spatial and temporal evolution of the tumor tissue , normal tissue , and excess concentration of h@xmath0 .",
    "the model simulates a ph gradient extending from the tumor - host interface .",
    "the effect of biological parameters that control this transition is supported by experimental and clinical observations @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite model tumor invasion in order to find an underlying mechanism by which primary and metastatic cancers invade and destroy normal tissues .",
    "they do not attempt to model the genetic changes that lead to the transformation and seek to understand the causes of these changes .",
    "likewise , they do not attempt to model the large - scale morphological aspects of tumor necrosis such as central necrosis . instead",
    ", they concentrate on the interactions of microscopic scale populations that occur at the tumor - host interface , arguing that these processes influence the clinically significant manifestations of invasive cancer .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors suppose that transformation - induced reversion of neoplastic tissue to primitive glycolytic metabolic pathways , with resultant increased acid production and the diffusion of that acid into surrounding healthy tissue , creates a peritumoral micro - environment in which the tumor cells survive and proliferate , while normal cells may not remain viable .",
    "the following temporal sequence would derive : ( a ) a high concentration of h@xmath0 ions in tumors will diffuse chemically as a gradient to adjacent normal tissue , exposing these normal cells to an interstitial ph like in the tumor , ( b ) normal cells immediately adjacent to the edge of the tumor are unable to survive in chronically this acid environment , and ( c ) progressive loss of normal cell layers in the tumor - host interface facilitates tumor invasion .",
    "key elements of this mechanism of tumor invasion include low ph due to primitive metabolism and reduced viability of normal tissue in an acidic environment .",
    "this model depends only on a small number of cellular and sub - cellular parameters .",
    "the analysis of the equations shows that the model simulates a crossover from a benign tumor to a malignant invasive tumor when some combination of parameters turn over some threshold value .",
    "the structure and dynamics of the tumor - host interface in invasive cancers are controlled by the same parameters which generate a transformation from a benign tumor into malignant tumor . a hypo - cellular interstitial space , as we can see in figure [ fig : gap ] ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4a ) , occurs in some cancers .        in this paper",
    "we propose a framework via a pde - constrained optimization problem that can be solved with the splitting method , exploiting the fact that this procedure is easily parallelizable .",
    "we follow the pde - based model by gatenby @xcite in a two - dimensional tissue .",
    "we estimate one of the model parameters ( the destructive influence of h@xmath0 ions in the healthy tissue ) using an inverse problem .",
    "it is possible to get data about the concentration of hydrogen ions @xcite via fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy . in this approach",
    ", tumor invasion is modeled via a coupled nonlinear system of partial differential equations , which makes the numerical solution procedure quite challenging .",
    "these equations are solved using an adaptive finite element method ( afem ) .",
    "this kind of problem constitutes a particular application of the so - called inverse problems , which are being increasingly used in a broad number of fields in applied sciences .",
    "for instance , problems referred to structured population dynamics @xcite , computerized tomography and image reconstruction in medical imaging @xcite , and more specifically tumor growth @xcite , among many others .",
    "we solve a minimization problem using a gradient - based method considering the adjoint method in order to find the derivative of an objective functional . in this way",
    ", we would obtain the best parameter that fits patient - specific data .",
    "this work follows the ideas @xcite where the space variable was in a one dimensional space .",
    "the extension of the model to two dimensional space allows us to approach the results to more realistic biological hypotheses .",
    "the contents of this paper , which is organized into 5 sections , are as follows : section 2 consists in some preliminaries about the model , the definition of variational form of the direct and adjoint problems , and the minimization problem .",
    "section 3 deals with suitable numerical algorithms to solve the direct and adjoint problems .",
    "in particular , we use the splitting method and the adaptive finite element method with a computation of _ a posteriori _ error . in section 4",
    "we show numerical simulations of the retrieved parameter and the need of a parallel scheme .",
    "section 5 presents the conclusions and some future work related to the contents of this paper .",
    "some words about our notation .",
    "we use @xmath1 to denote the @xmath2 inner product ( the space is always clear from the context ) and we consider the sum of inner products for a cartesian product of spaces . for a function @xmath3 such that @xmath4 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the full frchet - derivative and by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the partial frchet - derivatives of @xmath8 at @xmath9 . for a linear operator @xmath10",
    "we denote @xmath11 the adjoint operator of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath12 is invertible , we call @xmath13 the inverse of the adjoint operator @xmath14 .",
    "a mathematical model of the tumor - host interface based on the acid mediation hypothesis of tumor invasion due to @xcite is given by the following system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) : @xmath15 where the variables are in @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "these equations determine the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of three fields : @xmath17 , the density of normal tissue ; @xmath18 , the density of neoplastic tissue ; and @xmath19 , the excess concentration of h@xmath0 ions .",
    "the units of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are cells/@xmath20 and @xmath19 is expressed as a molarity ( m ) . the space @xmath21 and time @xmath22 are given in cm and seconds , respectively .",
    "the biological meaning of each equation can be seen in @xcite , and the non - dimensional mathematical model is : @xmath23 where the four dimensionless quantities which parameterize the model are given by : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction parameters between different cells ( healthy and tumor ) and concentration of h@xmath0 are difficult to measure experimentally .",
    "this is the reason for which we propose to estimate them , so we will focus on @xmath28 in this work .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions considered for the non - dimensional system are : @xmath29 \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial u_1 } { \\partial n } ( x , t ) = 0 , & \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial u_2 } { \\partial n } ( x , t ) = 0 , & \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial u_3 } { \\partial n } ( x , t ) = 0 , \\quad \\forall \\ , x \\in \\partial \\omega .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    from now on , equations ( [ nondim ] ) with the initial and boundary conditions will be referred to as the direct problem .      using the variational techniques for obtaining the weak solution of the direct problem @xcite , it can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 such that @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we use @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41    a weak solution @xmath42 is a function that satisfies @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "as described above we propose to use an inverse problem technique in order to estimate @xmath28 .",
    "function @xmath45 represents the solution of the direct problem ( the components of @xmath45 are the state variables of the problem ) for each choice of the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "let us assume that experimental information is available during the time interval @xmath46 .",
    "then , the inverse mathematical problem can be formulated as : @xmath47 where the objective functional @xmath48 is @xmath49 ^ 2 dxdt,\\ ] ] with @xmath50 , the excess concentration of h@xmath0 ions obtained by solving the direct problem for a certain choice of @xmath28 and @xmath51 , the excess concentration measured experimentally ( real data ) .",

    "* figure 4 ) . ]",
    "we remark that , in general , there is a fundamental difference between the direct and the inverse problems .",
    "in fact , the latter is usually ill - posed in the sense of existence , uniqueness and stability of the solution .",
    "this inconvenient is often treated by using some regularization techniques @xcite .      in the following",
    ", we will consider the so - called reduced problem @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given as the solution of @xmath57 . in order to find a minimum of the continuously differentiable function @xmath58",
    ", it will be important to compute the derivative of this reduced objective function .",
    "hence , we will show a procedure to obtain @xmath59 by using the adjoint approach . according to the theory exposed in @xcite ,",
    "the derivative of @xmath58 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 solves the so - called adjoint problem @xmath62    notice that in order to obtain @xmath63 we need first to compute @xmath56 by solving the direct problem , followed by the calculation of @xmath61 by solving the adjoint problem .",
    "for computing the second term of ( [ adjoint2 ] ) it is not necessary to obtain the adjoint of @xmath64 but just its action over @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the adjoint problem ( [ adjoint ] ) consists in finding @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then , since @xmath69 , ( [ adjoint2 ] ) can be written as @xmath70",
    "it is worth stressing that obtaining model parameters via minimization of the objective functional @xmath58 is in general an iterative process requiring the value of the derivative . to compute @xmath59 we just solve two weak pdes problems per iteration : the direct and the adjoint problems",
    "this method is much cheaper than the sensitivity approach @xcite in which the direct problem is solved many times per iteration .",
    "we develop an implementation in matlab that solves the direct and adjoint problems .",
    "we use the splitting method in order to separate the direct problem in two new problems .",
    "the first one consists in a system of ordinary differential equations that contains the reaction terms of the original pde .",
    "the second one is a pde that contains the diffusion terms of the original pde .",
    "the odes are solved by using the runge - kutta method ( ode45 matlab built - in function ) .",
    "since we have an ode system for each spatial point , its resolution can be parallelized accelerating the time execution .",
    "the pde is solved by the adaptive finite element method . in the next subsections",
    "we will explain the splitting method and the adaptive procedure of the fem .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that gradient - based optimization algorithms require the evaluation of the gradient of the functional .",
    "the optimization problem is solved by using a sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) method , using the built - in function fmincon .    for the direct problem ,",
