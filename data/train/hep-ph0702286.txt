    "such a study is interesting since the sum rule of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) @xcite provides a means of exploring the structure of the neutrino mass matrix in the presence of charged lepton corrections , and enables whole classes of models of neutrino masses and mixings to be tested .",
    "however , exploring the sum rule requires to measure the currently undetermined mixing angle @xmath15 as well as the cp violating phase @xmath16 , which is experimentally challenging , as we shall discuss .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] we present for the first time a parameterization - independent derivation of a family of neutrino mixing sum rules , and subsequently show that one of them leads to the sum rule in eq .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , the pmns matrix @xmath23 , is defined as the matrix which appears in the electroweak coupling to the @xmath24 bosons expressed in terms of lepton mass eigenstates . with the mass matrices of charged leptons @xmath25 and neutrinos @xmath26 written as @xmath27 and performing the transformation from flavour to mass basis by @xmath28 the pmns matrix is given by @xmath29 here",
    "it is assumed implicitly that unphysical phases are removed by field redefinitions , and @xmath30 contains one dirac phase and two majorana phases .",
    "the latter are physical only in the case of majorana neutrinos , for dirac neutrinos the two majorana phases can be absorbed as well .",
    "many attractive classes of models lead to interesting predictions for the neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 , such as for instance tri - bimaximal @xcite or bimaximal @xcite mixing where @xmath31 takes the forms @xmath32 respectively , although the sum rule is not necessarily restricted to either of these two forms . as mentioned in the introduction such predictions are not directly experimentally accessible because of the presence of the charged lepton corrections .",
    "however , this challenge can be overcome when we make the additional assumption that the charged lepton mixing matrix has a ckm - like structure , in the sense that @xmath12 is dominated by a 1 - 2 mixing , i.e.  that its elements @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are very small compared to @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . in the following simplified derivation , we shall take these elements to be approximately zero , i.e.@xmath39 and later on comment on the effect of them being non - zero ( see footnote [ theta12e ] ) . for a derivation including these elements , see @xcite .",
    "this situation arises in many generic classes of flavour models in the context of unified theories of fundamental interactions , where quarks and leptons are joined in representations of the unified gauge symmetries  @xcite .    under this assumption",
    ", it follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmns_definition ] ) that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are independent of @xmath12 , and depend only on the diagonalization matrix @xmath31 of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this leads to the parameterization - independent sum rules which we give in this form for the first time :    [ eq : invsumrules]@xmath43    these innocuous looking relations enable powerful tests of the structure of the neutrino mass matrix in the presence of charged lepton corrections .",
    "note that the left - hand sides of these relations involve neutrino mixing matrix elements in a particular basis , whereas the right - hand sides are basis invariant quantities .",
    "this makes sense in the framework of a flavour theory which has a preferred basis , the so - called `` theory basis . ''",
    "let us now study the sum rules in the standard pdg parameterization of the pmns matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath44 which is used in most analyses of neutrino oscillation experiments . here",
    "@xmath16 is the so - called dirac cp violating phase which is in principle measurable in neutrino oscillation experiments , and @xmath45 contains the majorana phases @xmath46 . in the following",
    "we will use this standard parameterization ( including additional phases ) also for @xmath31 and denote the corresponding mixing angles by @xmath47 , while the mixing angles @xmath48 without superscript refer to the pmns matrix .",
    "in addition to the assumption that @xmath12 is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : assumptionforue ] ) we will now assume that the 1 - 3 mixing in the neutrino mass matrix is negligible , @xmath49 many textures for the neutrino mass matrix fulfill this relation exactly , for example the cases of bimaximal and tri - bimaximal mixing , although the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : th13nu ] ) is more general . using the assumption ( [ eq : th13nu ] ) in the sum rule of eq .",

    "( [ eq : sumrule_abs ] ) leads to the sum rule @xmath53 which holds up to first order in @xmath15 .",
    "hence , we have obtained an approximate expression for the ( in general unobservable ) mixing angle @xmath1 in terms of directly measurable parameters of the pmns matrix .",
    "this sum rule can be used to test a bimaximal ( @xmath54 ) or tri - bimaximal ( @xmath55 ) structure of the neutrino mass matrix , but may as well be applied for a different pattern beyond these two examples . in the following",

    "we will not explore this relation further but focus on the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) .",
    "note , however , that under the assumptions ( [ eq : assumptionforue ] ) and ( [ eq : th13nu ] ) the only mixing parameters of the model are @xmath62 , and through the relations ( [ eq : th13rule ] ) , ( [ eq : sumrule - gen ] ) , ( [ eq : th23rule ] ) all of them can be expressed in terms of measurable pmns parameters .",
    "finally , we mention that under the above assumptions eq .",
    "( [ eq : th23rule ] ) can be used to test predictions for @xmath63 .",
    "this is complementary to the application of the sum rule for @xmath1 , and a precise determination of @xmath64 will allow for an additional test of predictions for the neutrino mass matrix . if the assumption of eq .",

    "prospects for the measurement of deviations from maximal 2 - 3 mixing have been discussed e.g.  in ref .",

    "the fit is fully consistent with the data and a best fit point at the same @xmath76 as the unconstrained fit is found .",
    "this follows since the best fit point @xmath80 is close to the tri - bimaximal mixing value .",
    "indeed , for small values of @xmath15 , say less than @xmath81 , the sum rule is satisfied within current experimental errors , for all values @xmath82 . on the other hand , the sum rule leads to a strengthening of the bound on @xmath15 in the regions where @xmath83 .",

    "this would not change the reasoning of this paper , since @xmath1 still can be expressed only in terms of measurable quantities , involving now also @xmath64 .",
    "hence , condition ( _ c _ ) has been adopted here just for simplicity .",
    "condition ( _ a _ ) holds for a large class of models . for example , in many gut models the charged lepton mixing matrix is related to the quark mixing matrix since quarks and leptons are joined in representations of the unified gauge symmetries . on the other hand , conditions ( _ b _ ) and ( _ c _ ) are rather typical for flavour models in the neutrino sector . in particular , the popular examples of bimaximal and tri - bimaximal mixing fulfill conditions ( _ b _ ) and ( _ c _ ) exactly .    we have demonstrated the usefulness of the sum rule by imposing it as a constraint in a fit to present global data from neutrino oscillation experiments under the assumptions of bimaximal and tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing .",
    "this analysis shows that under the condition ( _ a _ ) bimaximal neutrino mixing is disfavoured at about @xmath124 by present data with respect to tri - bimaximal mixing , which is perfectly compatible with the data .",
    "if the fit for bimaximal mixing is accepted the sum rule predicts that @xmath15 is close to its present bound and @xmath125 .    in the main part of the paper we have concentrated on the sum rule in the context of future high precision neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we have considered long - baseline reactor experiments for a precise measurement of @xmath14 , as well as six examples for advanced long - baseline accelerator experiments to constrain the parameter combination @xmath85 appearing in the sum rule .",
    "these setups include three options for second generation superbeam experiments , a @xmath22-beam , and two examples for a neutrino factory .",
    "it is shown that most of these experiments will allow for a rather precise testing of the sum rule , and @xmath1 can be inferred within an accuracy of few degrees , where the precise value shows some dependence on the true values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath126 the accuracy is dominated by the error on @xmath14 , whereas for large values of @xmath15 the precision on the term @xmath85 dominates . obviously its impact is larger for @xmath115 . because of the appearance of @xmath82 experiments operating not only at the first oscillation maximum ( where there is good sensitivity to @xmath127 ) are well suited for this kind of measurement , for example a neutrino factory or a wide - band superbeam .",
    "another interesting observation is that the mass hierarchy degeneracy plays an important role .",
    "since this degeneracy introduces an ambiguity in the cp phase @xmath16 its appearance significantly reduces the information on @xmath1 which can be extracted from the sum rule .    to conclude , the neutrino mixing sum rule considered in this work is a convenient tool to explore the structure of the neutrino mass matrix in the presence of charged lepton corrections , and to test whole classes of models of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "already applied to present data it is possible to obtain non - trivial statements , whereas with future high precision oscillation experiments a rather accurate testing of models will become possible in the framework of the sum rule .",
