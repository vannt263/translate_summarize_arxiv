    "the systematic differences in morphology between field and cluster galaxy populations have long been known ( e.g. hubble & humason 1931 ; oemler 1974 ) .",
    "more recently , data from hst has shown the remarkable changes in cluster galaxy populations between intermediate redshifts ( @xmath2 ) and the present .",
    "intermediate redshift clusters contain a large population of blue , star forming galaxies , which have been shown to be predominantly normal spiral and irregular galaxies , a fraction of which are interacting or obviously disturbed ( e.g. butcher & oemler 1978 ; dressler et al .",
    "1994 ; oemler , dressler & butcher 1997 ; smail et al .",
    "they constitute up to 50% of the cluster population , but by the present epoch have been depleted by a factor of two in rich clusters and have been replaced by a corresponding increase in the s0 population ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "what processes are responsible for this rapid depletion of the spiral population and corresponding increase in s0s in rich clusters since @xmath3 ? there have been many suggested mechanisms , either to remove gas and/or induce star formation , some of which depend on galaxy  galaxy collisions ( e.g. spitzer & baade 1951 ; miller 1988 ; valluri & jog 1990 ) or on the effect of the intracluster medium ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ; cowie & songaila 1977 ) , or on tidal shocks whether from galaxy  galaxy or cluster  galaxy interactions ( e.g. noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ; lavery & henry 1988 ; sanders et al . 1988 ; henriksen & byrd 1996 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "nearby rich clusters have a residual population of spiral galaxies .",
    "if one or several of the proposed mechanisms have been operating to transform spirals into s0s over the relatively short look - back time to @xmath3 , it is clear that we might expect the same processes to be continuing to operate in the present on the residual population of spirals in clusters .",
    "these processes can be more easily studied in nearby clusters than at higher redshifts .",
    "furthermore all of the proposed mechanisms involve potentially dramatic changes in the star formation rates in spirals .",
    "thus a comparison of star formation rates between spirals in nearby clusters and those in the field may provide the observational evidence to help decide the physical mechanism which has been responsible for the dramatic recent change in the cluster disk galaxy population .    in practice",
    ", it has proved difficult to establish agreement amongst different authors regarding changes of star formation rate between field and cluster spirals .",
    "however , much recent work supports either similar or enhanced star formation in cluster spirals compared to field spirals ( e.g. donas et al .",
    "1990 ; moss & whittle 1993 [ paper ii ] ; gavazzi & contursi 1994 ; biviano et al .",
    "1997 ; moss , whittle & pesce 1998 [ paper iii ] ; gavazzi et al .",
    "biviano et al . have suggested that earlier studies which claimed reduced star formation in cluster spirals may have been affected by an unrecognised bias whereby faint field galaxies are more likely to be detected in emission than their cluster counterparts .",
    "two recent studies ( balogh et al . 1998 ; hashimoto et al . 1998 ) have found a suppression of star formation in cluster galaxies relative to galaxies of similar morphological type in the field .",
    "however the morphological classifications in these studies are based on bulge - to - disk ratio , and it is not clear to what extent the results are affected by the variation of s0/s ratio from the field to the cluster ( see section [ cfcspirals ] below for further discussion ) .",
    "furthermore it is also increasingly evident that star formation in the spiral disks and in the circumnuclear region may have very different dependencies on environment ( cf .",
    "moss et al . 1998 ; hashimoto et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we have made an extensive survey of h@xmath0 emission as an indicator of the star formation rate in spirals in nearby clusters ( paper iii and references therein ) .",
    "one motivation is to understand how the cluster environment affects the evolution of spiral galaxies , including the dramatic depletion of cluster spirals over the past few giga - years .",
    "our survey technique can distinguish well between disk emission and circumnuclear starburst emission , and accordingly investigate how these vary with environment .",
    "in previous work we have discussed in detail a comparison between emission in field spirals and a single cluster , abell 1367 ( paper iii ) .",
    "here we utilise data for all 8 clusters in our sample , and do a comparable analysis for a full range of cluster types , discussing how emission varies across a range of environments of differing galaxy densities .",
    "we also attempt to differentiate the dependence of emission on local galaxy density from that on cluster type to give further insight into evolutionary mechanisms operating on cluster spirals .",
    "the paper is set out as follows . in section [ obs ]",
    "we describe the survey sample and summarise observational and emission detection methods .",
    "a previously unpublished list of emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) detected for 6 of the 8 surveyed clusters is given in section [ gprops ] .",
    "in this section we also consider the relation of emission to galaxy properties , and show that compact and diffuse emission detected on the prism plates can be well understood as circumnuclear starburst and normal disk emission respectively . in section [ cenviron ] , using a variety of cluster / field parameters , we show that there is a systematic enhancement of tidally - induced starburst emission with increasingly rich clusters .",
    "for the richest clusters this enhancement is greater than would be expected simply on the basis of increasing galaxy density alone .",
    "these observational results are discussed in section [ discuss ] , where we show that they provide convincing evidence that spirals have been transformed to s0s in clusters predominantly by tidal forces , a picture fully in accord with the most recent numerical simulations of clusters ( e.g. gnedin 1999 ) .",
    "we further discuss how the observational results can explain the apparently anomalous result for type ",
    "galaxy surface density relation found by dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for low richness clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "a summary of our results is given in section [ conclude ] .",
    "table [ clusters ] gives basic data for the 8 abell clusters in our survey ( abell 262 , 347 , 400 , 426 , 569 , 779 , 1367 , and 1656 ) .",
    "these clusters constitute a representative sample , comprising all but two of the 10 abell clusters in the northern hemisphere with redshifts less than @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ( the other two clusters , abell 189 and 194 , are both relatively poor clusters comparable to abell 262 , 347 , 569 and 779 ) .    our initial sample of galaxies comprised all cgcg galaxies ( zwicky et al .",
    "19601968 ) within 1.5 abell radii of the cluster centres ( 759 galaxies , where resolved double galaxies are counted as two ) .",
    "these galaxies were morphologically classified ( see section [ types ] ) and a subset defined which excluded galaxies with hubble types e , e / s0 , s0 , s0/a or galaxies of indeterminate type ( 292 galaxies remaining ) . a further 28 spirals falling beyond 1.5 abell radii",
    "were included ( 27 in abell 1367 , 1 in abell 400 ) , yielding a final total of 320 galaxies selected for the survey for h@xmath0 emission .",
    "our restriction to cgcg galaxies reflects the fact that our detection efficiency decreases sharply below the cgcg magnitude limit @xmath6 , and our exclusion of e , e / s0 , s0 , s0/a galaxies reflects the fact that in practice these hubble types are rarely detected in h@xmath0 ( see paper iii ) . in the case of double galaxies ,",
    "those 11 individual members fainter than 15.7 were excluded from the statistical sample , as were 15 galaxies which , for various reasons , were only visible on one of our two plates .",
    "thus , our final statistical sample represents a substantially complete group of potentially detectable star - forming galaxies in and around nearby abell clusters .",
    "cluster centres are taken from abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 ) .",
    "cluster mean redshifts , @xmath7 , and velocity dispersions , @xmath8 , based on a total of @xmath9 redshifts , are taken from struble & rood ( 1991 ) , where @xmath7 has been corrected to the centroid of the local group following rc2 ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) .",
    "the abell radius is defined ( abell 1958 ) as @xmath10 arcmin and corresponds to @xmath11 mpc where @xmath12 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "table [ plates ] gives basic information about the objective prism plates used for the survey , while figure [ fields ] shows the distribution of cgcg galaxies within the abell clusters as well as the objective prism plate boundaries ( see paper iii for abell 1367 ) .",
    "our survey technique and methods have been described in detail in paper i ( moss , whittle & irwin 1988 ) and to a lesser extent in papers ii and iii . here , we briefly review the methods .",
    "all plates were taken on the 61/94 cm burrell schmidt telescope at kitt peak in conditions of good seeing and transparency , and are consequently of good quality .",
    "the plates cover approximately @xmath13 at 94 arcsec @xmath14 and use an emulsion / filter combination of either or giving @xmath15  bandpass centered on 6655  with a peak sensitivity @xmath16 6717  .",
    "two prisms were used , either a high dispersion @xmath17 prism giving @xmath18  mm@xmath5 , or , when this became unavailable , a lower dispersion prism combination giving @xmath19  mm@xmath5 . in paper iii",
    "we compared the h@xmath0 detection efficiency of these two prism combinations and concluded that they were substantially equivalent .",
    "each cluster was observed twice , with the telescope east and west of the pier to reverse the dispersion direction .",
    "having two such plates not only ensures a more reliable detection of h@xmath0 , but also , from the difference in location of the emission , yields relatively accurate measurements of redshift .    using a low power binocular microscope ( @xmath20 ) , the galaxy spectra were inspected for signs of h@xmath0 emission , which appears as an h@xmath0 image superposed on the dispersed continuum spectrum .",
    "in paper iii we analysed the h@xmath0 sensitivity limit and found that the objective prism technique is 90% complete down to an equivalent width limit of @xmath21  for the h@xmath0+[nii ] blend , and @xmath22 efficient below this limit .",
    "table [ gsample ] gives the surveyed galaxies and h@xmath0 detections for seven clusters , while paper iii give these for the eighth , abell 1367 .",
    "our statistical analysis requires a range of parameters to characterise galaxy morphology , h@xmath0 emission , local environment , and more global environment .",
    "we list these parameters in table [ tparam ] together with their quantification as ranked and/or binned data suitable for the non - parametric statistical tests used below ( sections [ mags ] and following ) , and the sample number , @xmath9 , for each rank or bin .",
    "a more detailed description of individual parameters is as follows .      for each detected galaxy ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emission was graded for visibility on a 5 point scale ( s  strong ; ms  medium - strong ; m  medium ; mw  medium - weak ; and w  weak ) .",
    "similarly , the appearance of the h@xmath0 image was classified on a 5 point scale ( vc  very concentrated ; c  concentrated ; n  normal ; d  diffuse ; and vd  very diffuse ) .",
    "concentrated emission is much brighter than the underlying continuum and is sharply delineated from it ; diffuse emission is only slightly brighter than the continuum and has an indistinct appearance , and in general spans a larger region than the concentrated emission ( for further discussion , see paper ii ) .",
    "galaxies with double , multiple , or offset emission were categorised as compact emission , principally because of its high surface brightness .",
    "the combined mean emission classifications from each plate pair are listed in columns 12 and 13 of table [ gsample ] .",
    "we choose a binary rank for h@xmath0 detection , with no rank assigned for galaxies not satisfactorily surveyed for emission ( ` ? ' in table [ gsample ] ) .",
    "we also choose binary ranks for the h@xmath0 appearance , yielding two parameters : _ compact _ emission ( concentration classes vc , c , or n ) ; and _ diffuse _ emission ( concentration classes d or vd ) .",
    "astrophysically , we associate compact emission with a circumnuclear starburst , and diffuse emission with more normal ongoing disk - wide star formation .",
    "( for further discussion , see section [ gpdiscuss ] below . )",
    "because star formation rates depend quite sensitively on hubble type , it is important to estimate these types accurately , so that dependence on environment can be clearly distinguished from dependence on hubble type . unfortunately , at redshifts of @xmath23 km s@xmath5 the cluster galaxies are quite small and difficult to type accurately without good plate material . in the case of abell 1367",
    "we indeed have excellent plate material , and so used it to perform the typing of most of the cgcg galaxies in that cluster ( see paper iii ) . for the other clusters this is not the case , and we have adopted a somewhat more conservative approach to galaxy typing . for all ugc ( nilson 1973 ) galaxies",
    ", we adopt the ugc type . for non - ugc galaxies one of us ( mw ) classified the galaxies on the revised de vaucouleurs ( 1959 , 1974 )",
    "system using glass copies of the pss and direct iiiaj plates taken on the burrell schmidt .",
    "the reliability of these types was assessed in two ways .",
    "firstly , ugc galaxies were also typed and comparison with ugc types showed a standard deviation in the t class of @xmath24 .",
    "secondly , all galaxies were independently typed twice and showed similar level of agreement .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,^,^,^ , > \" , ]",
    "the analysis of the full cluster sample confirms earlier conclusions ( papers ii and iii ) that there is an enhancement of tidally - induced circumnuclear star formation in cluster galaxies ( types sa and later ) compared to similar galaxies in the field .",
    "whereas previous work established this simple contrast , the current work shows that the frequency of circumnuclear starbursts is consistent with a monotonic increase with increasingly dense cluster environments .",
    "figure [ scdistrib ] shows the increase in the fraction of spirals with compact emission with cluster rank , from the field ( rank 1 ) to the richest cluster ( coma , rank 6 ) , as well as with increasing local galaxy surface density , @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "we do _ not _ confirm the result from hashimoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that poor clusters have higher levels of starburst emission than either the field environment or rich clusters .",
    "in fact , the proportion of spirals with compact emission increases dramatically from the field ( @xmath16 8% ) to the richest cluster ( coma ; @xmath16 43% ) .",
    "there are corresponding increases in the fractions of spirals classed as peculiar ( @xmath16 2% in the field ; @xmath16 35% in coma ) , and those noted as disturbed ( @xmath16 11% in the field ; @xmath16 39% and 25% in abell 1367 and coma respectively ) .",
    "is it possible to integrate these findings into a broader picture ; one which addresses cluster evolution from intermediate redshifts to the present ? obviously , in a rich cluster such as coma the residual spiral fraction is much smaller than the spiral fractions in similar clusters at intermediate redshift .",
    "however , it appears from our study that _ the residual spiral population in nearby rich clusters is similar to the spiral population in clusters at intermediate redshift_. the butcher  oemler effect would appear to be mainly due to a _ decrease _ in the spiral population over the last few giga - years , not primarily a change in the properties of spirals themselves .",
    "the fraction of spirals in coma which are peculiar , show signs of interaction and distortion and which are undergoing tidally - induced star formation appears similar to the fraction of spirals which show these effects in rich clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "yet further evidence that tides and interactions are important in nearby clusters and not just in distant clusters has been given by conselice & gallagher ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors detect a variety of unusual fine - scale substructures , including distorted and interacting galaxies , in five nearby clusters which they consider to be caused by tidal forces .",
    "trentham & mobasher ( 1998 ) have discovered a giant low - surface - brightness arc of length @xmath16 80 mpc in the coma cluster , and regard fast encounters between nearby galaxies as the likeliest explanation of its properties .",
    "lavery & henry ( 1988 ) first proposed that the butcher  oemler effect could be explained as star formation triggered by galaxy  galaxy interactions in intermediate redshift clusters . a principal objection to this hypothesis was that the cluster velocity dispersion is typically too high ( @xmath16 1000 km s@xmath5 ) for strong tidal interactions to take place , since these require encounter speeds comparable to that of the galaxy rotation ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "however , there has been increasing observational evidence for tidal effects on galaxies both in nearby and intermediate redshift clusters as well as theoretical work supporting the possibility of strong tidal fields in clusters .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that within a few core radii of the centre of a rich cluster such as coma , tidal compression of a galaxy by the cluster potential can produce spiral arms and tidal tails and triggering of enhanced star formation ( e.g. byrd & valtonen 1990 ; valluri 1993 ; henrikson & byrd 1996 ) .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predict that fast close encounters with the central massive cluster galaxies will destroy many dwarf galaxies , and essentially transform spirals into ellipticals or dwarf spheroidals .",
    "all these simulations assume a fixed potential .",
    "however the potential of a real cluster is expected to vary continually during its evolution with collapse of the cluster to virialisation , and subsequent infall of additional material .",
    "gnedin ( 1999 ) has used self - consistent cluster simulations to demonstrate that this time - varying potential will cause a sequence of strong tidal shocks on an individual galaxy , comparable to those from massive galaxies . the shocks , which are likely to be produced by surviving groups of galaxies or large individual galaxies , take place over a wide region of the cluster , and enhance galaxy  galaxy interactions as well as amplifying galaxy merger rates . a galaxy in a cluster similar to that of abell richness class 0 or 1 at low redshift ,",
    "is predicted to have about 4 encounters closer than 10 kpc per hubble time , and have a probability of about 30% of being in a merger .",
    "these results suggest that profound effects on cluster galaxy morphology are to be expected from tidal forces during a hubble time .",
    "in particular , gnedin demonstrates that a likely consequence of tidal shocks is to turn a large fraction of normal spirals into s0s .",
    "this occurs by tidal heating of the disk which reduces gravitational instabilities and suppresses further star formation .",
    "gas is likely to be lost by ram - pressure stripping , interpenetrating encounters and , for low mass galaxies , being blown out by starbursts .",
    "these results thus suggest that the same tidal forces which we have identified as causing circumnuclear starbursts in nearby clusters ( and are evidently acting on cluster galaxies at intermediate redshifts ) , are the primary cause in transforming the spiral population in distant clusters into the s0 population in present day clusters .",
    "any mechanism for converting spirals to s0s is required to be more efficient with increasing galaxy density in order that it could account qualitatively for the galaxy type  surface density ( t@xmath1 ) relation found for clusters at @xmath2 and @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "dressler et al .",
    "as has been seen in section [ cfcomp ] above , the frequency of occurrence of tidally - induced starbursts increases with increasing galaxy surface density , which implies that tidal forces do indeed act more efficiently on galaxies in higher density regions .",
    "this confirms that these forces are a suitable mechanism to account , at least qualitatively , for the t@xmath1 relation in clusters .",
    "a further result , obtained in section [ cfcomp ] , is that the enhancement of tidally - induced starbursts in cluster spirals is not wholly accounted for simply by an increase of local galaxy density .",
    "in addition there is a ` cluster effect ' .",
    "a spiral in a cluster of higher central galaxy density is more likely to undergo such a starburst than a spiral in a region of similar local density in a cluster with a lower central galaxy density .",
    "this implies that , in regions of comparable local density , the transformation of spirals into s0s proceeds faster in clusters of higher concentration and/or higher richness .",
    "this result suggests a simple explanation of the apparently anomalous absence of a t@xmath1 relation found by dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for less concentrated , irregular clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) had found a significant t@xmath1 relation for galaxies in both centrally concentrated ` regular ' clusters and less concentrated , irregular clusters at @xmath25 , whereas by contrast dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a strong t@xmath1 relation only for regular clusters at @xmath2 . unlike their counterparts at @xmath25 , irregular clusters at @xmath2 have no significant t@xmath1 relation , and ellipticals in these clusters show no concentration to the densest regions",
    "this is understandable if there has not been enough time for a significant transformation of disk galaxy morphology to take place in irregular clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , such transformation would be expected for regular clusters at @xmath2 ( for which the timescale for transformation is shorter ) and for irregular clusters at @xmath25 ( for which a longer time duration for transformation is available ) .",
    "furthermore , the same galaxy  galaxy and galaxy  group interactions responsible for the transformation of spirals to s0s may also cause ellipticals to relax to the densest regions in clusters over similar timescales .",
    "thus our finding of a ` cluster effect ' in the enhancement of tidally - induced starbursts and the consequent inference , for regions of similar local density , of an accelerated transformation of spirals to s0s in clusters of higher central density together provide a natural explanation for the apparently anomalous absence of a t@xmath1 relation for galaxies in irregular clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "finally , one may ask what mechanism may accelerate the rate of galaxy encounters ( and consequent starburst activity ) , in clusters with greater central galaxy density ?",
    "the work by gnedin ( 1999 ) has shown that a time varying cluster potential will enhance such encounters .",
    "such a varying potential will arise both from cluster infall , and from subcluster mergers .",
    "recent x - ray studies of a number of clusters have shown asymmetric x - ray morphologies and temperature structures which are consistent with those seen in simulations of subcluster mergers ( e.g. henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; donnelly et al .",
    "1998 ; honda et al . 1996",
    "; henriksen , wang & ulmer 1999 ) , implying that these clusters are recent postmerger systems .",
    "furthermore , from a study of 10 distant clusters , wang & ulmer ( 1999 ) have shown that cluster global x - ray ellipticities correlate with their blue galaxy fractions .",
    "the strongly elongated clusters show substantial amounts of substructure , indicating that they are dynamically young systems , and leading wang & ulmer to suggest that the blue cluster galaxies originate in the process of cluster formation .",
    "the above results thus suggest that subcluster mergers may be a mechanism to drive an accelerated rate of galaxy encounters and tidally - induced starbursts ( and consequent morphological evolution of disk galaxies ) in more centrally concentrated clusters .",
    "one may suppose that such clusters have formed either as a result of subcluster mergers , or in higher density regions where the probability of such subcluster accretion is greater .",
    "the consequent accelerated rate of galaxy encounters and morphological evolution would account for a significant t@xmath1 relation for these clusters at @xmath26 as compared to the absence of such a relation for the ( presumably ) relatively isolated irregular clusters at the same redshift .    according to this picture , a significant enhancement of starburst activity above that normally expected for galaxies in a region of a given density ,",
    "is expected in clusters which are still undergoing the effects of subcluster merger . by contrast",
    "no such enhancement would be evident for clusters which are more relaxed .",
    "such a scenario is entirely consistent with the results of our survey .",
    "the two most centrally concentrated clusters in the survey , abell 1367 and coma both show evidence of being recent postmerger systems ( donnelly et al . 1998 ; honda et al . 1996 ) . and , in accord with the expectation for such systems , spiral galaxies in these clusters have been found to have an enhanced starburst activity as compared to spirals in regions of similar density in less concentrated clusters .",
    "from a survey of h@xmath0 emission in galaxies of types sa and later in 8 low - redshift abell clusters , we have shown that circumnuclear starbursts , most probably triggered by tidal interactions ( galaxy  galaxy , galaxy  group and galaxy  cluster ) , are more prevalent in spirals in denser regions and in clusters with a greater central galaxy density . in contrast to previous work , we find a monotonic increase in the fraction of spirals undergoing these starbursts from the field to higher density regions , and from clusters with low central galaxy density to clusters with high central density . there is a similar increase in the fraction of spirals classified as disturbed between the field and higher density environments , and between clusters of low and high central density . in the richest cluster studied ( coma ) , the fraction of spirals undergoing tidal distortion and/or tidally - induced star formation appears comparable to the fraction of spirals showing these effects in rich clusters at @xmath2 .    from these results",
    "it is suggested that tidal interactions are the primary mechanism for an on - going transformation of spirals to s0s in clusters , a scenario fully in accord with the most recent models of clusters with a non - static potential undergoing collapse and infall .",
    "this mechanism can qualitatively account for the type ",
    "local surface density ( t@xmath1 ) relation found in clusters on account of the higher efficiency of the mechanism in higher density regions .",
    "furthermore the prevalance of tidally - induced starbursts in spirals is found to depend not solely on local galaxy density , but also on cluster type .",
    "this implies that , for regions of comparable local density , transformation of spirals to s0s will take place faster in clusters with higher central density .",
    "this can account for the apparently anomalous lack of a t@xmath1 relation for irregular clusters at intermediate redshift .",
    "for these clusters there has not been time for significant morphological transformation of disk galaxies to have taken place in contrast to regular clusters at intermediate redshift ( for which the timescale for transformation is shorter ) and for low - redshift irregular clusters ( for which a longer time interval is available during which transformations may take place ) .",
    "moreover it is suggested that subcluster merging is a cause of the enhanced starburst activity ( and consequent accelerated morphological evolution of disk galaxies ) seen in the denser clusters , as compared to regions of similar density in less dense clusters .",
    "the two richest clusters in our survey show evidence of being recent postmerger systems , whose galaxies have such enhanced starburst activity , consistent with this picture .",
    "finally , the fraction of late - type galaxies which are classified as peculiar ( i.e. not in a recognisable stage of the hubble sequence ) also increases from the field to higher density environments , and from clusters of low to higher central density , in parallel with the increasing prevalance of tidally - induced starbursts in spirals . a very high fraction ( @xmath16 70% ) of these galaxies",
    "have emission similar to the starburst emission of spirals .",
    "it is suggested that these galaxies are predominantly on - going mergers , which are expected as the end product of some of the tidal interactions , and which are expected to be more common in regions of higher density and in clusters of higher central density due to the greater prevalence of tidal interactions in these locations .",
