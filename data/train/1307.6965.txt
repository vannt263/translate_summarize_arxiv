    "depressions of the total microwave flux discovered by @xcite and called ` negative bursts ' were interpreted by absorption in ejected filament material .",

    "the presumed association of microwave negative bursts with solar eruptions provides a basis for expectations to obtain additional information about eruptions and their parameters .",
    "a multi - spectral study of the 2004 july 13 solar event has led @xcite to an unexpected conclusion about an anomalous course of the filament eruption in this event . unlike a typical situation ,",
    "the eruptive filament after the initial rise apparently disintegrated into a large cloud of fragments , which dispersed over almost a quarter of the visible solar disk , and then mostly descended on the solar surface far from the eruption site .",
    "the dispersed filament material screened the background solar emission .",
    "the 2004 july 13 eruptive event has shown that in addition to screening compact sources important can be screening large quiet sun s areas .",
    "the absorption phenomena were manifest in a microwave negative burst being especially pronounced in a heii 304    image of soho / eit @xcite as a large darkening mismatching cme - related dimming observed in coronal extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) bands . among all of euv emission lines , in which observations are carried out , the heii 304  line is best suited for studies of prominences and filaments due to its temperature sensitivity range ( maximum at 80000 k ) .",
    "soho / eit produced heii 304    images usually once in 6 hours .",
    "we have not found in the literature descriptions of similar phenomena , except for the only report on the 2003 november 18 event @xcite , of which we were aware ( v.g . and",
    "i.c . were among the co - authors ) .",
    "a negative burst could not be observed in this event due to subsequent flaring .",
    "the event was studied in detail later @xcite .",
    "a review of @xcite does not mention such phenomena .",
    "a reason why anomalous eruptions were not well known previously seems to be clear . observations of eruptions in the h@xmath0 line are limited by the doppler shift , which rapidly removes absorbing features from the filter passband even with moderate line - of - sight velocities .",
    "observations in the heii 304    line were infrequent in the past .",
    "proceeding from the results of @xcite , we searched for i )  events with negative microwave bursts recorded in nobeyama and ussuriysk , and ii )  events , in which large darkenings were observed in 304    images .",
    "one more event with anomalous eruption , which occurred on 1998 april 29 around 17:30  ut , was revealed from eit data @xcite and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the events with negative bursts recorded at several frequencies were analyzed by using a simple model developed for estimating parameters of ejected material .",
    "the model allows one to calculate the spectrum of the total solar radio flux by considering contributions from the chromosphere , a screen constituted by material of an eruptive filament ` inserted ' into the corona at some height , and coronal layers both between the chromosphere and the screen , and between the screen and the observer @xcite . by comparing the frequency distribution of the microwave absorption depth in an observed negative burst with an absorption spectrum simulated with the model , it is possible to estimate the kinetic temperature of the screen , its optical thickness at each frequency , the area , and the height above the chromosphere .",
    "actual fluxes of compact sources were measured from norh images and used among other input parameters of the model in the simulations .    the studies of ( ) and @xcite presented several events with negative bursts detected mostly from measurements with norp and rt-2 ( 2.8 ghz ) in ussuriysk @xcite and some events with a large darkening in 304    images .",
    "the estimated parameters are consistent with the assumption about screening of the solar emission by cool material of an eruptive filament . among these events ,",
    "there were also those with anomalous eruptions .",
    "@xcite concluded that magnetic reconnection was most likely implicated in the observed transformation of the eruptive filament , but a particular role of reconnection and a possible scenario of such an anomalous eruption remained unclear .",
    "noticeable negative bursts were recently observed in two very different events .",
    "the 2011 june 7 event was associated with a powerful flare and strong impulsive microwave burst .",
    "the 2011 december 13 event has not produced any detectable enhancement in total flux records .",
    "we firstly analyze the two recent events",
    ". then we present a possible scenario of an anomalous eruption and discuss distinctive particularities and possible common properties of such events . on the basis of these considerations and results of previous studies we endeavor to supplement a systematic view of solar eruptions associated with negative bursts .",
    "our analysis of events with microwave negative bursts uses total flux measurements at several frequencies routinely carried out with the following instruments :    * the nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp , @xcite ) ; we use data at the frequencies of 1 , 2 , 3.75 , 9.4 , and 17 ghz ; * the radiometers of the learmont station of the usaf rstn network ; we use data at the frequencies of 1.4 , 2.7 , 5.0 , and 8.8 ghz ; * the rt-2 radiometer observing at 2.8 ghz @xcite operated by the ussuriysk astrophysical observatory ( station code ` voro ' )",

    "the 2011 december 13 event considered here presents an interesting rare extremity of an isolated negative burst .",
    "anomalous eruption of a filament with its disintegration appears to evidence reconnection between magnetic fields of the large - scale coronal environment and interior of the filament . in such a case",
    ", the signs of the magnetic helicity must not coincide for the ejected magnetic cloud and the active region from which the eruption originated @xcite .",
    "an anomalous eruption presumably occurs if an eruptive filament passes through vicinities of a coronal null point .",
    "one of possible scenarios of an event with an anomalous eruption was proposed here .",
    "as shown , parameters of ejected plasma projected onto the solar disk can be estimated from multi - frequency total flux records of negative bursts .",
    "ongoing observations with norp and norh along with euv data can shed further light on different scenarios and parameters of solar eruptions and can be used among the factors in forecasting geoeffectiveness of earth - directed magnetic clouds .",
    "being associated with eruptions on the earth - facing solar surface , microwave negative bursts indicate events , in which potentially geoeffective cmes develop .",
    "especially hazardous can be anomalous eruptions , whereas occurrence of negative bursts in such events is not guaranteed .",
    "the most demonstrative example is the anomalous eruption of 2003 november 18 responsible for the strongest geomagnetic storm in last two decades @xcite , but a negative burst could not be detected in this event due to ongoing flaring .",
    "similarly , the negative burst on 2003 may 28 was interrupted by a subsequent flare .",
    "microwave imaging observations are very important also in this respect .",
    "importance of anomalous eruptions also calls for such requirements for future radio telescopes as multi - frequency capability at long microwaves with a field of view excessively covering the solar disk .    acknowledgements .",
