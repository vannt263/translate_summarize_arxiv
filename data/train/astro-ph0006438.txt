    "the monte carlo scheme takes full advantage of the undisputed physical knowledge of the secular evolution of ( spherical ) star clusters as inferred from continuum model simulations .",
    "additionally , it describes in a proper way the graininess of the gravitational field and the stochasticity of the real @xmath0body systems and provides as detailed as in direct @xmath0body simulations information about movement of any objects in the system .",
    "this does not include any additional physical approximations or assumptions which are common in fokker  planck and gas models ( for e.g. conductivity ) .",
    "because of this , the monte carlo scheme can be regarded as a method which lies between direct @xmath0body and fokker  planck models and combines most of their advantages .",
    "moreover , monte carlo codes are simple , very fast , easily parallelized and easily scalable to the physical units .",
    "there is no need for special hardware or supercomputers to efficiently simulate evolution of realistic star clusters .",
    "however , as any numerical method , the monte carlo method suffers from some disadvantages .",
    "it can only deal with spherically symmetrical systems , and only small  angle two  body interactions .",
    "the galactic tidal field can only be approximated by the tidal cut - off , and unfortunately , cross  sections for some physical processes are needed ( e.g. three ",
    "body binary formation ) . additionally , the physical processes , which evolve on time  scales comparable to the crossing time ",
    "scale , can not be properly investigated , and the method has difficulty with the proper definition of local parameters ( e.g. density , velocity dispersion ) . despite all of these disadvantages the monte carlo method can be easily and efficiently used to simulate evolution of realistic globular clusters .",
    "the comparison between numerical simulations and observations will help to infer the initial parameters of proto  clusters and help to disentangle the interplay between physical processes involved in cluster evolution .",
    "moreover , the monte carlo method can be used to simulate dynamical formation of massive black holes in dense spherical stellar systems ( e.g. galactic nuclei ) .",
    "the monte carlo code is described in detail in giersz ( 1998 ) , which deals with simulations of isolated single  mass systems .",
    "here and in giersz ( 2000 ) the monte carlo code is extended to include the following additional physical processes :    * multi  mass systems described by the power ",

    "see columns labeled by g and h-0.1 in table 1",
    ". only models with a flat mass function show some disagreement .",
    "these models are difficult for both methods .",
    "violent stellar evolution and induced strong tidal striping lead to troubles with time  scaling for the @xmath0-body model and proper determination of the tidal radius for the monte carlo model . generally , the same is true for monte carlo models of family 1 .",
    "results of these models show good agreement with results of cw , aarseth & heggie ( 1998 ) and takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1999 ) .",
    "jnr s results , particularly for strongly concentrated systems , disagree with all other models .",
    "this can be connected with the fact , that jnr s monte carlo scheme is not particularly suitable for high central density and strong density contrast .",

    "the rate of mass loss , evolution of the central potential , evolution of the average mass does not depend much on the initial central concentration of the system .",
    "they depend strongly on the index of the mass function",
    ". models of family 1 , on the contrary show , as well , dependence on the initial concentration .",
    "very high initial mass loss across the tidal boundary , connected with evolution of the most massive stars ( for models of family 1 , there are more massive stars than for standard models ) , forces the system to substantial changes of its structure and in consequence to different evolution of the total mass , anisotropy , etc .. models which are quickly disrupted show only small signs of mass segregation .",
    "models with larger central concentration survive the phase of rapid mass loss and then undergo core collapse and subsequent post  collapse expansion in a manner similar to isolated models . the expansion phase is eventually reversed when tidal limitation becomes important . as in isolated models ,",
    "mass segregation substantially slows down by the end of the core collapse .",
    "after a core bounce there is a substantial increase in the mean mass in the middle and outer parts of the system , caused by the preferential escape of stars of low mass and tidal effects .",
    "standard models , which are not quickly disrupted , show modest initial build up of anisotropy in the outer parts of the system . as the tidal stripping exposes inner parts of the system ,",
    "anisotropy gradually decreases and eventually becomes slightly negative .",
    "the central part of the system stays nearly isotropic .",
    "models of family 1 , from the very beginning , develop in the outer parts of the system modest negative anisotropy .",
    "it stays negative until the time of cluster disruption , when it becomes slightly positive ( during cluster disruption most stars are on radial orbits ) .",
    "for the first time , the monte carlo simulation , on the `` star  by  star '' bases , of evolution of 1,000,000 body star cluster is presented . the initial conditions were as follows : total mass equal to @xmath23 , tidal radius equal to @xmath24 , power  low index of mass function equal to @xmath25 , minimum and maximum mass equal to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively and king model parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the 1,000,000 body run shows basically the same features as , discussed above , models of family @xmath4 1 . as an example of the overall cluster evolution the time dependence of lagrangian radii , core radius and tidal radius are presented in figure 1 .",
    "the three different phases of evolution can be clearly distinguished .",
    "first , short phase of violent mass loss due to stellar evolution leads to overall cluster expansion .",
    "even the innermost lagrangian radius expands , the contraction connected with mass segregation is not strong enough to dominate the expansion .",
    "second phase is characterized by the slow core collapse .",
    "tidal effects are small and cluster behaves in a similar way as an ordinary isolated system . then in the third phase , post  collapse evolution is superposed with growing tidal striping effects",
    ". the cluster nearly homogeneously contracts .",
    "the central parts of the system show clear signs of the gravothermal oscillations .    in figure 2",
    "the density profiles for the different epochs are presented .",
    "it is clear , that in the central parts of the system the density profile shows steeper slope than @xmath29 ( line labeled by 6 ) , the standard value for single  mass systems .",
    "this is in agreement with results of cw .",
    "the power ",
    "low index is a function of the ratio of mass of the most massive stars to the average mass .",
    "the larger the ratio the smaller the power  law index .",
    "the core is mainly populated by the most massive stars ( massive white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes ) , whose masses are larger than the average mass in the vicinity of the core .",
    "so as a consequence , the power  law index is smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "the density profiles for an advanced collapse phase ( lines labeled by 4 , 5 and 6 ) show a bump in the middle part of the system ( close to @xmath30 in x  axis ) .",
    "the bump originates because of the growing influence of low mass stars on the determination of the local density .",
    "the position and the size of the bump is in a good agreement with fokker ",
    "planck results ( takahashi & lee 2000 ) .    in order to perform simulations of real globular clusters several additional physical effects have to be included into the code .",
    "the tidal shock heating of the cluster due to passages through the galactic disk , interaction with the bulge , shock  induced relaxation , primordial binaries , physical collisions between single stars and binaries are one of them .",
    "inclusion of all these processes do not pose a fundamental theoretical or technical challenge .",
    "it will allow to perform detailed comparison between simulations and observed properties of globular clusters and will help to understand the globular cluster formation conditions and explain how peculiar objects observed in clusters can be formed .",
    "these kinds of simulations will also help to introduce , in a proper way , into future @xmath0body simulations all necessary processes to simulate on the star  by ",
    "star basis evolution of real globular clusters from their birth to death .",
    "i would like to thank douglas c. heggie for making the @xmath0body results of standard model simulations available ."
