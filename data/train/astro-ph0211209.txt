    "recently , the presence of massive black holes ( mbhs , with masses from a few @xmath2 to a few @xmath3 ) in the center of non - active galaxies has received considerable observation support , mainly from the kinematics of stars or gas in the center - most region of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "one of the most convincing cases is the milky way for which the motion of individual stars can be observed , both along the line of sight or perpendicular to it @xcite . they orbit a dark mass of @xmath4 whose extent is less than 0.001pc and coincides with the radio source sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "these mbhs reside at the center of stellar clusters whose densities may exceed @xmath5 @xcite . an exciting consequence of this is the possibility for a star to be captured onto a relativistic orbit around the mbh by emission of gravitational radiation @xcite . for a source at a distance of a few hundreds of mpc and a mbh s mass in the range between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the frequency of these waves will enter _ lisa _ s range as the orbit shrinks down @xcite .",
    "if it withstands the tidal forces , the star will eventually find itself on an unstable , plunging orbit and disappear through the bh s horizon .",
    "the computation of the late , strong - field , phases of this inspiral requires full general relativistic treatment and can not be handled with tools presently available ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless when the pericenter distance , @xmath8 is still well beyond the stability limit ( @xmath9 for a circular orbit around a non - rotating bh , with @xmath10 the gravitational constant , @xmath11 the bh s mass and @xmath12 the speed of light ) , approximate methods can be used to determine how the orbit evolves through emission of gravitational waves . for a star with mass @xmath13 on an initial orbit of semi - major axis @xmath14 and high eccentricity , @xmath15 , the time to plunge is approximately @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the initial pericenter distance .",
    "compact stars , i.e. white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) or stellar black holes ( sbhs ) spiral all the way down to the horizon but a main sequence star ( mss ) is torn apart by the tidal gravitational field of the mbh at a distance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radius of the star , @xmath20 its average density and @xmath21 , a constant of order unity , depends on the stellar structure @xcite .",
    "hence a mss may come close enough to the mbh to emit significant amounts of gravitation radiation only if it is compact enough .",
    "note that @xmath20 is maximum for @xmath22 , at the transition to brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we only consider quadrupolar gravitational radiation because it dominates energy and angular momentum losses . in the weak field approximation and neglecting the gravitational influence of other stars , the orbit may be treated as a keplerian ellipse whose parameters slowly change as a result of emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the latter is emitted at integer multiples of the orbital frequency , @xmath23 . at a distance @xmath24 from the source ,",
    "the strain amplitude in the @xmath25 harmonic is @xmath26 where the non - dimensional factor @xmath27 is an intricate function of @xmath28 and the eccentricity @xmath29 @xcite . for simplicity , we consider the the _ rms amplitude _ , averaged over @xmath30 and @xmath31 polarizations and all directions .",
    "we assume that a star is irremediably captured by the mbh if it gets on an orbit with a time scale for shrinkage by emission of gravitational radiation shorter than the time over which 2-body relaxation could significantly modify the pericenter distance , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is the usual relaxation time @xcite and @xmath34 is the angle between the trajectory and the direction to the center .",
    "the typical eccentricity of capture orbits may be estimated from the condition @xmath35 : @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is a typical velocity for stars in the `` cusp '' , i.e. the central region of the cluster where the kinematics is dominated by the gravitational attraction of the mbh .",
    "@xmath38 , of order @xmath39 , is the total stellar mass in this region .",
    "the rate of capture is controlled by processes that send stars onto these extremely elongated orbits . in a spherical cluster ,",
    "the most important one is 2-body relaxation .",
    "to compute capture rates , many difficulties have to be faced , in particular the role of mass segregation , stellar collisions or tidal disruptions . although these complications can be included to some extent into analytical computations @xcite , the intricate nature of the problem calls for numerical simulations .",
    "we have recently developed a new monte carlo ( mc ) code to follow the long term evolution of galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "this tool is based on the scheme proposed by @xcite to simulate globular clusters but , in addition to relaxation , it also includes collisions , tidal disruptions , stellar evolution and captures .    for this work",
    ", we devised a model which represents the central cluster of our galaxy .",
    "it is an @xmath40-model @xcite .",
    "the stellar density is @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( total stellar mass ) and @xmath45pc .",
    "the central bh has a mass of @xmath46 .",
    "these quantities were chosen to provide a good agreement with the observed run of the enclosed mass around sgr  a@xmath0 as a function of the distance and the star counts @xcite , while imposing @xmath47 , a relatively large ratio chosen for the sake of resolution .",
    "we assume all stars formed @xmath48years ago with a `` universal '' initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath49 with @xmath50 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , 1.3 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 and 2.3 up to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we do not include giant stars .",
    "all wds , nss and sbhs are assumed to have 0.6 , 1.4 and 7@xmath56 , respectively .",
    "there is no initial mass segregation .",
    "the number of particles for our main simulation is @xmath57 , so that each particle represents 65.5 stars .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : capt]a , we show the capture rates as a function of time . as captures are rare , we have integrated the evolution of the nucleus over many billion years to improve statistics . however , over such a long time scale , the nucleus model experiences a relatively important evolution .",
    "most notably , significant mass segregation occurs . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "the density is dominated by sbhs ( which represent only 2% of the stellar mass ) in the region interior to @xmath58pc while the density of msss has decreased from a steep @xmath59 to a milder @xmath60 peak .",
    "this explains the steady decrease in the mss capture rate .",
    "given its efficiency , mass segregation should in principle be introduced from the beginning of the simulation , which is unfortunately impossible for lack of observational constrains and adequate cluster models .",
    "anyway , it is clear that the predicted mss capture rate is in excess of @xmath61 and may be as high as a few @xmath62 . for wds ,",
    "the rate is a few @xmath63 and around @xmath64 for nss and sbhs .",
    "these latter values are based on a small number of events and have low statistical significance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : capt](b ) , the initial orbital parameters are reported for all captures .",
    "one sees that orbits are very elongated , as predicted , with very small pericentre distances .",
    "previous , analytical , studies did not address the capture of msss .",
    "they predicted a wd capture rate ranging from @xmath65 @xcite to @xmath63 @xcite . explaining why these estimates are different from each other and from our result is beyond the scope of this letter as it would require a lengthy discussion of the different nucleus models and various treatments of the physics in these papers .",
    "we note that our wd rate is similar but larger than that of @xcite while these authors predict an initial sbh capture rate some three orders of magnitude larger than ours !",
    "during the course of the mc simulations , captured stars are immediately removed from the cluster .",
    "their initial orbital parameters being known , we come back to this data and compute the inspiralling and concomitant gravitational waves emission @xcite . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampl ] , we plot the evolution of the frequency and amplitude of the lowest five harmonics of the emitted waves for typical wd and mss events",
    ". the wd would be detectable during a few @xmath2years and the mss for nearly @xmath66years .",
    "nss and a sbhs typically have shorter detectability durations . multiplying these times by the respective capture rates ,",
    "one gets rough estimates for the expected average number of _ lisa _ sources at the galactic center .",
    "however , the mc data permits more precise determinations through the following method . for each event @xmath67",
    ", we computed the evolution of the 20 first harmonics of the rms amplitude and selected at each time the one with the highest _ lisa _ signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . then we compute @xmath68 , the time during which there is a harmonic with snr larger than @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we get the expected number of sources with a harmonic component stronger than snr @xmath69 by summation , @xmath70 the summation is realized over all the @xmath71 events that occurred during some given time interval @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : sourcesnumber ] is the result of this computation . to have reasonable statistics , we set @xmath73yrs for msss and wds and @xmath74yrs for nss and sbhs .",
    "the most striking results concern msss . even though complete tidal disruption has been assumed when the particle reaches @xmath75 ,",
    "the predicted number of sources with @xmath76 is of order 3 - 5 . if sources with snr of 3 can be detected , then _",
    "lisa _ should be able to observe of order 10 msss orbiting the sgr  a@xmath0 mbh . note that for such long - lived sources , the snr is proportional to the square root of the mission duration , likely to exceed one year .",
    "a major concern regarding this result is the role of tidal interactions which may enter the game before they are strong enough to disrupt a star in a single passage .",
    "tides are raised at each pericentre passage , converting some orbital energy into stellar pulsation .",
    "these oscillations dampen into heat through mechanisms and on time scales that are still uncertain @xcite .",
    "conservatively , we assume complete dissipation , thus disregarding the possibility of energy being transfered back from the oscillations to the orbital motion at next periastron passage , and ineffective radiation of this energy .",
    "the ratio of the amount of energy to be dissipated ( either by gravitational waves or tides ) to reach a relativistic detectable orbit , to the star s self - binding energy is of order @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the escape velocity from the stellar surface .",
    "consequently , with our assumptions , tidal dissipation can not influence the orbit without first strongly affecting the stellar structure .",
    "hence , to get a ( over)estimate of the impact of tidal interactions in reducing the expected number of detectable stars , we computed for all capture events the tidal energy pumped into the star at each periastron passage , assuming @xmath79 and using the @xmath80 polytrope model from @xcite .",
    "when the accumulted energy reached 20% of the self - binding energy , the star was considered disrupted .",
    "recomputing @xmath81 with this pessimistic procedure , we still get of order 0.52 and 48 mss sources with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcesnumber ] .",
    "we conclude that tidal interactions can potentialy reduce the number of sources significantly but probably not supress them completely .",
    "we have tested the robustness of our result to several other aspects of the modeling , through a series of lower resolution simulations ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "interestingly , our conclusions are not affected if we assume a constant stellar formation rate during the @xmath85years preceding the beginning of the simulation",
    ". observations of the arches cluster , close to the galactic center , are hinting to an imf exponent of @xmath86 for @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "if we adopt @xmath88 for stars more massive stars than @xmath89 , the capture rate is slightly lower . with the extreme assumption that @xmath88 above @xmath54 , a very sbh - rich population is formed .",
    "after a few billion years , they dominate the central pc from which they have expelled most of the msss whose capture rate is reduced by a factor of 3",
    ". modifications of the low - mass part of the imf have direct consequences because only stars less massive than @xmath90 may be detected before tidal disruption .",
    "the imfs with the largest or lowest proportion of low mass stars that are still compatible with local observations @xcite lead to a number of predicted mss sources higher by 40 - 80% , respectively lower by of order 25% .",
    "only low mass msss contribute as more massive but less denser ones suffer from early tidal disruption .",
    "hence , the mss signal would be too weak to be detected from distant galaxies",
    ". a ms source would only be marginally detectable during of order @xmath91 years if located in the virgo cluster which is too short to ensure a significant detection probability .",
    "local group galaxies are probably ruled out as well .",
    "the bh at the center of m  31 has a mass of a few @xmath7 so that the frequency of gravitational waves would be too low .",
    "detailed simulations for m  32 yield a probability for a ms source with snr above 1 of order 0.30.5 only .",
    "if massive bhs are present in dwarf galaxies or globular clusters @xcite and their masses follow the well known correlation with the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy @xcite , they impose too intense tidal forces in their vicinity .",
    "to summarize , captured msss should be detected at the galactic center , many @xmath2 years before plunge , but all other sources are predicted to be compact remnants in galaxies at distances of a few hundreds of mpc , during the last few months or years of inspiral .    the draft of this paper has been written during a visit to princeton university observatory thanks to the hospitality of laurent eyer .",
    "this work was realized under a grant from the swiss national science foundation .",
    "complementary support from nasa under grant nag5 - 10707 is acknowledged .",
    "the author expresses his gratitude to kostas glampedakis who provided the routines to compute the orbital evolution , to sterl phinney for interesting discussions and to scott a. hughes and tal alexander for useful comments on the draft of this paper ."
