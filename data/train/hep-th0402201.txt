    "the duality between type iib string theory and m - theory , as an indispensable component of the string / m - theory web , _  la _ schwarz and aspinwall @xcite , has two characteristic features : first there is a generalized t - duality between iib theory on a circle and m - theory one a two - torus . according to this duality ,",
    "the winding modes of the fundamental / d - string bound states ( fd - string ) in the iib spectrum are dualized to kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes in m - theory .",
    "secondly the non - perturbative @xmath1 symmetry in iib theory is geometrized to be the modular group of the two - torus in m - theory .",
    "the physical ideas behind this duality are elegant and beautiful , but how to formulate them in an explicit formalism and in a constructive way remains a challenge .    to our knowledge , up to now",
    "the only way available to formulate m - theory microscopically is the bfss matrix theory @xcite .",
    "( for other attempts to formulate the notion of the so - dubbed ",
    "protean degrees of freedom \" of m - theory , see the review @xcite . ) in this framework the statement for the non - perturbative iib / m duality is that matrix theory compactified on a two - torus , with the size of the torus shrinking to zero , is dual to iib string theory in a flat background @xcite . however , it is highly non - trivial to see how this can come about .",
    "matrix theory has nine transverse dimensions ; when two of them are compactified and shrink to vanishing size , only seven dimensions survive .",
    "one needs to have the eighth transverse dimension in iib string theory emerging in this limit .",
    "this emergent dimension should have two crucial properties in conformity with the iib / m duality .",
    "first before decompactification the kk modes along it have to be associated with the membrane wrapping states on the torus in matrix theory .",
    "secondly after decompactification it should be on the same footing as other transverse dimensions , sharing an eight dimensional rotational invariance .",
    "since the compactified matrix theory is formulated as a @xmath0-dimensional super yang - mills theory ( sym@xmath2 ) on the dual torus , iib / m(atrix ) duality is addressed in the language of sym in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the wrapping membranes are argued to correspond to configurations of the yang - mills fields , with nonvanishing ( abelian ) magnetic flux , which gives the wrapping number . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotational symmetry between the decompactified emergent dimension and other flat transverse ones in the iib target space , is argued to be related to the ( conjectured ) electric - magnetic ( em ) duality of the @xmath3-dimensional sym , resulting from matrix theory compactified on a three - torus .",
    "though these intuitive sym arguments are compelling , an explicit construction of the wrapping membrane , as well as the definition of its wrapping number , is in demand in either the compactified matrix theory or in the dual @xmath0-dimensional sym @xcite .",
    "certainly one would prefer a more direct approach without the detour into the em - duality in the three - dimensional world - volume of sym .",
    "moreover , iib / m(atrix ) duality has been addressed only for the rectangular tori .",
    "no serious attempts have been made to formulate the notion of `` dual torus '' of _ generic shape_.    to fill the gap , in our previous work in this series @xcite , we tried to generalize the definition of the wrapping number for a continuous map between two tori to matrix states wrapping on the compactified torus .",
    "we first adopted the deconstruction techniques @xcite to approximate the compactified torus by a sequence of orbifolds , that encode the geometric information of a _ rectangular _ torus .",
    "this resulted in a quiver matrix quantum mechanics , whose continuum limit gives rise to sym@xmath2 .",
    "then the wrapping matrix states were constructed explicitly in the quiver matrix mechanics framework in terms of fractional powers of the t hooft clock and shift matrices . and it has been checked that this construction possesses all properties required by the iib / m duality .",
    "the present paper is sequential to the previous one , to study the case in which the compactified torus is of _ generic _ shape .",
    "our motivation is to better understand how the _ generic _ geometry of the _ dual torus _ is encoded in the discrete setting of deconstruction ( based on the orbifolding approach ) , and how a continuous geometry is restored on the sym world - volume in the continuum limit .",
    "we shall refine the formalism for the fractional powers of matrices by employing a functional calculus of dunford , to construct matrix membrane states with a well - defined topological wrapping number .",
    "then , the generalized ( torus - circle ) t - duality is verified for generic moduli of the torus on a rigorous ground . as a bonus",
    ", we shall gain some insights into the @xmath1 duality by identifying the fd - string in m - theory and eliminating the unwanted degeneracy in the membrane wrapping states in a satisfying fashion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section_orb ] , we describe in detail the matrix theory on @xmath4 orbifold , which is our starting point , in the form of quiver matrix mechanics . in sec .",
    "[ section_dec ] , we ( de)construct in the large @xmath5 limit the toroidal world - volume geometry with generic moduli , with a @xmath0-dimensional sym defined on it , which recovers matrix theory compactification on a dual torus .",
    "moreover , we are able to identify the projection of the @xmath3-dimensional sym involved in previous discussions in the literature on iib / m(atrix ) duality . since the geometric information of the target torus is ( re)constructed from the orbifold data , this results in a precise formulation of the duality between the target torus and the world - volume torus of sym . in sec .",

    "first the geometry setting is the orbifold @xmath4 , in which a discretized torus is `` embedded '' even at finite @xmath5 . on the one hand , the collective motion of d - particles in the angular directions on this orbifold may develop a ( regularized ) wrapping membrane , which are described by fractional powers of the clock and shift matrices .",
    "our quiver matrix mechanics governs the dynamics of the wrapping configurations .",
    "the wrapping modes develop a kaluza - klein tower , giving rise to the generalized t - duality and iib / m(atrix ) duality . on the other hand , by deconstruction of d - particle states ,",
    "the dual torus emerges in target space and @xmath116-dimensional sym emerges in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "this deconstruction procedure also reveals a ( hidden ) underlying @xmath118-dimensional sym , which plays a vital role in the literature of iib / m(atrix ) theory duality .",
    "our analysis of iib / m duality concentrates mainly on the spectroscopy , leaving for the future research of the deduction of an effective theory from sym as well as the relation between yang - mills coupling and iib coupling . a spectroscopic discussion of wrapping membrane is also given in @xcite , where @xmath281 is taken to be the base space .",
    "we only note that to get the correct chirality of iib fermions from the matrix theory is highly nontrivial .",
    "the deconstruction technique has been widely employed in string community , for examples see @xcite ; more comprehensive discussion on compactification in various dimensions , especially on m5-brane , can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for intersectional m5-brane ) . as we noted before , the main technical difficulty that we have overcome is to construct the matrix membrane states wrapping on the orbifold .",
    "our formalism of fractional powers of clock and shift matrices has a natural connection with fractional membrane , of which early intuition can be traced to @xcite .",
    "we have applied our approach to both iia / m and iib / m dualities . while iia / m duality is now a somewhat common exercise ,",
    "the success of our quiver matrix mechanics approach in demonstrating iib / m duality shows its powerfulness in dealing with non - perturbative aspects of string theory , in contrast to the inaptitute of compactified matrix theory to incorporate the wrapping matrix membrane states .",
