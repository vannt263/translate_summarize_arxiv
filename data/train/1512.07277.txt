    "the semiprojective @xmath0-algebras ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) are of paramount importance in the study of classification and structure of @xmath0-algebras , but in spite of decades of interest many basic questions about this class remain open . in this paper",
    ", we study semiprojectivity in the context of graph @xmath0-algebras and completely resolve the question of when a unital such algebra is semiprojective .",
    "the theory of the class of graph @xmath0-algebras plays a prominent role in our understanding of semiprojectivity , and in fact , until a recent announcement by enders ( @xcite ) , the only known examples of nuclear and simple @xmath0-algebras were corners of graph algebras .",
    "indeed , as detailed below , a complete understanding of semiprojectivity for unital graph @xmath0-algebras very easily leads to the resolution , in the negative , of two long - standing conjectures by blackadar concerning closure properties of the class of semiprojective @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the fact that all simple and unital graph algebras are semiprojective was proved by szymaski by a refinement of methods in blackadar s proof that @xmath1 is semiprojective . refining the argument further",
    ", spielberg extended this result to all simple graph algebras with finitely generated @xmath2-theory .",
    "since all of these results draw on the fact that in purely infinite @xmath0-algebras all projections are properly infinite it is not surprising that our analysis of the general unital case draws heavily on the notion of properly infinite projections .",
    "in fact , we will prove in theorem [ thm : finite ] and theorem [ thm : finiteii ]      a.   @xmath7 is semiprojective b.   @xmath7 is weakly semiprojective c.   @xmath7 is weakly semiprojective w.r.t . the class of unital graph @xmath0-algebras d.   for each @xmath8 , @xmath9 does not have ( fq ) e.   for each @xmath8 , @xmath10 is properly infinite",
    ". f.   any corner @xmath11 with @xmath12 is semiprojective g.   for any gauge - invariant ideal @xmath13 , any corner @xmath14 with @xmath15 is semiprojective h.   no pair of gauge - invariant ideals @xmath16 has @xmath17 morita equivalent to @xmath18 or @xmath19",
    "we will return to the property ( fq ) mentioned in ( iv ) below , and draw first the reader s attention to condition ( v ) which reduces the issue of semiprojectivity to the question of whether or not certain projections are properly infinite .",
    "note also that property ( viii ) reduces the _ a priori _ global question of semiprojectivity to the local question of having a subquotient of a certain size to be of a special form . since in general semiprojectivity passes neither to ideals or quotients ,",
    "this is a highly surprising result which we discovered only after substantial computer experimentation had convinced us that is was likely true .",
    "the other statements compare semiprojectivity to weak semiprojectivity and semiprojectivity of corners , proving that all these notions coincide .    to prove theorem [ main ] , and to provide a concrete test for semiprojectivity which may be completely automated",
    ", we must study the question of which projections in graph algebras are properly infinite . to answer this question",
    "we must resolve the relation between various notions of infinity of projections as studied by rrdam , and it turns out that in this case many of the general complications shown by him to exist even in simple @xmath0-algebras do not occur .",
    "in fact , we provide the following dichotomies      a.   either @xmath20 is infinite , or for any surjection @xmath21 , @xmath22 is stably finite b.   either @xmath20 is properly infinite , or for some surjection @xmath21 , @xmath22 is nonzero and stably finite    which hold true also in the non - unital case .",
    "we prove these results in proposition [ dichoi ] and theorem [ thm : notpi : pre ] below , establishing first ( i ) by a concrete criterion for testing infinity of projections @xmath23 associated to finite sets of vertices @xmath24 , and extending our findings to general projections using the recent understanding of the non - stable @xmath2-theory of graph algebras in @xcite and @xcite . with this",
    ", ( ii ) follows by appealing to the general description of proper infiniteness obtained by kirchberg and rrdam .",
    "however , in order to perform the necessary analysis of semiprojectivity , a concrete criterion for which vertex projections @xmath23 are properly infinite is required , and drawing on ( ii ) above we provide the criterion that @xmath25 must not have the condition ( fq ) to the effect that none of the configurations illustrated in figure [ fqfig ] may be found . the details will be given below , but the general idea of the three kinds of configurations which are indicative of the failure of proper infiniteness is that one or several vertices @xmath26 or @xmath27 have the property that save a possible unique loop based on @xmath26 in the subscase ( tq ) , there is at least one , but at most a finite number of paths starting at @xmath26 and ending in @xmath25 .",
    "in the subcase ( mq ) one further must require that the @xmath26 is a singular vertex of the graph , and in the subcase ( aq ) a whole sequence of such @xmath27 must be provided .       as seen in @xcite , any unital graph algebra with a single non - trivial ideal which is af is isomorphic to a graph algebra given by @xmath28&\\bullet\\ar[r]&\\cdots\\ar[r]&\\bullet\\ar@{=>}[r]&\\circ\\ar[r]&\\bullet\\ar[r]&\\cdots\\ar[r]&\\bullet}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 edges to the left of the infinite emitter and @xmath30 edges to the right of the infinite reciever .",
    "there are many graph @xmath0-algebras with precisely two non - trivial ideals which are neither af nor semiprojective .",
    "one example is given by the graph given by @xmath31 $ ] from example [ alltwobytwo ] .",
