    "it is well - known that in systems having dimension @xmath10 greater than the upper critical dimension @xmath11 , fluctuations in thermal equilibrium near critical phase transitions are well described by the mean - field theory @xcite . for simple",
    "ising - like spin models , the value of upper critical dimension is known to be @xmath12 . in this paper , we give an example of a lattice , whose effective dimension is infinite , and the exact solution of the spherical model on the lattice shows that while the critical exponents are correctly given by the mean - field theory , ( e.g. the specific heat has a discontinuity ) , the free - energy near the transition also shows an essential singularity , with the singular part varying as @xmath9 $ ] , for temperatures @xmath7 near and greater than the critical temperature @xmath8 . while it is known that higher derivatives of the free energy do show logarithmic singularities in the spherical model for even dimensions @xmath13 @xcite , this seems to be the first case where an essential singularity is encountered in the sub - leading singular part of the free energy in an infinite dimensional model .",
    "the lattice we study is the spider - web lattice , also known as spider - web graph or the spider - web network in literature .",
    "these graphs were introduced by ikeno in 1959 , for efficient design of crossbar exchanges for telephone switching networks @xcite .",
    "the name spider - webs to describe them seems to have been first used by feiner and kappel in 1970 @xcite . with the advent of digital switching and mobile communication networks ,",
    "crossbar exchanges have become obsolete , and their optimal design is no longer of technological interest .",
    "but the spider - web graphs are very interesting structures for statistical physics .",
    "a @xmath14 - node spider network graph consists of @xmath15-levels each of which has @xmath16 vertices .",
    "each vertex in the @xmath17-th level is connected to two vertices each in the @xmath18th levels .",
    "these are finite graphs where all vertices are equivalent . in the thermodynamic limit when the number of vertices in the graph tends to infinity",
    ", the number of sites within a distance @xmath19 of a given site increases exponentially with @xmath19 , and the effective dimension of these graphs is infinite .",
    "these are thus similar to the bethe lattice , which has been studied a lot in statistical physics . however , for the bethe lattice , realized as the limit of tree graphs , separating the bulk properties from the surface properties requires care as most of its sites are near the surface .",
    "one can realize a bethe lattice without surface effects as the limit of a random graph with uniform coordination number , but this involves averaging over disorder , which may be quenched @xcite , or annealed @xcite .",
    "spider - web graphs avoid the difficulties associated with such averagings .",
    "they also have additional symmetries , in addition to translational invariance , which makes the study of statistical physics models on these graphs analytically more tractable",
    ".    given its origins , it is not surprising that most of the earlier studies dealt with the percolation properties of these networks @xcite .",
    "takagi @xcite showed that in a certain class of graphs , the spider - web network has the highest linking probability .",
    "but , chung and hwang @xcite showed that , outside this class , there are other graphs that are better . for subsequent work on the percolation properties on these networks ,",
    "see @xcite . other models on these graphs",
    "have not been studied much so far .",
    "there is large amount work dealing with spectra of different graphs .",
    "some basic references may be found in @xcite .    in this paper , we study the spherical model on the spider - web graph .",
    "we start by determining the normal modes of vibration of masses coupled by nearest -neighbor harmonic springs on this network .",
    "we obtain the entire spectrum for finite values of @xmath15 and @xmath20 , and also describe the qualitative features of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath21 , with @xmath20 finite . in the double limit of both @xmath22 ,",
    "almost all the eigenmodes of the springs problem are localized on this network .",
    "we study the return to origin for the related problem of a random walker on this network .",
    "we show that the probability that a random walker returns to origin after @xmath4 steps varies as @xmath23 .",
    "this should be compared with a power - law decay @xmath24 on @xmath10-dimensional hypercubic lattices , and an exponential decay on the bethe lattice .",
    "we use the knowledge of normal modes of the springs model on this lattice to determine the critical behavior of the spherical model on this graph , and show that the free energy shows an essential singularity at the transition point .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define spider - web graphs , and then define the springs hamiltonian , the random walk problem and the spherical model on these graphs . in section iii , we discuss the decomposition of the hilbert space of the displacement field in the springs problem into subspaces , called sectors , using the symmetries of the spider - web graphs . in section iv , we determine the frequencies of all the normal modes of the springs hamiltonian , and also determine the eigenmodes . in section",
    "v , we use this spectrum to determine the exact generating function for returns to origin of a walker doing a random walk on the vertices of the spider web graph . in section",
    "vi , we show that the singular nature of density of states of the springs model for small frequencies implies that free energy of the spherical model shows a discontinuity in specific heat , as expected from the standard mean - field theory , but also an essential singularity .",
    "a spider - web network is a graph consisting of @xmath25 vertices , divided into @xmath15 levels , each level with @xmath26 vertices , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being positive integers .",
    "we label the levels by integers @xmath29 to @xmath15 , and vertices within a level are labeled by @xmath20-digit integers @xmath30 , base @xmath28 , with @xmath31 . in the following",
    "we discuss only the case @xmath32 .",
    "generalization to other values of @xmath28 is straight - forward .    on a binary string of length @xmath20",
    ", we define an operation @xmath33 of adding a zero from the right , making space for it by shifting all bits by one space to the left .",
    "the left - most ( first ) bit of the original string is lost .",
    "so , for example , for @xmath34 , action of @xmath33 on the binary string @xmath35 yields a string @xmath36 , and we write @xmath37 . the operator @xmath38 adds a @xmath29 to the right .",
    "we similarly define operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which correspond to adding @xmath41 and @xmath29 respectively at the left end , and shifting the bits one space to the right . in this case , the rightmost bit is lost .",
    "clearly , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "also , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "now consider a vertex labeled by a binary integer @xmath30 in the level @xmath17 .",
    "we denote this vertex by @xmath46 .",
    "the spider - web graph is defined by connecting this vertex to the two vertices @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the level @xmath49 .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions , and the vertices in the level @xmath50 are connected to level @xmath51 .",
    "it is convenient to assume that the index @xmath17 is defined only modulo @xmath15 , so that @xmath51 is the same as @xmath52 .",
    "we will take these connecting edges to be undirected .",
    "then , each vertex @xmath46 is also connected to the vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath55 , as otherwise the graph is not fully connected .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows a graph with @xmath56 .",
    "given this structure of connections , it is easy to see that there is unique directed path of length @xmath20 from any vertex @xmath46 to any of the @xmath16 vertices in the level @xmath57 .",
    "if the binary label of the target vertex is @xmath58 , one just starts at the vertex @xmath59 , and takes steps to the next level using edges corresponding to @xmath60 respectively .    in the context of crossbar exchanges ,",
    "we think of each node of the graph as @xmath61 crossbar , with two input lines , and two output lines .",
    "it is natural to work with open boundary conditions , with no direct connections between level @xmath15 and level @xmath29 .",
    "then there are @xmath62 input lines coming into level @xmath29 , and there is an equal number of lines coming out of level @xmath15 .",
    "the total numer of crosspoints used is @xmath12 per vertex of graph . then , using only @xmath63 levels , we can connect any of @xmath62 input lines into the level @xmath51 , we can connect to any of the @xmath62 lines of the crossbars in the level @xmath64 . also , there is a simple algorithm to determine the path from the input node to the output node .",
    "this is much less than the number @xmath65 , which would have been required , if a single stage crossbar was used . if @xmath66 , we get multiple possible paths from the input to output",
    "this was the original reason for interest in these networks .    for studies in statistical physics ,",
    "one is usually interested in the thermodynamical limit , where the effect of boundaries can be ignored .",
    "we note that here , local properties of the network do not depend on @xmath15 or @xmath20 , for distances up to @xmath20 .",
    "for example , the number of sites that are within a distance @xmath30 of any site is the same for all sites , and is independent of @xmath15 and @xmath20 , so long as @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for systems with interactions of finite range , say for a nearest - neighbor ising model defined on this graph , the thermodynamical limit will be well - defined .",
    "as another example , if there is a random walker that moves on the vertices of this graph , taking a step at random along one of the four edges at the current position , the probability of return to starting point after @xmath7 steps is well defined , and independent of @xmath15 and @xmath20 , so long as @xmath68 .",
    "we consider a unit mass attached to each vertex of the spider - web network , coupled to its four neighbors by harmonic springs of unit spring constant .",
    "we denote a scalar variable @xmath69 for each vertex @xmath70 of the graph .",
    "let the corresponding momentum variable be denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "then , the classical -mechanical springs hamiltonian is given by    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the matrix of coupling constants defined by @xmath74    clearly , the matrix @xmath75 can be expressed in terms of the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "as is well - known , the problem of determining the eigenmodes of the set of coupled oscillators reduces to diagonalizing the interaction matrix @xmath75 , equivalently finding the spectrum of the discrete laplacian of the graph .",
    "let @xmath76 be a normal mode of this system with frequency @xmath77 .",
    "then , @xmath78 is a solution of the eigenvalue equation    @xmath79     spider network with periodic boundary conditions , the vertices in the column @xmath80 are identified with those of @xmath51 .",
    "a vertex with @xmath81-bit label @xmath82 in the level @xmath17 is connected to the vertices with labels @xmath83 , and @xmath84 in the level @xmath49 .",
    ", width=384 ]    we will denote by @xmath85 , the fractional number of modes of an eigenvalue less than or equal to @xmath86 .",
    "hence , @xmath87 .",
    "this is called the cumulative spectral density . the spectral density @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 . in the limit @xmath90 , with @xmath20 finite",
    ", we will show that @xmath88 has both a discrete part , and a continuous part .",
    "the fraction of modes that give the continuous part is @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath92 , we get only a discrete spectrum .",
    "it is well - known that the diagonalization of the springs hamiltonian is also related to problem of random walks . consider a continuous - time random walk on the vertices of this graph , where the walker can jump to any one of the neighboring vertices with rate @xmath29",
    "thus , in a short time @xmath93 , it can jump to any of the four neighbors with probability @xmath93 , and stay at the same vertex with probability @xmath94 .",
    "suppose the walker starts at vertex @xmath95 .",
    "then , we denote the probability that the walker is at vertex @xmath96 at time @xmath4 , by @xmath97 .",
    "we define a vector @xmath98 , whose @xmath96-th component is @xmath97 .",
    "then the evolution of @xmath98 satisfies the markov equation    @xmath99    then , the probability of being at vertex @xmath100 at time @xmath4 is given by    @xmath101    the probability of being at the starting point at time @xmath4 is given by @xmath102 . from the translational symmetry of the graph , this does not depend on @xmath95 .",
    "we define the laplace -transform of return probabilities @xmath103 by @xmath104    then it easy to see that @xmath105^{-1 } = \\int_0^{\\infty } d\\omega^2 d(\\omega^2 ) [ s + \\omega^2]^{-1 } \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ]    we use this determination of the normal modes to solve the spherical model on this graph . in the spherical model ,",
    "we assign a scalar variable @xmath106 to each vertex @xmath96 of the graph .",
    "these variables are subjected to a single constraint , known as the spherical constraint    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the total number of sites in the graph .",
    "the spherical model can be obtained as the large @xmath109 limit of an @xmath109-vector model on the same graph @xcite , where we assign an @xmath109-vector spin @xmath110 to each site @xmath96 , with a constraint @xmath111 , at each vertex @xmath96 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spherical model is given by    @xmath112",
    "as noted before , the problem of determination of the normal modes of the springs hamiltonian @xmath113 reduces to that of diagonalizing the matrix @xmath75 .",
    "this is an @xmath114 matrix , where @xmath108 is the number of vertices in the graph , @xmath115 .",
    "the matrix @xmath75 may be viewed as the discrete laplacian operator , acting on the vector space of square - integrable real functions defined on the vertices of the graph . using the symmetries of the problem , we can block - diagonalize the matrix @xmath75 .",
    "we will call the subspaces corresponding to different blocks as sectors .",
    "the spider - web network has a high degree of symmetry .",
    "firstly , all vertices are equivalent .",
    "we define a translation operator @xmath116 which takes a vertex @xmath46 to @xmath117 . clearly , @xmath116 is a symmetry of the graph , and we have @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the identity operator .",
    "there are additional symmetries .",

    "these can be written as @xmath114 matrices .    if we first apply @xmath144 , and then @xmath145 on any vertex @xmath96 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 take values @xmath41 or @xmath29 , the result is independent of @xmath146 .",

    "for @xmath161 , the number of sectors can be substantially greater than the @xmath162 , which is the total dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "it follows that for @xmath161 , a large number of sectors must be null .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath158 is an eigenfunction of @xmath134 with eigenvalue @xmath163 , then @xmath158 must be zero , whenever @xmath164 $ ] .",

    "in particular , this implies that any sector with @xmath167 , and distance between @xmath120 and @xmath128 greater than @xmath168 must be null .    only in the sector with all @xmath169 , the sector decomposition does not break translational invariance , ( the sector with all @xmath170 is zero - dimensional for @xmath66 ) . in this case",
    ", we can break the sector further into @xmath15 one - dimensional subsectors using the eigenvalues of @xmath116 .",
    "it is straight forward to work out the sector decomposition and the spectrum , for small values of @xmath20 explicitly .      for @xmath171",
    ", the graph is shown in fig .",
    "there is one sector with all @xmath172 .",
    "this must have @xmath173 .",
    "thus there are @xmath15 linearly independent variables in this sector , and dimensionality of this sector is @xmath15 .",

    "the corresponding eigenfunction is fully localized within one level , and is shown in fig .",

    "hence this is the dimension of each such sector .",
    "there are @xmath219 @xmath182 s between the outermost two negative @xmath182 s in this band , which can be @xmath156 , and so the number of sectors with a given position of leftmost and rightmost negative @xmath182 s is @xmath220 .",
    "also the left most negative @xmath182 has @xmath15 possible positions .",
