    "the `` dressed - atom picture '' provides a transparent approach to the dynamics of atoms and molecules in strong electromagnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the `` dressing '' provided by the field may equip the atom or molecule with properties quite different from those of a `` bare '' one .",
    "a hallmark example along these lines is given by the modification of zeeman hyperfine spectra of atoms interacting with strong radiofrequency fields : as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ s_3 ] below , in the presence of the dressing field the bare atomic @xmath0-factors become multiplied by a certain bessel function , the argument of which is proportional to the strength of the field , and inversely proportional to its frequency .",
    "thus , experimentally recorded hyperfine spectra depend sensitively on these parameters  @xcite .",
    "closely related phenomena have been observed , for instance , in radiatively assisted collisions of rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a bessel function in response to time - periodic forcing is typical for quantum systems that can be viewed as a set of interacting nearest neighbours , such as the angular momentum substates in the case of the @xmath0-factor modification .",
    "another striking example has emerged only recently : in experiments with ultracold atoms in time - periodically shifted optical lattices , the hopping matrix elements which quantify the magnitude of the tunnelling contact between states located at adjacent lattice sites differ from those of a bare lattice system again by a bessel function , and thus can be tuned by adjusting the amplitude or the frequency of the lattice modulation  @xcite .",
    "this finding now suggests an interesting question : the @xmath0-factor experiment  @xcite with single atoms has been instrumental for establishing the dressed - atom picture ; could the recent experiments  @xcite with bose  einstein condensates lead to a similar picture of `` dressed matter waves '' ?",
    "in other words , can one exploit time - periodic forcing for endowing a macroscopic matter wave with properties it does not have when the forcing is absent ?    in order to expand on this question , we proceed as follows : we first recall in sec .",
    "[ s_2 ] the physics underlying the bessel - function modification occurring in the dressed - atom picture , using the example of a two - level system interacting with a quantised radiation mode .",
    "however , when dealing with cold atoms in time - periodically shifted optical lattices , it is certainly reasonable to describe the time - periodic lattice modulation in terms of an external classical force .",
    "hence , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ s_3 ] how the bessel function appears in that context , employing the floquet formalism",
    ". for fully exploiting the possibilities of control opened up by time - periodic forcing , adiabatic response to slowly changing parameters plays an important role .",
    "therefore , we briefly point out in sec .",
    "[ s_4 ] how the adiabatic principle works for floquet states . in sec .",
    "[ s_5 ] we put all these pieces together and argue that a system of interacting ultracold bosonic atoms in a time - periodically modulated optical lattice can change its state from superfluid to mott - insulator - like and back , if the modulation is switched on and off in an adiabatic manner , _ and _ the parameters are chosen judiciously  @xcite .",
    "this scenario , still to be confirmed experimentally , could lend significant support to the notion of dressed matter waves : the dressing achieved through the lattice modulation determines the state of the system .",
    "we finally sum up our conclusions in sec .",
    "we start by studying a `` two - level atom '' interacting with both a static external field and a single mode of a quantised radiation field .",
    "its dynamics are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 specifies the unperturbed system with energy eigenvalues @xmath3 , @xmath4 models a radiation mode with frequency @xmath5 in terms of a harmonic oscillator with dimensionless oscillator coordinate  @xmath6 , and @xmath7 describes the static field of strength @xmath8 and the coupling to the radiation mode , with a strength specified by a constant @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath10 , so that the two `` atomic '' levels are degenerate , this hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) obviously is diagonalised by the shifted harmonic - oscillator states @xmath11 with energies @xmath12 the functions @xmath13 denote the familiar eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "@xmath14 the static field splits the two atomic levels by the amount @xmath15 .",
    "when this splitting is matched by an integer number of photons , that is , when @xmath16 the unperturbed states are pairwise degenerate , @xmath17 .",
    "we now study the removal of this degeneracy between an `` @xmath18-photon state '' and an `` @xmath19-photon state '' for nonzero @xmath20 , assuming @xmath21 .",
    "degenerate - state perturbation theory requires to evaluate the matrix elements of the `` perturbation '' @xmath22 in the basis  ( [ eq : ups ] ) , and , hence , to compute the overlap integrals @xmath23 with the help of the expansion @xmath24 this integral can be calculated exactly , yielding @xmath25 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 assuming @xmath27 , and employing the generalised laguerre polynomials  @xcite @xmath28 this expression  ( [ eq : exp ] ) takes the form @xmath29 now we are interested in the limiting case of almost classical fields containing a very large number of photons . in order to maintain the resonance condition  ( [ eq : res ] )",
    ", we keep the integer @xmath30 fixed while letting @xmath18 and @xmath19 tend to infinity . in that limit , one has  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes a bessel function of integer order  @xmath33 .",
    "hence , one finally obtains @xmath34 in that same limit .",
    "it remains to interpret the peculiar - looking argument of the bessel function .",
    "when placing the field oscillator into a coherent state , its amplitude @xmath35 is determined by energy considerations : since , as expressed by the resonance condition  ( [ eq : res ] ) , the field is exchanging @xmath36 photons with the atom , the average field energy is the arithmetic mean of the energy of an @xmath18-photon state and that of an @xmath19-photon state .",
    "this gives @xmath37 which , in view of the definition  ( [ eq : alp ] ) , implies @xmath38    the energy eigenvalues which have been degenerate for @xmath10 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 , now are shifted by @xmath40 for nonzero  @xmath20 . for energies sufficiently high to validate the preceding reasoning ,",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) thus consists of a sequence of doublets split by @xmath41 , the doublet centers being separated by @xmath42 .",
    "putting all things together , this means that the `` atom '' @xmath22 , when `` dressed '' by the interaction @xmath43 under the conditions detailed above , behaves like a _ noninteracting _ system  ( [ eq : atm ] ) with a modified level splitting determined by the effective @xmath20-parameter @xmath44 this is the lesson to be learned from the present two - level example : when the driving field can be considered classical , resonant forcing effectuates a modification of the `` atomic '' level splitting such that the unperturbed splitting is multiplied by a bessel function with an argument proportional to the driving amplitude divided by @xmath42 .",
    "the order @xmath33 of this bessel function is determined by the number of photons in resonance with the transition , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) .",
    "in particular , when there is no static field , one has @xmath45 and thus recovers the modification of the splitting by a @xmath46 bessel function which also underlies , for instance , the coherent destruction of tunnelling of a single particle in driven symmetric double well potential  @xcite . quite recently , this phenomenon has been observed with cold atoms in periodic double - well potentials  @xcite .",
    "in order to avoid the consideration of a quantised field and to start with a classical driving force right away , we now treat the explicitly time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath47 where the time - independent system @xmath48 corresponds to a spin  1 in a magnetic field  @xmath49 oriented in the @xmath50-direction , @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the bohr magneton , and @xmath53 the land @xmath0-factor .",
    "the external forcing is given as an additional static magnetic field @xmath54 and an oscillating field with amplitude @xmath55 and frequency  @xmath5 , both directed along the @xmath6-axis , @xmath56      \\left(\\begin{array}{rrr }              1        & 0             & 0             \\\\              0        & \\phantom{-}0 & 0             \\\\          0        & 0             & -1            \\\\      \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : tlf}\\ ] ] apart from the fact that here the forcing is truly classical , this system closely resembles the previous two - level example  ( [ eq : ham ] ) : the unperturbed system is characterised by `` nearest - neighbour coupling '' , while the forcing is diagonal .",
    "now the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htl ] ) depends periodically on time , @xmath57 with period @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the schrdinger equation @xmath59 has floquet - type solutions  @xcite @xmath60 where the functions @xmath61 inherit the periodic nature of @xmath62 , @xmath63 these functions , together with the corresponding quasienergies @xmath64 , are obtained as solutions to the eigenvalue problem @xmath65 which is defined in an _ extended hilbert space _",
    "@xmath66 of @xmath67-periodic functions  @xcite in which the time  @xmath68 is regarded as a _ coordinate _ and which , therefore , is equipped with the scalar product @xmath69 combining the standard scalar product @xmath70 for the system s original hilbert space @xmath71 with time - averaging .",
    "we stick to the convention of writing @xmath61 for a floquet function viewed in @xmath71 , but @xmath72 when that same function is regarded as an element of the extended space @xmath66 .",
    "there is one issue implied by the floquet formalism which requires particular attention .",
    "namely , if @xmath73 solves @xmath74 with quasienergy @xmath75 , then @xmath76 solves @xmath77 with quasienergy @xmath78 where @xmath79 is _ any _ ( positive or negative ) integer .",
    "hence , the quasienergy spectrum repeats itself periodically on the energy - axis ; each `` brillouin zone '' of width @xmath42 contains one respresentative , labelled by  @xmath79 , of the class of eigenvalues belonging to the floquet state labelled by  @xmath18 .",
    "but when following the evolution of a wave function @xmath80 in the physical hilbert space @xmath71 , only _",
    "one _ representative from each class is needed , giving an expansion of the form @xmath81 with time - independent coefficients  @xmath82 .    in order to apply this lore to the spin-1-system  ( [ eq : htl ] )",
    ", we observe that the floquet basis states @xmath83 diagonalise the quasienergy operator @xmath84 which is obtained when there is no field  @xmath49 , so that the eigenstates of the three - level hamiltonian  ( [ eq : tls ] ) are degenerate ; the `` unperturbed '' quasienergies express the zeeman splitting caused by the other static field  @xmath54 : @xmath85 if the oscillating field is resonant in the sense that @xmath86 then the floquet functions @xmath87 correspond to the same quasienergy , and thus are degenerate .",
    "the removal of this degeneracy for nonvanishing  @xmath49 once again is assessed by degenerate - state perturbation theory , assuming @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast to sec .",
    "[ s_2 ] , now the calculation proceeds in the extended hilbert space @xmath66 , and thus invokes the computation of matrix elements @xmath89 with respect to the scalar product  ( [ eq : skp ] ) . but",
    "this is what makes the mathematics quite simple : using the identity @xmath90 for expanding the unperturbed floquet functions , time averaging according to the definition  ( [ eq : skp ] ) serves to filter out one particular term from the sum , determined by the resonance condition  ( [ eq : reb ] ) .",
    "thus , one immediately obtains @xmath91 giving the quasienergies @xmath92 hence , the effect of the forcing  ( [ eq : tlf ] ) on the system  ( [ eq : tls ] ) is described by replacing the bare @xmath0-factor @xmath53 by the effective substitute @xmath93 evidently , the line of reasoning adopted in this section to treat classical forcing parallels the arguments given in sec .",
    "[ s_2 ] for a system interacting with a quantised field .",
    "but here the argument is considerably more direct , avoiding the analysis referring to `` large photon numbers '' .",
    "the price to pay for this simplification is a quasienergy spectrum which is strictly @xmath42-periodic und thus unbounded from below , whereas the exact quantum mechanical energy spectrum becomes approximately @xmath42-periodic only for sufficiently high quantum numbers .",
    "nonetheless , for systems subjected to time - periodic classical forcing the floquet picture combines great conceptual clarity with a fairly succinct computational approach .",
    "one additional piece of input is required before we can treat ultracold atoms in a periodically shifted optical lattice , namely , the adiabatic response of floquet states to slowly changing parameters . in order to make the point ,",
    "let us briefly recapitulate the standard adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics  @xcite : the task is solve a time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath94 with a hamiltonian @xmath95 depending on a parameter @xmath96 which changes slowly in time .",
    "the strategy then is to `` freeze '' that parameter in a first step , and to consider the family of eigenvalue problems @xmath97 for each relevant , fixed value of  @xmath98 .",
    "let us stipulate that the phases of the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath99 be chosen such that @xmath100 if then the system initially , at time @xmath101 , is prepared in a particular eigenstate , @xmath102 and @xmath98 is allowed to vary sufficiently slowly , an approximate solution to the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) is given by @xmath103 provided the parameter variation proceeds smoothly , and @xmath99 is separated for all  @xmath98 by an energy gap from the other states .",
    "hence , the system stays in the state continuously connected to the one it was originally prepared in , and acquires a `` dynamical '' phase determined by an integral over the instantaneous energy eigenvalues encountered during its evolution .",
    "we remark that it might not be possible to satisfy the phase - fixing condition  ( [ eq : pfc ] ) globally if there is more than one time - dependent parameter ; this fact then forces one to explicitly introduce berry s geometrical phase  @xcite .    when trying to transfer this adiabatic theorem to systems with a hamiltonian @xmath104 which would depend periodically on time if the parameter  @xmath98 where fixed , @xmath105 , but which actually exhibits an additional `` slow '' time - dependence of @xmath98 , one faces a problem : if one simply `` stopped the time '' in order to define an instantaneous hamiltonian",
    ", one would not only freeze the parameter  @xmath98 , but also loose the periodic time - dependence .",
    "however , it appears much more natural to freeze _ only _ @xmath98 , and to maintain the periodic time - dependence on the level of the instantaneous eigenvalue problems .",
    "the way to do so , as formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite , includes a detour to the extended hilbert space @xmath66 introduced in the previous section : instead of starting from the actual schrdinger equation @xmath106 one first distinguishes two different time variables , a variable @xmath107 for the slow , parametric time dependence and a variable @xmath68 for the fast , oscillating one , and then considers the evolution equation @xmath108 in @xmath66 .",
    "if this equation can be solved , one returns to the desired wave function @xmath80 evolving in the system s true hilbert space @xmath71 by equating @xmath107 and @xmath68 : one has @xmath109 since @xmath110 on the level of the extended evolution equation  ( [ eq : eee ] ) , one can now freeze  @xmath98 by stopping solely the time @xmath107 , while leaving the other time  @xmath68 unaffected .",
    "this then defines the instantaneous eigenvalue problems in terms of the operators appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eee ] ) , @xmath111 since , by construction , this problem lives in @xmath66 , it is exactly the quasienergy problem formulated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qee ] ) .",
    "the remaining reasoning follows the standard route : we fix the phases of the instantaneous eigenstates by requiring @xmath112 and start at time @xmath113 with the initial condition @xmath114 then @xmath115 is an adiabatic solution to the extended evolution equation  ( [ eq : eee ] ) , provided the propositions of the adiabatic theorem can be met , and returning to @xmath71 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pro ] ) gives @xmath116 as an approximate solution to the original schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : hpt ] ) .",
    "in short , for adiabatic quantum transport in periodically time - dependent systems with slowly changing parameters the floquet states adopt a role which is completely analogous to that played by energy eigenstates in conventional situations described by an equation of the type  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) .",
    "the strategy of `` lifting '' the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) to the extended space @xmath66 , applying standard techniques there , and then projecting back to @xmath71 is useful not only for understanding the structure of the problem , but also for detailed computations of non - adiabatic corrections  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a big caveat .",
    "as remarked above , the standard adiabatic theorem demands that the adiabatically transported state be separated by an energy gap from all other states .",
    "accordingly , when transferring this theorem to @xmath66 , one requires that the adiabatically transported floquet state be separated in _ quasienergy _ from the other ones .",
    "but since one quasienergy - representative from each state falls into each quasienergy brillouin zone , this condition is almost impossible to satisfy when there is a large number of states .",
    "one then expects a multitude of near - degeneracies `` modulo @xmath42 '' , reflecting a dense set of multiphoton resonances .",
    "in such a situation , it appears unlikely that an adiabatic limit exists  @xcite .",
    "however , it appears equally plausibe that , if one does _ not _ consider the fictitious limit of a parameter variation proceeding `` infinitely slowly '' , but instead specifies that the variation takes place within a finite time interval , most of these resonances are not `` seen '' long enough by the system to become active .",
    "then effectively adiabatic motion is possible , if major resonances can be avoided .",
    "although it might be hard to formulate this somewhat vague notion in a mathematically precise manner in the general case , the emerging adiabatic principle ( not theorem ) for floquet states can provide intuitively clear guidelines for understanding the evolution of periodically driven systems in well - designed particular cases .",
    "the following discussion of the driven bose  hubbard model exemplifies that the occurrence of effectively adiabatic motion , or its destruction by active resonances , depends on the choice of the frequency .",
    "the bose  hubbard model , as devised by fisher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , describes bose particles on a lattice .",
    "there exists a tunnelling contact between neigbouring sites , with a strength specified by a hopping matrix element  @xmath20 ; each pair of particles occupying the same site increases the energy of the system by an amount  @xmath117 due to repulsion .",
    "thus , for the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice with @xmath118 sites the many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a bose particle at the @xmath19th lattice site , obeying @xmath122 = \\delta_{\\ell , k}$ ] , and @xmath123 gives the number of particles on that site . assuming that there are @xmath124 particles in total , and that the filling factor @xmath125 is integer , the system s ground state undergoes a significant change when the dimensionless control parameter @xmath126 is varied : in the interaction - free limit @xmath127 it corresponds to a superfluid , given by a bose ",
    "einstein condensate with all particles occupying the lowest bloch state , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the vacuum state . in the opposite limit of vanishing tunnelling contact , @xmath130 ,",
    "the individual sites are isolated , so that the systems adopts the mott - insulating ground state @xmath131 when the lattice is infinitely large , that is , for @xmath132 and @xmath133 while keeping @xmath125 constant at an integer value , a sharp transition between the superfluid and the mott - insulating regime occurs at a critical value @xmath134 , accompanied by the emergence of a finite energy gap . for a 1d lattice with filling factor @xmath135 , one finds @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "the bose  hubbard model has received considerable attention recently , since it can be realised with ultracold atoms in @xmath137-dimensional optical lattices ( @xmath138 )  @xcite , allowing one to investigate the superfluid - to - mott insulator quantum phase transition in great detail in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "we view ultracold bose particles in an optical lattice as prime candidates for exploring the concept of dressed matter waves .",
    "namely , atoms in a 1d lattice can be subjected to a time - periodic lattice modulation , to the effect that a term of the form @xmath139",
    "\\sum_{\\ell = 1}^m \\ell \\hat{n}_{\\ell } \\label{eq : hdr}\\ ] ] is added to the system  ( [ eq : bhh ] ) . here",
    "@xmath140 denotes the amplitude of a drive with angular frequency  @xmath5 , typically on the order of one to a few kilohertz  @xcite , while @xmath8 corresponds to a static lattice tilt  @xcite ; the extension to lattices with higher dimension is straightforward .",
    "if there were no interaction between the particles , that is , for @xmath141 , the total hamiltonian @xmath142 would be identical in form to the systems studied in secs .",
    "[ s_2 ] and [ s_3 ] : one faces nearest - neighbour coupling combined with homogeneous site - diagonal forcing .",
    "hence , when the resonance condition @xmath143 corresponding to the previous equations  ( [ eq : res ] ) and ( [ eq : reb ] ) is satisfied , so that the energy of @xmath33 `` photons '' matches the energy shift induced by the static tilt between adjacent sites , one can adapt the results  ( [ eq : jzs ] ) and ( [ eq : jzb ] ) : under such conditions , the driven system behaves approximately like an undriven one with the modified hopping matrix element @xmath144 more careful analysis  @xcite shows that this expression remains valid even for nonzero  @xmath117 at least in the high - frequency regime where @xmath145 and @xmath146 , thus including the strong - coupling case @xmath147 .",
    "the experimental data available so far give clear evidence of this modification  ( [ eq : mod ] ) both for @xmath45 , when there is no static tilt  @xcite , and for @xmath148 , when one has `` photon''-assisted tunnelling  @xcite .",
    "this finding now directly leads to a further consequence : the ratio @xmath126 governs the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition in the bare bose  hubbard model ; this control parameter has to be replaced by @xmath149 in the presence of resonant forcing . since @xmath150 depends significantly on the amplitude  @xmath140 , it should be possible to cross the border between the superfluid and the insulator regime by varying that amplitude  @xcite",
    ". however , the notion of a `` superfluid '' or a `` mott insulator '' refers to the ground state of the bose  hubbard model , so that it becomes necessary to guide the ground state of the undriven system @xmath151 into the effective ground state of the driven system @xmath152 . that `` effective ground state '' , of course , is the floquet state which originates from the ground state of @xmath151 when the drive is turned on , so that the adiabatic principle discussed in sec",
    ".  [ s_4 ] comes into play : in an experiment aiming at a demonstration of a superfluid - to - mott insulator transition induced by time - periodic forcing , the driving amplitude should be turned on smoothly , such that the system s wave function can follow the floquet state connected to the unperturbed ground state .",
    "but since adiabatic following in a periodically forced many - level system with a `` dense '' quasienergy spectrum is endangered by a host of multiphoton - like resonances , the precise choice of the protocol is not trivial : the frequency has to be chosen such that major resonances are avoided , while the amplitude has to vary sufficiently slowly in order to allow for a reasonable degree of adiabaticity , but still sufficiently fast in order to pass minor resonances before they become active .",
    "we illustrate these deliberations by numerical calculations for small systems with @xmath153 particles on @xmath154 lattice sites .",
    "the initial @xmath124-body wave function @xmath155 at time @xmath101 is chosen as the ground state of the bose  hubbard model  ( [ eq : bhh ] ) with @xmath156 , falling into the superfluid regime when the system is sufficiently large . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath157 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to @xmath45 ; related studies for @xmath148 are documented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "after selecting some frequency @xmath5 , and thus specifying the time scale @xmath58 , the time - dependent force is turned on with an amplitude @xmath158 which rises linearly between @xmath101 and @xmath159 from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "the latter value lies close to the first zero of @xmath162 , and thus gives a quite large ratio @xmath149 , which should place the system far into the mott - like regime .",
    "then the amplitude is kept constant at @xmath163 between @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and finally ramped linearly back to zero between @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",

    "this momentum distribution is sharply peaked , due to ( quasi ) long - range phase coherence , in the superfluid phase , but apparently structureless in the mott regime .",
    "figure  [ f_1 ] shows the results for @xmath170 : initially one finds a strongly peaked distribution , as expected for a superfluid - like state , which then becomes practically flat at @xmath171 .",
    "however , after the driving amplitude @xmath158 has been switched off again at @xmath172 , the sharp pattern reappears : this fact clearly signals that the flat distribution between @xmath164 and @xmath166 is not due to loss of coherence resulting from uncontrolled excitations , but rather indicates the mott - like regime , since otherwise it would not be possible to switch back ( almost ) adiabatically to the initial state .",
    "thus , this figure provides a glimpse at a quantum phase transition induced by `` dressing '' a matter wave , although , of course , a truly sharp `` transition '' can not be achieved with @xmath173 .",
    "but the small system already is sufficently rich to demonstrate that an ideal outcome can not be taken for granted : fig .",

    "[ f_1 ] ; essentially ; only one single instantaneous floquet state is populated during the entire process .",
    "in contrast , in the second case the quasienergy level originating from the ground state undergoes several large avoided crossings .",
    "incomplete landau  zener transitions at these avoided quasienergy crossings then lead to a significant population of the anticrossing floquet states  @xcite , rendering an adiabatic return to the initial state impossible .",
    "ultracold atoms in time - periodically modulated optical lattices give rise to `` dressed matter waves '' , in analogy to the dressed atoms known from atomic physics  @xcite . such dressed systems acquire properties quite different from their `` bare '' antecedents , the modification of atomic land @xmath0-factors setting a prominent example  @xcite .",
    "an effect closely related to this @xmath0-factor modification is a transition of ultracold bosonic atoms in a modulated optical lattice from a superfluid to a mott - insulator - like state in response to a variation of the modulation strength ; this transition is mediated by a modification of the nearest - neighbour hopping matrix elements relying on precisely the same mechanism as that of the @xmath0-factors .",
    "an experimental verification of this proposal involves adiabatic following of the many - body floquet state originating from the ground state of the bare system ; such adiabatic following is a quite tricky concept in the context of driven matter waves .",
    "the question to what extent multiphoton - like resonances can be avoided ( or perhaps deliberately be induced and exploited ) is open to experimental investigation .",
    "the long - term perspective of these considerations , however , seems to lie elsewhere . just as the @xmath0-factor modification is but _ one _ facet of the dressed - atom picture , there are further possibilites of controlling the state of a matter wave in an optical lattice by time - periodic forcing .",
    "our present scheme defines a first cornerstone ; if achieved , more demanding ones can follow .",
