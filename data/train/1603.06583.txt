    "compact groups of galaxies are the densest known systems typically containing three to ten galaxies within only a few tens of kiloparsecs . since the discovery of stephan s quintet @xcite , numerous studies have identified small aggregations of galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite first identified well - defined samples of compact groups in the local universe . since",
    "then many investigators have constructed compact group catalogs based on much more extensive galaxy surveys @xcite .    because the separation of galaxies within compact groups is comparable with their sizes , these dense systems have been laboratories for the study of the impact of galaxy - galaxy interactions using spatially resolved spectroscopy @xcite and multi - wavelength observations ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these groups are also associated with extended x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the low hi content of compact groups is probably a consequence of continuous tidal stripping or heating by gravitational interactions among member galaxies @xcite .",
    "low redshift compact groups are intriguing targets for integral field unit ( ifu ) observations that examine internal kinematics along with , for example , spatially resolved strong - line star formation and metallicity diagnostics that probe the timescale of the gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "the high frequency of obvious tidal interactions among compact group members suggests that their lifetime must be short @xcite . in principle",
    ", the galaxies should merge within a few gyr timescale .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the group crossing time .",
    "nonetheless , compact groups are abundant in the nearby universe with space densities ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the mere existence of compact groups at the current epoch remains a puzzle .",
    "some previous studies propose that compact groups may persist for a much longer than the apparent interactions would suggest @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the groups are replenished from the surrounding environment as galaxies merge .",
    "however , evaluation of the environments of compact groups in existing catalogs paints a confusing picture . in some catalogs 50 - 76%",
    "are in surroundings @xcite dense enough for replenishment ; in the 2mass compact group catalog only 27% @xcite are in dense surroundings making the replenishment model untenable .",
    "existing catalogs of compact groups contain some observational biases which may limit their usefulness for understanding the existence and evolution of these systems .",
    "the selection may introduce an artificial dependence of apparent group properties on redshift and may bias the environments of the selected systems .",
    "@xcite first derive a catalog of compact groups from a complete redshift survey .",
    "they use a straightforward friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm to select group members separated by a fixed projected separation and rest frame velocity difference . as a result of the selection ,",
    "their catalog includes both nearby groups and groups in dense surroundings .",
    "they emphasize that previous criteria designed to select isolated systems actually introduce a bias against the inclusion of the nearest compact group candidates .    here",
    "we extend the approach of @xcite to the sample of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 12 ( dr12 ) at @xmath7 ( corresponding to the main galaxy sample of sdss dr7 ) . to capture nearby systems we enhance the sdss redshift survey by including galaxies with @xmath2 .",
    "we use a similar fof algorithm to select a sample of 1588 compact group candidates from the magnitude - limited catalog .",
    "this sample of compact group candidates is large enough to enable the construction of volume - limited subsamples .",
    "these samples are important for understanding observational biases including the sdss fiber - positioning constraint .",
    "these samples are also important for exploring the properties of the groups that are selected to be similar throughout the sample redshift range .",
    "section 2 describes the data we use including the galaxy sample with @xmath2 .",
    "we explain the fof algorithm in  3 .",
    "we also discuss the additional criteria applied by previous studies and lay out the ways that these criteria may affect the resulting catalog .",
    "we describe the resulting magnitude- and volume - limited catalogs and compare our catalogs with a previous large catalog @xcite and explore the salient differences . in  4 , we compare the properties of compact group candidates in the catalogs we derive with the properties of groups in previous samples .",
    "one important difference is that groups in previous catalogs have sizes that tend to increase with redshift which is not seen in this study . in  5 we discuss the selection issues which may lead to this behavior .",
    "these selection issues also tend to eliminate nearby dense systems that are prime candidates for detailed multi - wavelength studies . in ",
    "6 we use the volume - limited catalogs to highlight the impact of the sdss fiber - positioning constraints on the selection of compact group candidates from the redshift survey .",
    "we include an appendix that discusses systems removed by the additional selection on luminosity contrast and surface brightness .",

    ", width=321 ]    we derive a sample of compact groups from the spectroscopic sample of sdss dr12 @xcite galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "the dr12 includes redshifts for more than 2.4 million galaxies .",
    "the sdss galaxy sample is incomplete for galaxies with @xmath2 because of the saturation @xcite .",
    "fiber placement constraints also limit the completeness of catalogs of compact groups derived from the sdss .    to reduce the incompleteness of the sdss , we supplement the catalog with redshifts from the literature ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also add redshifts from recent fast observations at fred lawrence whipple observatory @xcite .",
    "these additional data ( fast + literature ) include 7796 redshifts for galaxies with @xmath2 and 22507 for galaxies with @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting sample contains 2,782,483 redshifts .",
    "figure [ volume ] shows the @xmath17 corrected , evolution - corrected absolute @xmath18band magnitudes as a function of redshift .",
    "we use the @xmath19correct software ( ver 4.2 ) of @xcite for k - correction , shifted to @xmath20 , and applied the evolution correction given by @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the dashed line indicates the magnitude limit of the sample .",
    "we further restrict the catalog to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "these limits remove the virgo cluster and they avoid use of the low density survey at the high redshift end of the sdss .",
    "this restricted redshift sample includes 654,066 galaxies .",
    "we adopt the morphology for compact group galaxies from the korea institute for advanced study ( kias ) dr7 value - added catalog ( vagc ) @xcite .",
    "the kias dr7 vagc lists the morphology of galaxies based on the @xmath23 color , the @xmath24 color gradient , and on the @xmath25 band concentration index @xcite .",
    "for the small fraction of galaxies not included in the kias dr7 vagc , we visually inspect the galaxies and divide them into early and late types based on the sdss images .",

    "the mass - to - light ratio is calculated by fitting synthetic seds to the observed photometry .",
    "we adopt the photometric parameters of compact group galaxies from the sdss pipeline @xcite .",
    "synthetic seds are generated using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "we vary the star formation history , age , extinction and metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "the star formation histories are exponentially declining ( @xmath26 ) with @xmath27-folding times ( @xmath28 ) ranging between 0.1 and 30 gyr .",
    "the stellar population ages range between 0 and 13 gyr .",
    "the @xcite extinction law is adopted and @xmath29 ranges from @xmath30 .",
    "the models have two metallicities and we use the @xcite initial mass function to calculate stellar mass .",
    "we use the fof algorithm of @xcite to identify compact groups in the spectroscopic sample . for each galaxy ,",
    "the fof finds neighboring galaxies within a fixed projected physical spatial distance ( @xmath31 ) and rest frame line - of - sight velocity linking length ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the linking lengths are redshift independent .",
    "we bundle linked galaxies into a single galaxy system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant compact group candidates we identify have a projected physical size that is essentially redshift independent ( see section [ prop ] ) .    we test various linking lengths for the fof .",
    "we start from a projected linking length of @xmath33 kpc and a radial linking length of @xmath34 following @xcite who identified compact groups from the cfa2 and ssrs redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite used these linking lengths because they approximately matched the median separation between hickson compact group galaxies .",
    "their compact groups thus have physical properties similar to the hickson compact groups @xcite .",
    "the linking lengths of @xmath33 kpc and @xmath34 we choose identify 42 of the 57 hickson compact groups .",
    "the groups we miss would require a larger linking length of @xmath35 kpc . in general , the projected linking length of @xmath36 kpc and the rest frame line - of - sight velocity of @xmath37 @xcite actually identify compact groups with physical sizes and galaxy number densities similar to the hickson compact groups ( see  [ prop ] ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that these linking lengths minimize interlopers with discordant redshifts while recovering systems similar to the original hickson compact groups .",
    "these linking lengths also have the advantage that they are often used to identify close pairs @xcite .",
    "thus , our catalog can be combined with catalogs of close pairs in the literature and future analyses of these compact groups can be compared to previous work on pairs ."
