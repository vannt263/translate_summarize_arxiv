    "of the 28 parameters of the standard model ( including neutrino masses and mixing ) the quark and lepton masses appear particularly puzzling . we would expect that the spectrum of masses would exhibit some underlying structure , much as the periodic table and the hadron spectrum respectively reveal the dynamics of atoms and elementary particles .",
    "however , apparently the quark and lepton masses do not show any such pattern . aside from a rough correlation of mass with generation , decades of searching",
    "have not revealed any significant regularity in the masses .",
    "perhaps there is none .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that the masses and mixings are not uniquely predicted , but are representative of an ensemble of possibilities .",
    "the masses and mixing then reveal the `` weight '' or `` measure '' of the underlying theory .",
    "this possibility was first proposed by donoghue in @xcite , and we develop it further . this is a plausible outcome of the string theory landscape @xcite . in this description , there are very many standard model vacua with parameters close to those observed , and yet many more with different parameters . while we observe only a single ground state , the solution that we observe is representative of the ensemble of possible sm vacua that occur in the landscape",
    ". in particular , the yukawa couplings would not be unique , but would be representative of the couplings found in the ensemble of solutions .",
    "since we have many manifestations of the yukawa couplings ( 9 quark and lepton masses , two neutrino mass differences as well as the ckm and mns weak mixing elements ) we may apply statistical methods even though we live in a single member of the possible landscape vacua .",
    "our primary assumption is that the observed masses are representative of this ensemble . by studying the phenomenology of the masses",
    ", we then learn about the nature of the underlying theory .    by employing statistical tests",
    "we will show that the observed quark masses appear to be distributed in a scale - invariant fashion .",
    "this was already suggested in @xcite but we provide better statistical measures .",
    "this result can be readily seen in fig .",
    "[ scaleinvariant ] .",
    "a scale invariant set of masses is one where the values appear as a uniform random distribution when plotted on a log scale .",
    "the masses of the quarks and charged leptons are shown on such a scale in fig .",
    "[ scaleinvariant ] and appear visually to be consistent with being uniformly random .",
    "in section 3 , we use statistical tests to confirm this and to quantify how far the weight could deviate from a scale invariant form . in section 4",
    "we apply this distribution to the full yukawa matrices of quarks and investigate the weak mixing angles .",
    "we will see that one naturally generates a hierarchy in the ckm elements similar to the one found in nature , aside from a discrete ambiguity concerning the generation structure .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the observed cp violation is readily reproduced .",
    "the neutrino masses appear quite different from other lepton masses , with a possible explanation being the seesaw mechanism and the presence of heavy right handed majorana mass .",
    "we explore the neutrino masses in a similar fashion , using the same weight for the dirac masses and allowing a different weight for the majorana masses .",
    "we describe the neutrino phenomenology in section 5 .",
    "it is possible that these results could be useful in testing or exploring the string landscape .",
    "for example , it has been suggested @xcite that a scale invariant weight could emerge from the intersecting brane worlds construction @xcite of the standard model .",
    "if some branches of the landscape yield weights compatible with observations while others do not , this could be used to refine our location in the space of string theory solutions .",
    "we are clearly far from an understanding of the landscape , but the masses and mixings of the leptons can play a useful role in landscape phenomenology .",
    "the most fundamental assumption of our approach is the existence of a large ensemble of nearly equivalent vacuum states with different values of the quark masses , of which our vacua is assumed to be representative .",
    "the string landscape could be such a theory .",
    "it has been estimated @xcite that there are perhaps @xmath4 standard model vacua with parameters agreeing with observation within the experimental error bars .",
    "there are then many more that look like the standard model but have other values of the quark and lepton masses .",
    "this larger set of sm vacua then constitutes our ensemble .    within this ensemble",
    "we need to make other assumptions .",
    "for example , we are assuming that the quark masses are not correlated with each other .",
    "if there are really of order @xmath4 vacua this seems reasonable .",
    "we could hold any one of the quark masses fixed and still find a whole range of values for the other masses .",
    "we also will make the assumption that quark and charged lepton masses ( but not neutrino masses ) play by the same rules , although we will explore some slight differences that arise due to the differences between quarks and leptons .",
    "finally , we need to make assumptions about the whole matrix of yukawa couplings , as will be discussed below .",
    "the weight @xmath5 is a probability distribution function for the masses ( or later for the yukawa couplings ) .",
    "it is defined by considering the fraction of masses @xmath6 found at a value @xmath7 within @xmath8 as @xmath9 the normalization of the weight is by definition then @xmath10 for the simple weights @xmath11 that we consider , this normalization condition demands upper limits and , in some cases , lower limits for the range of allowed masses .    because the masses depend on the energy scale , the weight will also be depend on this scale .",
    "the renormalization group allows us to determine the scale dependence , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "when the energy scale is changed from @xmath12 to @xmath13 a mass @xmath14 will change to the value @xmath15 , defining a functional relationship @xmath16 or the reverse @xmath17 . in order to preserve the definition of the weight",

    "the renormalization group equations for the combined qcd gauge and yukawa running for @xmath27 are @xmath28 where @xmath29 , using @xmath12 as the initial scale .",
    "note that the qcd interaction tends to make the yukawa coupling larger as one scales down in energy ( @xmath30 positive ) , while the yukawa self interaction tends to make the yukawa coupling smaller .",
    "one of the consequences of this is the well known quasi - fixed - point @xcite at @xmath31  gev - all large yukawa couplings will run to a value close to this fixed point when scaled down from large energy to the @xmath32 scale .",
    "the solution to the yukawa rge has the form @xcite @xmath33^{1/2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b(t ) & = & \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s(t)}{\\alpha_s(0)}\\right)^{4/7 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we neglect the qed effects and only consider the yukawa interaction . in this case , the above formulas continue to hold , but with the identification @xmath35    let us look at a particular weight which plays an important role in the rest of this paper .",
    "this is a weight that has the form @xmath36 , which we will call the _ scale invariant _ weight . to normalize this form we need to limit the range of masses with an upper and a lower cutoff , so that the complete form is @xmath37 this distribution is scale invariant in two senses .",
    "first , a probability distribution that goes as @xmath38 is clearly invariant under a rescaling of all masses @xmath39 .",
    "the endpoints are not invariant but they rescale in the obvious fashion . in addition",
    ", this weight is invariant under renormalization group transformation of the gauge interactions changing from one scale @xmath12 to another scale @xmath40 .",
    "this can be seen simply from eq .",
    "( [ gauge ] ) .    however , the yukawa interactions modify the shape of this weight .",
    "in particular , if the weight takes the above form at a scale @xmath12 , then at a lower scale @xmath40 it will have the form @xmath41 \\frac { 1 } { \\log \\frac { m_+ } { m_{- } } }",
    "\\ \\frac { 1 } { m } \\",
    "\\theta      \\left ( m - \\hat{m}_{- } \\right ) \\theta \\left ( \\hat{m}_+ - m \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath42^{1/2}}\\ ] ] are the rescaled endpoints .",
    "@xmath43    we can illustrate the renormalizaton group effects by considering the transformation from a grand unified scale of @xmath44  gev down to the @xmath32 scale . at the gut scale we postulate for the yukawa couplings the weight @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the values of the endpoints have been chosen to allow the mass ranges to extend from below the electron mass to above the top quark mass . when transformed down to the @xmath32 scale ,",
    "the maximum value of the quark mass distribution is @xmath48  gev and the minimum value is @xmath49  mev . for the leptons , the corresponding values are @xmath50  gev and @xmath51  mev .",
    "note that the rescaled ranges of the distributions are different for quarks and leptons . at low values of the mass the weight retains the @xmath52 form , but the larger values the shape of the distribution",
    "is modified .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ run ] ( a ) for the quarks and fig .",
    "[ run ] ( b ) for the leptons .",
    "the modification to the shape is gentle enough that we will ignore it in most of the phenomenological applications below .",
    "however , in the next section we will briefly explore the effect of rescaling the quark and lepton masses to the gut scale and fitting the weight at that scale .",
    "in this section we will treat the quark and charged lepton masses and will determine the weight that best describes their distribution . we describe the masses at the scale of @xmath53 . running the quark masses to @xmath53",
    "the dominant contributions come from qcd running and we can neglect electroweak running for our purposes .",
    "the quark masses at the scale @xmath53 @xcite are given in table [ quarkmassesatmwtable ] .",
    "for leptons we neglect the small effects on the masses from electroweak running so that the lepton masses we use at @xmath53 are simply the ones quoted by the pdg @xcite as given in table [ leptonmassesatmwtable ] .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tables [ lma change ] and [ lma change2 ] we present the results for the simulations concerning the number of large mixing angles when the above constraints are imposed .",
    "we see that the probability of two large mixing angles is never dominant . however , this probability is not small either .",
    "depending on the scenario considered and the majorana scale , the percentage ranges from about 4% to 18% as we vary @xmath54 .",
    "there is a general trend in the cases where constraints on the masses are imposed - the percentage is larger when the majorana scale is smaller .",
    "this is readily understandable . when the majorana scale is small , the average element in the mass matrix is comparable to or greater than the resulting mass eigenvalues , because in the seesaw mechanism the masses are proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "when all elements are large , one requires larger mixing angles to diagonalize the mass matrix .",
    "our results are somewhat inconclusive .",
    "one finds solutions with two large mixing angles with a reasonable percentage .",
    "however , it is not the most likely outcome .",
    "statistically , we can not conclude anything significant from a comparison with the observed mixing angles .",
    "this conclusion is independent of how we have modeled the possible randomness of the majorana sector .",
    "we have also found that the information on the neutrino mass differences is unable to tightly constrain the scale of the majorana sector .",
    "we can also extract some predictive elements from our analysis .",
    "we will study these using a majorana scale of @xmath56 . in each case",
    "we also only consider those realistic solutions that satisfy the @xmath57 bounds on the neutrino mass differences as well as the cosmological bound and that have large angles @xmath58 and @xmath59 and values of @xmath60 smaller than the experimental bound , and thus are very similar to the real data .    using these realistic simulations , we have studied the size of the third mixing angle @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath61 is shown in fig .",
    "[ theta13_constrain ] within its @xmath62 allowed range , that is for @xmath63 .",
    "we see that the distribution of @xmath1 is not peaked at low values but rises towards its @xmath64 upper bound , so that there is no reason to expect that the third mixing angle is suppressed .",
    "the median of the distribution is @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the values lie above 0.04 .",
    "we also have studied the neutrino equivalent of the jarlskog invariant that signals the strength of cp violation for lepton number conserving processes the neutrino sector .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ j_neutrinos ] .",
    "here we see that the jarlskog invariant is generally large , of order @xmath2 .",
    "we see that the peak of the distribution is close to its theoretical maximum possible value which is @xmath67 .",
    "the median of the distribution is at 0.016 and 95% of the values are above @xmath68 .",
    "finally we consider the effective majorana mass defined by @xmath69 which is the figure of merit in neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
    "the simulations of this parameter are shown in fig .",
    "[ mee ] again for the realistic case very similar to nature .",
    "we see that the distribution decreases approximately linearly until a value of 0.008 ev , with only very few values higher than that .",
    "these come from cases where the neutrino masses are not strictly hierarchical and the lightest mass is close to the second lightest mass .",
    "the median of the distribution is at 0.0028 ev , 95% are higher than @xmath70 ev .",
    "95% of the values lie below 0.0068 ev which is consistent with other results that expect the effective majorana mass for the case of hierarchical neutrino masses to be smaller than 0.0064 ev @xcite .",
    "a pioneering effort in simulating neutrino mixing angles randomly in the context of the seesaw mechanism was the work of goldman and stephenson in 1981 @xcite .",
    "these authors randomly populated both the dirac and majorana mass matrices with a uniform distribution and found that the typical case involved angles of the same size as the cabibbo angle .",
    "the intent was not to invoke a random dynamical framework but to argue that unless the initial yukawa couplings were peculiar , that we should expect to find cabibbo - like mixing angles .",
    "more recently , the idea has surfaced under the label of `` anarchy '' in the works of @xcite .",
    "these authors build in more of what is now known about the neutrino mass spectrum and , although again one most typically finds cabibbo - like angles , they point out that one finds two large mixing angles ( defined as @xmath71 ) in about 13% of the cases when simulated with a uniform random distribution .",
    "our considerations have been somewhat different .",
    "we have used the dirac component of the neutrino masses to be the same distribution that has been used in the description of the charged leptons and the quarks , and considered various possibilities for the majorana sector . however , our numerical results are fairly similar .",
    "two large mixing angles are found between 5% and 15% of the time as we change @xmath54 and when we consider output masses similar to those needed experimentally .",
    "note that the definition of `` large mixing angles '' is more generous in the anarchy papers ( @xmath72 ) than in our work ( @xmath73 ) . in our simulations",
    "this can make a factor of two difference in the percentage of cases that are said to have two large mixing angles .",
    "for example , with @xmath74  gev , the percentage of two large mixing angle solutions goes from 5.4% to 10.1% when adopting the more generous range .",
    "however , this does not change our conclusions .",
    "large mixing angles are found a significant fraction of the time , but are not the most probable solution .",
    "our work has concentrated on the standard seesaw mechanism .",
    "if considering the type ii seesaw  @xcite or triplet seesaw  @xcite mechanisms instead , the neutrino mass matrix is completely determined by physics at a very high scale for which we have no basis to prefer a certain weight .",
    "this leads to more freedom because of the lack of constraints , but unfortunately also to no predictive power .",
    "we have provided an exploration of the distribution of quark and lepton masses and mixings , treating these as random variables distributed with respect to some probability distribution function , which we called the weight .",
    "we have shown that this weight is close to being scale invariant in form , i.e @xmath0 .",
    "in particular a statistical analysis of power law weights @xmath75 tightly constrains the power to be @xmath76 .",
    "such weights commonly produce small mixing angles and a hierarchy of ckm elements .",
    "our exploration of the neutrino sector was somewhat inconclusive .",
    "the use of the usual seesaw mechanism , combined with the expected weight for the dirac masses , could marginally accommodate the observed mass differences and mixing angles , but the existence of large mixing angles was not a common occurrence in this framework .",
    "however , the neutrino sector does allow us to make statistical predictions of this framework .",
    "a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses is highly favored by the scale invariant weights .",
    "we saw that the leptonic jarlskog invariant is typically of order @xmath2 and with 95% confidence greater than @xmath77 .",
    "the third presently unmeasured mns mixing angle @xmath1 is typically of order 0.1 and with 95% confidence it is larger than 0.04 .",
    "the effective majorana mass @xmath3 is typically of order 0.001 ev .",
    "we are aware of many caveats about this procedure , and there are probably others that we do not enumerate .",
    "some of these issues are :    \\1 ) differences between quarks and leptons : the information that we have about the masses exists at low energy .",
    "however , it is likely that the fundamental input consists of parameters defined at a high energy scale .",
    "we explored the effect of this using only the standard model to run the yukawa couplings to the gut scale , and this did not modify any of our conclusions .",
    "however , we clearly do not know the physics at intermediate scales . if the intermediate physics only produces logarithmic running , the residual effect is also probably not large .",
    "\\2 ) generation structure : the assumption of statistical independence of all masses may fail in some obvious ways .",
    "the most suspect aspect is that we do not assume any correlation between members of the same generation . in some grand unified theories ,",
    "this is incorrect , leading for example to a relation between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 quark masses @xcite .",
    "perhaps in the fundamental theory the random distribution occurs separately for the average value of a generation s masses and for the ratio of masses .",
    "this pattern is distinct from that which we have assumed .",
    "\\3 ) anthropic constraints : in a landscape picture there are inevitable anthropic constraints .",
    "some parameter sets that occur in the landscape do not allow the existence of life , and hence we could not find ourselves in a portion of the multiverse where these parameters occurred .",
    "these constraints may distort the mass distribution .",
    "we have provided an estimate of this effect in the discussion of quark and lepton masses , and it appears not to change our qualitative conclusions .",
    "we have not considered a possible anthropic constraint on neutrino masses  @xcite , which would disfavor masses above 1  ev . in general , it is hard to fully explore the effect of anthropic constraints without having the full fundamental theory .",
    "\\4 ) other flavor symmetries : many of the attempts to understand quark and lepton masses have focussed on adding extra flavor symmetries to the standard model .",
    "our basic assumption asserts that vacua with these extra symmetries do not constitute a large part of the string theory landscape of vacua .    from these comments",
    ", it is clear that our investigation is a rather preliminary attempt at phenomenology in the context of the landscape . in the end ,",
    "the only fully compelling procedure is to identify the fundamental theory , such as string theory , that leads to the landscape and fully solve it . with this solution in hand",
    "one can investigate directly those vacua that lead to the standard model and calculate the statistical features of those solutions .",
    "then one can directly address the constraints and symmetries that occur due to intermediate scale physics and can assess whether the fundamental theory is statistically compatible with the data .",
    "however , such a `` top down '' solution is clearly very difficult and we are far from being able to accomplish it . in the meantime",
    "we need to tentatively explore the phenomenology from the `` bottom up '' as best we are able .",
    "it is hoped that eventually this weight can be calculated from a more fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "an illustrative example was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the intersecting brane worlds ( ibw ) construction of the standard model @xcite . there",
    ", the yukawa couplings arise from the a non - perturbative effect spanning the area between the intersections of three pairs of branes ( @xmath80 ) , with the yukawa interactions being exponentially suppressed in that area , @xmath81 up to a phase . in this case a flat distribution in the area @xmath82 yields the scale invariant weight in masses .",
    "the range in the allowed values of the area translates into a finite range in the masses .",
    "it is possible that this exponential behavior could be a more general feature of the landscape .",
    "of course , this relation does not fully explain the nearly scale invariant distribution in the masses , but only transfers the problem to the string scale to understand whether the distribution in the area is nearly flat .",
    "it would be interesting to explore possible dynamics that could produce an ensemble of standard model string vacua and assess the resulting effect on the distribution of masses .",
    "we would like to thank guy blaylock for valuable discussions . this work has been supported in part by the u.s . national science foundation .",
    "when we consider the neutrino masses by themselves without mixing , the light neutrino masses @xmath23 are of the form @xmath84 where we take @xmath85 as a common scale . using the scale invariant weight @xmath86 for the dirac masses , we derive the weight for the neutrino mass differences @xmath87 and use the physical data for a likelihood fit of the majorana scale @xmath85 .    as a first step",
    "let we calculate the weight for the neutrino masses @xmath23 with the scale invariant random dirac masses @xmath88 : @xmath89 where we defined @xmath90 and @xmath91 for simplicity .",
    "we see that the neutrino masses are also distributed with respect to a scale invariant weight .",
    "the lower and upper bounds are of course changed as we would expect and the result in eq .",
    "( [ pdfnetrinomasses ] ) is automatically normalized since we started from a normalized weight .      with",

    "the weight for @xmath97 is basically proportional to one over @xmath97 up to some logarithmic corrections . for the complete weight @xmath98 ,",
    "we need to include the range of possible values of @xmath97 with a theta function : @xmath99 again , we find that our result is automatically normalized .",
    "recall that we defined @xmath90 and @xmath91 so that @xmath98 depends on the majorana scale @xmath85 as well as on @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "our analytic result for @xmath98 agrees exactly with the result of corresponding simulations .    one benefit of explicitly knowing the weight of an observable is that one can perform a likelihood fit with it .",
    "if we used the weight for @xmath83 along with the physical data for @xmath102 and @xmath103 to fit the majorana scale @xmath85 using a likelihood function @xmath104 , we would make a mistake by assuming the two measured mass differences are independent of each other .",
    "therefore we have to first calculate the weight for two neutrino mass differences @xmath105 that takes the correlation into account : @xmath106 \\notag \\\\                                        & { } \\hspace*{68pt }                                          \\theta \\ !",
