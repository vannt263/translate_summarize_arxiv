    "in particular , the number density of clusters as a function of mass and redshift , i.e. , the mass function , is strongly related to the mean matter density @xmath12 and the power spectrum amplitude @xmath13 ( e.g. , voit 2005 ; vikhlinin et al .",

    ", this method suffers from strong projection effects and is observationally expensive . in x - rays , by measuring the gas density and temperature profiles , the mass can be derived assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) , which can underestimate the mass by @xmath14 due to non - thermal pressure support ( e.g. , nagai et al . 2007 ; piffaretti & valdarnini 2008 ; jeltema et al .",

    "an x - ray agn was detected in the @xmath49 kev band at the center of g036n in the  image ( figure 1 , right panel ) , while no point source was detected at the center of g036s .",
    "interestingly , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) image ( right panel of figure 3 ) also reveals a radio source , nvss j180431 + 100323 , coincident with the center of g036n .",

    "surface brightness profiles for each subcluster were extracted from the background subtracted and exposure corrected images .",
    "we chose a half circular region opposite to the interaction region ( see figure 4 ) to derive the surface brightness profiles for both g036n and g036s .",
    "the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles are shown in figure 5 .",
    "we first tried to model these with single @xmath51 models ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , @xmath52^{-3\\beta+1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the core radius .",
    "we found excess emission in the central @xmath0@xmath54 regions for both g036n and g036s , so we excluded the radial bins covering the central @xmath0@xmath54 regions and refit the surface brightness profiles .",
    "the best fitting @xmath51 models are plotted in figure 5 , with the best fitting parameters given in table 1 .",

    "show excess emission relative to the @xmath51 models .",
    "note that the x - ray agn at the center of g036n is not excluded in the surface brightness profiles .",
    "compared to the surface brightness profile of g036s , it can be inferred that the contribution from the x - ray agn to the total flux from g036n is negligible .",
    "we further demonstrate this from the spectral analysis in section 4.4 . given the quality of the data and the goodness of the @xmath51 model beyond the central @xmath010@xmath58 regions , we did not try more complicated models .",
    "we also extracted surface brightness profiles in different wedge - shaped regions , trying to identify surface brightness discontinuities , but the current data do not reveal any unambiguous edges .",
    "the background level is quiescent throughout the  observation , so we simply used the period f blank - sky background as our baseline background model .",
    "in addition , to check how sensitive the results are to the background variation ( with time and/or location ) , we varied the background level by @xmath245% ( by changing the backscal keyword by @xmath595% ) , and added a soft - band adjustment by fitting the spectrum from a ( largely ) source - free region near the edge of the ccd ( figure 4 , right panel ) with an unabsorbed thermal model ( best fitting @xmath60 kev ) allowing the normalization to be negative ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we treated the uncertainty in the background subtraction as a systematic uncertainty ( see section 4.6 ) .",
    "as the  data were affected by periods of high energy particle induced background ( section 2.2 ) , there may be residual sp contamination even after flare screening .",
    "thus we decided to model the various components of the background as in snowden & kuntz ( 2013 ) .",
    "the  background is very complex ( e.g. , nevalainen et al . 2005 ; carter & read 2007 ; leccardi & molendi 2008 ) , but can be separated into three components : instrumental background , cosmic background , and solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) background .",
    "the instrumental background contains qpb ( quiescent particle background ) , instrumental lines , and residual sp ( soft proton ) contamination .",
    "the qpb component can be easily subtracted using the filter wheel closed ( fwc ) data .",
    "the instrumental lines are dominated by the epic mos al k@xmath61 ( @xmath01.49 kev ) , epic mos si k@xmath61 ( @xmath01.75 kev ) , epic pn al k@xmath61 ( @xmath01.49 kev ) , and ( six ) epic pn cu ( @xmath08 kev ) lines .",
    "we set an upper limit of 7.0 kev for epic pn spectra , leaving only three instrumental lines , which were modeled as three gaussians with zero width .",
    "the residual sp contamination was modeled as a power law not folded through the instrumental effective areas , with the indices linked together for the epic mos cameras .",
    "the cosmic background was modeled as three components : an unabsorbed thermal component with @xmath62 kev , representing the emission from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) or heliosphere ; an absorbed thermal component , allowing the temperature to vary , representing the emission from the hotter galactic halo and/or the intergalactic medium ; and an absorbed power - law with the index fixed at 1.46 representing the background from unresolved cosmological sources .",
    "both the absorbed and unabsorbed thermal components have zero redshift and solar abundance .",
    "the swcx background only produces line emission , with the strongest lines being o vii ( @xmath00.57 kev ) and o viii ( @xmath00.65 kev ) lines .",
    "we set a lower energy cutoff of 0.7 kev , so that the swcx background can be neglected .",
    "the normalizations of the various components of the background were determined by simultaneously fitting the spectra from the global cluster regions ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "we define seven regions for the global spectral fitting : core ( small circle , 35@xmath58 in radius ) , cluster ( ellipse ) , cluster minus core , for both g036n and g036s , and a large annulus ( 480@xmath58 - 720@xmath58 in radii ) free of cluster emission .",
    "the normalizations of the cosmic background components , together with the normalization of the source spectrum ( a single absorbed thermal model ) , were computed in units of arcmin@xmath63 .",
    "all the normalizations of the background components were left as free parameters in the global spectral fitting , and were fixed in the subsequent spectral analysis ( e.g. , temperature profile ) , accounting for the solid angle .",
    "the temperature of the absorbed cosmic background component and the indices of the residual sp contamination were also fixed at the best fitting values in the subsequent spectral analysis .",
    "since  is located at low galactic latitude ( @xmath64 ) , we expect the total hydrogen column density , @xmath65 , to be higher than the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) h i survey ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) value of @xmath66 cm@xmath63 , due to additional absorption by molecular hydrogen .",
    "indeed , the best fitting @xmath65 obtained by the global spectral fitting is @xmath68 cm@xmath63 for , @xmath69 cm@xmath63 for  ( baseline background model and baseline background model varied by @xmath245% ) , and @xmath70 cm@xmath63 if a soft - band adjustment is added to the  baseline background model .    and  give significantly different @xmath65 , by almost a factor of two . to investigate the origin of this discrepancy , we refit the spectra with energy cutoffs of 0.3 kev , 0.5 kev , 0.7 kev and 1.5 kev .",
    "the best fitting @xmath65 values are all consistent for each observatory , but still significantly different between the two observatories .",
    "we also tried different abundance tables , and found that while @xmath65 changes with different abundance tables , the ratio between the two observatories remains almost unchanged .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the discrepancy is most likely caused by cross - calibration issues ( see section 4.6 on their effects on the total mass determinations ) .",
    "to examine whether @xmath65 is different between g036n and g036s , and whether @xmath65 changes with radius , we fit all spectra ( section 4.4 ) of g036n and g036s with @xmath65 free in each annulus .",
    "we found that all the @xmath65 values are consistent within the @xmath22 errors for , and consistent within the @xmath71 errors for .",
    "therefore , in our spectral analysis we linked @xmath65 in different regions together .",
    "in addition , we estimated the total @xmath65 with the relation @xmath72 where @xmath73 cm@xmath63 , @xmath74 is the dust extinction , @xmath75 cm@xmath63 , and @xmath76 ( willingale et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath77 cm@xmath63 .",

    "we treated the uncertainty in @xmath65 as a systematic uncertainty ( see section 4.6 ) .",
    "the only redshift available for  is from the cluster in the zone of avoidance ( ciza ) project , which measured a spectroscopic redshift @xmath82 ( ebeling et al .",

    "the spectroscopically derived mass deposition rate ( see section 4.8 ) confirms this scenario .",
    "it is interesting to ask what causes the difference between the cores of the two subclusters .",
    "one possibility is that the ongoing merger has disrupted a pre - existing cool - core in g036s ( e.g. , sanderson et al .",
    "2006 ; burns et al .",
    "2008 ; rossetti & molendi 2010 ; but see , e.g. , poole et al .",
    "2008 ) . from table 4 ,",
    "the merger began @xmath252 gyr ago based on the simplified merger model ( section 5.1 ) , while the time for the shock to propagate to the center of g036n ( g036s ) , @xmath253 ( @xmath254 ) , @xmath255 , is @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) gyr obtained from , and is @xmath258 ( @xmath259 ) gyr from , respectively .",
    "taken at face value ,  favors a scenario in which the shock has passed the cores of the two subclusters , while the situation for  is less clear .    to further examine this question , we divided the central @xmath169 annular region of g036n into two equal area half annular regions , with the symmetry axis perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the two subclusters .",
    "we compared the derived temperatures in the two half annular and full annular regions , finding them to be consistent within their @xmath22 errors .",
    "we then varied the outer radius , i.e. , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 ( maximum outer radius avoiding the interaction region , see figure 7 ) , performed the same analysis , and found that all the temperatures are consistent within their @xmath22 errors ( although in some cases the temperature in the half annular region near the interaction region was poorly constrained ) .",
    "two possibilities can explain this : ( i ) the shock has not reached the central @xmath0@xmath54 region of g036n ; ( ii ) the shock has passed the central @xmath0@xmath54 region of g036n , but the core is dense enough not to be destroyed .",
    "we now show that possibility ( ii ) is less likely .",
    "we first applied the same method to g036s , but the data quality is poorer and all the temperatures are consistent given the large uncertainties .",
    "notice that @xmath188 , @xmath200 , @xmath146 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 for g036n and g036s are all similar ( tables 3 and 4 ) , so we expect that the shock travels similar distances in g036n and g036s at any given time . as a result ,",
    "if the shock has reached the core of g036n , it should also have reached the core of g036s .",
    "the pressure ratio , @xmath266 , where @xmath267 and @xmath268 are the mean pressures in the central @xmath169 region of g036n and in the central @xmath248 region of g036s respectively , although with large uncertainty , is consistent with 1 .",
    "this implies that , if possibility ( ii ) is correct , the core of g036s should also have survived the merger induced shock , in contradiction with observations .",
    "thus , the consistent temperatures in the two half annular regions and in their parent regions in the core of g036n imply that the shock probably has not reached the core , so the lack of gas cooling in the core of g036s is unlikely caused by the merger disrupting a pre - existing cool - core in g036s .",
    "this is also consistent with our previous expectation of an early stage of the merger , suggesting that the simplified model in section 5.1 overestimates the time since the merger began .",
    "the actual time since the merger began is probably less than @xmath3 gyr ( see table 4 ) .    for cool - core clusters",
    ", some heating mechanisms must be taking place to prevent the gas from catactrophic cooling ( see fabian 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the bcg of g036n hosts a radio source ( section 3.1 ) , with a flux density of 19.7 mjy and a 1.4 ghz luminosity ( @xmath269 ) of @xmath270 w hz@xmath17 after the @xmath99-correction ( singal et al .",
    "2011 ) assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath271 is defined as @xmath272 , where @xmath273 is the flux density at frequency @xmath274 . ]",
    "( condon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the extent of the radio source is comparable to the angular resolution of the nvss ( @xmath50 , @xmath0120 kpc at the cluster redshift , see right panel of figure 3 ) . if it is an extended source , i.e. , with radio lobes filled with relativistic particles and magnetic fields ( e.g. , brzan et al .",
    "2008 ) , there may be undetected cavities , which are generally thought to play a key role in the `` radio mode '' feedback ( e.g. , bower et al . 2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; sijacki et al .",
    "2007 ) in clusters of galaxies ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 , 2012 ; fabian 2012 ; and references therein ) . using the scaling relation in cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we estimated the cavity power , @xmath275 erg s@xmath17 , based on the 1.4 ghz luminosity .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the cool - core is @xmath276 erg s@xmath17 , @xmath277 times larger than @xmath278 .",
    "studies of large samples show that although in some cases the cavity power is smaller than the x - ray luminosity , on average it is energetic enough to balance the cooling ( e.g. , rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ; brzan et al .",
    "2008 ; dunn & fabian 2008 ; cavagnolo et al .",
    "higher resolution radio data are required to confirm the extended nature of the radio source , and deeper  observations are also necessary to identify any cavities in the core of g036n .",
    "sun ( 2009 ) studied a sample of 161 bcgs and 74 strong radio agns ( @xmath279 w hz@xmath17 ) in 152 nearby ( @xmath280 ) clusters and groups using  archive data .",
    "he found that all bcgs with @xmath281 w hz@xmath17 in the sample have cool - cores .",
    "although with a higher redshift , g036n is also consistent with his finding .    to conclude , g036n hosts a small , moderate cool - core , while g036s has at most a very weak cool - core .",
    "this difference is unlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger .",
    "g036n also hosts a central radio source , which may be heating the gas if the radio source is extended .",
    "examination of the temperature variations in the core of g036n also suggests that the simplified merger dynamical model presented in section 5.1 overestimates the time since the merger began , which should be less than @xmath3 gyr .",
    "we present  and  observations of  from the -  legacy program .",
    "the x - ray images reveal two close ( in projection ) , yet clearly separated subclusters , g036n and g036s ( figure 1 ) ; spectral analysis yields similar redshifts for the two subclusters ( section 4.3 ) and a higher temperature between them ( section 4.7 ) , confirming that they are interacting . excluding the interaction region , the morphologies of g036n and g036s do not deviate significantly from spherical symmetry ( figure 1 ) and the surface brightness profiles can be well described by single @xmath51 models beyond the central @xmath0@xmath54 regions ( figure 5 and table 1 ) , suggesting that the merger is still at an early stage .",
    "the bcgs of the two subclusters are very close to the x - ray centers ( figure 3 ) , consistent with an early stage of the merger , and in favor of a merger mostly along the line - of - sight .",
    "a simplified dynamical model suggests that the merger began about 0.8 gyr ago , with an angle between the merger axis and the plane of the sky of @xmath282 ( section 5.1 ) , in accordance with our expectations .",
    "surface brightness profiles ( figure 5 ) and temperature profiles ( figure 6 ) indicate that the gas may be cooling in the cores of both subclusters . by calculating the cooling time ,",
    "we conclude that g036n hosts a small , moderate cool - core , while g036s has at most a very weak cool - core . based on the temperature variations in the core of g036n",
    ", we suggest that the difference in core cooling times between g036n and g036s is unlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger ( section 5.3 ) .",
    "the temperature variations also indicate that the simplified model ( section 5.1 ) overestimates the time since the merger began , which is probably less than @xmath3 gyr .",
    "interestingly , the bcg of g036n hosts an unresolved radio source ( figure 3 ) .",
    "if the radio source is extended , the  radio mode \" agn feedback may be taking place in the core of g036n . using the 1.4 ghz luminosity , we estimate a cavity power about @xmath277 times smaller than the x - ray luminosity of the core of g036n .",
    "higher resolution radio data and deeper x - ray data are necessary to study the nature of the radio source and the physical processes in the core , e.g. , jet / icm interaction .",
    "since the merger is probably at an early stage , we apply the hydrostatic equation to the icm in the regions opposite to the interaction region to obtain the total mass ( section 4.5 ) .",
    "we treat the uncertainties in hydrogen column density ( section 4.2 ) , redshift ( section 4.3 ) ,  background subtraction methods ( section 4.1.2 ) , and other  and  cross - calibration uncertainties as systematic uncertainties ( section 4.6 ) .",
    "we find that  gives a slightly higher total mass than , although the difference is not significant ( section 4.6 ) .",
    "we also compare the x - ray mass to the sz mass ( section 5.2 ) .",
    "the sz mass is higher than the x - ray mass of either subcluster , but is lower than the x - ray mass of the whole cluster , which is caused by the fact that  does not resolve  into two subclusters and interprets it as a single cluster .    despite the short exposure times of the  and  observations and large systematic uncertainties , we were able to infer the basic merger kinematics and some useful time scales based on the morphologies and core properties , from which we further estimate the total masses of the constituent subclusters and the whole cluster .",
    "they are all self - consistent .",
    "obviously , deeper x - ray data and multiwavelength observations as well as targeted simulations are required to study this interesting system in greater detail .    as the angular resolution of  is substantially coarser than those of  and , it can not resolve closely interacting subclusters or close cluster pairs . because of the size - flux degeneracy ,  has to use the x - ray determined position and radius to refine the sz flux measurement ( e.g. , planck collaboration xxix 2014 ) .",
    "much of this information comes from mcxc , which collects cluster parameters from publicly available  all - sky survey based and serendipitous based catalogues ( piffaretti et al . 2011 ) .",
    "these catalogues usually consist of observations too shallow to resolve clusters in much detail .",
    "consequently , clusters with small projected separations might not be resolved and are treated as a single cluster , which is then adopted by mcxc and . if such close clusters occupy a considerable fraction , the consequence is that the  all - sky survey will overestimate the number of massive clusters .",
    "using this biased mass function to constrain cosmological parameter will result in lower @xmath12 and higher @xmath13 .",
    "thus , higher resolution x - ray observations by  and  of the  cluster sample are necessary to identify the fraction of previously unresolved clusters like  and correct for this bias before applying the  sz mass function to constrain cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> the high resolution x - ray observations reveal two close ( @xmath0@xmath1 kpc in projection ) subclusters , g036n and g036s , which were not resolved by previous , optical , or recent  observations . </S>",
    "<S> we perform detailed imaging and spectral analyses and use a simplified model to study the kinematics of this system . </S>",
    "<S> the basic picture is that  is undergoing a major merger ( mass ratio close to unity ) between the two massive subclusters , with the merger largely along the line - of - sight ( @xmath0@xmath2 between the merger axis and the plane of the sky from the simplified model ) and probably at an early stage ( less than @xmath3 gyr since the merger began ) . </S>",
    "<S> g036n hosts a small ( @xmath027 kpc ) , moderate cool - core ( cooling time @xmath4 gyr ) , while g036s has at most a very weak cool - core ( @xmath5 gyr ) in the central @xmath0@xmath6 kpc region . the difference in core cooling times is unlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger disrupting a pre - existing cool - core in g036s . </S>",
    "<S> g036n also hosts an unresolved radio source in the center , which may be heating the gas if the radio source is extended . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of the whole cluster determined from  is @xmath7 @xmath8 , and is @xmath9 @xmath8 from . </S>",
    "<S> the  derived mass , @xmath10 @xmath8 , is higher than the x - ray measured mass of either subcluster , but is lower than the x - ray measured mass of the whole cluster , due to the fact that  does not resolve  into subclusters and interprets it as a single cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this mass discrepancy could induce significant bias to the mass function if such previously unresolved systems are common in the  cluster sample . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution x - ray observations are necessary to identify the fraction of such systems and correct such a bias for the purpose of precision cosmological studies . </S>"
