    "in recent years , microwave ( millimeter and sub - millimeter wave ) technologies , covering frequencies from 10  ghz to 10  thz ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) , have become the focus of intensive efforts in many fields of research . in engineering and medicine ,",
    "thz imaging represents one of the next - generation technologies , enabling non - destructive materials inspection , chemical composition analysis  @xcite , and medical diagnoses  @xcite . in the fundamental sciences , physics , chemistry and biology , microwave spectroscopy is also very useful for investigating the physical properties of a material",
    "this is particularly true for the sub - field of condensed matter physics , where the millimeter and sub - millimeter spectral range can provide extremely rich information concerning the basic electronic characteristics of a material  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , combining microwave techniques and high magnetic fields ( microwave magneto - optics ) , allows many more possibilities , including : cyclotron resonance ( cr )  @xcite ; electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr )  @xcite ; antiferromagnetic resonance ( afmr )  @xcite ; josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) measurements of layered superconductors  @xcite ; and many others . in each of these examples",
    ", the magnetic field influences the dynamics of electrons at frequencies spanning the microwave spectral range .",
    "another very important aspect of microwave magneto - optical investigations is the possibility to study angle dependent effects by controlling the angle between the sample and the microwave and dc electromagnetic fields .",
    "for instance , through studies of the angle dependence of cr amplitudes , one can extract detailed information concerning the fermi surface ( fs ) topology of a conductor  @xcite .",
    "consequently , angle - dependent microwave spectroscopy has been widely used in recent years to study highly anisotropic magnetic and conducting materials .",
    "problems which have been addressed using these methods include : high - tc superconductivity  @xcite , and other low - dimensional superconductors , e.g. organic conductors  @xcite , sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9  @xcite , etc . ; the quantum and fractional quantum hall effects  @xcite ; and low - dimensional magnets , including single - molecule magnets ( smms )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the microwave spectral range presents many technical challenges , particularly when trying to study very tiny ( @xmath10  mm@xmath11 ) single - crystal samples within the restricted space inside the bore of a large high - field magnet system ( either resistive or superconducting  @xcite ) .",
    "problems associated with the propagation system stem from standing waves and/or losses  @xcite .",
    "several methods have been well documented for alleviating some of these issues , including the use of fundamental te and tm mode rectangular metallic waveguides , low - loss cylindrical corrugated he waveguides  @xcite , quasi - optical propagation systems  @xcite , and in - situ generation and detection of the microwaves  @xcite .",
    "standing waves are particularly problematic in the case of broadband spectroscopies , e.g. time - domain  @xcite and fourier transform techniques  @xcite , as well as for frequency sweepable monochromatic sources  @xcite . in these instances , the optical properties are usually deduced via reflectivity or transmission measurements , requiring a large well - defined ( i.e. flat ) sample surface area ( @xmath12 ) . for cases in which large samples are not available ( note : @xmath13 spans from 3  cm at 10  ghz to 0.3  mm at 1  thz ) , resonant techniques become necessary , e.g. cavity perturbation  @xcite .",
    "this unfortunately limits measurements to the modes of the cavity .",
    "in addition , making absolute measurements of the optical constants of a sample , as a function of frequency , is extremely difficult to achieve using cavity perturbation because of its narrow - band nature  @xcite .",
    "however , the cavity perturbation technique is ideally suited for fixed - frequency , magnetic resonance measurements  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as we have recently shown , it is possible to make measurements at many different frequencies by working on higher order modes of the cavity  @xcite . to date , measurements in enclosed cylindrical copper cavities have been possible at frequencies up to 350  ghz ( see sec .",
    "[ smm ] ) .",
    "the standard approach for studying angle - dependent effects using the cavity perturbation technique is to use a split - pair magnet and/or goniometers , and is widely used in lower frequency commercial epr instruments , e.g. x - band , k - band and q - band  @xcite . in the case of the split - pair approach ,",
    "the dc magnetic field is rotated with respect to a static waveguide / cavity assembly .",
    "in this paper , we outline a method for in - situ rotation of part of a cylindrical resonator , thus enabling angle - dependent cavity perturbation measurements in ultra - high - field magnets , and two - axis rotation capabilities in standard high - field superconducting split - pair magnets .",
    "as we shall outline , the rotation mechanism preserves the cylindrical symmetry of the measurement , thereby ensuring that the electromagnetic coupling to the microwave fields does not change upon rotating the sample .",
    "this is particularly important for studies of low - dimensional conductors , where sample rotation alone ( as in the case of a goniometer ) would lead to unwanted instrumental artifacts associated with incommensurate symmetries of the sample and cavity .",
    "the available frequency range in the setup developed at the university of florida ( uf ) spans from 8  ghz up to @xmath14  ghz ( 0.27 - 23  @xmath7 ) .",
    "experiments are possible in dc magnetic fields of up to 17 tesla , and at temperatures in the range from @xmath15  kelvin at uf .",
    "furthermore , all experimental probes and techniques developed at uf , including the ones described in this article , are also compatible with the 45  tesla resistive magnets at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) in tallahassee , fl .",
    "we note that a rotating cavity has previously been developed by schrama et al .",
    "@xcite , at the university of oxford , also for high - field microwave studies .",
    "as we will demonstrate in this article , the cylindrical geometry offers many advantages over the rectangular design implemented by the oxford group .",
    "for example , the waveguides are coupled rigidly to the cylindrical body of the cavity in our design ( only the end - plate rotates ) , whereas the coupling is varied upon rotation in the oxford version , resulting in effective  blind - spots \" , i.e. angles where the microwave fields in the waveguides do not couple to the cavity ; in contrast , the cylindrical version offers full @xmath16 rotation .",
    "furthermore , the rigid design offers greater mechanical stability and , therefore , less microwave leakage from the cavity , resulting in improved signal - to - noise characteristics  @xcite .",
    "the te01@xmath17 cylindrical modes also offer the advantage that no ac currents flow between the curved surfaces and flat rotating end - plate of the cylindrical resonator .",
    "consequently , the moving part of the cavity does not compromise the exceptionally high quality ( @xmath18 ) factors associated with these modes .",
    "indeed , @xmath18factors for the first few te@xmath19 modes vary from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( at low temperatures ) , as opposed to just @xmath22 for the rectangular cavities .",
    "this order of magnitude improvement translates into vastly increased sensitivity , enabling e.g. , epr studies of extremely small single crystal samples .",
    "finally , the cylindrical cavity is machined entirely from copper , and held rigidly together entirely by screws .",
    "this all - copper construction results in negligible field sensitivity , i.e. the field dependence of the cavity parameters is essentially flat and , most importantly , the cavities do not contain any paramagnetic impurities that could give rise to spurious magnetic resonance signals .    in the next section ,",
    "the detailed features of the rotating cavity are described , and some example data obtained with the rotating cavity will be shown in the following section .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the case of the te011 mode , the low - temperature ( @xmath23  k ) @xmath24-factor is @xmath25 , and the contrast between the amplitude on resonance [ a(@xmath26 ) ] and the amplitude far from resonance ( leak amplitude , a@xmath27 ) is 31.7db .",
    "these parameters are essentially the same as the optimum values reported for the fixed cylindrical geometry in our earlier paper  @xcite , thus confirming the suitability of this new rotating design for cavity perturbation studies of small single - crystal samples , both insulating and conducting .",
    "we note that the @xmath24-value for the non - cylindrically symmetric mode in table  [ tab : resonances ] ( te212 ) is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of the te011 mode .",
    "as noted above , this is due to the flow of microwave currents associated with the te212 mode across the mechanical connection between the main body of the resonator and the end - plate .    as discussed earlier ,",
    "even though the end - plate can be rotated , the waveguides are coupled absolutely rigidly to the cavity via the stage . as with earlier designs  @xcite ,",
    "the microwave fields in the waveguides are coupled into the resonator by means of small circular coupling holes which are drilled through the sidewalls of the cavity .",
    "the sizes of these coupling holes [ diameter = 0.038 `` ( = 0.97  mm ) , or @xmath28 have been optimized for the v - band , and the cavity side - wall was milled down to a thickness of 0.015 '' ( = 0.38  mm , or @xmath29 ) at the location of these holes . once again , these numbers are essentially the same as those reported in ref .",
    "the key point here is that this coupling never changes during rotation .",
    "therefore , the full 360@xmath30 angle range may be explored , and with excellent mechanical stability .",
    "5 shows the typical random fluctuations in the cavity resonance parameters for the te@xmath19 mode during a complete @xmath4 rotation of the end - plate : the center frequency varies by no more than @xmath31  khz ( @xmath32  ppm , or @xmath33 of the resonance width ) ; the @xmath24-factor is essentially constant , to within @xmath34 ; and the contrast , [ a(@xmath35a@xmath27 ] , fluctuates between 29  db to 33  db , corresponding respectively to leak amplitudes of @xmath37 and @xmath38 of a(@xmath39 .",
    "( a )  a polar plot of the complex signal transmitted through the cavity as the frequency is swept through the te011 mode ; the polar coordinate represents the phase of the transmitted signal , while the radial coordinate corresponds to the linear amplitude . the lorentzian resonance is observed as a circle in the complex plane .",
    "points close to the origin correspond to frequencies far from resonance , while the resonance frequency corresponds to the point on the circle furthest from the origin .",
    "the resonance parameters are obtained from fits ( solid line ) to the data ( open circles ) in the complex plane ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed explanation of this procedure ) .",
    "the average center frequency , @xmath26 , is 51.863  ghz , and the @xmath24 factor is 21600 .",
    "( b )  full @xmath4 angle - dependence of the fluctuations in the resonance parameters for the te011 mode : upper panel @xmath40 @xmath26 ; center panel @xmath40 @xmath24 ; and lower panel @xmath40 difference between the amplitude on resonance [ @xmath41 ) ] and the amplitude far from resonance ( the leak amplitude , @xmath42 ) .",
    "these data illustrate the excellent reproducibility of the resonance parameters upon un - clamping , rotating , and re - clamping the cavity.,width=70 ]    another important consequence of coupling through the side walls of the cavity involves selection rules for tm cylindrical cavity modes . at the lowest frequencies , only the te01 mode of the v - band waveguide propagates .",
    "thus , the microwave @xmath43 field in the waveguide is polarized parallel to the cavity axis , i.e. it is incompatible with the symmetry associated with the @xmath43 patterns of the tm modes .",
    "consequently , we do not observe , for example , the tm111 mode .",
    "this offers added benefit , since the tm@xmath44 modes are ordinarily degenerate with the te@xmath19 modes , and steps have to be taken to either lift these degeneracies , or to suppress the tm modes all together  @xcite . here",
    ", we simply do not couple to these modes at the lowest frequencies . even at the highest frequencies ,",
    "we do not expect coupling to tm modes , provided the polarization of the microwave sources is maintained throughout the waveguide .",
    "the main design challenge in the development of a useful rotating cavity system concerned the space constraints imposed by the high - field magnets at the nhmfl ; the specifications of each magnet system are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "a prototype configuration was first developed , based on a @xmath45 outer tube diameter .",
    "this prototype was subsequently implemented in both magnet systems at uf , and in the 25  t , 50  mm bore resistive magnets at the nhmfl . a picture of this cavity system , which remains in use , is shown in fig .",
    "the major reason for the large size of the cavity assembly is the large worm drive diameter ( @xmath46  mm ) , which is determined by the smallest readily available commercial components  @xcite ; this 1st generation worm drive is made of nylon .",
    "a more compact 2nd generation rotating cavity was developed by machining a considerably smaller custom worm drive ( and gear ) in - house .",
    "this cavity assembly , which is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , is small enough to fit into a 3/4 \" diameter thin - walled stainless steel tube , thus enabling measurements in the highest field 45  t hybrid magnet at the nhmfl .",
    "furthermore , this cavity is compatible with the @xmath11he probe constructed for the 17  t oxford instruments superconducting magnet ( and the 25  t resistive magnet at the nhmfl ) , allowing for experiments at temperatures down to 500  mk .",
    "we note that the 1st and 2nd generation cavity assemblies may be transferred relatively easily from one particular waveguide probe to another , requiring only that the thermometry be unglued and re - glued to the stage using ge varnish ; all other connections are made with screws .",
    "in addition , we have constructed extra parts for both designs , including several cavities and end - plates .",
    "this enables preparation of a new experiment while an existing experiment is in progress .",
    "finally , we discuss the two - axis rotation capabilities made available via a 7  t quantum design ( qd ) magnet ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . the 7  t transverse qd system is outfitted with a rotation stage at the neck of the dewar . a collar clamped around the top of the waveguide probe mounts onto this rotation stage when the probe is inserted into the ppms flow - cryostat  @xcite .",
    "the rotator is driven by a computer controlled stepper motor , with @xmath47 angle resolution .",
    "the motor control has the advantage that it can be automated and , therefore , programmed to perform measurements at many angles over an extended period of time without supervision . in the @xmath48  ghz range ,",
    "the compact schottky diodes can be used for microwave generation and detection .",
    "these devices are mounted directly to the probe , and are linked to the mvna via flexible coaxial cables ( feeding the diodes with a signal in the @xmath49  ghz range ) .",
    "therefore , the waveguide probe can rotate with the source and detector rigidly connected , while the vacuum integrity of the flow cryostat is maintained via two sliding ` o'-ring seals at the top of the dewar .",
    "in fact , this arrangement rotates so smoothly that it is possible to perform fixed - field cavity perturbation measurements as a function of the field orientation , as has recently been demonstrated for the organic conductor @xmath50-(bedt - ttf)@xmath51khg(scn)@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "we generally use the stepper - motor to control the polar coordinate , while mechanical control of the cavity end - plate is used to vary the plane of rotation , i.e. the azimuthal coordinate .    due to the extremely precise control over both angles , and",
    "because of the need for such precision in recent experiments on single - molecule magnets which exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the field orientation  @xcite , we have found it necessary to make two modifications to the 3/4 `` rotating cavity probe for the purposes of two - axis rotation experiments .",
    "the first involves constraining the cavity assembly and the waveguides within a 3/4 '' thin - walled stainless steel tube which is rigidly connected to the top of the probe .",
    "this tube reduces any possible effects caused by magnetic torque about the probe axis , which could mis - align the cavity relative to the rotator .",
    "the second modification involves attaching a spindle on the under - side of the end - cap .",
    "this spindle locates into a centering ring attached to the bottom of the ppms flow - cryostat , thus preventing the waveguide probe from rotating off - axis ( note that the inner diameter of the cryostat is 1.10 `` as opposed to the 3/4 '' outer diameter of the probe ) .",
    "in this section , we present two examples of unique experiments which were recently performed using the rotating cavity . we also assess the performance of the instrument .",
    "[ [ high - field - angle - dependent - cyclotron - resonance - in - kappa - et_2cuncs_2 ] ] high - field angle - dependent cyclotron resonance in @xmath53-(et)@xmath51cu(ncs)@xmath51 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    one of the greatest benefits of the rotating cavity is the possibility to perform angle - dependent electrodynamic studies in the high - field magnets at the nhmfl .",
    "microwave absorption in a magnetic field can be used to gain important information about the fermi surfaces and other fingerprints associated with the itinerant electrons in many materials of current fundamental and technological interest , particularly low - dimensional conductors and superconductors .",
    "these measurements typically require the ability orient the magnetic field relative to a single - crystal sample .",
    "this can easily be achieved at a low fields by rotating a horizontal field magnet , changing the currents in orthogonal helmholtz magnet pairs , or by rotating the entire measurement apparatus in a split solenoid with radial access . however , these approaches are currently limited by the available magnets to fields below about 10  t. while relatively high - field split - pair magnets are planned in the future at the nhmfl , these will still be limited to roughly 20  t , since the split dramatically reduces the attainable field .",
    "thus , an in - situ sample rotation capability is essential for very high - field studies . in this section ,",
    "we highlight these capabilities using as an example the observation of a novel form of quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) cyclotron resonance ( cr ) in a low - dimensional organic conductor  @xcite .    the organic charge - transfer - salts ( ctss ) @xmath53-(et)@xmath51x ( anion : x = cu(ncs)@xmath51 , i@xmath54 , cu[n(cn)@xmath51]br , etc .",
    ") are quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) conductors consisting of layers of @xmath56-stacked bis-(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene ( bedt - ttf or et for short ) , separated by insulating anion layers .",
    "the separation between the conducting layers is sufficient to treat the et ctss as q2d systems . at low temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath53-(et)@xmath51x ctss become superconducting , with many properties similar to the high - temperature cuprate superconductors , e.g. : an anisotropic superconducting state  @xcite , with the possibility of a nodal energy gap  @xcite ; a phase diagram which consists of an antiferromagnetic insulating phase in close proximity to a superconducting phase ; and an unconventional metallic phase  @xcite .",
    "the fs of the x = cu(ncs)@xmath51 cts , as calculated using an extended tight binding model  @xcite , consists of a pair of corrugated q1d ( open ) electron sheets and a closed q2d hole pocket . when a magnetic field is applied in the plane of the q1d fs , charged particles move in response to the lorentz force along periodic momentum - space trajectories across the q1d fs sheets . during this motion ,",
    "the fermi velocity , @xmath57 , remains exactly perpendicular to the fs .",
    "consequently @xmath57 becomes _ oscillatory _ due to the periodic corrugation of the fs .",
    "this _ oscillatory _",
    "velocity results in a conductivity resonance@xmath40the so - called periodic - orbit - resonance ( por  @xcite ) .",
    "this q1d por can be distinguished from the usual cr by its angle dependence  @xcite , which is given by ,      where @xmath59 is the microwave frequency , @xmath60 is the projection of the magnetic field ( @xmath61 ) onto the plane of the fs , @xmath62 is the projection of the lattice vector associated with the fs corrugation onto the fs , and @xmath63 is the angle between the corrugating axis ( along @xmath64 ) and @xmath60 ; _ e _ is the electron charge , and _ h _ is the plank constant .",
    "one can , therefore , determine _",
    "@xmath57 _ and the direction of the corrugation axis , @xmath64 , by studying angle dependent q1d por .",
    "measurements for x = cu(ncs)@xmath51 were carried out using the 33 tesla resistive magnet at the nhmfl .",
    "the high fields are needed in order to access the metallic phase at low - temperatures ( @xmath65  k ) , since the superconducting critical field @xmath66 is @xmath67  t for fields perpendicular to the layers and @xmath68  t for fields parallel to the layers .",

    "the angle dependence of the por position [ fig .",
    "6(a ) ] , and the sdh oscillation frequency , are plotted in fig .",
    "the sdh oscillations are governed by the closed trajectories on the hole fs ; thus , their angle - dependence should be the same as that for a q2d cr  @xcite .",
    "however , the angle dependence of the observed por in fig .",
    "6 is clearly quite different from the sdh oscillations .",

    "perhaps the most striking difference in the spectra for the two complexes is the significant overlap of the @xmath50 and @xmath111 series of resonances for the mn@xmath89-ac sample .",

    "in contrast , the overlapping of the @xmath50 and @xmath111 resonances have provided the first indications that the molecular easy axes for the mn@xmath89-ac complex are tilted locally ( up to @xmath115  @xcite ) .",
    "such tilting can be understood within the context of the solvent disorder picture  @xcite : the various fine structures , and angular overlap of different portions of the epr spectra , reflect a ( discrete ) distribution of local environments caused by the solvent disorder .",
    "using the two axis rotation capabilities , more recent studies have confirmed the discrete nature of the local environments , e.g. the molecular easy axis tilts are confined to orthogonal planes , and each of the epr fine structures has its own distinct angle dependence  @xcite . meanwhile , none of the fine - structures are seen in the mn@xmath89-brac complex , thus confirming the idea that the acetic acid solvent significantly influences the magnetization dynamics in mn@xmath89-ac .",

    "<S> the cavity perturbation technique is an extremely powerful method for measuring the electrodynamic response of a material in the millimeter- and sub - millimeter spectral range ( 10  ghz to 1  thz ) , particularly in the case of high - field / frequency magnetic resonance spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the application of such techniques within the limited space of a high - field magnet presents significant technical challenges . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a @xmath0  mm  @xmath1  mm ( diameter  @xmath2  length ) rotating cylindrical cavity which overcomes these problems . </S>",
    "<S> the cylinder is mounted transverse to the bore of the magnet , coupling is achieved through the side walls of the cavity , and the end plate is then rotated ( by means of an external drive ) instead of the body of the cavity itself . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , rotation does not affect the cylindrical geometry , or the mechanical connections to the incoming waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> the te011 mode frequency of the loaded cavity is 51.863  ghz , with the possibility to work on higher - order modes to frequencies of order 350  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> neither the quality factor ( @xmath3 for the fundamental mode ) or the coupling to the cavity are significantly affected for full @xmath4 of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation mechanism provides excellent angle resolution ( @xmath5 ) , and is compact enough to enable measurements in the high - field ( up to 45  t ) magnets at the national high magnetic field laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> two - axis rotation capabilities are also possible in conjunction with split - pair magnet configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we present examples of angle - dependent measurements which illustrate the unique capabilities of this rotating cavity , including : high - field angle - dependent measurements of a novel form of cyclotron resonance in anisotropic organic conductors ; and angle - dependent high - frequency single - crystal electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements in single - molecule magnets . </S>"
