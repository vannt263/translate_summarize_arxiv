    "the transverse muon polarization , @xmath5 , in the decay @xmath6  ( @xmath7 ) provides a good opportunity to search for cp - violation beyond the standard model  ( sm ) , and it can provide insight into the origin of cp - violation .",
    "this polarization vanishes in the sm  @xcite , but it can be as large as @xmath8 in models with multi - higgs doublets , leptoquarks , left ",
    "right symmetry or susy  @xcite . since the contribution to @xmath5 from final state interactions was found to be @xmath9  @xcite , a larger value of @xmath1 would be a clear indication of physics beyond the sm by inferring a non - zero im@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ratio of two form factors , @xmath12 in the @xmath7 decay matrix element  @xcite .",
    "the previous result , @xmath13 and im@xmath14 was obtained in  @xcite for the 1996 - 97 data set . in this paper",
    "we present a new result of one of the analyses of the data collected in 1998 - 2000 combined with our previous published result .",
    "the e246 experiment was carried out at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron .",
    "detector elements are described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the @xmath7 decay of a stopped @xmath15 is identified by detecting the @xmath16 as well as the @xmath0 from the decay . the e246 setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "a 660-mev / c kaon beam is slowed down in a degrader and stopped in a scintillating fiber target .",
    "the energy and direction of the @xmath17 from the @xmath7 decay are measured by a segmented csi(tl ) photon detector installed in the central region of a superconducting toroidal magnet .",
    "a muon from the @xmath7 decay at rest is momentum  analyzed in magnet gaps by tracking in the stopping target , a scintillating ring hodoscope surrounding the target , and three mwpcs ( c2 , c3 , c4 ) .",
    "the muon exiting the spectrometer is stopped in a polarimeter in which the decay positron asymmetry @xmath18 is measured in order to obtain @xmath1 .",
    "the polarimeter consists of 12 azimuthally arranged al stoppers , aligned with the magnet gaps , with scintillator counter system located between the magnet gaps .",
    "a positron from the decay of @xmath19 is detected by plastic scintillator counters located between the stoppers .    in the new analysis ,",
    "the @xmath7 event selection is similar to  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 momentum region of 100190 mev/@xmath20 was used to remove the @xmath21 decays .",
    "most of the muons from pion decay in flight in @xmath21 are rejected by using the @xmath22 cut in tracking .",
    "neutral pions from the @xmath7 decay are identified either by @xmath23 coincidence in the csi and applying a cut on the pion invariant mass  ( @xmath24 events ) , or by one detected photon with large @xmath25  ( @xmath26 events ) .",
    "the @xmath27 events which also satisfy these requirements are removed by time - of - flight . in -",
    "flight kaon decays were suppressed by a requiring a delayed decay after a @xmath15 is stopped .",
    "the  good \" @xmath7 events were separated into two classes : @xmath28 events with the angle between @xmath29 and beam direction @xmath30 and @xmath31 events with @xmath32 .",
    "the signal was extracted by integrating the positron time spectrum from @xmath33 decays of muons stopped in the polarimeter after subtraction of the background .",
    "the t - violating asymmetry @xmath18 is obtained as a difference in the counting rate between clockwise ( @xmath34 ) and counter - clockwise ( @xmath35 ) emitted positrons .",
    "summing of the @xmath34 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath37 ) positron counts over all 12 sectors , @xmath18 is derived from @xmath38.\\ ] ] then , @xmath39 , where the analyzing power of the polarimeter is @xmath40 , obtained from asymmetry measurement of the in - plane component of @xmath0 polarization , @xmath41 , by selecting @xmath16s emitted transverse to the beam and comparing to a monte carlo calculation .",
    "the kinematic attenuation factor @xmath42 results from accepting @xmath28 and @xmath31 events with @xmath43 and was also obtained from a monte carlo calculation .",
    "it has different values for @xmath26 and @xmath24 events : @xmath44 for @xmath24 and @xmath45 for @xmath26 events , depending on the background level in the csi .",
    "then , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 for @xmath24 ( @xmath26 ) events is a kinematic factor obtained from the analysis of the @xmath7 dalitz distribution .",
    "the contamination of the beam accidental backgrounds in  good \" @xmath7 events was about 8%  ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath48%  ( @xmath26 ) , and the constant background in the polarimeter was @xmath49% .",
    "these backgrounds only diluted the sensitivity to @xmath1 by 10% , but they did not produce any spurious t - violating asymmetry .",
    "the main systematics uncertainties in @xmath1 come from the two large in - plane components of the @xmath0 polarization , @xmath50 which is parallel to the muon momentum and @xmath41 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the largest systematic errors are due to the misalignment of the polarimeter , the asymmetry of magnetic field distribution , and the asymmetrical kaon stopping distribution .",
    "most of these effects are canceled by the azimuthal symmetry of the detector as well as by the @xmath52 ratio .",
    "for example , the effect of the kaon stopping distribution is reduced by more than a factor of 10  @xcite .",
    "the total systematic error of @xmath1 is estimated to be the same as that of the previous result  @xcite .",
    "the data analysis was performed by two independent groups . both analyses obtained consistent results for 1996 - 97 data set ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the result for 1998 - 2000 data set was obtained by one of the analyses .",
    "in 19982000 we selected about @xmath53  good \" @xmath7 events . to check the stability of the result ,",
    "all data  taking periods , including 1996 - 97 , were divided roughly in 100-hour time intervals , and @xmath18 for @xmath26 and @xmath24 events in each interval were calculated .",
