    "mixtures whose constituent particles show a high asymmetry in sizes are quite common in soft matter physics . as a matter of fact , all soft - matter systems are at least two - component mixtures , as they are typically suspensions or dispersions of mesoscopically - sized colloidal particles in a microscopic solvent . for many practical purposes ,",
    "though , it suffices to model the solvent as a continuous medium and then an effective , one - component description of the suspended colloidal particles is sufficient .",
    "the phenomenology is much richer when more than one species of colloids is dispersed in the solvent and also there the asymmetry in the sizes of the two kinds of colloidal particles can be much higher than the one encountered in atomic or molecular fluids . in the recent past , a great deal of attention has been paid to the investigation of model colloid - polymer mixtures , in which the two species are hard colloidal spheres and soft , flexible polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the theoretical analysis of such systems is carried out within the framework of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite , in which the polymers are modeled as ideal , interpenetrating spheres that experience a hard repulsion towards the colloids .",
    "another popular system that has attracted a lot of attention recently are binary hard - sphere mixtures of various size ratios @xcite . in both of those cases",
    ", attention is usually focussed on the influence of the smaller component on the structural and phase behavior of the larger one @xcite .",
    "demixing phase transitions and their competition to the crystallization transition of the large hard spheres have been an issue of intensive investigations in the past @xcite with current research steering in the direction of the study of interfacial and wetting properties of such mixtures @xcite , as well as the influence of the additives on the vitrification transition of the hard spheres @xcite .",
    "a convenient concept that has helped shed light into the phenomenology of such asymmetric mixtures is that of the effective , _ depletion interaction _ between the hard spheres , which is mediated by the smaller component @xcite . in the case of the ao - mixture ,",
    "the depletion interaction is purely attractive and has the range of the size of the added polymer . for binary hard - sphere mixtures , the effective depletion potential displays oscillatory behavior due to correlation effects @xcite .",
    "interpolating between the two extremes of ideal and hard additives are star polymers of varying functionality , whose depleting effects on hard spheres have been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the notion of depletion is almost exclusively invoked whenever the large particles are hard colloids .",
    "nevertheless , it can be expanded in its interpretation to account for the modification of the properties of the large particles in the presence of smaller ones also for arbitrary kinds of interactions between the constituent particles .",
    "there is relatively little done in this direction , however , with the exception of the derivation of effective potentials in yukawa mixtures @xcite and in mixtures of star polymers and linear chains @xcite . in the last case",
    ", it has been shown that the depletion mechanism of the chains on the stars can account for the experimentally observed melting of the star - polymer gel upon addition of linear polymer . in this paper",
    ", we turn our attention to two - component mixtures in which all particle species interact by means of soft potentials and , in particular , to mixtures of two kinds of star polymers : large ones with a high number of arms and small ones will a low arm number .",
    "all species interact via logarithmic - yukawa pair potentials .",
    "we find that in this case the depletion mechanism of the small stars on the big ones has the effect of reducing the repulsive potential between the latter and thus it brings about a melting of the colloidal crystal formed by the large stars .",
    "concomitant to this effect is a partial loss of correlations between the centers of the big stars , manifested in a drastic lowering of the peak height of their partial structure factor .",
    "upon addition of a sufficiently large quantity of depleting agents , even an effective _ attraction _ between the large stars shows up , resulting in a demixing spinodal between the two species .",

    "solid coexistence region obtained by this approach is rather wide , due to the mapping on the effective hard - sphere system .",
    "accurate calculations of the phase diagram of star polymers reveal that the coexistence region is much more narrow @xcite , yet the shape and evolution of the freezing lines as a function of @xmath98 are not influenced by the width of the density gap between the fluid and the solid phases .",

    "the sharp kinks that show up in figs .",
    "[ figphases](a ) and [ figphases](b ) are artifacts of the way in which the effective hard sphere diameter @xmath130 was determined and , in particular , of the fact that the attractive perturbation part @xmath153 of the effective potential is absent in the treatment for small reservoir densities below the kink and present above it .",
    "in reality , we expect the phase coexistence lines to ` turn around ' smoothly , i.e. , without the aforementioned artificial kink .",
    "however , the topology of the phase diagram and in particular the positive slope of the freezing lines and the subsequent broadening of the coexistence region into a ` gas - crystal ' phase separation is not expected to be affected by these approximations . for larger values of @xmath23 ,",
    "a strong attraction does not emerge , so there is no fluid - fluid demixing . from fig .",
    "[ figphases ] it can be seen that less stars with @xmath57 than with @xmath123 are needed to achieve similar effect .",

    "colloid mixtures @xcite , where stable binodals were only found for small depletant functionalities such as @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for the star - polymer mixtures we consider here , the existence of a binodal is less likely than in star - polymer ",
    "colloid mixtures , because for star polymers the depletion force has to overcome the yukawa - type repulsion between them before an effective attraction sets in .",
    "a striking effect is the melting of the crystal of the big stars upon addition of the small component , as can be seen from the positive slope of the freezing- and melting lines in fig .",
    "[ figphases ] .",
    "no effective attraction between the star - polymers is needed for this effect . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.diameter ] , the effective hard sphere diameter @xmath130 of the system decreases with increasing depletant density .",
    "therefore , the effective packing fraction @xmath156 for the big stars gets smaller with increasing @xmath98 . since this quantity determines the location of the freezing transition , the latter shifts to higher values of @xmath68 .",
    "the melting is therefore caused by the apparent shrinkage of the stars due to the depletion effects .",
    "the counterintuitive behavior of melting of a crystal although the overall polymer concentration is increased has its physical roots in the _ soft depletion _ mechanism and the associated reduction of the range of the repulsive potential between the big stars .    in real experimental systems of star polymers ,",
    "usually the formation of a glass is observed instead of crystallization .",
    "these glass transition lines are usually parallel to the freezing lines of the phase diagram , a property explicitly confirmed for the glass line of one - component star polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the kinetic phase diagram of the mixture will have a topology running parallel to that of the equilibrium one that we traced in this study .",
    "we predict , therefore , that addition of small stars will bring about a melting of the colloidal glass ( or gel ) formed by the large ones .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for mixtures of star polymers with linear homopolymer chains @xcite .",
    "by calculating the partial chemical potentials of the two - component system , we now map the reservoir representation @xmath157 on the real physical system @xmath158 , so as to make contact with experimental work , in which @xmath98 has no direct relevance .",
    "the densities @xmath69 and @xmath55 are linked by the condition that the chemical potential of the reservoir @xmath71 has to be the same as the partial chemical potential in the system @xmath70 .",
    "the chemical potential in the reservoir of density @xmath98 can easily be calculated if the fluid structure is known .",
    "the helmholtz free energy density of the small stars in the reservoir , @xmath159 , can be split into an ideal and an excess part : @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 is an arbitrary length scale .",

    "we now consider the spatial correlations between the big stars in the fluid phase .",
    "we compare the correlation functions calculated in the two - component description with those arising from the one - component description using the effective interactions in the presence of the smaller species .",
    "the comparison has to be carried out for parameter combinations such that the reservoir- and system partial chemical potentials of the smaller species are equal to one another .",
    "as the one - component description reduces the effective interaction to pair potentials , the comparison of the structural properties allows to estimate the magnitude of many body effects on the depletion .    in fig .",
    "[ figcompare ] we show the radial distribution functions and static structure factors of the big stars calculated with both different approaches . for the one - component case , the ry closure can be used because for the densities we consider here the effective interactions remain purely repulsive .",

    "the two component description includes many - body forces between the big stars which are caused by the smaller component .",
    "these effects are neglected in the effective one - component description @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figcompare ] , one can see excellent agreement of the results obtained by using these two different descriptions of the physical system .",
    "this additionally corroborates the validity of our approximation of the effective interaction .",
    "it can be also be concluded from the plots that the three - body forces are indeed much weaker than the pair interactions and can be safely neglected @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the structural and phase behavior of highly asymmetric mixtures of star polymers , with the asymmetry characterizing both their sizes and functionalities .",
    "the most striking phenomenon predicted by our investigations is the counter - intuitive _ melting _ of the colloidal crystal of the big stars upon addition of small ones .",
    "though this finding appears paradoxical at first sight , since addition of smaller stars increases the overall polymer concentration of the solution , its physical explanation can be traced to the effects of _ soft depletion_. whereas the depletants of hard spheres simply superimpose an effective attraction on a hard potential , when the big particles are themselves repulsive the depletion attraction is superimposed on a ( soft ) repulsion . in this way , a repulsive potential of reduced strength and/or range results and the effective , reduced repulsion is not any more sufficient to maintain the stability of the crystal , which therefore melts .",
    "when the depletant concentration becomes sufficiently high , the attractive depletion force dominates over the soft repulsion , leading to a ( possibly metastable ) demixing transition between the two species .    in real experimental systems of star polymers with high functionality ,",
    "crystallization is hindered by the vitrification ( gelation ) transition and the large stars become structurally arrested in a glassy state above the overlap concentration .",
    "the next step would be then to investigate the role and influence of smaller star additives on the glass transition of larger stars , a problem of significant importance for the control of the rheological behavior of soft matter through additives .",
