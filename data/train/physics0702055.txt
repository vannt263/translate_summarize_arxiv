    "among singular features of granular media , force transmission has received particular interest during the last decade . the contact forces in model granular media , as observed by experiments and numerical simulations , are highly inhomogeneous and their probability density functions ( pdf s ) are wide @xcite .",
    "the granular texture is generically anisotropic in two respects : 1 ) the contact normal directions are not random ; 2 ) the force average as a function of contact normal direction is not uniform .",
    "the corresponding fabric and force anisotropies in shear are responsible for mechanical strength at the scale of the packing @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect , first analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the fact that the forces organize themselves in two distinct classes which contribute differently to fabric anisotropy , shear stress , and dissipation . in particular ,",
    "the shear stress is fully transmitted via a `` strong '' contact network , materialized by force  chains \" .",
    "the stability is ensured by the antagonist role of `` weak '' contacts which prop strong force chains@xcite .",
    "the force transmission properties have been for the most part investigated in the case of granular media composed of isometric ( circular or spheric ) particles .",
    "however , in various fields of science and engineering , the grains are seldom so `` perfect '' .",
    "for example , elongated and platy shapes are encountered in biomaterials or pharmaceutical applications .",
    "such shapes have unequal dimensions and induce thus a degree of anisotropy in the bulk behavior in addition to fabric and force anisotropies @xcite . on the other hand , granular geomaterials are often composed of angular particles with plane faces as polyhedra .",
    "while rounded particles enhance flowability , angular shape is susceptible to enhance the shear strength , a factor of vital importance to civil - engineering applications @xcite .",
    "the railway ballast is a well - known case where particle shape must be optimized to avoid excessive differential settlement under vertical loading @xcite . in such circumstances ,",
    "the analysis of force transmission is a key to improve performance .    in dealing with effects of particle shape ,",
    "the issue is that a general quantitative description of particle morphology requires various shape parameters . for regular polygons in 2d , for instance",
    ", the only shape parameter is the number of sides ( besides the diameter ) whereas for irregular polygons more information is needed about the positions of the vertices in a reference system attached to the particle . in soil mechanics , angularity and roundedness are among basic parameters used to describe particle shapes @xcite . as far as force transmission",
    "is concerned , at least two parameters seem to be most relevant : 1 ) shape anisotropy ( anisometry ) , which contributes to the anisotropy of stress transmission @xcite ; 2 ) _ facettedness _ , which allows for extended ( face to face , edge to face and edge to edge ) contacts between particles leading possibly to the formation of columnar structures within a granular assembly .    in this paper , we consider one of the simplest possible shapes , namely regular pentagons . among regular polygons ,",
    "the pentagon has the lowest number of sides , corresponding to the least roundedness in this category , without the pathological space - filling properties of triangles and squares .",
    "we seek to isolate the effect of edge - to - edge contacts on force transmission by comparing the data with a packing of circular particles that , apart from the particle shape , is identical in all respects ( preparation , friction coefficients , particle size distribution ) to the pentagon packing .",
    "both packings are subjected to biaxial compression simulated by means of the contact dynamics method .",
    "the presence of edge - to - edge contacts affects both quantitatively and qualitatively the microstructure and the overall behavior during shear .",
    "these contacts do not transmit torques , but they are able to accommodate force lines that are usually unsustainable in packings of disks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present in section [ procedure ] the numerical procedures and a brief technical introduction to the detection and treatment of edge - to - edge contacts in the framework of the contact dynamics method . in section [ strength ] , we compare stress - strain and volume - change characteristics .",
    "then , in sections [ texture ] and [ force ] , we analyze the texture and force transmission features . in section [ sd ] ,",
    "we focus on the pentagon packing and we analyze the structure of force networks with vertex - to - edge and edge - to - edge contacts .",
    "the main results are summarized and discussed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the simulations were carried out by means of the contact dynamics ( cd ) method @xcite .",
    "the cd method is based on implicit time integration of the equations of motion and a nonsmooth formulation of mutual exclusion and dry friction between particles .",
    "this method requires no elastic repulsive potential and no smoothing of the coulomb friction law for the determination of forces . for this reason",
    ", the simulations can be performed with large time steps compared to molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we used the platform lmgc90 which is a multipurpose software developed in montpellier , capable of modeling a collection of deformable or undeformable particles of various shapes @xcite .",
    "the particles are rigid polygons exerting normal and shear forces , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , on each other .",
    "we attribute a positive sign to compressive normal forces .",
    "the relative normal velocity @xmath2 between two particles in contact is counted positive when they move away from each other .",
    "then , the condition of geometrical contact between two particles is expressed by the following mutually exclusive alternatives : @xmath3    in the same way , the coulomb friction law involves three mutually exclusive conditions : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sliding velocity at the contact and @xmath6 is the friction coefficient .",
    "the unknown variables are particle velocities and contact forces .",
    "these are calculated at each time step by taking into account the conservation of momenta , the constraints expressed by ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , and the dissipation of kinetic energy during inelastic collisions between particles ( ref ) .",
    "we use an iterative research algorithm based on a nonlinear gauss - seidel scheme .",
    "the uniqueness is not guaranteed for perfectly rigid particles in absolute terms . however , by initializing each step of calculation with the forces calculated in the preceding step , the set of admissible solutions shrinks to fluctuations which are basically below the numerical solution .",
    "let us note that in molecular dynamics simulations , this  force history \" is encoded by construction in the particle positions .",
    "the research algorithm is applied to a set of potential contacts , identified or updated in each step .",
    "the contact detection between two bodies consists in looking for the overlaps of the portions of space they occupy .",
    "the treatment of the mechanical interaction requires additionally the identification of a common tangent plane ( a line in 2d ) .",
    "of course , contact may take place through a larger contact zone than a single point .",
    "several algorithms exist for overlap determination between convex polygons @xcite . in 2d simulations of the present paper ,",
    "the detection of contact between two convex polygonal bodies was implemented through the so - called `` shadow overlap method '' devised by moreau @xcite , with reliability and robustness tested in several years of previous applications to various states of granular materials @xcite .    in detection of contacts between two polygons ,",
    "two situations arise : 1 ) if a single corner is found crossing an edge of the partner polygon , the direction of this edge is viewed as the tangent direction . by",
    "orthogonally projecting the intruding vertex onto the edge , one determines the penetration depth , while the nominal contact point is chosen at the center of this distance .",
    "below , we will refer to this vertex - to - edge contact as  simple \" contact .",
    "2 ) in case of double intrusion , the common tangent line is fixed from as a mean between the two overlapping edges and a segment of this line is identified as the contact segment . the impenetrability between two particles at such an edge - to - edge contact",
    "is ensured by applying the contact laws ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) to only two points of the contact segment ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we refer below to edge - to - edge contacts as  double \" contacts . in practice ,",
    "two forces are calculated at each double contact , but only their resultant and application point are material . in this respect , the choice of the two points representing a double contact does not affect the dynamics of the system .",
    ", width=302 ]      we generated two numerical samples .",
    "the first sample , denoted s1 , is composed of 14400 regular pentagons of three different diameters : @xmath7 of diameter @xmath8 cm , @xmath9 of diameter @xmath10 cm and @xmath11 of diameter @xmath12 cm .",
    "the second sample , denoted s2 , is composed of 10000 discs with the same polydispersity .",
    "both samples were prepared according to the same protocol .",
    "a dense packing was first constructed following simple geometrical rules @xcite and then compressed isotropically under a constant stress @xmath13 pa applied onto the right and top walls .",

    "the simulations were run up to a total cumulative vertical strain of @xmath21 with a time step of @xmath22 s. the cpu time was @xmath23 s and @xmath22 s per particle and per time step on a g5 apple computer .",
    "since we are interested in quasistatic behavior , the shear rate should be such that the kinetic energy supplied by shearing is negligible compared to the static pressure .",
    "this can be formulated in terms of an `` inertia parameter '' @xmath24 @xcite defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strain rate , @xmath27 is the total mass , and @xmath28 is the average pressure .",
