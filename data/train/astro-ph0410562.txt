    "our understanding of quiet sun magnetic fields is evolving at a very rapid pace .",
    "the classical picture of the quiet sun is based on a sprinkling of kilo - gauss ( kg ) fluxtube - like structures of sub - arcsecond sizes ( unresolved in the observations ) forming a magnetic network at the boundaries of the supergranular cells .",
    "the internetwork ( cell interiors ) would be almost devoid of flux , exhibiting only sparse weak turbulent flux concentrations .",
    "as new observations became available with improved sensitivity and spatial resolution , the internetwork region started to gain importance .",
    "strong kg fields were also found in many internetwork locations and the amount of magnetic flux and energy detected has increased as the instrumentation improved ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .    at the same time , the concept of organized magnetic structures ( e.g. , fluxtubes ) as the building blocks for quiet sun fields seems to be losing some ground , at least outside of the network .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) reveal a more disorganized , almost chaotic , scenario with the field being dragged around by turbulent convective motions .",
    "another important element in this picture is the discrepancy in the distribution of internetwork fields as seen in visible and infrared observations .",
    "infrared data ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) show a predominance of sub - kg fields , with a distribution that peaks around 350  g. on the other hand , authors working with visible observations ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) obtain that most of these fields are of kg strength . @xcite ( @xcite ) proposed that this discrepancy is a natural consequence of unresolved small - scale inhomogeneities of the field .",
    "if one has a mixture of weak and strong fields coexisting in the resolution element , visible and infrared observations tend to emphasize different parts of the distribution .    in a recent paper , @xcite ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite @xcite ) showed that the visible lines at 6302  exhibit some sensitivity to unresolved field strength inhomogeneities . in the present work",
    "we make use of this property to seek evidence that mixed strengths indeed occur in the quiet sun . as we discuss below , we are able to detect a rather large number of such mixed strengths .",
    "our results support the `` disorganized '' picture of the quiet sun fields discussed above , not only in the internetwork but also to some extent in the magnetic network .",
    "the datasets analyzed in this paper come from two different instruments .",
    "the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ) is a spectro - polarimeter for the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) at the sacramento peak observatory ( sunspot , nm , usa ) , operated by the national solar observatory .",
    "we used the map observed by @xcite ( @xcite ) on sep 29 , 1994 ( hereafter referred to as map  1 ) .",
    "this map has a spatial resolution of @xmath01 and a spectral resolution of @xmath030  m .",
    "the spectral lines observed are the pair of lines in the 6302  region .",
    "the other instrument employed is the diffraction - limited stokes polarimeter ( dlsp ) , which is operated at the same telescope .",
    "the dlsp is a new instrument that has been designed specifically to take advantage of the new adaptive optics ( ao ) system at the dst in order to achieve very high angular resolution .",
    "it has been optimized for the routine observation of the 6302  spectral region .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) obtained what can be considered very high - resolution stokes observations of the quiet sun , of approximately 0.6 .",
    "this figure , alongside with the 0.5 reached by @xcite ( @xcite ) , represent the highest resolution spectro - polarimetric observations of quiet sun fields made thus far . in our analysis here",
    "we consider the best two maps observed by @xcite ( @xcite ) , namely the ones observed on sep 14 and sep 16 2003 ( hereafter map  2 and map  3 , respectively ) .",
    "we first conducted a one - component ( hereafter 1c ) analysis , assuming that we have one field strength ( @xmath2 ) that occupies a certain area filling factor ( @xmath3 ) of the spatial pixel . instead of performing an iterative least - squares fit to the observations , we chose to do forward modeling from a large number of models . in this manner",
    "we make sure that the entire model space is probed and that the absolute minimum of the @xmath4 merit function is found .",
    "we start with two models for the thermodynamic parameters ( temperature , gas pressure , micro- and macroturbulence and line - of - sight velocity ) of the quiet sun , representing a granule and an intergranular lane .",
    "the models were obtained from the inversion of average stokes  i profiles .",
    "the stokes  v profiles were then synthesized for many values of the magnetic field strength ( ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6  g ) and a global velocity offset ( from @xmath7 to @xmath8 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the calculations were performed with the code lilia ( @xcite @xcite ) , assuming lte and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "depending on the continuum intensity of the observations , we used the granule or lane models or a suitable linear combination of both . in the case of the quiet sun",
    "this is approach is valid because the thermodynamical properties of the atmosphere experience only relatively small variations across the map .",
    "fig  [ intfits ] shows the fits obtained with this method to intensity profiles from four randomly - chosen locations .",
    "reasonably good fits are obtained for the entire dataset analyzed , which justifies the approximation used for the thermodynamics of the atmosphere .",
    "the synthetic stokes  v profiles ( @xmath10 ) were multiplied by a filling factor @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 denotes the amplitude of a given profile ) and then compared one by one to the observed profile ( @xmath13 ) at each spatial position of the maps .",
    "the sign of the synthetic profile is chosen to match the polarity of @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 that yield the best fit to @xmath13 are taken as representative of the conditions at the spatial location under consideration .",
    "this process is repeated for every pixel in every map .",
    "the spatial distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 thus obtained are shown if figs  [ fig : map1 ] and  [ fig : map23 ] ( upper panels ) .",
    "it is important to note that the 6302  lines are in the weak field regime ( i.e. , the regime in which the zeeman splitting is much smaller than the doppler width ) for field strengths lower than @xmath0500  g. in the weak field regime the shape of the stokes  v profiles is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "the profiles are simply scaled with the value of the field .",
    "thus , it is not possible to disentangle the effects of the filling factor from the field strength . in other words",
    ", any value of the field weaker than 500  g will result in exactly the same @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the reader must keep in mind that any fields below 500  g depicted in the figures might be actually weaker ( with correspondingly larger filling factors ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) suggested that the lines at 6302  exhibit some sensitivity to the presence of two magnetic strength components .",
    "when the two field strengths are at least as far apart as 500  g and 1700  g , their response functions are sufficiently decoupled that the _ relative _ filling factors of these two components can be inferred with an uncertainty of 0.10 or less . as a further step in our study , we carried out a two - component ( 2c ) analysis of the observations .",
    "considering the arbitrariness in the strength of the weak component we chose a value of 300  g , which is close to the peak of the distribution obtained from 1c inversions of infrared internetwork observations ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we ( arbitrarily ) fixed the strengths of the weak and strong components to 300  g and 1700  g , respectively .",
    "the problem now is to find the filling factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "let us define these filling factors relative to the magnetic element , so that @xmath17 .",
    "the total magnetic filling factor in the observed pixel is still @xmath3 .",
    "the filling factors of the two components relative to the resolution element are then @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this convention may seem somewhat confusing at first , but it is useful for the discussion in  [ sec : results ] below .",
    "the synthetic profiles @xmath10 for the 2c case were calculated in the following manner .",
    "as before , we start with the a model for the atmospheric thermodynamics which depends on the observed continuum intensity . we then synthesized the profiles @xmath20 and @xmath21 for 300 and 1700  g , respectively . at each spatial location",
    "we compared the profiles @xmath13 and @xmath22 ( where , again , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 that lead to the best fit of the observations are selected .",
    "notice that only two of these parameters , @xmath14 and either @xmath16 or @xmath15 , are independent .    in order to ensure that the detection of mixed field strengths has significance",
    ", we rewarded solutions with either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath4 corresponding to these solutions is reduced by 10% .",
    "this conservative approach makes the procedure `` prefer '' one - component solutions .",
    "it is also important to point out that , while we are not adding any degrees of freedom when going from 1c ( above ) to 2c , the @xmath4 is smaller in the 2c analysis virtually everywhere .",
    "these arguments ( alongside with those in ",
    "[ sec : reliability ] ) give us confidence in the results reported below .",
    "figs  [ fig : map1 ] and  [ fig : map23 ] show the spatial distribution of @xmath3 ( upper left ) , @xmath2 ( upper right ) , @xmath16 ( lower left ) and @xmath15 ( lower right ) .",
    "the 1c analysis results in strong kg fields in most spatial pixels inverted ( i.e. , those exhibiting significant polarization signal ) , with the exceptions of very few weak field patches in the network and some weak field elements in the internetwork .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations published in the literature based on visible lines , in which the distribution of fields peaks around 1.5  kg ( see references in  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the lower panels of the figures clearly show the presence of mixed - strength pixels both in network and internetwork locations .",
    "let us start by discussing the results for the internetwork . in this region , visible and infrared observations",
    "( always using 1c analyses ) have led to disparate conclusions , with the infrared lines showing a much larger fraction of weaker fields . according to @xcite ( @xcite ) , this can be explained by a small - scale mixture of weak and strong fields beyond the spatial resolution .",
    "they showed that , when such mixture exists , a 1c inversion of the visible lines is biased towards the stronger fields . therefore , we would expect to have mixed field strengths in those spatial pixels where the 1c analysis results in strong fields .",
    "those with weak fields , on the other hand , are probably rather homogeneous .",
    "this is exactly what we find in the analysis of our internetwork profiles , as seen in figs  [ fig : map1 ] and  [ fig : map23 ] , as well as in table  [ table : maps ] .",
    "we did not find any mixed strengths in pixels with @xmath25 and @xmath26  g.    let us now turn to the network .",
    "the relatively strong flux concentrations in network patches have been traditionally associated with strong kg fields ( see references in  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "while our 1c analysis agrees with this assessment , the 2c analysis reveals the presence of a significant amount of weak fields mixed at small scales .",
    "the mixed strengths occur all over the network patches and not only around their perimeter .",
    "table  [ table : maps ] lists some properties of the network elements , including the percentage of pixels showing mixed strengths .",
    "finally , we find ( not shown in the table ) that the fractional area occupied by weak fields is larger in the convective upflows than in the downflows ( as one would expect ) .",
    "lccc mean 1c flux ( mx  @xmath27 ) & 8.7 & 5.2 & 6.2 + mean 2c flux ( mx  @xmath27 ) & 9.2 & 5.4 & 6.1 + mean 1c field ( g ) & 1529 & 999 & 1064 + mean 2c field ( g ) & 1192 & 928 & 924 + pixels analyzed & 25.9% & 24.5% & 24.0% + pixels harboring & & & + mixed strengths & 14.8% & 7.6% & 2.8% + mixed strength in pixels & & & + with @xmath25 , @xmath26  g & 0% & 0% & 0% + mean flux in & & & + strong fields ( mx  @xmath27 ) & 6.3 & 3.3 & 2.6 + mean flux in & & & + weak fields ( mx  @xmath27 ) & 2.9 & 2.1 & 3.5 + fraction of upflowing & & & + area with strong fields & 12.9% & 1.6% & 9.5% + fraction of downflowing & & & + area with strong fields & 28.2% & 24.4% & 13.2% +",
    "we have not been concerned thus far with problems such as line asymmetries or details of the sub - pixel field distribution",
    ". this would be a concern if we were interested in obtaining a detailed description of the solar atmosphere , including velocity and magnetic field gradients .",
    "our goal , however , is not that , but rather to demonstrate that weak and strong fields generally coexist at sub - arcsecond spatial scales .",
    "how is this overall conclusion affected by the simplifying assumptions employed in our work ?",
    "this important question is explored in the present section by means of numerical simulations . before going into the details , though , it is probably a good idea to consider the broader context of the subject in order to put our work into perspective",
    ".    in doing analysis of solar magnetic fields based on spectro - polarimetric observations there are various levels of complexity that one can consider , depending on the sophistication of the physical models employed .",
    "the most simplistic analyses are the `` traditional '' techniques , such as the line ratio , the separation of stokes  v extrema , or fits by gaussian profiles .",
    "these techniques do not involve radiative transfer calculations and do not require a detailed knowledge of the atmospheric model .",
    "they typically provide only a rough approximation to the magnetic field , but are unable to deal with line asymmetries due to unresolved inhomogeneities , atmospheric gradients , etc .",
    "the most sophisticated techniques make use of full radiative transfer calculations in detailed model atmospheres to fit the observed profiles in a least - squares sense ( inversion codes ) .",
    "most of the published work ( see references in  [ sec : intro ] ) makes use of the simplistic techniques to infer `` typical '' values of the photospheric field in the quiet sun .",
    "these simplified analyses led to the inference that network fields are typically strong ( @xmath01.5  kg ) , or that internetwork fields appear to be mostly kg when observed in the visible and sub - kg ( @xmath0300  g ) when observed in the infrared .",
    "very few authors ( e.g. , the works of @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) have used inversions that consider detailed models with atmospheric gradients . the overall picture ( i.e. , whether the fields are weak or strong ) does not change signifincantly , although the inversion codes obviously provide more information .",
    "detailed inversions have not been carried out in the infrared so far .",
    "the analyses published in the literature are derived from fits of gaussian functions to the observed profiles .",
    "our analysis in this paper lies somewhere between the two ends of the range of sophistication .",
    "we calculate actual stokes profiles from a model atmosphere , but do not consider line - of - sight variations of the quantities .",
    "the thermodynamics of our models is probably reasonably good , as suggested by the fits shown in fig  [ intfits ] .",
    "however , there are two important simplifications .",
    "first , we do not consider line - of - sight gradients of the field .",
    "second , we parameterize the unresolved field distribution by two discrete field values of 300  g and 1700  g. it is important to note that none of these assumptions are worse than those of the traditional methods ( save for the exceptions noted above ) which are based on single - valued fields without height variations .",
    "we have carried out some numerical simulations in order to gain insights into the adequateness of our approximations .",
    "first consider how our two - point approach is representative of the sub - pixel field distribution .",
    "suppose that we have an unresolved probability distribution function ( pdf ) of field strengths @xmath28 .",
    "the filling factor of fields with a strength between @xmath2 and @xmath29 is :    @xmath30    the emerging profile @xmath31 from such distribution is :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes the profile produced by a field of strength @xmath2 . for the moment we are only interested in horizontal inhomogeneities .",
    "the effects of gradients of @xmath2 along the line of sight will be discussed later .",
    "if we consider @xmath31 as a simulated observation and apply to it the procedure introduced in  [ sec:2c ] above , we can compare the inferred values with the actual pdf , @xmath28 , employed .",
    "table  [ table : pdf ] shows the results of various tests with different shapes of the pdf .",
    "as proposed by @xcite ( @xcite ) , and by @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ( @xcite ) , and @xcite ( @xcite ) , we adopted an exponential dependence for @xmath28 with a normalization factor @xmath34 .",
    "the filling factor of fields stronger than 2  kg has been set to zero .",
    "we also considered a dirac - delta pdf ( @xmath35 ) , which simply means that the field is homogeneous over the resolution element , with a strength @xmath36 .",
