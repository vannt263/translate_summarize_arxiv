    "after the discovery that perfect hydrodynamics can be valid for describing the phenomenology of relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite , people are now interested in relativistic hydrodynamics for _ dissipative _ systems ; see the recent excellent review articles @xcite .    recently , tsumura , kunihiro ( the present authors ) and ohnishi ( abbreviated as tko ) @xcite derived generic covariant hydrodynamic equations for a viscous fluid from the relativistic boltzmann equation in a systematic manner with no heuristic arguments on the basis of the so - called renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite .",
    "although the hydrodynamic equations they derived are the so - called first - order ones , the equations have remarkable aspects : the generic equation derived by tko can produce a relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equation in any frame with an appropriate choice of a macroscopic flow vector @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , which defines the coarse - grained space and time ; the resulting equation in the energy frame coincides with that of landau and lifshitz @xcite , while that in the particle frame is similar to , but slightly different from , the eckart equation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the dissipative term of the symmetric energy - momentum tensor and the particle - number vector , respectively . owing to the ambiguity in the separation of the energy and the mass inherent in relativistic theories , one must choose the local rest frame ( lrf ) where the flow velocity @xmath6 with @xmath7 is defined : one of the typical frame is the energy ( landau ) frame in which @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. there is no dissipative energy flow .",
    "on the other hand , another typical frame is the particle ( eckart ) frame in which @xmath11 , i.e. there is no dissipative particle flow .",
    "both in the energy and particle frames , the dissipative terms of the energy - momentum tensor and the particle - number vector are usually assumed to satisfy the constraints , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these phenomenological ansatz have been employed as the matching conditions even in the subsequent `` derivations '' of the so - called second - order equations @xcite ; note that even in the grad s moment method @xcite , some ansatz are needed to @xmath4 and @xmath14 as the matching conditions , for which different proposals exist @xcite .    here",
    "we emphasize that the matching conditions touch on the fundamental but not yet fully understood problem how to define the lrf in the relativistic fluid dynamics for a viscous system .",
    "the way how to define the lrf or equivalently to fix the matching condition is unsolved yet , and remains a nontrivial and fundamental problem in the field of nonequilibrium relativistic dynamics , although there have been no serious consideration on this difficult problem in the literature .",
    "actually , we shall argue that these phenomenological ansatz , especially eq.([eq : pt - e ] ) , can be false and actually is not compatible with the underlying kinetic equation .",
    "in fact , it is found that the tko equation in the particle frame derived from the relativistic boltzmann equation satisfies @xmath15 but does not satisfy eq.([eq : pt - e ] ) .",
    "one should here note that the derived condition ( [ eq : pt - tko ] ) is identical to a matching condition postulated by marle @xcite and advocated by stewart @xcite in the derivation of the relativistic hydrodynamics from the relativistic boltzmann equation with use of the grad s moment method .",
    "in their paper @xcite , tko proved that the eckart constraint ( [ eq : pt - e ] ) in the particle frame can not be compatible with the underlying relativistic boltzmann equation for the first - order hydrodynamic equation . in spite of the first - order one ,",
    "the tko equation in the particle frame is free from the pathological properties @xcite in contrast to the original eckart equation with which the thermal equilibrium becomes unstable for a small perturbation @xcite .",
    "one may naturally ask if the eckart constraint ( [ eq : pt - e ] ) should be replaced with ( [ eq : pt - tko ] ) even for the so - called second - order equation like israel - stewart one . and are any modifications needed to the constraints in the landau frame ?",
    "a purpose of this letter @xcite is to answer these questions both by phenomenological and microscopic analyses .",
    "we shall see that the eckart constraint should be replaced with the new one even in the second - order equation , while no modification is necessary for the constraints in the energy frame .",
    "we shall derive the second - order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamic equations in a generic frame with a continuous parameter @xmath16 from the relativistic boltzmann equation .",
    "we shall derive the relaxation terms for a generic frame with the new constraint , and present explicitly those in the energy and particle frames .",
    "we shall show that the viscosities are frame - independent but the relaxation times are generically frame - dependent in accordance with the observation by betz et al .",
    "@xcite , although the constraint to @xmath4 is quite different .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the symmetric energy - momentum tensor and the particle - number vector of the system we consider , respectively .",
    "the total number of independent variables is fourteen , and the dynamical evolution of these variables are governed by the respective balance equations ; @xmath19    with use of an arbitrary four vector @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be cast into the tensor - decomposed forms , @xmath20 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the internal energy , pressure , and particle - number density in the dissipative system ; @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 being the corresponding quantities in the local equilibrium state characterized by the temperature @xmath30 and the chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "note that we have made it explicit by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 that the dissipations may cause corrections to all these quantities , although only the correction to the pressure has been considered in the literature ; @xmath33 is identified with the bulk pressure @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize that there is no persuading reasoning that only the pressure acquires corrections due to the dissipative process .",
    "the dissipative parts of the energy - momentum tensor and particle - number vector are identified as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . the energy flow relative to @xmath6",
    "is denoted by @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the flow of particle number relative to @xmath6 , and finally @xmath40 is the shear stress tensor ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . here",
    "the space - like , symmetric and traceless tensor @xmath44 is introduced .",
    "one can easily confirm that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that the total number of independent components of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is eleven .",
    "since @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the fourteen components in total , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 have only one independent component other than @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we take @xmath49 as the independent component as a natural choice , then @xmath32 and @xmath34 can be expressed as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are functions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here",
    "we have assumed that the dissipative order of @xmath32 and @xmath34 are the same as that of @xmath33 at most .",
    "we remark that although @xmath52 and @xmath53 may take finite values generically , the functional forms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 can not be determined by the phenomenological theory , as those of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 can not , either .",
    "all the previous analyses assumed @xmath59 , which has not been recognized so far .",
    "now we shall show that the just usual phenomenological derivation of the hydrodynamic equations in which the second law of thermodynamics is utilized allows the existence of @xmath32 and @xmath34 , i.e. , finite values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it is found that the essential point of the proof is the same for the first- and second - order equations where the entropy current @xmath60 is at most linear and bilinear with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively , although the resulting mathematical expressions are much more complicated in the second - order one @xcite .",
    "thus we here take the first - order equation , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the second - order equations with finite @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be derived microscopically later in this article .",
    "so the entropy current is given by @xmath61 the second law of thermodynamics reads @xmath62 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath60 is found to take the form @xmath63      + q^\\mu \\ , \\bigg [ \\frac{1}{t } \\ ,",
    "du_\\mu + \\nabla_\\mu        \\frac{1}{t } \\bigg ] - \\nu^\\mu \\ ,      \\nabla_\\mu \\frac{\\mu}{t }      + \\pi^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\frac{1}{t } \\ , \\nabla_\\mu u_\\nu ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . here ,",
    "we have used the conservation laws , eq.s ( [ eq:2 - 001 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 - 002 ] ) , and the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath66 .",
    "the frames define the flow velocity @xmath67 of the fluid : the flow velocity in the particle frame and the energy frame are defined by setting @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively @xcite . by these settings , a closed system of the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equations is obtained .",
    "note that @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is equivalent to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .    in the particle frame where @xmath70 , eq.([eq:2 - 016 ] ) is reduced to @xmath72    + q^\\mu \\ , \\bigg [ \\frac{1}{t } \\ , du_\\mu + \\nabla_\\mu \\frac{1}{t } \\bigg ]    + \\pi^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\frac{1}{t } \\ , \\nabla_\\mu u_\\nu .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is found that the following constitutive equations , @xmath73,\\\\      \\label{eq:2 - 022 }      q^\\mu & = & - \\lambda \\ , t^2 \\ , \\bigg [ \\frac{1}{t } \\ , du^\\mu +        \\nabla^\\mu \\frac{1}{t } \\bigg],\\\\      \\label{eq:2 - 023 }      \\pi^{\\mu\\nu } & = & 2 \\ , \\eta \\ , \\delta^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma } \\ ,      \\nabla_\\rho u_\\sigma ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] guarantees the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath62 , with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 being the bulk viscosity , heat conductivity , and shear viscosity , respectively .",
    "this is because the divergence @xmath77 now becomes positive semi - definite ; @xmath78 thus we realize that there is nothing wrong with the resultant relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equations with finite @xmath52 and @xmath53 , or equivalently finite @xmath32 and @xmath34 , which is compatible with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "eq.s ( [ eq:2 - 021])-([eq:2 - 023 ] ) with a restricted condition @xmath59 are identical to the constitutive equations proposed by eckart that are commonly used .    in the energy frame",
    "where @xmath71 , we can obtain the constitutive equations in the same way as the particle - frame case with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being kept finite .",
    "the resultant equations are given by eq.s ( [ eq:2 - 021 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 - 023 ] ) , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the enthalpy .",
    "it is noted that these equations are reduced to the constitutive equations by landau if we can set @xmath59 .    by applying the above argument to the entropy current at most bilinear with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ,",
    "we can obtain the relaxation equations with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being finite , which make up the so - called second - order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equations together with the conservation laws in eq.s ( [ eq:2 - 001 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 - 002 ] ) @xcite .",
    "now the dissipative part of the energy - momentum tensor satisfies @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "as emphasized before , the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be determined only from a microscopic theory .",
    "the phenomenological theory can not proceed further because no such logic to determine them is implemented in the theory . in the following section",
    ", we shall show that the microscopic theory gives @xmath83 together with @xmath84 in the particle frame while @xmath59 in the energy frame , and hence @xmath0 but @xmath85 in the particle frame .",
    "this fact tells us that the usual constraint employed for the particle frame must be abandoned , and all the analyses based on this constraint should be redone .",
    "the argument so far is in the stage of thermodynamics where the argument is robust but the parameters such as @xmath52 and @xmath53 as well as the equations of state @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 appearing in the theory remain undetermined .",
    "the problem which we encounter is how to reduce a dynamical equation to a slower one described with fewer dynamical variables . for this purpose",
    ", we will investigate the infrared limit of the relativistic boltzmann equation with use of a powerful reduction method , the `` rg method '' @xcite .",
    "the rg method is a systematic reduction theory of the dynamics leading to the coarse - graining of temporal and spatial scales .",
    "the full presentation of the reduction of the relativistic boltzmann equation to the second - order hydrodynamic equation is technical and involved .",
    "so we here only present main results with key several equations , leaving the detailed account to another publication @xcite , although the derivation of a wide class of the first - order equations is presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "we start with the simple relativistic boltamann equation , @xmath86_p(x ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 denotes the one - particle distribution function defined in the phase space @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the four momentum of the on - shell particle .",
    "the right - hand side of eq.([eq:2.1.1 ] ) is the collision integral , @xmath90_p(x ) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2 ! } \\ ,",

    "f_{p_1}(x ) ) $ ] , where @xmath91 denotes the transition probability owing to the microscopic two - particle interaction .",
    "we are interested in the hydrodynamical regime where the time- and space - dependence of the physical quantities are small . in another word ,",
    "the time and space entering the hydrodynamic equation are the ones coarse - grained from those in the kinetic equation .",
    "thus we are lead to introduce a macroscopic lorentz vector , @xmath92 which specifies the covariant coordinate system and we call the _ macroscopic - frame vector_. with use of @xmath92 , we define the macroscopic covariant coordinate system @xmath93 as @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we note that the small quantity @xmath96 has been introduced to tag that the space derivatives are small for the system we are interested in .",
    "@xmath96 may be identified with the ratio of the average particle distance over the mean free path , i.e. , the knudsen number .    in this coordinate system ,",
    "eq.([eq:2.1.1 ] ) can be cast into @xmath97_p(\\tau \\,,\\ , \\sigma )      - \\varepsilon \\ ,",

    "has a form to which the perturbative expansion with respect to @xmath96 can be applied . in the perturbative expansion",
    ", we shall take the coordinate system where @xmath102 has no @xmath103 dependence , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "the zeroth - order approximate solution we construct is a stationary solution , which is identical to a local equilibrium distribution function given by the juetner function @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "note that this solution contains five would - be integration constants , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath6 with @xmath7 , which can be identified with the temperature , the chemical potential , and the fluid velocity , respectively .",
    "the collision integral is expanded around the zeroth - order solution and is reduced to the linear operator @xmath106_p$ ] .",
    "furthermore , it is found to be convenient to convert @xmath107 to @xmath108_{pq}$ ] , with the diagonal matrix @xmath109 .",
    "we also define the inner product between arbitrary vectors @xmath110 and @xmath111 by @xmath112 with this inner product , we can define a normed linear space .",
    "now the first - order solution is given in terms of the five zero modes of @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the corresponding variables are just @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath6 with @xmath115 .",
    "the zero modes span a linear space @xmath116 , which is an invariant manifold for the asymptotic dynamics of the relativistic boltamann equation in the terminology in the dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "then the second - order solution is given by incorporating the next slow modes , which span a linear space @xmath117 .",
    "we naturally require @xmath117 is orthogonal to @xmath118 , that is , @xmath119 .",
    "we find that @xmath117 is expanded by the bilinear forms of momenta ; @xmath120_p$ ] , where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the projection to complement to @xmath116 . by definition , @xmath123 is satisfied .",
    "note that the dimension of @xmath124 is nine , which correspond to the number of the new would - be integration constants , @xmath35 , @xmath125 with @xmath126 , and @xmath40 with @xmath47 and @xmath127 .",
    "a generic choice of the macroscopic frame vector is @xmath128 , where @xmath16 is a parameter defining the frame .",
    "for example , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) gives the energy ( particle ) frame .",
    "the resultant generic relaxation equations of the second - order hydrodynamic equation with @xmath16 being kept are @xmath131 here , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are the thermodynamic forces ; their simple forms retaining only @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are the usual constitutive equations .",
