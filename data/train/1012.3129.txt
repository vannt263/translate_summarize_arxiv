    "the mass of the strange quark has a peculiar value , being close to the scale parameter of qcd , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the light quarks ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) have a mass small enough so that theoretical tools , such as chiral perturbation theory , can be used to describe the dynamics of these quarks .",
    "on the other hand , the heavy quarks ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) have a mass large enough so that non - relativistic potential theories , such as heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , can be used for the dynamic of these quarks .",
    "the strange quark is too heavy for chiral dynamics and too light for hqet , which makes it difficult to describe theoretically @xcite .    because of the theoretical difficulty to describe the dynamics of the strange quark , it is important to measure the properties of particles with non - zero strangeness in order to provide guidance for theoretical models .",
    "for example , it has been debated for some time @xcite whether the structure of the first excited state of the @xmath10 baryon , the @xmath0 with @xmath11 , is a @xmath12 bound state or a orbital excitation of the @xmath13 valence quarks in a conventional baryon quark model .",
    "the former would have strong 5-quark components in its wave - function , whereas the latter would have a predominantly 3-quark component .",
    "the fact that this issue is still not resolved is a testiment to the theoretical ambiguities in the dynamics of the strange quark .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration has collected high - quality data for photoproduction of baryons with non - zero strangeness .",
    "the large statistics for these measurements forces constraints on theoretical models of strangeness production that were not possible previously .",
    "in particular , photoproduction of the ground state hyperons @xmath10 and @xmath14 shows evidence for a new nucleon resonance ( @xmath15 ) that couples strongly to strangeness decay , which may explain why it was not seen in partial wave analysis of pion scattering experiments .",
    "the search for @xmath15 resonances is important because significantly fewer @xmath15 s are observed than are predicted by quark models @xcite , known as the  missing \" resonances problem .",
    "in addition to data on photoproduction of the ground state hyperons , data on hyperon resonances ( with an associated kaon ) and on kaon resonances ( with a ground state hyperon ) are now being released .",
    "these new data allow further investigations into the dynamics of the strange quark in mesons and baryons .",
    "the clas detector , located at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility , is a large acceptance spectrometer with a toroidal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "beams of electrons or photons ( produced via bremsstrahlung ) with energies up to 6 gev are incident on target of hydrogen , deuterium , or nuclear targets at the center of clas . for photoproduction , the energy of the photon is given by a tagging detector which records the momentum of scattered electrons .",
    "multi - particle final states are detected at clas with high rates , providing billions of triggered events .",
    "results for the reaction @xmath16 measured at clas have been published @xcite and are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "of special interest , as mentioned above , is the observation of new @xmath15 resonances using both cross sections and polarization data .",
    "curiously , the @xmath10 is polarized nearly 100% in the direction of circularly polarized photons @xcite which was not predicted by any theoretical reaction model before the clas measurements .",
    "the precision of the clas data has sparked new theoretical interest in strangeness production .",
    "the primary focus of the current report is on hyperon resonances .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting results in the past decade from clas measurements is for the reaction @xmath17 , where the decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 were measured simultaneously . in a constituent quark model , where the @xmath0 is described as an orbital excitation of the ground - state @xmath20",
    ", these two decays should be isospin symmetric .",
    "however , in models where the @xmath0 is dynamically generated @xcite , interference between the @xmath12 and @xmath21 poles can produce asymmetric decays .",
    "the carnegie melon university group at clas @xcite measured dramatically different decays for the @xmath22 , showing that this hyperon resonance has a more complex structure than predicted by simple quark models .",
    "this is the first time that clear isospin interference has been observed in the strong decay of a well established baryon resonance .",
    "few data exist for photoproduction of the @xmath24 resonance , which is a partner to the well - known @xmath25 resonance in the baryon decuplet .",
    "this is due in part to the difficulty of separating the @xmath26 at a mass of 1.385 gev from the @xmath0 resonance , which overlap due to their natural decay widths .",
    "hence , the first differential cross sections with reasonable statistics were measured for @xmath27 photoproduction from the neutron @xcite , where the neutral @xmath10 resonances are not seen .",
    "more precise measurements are being analyzed for @xmath24 photoproduction at clas , but are still very preliminary .     for the reaction @xmath28 showing peaks at the masses of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 resonances .",
    "the vertical scale shows counts . ]",
    "one result of particular interest is the electromagnetic ( em ) decay of the @xmath26 to the @xmath31 final state , which was published by clas @xcite .",
    "the em decay can be calculated exactly for a given theoretical model , and gives direct information on the wave - function of the baryon .",
    "precise measurements have been made for the @xmath32 transition , yet no useful data were available for the @xmath33 transitions before the clas measurement .    using a recent high - statistics data set , the @xmath34  em decay has been remeasured at clas , reducing the statistical uncertainty from about 30% to about 10% .",
    "the smaller uncertainty is important , because effects from the pion cloud give a @xmath3530% increase in the theoretical prediction @xcite for @xmath32 at low @xmath36 , which is necessary for agreement with data .",
    "the published clas decay width for @xmath34 is about a factor of two larger than theoretical predictions ( for a range of theoretical models ) @xcite , suggesting that meson cloud effects are significant .",
    "the new ( preliminary ) clas results for this em decay width are consistent with the earlier results , but have much better precision . to show the quality of the new data , the missing mass off the @xmath37 for the events of interest are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigstar ] .",
    "some background is seen under the @xmath26 peak at 1.385 gev , which is mostly eliminated by a cut on the confidence level of a kinematic fit to the final state .",
    "the key step in the analysis is to separate the strong decay @xmath38 from the em decay , which can be done reliably using kinematic fits .",
    "knowledge of the quark structure of the @xmath24 resonance is important , as it is the lowest - lying excited state of the strange baryons .",
    "being a member of the baryon decuplet , along with the @xmath25 resonance , it has spin @xmath39 . in the simple quark model",
    ", the decuplet baryons are visualized as a purely symmetric spin state of three valence quarks .",
    "relationships between the decuplet baryons can be calculated using isospin ( @xmath40-spin ) and the analogue @xmath41-spin @xmath42 flavor symmetries .",
    "however , it is known that @xmath42 symmetries are broken , and the degree of symmetry breaking is something that experiments can measure",
    ". a broader program of measuring em decays from a variety of the decuplet baryons with strangeness is in progress at clas , and will provide a window into the quark substructure of these baryons .     measured at clas . ]      before a recent clas publication @xcite , few data existed for photoproduction of the @xmath44 vector meson , the spin-1 partner to the scalar kaon .",
    "the interest in @xmath2 photoproduction is , in part , to understand how spin is transferred from the photon to the strange quark . in the spin-0 kaon",
    ", the polarization of the @xmath45-quark can only be inferred through measurements of @xmath10 decay in the reaction @xmath16 . as mentioned above",
    ", there appears to be nearly complete transfer of spin from a circularly polarized photon to the @xmath10 .",
    "when the kaon is replaced by a @xmath2 , the @xmath2 now carries some of the spin , providing new reaction dynamics .",
    "preliminary differential cross sections for the @xmath46 reaction measured at clas are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kstar ] .",
    "these angular distributions are for increasing photon energies near threshold , and have small statistical uncertainties ( error bars are smaller than the symbols for most bins ) .",
    "these are the world s first high - statistics data for this reaction , and theorists are now developing models @xcite for comparision with these data .",
    "in addition to the @xmath47 cross sections , preliminary results for the @xmath10 polarization from unpolarized beam show that there is less induced polarization compared with @xmath48 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath49 production from polarized photons will be measured in the near future .    because the @xmath2 is a vector meson , it is possible to construct the spin - density matrix elements for @xmath50 photoproduction .",
    "preliminary results show substantial spin effects near threshold , similar to those seen for @xmath51-meson photoproduction .",
    "this suggests that significant spin transfer effects are seen to the @xmath2 , as predicted by theory @xcite .    within the context of a theoretical model ,",
    "diagrams corresponding to @xmath9-channel exchange of virtual mesons show that the scalar meson , @xmath3 with @xmath52 , can contribute to the forward - angle cross sections and spin observables .",
    "the existence of the @xmath3 ( also called the kappa - meson ) has been under discussion for many years .",
    "if it exists , it is probably the strange partner to the well established @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons in a scalar nonet .",
    "the @xmath3 is not seen directly as a peak in the @xmath55 invariant mass , presumably due to its wide width ( since it can easily  fall apart \" into @xmath55 because of its @xmath56 spin - parity ) .",
    "a similar argument is made for the purported @xmath57-meson , which would be the singlet member of this scalar nonet .",
    "the @xmath3 does not contribute to kaon photoproduction @xmath9-channel , so only data for @xmath2 photoproduction can support or weaken the case for the existence of the @xmath3 .",
    "so far , the case for the @xmath3 is supported by the decay distributions of heavy mesons ( such as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , see @xcite ) but the evidence remains ambiguous .",
    "data for linearly polarized beam for @xmath60 photoproduction , which has been measured at leps , will provide an unambiguous signal of the @xmath3 , if it exists .",
    "similarly , the ratio of @xmath47 and @xmath60 photoproduction total cross sections as a function of photon energy is predicted to be sensitive to the existence of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "analysis of these data are in progress .",
    "the multi - particle data from high - statistics photon beams at clas have provided a rich source of results on hyperon resonance production .",
    "one example is the suggestion of a new nucleon resonance that couples strongly to the @xmath61 final state , which was further identified by the study of spin - transfer to the @xmath10 from circularly polarized beam .",
    "of particular note is the isospin interference effects seen in the decays of the @xmath0 hyperon resonance .",
    "models of the structure of hyperon resonances can be constrained by measurements of em decays , which do not suffer from the ambiguities of strong decays . although em decays are much harder to measure , due to their small branching ratios , the results are more interesting because of the unambiguous predictions within a given quark model .",
    "results for both @xmath32 and @xmath34 are larger than simple quark model predictions . in the case of the @xmath25 ,",
    "the pion cloud makes a significant enhancement to the em transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "similar meson cloud effects are now being investigated for the @xmath24 em decay .    for @xmath2 photoproduction",
    ", high - precision data are just now becoming available .",
    "current theoretical models are phenomenological , and data are necessary to constrain the various coupling constants in the model .",
    "one unconstrained parameter is the contribution of the @xmath3 scalar meson , which is not firmly established .",
    "the existence of the @xmath3 would fill in the missing places in the meson nonet that includes the well established @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons , and hence it is important to measure @xmath2 photoproduction reactions to see whether the data are described with diagrams that require @xmath3 exchange in the @xmath9-channel",
