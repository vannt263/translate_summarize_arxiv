    "we model the extra degree of freedom at a single esp at @xmath15 by an additional light scalar field coupled to the inflaton via the interaction lagrangian @xmath16 for simplicity , we assume canonical kinetic terms and an identical coupling @xmath10 between the inflatons and the extra fields . if the bare mass @xmath17 is small and @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the hubble parameter , particle production during an esp encounter can be computed analytically , identical to particle production during preheating @xcite .",
    "the produced particle density depends sensitively on the distance of closest approach , i.e.  the impact parameter @xmath21 so that @xmath22 evidently , if @xmath23 , particle production is suppressed and this particular esp can be neglected .",
    "however , if the trajectory comes closer , a fraction of the inflatons kinetic energy is transferred to @xmath24-particles . as the trajectory moves away from the esp ,",
    "these particles become heavy and , via the coupling in ( [ lint ] ) , lead to an attractive force towards the esp that diminishes over time in an expanding universe , @xmath25 .",
    "such a single encounter can slow down , bend and , for strong coupling , temporarily trap the trajectory @xcite . while interesting effects similar to the curvaton scenario can result for such a single encounter @xcite",
    ", we wish to consider the other extreme of a dense esp distribution , so that individual encounters become indistinguishable from each other .    due to the exponential suppression in ( [ suppression ] ) , only esps in a cylinder around the trajectory with radius of order @xmath26 need to be considered . if @xmath27 , esps are encountered individually as in @xcite , if at all . on the other hand , if @xmath28 , many esps are close enough to the trajectory at any given time for particle production to take place .",
    "since we distribute esps homogeneously , no particular direction is singled out .",
    "hence , if the trajectory in field space is sufficiently straight in the absence of esps , the resulting backreaction of the produced @xmath24 particles onto the inflatons is opposite to the velocity @xmath29",
    ".    let s consider inflatons placed somewhere high up in a steep potential @xmath30 : initially at rest , the fields accelerate due to the gradient . as long as @xmath31 , hardly any esps are in reach and the inflatons keep accelerating .",

    "if @xmath33 dips below @xmath34 , the speed picks up again due to the gradient of the potential .",

    "several conditions need to be satisfied ( see @xcite for more details ) :    1 .   the potential needs to be steep enough to ignore hubble friction , yielding the condition @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 , the slow roll regime is entered before the terminal velocity is reached .",
    "2 .   to avoid prolonged oscillations around @xmath3 , the time for backreaction to act needs to be smaller than the characteristic time needed to change the speed due to the potential .",
    "this entails the lower bound @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   the trajectory should not be strongly curved over a few hubble times , so that backreaction is approximately anti - parallel to the velocity and the gradient , yielding the upper bound @xmath48 .",
    "4 .   the potential energy needs to dominate over the kinetic energy which in turn needs to be bigger than the energy in produced particles , to guarantee that inflation takes place .",
    "at least @xmath49 e - folds of inflation are needed to solve the standard problems of the big bang .",
    "the study of perturbations in trapped inflation is subtle , since backreaction of @xmath24 particles onto the background is included at the level of the equations of motion , not the lagrangian . in the one dimensional case ,",
    "an analysis of perturbations in @xmath42 in the uniform curvature gauge for a desitter background is given in @xcite , which can be generalized to our case .",

    ", this back - scattering effect leads to a bump in the power - spectrum , accompanied by a ( suppressed ) ringing pattern @xcite .",
    "a dense superposition of these bumps should lead to a nearly scale invariant contribution to the power - spectrum , that can reach the cobe limit if @xmath10 is sufficiently large , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we expect the this second contribution to dominate over the intrinsic power - spectrum without tuning , in line with the results of @xcite .",

    "we will show that this contribution @xmath7 carries an observationally ruled out blue spectral index so that it must be sub - dominant , leading to an upper bound on @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the intrinsic power - spectrum has to saturate the cobe bound while satisfying observational constraints on the scalar spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio or an additional mechanism has to be invoked to provide the power - spectrum .",
    "in the former case , fields move at the terminal velocity while scales in the observational window leave the horizon ; a regular slow roll regime is entered thereafter .",

    "thus , the slow roll regime is operational for @xmath75 with @xmath76 at which the potential slow roll parameter equals one , while inflation is driven at the terminal velocity for @xmath77 , see fig .",

    "a second difference compared to @xcite is that esps are not encountered head on , but distributed around the trajectory and passed in rapid succession . as a result ,",
    "particle production at a single esp is suppressed by an impact parameter @xmath90 , i.e.  , the distance of closest approach to the esp , leading to @xmath91 , which carries over to the energy density in ( [ rhochi ] ) and all associated effects .",
    "these consequences were computed in @xcite , where it was shown that particle production , and thus backreaction , is dominated by esps with impact parameters close to @xmath92 particle production of esps further away is exponentially suppressed , while esps closer to the trajectory are too few to affect the dynamics strongly if @xmath4 is large ; the latter is a direct consequence of the fact that most of the volume , and thus esps , in a hypersphere is close to its surface in the large d limit .",
    "thus , the corresponding particle density @xmath93 carries a suppression factor of @xmath94 , which in turn carries directly over to @xmath95 ; we may thus write the cumulative contribution to the power - spectrum from back - scattering as @xmath96 with @xmath97 and we defined the effective esp line - density @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the volume of a @xmath100 dimensional unit - sphere .",

    "the interval for @xmath10 is not particularly wide , but allowed values do not appear to be overly fine tuned either and cover the same range commonly considered for studies of preheating after inflation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fields at esps in the vicinity of the final resting place can act as preheat matter fields , as investigated in @xcite : there , it was found that preheating is qualitatively different than in models that have an esp at the vev of the inflatons ; while de - phasing of inflatons tends to suppress parametric resonance @xcite ( see @xcite for the case of two inflations , that still permits resonances ) , two new effects leading to efficient preheating were found : particle production during the first in - fall can already comprise a seizable energy transfer if the trapped inflation regime lasts until preheating commences , but it is never complete .",

    "the index is always blue and therefore observationally ruled out by planck . as a consequence , @xmath7 needs to be sub - dominant , which leads to an upper bound on the coupling constant , @xmath157 for @xmath158 ( the lower bound is required by the employed method to compute particle production at esps ; it may be relaxed if the inflationary energy scale turns out to be considerably lower in trapped inflation compared to slow roll models , while still consistent with the cobe normalization . ) ; correspondingly , the average inter - esp distance needs to satisfy @xmath159 .",
    "values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 in these narrow intervals provide the remaining parameter space for trapped inflation at a terminal velocity .    given these narrow ranges , the appeal of trapped inflation is reduced as fine - tuning re - emerges to suppress the contribution to the power - spectrum from backscattering .",
    "further , it is not clear if observational constraints can be met in this narrow range : the intrinsic power - spectrum needs to be computed to check whether or not the amplitude and spectral index of the power - spectrum as well as the tensor to scalar ratio are consistent with observations .",
    "further , the lower bound on @xmath11 indicates that preheating at esps after inflation is most likely ineffective ; hence , inflatons decay either via tachyonic instabilities or the standard theory of reheating . an additional contribution to non - gaussianities from backscattering",
    "is present , but given that @xmath7 needs to be sub - dominant , we expect these non - gaussianities to be below observational bounds .                                                                                                                                                                                                      j.  c.  bueno sanchez and k.  dimopoulos , phys .",
