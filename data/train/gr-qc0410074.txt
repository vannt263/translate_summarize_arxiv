    "analog models of general relativity have received great attention in the last few years , since it is believed that these models are shedding light on possible experimental verifications of some fundamental problems in black hole physics , such as the evaporation of black holes and semiclassical quantities .",
    "the idea of using supersonic acoustic flows as analog systems to mimic some properties of black hole physics was proposed for the first time by unruh @xcite ( for a comprehensive review of analog black holes see @xcite and references therein , and for a pedagogical review see @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the basis of the analogy between gravitational black hole and sonic black holes comes from considering the propagation of acoustic disturbances on a barotropic , inviscid , inhomogeneous and irrotational ( at least locally ) fluid flow .",
    "it is well known that the equation of motion for this acoustic disturbance ( described by its velocity potential @xmath1 ) is identical to the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in a curved spacetime @xcite@xcitevisser:1993ub .",
    "therefore , this analogy gives us a powerful terrestrial laboratory to explore principal aspects of black hole physics , for example , the hawking radiation with its significant consequence about the paradox of information loss , quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , known as the  ringing  of black holes , also play an important role in classical aspects of black holes physics . in particular , from hod s proposal @xcite , modes with high damping have received great attention , specially their relevance in the quantization of the area of black holes and the possibilities of fixing the immirzi @xmath2 parameter in loop quantum gravity @xcite kunstatter:2002pj . in principle",
    "all these processes can be studied in a laboratory using the analog models of gravity .    in this work",
    "we analytically compute the qnms or acoustic disturbances in a rotating @xmath0 dimensional sonic black hole ( draining bathtub fluid flow ) , following the methodology developed in refs.@xcite and basak:2002aw .",
    "we also compute the adiabatic invariant proposed by kunstatter @xcite , and we compute the equivalent area spectrum for this acoustic black hole via bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule . for a @xmath0 dimensional pure spinning black hole called perfect vortex fischer:2001jz",
    "we show explicitly the absence of superresonance phenomena and the absence of qnms .",
    "we conjecture that this acoustic space behaves like the btz extremal black hole @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we specify the draining vortex , the notation and some useful quantities for this acoustic geometry . in sec .",
    "iii we determine the qnms , mass and the area spectrum in the large damping limits . in sec .",
    "iv we treat the perfect vortex and explicty compute the absence of the superresonance and qnms for this acoustic black hole . finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "the rotating @xmath0 acoustic black hole was proposed by visser for the first time in ref.@xcite which corresponds to a draining bathtub fluid flow with a sink at the origin .",
    "the velocity profile for this configuration is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary real positive constants .",
    "if we assume the fluid to be locally irrotational , the background velocity potential becomes    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is some length scale ( we adopt @xmath8 ) .",
    "the acoustic line element is given by @xmath9being @xmath10 the constant velocity of sound . in order to study the general properties of this acoustic spacetime",
    ", we perform the coordinate transformations discussed in ref.@xcite , namely    @xmath11    so that the metric adopts a kerr - like form    @xmath12    the radii of  the horizon and ergosphere for this acoustic black hole are respectively @xmath13by considering the komar @xcite integrals we can calculate two conserved charges , conserved in the sense that they are generated by divergenceless currents @xmath14 ,   \\label{mass1}\\ ] ]    @xmath15    though we have labelled these conserved charges @xmath16 and @xmath17 they do not represent the physical mass and angular momentum of the spacetime , such an identification would require the use of the einstein equations , which do not apply in the current context .",
    "it is straightforward to take the limit of static acoustic black holes ( @xmath18 ) for these conserved charges .",
    "but if we take the limit of pure spinning acoustic black holes ( perfect vortex @xmath19 in ( [ metric1 ] ) ) the @xmath16 charge is undefined and we must use an independent method such an used for extremal black holes in general relativity .",
    "other interesting quantities for the study of black hole physics are the angular velocity of the horizon    @xmath20    and the surface gravity    @xmath21    which allows to define the analogous to the hawking temperature :    @xmath22    in the quantum version of this system we can hope that the acoustic black hole emits acoustic hawking radiation .",
    "this effect coming from the horizon of events is a pure kinematical effect that occurs in any lorenzian geometry independent of its dynamical content@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the acoustic metric does not satisfy the einstein equations , due to the fact that the background fluid motion is governed by the continuity and the euler equations . as a consequence of this fact",
    ", one should expect that the thermodynamic description of the acoustic black hole is ill defined .",
    "however , this powerful analogy between black hole physics and acoustic geometry allows to extend the study of many physical quantities associated to black holes , such as quasinormal modes and area spectrum . in the next section we consider this aspect",
    "the basis of the analogy between einstein black holes and sonic black holes comes from considering the propagation of acoustic disturbances on a barotropic , inviscid , inhomogeneous and irrotational fluid flow .",
    "it is well known that the equation of motion for these acoustic disturbances ( described by its velocity potential @xmath1 ) is identical to the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in a curved spacetime @xcite@xcite@xcite , _ i.e. _    @xmath23    we make the ansatz @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a real constant and in order to make @xmath26 single valued , @xmath25 must take on integer values.the radial function @xmath27 satisfies @xcite the following equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30    solutions of ( [ rr ] ) were found in ref.@xcite using an adaptation of the matching procedure developed by starobinsky . in order to solve the radial equation ( [ rr ] ) they considered a new radial function defined by    @xmath31 ~~l(r)~.\\ ] ]    and then , through a matching procedure for the region @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the radial equation for @xmath34 is transformed in the riemann - papparitz equation whose solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions read as follows    @xmath35    where    @xmath36    and @xmath37    in order to compute the qnms , we need to impose the boundary conditions upon the solution of the radial equation , meaning that only purely ingoing waves are allows at the horizon , that is , @xmath38 ( since nothing comes out of the horizon ) while @xmath34 is given by @xmath39we also need to know the behavior of @xmath34 in the asymptotic region ( @xmath40 )    @xmath41 where the constant coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by    @xmath44    we require that only outgoing waves should be present at the infinity . to see this condition we consider the possible values for @xmath45 :    @xmath46    this set of conditions can be summarized in the following condition :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a positive integer . then , from ( [ ndef ] ) we obtain the frequencies of the qnms    @xmath49    being @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in particular , the case of highly damped modes ( _ i.e. _ qnms with a large imaginary part )",
    "has received great attention in the last time specially regarding their relevance in the quantization of the area of black holes and the possibilities of fixing the immirzi  @xmath52 parameter in loop quantum gravity through qnms . in the present case and as a consequence of the starobinsky matching procedure meaning @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , the spectrum of frequencies for @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 and the imaginary part of the spectrum is vanishes , a result that differs from the gravitational case .",
    "let us note that in order to satisfy @xmath57 , we also must have @xmath58 .    on the other hand , in the sense of hod @xcite , @xcite the real part of the spectrum of qnms of the black holes does not give the correct schwarzschild limit @xmath59 .",
    "the absence of the schwarzschild asymptotic limit was claimed in ref.@xcite and its absence can be understood because the hod s conjecture is fundamentally based on black hole thermodynamics . at this point",
    ", we remark that the sonic metric does not satisfy the einstein equations .",
    "therefore , a thermodynamics scheme of acoustic black holes inspired from black hole physics in general relativity does not apply in the acoustic case .",
    "now , we consider re@xmath60 to be a fundamental vibrational frequency for a black hole of energy @xmath61 . given a system with energy @xmath62 and vibrational frequency @xmath63 one can show that the quantity    @xmath64    is an adiabatic invariant @xcite which via bohr - sommerfeld quantization , has an equally spaced spectrum in the semi - classical limit :    @xmath65    now by taking re@xmath66 in this context we have ( @xmath17 fixed )    @xmath67    and the mass spectrum becomes    @xmath68 .\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the perimeter of the horizon of the black hole is given by    @xmath69    and as a consequence of the mass spectrum , the area spectrum becomes @xmath70 , \\ ] ] where we can see that both mass spectrum and area spectrum are not equally spaced against to the schwarzschild black hole @xcite @xcite .",
    "the conserved charges @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not independent in the acoustic case ( [ mass1 ] , [ angular1 ] ) . since the constant @xmath5 establishes their relationship .",
    "if we express these charges in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( physical parameters of sonic black hole )    @xmath73 , \\\\ j & = & \\frac{1}{4}c^{2}a\\left ( \\frac{\\omega _ { + } } { 2\\pi t_{h}}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the parameter @xmath4 which is an arbitrary constant , can be freely defined and hence as a consequence of this we are left with a unique effective degree of freedom ( @xmath16 ) which allows an unambiguous computation of the adiabatic invariant .",
    "let us recall however that the present situation is not applicable to the btz @xcite @xcite of kerr black holes @xcite@xcite@xcite . in these later ones ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are effectively independent charges with no relation between them as described above .",
    "the perfect vortex is obtained when we replace @xmath19 in ( [ metric1 ] ) . in this case",
    "this spacetime ( acoustic vortex ) represents a fluid with a non - radial flow .",

    "@xcite @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to check that the wronskian of these approximate solutions is constant , such that @xmath93we can observe the absence of the super - resonance for the perfect vortex , meaning that it is impossible to have @xmath94 , despite the fact that this geometry exhibits an ergosphere . to the best our knowledge there is no gravitational black hole exhibits this behavior . by virtue of the results report in refs.gamboa:2000uc , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we could make the conjecture that the extreme btz black hole could be a possible candidate @xcite . at this point",
    "we notice that our results are valid when the local velocity of the sound is a constant .",
    "certainly this fact is different from the physical situation found in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) where it is well known that the sound velocity is proportional to the density @xcite @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the perfect vortex in the case of @xmath10 constant was discussed for the first time in the ref .",

    "this behavior is analogous to the case of btz extreme black hole @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is an infinite tower of ordinary well behaved normal modes in the limit of the starobinsky matching procedure and it is straightforward to show that this spectrum contains only positive frequencies according to ( [ wcondition ] ) ( see appendix ) .",

    "we have found the explicit expression of the qnms spectrum , and for highly damping modes this spectrum contains only real frequencies .",
    "we note that this last result is similar to the one proposed by hod in ref.@xcite for the asymptotic real spectrum of the qnms of rotating black holes ( kerr black holes ) .",
