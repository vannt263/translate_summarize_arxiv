    "the stock market crash on monday oct .",
    "19 , 1987 led to the _ october black monday syndrome_. on that day , the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) lost 21.6  % .",
    "other markets were shaken : the worst decline reached 45.8  % in hong kong .",
    "the downturn was spread out over two or three days in different european stock markets : the dax lost 10  % .",
    "nevertheless most markets had been using for a long time _ breakers _ ,",
    "i.e. periods of trading halts and/or limitations of daily variations .",
    "this tends to suggest that the adoption of circuit breakers at the very least do delay the crash process , and not much more .",
    "in fact , lauterbach and ben - zion @xcite found that trading halts and price limits had no impact on the overall decline of october 1987 , but merely smoothed return fluctuations in the neighborhood of the crash .",
    "another major characteristic of the crash of october 1987 is the phenomenon of irresistible contagion .",
    "it is well accepted that the shock arose first from asian markets , except japan , then propagated to the european markets before reaching the american markets after , when asian markets were already closed @xcite .",
    "a mapping of the nikkei , dax and djia daily sign fluctuations has been made onto a 1/2 ising spin chain as if there was a continuous index calculated three times during 24 hours .",
    "this showed that the spin cluster fluctuations are rather equivalent to random fluctuations , - except during pre - crash periods in which ( @xmath4 ) spin clusters form with a higher probability than expected if the fluctuations are to be considered independent of each other @xcite .",
    "this has allowed to eliminate all criticisms about the major responsibility of the derivative markets in the united states on the oct .",
    "87 crash . since then",
    ", the world - wide interdependence of the economy has been going on still more strongly .",
    "thus if really a speculative bubble is occurring on some financial markets , as commonly observed in the recent years , the phenomenon of propagation to other stock exchanges could be more important now .",
    "it is known that methods of negotiation have widely changed on many financial places .",
    "markets using electronic systems of negotiation take advantage of recent improvement in their transaction capacity .",
    "it is easier today to face a substantial increase in transaction volumes during a major crisis period .",
    "moreover , the efficient use of the derivative markets could avoid useless pressures on the traditional market .",
    "these financial factual observations should be turned into quantitative measures , in order to , if necessary , avoid crashes .",
    "whence there is a need for techniques capable of rapidly following a bubble explosion or preventing it .",
    "notice that the drop of stock market indices can not only spread out over two or three days but also over a much longer period .",
    "the example of the tokyo stock exchange at the beginning of the 1990 s is a prominent illustration . by comparison to the most famous crash of 1929 , the oct .",
    "87 crash was spread over 2 days : the dow jones sank 12.8  % on october 28 and 11.7  % on the following day .",
    "( that was similar for the dax which dropped by 8.00  % and 7.00  % on oct .",
    "26 and 28 , 1987 respectively . )",
    "this shows that a stock market index decline does not necessarily lead to a crash in one single day .",
    "indeed , the decline can be slow and last several days or even several months in what would be called not a crash , but a long duration bear market .    in the present econophysics research context ,",
    "it is of interest to examine whether the evolution of quotations on the main stock exchange places have similarities and whether crash symptoms can be found .",
    "even if history generally tends to repeat , does it always do so in similar ways , and what are the differences ?",
    "a rise in quotations can be interpreted _ a posteriori _ as the result of a speculative bubble but could be mere euphoria .",
    "how this does lead to a rupture of the trend ? can the duration differences be interpreted ?",
    "can we find universality classes ?",
    "physics - like model of fracture or other phase transitions , including percolation can be turned into some economic advantage .",
    "along the same lines of thought , the question was already touched upon in @xcite within the sand pile model .",
    "this allows not only a verbal analogy of index rupture in terms of sand avalanches , but also some insight into the mechanisms .",
    "through physical modeling and an understanding of parameters controlling the output , as in the sand pile model , symptoms can be measured , whence to suggest remedies is not impossible .    another question raised below is the post - crash period .",
    "one might expect from a physics point of view that if a crash looks like a phase transition , and is characterized by scaling laws , as we will see it sometimes occurs @xcite , it might be expected that a relation exists between amplitudes and laws on both sides of the crash day @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the crash might be occurring on various days , with different breaks .",
    "it might be possible that between drops some positive surge might be found .",
    "thus some sorting of behaviors into classes should be made as well . _ in fine _ , some discussion on the foreign exchange market will be given in order to recall the detrended fluctuation analysis method , so often used nowadays .",
    "it is applied below to the @xmath1 exchange rate vs. the ( ten ) currencies forming the @xmath0 on jan .",
    "01 , 2000 , over a time interval including the most recent years .",
    "the observation of the time variation of the power law scaling exponent of the dfa function is shown to be correlated to crash time occurrence .      in 1559 ,",
    "the first tulip bulb ( tb ) was brought to holland from china by conrad guenster @xcite . in 1611 , the tulip bulbs ( tbs ) were stocked and sold on markets . in 1625 , one tulip bulb was worth 5 dutch gulden ( nlg ) .",
    "the flower was considered so rare that wealthy aristocrats and merchants tripped over themselves to buy the onions .",
    "speculation ensued and the tbs became wildly overvalued .",
    "the tbs were not necessarily planted , but were just stored in the house salon . in 1635 , 1",
    "tb was worth 4 tons of wheat + 4 oxen + 8 tons rye + 8 pigs + one bed + 12 sheep + clothes + 2 wine casks + 4 tons beer + 2 tons butter + 1000 pounds cheese + 1 silver drinking cup .",
    "in 1637 , 1 tb was worth 550 nlg .",
    "one average house was worth 17 800 nlg , whence about 30 tbs .",
    "however within 1637 , over a 6 week time span the price of 1 tb went down 90  % .    in view of the shock , remedies had to be found and people called upon the amsterdam parliament for legislation .",
    "it was decided that all contracts would be void if they were dealt before nov .",
    "1636 , and after that date the contracts kept a 10  % value . under some protest",
    ", people appealed to the netherland supreme court which ruled that this business of selling / buying tbs was mere gambling , and no debt could be defined `` by law '' nor ruled upon .",
    "nowadays one tb is worth 0.5 eur .",
    "too bad for long term investment strategies .",
    "the tb became the classical example for illustrating the _ extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds _ as described by charles mackay @xcite .",
    "just for the sake of physics history , let it be recalled that 1639 was the year in which galileo galilei ( pisa , feb . 15 , 1564 ; arcetri , jan . 8 , 1642 ) betrayed science in saving his life .",
    "another set of financial crises is that of the compagnie du mississipi @xcite and that of the south sea company @xcite . in 1715 ,",
    "john law , a scot gambler , had persuaded philippe , regent of france , to consider a banking scheme that promised to improve the financial condition of the kingdom . in theory a private affair , the system was linked from the beginning with liquidating the national debt . when the monopoly of the louisiana trade was surrendered in 1717 ,",
    "law created a trading company known as the _ compagnie doccident _ ( or _ compagnie du mississipi _ ) linked to the royal bank of france ( first chartered in 1716 as banque gnrale ) and in which government bills were accepted for the purchase of shares .",
    "law gained a monopoly on all french overseas trade .",
    "the result was a huge wave of speculation as the value of a share went from its initial value , i.e. 500 _ livres _ to 18 000 @xmath5 .",
    "when the paper money was presented at the bank in exchange for gold , which was unavailable , panic ensued , and shares felt by a factor of 2 in a matter of days .    in england",
    ", the whigs represented the mercantile interests which had profited from the war of the spanish succession war ( 1703 - 1711 ) , and made large profits by financing it , in doing so had created a national debt which had to be financed by further taxation . during the wars the government handled more money than ever before in history , and they skimmed off a lot through various methods , including the invention of the bank of england in 1694 .",
    "the south sea company was formed in 1711 by the tory government of harley to trade with spanish america , and to offset the financial support which the bank of england had provided for previous whig governments .",
    "they had in mind to establish a system like the compagnie du mississipi monopoly , @xcite using the same sort of trading privileges and monopolies , those granted to britain after the treaty of utrecht .",
    "king george i of great britain became governor of the company in 1718 , creating confidence in the enterprise , which was soon paying 100 percent interest .",
    "in 1720 a bill was passed enabling persons to whom the government owed portions of the national debt to exchange their claims for shares in company @xmath6 , and to become _",
    "stock holders_. in the 1719 - 20 the england public debt went to south sea company stock holders , as approved by parliament . on march 1",
    "the stocks were valued gbp 175 , moved quickly to 200 .",
    "shortly the directors of the south sea company had assumed three - fifths of the national debt .",
    "the company expected to recoup itself from expanding trade , but chiefly from the foreseen rise in the value of its shares .",
    "on june 1 the shares were valued 500 and more than 1,000 in august 1720 .",
    "those unable to buy south sea company stocks were inveigled by overly optimistic company promoters or downright swindlers into unwise investments .",
    "speculators took advantage of investors to obtain subscriptions for sensibly unrealistic projects . by september 1720 however",
    ", the market had collapsed , and by december 1720 south sea company shares were down to 124 , dragging others , including government stocks with them .",
    "many investors were ruined , and the house of commons ordered an inquiry , which showed that ministers had accepted bribes and speculated . from a physics point of view",
    "let it be recalled that i. newton ( woolsthorpe , dec .",
    "25 , 1642 ; london , march 20 , 1727 ) invested in such south sea company stocks and lost quite a bit of money @xcite .      in the years from 1925 to 1929",
    "one could easily go to a broker and purchase stocks on margin , i.e. instead of buying stocks with real cash money , one could purchase them with some cash down and the rest on credit .",
    "the coolidge administration had a _",
    "laissez - faire policy _ ,",
    "i.e. a government policy of non - intervention .",
    "it was almost _",
    "la faon de vivre _ to play in the stock market @xcite . that allowed a speculation bubble to grow unchecked .",
    "the federal reserve powers on economic matters were not utilized as could be done nowadays .",
    "many successions of @xmath7 crashes and rallies began as early as march 1929 .",
    "the summer of 1929 hearkened somewhat of the good old days of optimism .",
    "the market appeared to be stable . on sept .",
    "3 , a bear market became firmly established , and on thursday oct . 24 , 1929 the famous 1929 crash occurred ( fig .",
    "1 ) .",
    "the 1987 , 1997 , and more recent 1999 , 2000 , 2001 crashes are reminiscent and even copies of the above ones ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the symptoms look similar : artificially built euphoria , malingnantly established speculation , easy access to market activities , including manipulated ( or rather @xmath8 ) informations ... consider the buying frenzy on ipos stocks at the end of the 1990 s in companies for which owners do not have a coherent business plan , or are not going to make money , ... and yet see how we bought e - stocks .",
    "nothing has changed since 1600 , 1700 nor 1929 .",
    "econophysics @xcite aims to fill the huge gap separating  empirical finance  and `` econometric theories '' .",
    "various subjects have been approached like the option pricing , stock market data analysis , market modelling and forecasting , etc ... the application of statistical physics ideas to the forecasting of stock market behavior has been proposed earlier following the pioneer work of physicists interested by economy laws @xcite .",
    "even though a stock market crash is considered as a highly unpredictable event , it should be reemphasized that it takes place systematically during a period of generalized anxiety spreading over the markets following a euphoria time .",
    "the crash can be seen as a natural correction bringing the market to a `` normal state '' .",
    "three important facts should be underlined :    \\(i ) the series of daily fluctuations , so called @xmath9 , of the stock market presents a huge clustering around the crash date , i.e. huge fluctuations are grouped around the crash date .",
    "this is well illustrated in fig . 2 for the case of the dax around 1987 .",
    "the time span of this clustering is quite long : a few years .",
    "this clustering indicates that larger and larger fluctuations take place before crashes .",
    "\\(ii ) collective effects are to be considered , be they stemming from macroeconomy informations , as a set of `` external fields '' , and leading to a bear market , or more intrinsically @xmath10 , as if microeconomic informations ( or @xmath11 ) were triggering the non - equilibrium state evolution .",
    "\\(iii ) a third remark concerns the panic ",
    "correlations appearing before crashes .",
    "this kind of collective behavior is commonly observed during a trading day .",
    "the market in tokyo closes before london opens and thereafter new york opens . during periods of panic",
    ", financial analysts are looking for the results and evolution of the geographically preceding market .",
    "strong correlations are found in fluctuations of different market indices before crashes .",
    ", corresponding to the @xmath12 temperature bounding the critical fluctuation region , and the critical crash day(s ) @xmath13 ]    of course , fluctuations and correlations are both ingredients which are supposedly known to play an important role in phase transitions .",
    "thus an analogy can be derived ( fig.3 ) between phase transitions and crashes , defining the mean field ( exponential - like ) behavior , the time @xmath14 , corresponding to the @xmath12 temperature bounding the critical fluctuation region , the critical crash day @xmath13 , etc . @xcite .",
    "the character of a thermodynamic phase transition is characterized by critical exponents , following the scaling law hypothesis , exponents which are thought to depend on the symmetry of the order parameter and the underlying lattice dimensionality@xcite .",
    "similar considerations are looked for in financial crash studies .    in 1996",
    ", two independent works @xcite have proposed that critical phenomena would be possible scenarios for describing crashes .",
    "those authors are still debating about the subject @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it has been proposed that an economic index @xmath15 increases as a power law decorated with a log - periodic oscillation , i.e. @xmath16 \\hskip 0.3 cm   for   \\hskip 0.3 cm t < t_c\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the crash - time or rupture point , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free parameters .",
    "this evolution @xmath15 is in fact the real part @xmath23 of a power law behavior at @xmath24 with a complex exponent @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26the law for @xmath15 diverges at @xmath24 if @xmath27 .",
    "this evolution is decorated with oscillations converging at the rupture point @xmath13 .",
    "this law is similar to that of critical points , and generalizes the situation for cases in which a hierarchical lattice structure exists , in other words a discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) is subjacent @xcite .",
    "the relationship ( 1 ) has been proposed elsewhere in order to fit experimental measurements of sound wave rate emissions prior to the rupture of heterogeneous composite stressed up to failure @xcite .",
    "the same type of complex power law behavior has been also observed as a precursor of the kobe earthquake in japan @xcite .",
    "such log - periodic corrections have been recently reported in biased diffusion on random lattices @xcite .",
    "as early as april 1997 , vandewalle and ausloos performed a series of investigations in order to emphasize crash precursors @xcite .",
    "the closing values of the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) and the standard & poor 500 ( s&p500 ) were used for tests .",
    "a law slightly different from eq.(1 ) was proposed @xcite .",
    "a strong indication of a so - called crash event or market rupture point was numerically discovered @xcite .",
    "further data analysis ( in aug .",
    "97 ) @xcite including a risk measure @xcite indicated a crash to occur in between the end of october 1997 and mid - november 1997 .",
    "the crash occurred effectively on monday october 27th , 1997 @xcite !",
    "eventhough the crash of october 1997 was predicted @xcite , the scientific ( physics or economy ) @xcite and media @xcite community is actually divided between those who believe in such a crash prediction and those who believe that crashes are unpredictable events and such findings were mere luck or at best accidental @xcite .",
    "we discuss a little bit more the predictability problem and findings in this paper going beyond a previous report @xcite .      in e.g. refs.@xcite",
    ", the fact was underlined that there are strong physical arguments stipulating that @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) could be or even should be taken as `` universal '' .",
    "the universal @xmath28 value , i.e. a logarithmic divergence has been proposed .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the index @xmath29 for @xmath30 close to @xmath13 reads @xmath31 \\hskip 0.3 cm for   \\hskip 0.3 cm   t < t_c .\\ ] ] one should remark that the full period @xmath32 $ ] for a meaningful fit should contain the whole euphoric precursor .",
    "it has been found in @xcite that the log - divergence is closer to the real signal than any power law divergence with @xmath19 @xmath33 0 .",
    "the log - divergence in eq.(3 ) contains 6 parameters . at first",
    ", it seems that non - linear fits using only the simple log - divergent function @xmath34 with @xmath35 , thus with only 3 parameters can be performed .",
    "a good estimation of @xmath13 can be obtained indeed following both levenberg - marquardt and monte - carlo algorithms @xcite .",
    "one has observed that the estimated @xmath13 points are close to `` black '' days for the first two periods @xcite .",
    "assuming that eq.(4 ) is valid , one should also note that @xmath36should be found in the daily fluctuation pattern ( fig .",
    "this is consistent with the volatility clustering discussed here above .",
    "however , eq.(5 ) fits lead to bad results with huge error bars .",
    "the oscillating term of eq.(3 ) has been quite criticized since no traditional or economical argument supports the dsi theory at this time .",
    "however , the hierarchical structure of the market has been suggested as a possible candidate for generating dsi patterns in @xcite , so is the price fixing",
    " techniques  @xcite and arbitrage methods . in order to prove that a log - periodic pattern appears before crashes ,",
    "the _ envelope _ of the index @xmath29 is constructed @xcite .",
    "two distinct curves are built : the upper envelope @xmath37 and the lower one @xmath38 .",
    "the former represents the maximum of @xmath29 in an interval @xmath39 $ ] and the latter is the minimum of @xmath29 in an interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "one observes a remarkable pattern made of a succession of thin and huge peaks @xcite .",
    "when @xmath41 , it means that the index @xmath29 reaches some value never reached before at a time @xmath30 and would never have reached if the time axis had been reversed thereafter .",
    "this corresponds to time intervals during which the value of the index @xmath29 reaches new records .",
    "in fact , the pattern reflects obviously an oscillatory precursor of the crash , thus through @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are parameters controlling the amplitude of the oscillations .",

    "moreover we plot the result for a false @xmath0 , i.e. a linear combination of the ten currencies forming the @xmath0 @xcite except for @xmath79 , the functions are very close to a power law with an exponent @xmath80 holding over two decades in time , i.e. from about one week to two years .",
    "this finding clearly shows the non - existence of lrplc in the foreign exchange market with respect to the @xmath1 .",
    "other cases showing marked deviations from brownian motion have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it can then be observed that a wide variety of behaviors is found in the foreign currency exchange market .",
    "exponent values and the range over which a power law holds drastically vary from a currency exchange rate to another .",
    "it appears that the currency exchange rates can be classified into three different categories from the lrplc point of view .",
    "exponent for the 11 exchange rates of interest for @xmath81 .",
    "the fit slope being only of interest , the dfa function data has been arbitrarily displaced along the vertical axis ]    first , the rates which exhibit an exponent @xmath3 larger than 1/2 ( persistent behavior ) . this case corresponds to currency exchange rates between leading currencies ( e.g. , @xmath1 , @xmath82 , @xmath0 ) and so called @xmath83 ones @xcite .",
    "a second category concerns the rates exhibiting strict randomness ( @xmath84 ) within error bars .",
    "this is the case for example of the @xmath85 rates as shown above .",
    "a third category represents the currency exchange rates with antipersistent behavior ( @xmath86 ) as e.g. @xmath87 @xcite . these currencies most often concern currency exchange rates between ( european ) countries which are submitted to strict monetary rules and to strict regulatory corrections by central banks due to international multilateral conventions",
    "it should be pointed out that in general the range , over which the antipersistency signature , i.e. the power law is valid , occurs over a limited time span in this third category .",
    "in fact , there is a crossover around @xmath88 weeks . for longer time scales ( @xmath89 ) , the signal becomes again persistent or random .",
    "it is also of interest to know whether the lrplc are stable along the data . in order to probe the local strength of the correlations ,",
    "one constructs a so - called observation box of width @xmath90 placed at the beginning of the data , and calculates @xmath3 for the data contained in that box .",
    "then , the box is moved along the data by some step toward the right along the financial sequence and @xmath3 is again calculated .",
    "iterating this procedure one obtains a `` local measurement '' of the degree of `` long - range correlations '' over @xmath90 .",
    "it is crucial to choose the most adequate box size @xmath90 , i.e. to choose @xmath90 of the same order of magnitude as the maximum range @xmath59 over which the above power law is valid .",
    "@xmath3-exponent for @xmath0 and each currency forming the @xmath0 exchange rate with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath3-values are artificially multiplied by two and then displaced along the vertical axis in order to make the fluctuations noticeable . for each time",
    "dependent @xmath3 a horizontal dashed line is drawn to indicate a reference to brownian fluctuations ]    the evolution of the @xmath81 and @xmath91 @xmath3 s for the 1995 - 2000 period is illustrated in fig .",
    "11 . in order to probe the local values of @xmath3 ,",
    "we have used a window of size @xmath92 years .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 varies around 1/2 , i.e. the horizontal dashed line in fig.10 .",
    "the local value of @xmath3 seems to decrease at first and regrows in 95 , is stable in 96 , has a big fluctuation in mid / fall 97 and becomes pretty stable thereafter .",
    "the itl case evolution is slightly different .",
    "the minute differences have probably to be associated to national political or economic events having an impact on the international monetary policy .",
    "it seems interesting to notice that the large fluctuations in @xmath3 occur just before the crash dates of stock market indices .",
    "see also the marked singularity in mid 1999 , a signature of the xr s adjustments prior to the eur introduction . in order to further",
    "_ prove _ this point , a linear dfa analysis of the dow jones industrial stock index around the 1987 october crash was performed @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is found .",
    "other xr time series have been examined in order to check the non - stationarity of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this does support the idea that the foreign currency exchange markets are mainly governed by random conditions @xcite or is said to be _ efficient _ in more usual economic language .",
    "however , this unconditional randomness can not be extrapolated to speculating times nor emerging currencies @xcite .",
    "different universality classes thereby emerge",
    ". it may be useful to recall that hartmann@xcite has examined the competition between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in a more general ( political and economy ) framework .",
    "the dax has been analyzed from the point of view of crashes , in particular the correlations in the signal volatility , before and after the critical days .",
    "the search for the crash day is separated into two numerical problems , that of the index divergence itself and that of the index oscillation frequency acceleration on the other hand . by considering the envelope of the dax",
    ", we have demonstrated that before crashes , a log - periodic pattern exists . even though error bars are intrinsically large , it is surprising to see that a rupture point is easily predicted .",
    "a hierarchical structure close to a fractal percolation backbone ( or tree ) seems intrinsic at crashes .",
    "the stability of this result should be tested in real time for the best future of our economic system . a few foreign exchange currency rates with respect to the @xmath1",
    "have been examined in order to illustrate the dfa technique , the intrinsic structure of the dfa exponent , and its implications with respect to crashes .",
