    "the discovery of the 126 gev higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite has raised an interesting issue about the standard model i.e. if there is no new physics below @xmath10 gev or so , the scalar self coupling of the higgs boson , @xmath11 , when extrapolated by the standard model renormalization group equations , turns negative above this value of mass , primarily due to the large top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "since mass extrapolation is equivalent to extrapolation to large values of the higgs field , this will produce a deeper minimum  @xcite of the higgs potential compared to the usual vacuum that is used to discuss the physics of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this leads to instability of the usual vacuum and will lead to the universe at some time in the future making a transition to the deeper minimum  @xcite .",
    "since the life time for this transition is quite large , one could accept this possibility .",
    "however another direction of physics which may be suggested by this and one that has received great deal of attention in recent months , is that this  near criticality \" of the higgs coupling is a signal of nearby new physics that would stabilize this vacuum .",
    "many extensions of the standard model by enlarging the higgs and/or the gauge sector have been proposed as a way to eliminate the deeper high scale minimum of the potential  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the second point of view and consider an extension of the standard model where quark and charged lepton masses arise from a generalized seesaw mechanism ( we call it universal seesaw here )  @xcite , via the introduction of a new set of tev or higher mass vector - like fermions , that provide the seesaw  counterweight \" .",
    "a natural setting for the universal seesaw is not the standard model but one with an extended gauge sector such as the left - right symmetric model based on the gauge group @xmath12 with parity symmetry  @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking in this model is implemented by two higgs doublets , one , a doublet under @xmath13 and a second one which is a doublet under @xmath14 .",
    "this set up prevents direct yukawa couplings between the left and right chiral sm quarks that lead to  non - seesaw \" type quark masses , thus enabling seesaw to work . as noted above",
    ", the tev scale vector - like fermion masses provide the seesaw counter weight that leads to masses for the sm quarks as well as charged leptons .",
    "there are two options for neutrino masses and we discuss this below .",
    "the left - right seesaw model ( denoted here by slrm ) has the advantage that it has a particularly simple higgs sector i.e. only one extra right handed doublet higgs boson beyond the sm higgs field .",
    "it is therefore different from many multi - higgs extension of sm discussed in the literature .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the model has only two neutral higgs fields , one of which can be identified with the sm higgs field ( the 126 gev higgs boson ) .",
    "this model has the additional advantage that it also provides a solution to the strong cp problem without an axion  @xcite and for low right handed scale ( @xmath15 tev ) , protects  @xcite this solution from possible large planck scale effects  @xcite . because of these properties , this model has received a lot of attention in recent years  @xcite . since the model is based on the gauge group @xmath12 with parity symmetry , the higgs potential of the model has only one extra scalar coupling parameter .",
    "the parity symmetry is assumed to be softly broken by the mass terms of the higgs doublets , so that parity is a technically  natural \" symmetry  @xcite and does not disturb the above property at the tree level . as noted , in the unitary gauge , this model has only two neutral higgs fields and no extra charged higgs fields .",
    "we denote the two higgs self scalar couplings by @xmath0 and analyze the renormalization group evolution of these couplings in order to address the stability of the ground state of the theory that breaks the full gauge symmetry down to @xmath16 .",
    "once a stable vacuum is located , it will solve the vacuum stability problem of sm .",
    "as far as the masses of the heavy vector - like fermions go , in principle , the masses of all but the top partner fermion field could be large but in this paper for simplicity , we consider both the right handed scale and all the vector - like fermion masse to be in the tev range in analyzing the vacuum stability of the model .",
    "this will make the model amenable to experimental tests at the large hadron collider gev .",
    "the tree level potential in this model does not break the standard model gauge group , whereas in our case , as we discuss below , parity is softly broken , so that we get a minimum which breaks sm gauge group as well as the right handed @xmath14 at the tree level .",
    "due to soft parity breaking , left - right symmetry is still  natural \"  @xcite .",
    "also we consider the tev scale parity breaking as well as vector like fermions with tev mass so that the second higgs in our model is observable at the lhc .",
    "our model as well as our discussion of vacuum stability are therefore very different from the model of  @xcite . ] .",
    "main results of our analysis are the following : we find that this simple extension helps to solve the stability problem of sm vacuum and also puts a lower limit on the mass of second neutral higgs boson of the model .",
    "we then impose the requirement that the scalar self couplings do not  blow up \" till the gut scale of @xmath3 gev , which then allows us to deduce an upper bound on the second higgs mass . combining these",
    "we get : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the parity breaking scale .",
    "a second consequence of vacuum stability requirement is that the heavy vector - like top , bottom and @xmath7 partner fermion ( @xmath8 ) masses must have an upper bound , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "we then discuss some aspects of the heavy and light higgs boson phenomenology in the model .",
    "we find an interesting relation between the heavy higgs boson decay modes to @xmath18 that is characteristic of the model and may be used to test it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the basic ingredients of the model including the scalar potential and the neutral higgs masses in the unitary gauge ; in sec .",
    "iii , we present the renormalization group equations for different couplings of the model ; in sec iv , we present the phenomenology of the heavy higgs field including its production at lhc and its decay modes . in sec .",
    "v , we give some comments on the neutrino mass profiles in our model .",
    "we summarize our results in sec . vi .",
    "since this model is a tev scale embedding of sm in the left - right model with quark and charged lepton seesaw  @xcite , the sm fermions plus the right handed neutrinos are assigned to doublets of the left and right handed @xmath19 s according to their chirality as in standard left - right models .",
    "we add four kinds of vector - like fermions @xmath20 , one set per generation , to our model to generate fermion masses is not necessary since the neutrino masses could arise at the loop level  @xcite ; in this case , we will get dirac neutrinos : see later for discussion of this point . ] : @xmath21 in the above equation , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the quark and lepton doublets , respectively , and @xmath24 are color @xmath25 triplets while the remaining fields are singlets .",
    "the scalar field content of the left - right seesaw model  @xcite consists of only of one additional higgs doublet .",
    "they transform under the gauge group @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 the scalar potential in our model is given by : @xmath28     + \\lambda_2 ( \\chi_l^\\dagger \\chi_l ) ( \\chi_r^\\dagger \\chi_r ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that parity symmetry in the above equation is softly broken so that left - right symmetry is natural  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath29 , the full gauge symmetry breaks down to @xmath16 at the minimum of the potential : @xmath30 we obtain the minimization conditions @xmath31 let us note that in ref.@xcite , due to exact left - right symmetry , at the tree level , @xmath32 and one has to invoke radiative corrections to generate this vev , which may naturally explain the smallness of @xmath33 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "this gives additional constraints on the parameters of the model , which we do not have .",
    "also , the tree level soft breaking allows us to keep the right handed scale near a tev making the right handed @xmath34 accessible at the lhc whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath6 scale is much higher which makes both the @xmath34 and the heavy higgs @xmath35 beyond the lhc range . in our model ,",
    "the smallness of @xmath33 compared to @xmath6 is an input and that allows us to keep the right handed scale in the lhc accessible range .",
    "the cp - even higgs mass matrix reads @xmath36 in the limit of @xmath37 , the two mass eigenvalues are , respectively , @xmath38      the yukawa interactions responsible for fermion masses in this model are given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "note that due to the left - right gauge invariance , there is no direct coupling between the left and right handed chiral light quarks as would have been the case for the standard model gauge group with heavy vector - like quarks e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we do not include the @xmath41 couplings and discuss it at the end of the paper separately . in the above equation , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are matrices with complex elements so that theory has cp violation . for simplicity of discussion , we assume all yukawa couplings to be all real and note that our discussion of the higgs sector and vacuum stability is not affected by this .    in the slrm , all the quarks obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism , e.g. for the top sector alone , @xmath45 which leads to generic seesaw type mass relations : @xmath46 most interesting consequence of the seesaw relation is for the top quark .",
    "first of all , the relevant yukawa coupling @xmath47 for top quark can differ from that in sm , depending of @xmath6 and the mass of the heavy @xmath48 fermion .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 , then @xmath47 can be much larger than one .",
    "in addition to making the theory non - perturbative , large values of @xmath47 will also lead to gross instability of the vacuum , the very problem we are addressing .",
    "we therefore analyze carefully the dependence of @xmath47 for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath50 .",
    "since we are exploring tev scale physics , we will keep @xmath6 also in the few tev range . as shown in fig .",
    "[ yt ] , for @xmath6 and @xmath51 in the range of few tev , @xmath47 is generally larger than its corresponding sm value at @xmath6 scale . in combination with rge analysis ,",
    "this helps us to put an upper bound on @xmath47 and hence an upper bound on the top partner mass @xmath50 .",
    "we find that in the entire allowed parameter space of our model , @xmath52 .     as function of @xmath6 and @xmath50 , and",
    "the vertical blue dashed lines are the top quark yukawa coupling in the sm as function of @xmath6 . in making this plot",
    "we have used the top quark mass @xmath53 gev  @xcite .",
    ", width=283 ]    [ yt ]    we now make a brief comment on the quark flavor structure in our model .",
    "let us keep all heavy vector - like fermion masses near the @xmath6 scale .",
    "since the vector - like quark mass matrix can be diagonalized by a choice of basis , all flavor structure resides in the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath54 . by taking the yukawa couplings to be hierarchical",
    ", we can reproduce all the quark masses and the ckm angles .",
    "we now give an example of a simple scenario which gives the desired ckm mixing pattern .",
    "assume the following : ( i ) all the mass parameters for the heavy vector - like quarks @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the same with different values for the up and down sector , ( ii ) the up - type yukawa coupling matrix @xmath57 is diagonal with diagonal elements proportional to square roots of @xmath58 and ( iii ) the down - type yukawa couplings @xmath59 with @xmath60 proportional to the square roots of @xmath61 .",
    "this choice naturally leads to the familiar ckm matrix @xmath62 .",
    "one could of course get other fits to observed quark masses and mixings using other choices for vector like quarks with unequal masses etc .",
    "the bottom line is that due to extra parameters in the theory beyond sm ( e.g. the vector - like quark masses ) , obtaining desired ckm flavor pattern is always possible in our model .",
    "the presence of the vector - like fermions implies that there are small deviations from unitarity of the ckm matrix in the quark sector ; however , the corrections are proportional to ratio of light to heavy quarks and are therefore small . in the simple quark mixing fit , the violation of unitarity",
    "is estimated to be at most of order @xmath63 .",
    "a second point is that there are new flavor changing neutral current effects in the model due to the presence of tev scale singlet quarks .",
    "these have been analyzed in ref .",
    "the resulting constraints on the vector - like quarks are rather weak and imply @xmath64 gev and can be safely ignored . in the lepton sector , the constraints come from processes such as @xmath65 and imply @xmath66 gev .",
    "the weak limits are due to small ratio of muon to heavy vector - like leptons .",
    "the point we want to emphasize is that due to the hierarchical pattern of yukawa couplings , in the rge running of couplings , only the third generation fermions make significant contribution .",
    "also we note that cp violating phases do not effect our discussion and therefore we ignore them below .",
    "in this section , first we present the rge equations below and above the heavy fermion mass @xmath67 and @xmath14 symmetry scale @xmath68 and then we study their implications for vacuum stability . for simplicity ,",
    "both the @xmath67 and @xmath6 are chosen to be very near each other and in the tev range .",
    "we use only one matching scale @xmath6 since by virtue of our assumption , all new particles beyond sm start contributing at this scale to the rges .      below the heavy fermion and right handed scale",
    ", the sm can be viewed as the effective theory of the slrm .",
    "we therefore use the sm @xmath69 functions till @xmath6 as follows  @xcite . note that our @xmath70 gauge coupling is not normalized as in gut theories .",

    "let us discuss both options below .",
    "in the case of the first option , there are two loop diagrams connects the left and right handed chirality neutrino states and lead to a dirac mass for the neutrinos .",
    "it can be estimated to be : @xmath183 this formula gives neutrino masses of order @xmath184 ev for the @xmath185 and a factor of 10 smaller for the muon neutrino mass , which are in of the right order of magnitude . here",

    "the neutrino mass hierarchy in this case is normal .",
    "we do not discuss the lepton mixing patterns for this case in this paper .",

    "note that both type of mass terms for the @xmath41 field are gauge invariant since @xmath191 is a gauge singlet field .",
    "if we have only dirac masses @xmath192 for the vector - like neutral fermions ( in a manner similar to the charged fermions ) , small neutrino masses will require very large @xmath193 gev for @xmath194 or very small yukawa couplings ( @xmath195 ) for @xmath196 .",
    "the theory will then have exact lepton number conservation .",
    "we do not address the question of neutrino mixings since by arranging an appropriate flavor structure for the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath197 s , one can always get the desired pattern .    coming to the case with both dirac and majorana masses for the @xmath41 ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in this case reads , in the basis of ( @xmath198 , @xmath41 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 ) ( where all fields are left handed ) , @xmath201 in the parameter regime where @xmath202 , the light left handed neutrino masses are given by @xmath203 . for @xmath204 ,",
    "the formulae are roughly @xmath205 and for right handed neutrinos ( @xmath206 s ) , replace @xmath207 in the above formulae .",
    "naively one might think that in the majorana alternative , the right handed neutrino masses will be @xmath208 times those of the left - handed neutrinos ( roughly 100 times larger ) . however this is true only if parity symmetry is exact .",
    "if we take the the majorana mass terms for @xmath209 to be different and therefore break parity softly , they could have very different forms i.e.mass scales as well as textures .",
    "therefore by adjusting these terms , one can make the right handed @xmath210 mass terms in the 10 - 100 gev range , and keep them in conformity with cosmology and low energy weak constraints . as an example , consider the case where the magnitudes of all elements of @xmath211 are in the range of @xmath10 gev and those of @xmath212 are in the tev range , in this case , the light `` left - handed '' neutrinos can have sub - ev masses as observed with right handed neutrino masses being in the 100 gev range .",
    "since the neutrinos in this case are majorana fermions , they would give rise to neutrino - less double beta decay . in this case the collider phenomenology is similar to the conventional tev scale left - right seesaw case  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is simply to demonstrate that getting small neutrino masses does not pose any challenge to the viability of these models .",
    "we postpone further discussion of neutrino masses and accompanying phenomenology to a future publication .",
    "we also do not explore the question of whether three singlet fermions @xmath41 are essential , since this is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "we also wish to comment that we have checked the effect of the neutrino couplings on the vacuum stability question . for @xmath213 that we assume",
    "the running effects are small and in fact their contribution is even less for higher values for @xmath190 since their contributions to rges start only at high scales .",
    "we have discussed the question of vacuum stability in the left - right seesaw embedding of standard model with universal seesaw implemented by tev scale vector - like fermions .",
    "this model has only one extra scalar higgs coupling beyond the standard model and it helps to stabilize the electroweak vacuum till gut scale .",
    "this model has only two neutral higgs bosons .",
    "identifying the lighter of them with the 126 higgs boson of standard model , the heavy higgs mass is found to be below the @xmath6 scale . for parity breaking scale in the few tev range , it can be accessible at the lhc .",
    "we discuss its collider phenomenology such as production cross section and decay properties .",
    "we also find that the vector - like top , bottom and @xmath7 partners @xmath8 are below @xmath6 making them lhc accessible .",
    "we also find an interesting relation between the three heavy higgs boson decay modes : @xmath214 , which can provide a test of this model once the heavy higgs boson is discovered .",
