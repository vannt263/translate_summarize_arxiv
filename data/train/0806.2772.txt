    "although the setting of hyperbolic geometry for relativity in general  @xcite , and special relativity in particular  @xcite , is not new , what is new are the physical predictions which can be drawn from it .",
    "fock  @xcite showed that friedmann s  @xcite solution to einstein s equation , corresponding to a uniform mass density at zero pressure , can be formulated in lobachevsky s velocity space , which has become known as rapidity  space  @xcite .",
    "the angular defect concerns both aberration and parallax , although the two phenomena are quite distinct from one another  @xcite . in fact , bradley discovered aberration in 1728 while looking for parallax .",
    "although both phenomena cause the locus of a star to trace out an ellipse , the direction and magnitude of the angular deviation is quite different from that caused by parallax .",
    "the crucial difference is that the magnitude of deviation caused by aberration is independent of the distance to the star , and is much greater than for parallax .",
    "it is known that the angle of parallax is greater than the defect  @xcite , and , moreover , the angle of parallax is greater than the complementary angle of parallelism , which is a sole function of distance . in the klein model , we will appreciate that the angle of parallelism is a limiting angle , while the angular defect is always present .",
    "it has also been shown that the angular defect of a hyperbolic triangle is related to the upper bound on the euclidean ( @xmath1- ) measure of relativistic velocities using the poincar disc model which is conformal  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the klein model is used , which is not conformal , one would find lorentz contraction in the direction normal to the motion  @xcite .",
    "the angular defect in the hyperbolic triangle , which is proportional to the area , has also been implicated in the determination of the rotation of axes in successive lorentz transformations in different planes  @xcite .",
    "it came as a curious surprise that successive lorentz transforms , or boosts  as they are now referred to , is not another boost , but involves a rotation . in physics ,",
    "the angle of rotation is known as wigner s angle  @xcite , and is the kinematic factor underlying thomas precession .",

    "expression can also be derived by differentiating the lorentz transformations at constant , relative velocity  @xcite .",

    "it is the second term in the numerator of that is related to the thomas precession : the rotation of the electron s velocity vector  @xcite , @xmath9 caused by the acceleration , @xmath10 , in time , @xmath6 .",
    "then , as the velocity turns by @xmath11 along the orbit , the spin projection turns in the opposite direction by an amount equal to the angular defect of the hyperbolic triangle whose vertices are the velocities in three different inertial frames in pure translation with respect to one another .",
    "the defect caused by aberration can be readily calculated .",
    "consider the triangle formed by three vertices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in velocity space . by setting @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unit normal in the direction of the light source",
    ", we are considering an ideal , or improper ,  triangle  @xcite , which shares many properties of ordinary triangles , but has the property that the sum of its angles is less than two - right angles , its so - called defect .",
    "consequently , there will be two parallel lines forming an ideal vertex @xmath14 , whose angle is zero so that @xmath17 .",
    "the cosines of the angles are given by the inner products  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 $ ] , and a similar expression for @xmath20 .",
    "all three angles can be calculated by permuting cyclically the indices , and it is easy to see that @xmath21 . by choosing a frame where the velocities are equal and opposite in direction , @xmath22 , we are , in fact , considering a two - way  doppler shift .",
    "the relative velocity is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the projection of the velocity on the normal to the wavefront is : @xmath26    the cosine law for angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be written as : @xmath29 on account of , the cosine of the first angle is : @xmath30 this represents the usual formula for aberration , except for the negative sign which implies reflection and guaranteeing that the angle of parallelism is acute .",
    "the second equation of aberration for the first angle is : @xmath31 the ratio of the wavelengths , @xmath32 is doppler s principle . for the second angle we have : @xmath33 again on account of , and ,",
    "hence , @xmath34 finally , by , we find the relation : @xmath35 between the two cosines , where @xmath36 is the relative speed given by .",
    "the aberration formula has the identical form of the law of reflection for a moving mirror  @xcite . for a stationary mirror , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the angles are subtended by the incoming and outgoing rays , and the surface of the mirror .",
    "however , it must be borne in mind that the angles are at the vertices in velocity space so that an angle of @xmath39 is parallel to the wavefront , or perpendicular to the motion .",
    "the first , and , and second , and , pair of aberration equations can be combined to read :    @xmath40    respectively .",

    "two important cases arise :",
    "( i ) when the vertices , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of the ideal triangle are on the same limiting curve , called a horocycle , @xmath41 , whose center is at infinity , @xmath42 , shown in fig . 1 , and ( ii ) when the transversal is perpendicular to one of the parallel lines , shown in fig",
    ". 2 .            in the first case",
    ", @xmath39 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , the angle of parallelism , is given by : @xmath45 @xmath44 is only a function of the _ half _ distance  @xmath46 . from and we find @xmath47 , which is the @xmath0-measure of distance in velocity space .    in the second case ,",
    "one of the angles is @xmath48 , and the other is necessarily acute , being the angle of parallelism . in other words , lines with a common",
    "perpendicular can not be parallel so that @xmath44 must be acute .",
    "it is readily seen from that @xmath28 can not become a right - angle because that would imply @xmath49 , and so violate .",
    "@xmath50 is the @xmath1-measure of length , which is equal to the hyperbolic tangent of its @xmath0-measure [ cf .",
    "eqn below ] .",
    "negative values are ruled out in hyperbolic geometry : the hyperbolic tangent is a function that assumes all values between @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite . in other words , the angle of parallelism must be an acute angle , for , otherwise , the lines would be divergent .",
    "the formation of an ideal triangle is related to the fact that @xmath53 is the limiting speed .",
    "we will return to this point when discussing terrell s invisibility of the lorentz contraction .",
    "rather , if @xmath54 , and is introduced into , we get : @xmath55 where the angle of parallelism , @xmath44 , is a function of the _ whole _ distance  @xmath56 . from",
    "we find the new @xmath0-measure of distance as @xmath57 , which again related to the hyperbolic tangent through below .",
    "in contrast to , the @xmath0-measure has become twice as great in .",
    "this , as we shall see , is the same as performing a two - way  doppler shift .",
    "the defect , @xmath58 , is expressed in terms of the relative speed @xmath50 and the angle @xmath59 subtended by the direction of the light source and the line of sight of the observer , i.e. ,  @xcite : @xmath60    in thomas procession , the velocity turns along the orbit by an amount @xmath59 , while the spin projection in the orbital plane turns in the opposite direction by the amount @xmath61 , the @xmath0-defect  @xcite . under the same conditions as above",
    ", the angular defect has been found to be related to the rotation of the velocity vector by : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is not the lorentz factor , as usually assumed  @xcite , but , rather is  @xcite : @xmath64 for small defects where the circular functions on the left - hand sides of and can be approximated by their arguments , the proportionality factor to the sine of the angle of rotation of the velocity vector in is the _ square _ of @xmath65 in .",
    "this tends to imply that a two - step  process is involved where the doppler shifts in and are squared [ cf .",

    "( 116 ) , they identify @xmath69 with @xmath3 .",
    "their eqn ( 67 ) is an identity by identifying @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath36 with @xmath63 , and their @xmath50 with @xmath36 .",
    "however , their eqn ( 120 ) does not follow from eqn ( 119 ) . ]    moreover , either expression , or , shows that the turning of the spin is kinematical in origin , and not relativistic as it would be if @xmath63 were the one - way  lorentz factor , @xmath72 , since @xmath73 in the low velocity region  @xcite . any time a component of the acceleration exists normal to the velocity , for whatever reason , then there is a thomas precession , independent of other effects  @xcite  including relativistic ones .",
    "this kinematical effect is due to the compounding of doppler shifts , and will be a recurrent theme throughout this paper .",
    "the fundamental connection between hyperbolic geometry and optical phenomena in general , and relativity in particular , is that the longitudinal doppler shift is related to the exponential distance of the klein model in velocity space  @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic length is defined through the cross - ratio ; the cross - ratio is a projective invariant of four points .",
    "this is the smallest number of points that is invariant , since three points on a line may be projected to any other three . whereas the klein disc is not conformal , except at the origin of the hyperbolic plane , the poincar disc is .",
    "the disc models also differ in how @xmath0-distance is measured : the @xmath0-distance is twice as great in the poincar disc than it is in the klein disc .",
    "the factor two is not just a mere numerical factor , since it is indicative of reflections and the way velocities are compounded and distances measured .",
    "moreover , it will change the dependencies of energy , momentum , and consequently , mass , on the relative speed .",
    "another possibility of vindicating hyperbolic geometry consists in the distinction between aberration and the pressure of radiation against a moving mirror .",
    "early in the development of special relativity , the lorentz transform and its inverse were used to determine the pressure of radiation on a moving mirror  @xcite .",
    "it is still common to use aberration to determine the radiation pressure , even though einstein calculated the difference in the energy density _ after _ being reflected from the mirror and the initial energy density in order to determine the radiation pressure .",
    "a two - way  doppler shift is involved , and not a one - way doppler shift  @xcite .",
    "this we will show to be the same distinction between the klein and the poincar models of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that the second - order doppler effect predicted by the two - way doppler shift is an experimental test for the angle of parallelism .",
    "the relativistic velocity addition law for two systems moving at equal and opposite speeds , , is the isomorphism from the klein model of hyperbolic geometry onto the poincar disc and upper half - plane models  @xcite . in the poincar disc model , points of the hyperbolic plane",
    "are represented by points interior to an @xmath1-circle , @xmath63 .",
    "lines , not passing through the center of the circle , are represented by open arcs of circles which cut a fixed circle , @xmath63 , orthogonally at @xmath74 and @xmath75 in fig .",
    "3 . the only straight lines pass through the center , which are also orthogonal to the unit circle , called the circle at infinity , or the horizon .",
    "not only did beltrami discover the poincar disc model , some fourteen years before poincar rediscovered it  @xcite , he also constructed the klein , or projective model , by projecting a hemisphere vertically downwards onto the complex plane .",
    "although the projection of a small circle on the hemisphere becomes an ellipse on the disc , so that the klein model is not conformal , the redeeming virtue of the model is that the vertical sections of the hemisphere are projected into @xmath1-straight lines as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath0-lines of the klein model are @xmath1-chords of the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are _ ordinary _ points inside @xmath63 , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the ends of the chord through @xmath76 and @xmath77 , klein s definition of the length of the segment is : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the invariant cross - ratio .",
    "the overbar represents @xmath1-length , and we will use it to distinguish from the @xmath0-length when confusion can arise .",
    "poincar , on the other hand , determines the distance of the arc from @xmath76 to @xmath77 as twice klein s distance , viz .",
    ", @xmath80    let the ends of the chords @xmath74 and @xmath75 be @xmath52 and @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 and @xmath83 have coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 then the cross - ratio is :",
    "@xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 , it follows that @xmath89 since @xmath90 hence , @xmath36 given by , is an isomorphism that makes the lengths of the klein and poincar models to coincide .",
    "having derived the formulas for aberration in the first section , we now consider , in greater detail , the limiting forms and which are the bolyai - lobachevsky formulas for the angle of parallelism .",
    "although there has been no mention of hyperbolic geometry , this situation has been widely discussed in the literature ,  @xcite , and without the connection to an angle of parallelism .    for @xmath91 ,",
    "the observer in a frame in which the object is at rest will see the object rotated by an amount @xmath92 , just equal to the lorentz contraction .",
    "the angle of parallelism , @xmath93 provides the link between circular and hyperbolic functions . only at the angle of parallelism",
    "can a rotation be equated with a lorentz contraction .",
    "terrell  @xcite also considers the opposite case where @xmath39 and @xmath94 .",
    "he concludes that to the stationary observer , the object appears to be rotating about its line of motion in such a way as to appear broadside at @xmath94 , and to present a view of its rear end from that time on .",
    "however , the stationary observer will not see any motion of this sort performed by the moving object because the angle of parallelism , linking circular and ( positive ) hyperbolic functions , must be acute ; otherwise , the @xmath0-measure of distance would turn out to be negative !",
    "therefore , terrell s  @xcite analysis can not be extended to angles of parallelism greater than @xmath48 , for such angles do not exist .",
    "in other words , the observer must make his observation of the object in the same inertial frame of the object , and the condition @xmath95 makes @xmath59 an angle of parallelism via the equation of aberration , , or .",
    "this is to be contrasted by a comment made by variak  @xcite which provoked einstein s response  @xcite :     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the question of whether the lorentz contraction is real or not is misleading .",

    "it has the same form as , since the latter can be expressed as : @xmath174the fact that the wavelength at which the radiation is absorbed is greater than that at which it is emitted by the source , i.e. @xmath175 , means that less energy is absorbed than was emitted .",
    "this is true also for the two - way shift .",
    "the factor of @xmath67 has led to the confusion of whether to consider the radiation pressure reflected by a moving mirror as being a one- or two - way doppler shift , or equivalently , as belonging to the klein or poincar model of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "consider a circle of unit radius in velocity space @xmath176 .",
    "it is also a hyperbolic circle with center @xmath177 and some hyperbolic radius @xmath50 whose value is .",
    "this defines the distance  @xmath56 in terms of the logarithm of the cross - ratio .",
    "now consider the right triangle that has an angle @xmath59 at the origin , as shown in fig .",
    "5 .        since the angle @xmath59",
    "is located at the origin , the @xmath0-measure of @xmath59 will be the same as its @xmath1-measure .",
    "recalling that hyperbolic tangents correspond to straight lines in lobachevsky space , the cosine of the angle will be the ratio of the adjacent to the hypotenuse , @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the @xmath1-measure of the angle , and we have set the absolute constant equal to one .",
    "we must now put a bar over @xmath50 to distinguish it from its @xmath0-measure @xmath50 .",
    "now , the @xmath1-length of the opposite side , @xmath180 , can be calculated from the cross - ratio , and what is found is  @xcite : @xmath181 this is the origin of the lorentz contraction in the direction normal to the motion  @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath180 is shortened by the amount @xmath182 from its @xmath0-measure @xmath183 had it been located at the origin .",
    "this also responsible for the angle defect .    in the projective model",
    ", the @xmath0-measures of all other angles will be different than their @xmath1-counterparts .",
    "for the angle @xmath184 we have : @xmath185 since the last term is less than unity @xmath186 .",
    "but since cosine is a decreasing function over the open interval @xmath187 , it follows that @xmath188 , so that if the @xmath1-sum of angles of a triangle is @xmath189 , its @xmath0-sum will be less than @xmath189 .",
    "thus , the angular defect is what is responsible for the lorentz contraction in the direction normal to the motion  @xcite .",
    "now , the largest value of @xmath190 occurs when it reaches the chord @xmath191 .",
    "its @xmath0-measure becomes infinite , and the angle @xmath184 tends to zero for @xmath192 .",
    "however , the @xmath1-measure of @xmath190 is : @xmath193 only at the angle of parallelism can rotation be linked to @xmath0-contraction , and this is precisely what happens at @xmath194 .    since the @xmath1-measure of the hypotenuse , @xmath195 , gives : @xmath196 where @xmath59 is the angle of parallelism , which is a function of ( half ) the length @xmath197 , and @xmath198 in fig .",
    "we recall that expression is what terrell  @xcite finds for the rotation of an object that an observer will see in the same frame as the moving object when the stationary observer s view is in the direction normal to the motion . and since this is a limiting form of aberration it does not depend upon the distance between the observer and the object that is being observed .    for a one - way shift ,",
    "the radiation pressure vanishes at the critical angle @xmath194 , whereas for a two - way shift vanishes at its critical angle , @xmath199 . at these critical angles ,",
    "the waves have ceased to press against the mirror , and , consequently , the radiation pressure vanishes .",
    "this is what the klein disc predicts .",
    "now , let us see what the poincar disc has to say about two - way doppler shifts .",
    "since the model is conformal there is no need to distinguish between @xmath1- and @xmath0-measures of the angles .",
    "consider the @xmath0-arc length , @xmath36 , from @xmath76 to @xmath77 in the poincar half - plane , in fig .",
    "6 , of a semi - circle of radius @xmath52 .",
    "its length is determined by the logarithm of the cross - ratio @xmath200 , where the primes denote the projections of @xmath76 and @xmath77 onto the @xmath84-axis .",
    "using the klein definition of @xmath0-distance , , we have : @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "hence , the @xmath1-length of @xmath36 is : @xmath204 and when @xmath36 becomes the @xmath0-length @xmath205 , @xmath206 , reduces to [ cf .",
    "eqn ] : @xmath207 now , since @xmath208 we , in effect , are dealing with poincar s definition of @xmath0-distance [ cf .",
    "thus , @xmath59 becomes the angle of parallelism , which is a function solely of the arc length , @xmath157 .",
    "this is so because @xmath209 is perpendicular to the line @xmath210 whose bounding parallel through @xmath77 is @xmath211 .",
    "hence , the angle between @xmath209 and @xmath211 is also equal to @xmath59 .",
    "the one - way doppler shift , , predicts a small blue - shift  when @xmath39 , @xmath212ives and stilwell  @xcite were the first to test time dilatation by measuring the difference in the doppler shift of spectral lines emitted in the forward and backward directions by a uniformly moving beam of hydrogen atoms .    it might be more advantageous to consider the two - way doppler shift , where gives the frequency shift : @xmath213 the two - way aberration formula , @xmath214 together with lead immediately to the law of sines , , for a moving mirror , which , as we have point out , also happens to be the formula for aberration .",
    "the two - way doppler shift , , like its one - way counterpart , , predicts a red - shift  as either the transmitter or receiver recede from the other .",
    "however , for @xmath39 , a blue - shift would remain .",
    "the shifted frequency would be @xmath215 in this limit , reduces to the angle of parallelism : @xmath216 which follows from .",
    "the angle @xmath217 is , indeed , acute , and @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , a second - order shift predicted by would be a direct confirmation that relativity operates in hyperbolic velocity space . at the present time ,",
    "the experimental evidence is not conclusive .",
    "light pulses reflected from a rotating mirror have not shown relativistic frequency shifts  @xcite , nor have those from dual disks rotating at equal speeds in opposite directions operating in the microwave region  @xcite . however , a positive result has been reported by measuring the mssbauer effect with source and absorber mounted on a rotating disk  @xcite .",
    "the null results can possibly be explained by a confusion between one - way and two - way doppler shifts . in  @xcite , the one - way , , and two - way , , shifts were placed on equal footing because both predict a frequency shift proportional to @xmath219 .",
    "hence , it is not clear to experimenters what they should be looking for is a two - way , second - order doppler shift , and not a first - order one .",
