    "recently , a new type of millisecond radio burst transients , named fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , has attracted wide attention @xcite . due to limited data , especially the lack of distance measurements ,",
    "their physical origin is subject to intense debate . in the literature ,",
    "18 frbs have been reported up to now , and their observed event rate is predicted to be @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "most of these bursts are located at high galactic latitudes and have anomalously large dispersion measures ( dm ) , which strongly suggest that they are of an extragalactic or even cosmological origin .",
    "attributing dm to an intergalactic medium origin , the corresponding redshifts @xmath11 are around 0.5 - 1 . the isotropic total energy released in a frb is @xmath12 erg , and the peak radio luminosity is @xmath13 erg @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed to account for frbs .",
    "these include non - catastrophic events such as magnetar giant flares @xcite , giant pulses of young pulsars @xcite , galactic flaring stars @xcite , asteroid collisions with neutron stars @xcite , and catastrophic events such as blitzars @xcite , neutron star mergers @xcite , white dwarf mergers @xcite , charged black hole mergers @xcite , etc .    considering the dramatic observational event rate , once their cosmological origin could be confirmed , frbs have great potential to become a powerful cosmological probe . for instance , they could be used to identify missing baryons @xcite , infer the baryon content and reionization history of the universe @xcite , constrain cosmological parameters and the dark matter equation of state @xcite , conduct fundamental tests of einstein s weak equivalent principle @xcite , and even set a stringent upper limit on the mass of photons @xcite .",
    "some interesting observational features have been collected recently for individual frbs .",
    "frb 140514 was the first real - time frb detection and the first with polarization information , i.e. a @xmath15 circular polarization on the leading edge and a @xmath16 upper limit ( @xmath17 ) on linear polarization .",
    "later , an examination of archival data revealed faraday rotation in frb 110523 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 linear polarization of frb 110523 enabled the first simultaneous measurements of both its dispersion measure and rotation measure @xcite .",
    "frb 121002 was reported to exhibit a double - peaked profile , with two peaks separated by 5ms @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detections of 10 additional bright bursts from frb 121102 at 1.4 ghz at the arecibo observatory , making frb 121102 the first and the only one so far with repeating features .",
    "@xcite claimed to find a bright radio fading transient following frb 150418 , which lasted for about 6 days .",
    "a putative host galaxy with redshift @xmath19 was identified .",
    "however , subsequent observations suggested that the counterpart radio transient is more likely attributed to agn variability instead of an afterglow of frb 150418 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that a small fraction of frbs could be associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) was proposed by @xcite .",
    "most recently , a @xmath0-ray transient , swift j0644.5 - 5111 , was claimed to be associated with frb 131104 both spatially and temporarily @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluence of the transient is 10 order of magnitude larger than the fluence of frb 131104 , and the total @xmath0-ray energy output is @xmath20erg at the nominal redshift @xmath21 inferred from the dispersion measure of frb 131104 @xcite if one assumes that the host galaxy dm is @xmath22 , which corresponds to a @xmath0-ray energy of @xmath23 . ] .",
    "x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical observations starting from two days after the frb did not reveal any associated afterglow . @xcite discussed the general implications of bright @xmath0-ray counterpart to the frb , and suggested that , largely independent of the source model , a radio afterglow is expected for such frb / grb systems .",
    "soon after , @xcite reported their radio imaging follow - up observations of the original localization region of the frb , beginning from three days after the event and comprising 25 epochs over 2.5  yr .",
    "they reported a coincident agn flare similar to the radio transient observed in the error box of frb 131104 ( but with a smaller amplitude ) , but no radio afterglow was detected within the swift j0644.5 - 5111 error circle .",
    "an upper limit of 70 @xmath24 and 100 @xmath24 were placed on the radio afterglow emission of frb / grb system at 5.5 ghz and 7.5 ghz , respectively .    here",
    "we present a comprehensive discussion for the physical implications of the null detection of radio afterglow for frb 131104/swift j0644.5 - 5111 . throughout the paper , the convention @xmath25 is adopted in cgs units .",
    "frb 131104 is a real - time discovery detected in a targeted observation of the milky way satellite car dsph ( with galactic latitude @xmath26 ) by the parkes radio telescope @xcite .",
    "the event was detected at 18:04:01.2 on ut",
    "2013  november  4 ( mjd  56600 ) , in beam 5 of the mb receiver , which at the time was pointed at the celestial coordinates ( j2000 ) 06h44m10.4s , @xmath2751d16m40s .",
    "the dm of the burst is 779@xmath28pc , which exceeds the prediction for the maximum line - of - sight galactic contribution by a factor of 11 .",
    "the redshift of frb 131104 inferred from its dm value is @xmath29 .",

    "the transient has a duration @xmath34s .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluence of the transient is @xmath35 , about 10 orders of magnitude larger than the fluence of frb 131104 , @xmath36 @xcite . with the inferred redshift @xmath29 ,",

    "any frb may leave behind an afterglow , the brightness of which depends on the radio emission efficiency @xcite . the lower the efficiency , the brighter the afterglow .",
    "if swift j0644.5 - 5111 is associated with the frb , such an efficiency is settled ( @xmath37 ) , which suggests a bright cosmic fireball .",
    "the absolute energy of the fireball depends on the distance to the source . for the nominal distance @xmath38 , the total isotropic energy falls into the range of both long and short grbs . assuming a relativistic fireball similar to cosmological grbs",
    ", the deceleration of the fireball would power a radio afterglow that may be detectable @xcite .",
    "assuming that a power - law spectrum of the accelerated electrons is a power law function with the index of @xmath39 , and that a constant fraction @xmath7 of the shock energy is distributed to electrons , the minimum injected electron lorentz factor could be estimated as ( for @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is proton mass and electron mass respectively .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the observational flux is essentially determined by 5 parameters : the redshift of the source @xmath11 ( which would define the blastwave energy @xmath85 if one assumes that @xmath85 is comparable to the @xmath0-ray energy @xmath86 , which can be derived from the @xmath0-ray fluence ) , the ambient medium particle number density @xmath87 , the shock microphysics parameters including @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and the electron spectral index @xmath39 .",

    "the radio afterglow detection rate of swift grbs is about 30% @xcite . since swift j0644.5 - 5111",
    "is a sub - threshold swift grb , the non - detection of a radio afterglow is not particularly surprising . on the other hand ,",
    "the 70 @xmath24 and 100 @xmath24 upper limits are deeper than most grb radio afterglow upper limits ( fig.5 of @xcite ) which compensates the low fluence of swift j0644.5 - 5111 compared with the majority of swift grbs . in any case",
    ", the upper limit can pose interesting constraints on the model parameters , e.g. the ambient number density @xmath87 if one takes the nominal redshift @xmath92 , or the redshift @xmath11 if one takes a typical ism density @xmath93 .",
    "we first adopt a set of typical values for the microphysics shock parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath39 ) , and then evaluate the excluded region by the upper limit in the 2-dimensional @xmath94 parameter space , with @xmath11 ranging from 0.001 to 0.90 , and @xmath87 ranging from @xmath95 to @xmath96 . for each pair of @xmath11 and @xmath87 ,",

    "one can require the observational upper flux is higher than @xmath99 at @xmath97 to constrain parameters in the @xmath100 plane . for @xmath101 , the radio afterglow would be still rising at 3 days , and one should require @xmath102 to be below the observational upper limit to constrain parameters .",
    "the rejected parameter spaces in the @xmath100 plane for different values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 are presented . to achieve the most conservative constraints , we use 70 @xmath103jy at 5.5 ghz to constrain the parameters .    for the commonly used microphysics shock parameters ( e.g. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , red curve in fig.1 ) , the radio upper limit for frb 131104/swift j0644.5 - 5111 system could indeed place stringent constraints on the source related parameters @xmath11 and @xmath87 .",
    "the near - flat segment at @xmath104 corresponds to the @xmath101 regime , and the curved segment at @xmath105 corresponds to the @xmath106 regime .",
    "one can see that if the redshift value is of the order of the one inferred from the dm value ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) , the ambient medium number density should be below @xmath108 .",
    "this disfavors the long grb models that invoke a massive star origin of the grb , but is consistent with that inferred from short grb observations and the theoretical expectations for a compact binary merger environment @xcite . on the other hand , if one believes that the frb ambient density is that of a typical ism ( @xmath109 ) , then a very small redshift is required , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "this requires that the observed dm is mostly contributed from the host galaxy or the immediate environment near the frb source instead of the inter - galactic medium .",
    "if this is the case , one should be cautious to apply frbs as cosmological probes .",
    "besides radio data , the follow - up observations of swift and vlt also provide x - ray and optical upper limits on the afterglow of frb 131104/swift j0644.5 - 5111 , i.e. @xmath110 in the x - ray band and 4.5 @xmath24 in the optical band @xcite .",
    "the constraints from the x - rays are more stringent , which we also plot as dotted red curve in fig.1 .",
    "we find that the constraint on the ambient density is mainly contributed by the radio upper limit at lower redshifts , but the x - ray upper limit places a more stringent constraint in the nominal redshift range inferred by dm .",
    "for example , at @xmath111 the constraint on density placed by x - rays is up to a factor of 2 more stringent than that placed by the radio data ( fig.1 ) . @xcite and @xcite reached a similar conclusion independently .    in view of the wide range of microphysics parameters observed in grb afterglows",
    ", we also test how they impact on the results . for @xmath39",
    ", we test three different values , 2.3 , 2.7 , 3 , and find that the results are barely affected .",
    "however , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 have significant effects on the constraints . fixing @xmath1 ( fig.1 left panel ) , the excluded region greatly shrinks as @xmath6 drops .",
    "a long grb environment is allowed if @xmath6 is as low as @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , fixing @xmath2 , the allowed region is also greatly enlarged if @xmath7 is as small as 0.01 .",
    "we have investigated the implications of the upper limit of the radio afterglow of frb 131104/swift j0644.5 - 5111 system reported by @xcite .",
    "we find that for the nominal redshift values inferred from dm and for typical shock microphysics parameters , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , a long grb environment is disfavored but a low - density medium @xmath115 typical for short grbs of a compact star merger origin is allowed . @xcite and @xcite also discussed the constraints on the ambient medium from radio and x - ray / optical data , respectively , and similar conclusions have been obtained .",
    "if one invokes a typical ism medium density , then the distance of the frb is much closer , i.e. @xmath5 , which requires that the large dm is mostly contributed from the frb host or the immediate environment of the frb . on the other hand ,",
    "if one allows @xmath7 and @xmath6 to be smaller values , as inferred in some grb afterglows , the constraints from the upper limit become very loose , so that both long grb and short grb environments can be allowed .",
    "given the loose constraint from the radio afterglow upper limit , the potential frb 131104/swift j0644.5 - 5111 association proposed by @xcite remains plausible .",
    "the relative timing of the frb and the grb is , however , not easy to interpret within the available models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the supra - massive magnetar collapsing model",
    ", the expected frb would be at the end of the plateau @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observation , which shows an extended long grb following the frb .",
    "alternatively , one may attribute the frb to the result of a ns - ns merger , either via synchronization of the magnetosphere @xcite or pre - merger electromagnetic activity due to a charged member @xcite or the unipolar effect @xcite .",
    "however , such a merger would produce a short grb rather than a long one .",
    "one possible solution is to invoke an off - axis geometry for a ns - ns merger system , with the line - of - sight in the so - called free zone where no dynamical ejecta blocks the line of sight ( so that the frb can reach the observer ) , but the short grb jet is missed @xcite .",
    "since nss are naturally charged , the ns - ns merger may produce an frb via the mechanism outlined in @xcite .",
    "the merger leaves behind a stable magnetar with a spin down time scale of the order of @xmath116 s , during which the dissipation of the magnetar wind powers the observed long grb .",
    "the luminosity and total energy of the long grb are consistent with having such a magnetar as the central engine . in any case",
    ", the frb / grb associations should be rare .",
    "future observations of more frb / grb coincident events would allow one to confirm frb / grb associations and to test the physical models of these associations .",
