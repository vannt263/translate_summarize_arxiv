    "the high - acceptance dielectron spectrometer ( hades ) experiment at gsi pursues a comprehensive program of dielectron emission studies in few - gevnucleon - nucleon @xcite , proton - nucleus @xcite , and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "dilepton spectroscopy allows to investigate the properties of hadrons produced , propagated , and decayed in a strongly interacting medium .",
    "this is because leptons ( electrons and muons ) do not themselves interact strongly when traveling through finite - sized hadronic matter , that is , their kinematics remain basically undistorted .",
    "lepton - pair measurements are hence ideally suited to search for medium modifications of hadrons in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the observed dilepton spectra consist , however , of a complex superposition of various mesonic and baryonic contributions , and their interpretation requires a detailed knowledge of all sources .",
    "indeed , early interpretations of dilepton spectra from relativistic heavy - ion collisions commonly introduced a schematic distinction of ( i ) hard initial contributions related to drell - yan type processes , ( ii ) the thermal radiation off the fireball , and ( iii ) the hadronic cocktail from late decays following its disassembly ( cf .",
    "transport models supersede this artificial separation as they describe all phases of the collision on an equal footing by following continuously virtual and real photon emission over time .",
    "presently , they are commonly employed in the few - gev  bombarding energy regime to describe particle production and propagation through the medium , in particular , when dealing with the complex dynamics of nucleus - nucleus reactions @xcite .",
    "comprehensive information on meson production is thereby mandatory to benchmark and constrain those calculations . in this context",
    "the neutral pion and eta mesons are of particular interest as they contribute largely to the dilepton spectrum via their dalitz decays , @xmath5@xmath6and @xmath7@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "although in the few - gev  energy regime a large body of systematic data on pion and , to a lesser extent , on eta production in nucleus - nucleus collisions has been gathered over the last decades , mostly at the bevalac , the ags , and sis18 accelerators , there is much less information available from proton - nucleus reactions .",
    "the latter ones are , however , important as an intermediate step between nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "charged pions from p+a have been measured at the bevalac with proton beams of kinetic energies up to 2.1  gev  @xcite , at triumf up to 0.5  gev  @xcite , and recently by the harp experiment at the cern ps with proton energies between 2  and 12  gev  @xcite .",
    "information on eta production in p+a reactions is even more scarce .",
    "only the pinot experiment at the saturne accelerator in saclay provided data for proton energies in the range of 0.8  1.5  gev  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we supplement the available body of experimental results on pion ( @xmath8 ) and eta production in p+a collisions with data obtained with hades in the p+nb reaction at 3.5  gev .",
    "negative pions have been identified via their characteristic energy loss vs. momentum signature in the hades time - of - flight ( tof ) system .",
    "the neutral mesons , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , were reconstructed with the photon - conversion technique in which meson decay photons are detected via their external conversion into an @xmath6  pair via a bethe - heitler process , preferentially in high-@xmath9 materials .",
    "this method has been developed foremost in high - energy physics experiments @xcite to study the radiative decays of the quarkonium states @xmath10 into @xmath11 and @xmath12 into @xmath13 .",
    "it has also been used in high - energy heavy - ion reactions , namely by the experiment at rhic , studying au+au collisions at a nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy of @xmath14  gev  @xcite and by the experiment at the lhc in @xmath15  tev  p+p collisions @xcite . making use of the good momentum resolution of charged - particle trackers , in particular at low energies , the conversion technique offers typically better energy resolution than a photon calorimeter .",

    "a preliminary version of the @xmath16 data shown here has already been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the six - sector high - acceptance spectrometer hades operates at the gsi helmholtzzentrum fr schwerionenforschung in darmstadt where it takes beams from the heavy - ion synchrotron sis18 .",
    "although its setup was originally optimized for dielectron spectroscopy , hades is in fact a versatile charged - particle detector with both good efficiency and momentum resolution .",
    "its main component serving for electron and positron selection is a hadron - blind ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) .",
    "further particle identification power is provided by the time of flight measured in a plastic scintillator tof wall , the electromagnetic shower characteristics observed in a pre - shower detector , and the energy - loss signals from the scintillators of the tof wall as well as from the four planes of drift chambers serving as tracking stations .",
    "charged particles are tracked through a toroidal magnetic field provided by a six - coil iron - less superconducting magnet .",
    "all technical aspects of the detector are described in  @xcite .    in the experiment discussed here a proton beam with a kinetic energy of @xmath17 = 3.5  gev  and an average intensity of about @xmath18 particles per second impinged onto a 12-fold segmented niobium ( @xmath0nb ) target with a total thickness of 5.4  mm and corresponding to 2.8% nuclear interaction probability .",
    "the online event selection was done in two steps : a 1@xmath19-level trigger ( lvl1 ) selected events with at least three charged - particle hits in the tof wall ( @xmath20 ) and a 2@xmath21-level trigger ( lvl2 ) fired if an electron or positron candidate was recognized .",
    "while all lvl2 events were recorded , the lvl1-only events were downscaled by a factor three before being written to data storage .",
    "this trigger scheme was in fact primarily optimized for studying inclusive @xmath6  production @xcite . to allow for trigger bias studies also",
    "lvl1 events requiring only two charged particles were recorded during part of the experiment .",
    "the lvl1 triggered on p+nb reactions with 56% efficiency in the @xmath20 mode and 72% efficiency in the @xmath22 mode .",
    "these efficiencies correspond to the fraction of reactions that actually fired the lvl1 trigger . in total @xmath23 events ",
    "downscaled lvl1 or lvl2  were recorded , corresponding to @xmath24 inspected lvl1 events and @xmath25 reactions in the target .    to study neutral - meson production the off - line data analysis searched for events containing four lepton tracks from which the 4-momentum of @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons was fully reconstructed .",
    "indeed , the electromagnetic decays of the latter , that is mostly @xmath26e@xmath1e@xmath2 ( dalitz ) and @xmath27 , combined with the external conversion of the decay photon(s ) on material in the inner region of the hades detector lead to events with a characteristic 4-lepton signature , namely @xmath28 e@xmath1e@xmath2e@xmath1e@xmath2 .",
    "simulations show that the dalitz decay contributes 25% ( 30% ) of the detectable @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) yield .",
    "the direct branching into e@xmath1e@xmath2e@xmath1e@xmath2  due to the decay into two virtual photons ( @xmath29 ) is however very small @xcite and contributes in our case only about 2  2.5% of the total yield .",
    "electron and positron tracks were identified following the procedures described in detail in @xcite .",
    "as no dedicated start detector was present in this experimental run , the start time for the time - of - flight measurement was reconstructed event - by - event from the most optimal assignment of different particle hypotheses ( e@xmath2 or @xmath16 ) to tracks of negatively charged fast particles . in the extraction of the inclusive negative pion yields",
    "no direct use was however made of the time - of - flight information , and the pion identification was solely based on energy - loss vs. momentum cuts ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "positive pions were identified likewise but , their spectra being partially contaminated by the much more abundant protons , they were not analyzed further .",
    "the detection of high - energy photons via a full reconstruction of conversion pairs has been applied with success by the phenix @xcite and alice @xcite collaborations in ultrarelativistic collisions .",
    "although those experiments comprise also electromagnetic calorimeters for photon detection , this alternative method is considered to offer valuable supplementary information on thermal photon as well as neutral - meson production . as hades",
    "is presently not equipped with such a calorimeter , the conversion method opens a unique approach to @xmath3 and @xmath4 detection .",
    "meson reconstruction was realized with identified lepton tracks by joining opposite - sign leptons into @xmath6  pairs and by further combining those dileptons pairwise into e@xmath1e@xmath2e@xmath1e@xmath2  multiplets .",
    "calculating the four - lepton invariant mass @xmath30 and setting appropriate mass cuts allows to select the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , respectively .",
    "various opening angle cuts , optimized in extensive monte - carlo simulations , were applied to suppress combinations of uncorrelated leptons , namely @xmath31 on the dilepton with the smaller opening angle and @xmath32 on the second one ( all angles given in the laboratory system ) .",
    "the @xmath33 selection is optimal for conversion pairs while the @xmath34 cut accepts also the more massive and hence wider dalitz pairs .",
    "in addition , a cut was applied on the relative angle between the two dileptons in a multiplet , namely @xmath35 , to suppress spurious counts at low @xmath30 .",
    "these cuts were adjusted on the data in order to maximize the meson yield while keeping the background of uncorrelated combinations low .",

    "we have generated meson distributions with the pluto event generator @xcite , tracked the resulting particles through a realistic model of the hades setup with the geant3 physics simulation tool @xcite , embedded those tracks into real events from the p+nb experiment , and reconstructed the overlayed events with the full hades lepton analysis .",
    "the purpose of the embedding was to include realistic detector noise into the procedure .",
    "as the lepton identification in hades relies primarily on the rich detector , only conversion pairs produced in the inner parts of the setup can contribute to the e@xmath1e@xmath2e@xmath1e@xmath2  signal .",
    "these are the niobium target segments , the carbon - composite target holder , the carbon - composite beam pipe , and the rich radiator gas c@xmath39f@xmath40 .",
    "conversion pairs produced in the rich mirror or in any of the following materials are not detectable .",
    "average conversion probabilities @xmath41 of @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay photons obtained from the simulations are listed in table  [ convtable ] .",
    "more than half of the conversion takes place in the niobium targets and the rest in the target holder , the beam pipe , and the rich converter gas , with a the cumulated probability of 3.54.1% per photon . the difference in probabilities for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "respectively , is related to the energy dependence of the conversion process .",
    "as the hades pair vertex resolution , of the order of 23  cm , is not good enough to cleanly isolate the various converter parts in the event reconstruction we have refrained from applying specific vertex cuts and have exploited the cumulated conversion effect .",
    "systematic errors on the total conversion probability result mainly from uncertainties on the material budget and the alignment of the relevant inner detector parts .",
    "the thickness of the target foils is known with an error of 2% and their misalignment in the beam pipe adds another 4% error .",
    "inhomogeneities of the carbon - composite material lead to an estimated uncertainty of 10% on the holder and pipe contributions . finally , for the radiator contribution we assume a 5% error .",
    "this leads then to an overall systematic error on the total material budget of 5% and hence an error of about 10% on the effciency for detecting double conversion events .    as we do not apply a secondary vertex selection to the @xmath6  pairs",
    "also dalitz decays are included in our pair signal . in the dalitz case , of course , only the one real photon is required to convert .",
    "the combined branching into all contributing final states ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) amounts to @xmath45% for the @xmath3 and to @xmath46% for the @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the meson sources used in the simulation were modeled according to a fireball @xcite characterized by a temperature in the range @xmath47= 8090  mev  and a central laboratory rapidity in the range @xmath48= 0.920.96 .",
    "as discussed below , the choice of these values is motivated by the data itself ( cf . also figs .",

    "the monte carlo shows that the total detection efficiency _",
    "eff_@xmath49 depends only weakly on the meson source properties and mostly on the photon conversion probability , on the geometric detector acceptance with respect to @xmath50 _ acc _ , and on the pair reconstruction efficiency _ eff_. in this definition , _ acc _ includes the lepton low - momentum cutoff at around 50  mevdue to the track bending in the hades magnet field and _ eff _ accounts for all detection and reconstruction losses within the hades acceptance . as all of these quantities are averaged over the two - photon , the dalitz , and the small direct decay channels it is useful to introduce an effective branching ratio _",

    "systematic errors on the simulated efficiencies result from the uncertainties on the conversion probabilities ( 5% on @xmath56 , 7.5% on @xmath57 ) , on the branching ratios of the contributing decays ( 1% on @xmath57 for @xmath3 and 2% for @xmath4 , from @xcite ) , and on the detector and reconstruction efficiencies ( 10% , from a comparison of various simulated and measured observables in the hades detector @xcite ) .",
    "combining all of these contributions we assign to the total efficiency a conservative systematic error of 15% .",

    "gev/@xmath60 , in the hades magnetic field . because of the large mass of the eta meson , its efficiency is much less afflicted by low - momentum tracks and",

    "[ hades_pim ]    as pointed out above , besides measuring e@xmath1 and e@xmath2 , the hades detector also provides high - quality data on charged hadrons . here",

    "this is also corroborated by various transport - model calculations @xcite .",
    "integrating @xmath63 within the hades rapidity coverage we find an accepted @xmath16 yield of 0.50  per lvl1 event . from simulations",

    "[ transport_pty ]    our observation that the rapidity distributions measured in the asymmetric p+nb system are centered at values @xmath134 strongly suggests that , beyond first - chance nucleon - nucleon collisions , secondary reactions , i.e. processes involving multiple successive interactions of baryons and/or mesons contribute sizably to particle production .",
    "a similar behavior had already been noticed for kaon production in a previous study of p+au collisions at comparable bombarding energies @xcite . while the observed phase space population of the eta agrees quite well with a fireball description , this is questionable for the pion .",
    "complete thermalization is apparently not reached in the p+nb reaction and a transport - theoretical approach is required to model the complex interplay between reaction dynamics and particle production .",
    "transport models typically handle meson and baryon production at energies up to a few gev  by resonance excitation and at higher energies through string fragmentation . in that respect ,",
    "our beam energy is particularly challenging because it is situated in the transition region between these two regimes .    in the following we compare our results with three transport calculations done with either urqmd ,",
    "the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( version v3.3p1 , see @xcite ) , gibuu , the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck model ( version 1.5 , see @xcite ) , or hsd , the hadron string dynamics model ( version 2.7 , see @xcite ) . at 3.5  gev  bombarding energy , corresponding to @xmath135 = 3.18  gev , urqmd runs in the resonance regime only whereas hsd switches over to string fragmentation mode at @xmath135 = 2.6  gev . for gibuu , on the other hand",
    ", we present calculations done with two different realizations of this model : ( i ) the original implementation with a smooth transition to string fragmentation at @xmath135 = 2.6  gev  and ( ii ) a version ( denoted hereafter by `` ext . res . '' ) where the resonance region has been extended up to about @xmath135 = 3.5  gev  @xcite .",

    "notice also that at low @xmath58 the standard implementation of gibuu behaves more in line with urqmd than the one with an extended resonance region .",

    ". both versions of gibuu , on the other hand , do fairly well in describing the @xmath4 rapidity distribution and integrated yield ( see table  [ modeltable ] ) , and its extended - resonance implementation also possesses the correct transverse - momentum behavior .",
    "the hsd pion and eta yields , finally , do agree fairly well with the data , albeit their @xmath73 and @xmath58 distributions deviate substantially .",
    "the complete lack of data in the energy range discussed here probably explains why the models tend to perform worse for @xmath4 production than they do for pions",
