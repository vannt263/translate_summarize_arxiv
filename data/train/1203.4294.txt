    "in recent years , there have been a number of results concerning knots with high distance bridge surfaces . for example , in @xcite bachman and schleimer show that any essential surface in the complement of such a knot must have high genus .",
    "this result is generalized in @xcite , where it was shown that any other bridge surface of such a knot must also have high genus or a high number of marked points .",
    "several other recent constructions of interesting examples rely on such knots  in @xcite blair and tomova construct knots for which width is not additive , and in @xcite johnson and tomova construct examples of knots with two different bridge surfaces that require a high number of stabilizations and perturbations to become isotopic .",
    "we present the first construction of a knot with a high distance bridge surface .",
    "in fact , given a collection of ( surface , integer)-pairs with some minor restrictions , we show how to construct a ( 3-manifold , tangle)-pair with the collection of surfaces being the boundary of the manifold and with the prescribed number of boundary points of the tangle on each surface .",
    "we can choose our ( 3-manifold , tangle)-pair to be of arbitrarily high distance and have a given number of components .",
    "our construction is explicit and purely combinatorial .",
    "many of the ideas in this paper are rooted in @xcite where evans constructs 3-manifolds with arbitrarily high distance heegaard splittings .",
    "we have made a number of generalizations and improvements to evans arguments .",
    "some of these are necessitated by our more general setting , which allows for marked surfaces ( the definition is provided in section [ sec : bridge_surfaces ] ) , and some are introduced to make the arguments more elegant and easier to follow . in particular , we eliminate the language of stacks and partial stacks used by evans and replace it with a more intuitive description .",
    "we also develop tools to control the number of components of the link we are constructing , a challenge that does nt arise in the set - up considered by evans .",
    "in most of the paper , we will restrict our attention to a link @xmath5 in a closed 3-manifold @xmath4 . in the last section of the paper",
