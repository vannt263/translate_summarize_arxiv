    "d - branes have come to play a fundamental role in our understanding of string theory , especially for the case calabi - yau ( cy ) compactifications .",
    "subsequent to the initial description of d - branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of cy manifolds @xcite , it was realised that a and b - type d - branes are closely related to the objects that are relevant to kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry proposal@xcite .",
    "the fact that mirror symmetry , generally speaking , exchanges a - branes and b - branes has begun to play a crucial role in understanding several aspects of stringy geometry on calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "one of the applications of mirror symmetry in type ii compactifications has been the computation of closed string instanton corrections to various physical quantities . with the inclusion of d - brane sectors for strings moving on calabi - yau backgrounds ,",
    "one has , in addition , to consider a generalisation of mirror symmetry that also includes the open string sectors .",
    "in particular , one may expect that mirror symmetry in the open and closed string sectors taken together is relevant to understanding the contribution of open - string instanton corrections .",
    "in contrast to the case of purely closed strings on cy , it has been pointed out that various quantities in the world - volume theories of both a and b type d - branes acquire open - string instanton corrections . in general",
    "it is expected that the f - terms in the world - volume theory have open - string instanton corrections for a - branes whereas the d - terms are the ones that acquire instanton corrections for b - branes@xcite .",
    "various general considerations relevant to open - string instanton corrections in the case of compact calabi - yau manifolds as well as non - compact calabi - yau manifolds have been studied earlier@xcite .",
    "however the explicit calculation of open - string instanton corrections to the world - volume superpotential for a - branes using mirror symmetry have first appeared recently in the important work of aganagic and vafa @xcite and aganagic , klemm and vafa@xcite .",
    "the authors in these papers have computed the world - volume superpotential for some non - compact a - branes in non - compact calabi - yau manifolds ( in particular , those that can be described without a world - sheet superpotential ) , by appealing to mirror symmetry and using the holomorphic chern - simons action on the b - brane side to reduce the problem to a more tractable computation .",
    "this computation uses and extends the techniques first described in @xcite , whereby the mirror transformation , in the presence of d - branes , can be explicitly implemented as a world - sheet duality transformation involving the fields of a gauged linear sigma model ( glsm ) that describes these d - brane configurations .",
    "remarkably , the authors of @xcite showed that the ( instanton generated ) a - brane superpotential thus computed conformed exactly to the strong integrality predictions of such quantities from completely different considerations of large @xmath0 duality @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall here the manner in which this integrality predictions were first made . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the large @xmath0 limit of chern - simons theory on @xmath1 is dual to a - type closed topological string theory on the resolved conifold , with a particular identification between the parameters of the two theories .",
    "this conjecture was verified at the level of the partition function on both sides .",
    "the conjecture was extended to the observables of the chern - simons theory , namely the knot invariants in @xcite . by identifying the extra d - branes ( associated with the knots on the chern - simons side ) on the resolved conifold , non - trivial predictions",
    "were made in @xcite regarding the structure of the topological string amplitudes , using ideas of @xcite .",
    "( knot theoretic aspects of the conjecture were verified in @xcite . )",
    "further , from the fact that topological disc amplitudes compute superpotential terms in @xmath2 @xmath3 gauge theories , a general structure for the a - type superpotential was proposed , which had the integrality properties that we referred to above .",
    "it is of interest to ask the question whether the a - brane world - volume superpotential , together with the open - string instanton corrections , can be directly computed without explicit recourse to mirror symmetry , particularly in the framework of the glsm@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will take the first steps in this direction .",
    "we will show that the description of the a - branes in the linear sigma model framework suggests a natural and concrete description of these ( partially compactified ) open - string instanton moduli spaces .",
    "these instanton moduli spaces will be seen to be intimately related to some auxiliary toric varieties that we shall refer to as _ boundary toric varieties_. for these boundary toric varieties we will write down the appropriate gelfand - kapranov - zelevinsky ( gkz ) differential equations , by an extension of the methods developed for the closed string case , particularly for non - compact cy manifolds by @xcite . we will then show how the relevant solutions of the gkz equations describe the world - volume superpotential for the a - branes in the examples considered by @xcite .",
    "we will also show how to obtain the analogue of the open - string mirror map in this context , using in part , an ansatz due to aganagic , klemm and vafa .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe some basic facts about the gauged linear sigma model . after describing the construction of a and b - type superspace",
    ", we discuss the boundary conditions of @xcite that describes a - branes . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the glsm for a - branes and the boundary conditions therein . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the topological aspects of the a - model , before moving on , in section 5 , to the open string instanton moduli space . after discussing briefly certain issues of stability",
    ", we introduce the boundary toric variety . in section 6 ,",
    "we consider aspects of local mirror symmetry and the gkz system of equations for our boundary toric variety .",
    "we discuss how to obtain the bulk and boundary periods that are relevant for the computation of the a - brane superpotential in the mirror . section 7 deals with some examples in order to illustrate the methods .",
    "we conclude with some observations in section 8 .",
    "the supersymmetry generators for @xmath4 supersymmetry can be written as ( in the notation of @xcite ) @xmath5 in superspace with coordinates @xmath6 , the supersymmetry generators have the following representation @xmath7    on the boundary , one set of linear combinations of this supersymmetry is preserved .",
    "let us denote the unbroken supersymmetry generators by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let us denote the boundary in superspace by the coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "then , the supersymmetry generators can be given the following representation @xmath11 we will now work out the precise relationship between the boundary coordinates/ supersymmetry generators .",
    "we will deal with the a- and b - type cases separately .      under a - type",
    "supersymmetry , let @xmath12 where we use the subscript @xmath13 to denote that we are considering boundaries that preserve a - type supersymmetry .",
    "then , on using @xmath14 we obtain @xmath15      in a similar fashion one chooses @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 from which we identify @xmath18      in boundary superspace with coordinates @xmath10 , the superderivatives are @xmath19 we will deal with two kinds of boundary multiplets : a boundary chiral multiplet and an unconstrained complex multiplet .",
    "a * boundary chiral multiplet * satisfying the constraint @xmath20 which has the following component expansion @xmath21    an unconstrained * complex superfield * @xmath22 with component expansion @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real fields . under supersymmetry ,",
    "the transformations are @xmath26    now consider a complex superfield with the following gauge invariance @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a chiral superfield .",
    "a gauge - invariant observable is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the invariance trivially follows from the chirality of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath30 has the following superfield expansion @xmath31    we will identify the real part of @xmath22 with the bosonic @xmath32 discussed earlier . keeping this in mind , we can partially gauge - fix the imaginary part of @xmath22 as follows @xmath33 note that the gauge choice is algebraic and hence we will call it the wess - zumino ( wz ) gauge .",
    "this leaves us with the following gauge invariance which acts as @xmath34 in the wz gauge , the field @xmath22 has the following superfield expansion @xmath35 where @xmath32 is now a real field .",
    "thus , if @xmath36 , it would be a real superfield .",
    "the supersymmetry and gauge transformations which preserve the wz gauge are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is now a real parameter .",
    "notice that @xmath25 is invariant under supersymmetry and transforms as @xmath39 under gauge transformations and thus behaves as a gauge field .",
    "first , consider a chiral superfield @xmath40 which has the following component expansion : @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & i \\sqrt2 \\theta^+\\theta^-\\bar{\\theta}^+ [ ( d_0 + d_1)\\psi_-   + \\sqrt2 q \\sigma \\psi_+]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to obtain the a - type superfield , we need to set @xmath42 thus , we obtain @xmath43 where the prime indicates an a - type superfield .",
    "this is a complex unconstrained superfield .",
    "next , let us consider a twisted chiral superfield @xmath44 which has the following component expansion @xmath45 we define the a - type superfield @xmath46 as in the case of the chiral superfield .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 which is the superfield expansion for an a - type chiral superfield .",
    "in addition , one obtains a fermi chiral superfield @xmath48 whose lowest component is @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 where one treats @xmath51 as an a - type chiral superfield with lowest component @xmath52 .",
    "the component expansion for @xmath48 is @xmath53\\ ] ] something interesting happens if @xmath54 is set to zero on the boundary ( part of which we know is required by the vanishing of ordinary variations ) .",
    "then , using the bulk equations of motion for the @xmath55 s , one can see that @xmath48 becomes an _ anti - chiral _ boundary superfield .",
    "aganagic and vafa@xcite have constructed a class of special lagrangian(sl ) cycles in toric varieties by adapting the construction of harvey and lawson in @xmath56 .",
    "we shall describe this construction in the language of the glsm .",
    "let @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) be the chiral superfields with @xmath59 charges @xmath60 which appear in the gauged linear sigma model associated with the toric variety .",
    "the toric variety is obtained by imposing the ( bulk ) d - term constraint given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "after taking into account the gauge invariances involved , one ends up with some weighted projective space ( actually , a line bundle on that space ) of dimension @xmath63 .",
    "this is the standard procedure called _",
    "symplectic reduction_. the calabi - yau condition is given by @xmath64 .",
    "lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath56 are specified by the following d - term like conditions @xmath65 note however that there is no associated local @xmath59 invariance as occurs in symplectic reduction .",
    "one further imposes @xmath66 additional conditions on linear combinations of the phases @xmath67 of the fields @xmath68 @xmath69 the @xmath70 specify a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath56 ( with the standard symplectic structure ) if @xmath71 in order for this lagrangian submanifold in @xmath56 to descend to the toric variety , we choose @xmath72 of the conditions given above to be the d - term conditions associated with the toric variety . the conditions @xmath73",
    "imply that the conditions on the phases are invariant under @xmath59 gauge transformations .",
    "further , it follows that the submanifold is special lagrangian if @xmath74 this is clearly compatible with the calabi - yau condition on the bulk @xmath59 charges .    for generic values of @xmath75 ,",
    "the sl submanifolds have a boundary .",
    "one can obtain sl submanifolds without boundary by a doubling procedure . however , there exist non - generic situations ( such as the case when one of the @xmath75 vanish ) where the doubling is not necessary . in other words , when we take an sl submanifold without boundary for generic values of @xmath75 to the non - generic value , the sl manifold splits into two",
    ". we shall refer to one component as an _ half - brane _ following av@xcite . in the toric description , _ half - branes _",
    "lie on the edges of toric skeletons .    in order to be more concrete ,",
    "let us consider a specific example furnished by the non - compact calabi - yau manifold given by the total space of the line - bundle @xmath76 over @xmath77 .",
    "this non - compact calabi - yau manifold is described in the glsm by four fields with @xmath59 charge @xmath78 and the boundary conditions of the special lagrangian submanifold are given by @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for generic values of @xmath75 , the topology of the sl submanifolds ( after doubling ) is @xmath82 .",
    "however , for suitable choices of @xmath75 ( see below ) , one obtains half - branes which are topologically @xmath83 ,    following the discussion in akv@xcite , there are three phases ( half - branes ) of interest : phase i given by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , phase ii given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 and phase iii is given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the relevant phase diagram is as follows    in phase i , for large values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 when quantum corrections are small , @xmath90 measures the size of a holomorphic disc ending on the half - brane .",
    "this is the real part of a complex modulus , @xmath92 , whose imaginary part corresponds to turning on a wilson line wrapping the @xmath93 of the half - brane .",
    "@xmath94 is the other modulus associated with the other @xmath93 which appears for generic values of @xmath75 vanishes on the half - brane .",
    "these values suffer quantum corrections which become relevant for small values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we will denote the quantum corrected quantities by unhatted quantities .",
    "however , @xmath95 will not be independent and will be determined as a function of @xmath96 on the half - brane .      as we mentioned in the introduction , the essential idea of @xcite is to compute the superpotential for the a - branes described in the last subsection by using mirror symmetry to calculate this in the b - model . here",
    ", we will briefly review their arguments",
    ". we will be interested in the case of a space - filling d6-brane wrapping a sl cycle of a non - compact cy three - fold .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the amplitude of interest , the ( instanton generated ) disc amplitude in the a - model , is of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the ( complexified ) volume of the holomorphic disc with boundary ending on a particular one - cycle on the sl submanifold and @xmath100 , @xmath101 being the closed string khler class .",
    "@xmath102 are the winding numbers associated with the holomorphic disc i.e. , an element of @xmath103 of the sl submanifold and @xmath104 is an element of @xmath105 of the cy .",
    "the integer @xmath106 relates to the multiple coverings of these .",
    "further , this prediction involves the highly non - trivial integers @xmath107 , that count the number of primitive disc instantons in this homology class .",
    "these have the interpretation of counting the degeneracy of domain wall d4-branes ending on the space - filling d6-brane@xcite , which wrap a 2-cycle in the cy ( whose khler class is given by @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 denotes the wrapping number around the boundary .",
    "since a direct computation of the superpotential in the a - model involves summing up open - string instantons , av and akv use the mirror map of @xcite to map this computation to one involving holomorphic chern - simons theory in the mirror b - model . for the case when the b - brane is of complex dimension one , and wraps a riemann surface @xmath110 in the mirror cy , the dimensional reduction of the chern - simons theory on @xmath110 was computed in @xcite in terms of the holomorphic three - form of the chern - simons theory restricted to the brane and two scalar fields ( denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath111 parametrising normal deformations of the b - brane in the mirror cy and @xmath95 , respectively , in the notation of the previous subsection . for the convenience of the reader , we shall use the convention of akv in this subsection . ] .",
    "the final result for the superpotential is given by the the abel - jacobi map associated with the one - form @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the ` location ' of the half - brane .",
    "@xmath111 is fixed on the b - model side by the condition that @xmath115 be points on the riemann surface @xmath110 .",
    "however , from the a - model viewpoint , it suffices to note that @xmath116 which is obtained from the abel - jacobi map .",
    "there are a couple of issues that one has to address before one can translate these results in the b - model to the a - model side .",
    "first , there is an @xmath117 ambiguity in the parametrisation of the b - model variables given by @xmath118 thus , the superpotential given above is also dependent on the choice of @xmath32 and @xmath111 .",
    "second , the variables which appear in the b - model side are not the same as the ones that appear in the a - model .",
    "the change of variables that relates the two is the _ open - string mirror map_.    however , in the limit where quantum corrections are suppressed in the a - model , i.e. , where the volumes of the holomorphic disc and the cy are large , one can relate the two sets of variables .",
    "however , the condition that re(@xmath32 ) be the volume of the holomorphic disc and @xmath119 in this limit , breaks the @xmath117 down to the subgroup given by @xmath120 thus , imposing the classical limit leaves us with an ambiguity parametrised by the integer @xmath106 .",
    "it turns out that for cases where the a - model is dual to large @xmath0 chern - simons theory@xcite , this integer reflects a framing ambiguity in the chern - simons theory .",
    "the framing ambiguity has recently been studied in the context of the wilson loop variables of chern - simons theory in @xcite , and evidence has been found that the above mentioned duality is more appropriate in the context of @xmath121 chern - simons theories rather than the @xmath122 ones originally considered in the proposal of @xcite .",
    "initial works on knot invariants were insensitive to this because the computations were performed in the standard framing , where the @xmath121 and @xmath122 knot invariants are the same .",
    "however , hints of this had already appeared in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "explicit computations of certain @xmath121 wilson loop operators have been carried out , and the results have been shown to conform to the integrality predictions of @xcite .    aside from the ambiguity mentioned above , one has to obtain the open - string mirror map in order to obtain the a - model results .",
    "it has been argued in akv that the appropriate variables are given by@xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 receives corrections only from closed - string instantons .",
    "@xmath124 is computed by identifying it with the tension of the domain wall which is mirror to the d4-brane in the a - model .",
    "the variables @xmath32 and @xmath111 are conjugate fields of the holomorphic chern - simons theory .",
    "the second equation corresponds to the condition that @xmath125 remains conjugate to @xmath124 in the quantum theory .    as we will see in the next section , the b - model variables , i.e.",
    ", the unhatted variables , naturally appear in the glsm that we construct to describe these half - branes .",
    "the basic a - type boundary conditions that one considers in a glsm with @xmath106 chiral superfields and @xmath91 @xmath59 vector multiplets are @xmath126 the bosonic boundary conditions ( in the matter sector ) are completed by the following @xmath66 conditions @xmath127 where the _ lagrangian condition _ implies that the @xmath111 s satisfy @xmath128 this condition permits us to identify , in the toric description , the @xmath129 with the integral generators of the one - dimensional cones in the fan @xmath130 , the combinatoric data associated with the toric variety .",
    "the boundary conditions on the vector multiplet are given by the superfield condition @xmath131 the easy way to understand this is to notice that in the topological a - model , the field @xmath132 is proportional to the khler form @xmath133 whose restriction on a lagrangian submanifold is zero .",
    "the vanishing of the boundary terms in the ordinary variation is obtained by the conditions @xmath134 the above set of boundary conditions form a _ consistent _ set of boundary conditions in the glsm which also have a proper nlsm limit in the sense used in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath135 the boundary state ( in the glsm ) that corresponds to these boundary conditions .",
    "this reference state plays a role similar to the d6-brane in the context of b - branes in the glsm@xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that it corresponds to the d6-brane in the mirror calabi - yau manifold .",
    "it is also rigid i.e. , there are no moduli associated with this sl submanifold .",
    "the boundary conditions that av choose can be implemented in the glsm in a simple fashion . in the matter sector , it corresponds to simply replacing some of the @xmath111 s by boundary conditions of the form , where @xmath136 are the _ dual basis vectors _ ( in @xmath56 ) to the @xmath137 i.e. , they satisfy : @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . ]",
    "@xmath141 in the glsm , we will realise these boundary conditions as _ low - energy conditions _ using complex boundary supermultiplets @xmath142 .",
    "the corresponding boundary state can be represented by the path - integral @xmath143\\ \\exp(s_1+s_2+s_3)\\ |{\\cal b}\\rangle_0\\ ] ] where @xmath144\\ ] ] this action is invariant under the gauge - invariances @xmath145 where @xmath146 are chiral superfields .",
    "this gauge invariances enable us to identify the real parts of the lowest components of the superfields @xmath142 and with `` coordinates '' on an appropriate three - cycle .",
    "the action @xmath147 is also invariant under bulk gauge transformations . on using the fact that @xmath148 are generators of the bulk gauge invariance ,",
    "one obtains that @xmath149 given that @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( given below ) are also gauge - invariant .    the kinetic energy for @xmath152 @xmath153 where we have introduced the coupling constant @xmath154 on the boundary .",
    "this has mass dimension half .",
    "we can now introduce the boundary analogue of the f.i .",

    "the @xmath160 term is a topological term as one expects .",
    "thus , we can see that the real part of @xmath25 behaves like the bulk @xmath161 term while the imaginary part should behave like @xmath162 . in order for this correspondence to work",
    ", we should require that ( after wick rotation to euclidean space and @xmath163 becomes a circle variable which we will call @xmath164 with periodicity @xmath165 ) @xmath166 where @xmath167 are some integers .",
    "in order to discuss the topological aspects of the a - model , we need to wick rotate : @xmath168 ( hence one has @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) .",
    "let us choose to twist the model so that @xmath9 is the brst operator .",
    "for the closed string case , the localisation equations are@xcite @xmath172 .",

    "suppose , we treat the d - term - like boundary conditions which are specified by @xmath217 on par with the bulk d - terms specified by @xmath60 .",
    "the special lagrangian condition @xmath218 now becomes the calabi - yau condition on a toric - variety which we shall call the _ boundary toric variety_. the boundary moduli now become bulk moduli on the toric variety .",
    "one can see that the spaces @xmath215 and @xmath219 obtained in the previous subsection play a similar role for the boundary toric variety .",
    "a well known method of computing mirror periods of a calabi - yau hypersurface is by the picard - fuchs system of differential equations . by treating the bulk and the boundary d - term constraints on the same footing , one might hope to compute the period integrals of the boundary toric variety in a similar fashion .",
    "this should , in principle , directly give the necessary variables for the computation of the worldvolume superpotential for a - branes .",
    "in the following sections , we will proceed with such a computation , and show that the boundary toric variety indeed reproduces the structure of the a - model amplitude predicted in @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , the toric data is seen in the glsm construction through the @xmath59 charges , @xmath60 ( @xmath220 ) , of the chiral superfields and @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ) which are the integral generators of one - dimensional cones in the fan @xmath130 of the toric variety .",
    "consider the differential operators constructed from this data @xmath223 with @xmath224 and @xmath225 are coordinates on @xmath56 .",
    "the two operators given above define a consistent system of differential equations , due to gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky , the gkz hypergeometric system with exponent @xmath226 @xmath227    it is known that the periods ( associated with three - cycles ) of the mirror calabi - yau manifold are solutions of a picard - fuchs differential equation which naturally arises in the special geometry associated with vector multiplets with @xmath228 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "it turns out that for the cy manifolds which arise as hypersurfaces in toric varieties , the gkz equations described above are closely related to these picard - fuchs equations . in the cases that we will be interested in ,",
    "the above system of equations provide the picard - fuchs differential equations . in general however , one may need to supplement the above system by additional differential operators to convert the gkz into the relevant picard - fuchs equation .",
    "the second set of differential equations , i.e. , those given by the @xmath229 , are solved for by a change of variables @xmath230 given by @xmath231 and the change @xmath232 .",
    "further , it is useful to rewrite the differential operators @xmath233 in terms of logarithmic derivatives @xmath234 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath235 is the large - volume limit .",
    "there are two classes of solutions ( periods ) of the gkz equation which are of interest ( see @xcite for the case of compact cy manifolds and @xcite for the non - compact case [ local mirror symmetry ] ) .    1 .   those with logarithmic behaviour as @xmath236",
    "these are important in providing the change of variables which form the _ mirror map_. this also relates the the glsm variables with the nlsm ( large - volume ) variables .",
    "this is clearly seen in the work of morrison and plesser@xcite .",
    "2 .   those that behave as @xmath237 as @xmath236 . using special geometry ,",
    "these are related to the first derivatives of the prepotential .",
    "this prepotential encodes the corrections due to closed - string instantons to the classical one obtained from the triple intersection numbers of two - cycles on the cy manifold .",
    "we will now show that we can sensibly fit the case of lsm with boundary into this framework and write down the corresponding gkz equations .",
    "we will explicitly show this for all the cases that have been considered by av and akv . loosely speaking",
    ", the av boundary conditions correspond to replacing some of the @xmath111 s with @xmath238 s .",
    "this suggests that the gkz obtained by the set of charge vectors @xmath239 might be relevant for obtaining the open - string instanton effects just as the bulk gkz for the closed - string case .",
    "consider the following operators @xmath240 this is the gkz which is naturally associated with the boundary toric variety . as before , we will solve the differential equations given by @xmath241 by a change of variables @xmath242 where @xmath243 are related to boundary moduli just as the @xmath244 are related to bulk moduli .",
    "it is useful to separate the remaining differential operators into those that arise from the @xmath60 ( we will call these @xmath245 ) and those that arise from the @xmath217 ( we will call these @xmath246 ) . note that @xmath245 is not quite the differential operator which appears in the closed - string gkz  it also involves the boundary variables .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the cases of the half - branes with topology @xmath83 and let @xmath247 be the modulus associated with the @xmath93 .",
    "the limit where quantum corrections are small is given by @xmath248 .    by construction , the bulk periods are solutions of the differential equations involving @xmath245 .",
    "in particular , the solutions that provide the _ closed - string mirror map _ are solutions with asymptotic behaviour @xmath249 as @xmath250 .",
    "the akv ansatz plays a similar role in obtaining the _ open - string mirror map _",
    "i.e. , we look for solutions of @xmath245 with the property @xmath251 it is not hard to see that the above ansatz is not compatible with @xmath246 since @xmath130 is not a function of @xmath252 .    the solution associated with the superpotential is obtained by an ansatz of the form @xmath253 where we require that the zero instanton contribution vanish i.e. , @xmath254 and the only non - vanishing @xmath255 are as given by the considerations of section 5 . to be more precise",
    ", we set @xmath256 whenever the corresponding instanton moduli space does not exist . unlike the solution associated with the open - string mirror map we require that this solves the full boundary gkz differential equation .",

    "one requires that @xmath270 . it can be argued that the general solution should take the form @xmath271 i.e. , the boundary flat coordinate differs from the glsm coordinate only by closed moduli .",
    "one can then easily prove that @xmath272 is a solution of the first of the two equations ( i.e. , @xmath245 ) that make up the boundary gkz equations .",
    "defining @xmath273 , one obtains the following @xmath274 this equation along with the earlier equation for @xmath204 , gives us the required change of variables from @xmath275 to the flat coordinates @xmath276 and @xmath238 .",

    ", we expect the framing ambiguity to be associated with a monodromy of the gkz solutions and that in the compact case , this ambiguity should be lifted by global considerations .    a ` derivation ' of the gkz equations that we use can be obtained in a fashion similar to the closed - string case . by extending the hori - vafa @xcite mirror map , one can represent the periods on the b - model side as a functional integral over some dual fields with appropriate superpotentials corresponding to all the d - terms , bulk and boundary , that appear on the a - model side . using this representation , it is possible to derive the appropriate gkz in a manner similar to that of hori and vafa for the closed - string periods . from a somewhat different view point ,",
    "one notices that the periods can be represented as an integral of the holomorphic three - form over the three - cycle and then one may obtain the differential equation satisfied by the periods .",
    "the gkz equations that we use can be derived by replacing the integral over the holomorphic three - form by the holomorphic chern - simons action .",
