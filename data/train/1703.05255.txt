    "the unitarity method  @xcite constructs scattering amplitudes from their unitarity and analytic structure .",
    "it is convenient to work at the integrand level where factorization properties tie the leading coefficients of the propagator poles to products of tree amplitudes . in the last decade ,",
    "numerical approaches  @xcite have been developed that construct one - loop amplitudes from their propagator poles , which are given by tree amplitudes .",
    "beyond one loop , feynman rules naturally yield contributions with higher - order propagator powers . in order to determine the rational integrand ,",
    "one thus has to obtain leading and subleading coefficients on such propagator poles .",
    "of these , only the leading ones are directly related to a product of tree amplitudes and the subleading terms have to be obtained differently . for analytic computations",
    "this obstruction has been discussed in @xcite where the residue extraction is adjusted to pick up subleading - pole contributions .",
    "alternatively , in analytic computations of two - loop qcd amplitudes  @xcite , the subleading - pole contributions can be tracked explicitly and evaluated or , in the case of particular helicity amplitudes , dealt with by choosing particular representations of the integrand  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we propose a numerical algorithm to extract subleading - pole contributions without resorting to analytic manipulations .",
    "the central idea is to ` cut less ' , i.e. to obtain subleading - pole contributions from their contribution to cuts which keep the respective propagators off - shell .",
    "we find that the algorithm works effectively when applied to a numerical calculation of two - loop four - gluon amplitudes .",
    "we validate our approach by comparing it to the known analytic results  @xcite , and by carrying out a number of non - trivial consistency checks .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we describe the organization of a calculation in the numerical unitarity method , discuss the appearance of subleading - pole terms starting at two - loops , and present our algorithm for extracting those terms .",
    "section  [ sec : applications ] contains applications in the context of one- and two - loop four - gluon amplitudes as well as a list of checks performed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : outlook ] we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "in this section , we review the main aspects of the numerical unitarity method at two loops . we introduce our notation , explain the appearance of subleading - pole terms at two loops and present our algorithm to extract them .",
    "although we focus on two - loop calculations , our result can be easily generalized for computing general subleading - pole contributions in multi - loop amplitudes .",
    "we will organize amplitudes in terms of diagrams , which can be constructed from the usual feynman diagram decomposition in the following way : we strip feynman diagrams of particle information and pinch all propagators through which loop momentum does not flow .",
    "we will denote the set of all diagrams constructed in this way by @xmath0 . in the remainder of this paper , a diagram @xmath1 denotes an element of this set , @xmath2 .",
    "each @xmath1 defines a set of propagator indices @xmath3 , and we call the set of inverse propagators @xmath4 with @xmath5 a _ propagator structure_. as we allow for elements in @xmath3 to be repeated , technically we should call @xmath3 a multiset , but we avoid this terminology .",
    "in we show a generic diagram @xmath1 for a planar two - loop amplitude . finally , we associate the notion of _ hierarchy _ to @xmath0 . if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two elements of @xmath0 , such that @xmath7 is obtained by pinching some of the edges of @xmath6 , then they are members of the same hierarchy .",
    "@xmath6 is called an ancestor of @xmath7 , and we write @xmath8 to denote ancestry .",
    "all of the descedant s propagators are contained in any of its ancestors , i.e.  @xmath9 .",
    "different hierarchies in @xmath0 are named according to their element with the fewest edges .     and @xmath10 are arbitrary , and the other @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined by momentum conservation . ]",
    "the scattering amplitude  @xmath13 is decomposed in the general form @xmath14 in terms of a set of _ master integrals _ @xmath15 and coefficient functions @xmath16 .",
    "we organize the sum over master integrals according to their propagator structure labeled by @xmath1 . by @xmath17",
    "we denote the set of indices @xmath18 which label the different master integrals that share the same propagator structure .",
    "@xmath17 can be empty if no master integral is associated with diagram @xmath1 .",
    "we work in dimensional regularization , so that the integrals and their coefficients depend on the space - time dimension @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the integral coefficients depend on the dimensionality @xmath20 of the spin space for the loop particles  @xcite . for simplicity we neither display the dimensional dependence nor the natural dependence on kinematic variables .",
    "furthermore , for the present discussion it is sufficient to consider fixed values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for which the amplitude is finite .",
    "also , we always consider planar amplitudes , as this is sufficient for our purposes in this paper .    in a numerical approach , it is helpful to analyze prior to integrating over loop momenta , i.e. , to analyze the integrand @xmath21 .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 represents the momenta of the two loops and will be used to denote quantities defined at the integrand level .",
    "the integrand is decomposed into terms that contribute to the sum in , which we call _ master integrands _ , and independent _ surface integrands _ which integrate to zero  @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath17 and @xmath24 denote the set of master integrands and surface terms associated to diagram @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the numerator terms @xmath25 integrate either to master integrals or to zero , @xmath26 similar notation has been used for example in  @xcite . for future reference",
    ", we define the integrand numerator @xmath27 associated with the propagator structure  @xmath1 by @xmath28 the construction of the integrand representation in has been given in @xcite , using appropriate integration - by - parts ( ) identities  @xcite .",
    "the relations have to be chosen sufficiently general in order to include the propagator structures already present in the integrand @xmath29 of the amplitude , e.g. given by feynman rules .",
    "in particular , given that two - loop amplitudes contain diagrams with doubled propagators , we have to consider such propagator structures as well when constructing the sets of master integrands and surface terms .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath16 , can be obtained by solving the linear system of equations ( [ eq : al ] ) for generic values of the loop momentum . in the generalized unitarity approach ,",
    "the system of equations is analyzed diagram by diagram .",
    "for each diagram @xmath1 , we consider the specific values of the loop momenta @xmath30 where internal particles go on - shell , @xmath31 in the limit @xmath32 , both sides of diverge and the coefficients of the poles can be compared , yielding a refined system of equations .",
    "importantly , unitarity and factorization properties of field theory amplitudes imply that the leading coefficients of the poles in @xmath29 are given by products of tree amplitudes .    at ( 0,2 ) appears twice in diagram  ( a ) but only once in diagram ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ] ; at ( 0,1.7)(a ) ; at ( 1,2 ) appears twice in diagram  ( a ) but only once in diagram ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ] ; at ( 1,1.7)(b ) ;    the required tree amplitudes can also be indexed by the diagrams @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the set of tree amplitudes constructed in the following way : to each @xmath34-point vertex of @xmath1 , one associates an @xmath34-point tree amplitude evaluated on the on - shell momenta @xmath30 , with matched quantum numbers on internal lines .",
    "notice that not all diagrams @xmath1 give rise to a well defined product of tree amplitudes .",
    "an example of this is displayed in .",
    "the tree amplitude associated to the four - point vertex on the top right corner of diagram ( b ) behaves as @xmath35 and thus is divergent and ill - defined in the on - shell phase space of the diagram ( which sets @xmath36 ) .",
    "we will denote the subset of all diagrams which give rise to a well defined product of tree amplitudes by @xmath37 note that @xmath38 inherits the notion of hierarchy from @xmath0 .",

    "this was achieved through the following steps :    * we have implemented @xmath19-dimensional off - shell recursions  @xcite to compute all required trees and ( one- and ) two - loop cuts for generic computations in @xmath19-dimensional numerical unitarity .",
    "our implementation allows general values of the @xmath20 parameter , the dimensionality of the spin space for the loop particles .",
    "the numerical trees and one - loop cuts were cross checked against the library  @xcite in four dimensions .",
    "we have also cross checked our two - loop cuts against results obtained using an independent implementation of the gluon amplitudes in six dimensions .",
    "systematic checks of ward identities and factorization limits of the trees and cuts have been performed . * two independent implementations for the construction of the @xmath0 hierarchies and the associated subtraction structures",
    "have been produced , one based on planar configurations and another following the color decomposition of  @xcite .",
    "both have been cross checked , and independently shown to correctly produce subtraction terms for diagrams in @xmath38 . * in order to compare against known results for two - loop four - point gluon amplitudes , we have produced a set of master - surface integrand decompositions as in for all the diagrams @xmath1 in those amplitudes .",
    "the decompositions were produced along the lines of ref .",
    "we cross - checked that the surface integrands we constructed integrate to zero with the generator of relations fire  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the integrand decompositions fully span their corresponding integrand spaces by comparing them to an alternative parametrization in terms of tensor insertions @xcite . * with all the tools described above",
    ", we were able to numerically compute all integrand coefficients that contribute to the planar two - loop four - point gluon amplitude , see .",
    "we have validated the values of the master integral coefficients with the known analytic results  @xcite for all helicity configurations .",
    "most checks have been performed on a small set of phase - space points and we delay any systematic efficiency and stability checks of our implementation to future work .",
    "nevertheless it is worth mentioning that we find that for example the master coefficient functions of the bubble - box hierarchy in can be extracted in less that 100@xmath122 on generic phase - space points .",
    "typically we find that they agree with numerical values obtained from the analytic expressions @xcite to an accuracy of better than 10 digits .",
    "this study has been performed for fixed values of the dimensional parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 using only double - precision arithmetics .",
    "we note that this is the first time that two - loop master integral coefficients have been computed numerically with the unitarity method .",
    "in this article we have presented an algorithm for extracting subleading - pole contributions in two - loop scattering amplitudes through numerical unitarity techniques , which are required to obtain the full amplitude .",
    "subleading - pole integrand coefficients can be obtained by solving linear systems of equations built up from cut equations of associated descendant diagrams .",
    "the algorithm is process independent and can be naturally generalized to multi - loop amplitudes .",
    "we have performed a number of consistency checks , in which multiple subleading - pole contributions have been extracted at several levels of a two - loop cut hierarchy .",
    "in addition , we have computed for the first time two - loop master coefficients through numerical unitarity , and have confirmed our results by comparing to available analytic results for four - point two - loop gluon amplitudes . although in numerical unitarity one performs calculations in fixed dimensions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the regressions to general values of those parameters can be achieved by the observation that functionally they appear as rational or polynomial functions .",
    "we have reconstructed the full @xmath19 and @xmath20 dependence of all integral coefficients in the sunrise hierarchy in .",
    "details on this will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of the efficiency and stability of the numerical unitarity approach is left to future work , however , we have observed that the algorithm appears sufficiently fast and numerically stable .",
    "we hope in the future to explore the use of the numerical unitarity method to two - loop amplitudes with more than four external particles .",
    "the algorithm we presented to deal with subleading - pole contributions requires to handle an enlarged set of linear equations when computing integral coefficients .",
    "it would be interesting to explore alternative approaches which organize the cut equations more effectively .",
    "for example , it is possible to directly associate subleading contributions to subtracted gluon amplitudes to tree amplitudes with graviton exchange  @xcite .",
    "further ideas include accessing the subleading poles through numerical limits , or using bcj relations  @xcite to relate the subleading contributions to other color - ordered cuts .",
