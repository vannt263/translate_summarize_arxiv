    "x - ray polarimetry is expected to be a powerful tool for astrophysics , offering extra information in addition to x - ray imaging , spectroscopy and timing .",
    "it allows us to probe the magnetic field via synchrotron radiation or test the geometry via scattering , and is capable of testing fundamental physics such as quantum electrodynamics and general relativity under extreme magnetism or gravity @xcite . despite the high demand in astrophysics ,",
    "x - ray polarimetry has been an unexplored area for 40 years since the experiments on the oso-8 satellite @xcite in 1970s , due to the absence of sensitive technology .    along with the development of micro - pattern gas detectors , it has become possible to image the tracks for electrons of a few kev in gas chambers , allowing for sensitive x - ray polarimetry depending on the photoelectric effect using the gas electron multiplier ( gem ) with pixel readout @xcite . compared with other readout techniques",
    ", the gas pixel detector ( gpd ) offers symmetric measurement in the two dimensions and delivers a low systematic error below one per cent even without instrument spinning @xcite .",
    "one of the key elements to the success of the gpd detector is the large - format high - resolution pixel readout chip .",
    "several generations of dedicated asic chips have been developed , reaching to a pixel size of 50 @xmath2 m and a chip size of 1.5 cm @xmath3 1.5 cm ( 105k pixels ) @xcite .",
    "two versions of sealed test chambers , a small one @xcite and a large one @xcite , were designed by the infn - pisa group and assembled by oxford instrument analytical oy .",
    "the major improvement for the large version is that the background induced by the wall of the chamber is reduced and the electric field is more uniform @xcite .    in 2015 , the x - ray imaging and polarimetry explorer ( xipe ) @xcite was approved for phase a study by the european space agency ( esa ) .",
    "it is a space telescope concept dedicated to x - ray polarimetry in response to the call for medium - class missions .",
    "one of our tasks is to build refillable sealed gpd detectors to test and optimize the gas mixture of the detector .",
    "we therefore describe here the assembly of the gpd detectors and some preliminary test results .",
    "the optimization of the gas mixture and related tests of the detector will be reported in follow - up papers .",
    "our work is based on the small version gpd , because it is relatively simple in structure and assembly , and sufficient for testing the gas mixture .",

    "the asic chip @xcite is mounted using low outgassing silver epoxy inside a vacuum tight 304-pin ceramic package , which is soldered onto a printed circuit board ( pcb ) .",
    "the bottom of the chip is connected to the electronic background and the heat from the chip is dissipated into the base of the package and then to the pcb board , where a peltier cooler can be mounted on the other side and multiple via holes are used to increase the thermal conductivity .",
    "the surface of the chip is measured to have an orientation tolerance of less than 20 @xmath2 m with respect to the shoulder of the package using a measuring microscope .",
    "the distance between the chip surface and the package shoulder is 0.8 mm , which is the induction distance between the anode and the bottom layer of the gem .",
    "the gem foil is manufactured by scienergy inc .",
    "it is 50 @xmath2 m thick insulated by liquid crystal polymer ; the laser - etched holes have a diameter of 30 @xmath2 m and a pitch of 50 @xmath2 m in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "four knife - edge clamps are used to apply tensions to the gem foil and a fr4 frame is fixed on it to keep the tension using double sided sticky tape .",
    "the framed gem foil is then placed right above the shoulder of the ceramic package ; the frame is just outside the package and is in the air side so that the choice of its material is not important .",
    "a ceramic spacer of 1 cm thick ( the drift distance ) stands above the gem foil and supports the cap of the chamber , which is a titanium plate with a 17 mm @xmath3 17 mm square hole sealed with a 100 @xmath2 m thick beryllium window , both serving as the cathode of the detector . on the top of the titanium plate , a copper tube with a diameter of 6 mm is mounted for vacuum pumping and gas filling .",
    "all the parts for the main body of the chamber are glued together using low outgassing epoxy and cured at a temperature of 60  @xmath4c .",
    "the copper tube is welded onto the titanium plate and some epoxy is used to further seal the joint . after the chamber is filled with gas , the tube is cut and sealed using ultrasonic welding . to change the gas mixture of the chamber",
    ", we will just cut the copper tube . before filling the gas ,",
    "the detector is pumped and baked for weeks until a vacuum down to @xmath0@xmath5 mbar .",
    "some of the pictures during the assembly process and the final detector are shown in figure  [ fig : assembly ] .",
    "for all the tests in this paper , we adopt a gas mixture of pure dimethyl ether ( dme ) at 0.8 atm , for a direct comparison with previous results @xcite .",

    "a slot on the thick wall of the spacer and a right - angle hole on the titanium cap is machined to connect the copper tube and the inner chamber .",
    "however , such a design creates an asymmetric structure and leads to large non - uniformity for the electric field .",
    "figure  [ fig : maxwell]a shows the intensity map of the electric potential in the middle plane along the drift direction ( @xmath6  mm above the gem top plane ) in the gpd chamber simulated using ansoft maxwell , assuming a voltage of -2740 v on the drift plane and -740 v on the top plane of the gem . as one can see , the electric field is quite uneven toward the tube side . to test the uniformity",
    ", we constructed a narrow beam of x - rays and illuminated the detector at different locations . at positions close to the tube side , the cumulative charge map produced by all the events is elongated , indicative of a distorted electric field ( figure  [ fig : surface]a ) .",
    "the test did not cover the whole sensitive area because the non - uniformity is already obvious and a full coverage takes a huge amount of time .    to correct the field distortion , we changed the design of the interconnection structure .",
    "the spacer wall becomes thinner and stands outside of the right - angle hole in the titanium plate ( figure  [ fig : pipe]b ) .",
    "this makes the ceramic spacer look the same on each face from inside .",
    "the simulated potential map shows that the maximum differential voltage in the middle plane is only 2.4 volt or 0.14% ( figure  [ fig : maxwell]b ) .",
    "the narrow beam test indicates that the charge distribution is no longer elongated or position sensitive ( figure  [ fig : surface]a ) .",
    "the uniformity of the electric field is much improved and such a design is capable of testing the performance of the detector over the whole sensitive area .",

    "thus , the previous low resolution with pure dme is not due to the nature of the gas , rather it could be due to the non - uniformity of the gem gain at different positions , as their beam size is much larger than ours . once filled and sealed , our detector does not show a decline of performance with time , at least on a timescale of a year or so , which will be reported in detail later .",

    "( 2012 ) @xcite should be dominated by statistical errors , because the number of counts we collected is much higher than what they got ( 960k versus 125k ) .",
    "limited by the source intensity , our measurement for the residual modulation covers the whole sensitive area of the detector .",
    "otherwise , it would take too much time to get a meaningful measurement just in the focal point region using our existing setup .",
    "if we extract events in the central region of 3 mm in radius , the residual modulation is @xmath34 constructed from 129k counts , which is dominated by statistical errors .",
    "the imaging performance of our detector is well consistent with that measured by soffitta et al .",
    "( 2013 ) @xcite .",
    "a position resolution of about 80 @xmath2 m in fwhm corresponds to an angular resolution of 4.7 arcsec given a telescope with a focal length of 3.5 m , sufficient to sample the point spread function for the xipe optics which is required to have a angular resolution of less than 30 arcsec .    to conclude , our assembled gpd shows a performance consistent with that of the best ones in previous studies , which will enable us to test and optimize the gas mixture for the phase a study of xipe .",
