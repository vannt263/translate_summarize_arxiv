    "in studying a complex - valued function , it is natural to attempt to locate the zeros of the function ; in fact , one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics asks whether the nontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function @xmath5 lie on a particular line . in this paper",
    ", we study the locations of the zeros of certain modular forms , and show that most of their zeros in a fundamental domain occur on a particular circular arc .    for the eisenstein series , perhaps the easiest examples of modular forms ,",
    "a great deal is known about the locations of the zeros . in the 1960s ,",
    "wohlfahrt  @xcite showed that for even @xmath6 , all zeros of the eisenstein series @xmath7 in the standard fundamental domain for @xmath8 lie on the unit circle @xmath9 , and r. a. rankin  @xcite extended the range of values of @xmath10 for which this holds . shortly afterward , f.k.c .",
    "rankin and swinnerton - dyer  @xcite proved this result for all weights @xmath11 .",
    "rankin  @xcite also obtained the result for certain poincar series , which generalize eisenstein series .",
    "similar results have been obtained for eisenstein series for @xmath12 and @xmath13 by miezaki , nozaki , and shigezumi  @xcite , for eisenstein series for @xmath14 and @xmath15 and for poincar series for @xmath12 and @xmath13 by shigezumi  @xcite , and for a family of eisenstein series for @xmath16 by the first author , long , swisher , and treneer  @xcite .",
    "the above results which locate the zeros of eisenstein series and poincar series use the same general idea of approximating the modular form by an elementary function having the required number of zeros on the arc .",
    "for example , the eisenstein series @xmath7 may be written as a sum over an integer lattice .",
    "when @xmath17 is restricted to the unit circle , so that @xmath18 , the four main terms of this series combine to give @xmath19 .",
    "rankin and swinnerton - dyer s proof shows that the additional terms are small , so the zeros of @xmath7 are close to the zeros of this trigonometric function .    in 1997 , asai , kaneko , and ninomiya  @xcite used this idea to study the zeros of polynomials related to the modular function @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath20 function is a hauptmodul , or an isomorphism from the quotient of the upper half plane @xmath21 under the action of @xmath8 to the complex plane @xmath22 .",
    "it generates all modular functions on @xmath8 , and it also parameterizes the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over @xmath22 . the image of @xmath23 under the hecke operator @xmath24 is a polynomial in @xmath23 , which we write as @xmath25 .",
    "letting @xmath26 be the modular discriminant , which is a weight 12 cusp form on @xmath27 with no zeros in @xmath21 , a generating function for the @xmath25 is given by @xmath28 using this generating function , asai et al .",
    "approximated the polynomials @xmath25 by trigonometric functions well enough to prove that their zeros in the fundamental domain lie on the unit circle .",
    "duke and the second author  @xcite extended the results on @xmath23 to a two - parameter family of modular forms that form bases for spaces of weakly holomorphic modular forms of level 1 . in this case , the connection to elementary functions is less direct .",
    "cauchy s integral formula relates the modular forms to a contour integral of a generalized version of the generating function ( [ jgen ] ) .",
    "an application of the residue theorem produces the elementary functions , and the proof follows by bounding the integral over a range of values for @xmath29 and @xmath17 .",
    "the zeros again lie on the unit circle for many of the forms in the family , though in contrast to previous results , it is known that this property does not hold for all of the modular forms .",
    "we mention one further result using a different technique by hahn  @xcite , who obtained general results on the zeros of eisenstein series for genus zero fuchsian groups ; the general idea is an analogue of the classical argument that shows that the zeros of an orthogonal polynomial all lie on the real line .",
    "this question of locating zeros of modular forms is made even more interesting by results of rudnick  @xcite that showed that the zeros of hecke eigenforms of weight @xmath10 , in a sense the orthogonal complement of the eisenstein series , are expected to become equidistributed in the fundamental domain as @xmath30 .",
    "ghosh and sarnak  @xcite gave a lower bound for the density of zeros lying on certain arcs for such eigenforms . in a different direction , basraoui and sebbar @xcite proved that the quasi - modular form @xmath31 has infinitely many zeros that are inequivalent under @xmath8 , and that none of these lie within the fundamental domain .    in this paper , we examine modular forms in a basis for certain spaces of weakly holomorphic modular forms of arbitrary integral weight and levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we show that for almost all of the basis elements , most of their zeros in a fundamental domain for @xmath34 or @xmath35 lie on a circular arc along the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .",
    "this is possible because we can again approximate these modular forms by elementary functions ; however , the shape of the fundamental domain makes it difficult to accurately locate all of the zeros .",
    "let @xmath36 be the space of holomorphic modular forms of weight @xmath10 for the group @xmath37 , and let @xmath38 be the corresponding space of weakly holomorphic modular forms , or modular forms that are holomorphic on the upper half plane and meromorphic at the cusps .",
    "let @xmath3 be the subspace of @xmath38 consisting of forms which are holomorphic away from the cusp at @xmath2 .",
    "this space appears , for instance , in  @xcite , where it is shown that traces of negative integral weight forms in such a space appear as coefficients of certain half integral weight forms of level @xmath39 .",
    "modular forms in @xmath3 have been studied by ahlgren  @xcite , who gave explicit formulas for the action of the @xmath40-operator on forms in these spaces and obtained formulas for the exponents of their infinite product expansions , and by andersen and the second author  @xcite , who gave congruences for the coefficients of a basis for @xmath41 .    for the group @xmath34 , we use a fundamental domain in the upper half plane bounded by the lines @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the circles of radius @xmath44 centered at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we include the boundary on the left half of this fundamental domain , which is equivalent to the opposite boundary under the action of the matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the cusps of this fundamental domain may be taken to be at @xmath2 and at @xmath49 .",
    "modular forms in @xmath38 with real coefficients demonstrate a nice property on the lower boundary of this fundamental domain . for a fourier series @xmath50 with real fourier coefficients @xmath51 , note that @xmath52 , or @xmath53 .",
    "thus , for modular forms @xmath54 of weight @xmath10 on @xmath34 , if we let @xmath55 for @xmath56 , so that @xmath17 is on the lower boundary of the ( symmetric ) fundamental domain , we find that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 , and the normalized modular form @xmath59 is real valued for @xmath40 between @xmath49 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is useful to define three particular modular forms of level 2 . as usual , let @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the hauptmodul for @xmath34 .",
    "this form has integer coefficients , has a pole at @xmath2 , and vanishes at @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , by the above argument @xmath63 is real - valued on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain , taking on values in @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the special value @xmath65 arises from the relationships between @xmath63 and @xmath23 given by @xmath66 by using the fact that @xmath67 , it is easy to see that @xmath68 must be a common root of the polynomials @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "next , let @xmath71 be the unique normalized holomorphic modular form of weight @xmath32 and level @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the weight 2 eisenstein series @xmath73 .",
    "the form @xmath74 has integer coefficients and a single zero at the elliptic point @xmath75 .",
    "this can be seen by noting that @xmath76 at @xmath77 , so an application of the modular equation yields @xmath78 .",
    "uniqueness comes from applying the valence formula for @xmath34 found in , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we define the eisenstein series @xmath79 as @xmath80 it is easily checked that @xmath81 has integral fourier coefficients and vanishes at @xmath2",
    ". it does not vanish at the cusp at 0 , as the valence formula shows that there are no cusp forms of weight @xmath82 and level @xmath32 .",
    "we now use these forms to construct a basis for @xmath3 . for general even weight @xmath10 , we write @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "a basis for @xmath3 is given by @xmath85 for all integers @xmath86 .",
    "we note that this is an extension of the basis given in  @xcite for @xmath36 ; similar sequences of modular forms for many levels appear in  @xcite .",
    "the basis elements are constructed as follows .",
    "we first define @xmath87 and set @xmath88 .",
    "next , for each @xmath89 we define @xmath90 inductively by multiplying @xmath91 by @xmath63 and subtracting off earlier basis elements .",
    "note that since @xmath81 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 have integral fourier coefficients , each @xmath90 has integral fourier coefficients and is of the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree @xmath96 .",
    "( in fact , @xmath95 is a generalized faber polynomial ; see  @xcite , @xcite . ) thus , if all of the zeros of the basis elements @xmath97 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain , then all of the zeros of the polynomial @xmath95 must lie in the interval @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath90 be as above . if @xmath99 and @xmath100 , or if @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then at least @xmath103 of the @xmath104 nontrivial zeros of @xmath105 in the fundamental domain for @xmath34 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .",
    "we note that the bounds @xmath106 and @xmath102 are not sharp , and that often many more of the zeros lie on the arc .",
    "in fact , for certain weights @xmath10 close to @xmath49 , all of the zeros of all of the @xmath90 are on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain . however , some restriction on @xmath107 in relation to @xmath108 is necessary , as there are also examples of @xmath105 with zeros elsewhere .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ gamma03 ] .",
    "additionally , we obtain similar results for a family of modular forms in @xmath3 whose coefficients are dual to the fourier coefficients of @xmath90 and for a basis for the space @xmath4 , showing that many of the zeros of these modular forms in the appropriate fundamental domain lie on the lower boundary .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows : in section  [ genfn ] , we give a generating function for the basis elements @xmath90 and approximate their values on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain by a trigonometric function .",
    "in section  [ bounds ] we bound the error term to show that most of the zeros lie on the appropriate arc .",
    "section  [ details ] gives technical details on bounds for the error , and in section  [ gamma03 ] we discuss extensions of the main theorem to other modular forms for @xmath34 and to forms for @xmath35 .",
    "in this section we use cauchy s integral formula to relate the basis elements @xmath90 to a trigonometric function . letting @xmath109 , a generating function for the basis elements @xmath90",
    "is given in el - guindy s paper  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) as @xmath110    multiply by @xmath111 and integrate around @xmath112 . changing variables from @xmath113 to @xmath29 and rewriting @xmath114 as a derivative , we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 is some real number larger than @xmath44 .",
    "we move the contour downward , noting that there is a pole whenever @xmath117 is zero , which happens when @xmath29 is equivalent to @xmath17 under the action of @xmath34 .",
    "there are no other poles , since @xmath81 has no zeros in the upper half plane , and if @xmath118 , the zero of @xmath119 is canceled by the zero of @xmath120 .",
    "the closed contour that is the difference between the old integral and the new integral is in the clockwise direction , so we get a factor of @xmath121 in cauchy s integral theorem , and at each pole , we obtain a term of @xmath122 times the residue of the integrand .",
    "if a function @xmath123 has a zero of order @xmath107 at @xmath124 , its logarithmic derivative has a simple pole with residue @xmath107 . in calculating the residue , note that part of the integrand is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath117 , which has a simple zero exactly at the values we are looking at , since @xmath93 is a hauptmodul for @xmath34",
    "this means that the logarithmic derivative of @xmath117 at points equivalent to @xmath17 under @xmath34 will just give us a factor of @xmath125 in the residue .",
    "supposing that @xmath126 for some @xmath127 , this is then multiplied by @xmath128 since the denominator is a modular form of weight @xmath10 on @xmath34 , we have @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and the residue becomes @xmath131 .",
    "assume that @xmath17 is on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain for @xmath34 .",
    "the first two points where @xmath29 is equivalent to @xmath17 through which the contour moves are @xmath132 and @xmath133 . calculating the residues , we find that @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a contour that moves from left to right across the fundamental domain and passes below the points @xmath132 and @xmath136 and above all other points equivalent to @xmath17 under the action of @xmath34 .",
    "we write @xmath137 for some @xmath138 , so that @xmath139 ; then the quantity @xmath140 can be simplified to @xmath141    putting all of this together and multiplying through by @xmath142 , we end up with @xmath143@xmath144 by the argument in section  [ defs ] , the left hand side is a real - valued function of @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the cosine function takes on alternating values of @xmath145 whenever @xmath146 is equal to @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "since this quantity moves from @xmath149 at @xmath150 to @xmath151 at @xmath152 , we know that there must be at least @xmath153 times that this happens .",
    "thus , if we bound the integral term in absolute value by @xmath32 , then by the intermediate value theorem we must have at least @xmath154 zeros of the modular form on this arc .    the dimension of the space of holomorphic modular forms @xmath36 is @xmath155 , and we get at most @xmath156 zeros not at elliptic points for these forms by the general valence formula in  @xcite .",
    "( note that @xmath74 has a zero at @xmath75 , which is already on the arc in question , so @xmath157 has a trivial zero there if @xmath158 . )",
    "counting a pole of order @xmath107 at @xmath2 and no other poles gives us a total of @xmath159 zeros of the basis element @xmath160 whose locations are unknown .",
    "this argument proves that if the weighted modular form is close enough to the cosine function , then all of these zeros must be simple and must be on this arc on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to move the contour down far enough to prove that all of the zeros are on this arc ; as the weight @xmath10 or the order @xmath107 of the pole increases , the contour will need to get closer and closer to @xmath161 if @xmath40 is close to @xmath49 .",
    "recall that for every fixed value of @xmath17 , we need to prove that the integral is bounded by 2 , after moving the contour below that value of @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath17 gets close to the real line , this becomes very difficult  either the contour is not straight and the integral is harder to estimate , as @xmath29 does not have a fixed imaginary part , or the contour must pass through more residues , adding additional terms to the equation .",
    "we can still prove that the majority of the zeros do indeed lie on this arc by choosing a fixed height for the contour , estimating the value of the integral along that contour , and showing that its absolute value is bounded above by @xmath32 .",
    "the goal then is to choose a contour low enough to capture as many zeros as possible , yet high enough to avoid additional residues and to avoid large values inside the integral .",
    "we choose @xmath162 for @xmath163 , so that the contour has constant imaginary part @xmath164 .    for this choice to work , we must also limit the range of @xmath17 , so that our contour passes below @xmath132 and @xmath165 but above other images of @xmath17 under @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath166 for @xmath167 , then @xmath17 has imaginary part @xmath168 , and a contour at a height of @xmath164 picks up residues at @xmath132 and @xmath165 but no other points equivalent to @xmath17 under the action of @xmath34 ; the maximum possible imaginary part of such a point is @xmath169 . in this case , the quantity @xmath170 inside the cosine function has the value @xmath171 at @xmath172 and the value @xmath151 at @xmath173 , and passes through at least @xmath174 multiples of @xmath175 . bounding the integral by @xmath32 for the appropriate @xmath90 will finish the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "in this section we bound @xmath176 for the values @xmath177 with @xmath178 $ ] and @xmath179 with @xmath180 $ ] . we will also give some indication of how this bound might change if we allow @xmath40 to approach @xmath49 and alter the countour accordingly .",
    "details for the computation of the numerical bounds that appear here are provided in the next section .",
    "we seek a bound for @xmath181@xmath182 which is real - valued , by something less than @xmath32 . in absolute value , this integral is @xmath183    consider the exponential term @xmath184 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath185 , so that @xmath186 for @xmath187 $ ] , and this term has exponential decay as @xmath188 ; in this case @xmath189 . if we find an upper bound for the absolute value of the integral , then for large enough @xmath107 the right hand side is indeed less than 2 , and we can apply the intermediate value theorem as desired .",
    "it turns out that we can find a bound for the absolute value that removes the dependence on @xmath107 , but may be exponential in @xmath108 .",
    "however , if @xmath107 is large enough in relation to @xmath108 , then we will see that for a fixed weight @xmath10 , all but finitely many of the @xmath90 have zeros on the appropriate arc .",
    "we note that the absolute value of the integral is certainly bounded above by @xmath190 and already the dependence on @xmath107 has vanished . for the terms involving @xmath81 and @xmath92 , we find an upper bound for the maximum possible value of these terms over the appropriate ranges of @xmath191 and @xmath40 , and pull these upper bounds outside of the integral .",
    "this leaves us with the contribution from @xmath192 which we consider in pieces .",
    "consider first the quantity @xmath193 computations , explained in more detail in the next section , yield @xmath194 as a power series in @xmath195 , we know that @xmath81 has positive coefficients , as seen in .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath196 occurs when @xmath197 , when @xmath195 is real and positive .",
    "heuristically , the minimum value should occur when there is maximum cancelation between terms , or when @xmath195 is real and negative , so that @xmath198 , and we confirm this computationally . decreasing @xmath199 both increases the upper bound , as we are adding larger positive terms , and potentially decreases the lower bound due to cancelation .",
    "heuristically , the maximum value of @xmath200 should occur when @xmath201 is close to @xmath49 , meaning @xmath40 is close to @xmath49 , as here @xmath195 is real , positive , and close to 1 .",
    "similarly , the minimum value of @xmath202 should occur when @xmath201 is close to @xmath203 , meaning @xmath40 is close to @xmath60 ; here @xmath195 is real but negative , so there is extensive cancelation when adding terms . in this case , though , the size of @xmath195 depends on @xmath40 , as we have @xmath204 .",
    "computationally , the minimum indeed occurs at @xmath173 , where @xmath205 .",
    "in general , we have @xmath206 we compute that @xmath207 moving the lower bound on @xmath40 closer to @xmath49 increases the maximum value of @xmath200 , though it does not appear to affect the minimum value .    putting this together",
    ", we have , for @xmath99 , @xmath208 and for @xmath209 , @xmath210 if @xmath118 , this is @xmath211 , which is bounded above by 8.00067 . if @xmath212 , this is @xmath213 , which is bounded above by 12.50005 .",
    "either way , the contribution is no more than 12.50005 .",
    "note that @xmath119 has positive coefficients , and is therefore large when @xmath214 is large .    finally , we consider @xmath215 the hauptmodul @xmath63 is an injective mapping on the fundamental domain ; it is real - valued and strictly decreasing on @xmath216 $ ] .",

    "in contrast , @xmath219 takes on a wide range of values , including some with very large and some with very small modulus . bounding the numerator and denominator",
    "separately yields a trivial upper bound of roughly 79000 , while numerical calculations indicate that the actual maximum is a little larger than 1 .    in order to achieve a sharper bound",

    "@xmath223 it is easier to work with @xmath224 , as we know the numerator is real valued and within a small range , and bounding this quantity proves useful in section  [ gamma03 ] when discussing extensions of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "we will break our path of integration into pieces , and consider @xmath222 in relation to @xmath63 on each . as we know that @xmath63 is real , we consider the real and imaginary parts of @xmath225 separately for @xmath226 $ ] .",

    "altogether , we have @xmath258 . by breaking the integral into pieces ,",
    "we compute more precisely that @xmath259 the relationship in allows us to conclude that @xmath260 we can improve this further by noting that the fact that @xmath261 on @xmath262 $ ] implies that the integrand is bounded by 1 here , yielding @xmath263 we see that if we extend @xmath40 closer to @xmath49 , and hence also decrease @xmath199 , this term has the most potential to blow up near @xmath197 , as this is where @xmath63 and @xmath243 are both small .",
    "additionally , if @xmath56 , then any contour with fixed imaginary part less than @xmath44 , such as @xmath264 , will cross the arc @xmath265 and at least one of its images under @xmath34 , so restricting our @xmath40 values is necessary to avoid a zero in the denominator .",

    "for @xmath209 , we replace @xmath274 with @xmath275 , and find that our integral is bounded by @xmath32 if @xmath276 .",
    "we can then apply the intermediate value theorem to prove that the appropriate number of zeros are on the desired arc .",
    "in the previous section , while bounding our integral we used upper and lower bounds on eisenstein series and the hauptmodul for values on a circular arc on the boundary of the fundamental domain and on a straight line segment . in this section",
    "we justify those bounds .",

    "we bound @xmath279 and @xmath282 separately .",
    "the calculations for the eisenstein series are straightforward , as we have explicit formulas for the fourier coefficients in terms of divisor functions , while calculations for @xmath93 require a little more finesse .",
    "we do not have a nice formula or a sharp bound for the growth rate of the hauptmodul coefficients , and they are quite large , so there are more terms making a significant contribution to the value of the series .",
    "we begin by bounding the values of the eisenstein series , and then use those bounds to tame @xmath63 .    by we have @xmath283 for @xmath284 , we can generously bound @xmath285 by @xmath286 by considering pairs of divisors @xmath287 .",

    "we compute bounds for @xmath335 and @xmath336 by summing @xmath337 for each series .",
    "we find that the bounds are 544.01429 and @xmath338 , respectively .",

    "the bounds for @xmath222 are slightly more difficult . as with lower bounds for the eisenstein series",

    "the maximum possible growth rate for the real part is @xmath345 and the same bound holds for the derivative of the imaginary part .",
    "we again compute values of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath222 at a sampling of points , and use these bounds on the derivatives to find intervals over which the real and imaginary parts of @xmath222 fall within the ranges given in the previous section .",
    "in this section we discuss the sharpness of theorem [ mainthm ] , extend theorem [ mainthm ] to a dual family of weakly holomorphic modular forms for @xmath34 , and consider analogous theorems for families of modular forms for other genus zero subgroups .",
    "we have shown that if @xmath346 is a basis element for the space @xmath3 and @xmath107 is large enough compared to @xmath347 , then the majority of zeros of @xmath90 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain for @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the bounds on @xmath107 are not sharp .",
    "for example , if @xmath348 , then the @xmath349 term in the numerator of the integrand takes on its largest values near @xmath197 , while the @xmath317 term in the denominator takes on its smallest values near @xmath350 , and we have simply taken absolute upper bounds for these functions on the interval @xmath226 $ ] without accounting for interaction between these terms .",
    "it is clear that sharper bounds on @xmath107 are possible , and it is natural to ask if the zeros of @xmath105 always lie on @xmath351 .",
    "in fact , we now exhibit explicit examples for which the zeros are not on this arc .",
    "note that if @xmath212 and the degree @xmath352 of the faber polynomial @xmath95 is equal to @xmath125 , then we can directly compute that @xmath353 .",
    "for the root of this polynomial to be in @xmath98 $ ] , we must have @xmath354 .",
    "thus , if @xmath355 or @xmath356 , the single nontrivial zero of the modular form @xmath357 will not be on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain . if @xmath118 , the analogous polynomial is @xmath358 , and we must have @xmath359 for the zero to be on the lower boundary .",
    "similarly , if @xmath212 and the degree @xmath360 of the polynomial @xmath95 is equal to @xmath32 , we obtain the polynomial @xmath361 , which has complex roots when @xmath362 or @xmath363 .",
    "such calculations can also be done for polynomials of other small degrees to find ranges of @xmath108 and @xmath107 which will not work .",
    "thus , the theorem is not true in general , and some condition on the size of @xmath107 compared to @xmath108 is necessary .",
    "next , we consider a straightforward extension of theorem  [ mainthm ] to obtain results for another family of modular forms for @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath364 , for @xmath365 , be the unique modular form in @xmath3 which vanishes at the cusp @xmath49 and has fourier expansion beginning @xmath366 these @xmath364 form a basis for the subspace of @xmath3 consisting of forms that vanish at @xmath49 . it is straightforward to construct @xmath364 by setting @xmath367 and obtaining the @xmath368 for larger values of @xmath107 inductively by multiplying earlier basis elements by powers of @xmath63 and subtracting the appropriate terms .",
    "these @xmath368 were studied in the @xmath369 case by ahlgren  @xcite , and generating functions for arbitrary even weight @xmath10 were found by el - guindy  @xcite .",
    "we note their similarity to the @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , @xmath370 and replacing @xmath10 with @xmath371 and switching @xmath29 and @xmath17 shows that the @xmath372th fourier coefficient of @xmath90 is equal to the negative of the @xmath107th fourier coefficient of @xmath373 .    with the above generating function",
    ", we can repeat the calculations in section  [ genfn ] , replacing @xmath157 with @xmath374 , to see that the quantity @xmath375 is real valued , and that its difference from @xmath376 is given by an integral almost identical to the integral for the @xmath105 , except that the @xmath222 in the numerator of the integrand becomes a @xmath63 ; hence our hauptmodul expression is the @xmath224 function defined in  . following the argument as before and using the bound for @xmath377 in section  [ bounds ]",
    ", we find that if @xmath99 , the difference is at most @xmath378 , while if @xmath209 , it is at most @xmath379 .",
    "we obtain the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath364 be as above . if @xmath99 and @xmath380 , or if @xmath101 and @xmath381 , then at least @xmath382 of the @xmath383 nontrivial zeros of @xmath384 in the fundamental domain for @xmath34 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .    finally , we consider extensions of this method to other subgroups .",
    "consider @xmath385 .",
    "if @xmath386 , then this is a genus zero subgroup with two inequivalent cusps and with hauptmodul @xmath387 it is again possible to define analogous families @xmath388 and @xmath389 for these groups , and to use  @xcite to find a generating function for each family that mirrors .",
    "moreover , given a modular form @xmath54 of level @xmath278 with real coefficients , we find that the quantity @xmath390 is real for @xmath391 ; this is a natural place to look for zeros .",
    "our argument for the case @xmath392 relied on the ability to find a particular horizontal contour meeting certain criteria . if we can find a contour passing below the points @xmath393 and @xmath394 and above all other images of @xmath17 under the action of @xmath1 , then an application of cauchy s residue theorem to the generating function shows that @xmath395 is equal to @xmath396 times the integral of the generating function along this contour .",
    "if we take the absolute value of the latter expression , then choosing a contour with horizontal height @xmath397 means we can pull @xmath398 outside of the integral , and as long as @xmath399 , this term has exponential decay as @xmath107 grows .",
    "this means that any bound on the size of the remaining integral term proves a result for the location of some of the zeros of @xmath400 for large enough @xmath107 .",
    "we let @xmath403 for @xmath404 , and for @xmath405 we define a basis for @xmath4 by letting @xmath406 be the unique element of @xmath4 with fourier expansion beginning @xmath407 .",
    "we let @xmath408 , and require the height of the contour to be above @xmath409 to avoid any images of @xmath17 other than @xmath410 .",
    "we restrict the range of @xmath40 values so that @xmath17 and @xmath410 lie above this contour . the contour may be as close to @xmath409 as we like , and we may allow @xmath17 to come as close to the contour as we like ; once we fix these choices , the integral will have a finite upper bound , and the exponential term will eventually dominate when @xmath411 for some constant @xmath135 , so that the difference between the weighted modular form @xmath406 and the cosine function is less than @xmath32 .",
    "the number of zeros of @xmath406 in the fundamental domain is @xmath412 , and as the contour approaches a height of @xmath409 and @xmath17 is allowed to approach the contour , the number of zeros that can be proved to be on the lower boundary approaches @xmath413 .",
    "thus , we have the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath406 be as above . if @xmath107 is large enough compared to @xmath108 , then the majority of the zeros of @xmath406 in the fundamental domain for @xmath35 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain ."
