    "einstein condensate are identical by comparing the one- and two - particle green s functions in their diagrammatic structures of simple perturbation expansions .",
    "the spectra at long wavelengths were also identified as phonons with a linear dispersion , in agreement with previous studies by bogoliubov @xcite and beliaev@xcite on the one - particle excitations in the weak - coupling regime . according to the gavoret ",
    "nozires theory,@xcite we may regard collective modes observed by inelastic neutron scattering@xcite in superfluid @xmath0he@xcite as qualitatively identical to the bogoliubov mode.@xcite together with the hugenholtz  pines theorem,@xcite their result has been accepted widely as forming a microscopic foundation for elementary excitations of interacting bose ",
    "einstein condensates.@xcite    a question on this was raised recently,@xcite however , on the basis of an analysis of the relevant diagrammatic structures by an alternative self - consistent perturbation expansion,@xcite which has a plausible feature of satisfying the hugenholtz  pines theorem@xcite and conservation laws@xcite simultaneously .",
    "it was shown that the single - particle - like line in the two - particle bethe ",
    "salpeter equation , which is characteristic of condensation , can not be identified with the one - particle green s function due to extra terms in the `` self - energy '' part,@xcite contrary to the conclusion by gavoret and nozires.@xcite furthermore , the difference in the self - energies was predicted to manifest itself in the lifetimes of the quasiparticles ( one - particle modes ) and collective modes ( two - particle modes ) . to be specific , the collective modes are long - lived with lifetimes that approach infinity in the long - wavelength limit , whereas the quasiparticles should have much shorter lifetimes as they are bubbling into and out of the condensate dynamically.@xcite    with this background , we here perform an independent study as to which of the contradictory conclusions is correct .",
    "the moment method may be suitable for this purpose . for interacting systems , it is generally practically impossible to calculate dynamical quantities relevant to excitation spectra exactly , such as the dynamic structure factor@xcite @xmath1 and the one - particle spectral function @xmath2 .",
    "however , we can sometimes obtain reliable results for their moments , which are much easier to handle but nevertheless provide sufficient information to construct excitation spectra .",
    "indeed , studying the first moment of @xmath1 has proved useful for elucidating the collective - mode spectra of such noteworthy systems as superfluid @xmath0he@xcite and the fractional quantum hall states.@xcite we extend this approach up to the second - order moment and also apply it to @xmath2 so as to compare the spectral peaks and lifetimes between the one- and two - particle excitations .",
    "this amounts to generalizing the bijl ",
    "feynman formula@xcite for the peak of @xmath1 to the spectral width and also to the single - particle channel .",
    "we subsequently perform a numerical study based on the lowest - order constrained variational ( locv ) method@xcite to ( i ) optimize the jastrow wave function@xcite for the ground state , ( ii ) use it to calculate the first and second moments of the quasiparticle and collective - mode spectra numerically by the monte carlo method , and ( iii ) compare their peaks and widths for our purpose .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this issue also has direct relevance to the understanding and characterization of goldstone bosons.@xcite specifically , goldstone s theorem was proved in two different manners,@xcite which generally have been regarded as identical . on the other hand , the first and second proofs in the context of single - component bose ",
    "einstein condensates correspond to the one- and two - particle channels , respectively.@xcite hence , whether the two excitations are the same or not concerns the fundamental question of whether the two proofs of goldstone s theorem are identical or not .",
