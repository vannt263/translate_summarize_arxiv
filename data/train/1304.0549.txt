    "the origin of the magnetic fields inside the star is not still understood well . according to the recent progresses of the theoretical researches ,",
    "there are two possibilities for the mechanism to generate and sustain magnetic fields , i.e. 1 ) the dynamo theory and 2 ) the fossil field theory ( see the review by @xcite ) . stars which have convective regions regenerate and sustain the magnetic fields by the dynamo mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , a , b , o stars have a convective core where dynamo action develops ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the timescale for the dynamo - generated field in this core to reach the surface is too long ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the magnetic field observed at the stellar surface is supposed to be fossil field .",
    "recent observations show the observed magnetic fields properties confirm this hypothesis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , it has long been considered that magnetic fields of such stars would come from fossil magnetic fields . according to the fossil field theory ,",
    "the magnetic fields of such stars would be originated from magnetized interstellar media .",
    "if the magnetic fluxes would be conserved during star formation processes , the magnetic fields could be concentrated to smaller regions of the stars by the gravitational contraction and result in strong magnetic fields inside the stars .",
    "since the electric conductivities of the stars are very large , those magnetic fields do not diffuse during their formation stages . as for neutron stars ,",
    "the origin of their strong magnetic fields is much more uncertain .",
    "if the fossil field theory could be applied , the strong magnetic fields could be reached by the same mechanism as those mentioned above for stars without external convective regions .",
    "on the other hand , if we could adopt the dynamo theory , the strong magnetic fields would be formed by the dynamo due to the rapid differential rotations in the convective regions of the proto - neutron stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the differential rotations could wind up the initial poloidal magnetic fields to produce strong toroidal magnetic fields before the crusts would crystallize . in either case",
    ", the magnetic fields of neutron stars would be present even at birth and survive in much longer timescales than the alfvn timescale ( @xmath1 s for typical neutron stars with magnetic fields of order of @xmath2 g ) . here",
    "@xmath3 is the radius of the stellar surface which is , for axisymmetric configurations , a function of @xmath4 of the polar coordinates @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 . in order to sustain these kinds of fossil magnetic fields for a long time",
    ", these magnetic fields must be stationary and stable .",
    "thus , in order to understand the magnetic fields originated from the fossil fields , it would be useful and important to get stationary and stable configurations of magnetized stars .",
    "as for stability , analytic studies have shown that any configurations with either purely poloidal or purely toroidal magnetic fields are unstable ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stable magnetized stars should have both the poloidal and the toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the magnitudes of the toroidal fields must be comparable with those of the poloidal fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "this argument has been shown to be the case from the recent simulations .",
    "@xcite have shown that an initial random magnetic field in stably stratified stellar layers relaxes on the stable twisted - torus magnetic field configuration after several alfvn timescale .",
    "similar twisted - torus magnetic field configurations have been also obtained in many previous works by numerically exact computations of the axisymmetric stationary states of magnetized stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , structure separated grad - shafranov ( gs ) solving method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or zero - flux - boundary method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the stabilities of these fields , however , have not been clarified yet because it is difficult to analyze their stability by linear stability analyses or other means based on the stationary configurations . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that the stability criteria of the magnetized stars could be expressed as below : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of the magnetic energy to the gravitational energy ( see appendix [ app : physics ] ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the ratio of the poloidal magnetic energy to the total magnetic energy and @xmath10 is a certain dimensionless factor of order 10 for main - sequence stars and of order @xmath11 for neutron stars .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is about @xmath13 even for magnetars and is expected to be @xmath14 for other real stars .",
    "thus the left hand side of this inequality could be less than about @xmath15 even if the value of @xmath10 might be @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , this criterion means the configurations with the twisted torus magnetic fields are stable even if the toroidal magnetic fields are much stronger than the poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast , the right hand side of this inequality means that the strong poloidal magnetic field configurations are unstable ( we define that the poloidal fields are strong when @xmath17 in this paper ) . as shown in dynamical simulations mentioned above , configurations with the strong poloidal magnetic fields are likely to become unstable within several alfvn timescales .",
    "this criteria would not be applied to all situations because we might be able to consider various kinds of magnetic field configurations as the initial states and different choices of the initial conditions might influence on the evolutions of the magnetic fields .",
    "however , it seems to be the case that there is a tendency to become more unstable even for the twisted - torus magnetic field configurations with larger poloidal magnetic field energies .",
    "therefore , it would be a natural consequence to consider that there would be stable magnetized stars with strong toroidal magnetic fields which satisfy the condition @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy of the toroidal field .    on the other hand , the majority of investigations in which stationary states of the magnetized stars have been treated ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) failed to obtain configurations with strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "in these studies , stationary states of magnetized stars have been pursued either by numerically exact methods ( e.g. @xcite ) or structure separated gs solving methods ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , they have only found that it was very difficult to obtain stationary states of magnetized stars with very strong toroidal magnetic fields . in some of their solutions",
    "the toroidal magnetic fields have been almost as strong as the poloidal magnetic fields only in the particular local regions inside the stars , but the total energies of the toroidal magnetic fields as a whole are much smaller than those of the total poloidal magnetic fields . in other words ,",
    "the ratios of @xmath9 in their solutions are much bigger than 0.8 .",
    "by contrast , some studies of magnetized stationary configurations by structure separated gs solving method ( @xcite ) by zero - flux - boundary method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have succeeded in obtaining the magnetized equilibria with strong toroidal magnetic fields by choosing very special boundary conditions for the poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "the boundary condition adopted by @xcite and @xcite in which they failed to obtain configurations with strong toroidal magnetic fields is that the poloidal magnetic field lines should continue smoothly through the stellar surfaces into the vacuum region which is considered to be outside of the stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary condition employed by @xcite is different .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field lines need not continue smoothly at the stellar surfaces , because in some of their models it has been allowed for the surface currents to exist . by specifying such a boundary condition , they have succeeded in finding that magnetized configurations whose total energies of the toroidal magnetic fields become much stronger as the surface currents are increased .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also obtained the stationary configurations with strong toroidal magnetic fields , but the boundary condition which they adopted is of different kind from those mentioned above .",
    "their assumptions are essentially the same as those in the previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they imposed the boundary condition that the magnetic flux on the stellar surfaces should vanish , so all of poloidal field lines are closed and confined inside the stars and no poloidal magnetic fields penetrate to the vacuum region outside of stars . in their solutions , the region where the toroidal magnetic fields exist inside the star is much larger than that of any other models .",
    "however , they did not explain the reason why the magnetized stars can sustain such configurations with large toroidal magnetic energies under their special boundary condition .    in this paper we will deal with magnetized configurations with large amount of the magnetic energies in the toroidal fields and",
    "present the reason why the magnetized stars can sustain strong toroidal magnetic fields within the stars .",
    "as will be shown , we have found that the total currents of the magnetized stars are important keys to understand this problem systematically and the values of the total currents seem to be deeply related to the boundary condition of the magnetic fields .",
    "it should be noted that for the stationary configurations the magnetic fields are governed by the grad - shafranov equation which is of the elliptic type partial differential equation for the magnetic flux function .",
    "therefore , the solutions of the gs equation are necessarily strongly depending on the boundary condition(s ) .    in this paper , we use both the numerically exact non - force - free method ( @xcite ) and the method in which boundary conditions are applied at finite locations from the stellar centre ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will show configurations with negative surface currents or with the regions where the current become negative can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic fields inside the star .",
    "here the term negative means that the currents flow in the opposite direction to the flow direction of the bulk of the interior currents .",
    "our formulation of the problem  and the numerical methods are essentially the same as that of @xcite , i.e. the numerically exact method , and that of @xcite , i.e. the zero - flux - boundary method .",
    "we calculate self - gravitating , axisymmetric , stationary magnetized stars in order to obtain magnetized equilibria with strong toroidal fields in the newtonian gravity .",
    "we assume that the system is in a stationary and axisymmetry state . for rotating stars , the rotational axis and the magnetic axis coincide and",
    "the rotation is assumed to be rigid .",
    "the star has no meridional flows .",
    "the conductivity of the stellar matter is infinite , i.e. the ideal mhd approximation is employed .",
    "there is no magnetosphere around the star .",
    "in other words , no electric current exists in the vacuum region . therefore , the toroidal magnetic field is confined within the star and the only poloidal component can penetrate the surface and extend to the outside of the star .",
    "we use the polytropic equation of state as below : @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pressure , the mass density , the polytropic constant and the polytropic index , respectively .",
    "we fix @xmath26 for simplicity when we compute stationary configurations by using the numerically exact method .",
    "this choice of @xmath25 is the same as that adopted in the previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce the magnetic flux function @xmath27 in order to obtain magnetized equilibria efficiently .",
    "the magnetic flux function is defined as below : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the components of the magnetic field in the @xmath31-direction and the @xmath4-direction , respectively . using the flux function @xmath27 , we derive the grad - shafranov equation from maxwell equations as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath0-component of the current and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the magnetic flux function @xmath27  can be expressed as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath0-component of the vector potential which satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "the form of grad - shafranov equation can be rewritten as : @xmath38 where , @xmath39 denotes the ordinary laplacian operator .",
    "this equation seems strange because the system treated in this paper is axisymmetric and @xmath0-dependency would not appear .",
    "the reason why we introduce the term @xmath40 is that by introducing the @xmath40 term we can get an equation which contains the three dimensional laplacian operator as shown above .",
    "the tree dimensional laplacian operator which emerges by this seemingly strange device allows us to transform the equation into an integral form as shown below . by taking the boundary condition for the vector potential into account and using green s function which satisfies the boundary condition",
    ", we derive the integral form of the gs equation as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a homogeneous general solution to eq.([eq : poisson_a ] ) as follows : @xmath43 p_n^1 ( \\cos \\theta ) .",
    "\\label{eq : homogenous}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath44 is a certain constant which is the stellar radius for spherical configurations , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constant coefficients which are obtained by applying the boundary condition",
    ". we will be able to obtain the stationary distributions of the magnetic vector potentials by solving this equation .",
    "since these equations are of elliptic type partial differential equations whose source term is @xmath47 , the boundary conditions are very important and have significant influences on the global structures of the vector potentials or the magnetic flux functions",
    ". we will deal with this problem about the boundary condition in sec .",
    "[ sec : surface_current ] .",
    "once we have obtained the flux function by solving the gs equation , it is easy to calculate the poloidal magnetic fields directly . on the other hand ,",
    "we can obtain the toroidal component of the magnetic field by using the conserved quantity along the flux function which can be expressed by an arbitrary function of @xmath27 .",
    "this arbitrary function appears because of the assumption of the axisymmetry .",
    "this function is called @xmath48 in @xcite , @xmath49 in @xcite and @xmath50 in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we name it @xmath48 after @xcite .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field is obtained from the following relation @xmath51 this arbitrary function also appears in the expression of the current density as follows : @xmath52 where , @xmath53 is another arbitrary function of @xmath27 .",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath53 is the same as @xmath54 in @xcite and @xmath49 in @xcite .",
    "then , we express the @xmath0 component of the current density as below : @xmath55 the first term of eq.([eq : current_phi ] ) is the force - free current density part and the second term is the non - force - free current part because of @xmath56 . if @xmath57 in a certain region , the magnetic field there is force - free , because @xmath58 in that region .",
    "we will call the first term as the @xmath59 term , and the second term as the @xmath60 term of the current density in this paper . in a naive treatment",
    ", it seems to be enough to make the contribution from the @xmath59 term larger in order to make the toroidal magnetic fields larger .",
    "however , it has been very difficult to make the influence from the @xmath59 term strong .",
    "the reason for that is as follows .",
    "the distribution of @xmath27 is obtained by solving the gs equation , but the source term of the gs equation contains the @xmath59 term which is an arbitrary function of @xmath27 and is confined to a restricted region in the interior of the star because we impose the magnetic flux function to be _ smoothly _ connected on the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , if we change the functional form and values of parameters which appear in the functional form of @xmath59 as well as the the region where @xmath59 does not vanish , the distribution of the flux function also changes according to the changes of @xmath59 .",
    "we will discuss this difficulty in sec.[subsec : no_surface_current_model ] .",
    "in this section , we deal with the relation between the surface current and the magnetic field , which is deeply influenced by the boundary conditions .",
    "the surface current can be defined either by the discontinuity of the derivative of the magnetic flux function , or by the homogeneous term in the integral representation for the vector potential .",
    "the both definitions for the surface current give exactly the same values as we will see later .",
    "at first , we will show a relation between the surface current and the discontinuity of the magnetic field as follows .",
    "if the ampre s equation is applied to an area @xmath61 bounded by a boundary @xmath62 , we can write it by an integral form as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are a line element and a surface element , respectively .",
    "we apply this equation to an infinitely small area in the meridional plane of the star bounded by four lines as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are a constant , infinitesimal widths in the @xmath31-direction and in the @xmath4-directions , respectively . for this infinitesimal area",

    "if the current density is a surface current on the stellar surface @xmath73 defined by @xmath74 , we can integrate the equation as below    @xmath75    since the @xmath31 dependence of the magnetic fields are continuous on the stellar surface ( @xmath76 ) , we obtain a relation as follows : @xmath77 the surface current is expressed by the discontinuity of the @xmath4-component of the magnetic field . for more general situations ,",
    "we can obtain the following equation for the surface current using the parallel component @xmath78 to the stellar surface , @xmath79 if the surface current exits , the parallel component of the magnetic field must be discontinuous .",
    "we emphasize that the value of the discontinuity of the magnetic field between just inside and just outside of the stellar surface equals the surface current density .",
    "@xcite expressed the surface current density in a different way as follows .",
    "they defined the surface current by imposing the discontinuity of poloidal magnetic fields at the stellar surface ( see eq.67 in @xcite ) .",
    "their discontinuous boundary condition is just an _ assumption _ without a firm foundation as follows : @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 indicate the magnetic field and a discontinuity parameter , respectively , in their paper .",
    "since their model is a purely dipole configuration , the exterior solution of @xmath83 is @xmath84 ( eq.61 in @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 indicate the @xmath31-component of the flux function and the dimensionless radius normalized by the stellar radius",
    ". then we can calculate the distribution of their surface current density as follows , @xmath87_{(x=1 ) } = - j_0 \\sin \\theta , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88_{(x=1)}.\\ ] ] since they calculated only models with @xmath89 in their paper , the surface current density of their models flows in the opposite direction to the interior bulk toroidal current density inside the star .",
    "in other words their surface current is negatively flowing with respect to the bulk interior currents . according to @xcite ,",
    "if the value for the discontinuity for the poloidal magnetic field is increased , the energy of the toroidal magnetic fields becomes larger ( see fig .",
    "5 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the negative surface current sustain strong toroidal magnetic fields comparing with those in tomimura & eriguchi models without surface currents .      using the integral representation for the vector potential",
    ", we can see the surface current from a different point of view .",
    "we assume that a magnetized star has no currents in the stellar interior except for the surface current .",
    "it implies that the source term for the gs equation consists only of the surface current .",
    "we can obtain the magnetic field by calculating eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_j_phi ] ) , @xmath90 since the surface current exists on the stellar surface @xmath91 , we can describe the surface current density using the dirac s delta function : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the surface current which flows along the surface .",
    "we can expand and integrate eq.([eq : c1 ] ) using the legendre functions and the axisymmetry of the system .",
    "we obtain the solutions for @xmath94 as follows : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a function defined by @xmath97 now we calculate the vector potential and the magnetic field by giving a @xmath98-distribution for the surface current density .",
    "we assume the @xmath4-distribution of the surface current can be expressed by the expansion using legendre functions , @xmath99 where @xmath100 s are dimensionless coefficients related to the @xmath101th associate legendre function @xmath102 .",
    "then using the orthogonality among the legendre functions,@xmath103 we can obtain an analytically expressed solutions as follows : @xmath104 and @xmath105 if we set @xmath106 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : aphi_anal ] ) is exactly the same as homogeneous general solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : homogenous ] ) . therefore , adding the homogeneous term to the inhomogeneous solution of the gs equation corresponds exactly to adding the surface current at the boundary surface .    fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole_quadrupole ] shows the poloidal magnetic field lines for configurations with the purely dipole ( @xmath107 ) surface current ( left panel ) and with the purely quadrupole ( @xmath108 ) surface current ( right panel ) .",
    "it should be noted that each model has no interior currents except for the surface currents as we have described in this section .",
    "we will show numerically exact structures of magnetized stars with open field lines and with / without surface currents in this section . at first , we will display configurations which have no surface currents .",
    "although they are the same as those obtained in @xcite and @xcite , we will check these models from a different point of view , i.e. in the context of the influence of the surface currents .",
    "next , magnetized stars which have surface currents will be treated and discussed .      as discussed before ,",
    "we have solved the integral equation derived from the gs equation by considering the presence of the surface currents as follows : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the surface current density of the magnetized star .",
    "we choose the following two different distributions for the surface currents : @xmath111 and @xmath112 as for the arbitrary functions appearing in our formulation , we choose the following forms : @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 here , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constant parameters and @xmath119 means the maximum value of @xmath27 in the vacuum region . in this paper , we fix @xmath120 . these functional forms and",
    "the value of @xmath117 are the same as those chosen in other papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this section",
    ", we set the polytropic index @xmath26 ( e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the ratio of the polar radius to the equatorial radius defined by ( see @xcite ) @xmath123 concerning the angular velocity @xmath124 , we choose values of @xmath125e-2 for rigidly rotating configurations and @xmath126 for non - rotating models . here",
    "quantities with @xmath127 represent the corresponding ones transformed into dimensionless forms as shown in appendix [ app : dimensionless ] ( see also @xcite ) . although the equations of state influence the strengths of the toroidal magnetic fields ( see @xcite ) , we have treated only @xmath128 polytropes because the main concern in this paper is how the surface current density affects the distributions of the magnetic fields , in particular to the toroidal magnetic fields . in order to examine the accuracies of solutions ,",
    "we have used the virial relation as shown in appendix [ app : vc ] .",
    "since the value of @xmath129 affects the local behavior of the toroidal magnetic field distributions , in particular on its maximum value ( see @xcite ) , we have solved the magnetized configurations by changing the value of @xmath129 for two values of @xmath130 .",
    "obtained results are plotted in fig.[fig : mp_m0 ] which shows the ratio of @xmath9 against @xmath129 . as seen from this figure",
    ", there is a minimum value of the ratio .",
    "it implies that the toroidal magnetic field energy increases to its maximum value at @xmath131 for non - rotating configurations and at @xmath132 for rigidly rotating models . since the term related to the rotation does not appear in the current density formula ( see eq.[eq : current ] ) , the rotation affects the toroidal magnetic field distributions only slightly .",
    "therefore , we will display and discuss only configurations with rotation in the following part of this section .    in many investigations which have been done by applying numerically exact methods or by structure separated gs solving method zero - flux - boundary methods , almost similar results as ours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mp_m0 ] have been obtained ( see table 2 in @xcite , fig . 12 in @xcite , fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , this behavior of the toroidal magnetic field against the value of @xmath133 is likely to be a general feature of stationary magnetized stars which have open magnetic fields .    in order to consider the reason of the presence of these minimum values , in fig.[fig : h_r_j_r_jsur0 ] shown are the distributions of the magnetic field components ( left panels ) and those of the two components of the current density formula ( right panels ) .",
    "different curves in the left panels mean @xmath134 ( dotted line ) , @xmath135(dashed line ) and @xmath136(solid line ) distributions for the region @xmath137 $ ] . in the right panels ,",
    "the solid line denotes the force - free @xmath59 term and the dashed line denotes the non - force - free @xmath60 term in the current density formula .    as seen from these panels , by increasing the value of @xmath129 , which corresponds to increasing the maximum strength of the toroidal magnetic field , from top panels to bottom panels , we can find that the width of the toroidal magnetic field region becomes narrower .",
    "the values of the toroidal magnetic field energy seem to depend on the distributions of the toroidal magnetic fields and of the current densities , in particular , on the maximum value and the width of the toroidal magnetic field distribution . although the maximum value of the @xmath59 term of the current density increases with @xmath129 , its width becomes narrower as @xmath129 is increasing .",
    "it implies that the slope of the distribution of the @xmath59 term becomes steeper for the large value of the current density .",
    "this tendency is also seen in the distribution of @xmath138 .",
    "by contrast with this , the distributions of the @xmath60 term are almost the same because we fix @xmath122 and @xmath130 which are related to the characteristic nature of the non - force - free magnetic fields .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) and our numerical results , we can find that in order to sustain strong toroidal magnetic fields ( appearing in the right hand side of the equation ) , the strong toroidal current density ( appearing in the left hand side of the equation ) is required .",
    "it should be noted that the strength of the toroidal magnetic field seems to be related deeply to the strength of the total current density .",
    "this can be seen from the following argument .",
    "we introduce several definitions about integrated currents as follows : @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the meridional plane which is perpendicular to the @xmath0-coordinate and @xmath141 is an area element in the meridional plane . here , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 the @xmath0-component of the positively flowing interior current density , the @xmath0-component of the negatively flowing interior current density , the @xmath59 term of the current density and the @xmath60 term .",
    "furthermore , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the total _ positive _ bulk interior current , the total _ negative _ bulk interior current , the total @xmath59 term bulk interior current , the total @xmath60 term bulk interior current , the total surface current and the total ( bulk + surface ) current in the meridional plane , respectively .",
    "as we shall see , these quantities will play key roles to understand the problem .        in fig.[fig : j_phi_j_tot ] , the total current , the total @xmath60 current and the total @xmath59 current of the star is plotted against @xmath129 .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : j_phi_j_tot ] that the total current does not increase as @xmath118 increases and the total @xmath59 current increases to its maximum value near at @xmath152 .",
    "we will denote the maximum value of the total current as @xmath153 in this paper .",
    "this @xmath129 value is the same as that for the minimum value of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore it is important to note that there is an upper bound of the total current for configurations if we consider a stationary sequence with different values of @xmath129 .",
    "this upper bound comes from our boundary condition for the current density .",
    "since we have imposed that the outside of the star is vacuum , the current density needs to vanish in that vacuum region .",
    "as we have seen , the magnetized stars need large and strong toroidal currents in order to sustain strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "however , the boundary condition sets limit to the total current of the star as seen from fig.[fig : j_phi_j_tot ] . as a result , the region where the current density attains a rather large value becomes smaller and the slope of the distribution of the current density becomes steeper in order to sustain the stronger toroidal magnetic field in the narrower region .",
    "moreover , larger values of @xmath129 cause the maximum value of the magnetic flux function in the _ vacuum _ region larger , in general .",
    "as far as our boundary condition for the magnetic flux function to be smooth at the stellar surface is employed , the support of the @xmath59 function becomes smaller and smaller as the value of @xmath129 is increased .",
    "in other words , increasing the value of @xmath129 might , in ordinary situations , result in increasing the interior currents but at the same time decreasing the support region of the function @xmath59 because the maximum value of the magnetic flux function in the vacuum region also becomes larger as explained before .",
    "this is the reason why in the present investigation as well as in other works thus far done nobody could obtain solutions which exceed this upper bound . to overcome this limitation about the size of the confined region of the large toroidal magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetized stars needs other kinds of distributions for the toroidal current densities .    from these consideration ,",
    "we need to devise some means to fulfill the following seemingly contradicted requirements at the same time .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath0-currents must be increased . in ordinary situations",
    ", this would results in reducing the support region of the function @xmath59 because of the increase of the maximum value of the magnetic flux function in the vacuum .",
    "( 2 ) the support region for the function must be widened . in ordinary situations ,",
    "the support region of the function @xmath59 is wider for the smaller values of @xmath118 .    these two seemingly contradictory requirements could be realized by introducing _ negatively flowing _ currents near / on the surface",
    "because the negatively flowing currents allow the positively flowing interior currents to become larger and at the same time negatively flowing currents near / on the surface could reduce the value of the magnetic flux function in the vacuum region and result in the smaller value for @xmath154 .                      as explained in the previous subsection , in order to exceed the upper bound of @xmath151 found in this paper and to reduce the value of @xmath154 , we will try to investigate the magnetized stars which contain oppositely flowing surface toroidal currents against the interior bulk currents which are flowing in a certain direction .",
    "we will call such oppositely flowing currents as _ negative _ currents , hereafter . in short",
    ", we will assume that there could be toroidal surface currents which flow to the negative direction compared to the flow direction of the interior main currents which we will call the _ interior bulk _ currents .",
    "in fact the effects of the presence of the oppositely flowing surface currents are similar to those of the boundary conditions treated in section 5.2 of @xcite as we have shown in sec.[sec : j_sur_diff ] .",
    "as we shall show , magnetized stars with negative surface currents will be able to sustain much stronger interior bulk currents and have much stronger toroidal magnetic fields because the oppositely flowing surface current cancels the effects of the interior toroidal currents to certain extent and results in configurations which have the following two special characteristics .    1 .   in such configurations ,",
    "although the total currents @xmath151 are below the upper bound @xmath155 discussed before , much stronger positive interior bulk currents @xmath146 are allowed to exist .",
    "2 .   at the same time , in such configurations , the absolute values of the magnetic flux function in the outer vacuum region can become smaller than those of configurations without negatively flowing surface currents .",
    "thus the support region for the arbitrary function @xmath48 can become wider than that for configurations without surface currents .    in this subsection , as an example , the dipole - like distribution for the surface current as eq.([eq : j_sur_dip ] )",
    "is employed . if the magnetized stars are purely spherical with no interior currents within the stars , dipole - like surface currents result in uniformly distributed interior magnetic fields and purely dipole exterior magnetic fields ( see fig.[fig : dipole_quadrupole ] ) .",
    "thus , if the surface current densities are much stronger than the interior current densities , the interior magnetic fields become almost uniform and there are no closed magnetic fields inside of the stars .",
    "the toroidal magnetic fields could not appear in such configurations .",
    "we have calculated many stationary configurations with surface currents for several values of @xmath129 . as a result",
    ", we found that a model with @xmath156 has the smallest value of @xmath9 in all our stationary solutions .",
    "thus we will show only configurations with @xmath156 in this paper , but it should be noted that all other models show almost the same tendency as that of configurations with @xmath156 which we will describe below",

    "in these models , there is no negative current @xmath158 in the star .",
    "therefore , @xmath159 and @xmath160 in these configurations . from this figures",
    ", we can see that if we increase the value of @xmath157 , the total bulk current of the magnetized star , @xmath146 , becomes larger ( fig.[fig : j0_2 ] ) and the value of @xmath9 becomes smaller ( fig.[fig : j0 ] ) .",
    "we can see from left panel of fig.[fig : j0_2 ] that the total current @xmath151 is almost the same as the upper bound of the total current @xmath155 defined before .",
    "however , the total positive current @xmath146 becomes much larger than this upper bound .",
    "especially noted from the right panel in fig.[fig : j0_2 ] , the total @xmath59 current term becomes much larger and the total @xmath60 current term becomes slightly small .",
    "this can be considered as an evidence that the negative surface current cancels some contributions of the positively flowing interior toroidal current from the @xmath59 term current .",
    "it is remarkable that the value of @xmath9 attains about 0.7 when @xmath161 .",
    "it implies that the magnitude of the toroidal magnetic field energy is almost the same order as that of the poloidal magnetic energy for those models around @xmath161 .",
    "the ratio @xmath162 seems to be the minimum value in the present parameter space because we could not succeed in obtaining numerical solutions when @xmath163 .",
    "since the surface current with @xmath164 should be considered tremendously strong , their fields would become nearly uniform in the interior and purely dipole in the outside of the star by the surface current as seen fig.[fig : dipole_quadrupole ] .",
    "moreover , when there are no closed poloidal magnetic field lines inside the stars , the magnetized stars can not have toroidal magnetic fields because the poloidal magnetic fields are originated from the closed current densities which are assumed to be parallel to the closed poloidal magnetic fields as seen from the current density formula .    fig .",

    ", we can see both the width and the strength of the @xmath59 term are increasing as @xmath157 , but that the strength of the @xmath60 term does not change so much .",
    "this result means that the oppositely flowing surface current affects only the force - free term in the current density formula significantly . as discussed before , since the @xmath60 term is non - force - free and affected mainly from the global structures of the stars , i.e. by the value of the axis ratio @xmath122 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath60 term in the current density formula would not show large change .",
    "we have computed these configurations by fixing the values of @xmath122 and @xmath130 and the total magnetic strengths of the stars are nearly the same for the different configurations .",
    "therefore , the distributions of the @xmath60 terms are nearly the same for different values of @xmath157 .",

    "the oppositely flowing surface current density can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the maximum value of the toroidal magnetic field and the size of the region where the most of the toroidal magnetic field exists can be increased by adding and increasing the surface current densities .    in fig.[fig",

    "the value of the magnetic flux function at the equatorial surface for the configuration without surface current becomes bigger as the @xmath129 increases , because the maximum value of the flux function becomes bigger .",
    "on the other hand , the value of the magnetic flux at the equatorial plane with surface current ( right panel ) does not change very much even if the values of @xmath169 increase .",
    "therefore , the negative surface current make the flux function at the equatorial surface smaller than that for the configuration without surface current . this reduction of the value of the magnetic flux function in the vacuum region can allow the wider support region to exist .             as for the geometry of magnetic fields , the surface currents bend the poloidal magnetic fields on the stellar surface as we have described in sec.[sec : j_sur_diff ] .",
    "fig.[fig : u_flux ] shows that the poloidal magnetic field lines bend due to the presence of the surface currents for configurations with @xmath166 ( left ) and @xmath167 ( right ) .",
    "thus far , nobody has obtained configurations with the surface currents in previous works ( see fig.2 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , configurations shown in fig.[fig : u_flux ] have discontinuities on their surfaces .",
    "the directions of the discontinuities depend on the directions of the surface currents . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the outward poloidal field lines are bended to the left side by the oppositely flowing surface currents . on the other hand ,",
    "if we add the surface currents whose flowing direction is the same as that of the interior bulk current , they are bended to the right side and the toroidal magnetic fields become weak because the surface currents flowing to the same direction as the interior bulk currents work so as to reduce the strengths of the interior bulk currents .",
    "the discontinuities of the magnetic fields in our models are the same as those of @xcite ( see fig.5 in their paper carefully ) .",
    "in fact , what they did in their paper , i.e. by imposing structures in which the magnetic fields on the stellar surfaces have some amount of discontinuities are effectively the same as adding the oppositely flowing surface currents to the magnetized stars .",
    "we consider configurations with other surface current distributions .",
    "we add the surface currents expressed by eq.([eq : j_sur_quad ] ) , which results in the quadrupole distribution of the poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "however , the toroidal magnetic field for this surface current can not become large enough . as the strength of the surface current",
    "is increased , we get configurations with no toroidal magnetic fields whose poloidal magnetic fields are not closed inside of the stars ( see the right panel in fig.[fig : dipole_quadrupole ] ) .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field vanishes in such a configuration .    in order to sustain strong toroidal magnetic fields ,",
    "we need strong toroidal currents in the stellar interior as discussed for the dipole - like distributions of the surface currents .",
    "however , as seen from the results for the quadrupole - like surface currents , surface currents contain both the negative component and the positive component in the surface currents .",
    "moreover , the strengths of those oppositely flowing currents are the same . therefore , the total surface current due to the purely quadrupole surface current of the purely spherical star vanishes as @xmath170 consequently , this kind of surface current can not counteract or cancel the effect of the interior bulk current density .",
    "it implies that we need @xmath171-th poles with @xmath172 odd numbers of the magnetic moments ( dipole , octopole etc . ) or locally strong surface currents which are not anti",
    "- symmetric about the equatorial plane in order to sustain the strong toroidal fields .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed that the presence of negative ( oppositely flowing ) surface currents in addition to positive interior bulk currents could allow more interior currents to exist within the stars . in particular , large interior toroidal currents",
    "could be realized by introducing negatively flowing surface currents in addition to positively flowing interior currents .",
    "consequently , such negatively flowing toroidal currents lead to larger positively flowing total currents , @xmath146 , within the stars , although the total currents , @xmath151 , have their upper bound as explained before .",
    "thus it is these larger positively flowing interior currents , @xmath146 , that cause the toroidal magnetic fields stronger .    among stationary magnetized stars",
    "thus far obtained in many papers , some authors have found configurations with large toroidal magnetic fields by treating the problem differently ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , no authors have explained reasons why there can appear such magnetic fields with large values of the toroidal magnetic field energies .      in this subsection , we will reconsider simple configurations with large toroidal magnetic fields from our standpoint of taking the negatively flowing currents into account . in order to clarify the reasons for existence of large toroidal magnetic fields",
    ", it would be helpful to employ as simple configurations as possible .",
    "as for the mechanical structures of the magnetized stars we consider @xmath173 polytropes , i.e , incompressible fluids .",
    "although the magnetic fields might become very strong , the shapes of the stellar configurations are assumed to be spheres .",
    "it is possible to consider that strongly magnetized stars have spherical surfaces by confining all the magnetic fields within the surfaces .",
    "this situation could be realized by treating the closed magnetic fields not only for the toroidal fields but also for the poloidal fields . under these assumptions , the formulations used by several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) can be applied . since",
    "our purpose of this part of the paper is not to obtain new stationary configurations but to understand the _ reasons _ for appearance of large toroidal magnetic fields , we will follow mostly the zero - flux - boundary scheme of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but we take account of the presence of negatively flowing surface currents as well as negatively flowing interior currents in addition to positively flowing interior currents .",
    "as for the arbitrary functions , we choose the functional form of @xmath59 as follows : @xmath174 and consequently @xmath175 this choice for @xmath48 as well as the form for @xmath176 have been commonly used in almost all zero - flux - boundary approaches which have treated configurations with closed dipole magnetic fields ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . from eq.([eq : current ] ) , the form of the current density becomes as below : @xmath177    since the gs equation is an elliptic type partial differential equation of the second order , we need to impose boundary conditions to obtain solutions consistently .",
    "we should note that , in all zero - flux - boundary approaches thus far carried out , the constant @xmath118 plays a role as an eigenvalue of the problem because boundary conditions have been imposed at finite places in the space in most investigations .",
    "one example of the boundary conditions might be as follows : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the radius of the spherical incompressible magnetized stars treated in this section .",
    "it should be noted that solutions with @xmath180 in our models , which can be found only after we have obtained stationary configurations and checked values of the derivative @xmath181 for all the models , are essentially the same as those of @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed once again that solutions which satisfy the condition @xmath180 would not always be found .",
    "it would be fortunate if one could find such solutions not by imposing that condition as one of boundary conditions but by just calculating solutions with the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary_closed0 ] ) and ( [ eq : boundary_closed ] ) .",
    "in this section , we continue to follow mostly the formulation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the surface currents were not taken into account explicitly , but in this paper we include the surface currents explicitly by modifying their formulation .    they treated incompressible fluid stars , i.e. @xmath173 polytropes by specifying arbitrary functions as we have already explained before .",
    "although incompressible stars seem far from realistic situations , from the standpoint of considering oppositely flowing currents including surface currents stressed in this paper , it is very useful to be able to get such solutions and discuss the role of the oppositely flowing currents analytically . nevertheless ,",
    "in this paper , we will also compute @xmath26 polytropes numerically and discuss the effect of the equation of state .",
    "for the functional forms we have chosen , the grad - shafranov equation , eq.([eq : gs ] ) , can be written as below : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the averaged value of the density .",
    "it should be noted that this is a linear equation for the magnetic flux function @xmath27 .",

    "it should be noted that , here in this paper , we consider only the dipole term @xmath197 which can be considered as the simplest configuration for the spherical incompressible magnetized fluid star .",
    "moreover it is important to note that even such simple configurations contain the essential natures of the configurations we are seeking to understand .",
    "as we have described before , we impose boundary conditions for @xmath27 .",
    "one condition is @xmath198 at the centre of the star .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled simply in our situation here by setting @xmath199 , because the spherical bessel function of the second kind @xmath200 does not vanish at the centre ( @xmath201 ) for the homogeneous solutions . as a result",

    "thus just by giving either @xmath118 or @xmath213 , one _ complete _ solution in our problem can be obtained .",
    "this is a nice feature of the simplest configurations , i.e. the @xmath173 polytropic configurations only with the @xmath214 component for the confined poloidal closed magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we will derive the surface current for our problem .",
    "the homogeneous term of this solution is related to the surface current as we have calculated in sec.[sec : j_sur_int ] .",

    "the toroidal magnetic field energy is slightly larger than that of the corresponding @xmath252 configuration .",
    "as we have calculated and seen in this paper , the negative ( oppositely flowing ) surface currents and/or the negative ( oppositely flowing ) interior currents seem to generate strong toroidal magnetic fields within the stars .",
    "we have obtained the configuration having the minimum value of @xmath254 when @xmath167 for the solutions of open fields by taking the surface currents into account . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath9 reaches 0.349 when all the magnetic field lines are closed and confined inside the stellar surface for @xmath26 polytropes .",
    "this value is much smaller than that for open field configurations with surface currents .",
    "the functional forms for the arbitrary functions and the boundary conditions of these two models , i.e. the closed filed solution and the open filed solution , are different from each other ( see eq.[eq : kappa ] and eq.[eq : jphi_closed ] ) , but both configurations contain the interior region where the interior currents are negative ( oppositely flowing ) and there appear very strong toroidal magnetic fields .    from the right panels in fig.[fig : j0_h_r_j_r ] , the signs of the @xmath60 term and the @xmath59 term are positive for our open field models with negative surface currents . in other words , the models do not contain the negative current regions . the open field models which we have obtained correspond to models of the type ( a ) for the closed field configurations . therefore , the stars could have stronger toroidal magnetic field energy if they can contain the negative interior current regions near the stellar surfaces .",
    "however , we could not find the functional form of @xmath59 for which the negative interior current region appears as the model of type ( d ) in this paper .",
    "in any case , the toroidal magnetic field energies of closed field models are larger than those of the corresponding open field models with negative surface currents .",
    "it should be noted that the model of type ( d ) sustains the largest toroidal magnetic field energy among all of our solutions obtained in this paper .",
    "we can conclude that the magnetized equilibria with strong toroidal magnetic field energies would be the closed field configurations .",
    "we have employed polytropes with @xmath26 and @xmath252 in this paper . since we are mainly interested in the effects of surface currents , we adopt polytropes as equations of state , although polytropes are too simple equations of state . the different equations of state result in different density distributions as well as different magnetic field structures , because the current density formula contains the density depending term ( eq.[eq : current ] ) . as we have described in sec.[sec : closed_fields_model ] , configurations for polytropes with @xmath26 can sustain slightly larger toroidal magnetic fields than those with @xmath252 , i.e. the minimum value of @xmath9 is @xmath255 for the @xmath252 polytropes and the minimum value of @xmath256 is @xmath257 for @xmath26 polytropes as far as the other parameters are the same .",
    "therefore , the configurations with softer equations of state can sustain stronger toroidal magnetic fields for polytropes .",
    "how about for more realistic equations of state discussed by other authors ?",
    "@xcite calculated twisted - torus magnetized equilibrium states using some realistic equations of state at zero temperature .",
    "their method is the same as our method .",
    "4 - fig . 7 in their paper",
    "show the density contours and the magnetic field contours for different equations of state .",
    "the structures of the poloidal magnetic field lines and the regions of the toroidal magnetic fields within the stellar surfaces are different among the different equations of state .",
    "for example , among models of the shen s equation of state ( eos ) , the position where the toroidal magnetic field attains its maximum strength is located near the stellar surface and the width of the region where the toroidal magnetic fields appear is relatively small , but for models with the fps s eos , the position of the maximum toroidal magnetic field is shifted to the inner part of the star and the size of the toroidal magnetic field region is much bigger than that for the shen s eos .",
    "although they did not calculated the toroidal magnetic field energies and the ratio @xmath9 , they showed the ratio of the local strength of the toroidal magnetic field to the poloidal magnetic field ( @xmath258 in table 4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath258 for fps s eos is about as twice as that for shen s eos .",
    "therefore , although the influence of the equation of state might become more important if we would consider structures of neutron stars , it would not change the basic properties discussed in this paper dramatically , although the values and/or the regions for the toroidal magnetic fields would surely be somewhat different from those obtained in this paper .",
    "it is very interesting and important to analyze stability of our models for open magnetic fields with surface currents .",
    "since some of our solutions satisfy the braithwaite s stability criteria , eq.([eq : criteria ] ) , our models could be stable .",
    "although it is very difficult to tell the stability for a certain model exactly , we will be able to check the stability by several non - exact ways and get rough idea about the stability of the configuration .",
    "first of all , we consider the stabilities of the magnetized stars with pure surface currents and with no interior currents ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole_quadrupole ] ) .",
    "the stability of the magnetized stars with surface currents in the surface region of an infinitely thin width could be considered to be essentially the same as that of configurations with pure surface currents . if the magnetized stars possess only the surface currents which generate the pure dipole magnetic fields outside the stars , their interior magnetic fields are uniform along the @xmath259 axis ( see the left panel of fig.[fig : dipole_quadrupole ] ) .",
    "the magnetic fields of this kind of configuration are unstable and decay within a few alfvn time , because there is no toroidal magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite also explained the instability of this kind of configuration and @xcite carried out non - linear evolution of the instability by numerical simulations and showed unstable growth of the initial stationary states as explained above .",
    "therefore , the fields of the magnetized stars with pure surface currents can be considered to be unstable .    by contrast , as for the configurations with surface currents , which might lay in , for example , the crusts of the neutron stars , the magnetic fields could become stable . in such configurations , we can assume that the widths of surface current layers are not infinitely thin any more and the finite lorentz force acts on the surface currents .",
    "@xcite considered configurations with surface current layers as well as with uniform magnetic fields and dipole magnetic fields inside and outside of the stellar surface , respectively , and found that those configurations with current layers might be stable . in realistic situations as neutron stars , when the solid crusts of neutron stars form after their proto - neutron phase",
    ", the crusts could sustain the lorenz force to themselves and they could prevent growth of the instability of magnetic fields . for such situations , the magnetic fields can survive in much longer time than the alfvn timescale .    concerning direct computations of the evolutions starting from the perturbed initial stationary states , @xcite carried out numerical evolutions of the twisted - torus interior magnetic fields with solid crusts .",
    "they included surface current layers with finite widths as their boundary condition for the magnetar s crust and used one of their quasi - stationary twisted configurations which they had obtained after long time simulations as initial values .",
    "their numerical model is similar to our solution with surface currents .",
    "the magnetic fields of such stars do not decay within the alfvn time scale in their simulations as far as the crusts can sustain the lorentz force .",
    "therefore , our twisted - torus models with surface currents would be also stable configurations .",
    "evolutions and stabilities of configurations for closed magnetic fields were argued by @xcite .",
    "they performed numerical simulations using @xcite solutions as their initial states .",
    "they concluded that models with closed fields both with poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields do not show any sign of becoming unstable within their simulation time if the initial model satisfy the stability criteria in eq .",
    "( [ eq : criteria ] ) .",
    "therefore , the closed magnetic field models which are obtained in this paper would be stable configurations .",
    "it is important to find out natural mechanisms to generate surface currents and/or their origins if we apply our models with surface currents to real bodies such as magnetized neutron stars , especially to magnetars .",
    "magnetars are young neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetars are considered as source objects of special high energetic phenomena such as the anomalous x - rays emission and the soft gamma - ray emission .",
    "thus those pulsars are called the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , in particular , their high x - ray luminosities and giant flares have been considered to be deeply related to the strong magnetic fields of the stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic fields are nearly dipole poloidal fields globally , but there would be higher order ( such as quadrupole and octopole ) poloidal magnetic fields near the surface or toroidal fields winded up by rapid differential rotation during the proto - neutron star stages ( @xcite ) inside the star . before we apply our models with surface currents to the magnetars with strong toroidal magnetic fields , we need to clarify or at least have some ideas about origins or formation mechanisms for the oppositely flowing surface currents or the discontinuity of the magnetic fields on the stellar surfaces .",
    "then , what is the origin of the negative surface currents or the negative current region ?",
    "there might be two possibilities to explain it .",
    "one is related to the crusts of neutron stars and the other is related to the magnetospheres around neutron stars .",
    "since the physics of the crusts of the neutron stars is too complicated and difficult to deal with , we only assume that the crusts consist of highly conductive solid matter .",
    "if the crusts are highly conductive , the electric currents can exist within the crust regions .",
    "then , the crusts can make parallel components of magnetic fields discontinuous near the stellar surfaces by the toroidal currents inside the crusts .",
    "the magnetic fields are frozen to the matter and fixed to the crusts because of their high conductivity .",
    "on the other hand , the interior matter of the magnetars is not solid",
    ". thus the matter inside of the crusts can move differently from the crusts and the discontinuities of the magnetic fields would be born between the crusts and the interior regions .",
    "the interior fields begin to spread toward the stellar surfaces by the some kind of magnetic diffusion ( @xcite ) the discontinuities would be enlarged by the magnetic pressure . as we have seen before ,",
    "@xcite simulated this kind of configuration and found the growing of the lorentz stress in the crusts . from the direction of the discontinuity",
    ", we expect that the stress is tensile one globally .",
    "if the crusts are cracked by the stress , it would result in flares of sgrs .",
    "following this scenario , our models with strong toroidal fields as well as surface currents are considered as stationary states of the crusts with strong lorentz forces before occurrence of giant flares .",
    "if a part of the crusts is cracking , the magnetic energy and the helicity are injected from the stars and would produce magnetized flows ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of magnetized outbursts would be giant flares of sgrs",
    ". we will consider this process by using our models with surface currents in the following .    at first , the surface currents in the crusts can sustain the strong toroidal fields by bending the poloidal magnetic fields as shown by the model with @xmath167 in the right panel of fig.[fig : u_flux ] .",
    "when the lorentz force exceeds a certain critical value , a part of the crust begins to crack .",
    "we can consider this phenomena as decreasing the strength of the surface current , because a part of the conductive matter is disturbed by the cracking .",
    "we assume that a certain cracking reduces the value of @xmath157 from @xmath260 to @xmath261 as an extreme example .",
    "the surface current with @xmath166 can not sustain the toroidal magnetic fields any more which the surface current with @xmath167 has sustained . the toroidal magnetic energy and/or the magnetic helicity would be transferred out into the outside of the star in order to relax to the stationary state with @xmath166 ( transition from the right panel to the left panel in fig.[fig : u_flux ] ) . through this cracking ,",
    "the dimensionless toroidal magnetic field energy @xmath262 changes from @xmath263 to @xmath264 according to our calculations .",
    "therefore , about 60 % of the toroidal magnetic field energy would be released during the cracking .",
    "although this is an extreme example , it is natural that the injection of the magnetic helicity and the release of the toroidal field come from the transition of the magnetized equilibria by the phenomena such as cracks of the crusts which reduce the surface current strength .",
    "another possibility is the effect due to the magnetosphere which excites oppositely flowing current densities near the stellar surfaces .",
    "@xcite discussed the importance of the magnetosphere as the boundary conditions for both the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields on the stellar surfaces .",
    "our present models and many configurations in other previous works assume that the outside of the star is vacuum where the current density and the toroidal magnetic fields do not exit .",
    "however , the presence of the magnetosphere changes the boundary condition for the magnetic field .",
    "this change of the boundary condition would significantly influence on the magnetic field configurations as we have seen .    as for rotation powered pulsars ,",
    "there have been many investigations about their magnetospheric phenomena such as pulsar winds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their rapid rotations produce enormously large electrical forces and the surface charged layers could not stay in their stationary states .",
    "charged particles run away from the stellar surfaces and form the pulsar magnetospheres ( see , for the recent particle pulsar wind simulations , @xcite ) .",
    "this charged particles would produce the strong currents outside the star and the twisted magnetosphere would form .    the rotational speeds and the strengths of the magnetic fields of the magnetars are different from those of pulsars , but there would be some kinds of magnetospheres around the magnetars .",
    "the recent x - ray spectral observations show the presence of a magnetosphere for the magnetar ( @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite computed numerically a force - free twisted magnetar magnetosphere .",
    "they treated the stationary state of the magnetized star as an inner boundary condition for the magnetosphere .",
    "we can see the various magnetospheric structures by applying different inner boundary conditions in their paper . if the magnetosphere forms the oppositely flowing toroidal currents near the stellar surface , the magnetized star can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic field energy inside the star",
    ". however , the details of the calculation are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "in this paper we have dealt with the effects of surface currents upon the interior toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "we have shown that the oppositely flowing surface currents can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic field energy inside the star both for the open and closed field configurations .    in the open field models",
    ", we have found that there is an upper bound of the total current of the star for a fixed set of parameter values . increasing the maximum strength of the toroidal magnetic field decreases the region of the toroidal magnetic field due to this upper bound .",
    "therefore this upper bound limits the ratio of the poloidal magnetic field energy to the total magnetic field energy . to exceed this upper bound ,",
    "magnetized star needs the oppositely flowing surface currents to the interior toroidal currents .",
    "the interior current can overcome the upper bound and the ratio @xmath265 decreases significantly , because the surface current counteracts the interior toroidal current .    in the closed field models , we have found that a model with an oppositely flowing current region but with no surface current can sustain the strongest toroidal magnetic field among all of our magnetized stationary states .",
    "the negative surface currents can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic fields in the models with closed magnetic fields . however , the strengths of the toroidal magnetic fields for models with negative surface currents can not exceed a critical value even if the strength of the surface current becomes infinity . in order to overcome the critical value ,",
    "the negative current region is required . increasing the size of the negative",
    "interior current region decreases the negative surface current . as a result",
    ", the toroidal magnetic fields become the strongest when not only the negative interior current region becomes the largest but also the surface current disappears .    it should be also noted that",
    ", although we have not imposed a condition @xmath266 , the obtained two eigenfunctions without surface currents fulfill this condition and , moreover , that the values of @xmath267 are very small .",
    "this implies that by computing a series of eigen states with surface currents as well as with oppositely flowing interior currents we could have easily reached an eigen state whose eigen function behaves very _ smoothly _ for which the role of the toroidal magnetic fields becomes very important .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that these solutions obtained by considering _ in the wider functional space _ without no restrictions about the slopes of the functions correspond to those solutions obtained by other authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have applied the models of open magnetic fields with surface currents to explain the strong hidden toroidal magnetic fields inside the magnetars .",
    "we have considered two possibilities as the origin of their surface currents .",
    "one possibility is related to the crusts of the magnetars .",
    "since the crusts are made of the solid matter , it could make the magnetic fields discontinuous at the crusts and the surface currents would appear due to these discontinuities .",
    "the magnetized stars can sustain the strong toroidal magnetic field energy by bending the poloidal magnetic fields within the crust zones .",
    "the other possibility for the excitement of oppositely flowing currents inside and/or on the stellar surface might be related to magnetospheres which produce the oppositely flowing toroidal currents near and/or on the stellar surface .",
    "this kind of magnetosphere would also sustain the strong toroidal magnetic field energy inside the star .",
    "these models might be the key to reveal the mechanism of the giant flares of the magnetars .",
