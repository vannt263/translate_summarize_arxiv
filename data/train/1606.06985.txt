    "study of the thermodynamic properties of microscopic quantum systems has been an active field of research in recent times @xcite .",
    "considerable efforts have been directed to develop and characterize quantum heat engines , and to determine whether `` quantum '' advantages can be obtained in these machines over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "quantum analogues of the well - known classical carnot and otto engines have been extensively studied @xcite , and implemented in laboratories using mesoscopic substrates @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and ionic systems @xcite .    on one hand , this has motivated researchers to test the laws of thermodynamics at the quantum mechanical level @xcite , and to determine the efficiencies of quantum heat engines , analogous to those provided by the enormously studied classical heat engines @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a great deal of interest has been attracted towards building `` small '' quantum refrigerators , which consist of only a few quantum levels , and the energy required to drive the refrigerator is obtained from local heat baths attached to the subsystems constituting the refrigerator , known as the absorption refrigerator @xcite . despite their simple working principles , small quantum refrigerators are shown to be useful in quantum error correction , where cold ancillary qubits are considered as resources @xcite .",
    "implementation schemes for such models in laboratories @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "the motivation for studying such microscopic refrigerators from an information - theoretic perspective @xcite lies , for example , in the facts that thermodynamics has a close connection with both classical and quantum information theory @xcite . a special phenomenon , namely , the `` steady - state cooling '' , in the case of a quantum self - sufficient refrigerator constituted of only three qubits @xcite has recently been in focus . here ,",
    "the steady state temperature of one of the qubits , called the `` cold '' qubit , is less than its initial temperature , and it , in general , can occur at large time in the dynamics .",
    "however , refrigeration at short time in these models , which can be more accessible in the experiments , remains a relatively less explored topic .",
    "only recently a few studies have addressed this issue @xcite , and pointed out the benefit of transient cooling over the steady state cooling , by using uncorrelated product thermal states as well as states with coherence in the energy eigenbasis , as the initial states .",
    "it has been shown that the transient regime of such refrigerators may provide a better cooling , in the sense of attaining a lower temperature , as compared to that in its steady state , which highlights the importance of the study of the systems as it approaches towards its equilibrium . in situations where the time scale to attain the equilibrium is too high to implement , or where very fast cooling is required",
    ", transient cooling may emerge as the _ practical _ option to attain refrigeration . in this paper , we ask the following question : can there exist a situation where the transient cooling is the only option for refrigeration to occur ?",
    "in this scenario , no steady - state cooling takes place .",
    "the next immediate question is to find out whether such a phenomenon is generic to small quantum refrigerators irrespective of the different models of thermalization .",
    "this paper answers both the questions affirmatively . towards this aim ,",
    "we consider two paradigmatic models of thermalization for a three - qubit self - contained quantum refrigerator attached to local heat baths .",
    "one of them is the well - studied reset model @xcite , and the other one is a more realistic scenario where the local baths are collection of harmonic oscillators that interact with the qubits via memoryless interactions @xcite .",
    "we identify a _",
    "canonical _ form of the qubit - bath interaction parameters which eases the presentation of situations where no steady - state cooling takes place , and transient cooling is the only option to attain refrigeration .",
    "we demonstrate this phenomenon for both the models , and find out regions in the space of the qubit - bath parameters where such a phenomenon takes place . also , we point out that with a slight modification of our canonical form of the qubit - bath interactions , a condition emerges where the system cools fast and attains its minimum temperature either at the steady state , or in the transient regime . for each set of parameters ,",
    "we quantify the speed of cooling by introducing a `` half - time '' , which the system takes to attain half the maximum cooling possible for the fixed set of parameters .",
    "our result indicates that such a situation is generic to the different models of thermalization for the three - qubit quantum absorption refrigerator .",
    "moreover , we show that in the parameter space where transient cooling is the only option for refrigeration , negligible or no bipartite quantum correlations in all the possible bipartitions of the three - qubit system is generated during the initial phase of the dynamics .",
    "interestingly , for the model of thermalization involving collections of harmonic oscillators as local bath , a `` freezing '' , i.e. , almost invariance , of the minimum temperature attained of the cold qubit with respect to change in system parameters is observed .",
