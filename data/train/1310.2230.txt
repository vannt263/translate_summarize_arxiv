    "gluon saturation at small-@xmath1 in a large nucleus has attracted great attention in the last few decades , and progresses have been made theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of this phenomenon changes the landscape of parton distributions inside the nucleon / nucleus . in the dense region ,",
    "the characteristics of qcd dynamics is different from that in the dilute region , for example , the evolution equation has to be modified to account for coherent interactions among high density gluons . to better explore the strong interaction dynamics in the dense region , it is important to have physical processes with two distinct scales , one hard scale @xmath3 to localize the probe and a relatively soft scale to be sensitive to the saturation physics  @xcite",
    ". it was realized that two - scale observables make it possible to perform the small-@xmath1 calculations in terms of the factorization approach  @xcite , and to provide directly access to the unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugds ) , which are important ingredients in the saturation physics , and unveil the importance of the coherent multiple interaction effects in the small-@xmath1 calculations  @xcite .",
    "several processes have been proposed in the literature , including semi - inclusive dis  @xcite , low @xmath4 drell - yan  @xcite , and back - to - back di - hadron correlations in forward @xmath0 processes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate that the heavy quarkonium production in the forward region of @xmath0 collisions is an excellent probe of the saturation physics at small-@xmath1 .",
    "earlier works to calculate the heavy quarkonium production using the saturation formalism have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the inclusive productions are the main focus and the calculations are done in the simple color - singlet model . in our calculations",
    "below , we concentrate on rapidity and transverse momentum distribution , and follow an effective factorization approach  @xcite with two models dealing with the hadronization from heavy quark pairs to physical quarkonia . one model is based on non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite , an effective theory of qcd , and the other is the so - called color evaporation model ( cem )  @xcite .",
    "both nrqcd model and cem share a similar idea for heavy quarkonium production :   heavy quark pairs are produced at short distance , and all pairs , at various spin states with / without color , could hadronize into physical heavy quarkonia . in nrqcd ,",
    "the hadronization probability from different states of heavy quark pairs is organized by the power of @xmath5 and the power of heavy quark velocity @xmath6 in the pair s rest frame . in cem , on the other hand , every produced heavy quark pairs have the same probability to transform into the same quarkonium state , so long as the pairs invariant masses are within the open charm threshold . both approaches give a reasonable description of unpolarized @xmath7 and @xmath8 production at a large transverse momentum at collider energies @xcite .",
    "we focus our calculations of heavy quarkonium production in @xmath0 collisions in the forward region ( large rapidity region along the direction of proton ) , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa2qqb ] , where we believe that a factorization approach might be justified .",
    "in addition , we concentrate on the production of heavy quarkonium with relatively low transverse momentum @xmath4 , which is mainly generated by coherent multiple scattering of soft gluons from the nuclei . more specifically , we present our calculations for the region , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is quarkonium mass and @xmath11 is the saturation scale of the nuclei with atomic weight @xmath12 . in general",
    ", the factorization between the production of heavy quark pair and the pair s hadronization to a physical quarkonium , assumed to be true in both nrqcd and cem , is not necessarily valid in this kinematic regime .",
    "when @xmath13 with heavy quark mass @xmath14 , multiple scattering of heavy quark pair with gluons from nuclei could interfere with the pair s hadronization process , and invalidate the velocity expansion of the nrqcd approach .",
    "however , in the very forward region , the system of heavy quark pair moves through nuclear matter with a very large longitudinal momentum @xmath15 , the dynamics of coherent interaction between the pair , which leads to the formation of a bound quarkonium , is strongly time dilated . with a time dilation factor @xmath16 , we conclude that if @xmath17 the pair s hadronization is effectively frozen ( or not even started ) when the pair passes through and interacts with the nuclei , so that the pair s hadronization is effectively factorized from the production of the pair .",
    "the condition , @xmath18 , effectively ensures that the interaction between the heavy quark pair and the spectators of incoming proton is suppressed by powers of @xmath19 with proton saturation scale @xmath20 in this region , and we could use collinear factorization to factorize the active gluon from the colliding proton . the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac - condition ] ) allows us to calculate the multiple interactions of the pair with the nuclear target .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that for hard processes in @xmath0 collisions , these multiple interactions could be reduced to the un - integrated gluon distributions which can be easily formulated in small-@xmath1 saturation formalism .",
    "we show that such an effective @xmath21 factorization from the nucleus is also valid for heavy quarkonium production in @xmath0 collisions , where a very important feature emergences that the un - integrated gluon distribution is the same in both nrqcd and cem approaches in the large @xmath2 limit",
    ". therefore , these two approaches will give the same predictions for the nuclear suppression factor in our calculations .",

    "such large logarithmic contributions have to be resummed .",
    "we use the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism for the resummation  @xcite . for heavy quarkonium production in hadronic collisions , resummation of sudakov large logarithms",
    "was first addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite by using css formalism and cem for the formation of quarkonia .",
    "recently , the same resummation were carried out in the nrqcd formalism as well  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated recently that the soft gluon resummation and small-@xmath1 evolution can be performed consistently for the hard processes in @xmath0 collisions  @xcite .",
    "we apply the same technique to heavy quarkonium production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the combination of the qcd resummation and the effective @xmath21-factorization from the nucleus in @xmath0 collisions at small-@xmath1 makes the heavy quarkonium production as a powerfull tool to investigate the saturation physics .",
    "most importantly , we show that the hadronization mechanism does not affect the sensitivity of the nuclear suppression of heavy quarkonium production in the forward @xmath0 collisions .",

    "we extend the sudakov resummation to heavy quarkonium production in sec .",
    "iii , and discuss heavy quarkonium suppression in @xmath0 collisions in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize our paper and comment on the phenomenological applications in sec .  v.",
    "in this section , we calculate the heavy quarkonium production at low transverse momentum in @xmath0 collisions in the small-@xmath1 factorization formalism , and demonstrate that an effective @xmath21-factorization applies for both nrqcd and cem models .",
    "we take @xmath24 limit , and neglect all higher order corrections . since the details in production mechanism is different in nrqcd and cem , we present the calculations separately .",
    "let us recall the two basic unintegrated gluon distributions in the small-@xmath1 formalism .",
    "the first gluon distribution , the so - called weizscker - williams ( ww ) gluon distribution can be defined following the conventional gluon distribution   @xmath25where @xmath26 is the gauge field strength tensor @xmath27 with @xmath28 the antisymmetric structure constants for @xmath29 with @xmath30 the color indices , and @xmath31 is the gauge link in the adjoint representation @xmath32 with @xmath33 . in the small-@xmath1 factorization calculations , this distribution can be written in terms of the correlator of four wilson lines as  @xcite , @xmath34u^\\dagger(v')\\left[\\partial_iu(v')\\right]u^\\dagger(v)\\right\\rangle_{x_g},\\ ] ] where the wilson line @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 $ ] , and the notation @xmath37 is used for the color glass condensate ( cgc ) average of the color charges over the nuclear wave function where @xmath38 is the smallest fraction of longitudinal momentum probed , and is determined by the kinematics . for a large nucleus , this distribution at a small-@xmath1 can be evaluated using the mclerran - venugopalan model  @xcite @xmath39where @xmath40 is the number of colors , @xmath41 is the transverse area of the target nucleus , and @xmath42 is the gluon saturation scale with @xmath43 the color charge density in a large nuclei .    the second gluon distribution , the fourier transform of the dipole cross section , is defined in the fundamental representation , @xmath44\\dagger } f^{+i}(0)\\mathcal{u}^{[+]}\\right]|p\\rangle \\ ,   \\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the gauge link @xmath45}=u^n\\left[0,-\\infty;0\\right]u^n\\left[-\\infty , \\xi^{- } ; \\xi_{\\perp}\\right]$ ] stands for initial state interactions .",
    "thus , the dipole gluon distribution contains both initial and final state interactions in the definition , and can be calculated in the mv model , @xmath46      in the nrqcd formalism , we can write down the production of heavy quarkonium into the following form , @xmath47+x)\\langle\\o^h[n]\\rangle \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48+x)$ ] is the cross section at the parton level , which represents the production of a pair of heavy quark in a fixed color , spin and orbital angular momentum state @xmath49 and can be calculated perturbatively .",

    "ldmes are organized in terms of the velocity @xmath6 expansion in the nrqcd framework .",

    "the typical diagrams are plotted in fig .  2 , where the final state @xmath55 can be either color - singlet or color - octet .",

    "the latter equation results into vanishing contribution , because @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , nonzero leading order expansion is proportional to @xmath66 , and its contribution leads to @xmath67 .",

    "we argue that in this model , the heavy quarkonium production is dominated by the pair production close to the bound state mass range . in the partonic scattering process , this argument tells us that the momentum fraction of the heavy quark and antiquark is restricted to @xmath86 region .",
