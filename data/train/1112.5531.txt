    "<S> the thermodynamic property for @xmath7 is very well described in terms of the elementary excitations characteristic of the quantum sg model , while for the other field directions , significant contributions from other excitation modes beyond the framework of the quantum sg model were observed . for @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> a quantum phase transition between gapless and gapped ground states was observed . </S>"
