    "supernova explosions have a profound effect on the morphology , kinematics , and ionization balance of galaxies , and possibly trigger new generations of star formation .",
    "however , based on statistical studies of the incompleteness of galactic snr catalogs and predictions of the galactic snr rate , there should be many more snrs in our galaxy ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than are currently known ( @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paucity is likely due in part to selection effects acting against the discovery of the more mature , faint , extended remnants , as well as , the very young , small remnants due to poor sensitivity and spatial resolution at low frequencies where snrs are brightest ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "these missing remnants are thought to be concentrated toward the inner galaxy where the diffuse nonthermal galactic plane emission coupled with the thermal emission from hii regions causes the most confusion .",
    "a complete census of galactic snrs is essential to understand the star formation history of our galaxy .",
    "recent advances in both the instrumentation and software for low radio frequency observations make sensitive , high resolution imaging in this relatively unexplored waveband possible for the first time . as a test case for a larger fully sampled mosaic of the inner galactic plane from @xmath9 to @xmath10 we imaged the region around the known snr g11.2@xmath20.3 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) at 74 and 330 mhz using data from multiple configurations .",
    "we have also obtained a vla mosaic at 1465 mhz of this region along with 235 mhz data from the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "the final region of overlap of these different data sets covers a @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field of view , in which we detect two known snrs : g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath2 - 0.1 and identify three new snrs .",
    "the results from these observations are presented below .",
    "we have carried out observations of the galactic plane centered on the known snr g11.2@xmath20.3 at four frequencies : 1465 , 330 , 235 , and 74 mhz .",
    "the 1465 , 330 , and 74 mhz data were obtained with the vla in multiple configurations , while the 235 mhz data were obtained from the gmrt .",
    "the fwhp primary beams of the single pointing 330 , 235 , and 74 mhz data are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "data at all four frequencies were acquired in spectral line mode in order to aid in radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision and minimize bandwidth smearing .",
    "the parameters for these observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the data from all four frequencies were reduced and imaged using the wide - field imaging capabilities within the nrao aips ( astronomical image processing software ) package .",
    "more information on wide - field imaging techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "some additional details of wide - field galactic plane imaging can be found in @xcite .",
    "the initial antenna based gain and phase corrections for the 235 , 330 , and 1465 mhz data were calculated in the usual way from observations of the phase calibrator 1833@xmath2210 and either 3c286 or 3c48 for flux calibration .",
    "unfortunately , there are no point like calibrators at 74 mhz that are strong enough to dominate the total flux in the large 74 mhz primary beam ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "for this reason , the flux scale and a single instrumental phase at 74 mhz were estimated from observations of cygnus  a using a publicly available model of its source structure . since cygnus  a is far from the target field , initial estimates for the phase as a function of time , as well as positional information for the target field were obtained by using the vla 330 mhz image as the model in the first round of 74 mhz phase only self - calibration ( see * ? ? ? * for further details specific to 74 mhz vla data reduction ) . at all four frequencies , following the initial calibrat - based corrections , several iterations of self - calibration were applied to data from each configuration or observation listed in table 1 in order to improve the dynamic range .",
    "the calibrated visibility data from all of the available observations for each frequency were then concatenated into a single @xmath14-@xmath15 data set , after which one further amplitude and phase calibration was performed .",
    "the 1465 mhz vla image is composed of a three pointing mosaic , with the pointings arranged in a triangle with g11.2@xmath20.3 near its center .",
    "the fwhp primary beam of each pointing is @xmath16 .",
    "the three pointings were calibrated and imaged separately and then combined with the linear mosaicing task flatn within aips . during the flatn process , the individual pointings were corrected for the response of the primary beam and then masked at the 25% power point .",
    "the final 1465 mhz image covers a @xmath0  deg@xmath1 area .",
    "after correction for the primary beam response , the 330 , 235 , and 74 mhz images were subimaged to the same field of view .    to correct for the gain compression that the gmrt suffers when observing toward bright sources ( i.e. the inner galactic plane ) ,",
    "an additional gain correction factor must be applied to the 235 mhz data after imaging .",
    "this factor can be estimated at the time of the observations by comparing the total power data for the calibrators with and without the automatic level attenuators on for each antenna . at the time of the second gmrt 235 mhz observation ( see table 1 ) , this empirical factor had an average value of 4 ( this factor is not available for the first gmrt observation ) .",
    "however , the integrated flux density measurements of the known snrs ( g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 ) after multiplying the final image by this correction factor were excessively high given their known spectral indices .",
    "this discrepancy may be due in part to the amplitude self - calibrations that were applied to the 235 mhz data before the gain correction factor , or it is possible that the correction factor for the first observing run may be different from that of the second . in order to better calibrate the 235 mhz gain ,",
    "we have used the spectral index between 330 and 1465 mhz at each pixel for g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 to create an image of the expected flux density at 235 mhz for each pixel .",
    "this approach is justified since the continuum spectra of snrs above 150 mhz are well characterized by a constant power - law spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of the expected 235 mhz image with the observed ( uncorrected ) image yielded an average correction factor of 2.7 .",
    "the final 235 mhz image was multiplied by 2.7 , before primary beam correction .",
    "the corrected 235 mhz image was then convolved to a resolution of @xmath3 .    for the 1465 and 330 mhz vla data",
    ", care was taken to match the @xmath14-@xmath15 coverage so that each composite data set had an intrinsic resolution of approximately @xmath3 .",
    "the images were then convolved to exactly @xmath3 , but the convolution was minimal .",
    "the 1465 and 330 mhz data are not sensitive to structures larger than @xmath17 .",
    "the vla 74 mhz data have a resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "the 74 mhz image does not include a - configuration data because exceptionally poor ionospheric conditions rendered them uncalibratable . since the 74 mhz resolution only marginally resolves the snrs , and as described above , the amplitude calibration of the 235 mhz data is a bit uncertain , data from these two frequencies were only used for integrated flux measurements .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show our vla 1465 mhz and 330 mhz images with @xmath3 resolution of a @xmath0  deg@xmath1 area centered at g11.2@xmath20.3 .",
    "the rms noise levels in these two images are @xmath0 mjy  beam@xmath19 at 1465 mhz and @xmath20 mjy  beam@xmath19 at 330 mhz , while the dynamic range in these two images are 470 and 340 , respectively .",
    "the known snrs g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 are labeled on figure 1a for reference along with the locations of the three new snr candidates designated a , b , and c. the galactic coordinates for the new snr candidates are a : g11.15@xmath20.71 , b : g11.03@xmath20.05 , and c : g11.18 + 0.11 .",
    "these positions have been taken from the approximate center of the snr shells , and for the purpose of this paper two significant digits ( instead of the usual one ) are used to help distinguish the new candidate snrs from the two known remnants .",
    "given the strong morphological and spectral evidence presented below , we will henceforth refer to these sources as `` new snrs '' , rather than snr candidates .",
    "integrated flux density measurements were made for the four frequencies in our study for all five snrs .",
    "since the images have different noise levels , and several of the sources have regions of `` breakout '' morphology that tend to gradually fade into the noise ( i.e. not sharp shells ) it was difficult to determine where the boundaries of the snrs should be drawn .",
    "therefore , in order to get comparable flux density estimates , the @xmath21 ( 12 mjy  beam@xmath19 ) contour of the 330 mhz image ( see figure 1b ) was used to define the snrs for all of the integrated flux measurements .",
    "the errors on these flux density measurements were estimated by @xmath22 at each frequency .",
    "upper limits for nondetections were estimated by @xmath23 .",
    "the rms noise of the 235 mhz and 74 mhz data are 8 mjy  beam@xmath19 and 150 mjy  beam@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "when necessary , an extra contribution from the background was subtracted from the integrated flux density .",
    "this contribution was estimated by integrating the flux in a nearby source free region with the same approximate area as the source .",
    "the background level correction was only necessary for the 74 and 235 mhz images .",
    "in addition , the error estimates for the 235 mhz flux densities have had an additional @xmath24 error added to account for the extra uncertainty in the 235 mhz gain calibration described above .",
    "flux densities from the literature have also been included in our analysis for all cases in which an error estimate is available and the error is less than 20% .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the integrated radio continuum spectra for the two known snrs in our field , g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 .",

    "further details for each snr are described below in  3.1 .    for each snr ,",
    "the integrated spectral index was calculated using a weighted least squares fit using the data points shown in figures 2 - 6 ( except for the 74 mhz upper limits ) . due to the method described above to calibrate the 235 mhz gain , the data points at 235 mhz were not used to fit the spectral index for g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 ( i.e. since these 235 mhz flux densities were used to set the 235 mhz gain scale ) .",

    "figures 7a - e show spatially resolved spectral index maps toward the five snrs between 330 and 1465 mhz . before calculating the spectral index ,",
    "the two images were masked at the @xmath21 level ( 12 and 4 mjy  beam@xmath19 , respectively ) .",
    "due to the low level calibration and positional errors that are inherent in these low frequency images , small scale spectral index variations less than @xmath31 should be viewed skeptically .",

    "it is interesting that the high end of the distance ranges presented in table 2 ( assuming a @xmath71 fractional error ) , would unrealistically place all three of the new snrs outside the bounds of the galaxy , perhaps suggesting that the distance to these snrs are not well fit by eq .",
    "note that the cases of g11.15@xmath20.71 and g11.18 + 0.11 are particularly uncertain ( independent of the accuracy of eq .",
    "2 ) since the angular size ( @xmath72 ) of these two snrs are difficult to estimate since they only appear as partial shells in the current images .",
    "this analysis suggests that the three new snrs may lie on the far side of the galaxy , but hi absorption measurements are needed to better constrain their distances .",
    "in addition to the pulsar associated with g11.2@xmath20.3 described in  3.1.1 , one other pulsar has been discovered within the confines our low frequency field of view .",
    "psr j1809@xmath21917 was discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey by @xcite and is located at ra@xmath56 , dec @xmath73 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the position of the pulsar is indicated on figure 9 .",
    "it has a pulse period of 83 ms , a flux density at 1400 mhz of 2.5 mjy , dispersion measure dm= 197 pc @xmath74 , a dispersion measure distance of @xmath75 kpc , and a characteristic age of 50 kyr .",
    "we do not detect the pulsar at either 330 or 1465 mhz .",
    "this is not surprising for the 1465 mhz data because the noise rises to @xmath76 mjy  beam@xmath19 near the edge of the image ( due to the primary beam correction ) .",
    "however , if we assume a typical pulsar spectral index of @xmath77 the predicted 330 mhz flux density is 45 mjy  beam@xmath19 which should be easily detectable in our 330 mhz image ( rms noise 3 mjy  beam@xmath19 ) .",
    "alternatively , the pulsar s spectral index could be lower than average ( @xmath78 predicts @xmath79 mjy  beam@xmath19 ) . in the current atnf pulsar catalog ,",
    "@xmath80 of of the 283 pulsars with a measured spectral index have @xmath81 .",
    "the characteristic age estimate ( 50 kyr ) assumes that the birth spin period is negligible compared to the current spin period .",
    "however , recent studies on a small number of pulsars , for which an independent age estimate can be made , suggest that the birth period is actually between 20 to 130 ms ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus for young pulsars that currently have short spin periods ( i.e. little spin down has yet occurred ) , a fundamental assumption of the characteristic age calculation is violated .",
    "this implies that the true ages of these pulsars could be significantly younger than suggested by the characteristic age .",
    "for example , if the birth period of psr j1809@xmath21917 was @xmath82 ms , and we assume that the spin down is dominated by dipole radiation with a braking index of 3 , then the true age of the pulsar is @xmath83 kyr , half the characteristic age ( see * ? ? ?",
    "psr j1809@xmath21917 is located about @xmath84 from the center of g11.03@xmath20.05 ( new snr b ) and @xmath85 from the center of g11.18 + 0.11 ( new snr c ) .",
    "if these snrs are located @xmath86 kpc away ( see table 2 ) compared to the @xmath75 kpc distance estimated for the pulsar , then obviously there can be no association .",
    "however , as described in  4.2 the uncertainty in distances derived from the @xmath68 relation are considerable .",
    "also , given that the pulsar is fairly young and the notorious difficulty with establishing snr / pulsar associations , it is worthwhile to determine whether the pulsar could have reasonably moved to its current location from the center of either remnant ( assuming they are at the same distance ) .",
    "no independent distance has yet been obtained for psr j1809@xmath21917 , so we will assume the dispersion measure pulsar distance of 4 kpc .",
    "this distance is based on a model for the electron distribution along the line of sight to the pulsar and is probably good to within @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the pulsar is 50 kyr old , the pulsar s transverse speed would need to be @xmath88 km  s@xmath19 to originate from g11.03@xmath20.05 and @xmath89 km  s@xmath19 for g11.18 + 0.11 .",
    "such transverse velocities are quite reasonable for pulsars , and would still be plausible if the true age of the pulsar is younger than the characteristic age as described above , or the pulsar is more distant . for example",
    ", from analysis of the velocity distributions of a large sample of pulsars , @xcite predict that @xmath90 of pulsars have velocities @xmath91 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "further assessment of the reality of a possible association with either remnant will have to await more reliable distance estimates for the snrs .      the integrated continuum spectra shown in figures 2 and 3 for g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 show clear signs of a low frequency turnover .",
    "their optical depths at 74 mhz of 0.56 and 1.1 , respectively , are higher than those found by @xcite by about @xmath71 . because our new spectra include critical new data points at 74 and 330 mhz and we have chosen to only use integrated flux densities from the literature with error estimates that are less than @xmath92 , our estimated optical depths are more accurate . the three new snrs also show indications of a low frequency turnover based on their 74 mhz upper limits , which we hope to confirm with future higher resolution 74 mhz data . from a survey of the integrated continuum spectra of 47 galactic snrs",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath93 of the observed remnants show a low frequency turnover below @xmath94 mhz .",
    "this turnover is thought to be due to free - free absorption by intermediate temperature ( @xmath95 k ) and density ( @xmath96 @xmath74 ) ionized thermal gas along the line of sight to the snrs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "based on the fact that such absorption is not seen toward all snrs , and does not seem to depend on distance , it is unlikely that the absorbing medium is a distributed component of the ism , but is more likely associated with discrete sources .",
    "kassim estimates that the filling factor of ionized material with the required electron densities and temperatures is @xmath97 .",
    "a number of origins for the absorbing medium have been suggested .",
    "two obvious sources of galactic ionized gas : the warm ionized medium ( wim ) and hii regions do not provide the appropriate physical conditions .",
    "the wim has electron densities that are too low by a factor of @xmath98 to 100 and its filling factor is too high ( @xmath99 ; * ? ? ?",
    "normal hii regions have electron densities and temperatures that are far too high to account for the moderate low frequency optical depths that are observed , and they would be easily detected in higher frequency continuum observations .",
    "one reasonable suggestion is that the extended envelopes of normal hii regions ( ehes ) might well provide the requisite temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether such envelopes extend far enough into the ism to account for a large fraction of the snrs showing low frequency absorption .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that galactic `` worms '' may cause absorption toward some sources .",
    "worms are thought to be created after the first generations of an ob star cluster explode as supernovae , blowing a large evacuated superbubble , the walls of which are then ionized by later generations of ob stars .",
    "the spatial extent of such worms can be several degrees across .",
    "@xcite have cataloged 118 galactic worm candidates from single dish hi and radio continuum data plus correlations with iras infrared data .",
    "all of the worm candidates lie toward the inner galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that in some cases worms also emit rrls and that the electron densities and temperatures expected for worms are commiserate with those needed to produce free - free absorption at low radio frequencies .",
    "the low frequency absorption observed toward the snr w49  b ( g43.3@xmath20.2 ) by @xcite could be a case of absorption by a worm .",
    "an early identification of the existence of ionized thermal gas toward w49  b came from the detection of rrl lines at @xmath100 km  s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xcite subsequently found excellent agreement between the spatially resolved morphology of the free - free absorption at 74 mhz and that of hi absorption at @xmath100 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "there are no obvious hii regions near w49b ( in the plane of the sky ) with a velocity of @xmath100 km  s@xmath19 that could be a candidate for producing an ehe .",
    "lacey et al . suggest that the absorption is due to a few compact hii regions ( and their envelopes ) along the line of sight to w49  b itself , but it is difficult to see how the cores of such hii regions could escape detection at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , one of the worms cataloged by @xcite is in this general direction ( gw 44.8@xmath21.8 ) has an extent of @xmath101 and velocities between 43 to 66 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "future rrl observations may determine whether the physical conditions in the worm are in agreement with those needed to produce the free - free absorption .",
    "it also possible that some snrs could create their own absorbing medium if they happen to run into a nearby molecular cloud , assuming that the shock is a fast , ionizing j - type shock .",
    "evidence for this case has recently been discovered for the snr 3c  391 which is known to be interacting with a nearby molecular cloud ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spatially resolved morphology of the 74 mhz free - free absorption toward 3c  391 matches very well with that of mid - infrared fine structure atomic lines that are known to be good tracers of ionic shocks ( brogan et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    "since all of these phenomena exist , it is likely that each of them are responsible for at least some fraction of the observed free - free absorption and only by studying a number of sources in detail can the dominant process be determined .",
    "the emission measures implied by our newly derived optical depths for g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 can be calculated from : @xmath102 where em is the emission measure , @xmath103 is the electron temperature , and @xmath104 is the gaunt factor and is @xmath0 at the temperatures and densities discussed here @xcite . assuming an electron temperature of 5000 k , the average emission measure ( em ) for absorbing gas toward g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 at 74 mhz are @xmath105 @xmath106 pc and @xmath107 @xmath106 pc , respectively .",
    "accounting for the lower @xmath103 used here , 5,000 k instead of 10,000 k , these emission measures are similar to those found toward the snr w49  b @xcite .",
    "there are no indications in the spectral index maps of g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 between 330 and 1465 mhz of the morphology of the absorbing medium .",
    "this is not surprising given that the 330 mhz optical depths are only 0.02 and 0.05 for g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 , respectively .",
    "there is some indication in our @xmath108 resolution 74 mhz image that g11.2@xmath20.3 suffers from more absorption on its eastern side than the western side , but this will need to be confirmed by higher resolution 74 mhz data .",
    "the hii region g11.11@xmath20.4 located just south of g11.2@xmath20.3 ( see figure 1a ) , is a potential candidate to provide an absorbing ehe if its distance along the line of site is closer to us than that of the remnant .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular gas associated with this hii region are consistent with a location in the 3 kpc arm of the galaxy , suggesting that the distance to the hii region is @xmath109 kpc , similar to that of the snr @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of hi absorption toward both g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.11@xmath20.4 will be needed to better determine their relative distances .",
    "no known hii regions are in close enough proximity ( in the plane of the sky ) to g11.4@xmath20.1 ( see figure 1a ) to provide an ehe candidate for this snr .",
    "spatially resolved 74 mhz images have been crucial in determining the nature of the absorbing medium for w49  b @xcite and 3c  391 ( brogan et al . in prep . ) .",
    "future spatially resolved 74 mhz images are likely to be equally important in identifying the source of ionized thermal gas toward g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 .",
    "a number of recent studies that range from analyzing the rate of historical galactic supernovae , the rate of supernovae in the local group of galaxies , to the birth rate of ob stars within 1 kpc of the sun suggest that the rate of galactic supernovae is about 1 per 50 years ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if we assume that supernova remnants can be distinguished from the galactic background nonthermal emission for about 50,000 to 100,000 yrs then there should be on the order of 1000 to 2000 snrs in our galaxy today .",
    "this number is far below the number of currently known galactic snrs , @xmath8 @xcite .    for some time",
    ", observational selection effects have been thought to be the responsible for the low number of galactic snrs currently known ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these selection effects include ( 1 ) the difficulties associated with detecting the more mature , large , faint remnants in the inner galaxy due to confusion with the galactic synchrotron background radiation ; ( 2 ) the challenges involved with identifying small , young shell type snrs that can be easily confused with steep spectrum extragalactic sources ; ( 3 ) difficulties with distinguishing young and older shell type remnants when they are confused with hii regions that lie along the line of sight ; and ( 4 ) about @xmath24 of snrs known as plerions have no identifiable shell , and have flat spectra so that they are difficult to distinguish from hii regions , even in high resolution images ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the solution to the first problem is obviously to make high surface brightness sensitivity observations , while the second requires high spatial resolution in the hopes of resolving a candidate snrs shell morphology .",
    "the solution to number ( 3 ) is to obtain equally sensitive , high resolution multi - wavelength data so that sources of thermal emission can be separated from nonthermal emission .",
    "the solutions to number ( 4 ) include looking for strong linear polarization , or an associated pulsar .    in the @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field centered on g11.2@xmath20.3",
    "we have overcome the first three of the above mentioned problems by obtaining high surface brightness sensitivity , high resolution , multi - wavelength data .",
    "these data have resulted in the discovery of three new snrs .",
    "all three new remnants appear fairly old and at least based on the somewhat dubious @xmath68 relation , are located on the other side of the galaxy ( 16 to 24 kpc ) .",
    "we have not identified any new young snrs in this field . however , statistically this is not surprising since this field also contains the historical remnant g11.2@xmath20.3 from a.d .",
    "386 , and we have only sampled a small fraction of the inner galactic plane . if we define `` young '' snrs as having ages less than 2,000 years , then assuming one snr every 50 years implies that there are @xmath110 such `` young '' remnants in the galaxy .",
    "there are only six known historical remnants ( meaning that sightings of their optical emission were recorded in historical documents ) : the crab , sn1006 , 3c  58 , tycho , kepler , and g11.2@xmath20.3 , plus a handful of suspected `` young '' snrs including casa .",
    "thus there are on the order of 30 `` young '' snrs that have yet to be discovered .",
    "these snrs are presumably missing from the historical records because the optical emission from their initial explosions were obscured by intervening material .",
    "indeed , five of the six historical snrs described above , are a degree or more off the plane .    extrapolating from this approximately 1  deg@xmath1 field of view",
    ", we can estimate how many snrs should be detected in our planned 330  mhz survey of the inner galaxy , from @xmath111 with @xmath112 . for this estimate",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that the distribution of snrs within this strip of the galactic plane is fairly uniform .",
    "however , this assumption could be violated if some lines of site pass through more spiral arms than others .",
    "@xcite have recently completed a new analysis of the galactic free electron distribution determined from pulsar dispersion measurements ( this work extends and improves upon the original study by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the galactic electron distribution and many other lines of evidence",
    ", these authors have also developed a an updated model for the galactic spiral arm structure .",
    "the @xcite spiral arm model suggests that there are two potential disparities in the total number of spiral arms in the longitude range @xmath111 .",
    "these include the fact that ( 1 ) the norma arm does not appear to extend beyond @xmath113 on the near side of the galactic center ; and ( 2 ) the crux - scutum arm does not appear to extend to longitudes smaller than @xmath114 on the far side of the galactic center .",
    "an even greater discrepancy is possible if a line of site passes through a tangent point of a spiral arm where gas , hii regions , and presumably snrs tend to pile up",
    ". this may well be the true for lines of site near @xmath115 . in any case",
    ", the region near @xmath116 does not appear to be a particularly special one within the @xmath117 range , suggesting that this field of view should not be overdense with snrs compared to the rest of the survey region .",
    "the above caveats aside , the results from our @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field toward g11.2@xmath20.3 suggest that near @xmath118 , the density of snrs in this part of the galactic plane could be as high as 5 per deg@xmath1 .",
    "we will sample approximately 32 deg@xmath1 in our survey , but we assume that only the @xmath119 deg@xmath1 near @xmath118 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) has an snr density of 5 per deg@xmath1 , with the extra area accounting somewhat for density variations .",
    "these assumptions imply a total snr count in the @xmath121 and @xmath122 region of @xmath123 .",
    "this number is in reasonable agreement with that predicted by @xcite for this region of the galactic plane ( 63 ) based on a galaxy wide treatment of snr densities . within the bounds of our future survey region ,",
    "only 14 snrs are currently known @xcite ! only the actual results from our more extensive survey will determine whether this estimate is realistic , but in any case it will go along way toward determining the true distribution of galactic snrs .",
    "in a @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field of view centered on the known galactic snr g11.2@xmath20.3 , we have identified three new snrs .",
    "previously , this field was thought to contain only two snrs .",
    "the integrated spectral indices of the new snrs : a : g11.15@xmath20.71 , b : g11.03@xmath20.05 , and c : g11.18 + 0.11 range from @xmath6 to @xmath5 .",
    "two of the new snrs ( g11.03@xmath20.05 and g11.18 + 0.11 ) have confusing hii regions nearby ( along the line of sight ) that are not spatially resolved from the snrs at the resolution of the bonn 2695 mhz survey , and this fact is likely responsible for their not having been previously identified .",
    "we have also confirmed the low frequency spectral turnover in the integrated radio continuum spectra of g11.2@xmath20.3 and g11.4@xmath20.1 previously observed by @xcite that is due to free - free absorption along the line of sight .",
    "the addition of our new data suggest that the optical depths toward these snrs at 74 mhz are 0.56 for g11.2@xmath20.3 and 1.1 for g11.4@xmath20.1 .",
    "the upper limits for the 74 mhz integrated flux densities for the three new snrs also suggest that these remnants suffer from absorption .",
    "while quite uncertain , a recent formulation of the @xmath68 relation predicts a nearly correct distance to g11.2@xmath20.3 ( 6 kpc ) and distances of 9 , 24 , 16 , and 17 , kpc for g11.4@xmath20.1 , g11.15@xmath20.71 , g11.03@xmath20.05 , and g11.18 + 0.11 , respectively .",
    "based on this `` test field '' we can say with confidence that high surface brightness sensitivity combined with high spatial resolution low frequency radio observations are an effective tool in the quest to find the `` missing '' galactic snrs  at least the more evolved ones . while single dish surveys have been invaluable for finding the majority of snrs known today , they are ineffective at finding faint , older remnants due to confusion with the galactic background synchrotron emission , snrs that are confused with thermal sources , and young small snrs due to insufficient resolution .",
    "interferometers overcome these problems by resolving out the galactic background while providing high surface brightness sensitivity ( assuming the inclusion of short spacing data ) and high spatial resolution .",
    "indeed , with the vla data presented here we have more than doubled the number of snrs in a @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field of view .",
    "however , the addition of new snrs in a single @xmath0  deg@xmath1 field is insufficient to determine whether the selection effects mentioned above can , in fact , account for all the missing remnants , or whether there is a significant missing link in our understanding of the snr production rate . in order to obtain a better statistical sample we are currently carrying out a wider survey from @xmath9 to @xmath10 along the galactic plane at 330 mhz using the vla in its b , c , and d configurations .",
    "the resulting images will have @xmath109 mjy  beam@xmath19 sensitivity and @xmath64 resolution . in combination with the planned extension of the first survey at 1465 mhz to this region of the galactic plane ( r. becker , private communication )",
