    "a majority of long duration grbs ( lasting 10s or more ) detected by the dutch - italian satellite bepposax have detectable @xmath3-ray afterglows .",
    "the afterglow properties of shorter duration bursts is unknown , and it is possible that these bursts go off far away from galactic centers , where the ism density is low .",
    "will such bursts produce observable afterglows ?    the purpose of this paper is to show that all bursts , irrespective of the ism density , should have a detectable afterglow emission . during the grb",
    "the radiation is received from a region of the fireball of angular size @xmath0 along the line of sight to the center of explosion .",
    "emission from higher latitudes , @xmath5 , is received over a time interval that is long compared to the duration of the burst and , although this radiation is relativistically beamed away from the observer , it nevertheless has significant magnitude .",
    "we calculate this emission and apply it to grbs going off in a very low density ism (  2 ) .",
    "we also consider a case where the density of the circum - burst medium drops off abruptly at some radius (  3 ) .",
    "consider a spherical shell moving with lorentz factor @xmath6 . the shell is shock - heated at some initial time and",
    "starts to radiate .",
    "the emissivity in fluid rest frame , @xmath7 , is a function of shell radius @xmath8 and we assume that it is independent of the angle @xmath9 relative to the observer s line of sight toward the center of the shell .",
    "we also assume that due to the radiative electron cooling and the adiabatic expansion of the shell ( or some other process ) the emissivity in the observed energy band drops to zero when the shell radius is @xmath10 .",
    "one can show in this case that the observed peak flux at observer time @xmath11 decreases as @xmath2 and that the observed peak frequency decreases as @xmath1 .",
    "a simple physical explanation for these results is the following .",
    "the flux per unit frequency from a relativistic source moving at an angle @xmath12 is smaller by a factor of @xmath13 compared to the case where the source is moving directly toward the observer ( assume flat spectrum for simplicity ) . integrating over sources located on equal arrival time surface we find the flux ratio to be @xmath14 .",
    "the emission from angle @xmath9 arrives at a time which is larger than the photon arrival time from a source at @xmath15 by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the observer sees the flux falling off as @xmath2 .",
    "the observed frequency ratio in the two cases , for a fixed source frequency , is @xmath17 . a derivation for a more general case is given below .",
    "the flux received at frequency @xmath18 from a shell moving with lorentz factor @xmath6 and velocity @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath9 is the angle between fluid velocity and the line of sight to the observer , and @xmath22 & @xmath7 are the frequency and emissivity in the shell rest frame at radius @xmath8 and laboratory frame time @xmath23 . for a shell of thickness @xmath24 ( in the lab frame ) much smaller than @xmath8 ,",
    "the angular integration in the above equation can be carried out to yield @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "let us assume that the observed spectrum during the grb phase , i.e. before the shell cools , is a power - law function of index @xmath27 between the observed energy band and the peak of the spectrum : @xmath28 , and that , as @xmath9 is varied , the co - moving frame observing frequency does not pass through any breaks . in this case we can rewrite equation ( [ fnu2 ] ) as @xmath29^{2- \\beta } }",
    "\\;. \\label{fnu3}\\ ] ]    as mentioned above , we consider the case where the injection of accelerated electrons stops at a certain radius @xmath10 .",
    "this can happen either because the internal shock has finished traversing the shell or because the density of the ism drops by a large factor . in both cases",
    "the electrons undergo adiabatic cooling beyond @xmath10 which leads to a sharp fall off of @xmath30 ( see  3 ) ; for radiative electrons @xmath30 drops off even faster .",
    "the integrand in equation ( [ fnu3 ] ) is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath8 , hence most of the contribution comes from @xmath31 , and the peak flux is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the peak frequency @xmath35 of the observed flux decreases with time as @xmath36    for a shell that is energized by the collision with another shell ( i.e. internal shocks ) and expands in vacuum , @xmath37 is also a measure of the duration @xmath38 of the pulse emitted by the shell . for @xmath39 ,",
    "equations ( [ fnum ] ) and ( [ num ] ) become @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for power - law spectra",
    ", the observed flux at a frequency @xmath18 can be calculated from equations ( [ fnu3 ] ) & ( [ fnum1 ] ) : @xmath43    for a grb consisting of @xmath44 pulses the high latitude afterglow flux is the sum of flux from each pulse given in equation ( [ fnu4 ] ) . for an average peak amplitude of @xmath45 ,",
    "the afterglow flux is approximately equal to @xmath46 ; where @xmath47 is the duration of the grb .",
    "the low energy power - law index for grbs is in the range of @xmath48 and 2 with the peak of the distribution at @xmath49 , and the high energy index is between @xmath50 and @xmath51 with peak at @xmath52 ( preece et al .",
    "thus the low energy light - curve for naked bursts is expected to fall - off as @xmath2 , whereas the light - curve at high energy should decline as @xmath53 .",
    "for synchrotron emission the spectral index below the peak is @xmath54 and the afterglow from high latitude emission is expected to decline like @xmath55 until the synchrotron peak passes through the observing band .    as an example , consider a naked grb lasting for 10 seconds and with a mean flux of @xmath56 and the spectral peak at a few hundred kev . at @xmath4 seconds after the burst",
    "the spectral peak is in the 210 kev band and the flux is @xmath57 ( see figure 1 ) . assuming that the optical emission is not self - absorbed , the optical flux at @xmath58 s corresponds to @xmath59",
    ".    the high latitude emission should be detectable by the swift satellite as an @xmath3-ray afterglow following short duration grbs , which are perhaps produced as a result of neutron star merger in a low density medium .",
    "some of the early @xmath3-ray afterglows observed by bepposax have a power - law decay of index of @xmath60 , which could have had a contribution from the high latitude emission . in the few cases where an @xmath3-ray afterglow was continuously monitored for @xmath61 seconds after the main burst ( i.e. grb 910402  tkachenko et al .",
    "2000 , grb 920723  burenin et al . 1999 , and grb 980923 ",
    "giblin et al . 1999 ) , the @xmath3-ray light - curve exhibited a decay significantly slower than what is expected from the high - latitude emission , implying that the emission from the external shock must have been dominant from very early times .",
    "the ratio of the observed flux from the shocked ism gas and the high latitude emission ( @xmath62 ) depends on burst parameters and , generally , on the density of the ism .",
    "an important time time scale for this comparison is the shell deacceleration time @xmath63 sec ; where @xmath64 is isotropic equivalent of energy in observed gamma - ray emission in units of @xmath65 erg , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the initial lorentz factor of ejecta , and @xmath68 is the efficiency factor for converting energy in explosion to the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "we consider @xmath69 less than or greater than the grb duration , @xmath70 , separately below .",
    "let us first consider @xmath71 . for a ism density ( @xmath72 ) larger than @xmath73 and for @xmath74 ,",
    "the soft @xmath3-ray domain is above the cooling frequency after the grb , and in this case @xmath62 is independent of @xmath72 . for an electron energy index @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the observed peak of the grb spectrum",
    ", @xmath18 is the frequency for the afterglow observation , and @xmath78 is the energy fraction in electrons in external shock . for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , the emission from the external shock is larger by about a factor of 5 at the end of the grb .",
    "this result has a weak dependence on @xmath83 .    for @xmath84 ,",
    "as is expected for low density ism , and the observing frequency smaller than the cooling frequency , and for @xmath75 & @xmath85 , we find @xmath86 ; @xmath87 is frequency in units of 10 kev . as an example , for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath79 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93s , the two emissions are equal at the deacceleration time for @xmath94 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "@xmath18 greater than the cooling frequency , and @xmath85 , @xmath95 .",
    "one should be able to separate out the contributions of the high latitude and shocked gas emissions by using the difference in their spectra and light - curve slopes : the @xmath3-ray spectra for shocked low density ism is @xmath96 whereas the high-@xmath9 spectrum is the low energy part of the grb spectrum , i.e. @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "in this section we consider an external shock propagating in a ism which consists of two regions of different densities .",
    "the model we consider consists of a fireball that shock the interstellar medium , producing a standard afterglow emission , and then at some radius @xmath99 the density of the medium drops precipitously and the shell expands adiabatically so that the thermal energy of protons , electrons and magnetic field is converted back to the bulk kinetic energy of the shell .",
    "we follow the shell evolution and synchrotron radiation starting from the time of the free expansion of the shell .",
    "the thermal lorentz factor of particles , in an adiabatically expanding shell , decreases as @xmath100 , and the bulk lorentz factor of the shell ( @xmath6 ) increases with time as @xmath101 ; where @xmath102 is the co - moving volume of the shell , and @xmath103 is the co - moving shell thickness .",
    "we consider the collimation angle @xmath104 of the ejecta to be constant in which case the thermal lorentz factor decreases with @xmath8 as @xmath105 , and the bulk lorentz factor of the shell increases as @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the evolution of the thermal lorentz factor is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the bulk lorentz factor and the observer time respectively at the onset of the free adiabatic expansion .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor @xmath110 .    the magnetic field strength , assuming that it is tangled , decreases as @xmath111 .",
    "thus the peak synchrotron frequency , in the observer frame , scales as @xmath112 , and the peak flux @xmath113 .",
    "the flux at a frequency greater than the synchrotron peak @xmath114 but smaller than the cooling frequency @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 and the power - law index @xmath117 is @xmath118    therefore the afterglow light - curve steepens continuously ; in the beginning of the adiabatic expansion @xmath119 while at @xmath120 , @xmath121 , assuming that @xmath122 .",
    "as the light - curve slope increases with time , the flux from higher latitudes takes over . for a shell interacting with a uniform circum - burst material at @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and thus @xmath125 . for @xmath126 equation ( [ fnum ] ) gives @xmath127 therefore the high latitude emission prevents @xmath128 from becoming larger than @xmath129 .",
    "these results apply over a limited range of @xmath130 . at late times",
    "the non - zero density of the ism prevents the free expansion of the shell and the freshly shock - heated gas contributes to the observed flux .",
    "the free expansion of the shell is terminated when the mass of the swept - up low density gas is @xmath131 , @xmath132 being the energy of the adiabatic shell .",
    "thus the radius at which the free adiabatic expansion is terminated is @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the densities of the high and low density ism respectively .",
    "the time in the observer frame when the adiabatic expansion ends is @xmath136 for @xmath137 0.1 ( 0.01 ) free expansion is terminated at @xmath138 ( 4.2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath128 reverts back to @xmath139 when the emission from shocked low - density ism takes over . at the time when the adiabatic expansion of the shell ends",
    "the ratio of the flux from the low density shocked gas to the flux at @xmath109 is @xmath140 . if the fractional energies in electrons , @xmath78 , and magnetic field , @xmath141 , are same for shock in the high and low density ism then the flux at @xmath142 due to high latitude emission and the low density shocked gas are approximately equal for @xmath143 .",
    "since the observed flux for frequency between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath144 , values of @xmath78 & @xmath141 for the shocked lower density medium smaller by a factor of 10 could reduce the flux from the low density shock gas so that the high - latitude emission dominates for @xmath145 , and during this period the power - law index of the light - curve is @xmath146 ; for @xmath147 , @xmath148 .    the optical light - curve of the afterglow of grb 000301c fell off as @xmath149 for the first three days and subsequently steepened to @xmath150 ( rhoads & fruchter 2000 ) . from simultaneous optical ",
    "ir observations rhoads & fruchter ( 2000 ) and sagar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have found that @xmath151 at @xmath152 days .",
    "a possible explanation for the steep decay seen at late time in this afterglow is that the ism density fell off at some radius and the subsequently observed afterglow emission arose at @xmath153 , yielding a power - law decaying light - curve of index @xmath154 , which is consistent with the data .",
    "figure 2 shows the observed @xmath155-band data for grb 000301c and the theoretically calculated light - curve based on the model described here .",
    "the transition time for light - curve steepening is @xmath156 , which is roughly consistent with the observations .",
    "it has been shown by kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) that the time - scale for light - curve steepening due to jet edge effects in a homogeneous ism is roughly comparable .",
    "the late time power - law index according to the jet model is @xmath157 for adiabatic electrons radiating at optical frequencies , which is also consistent with the data .",
    "the different relationship between @xmath128 and @xmath27 in these two models can be used to distinguish between them .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that gamma - ray bursts going off in vacuum  _",
    "naked _ grbs  should have @xmath3-ray afterglow emission detectable by the @xmath3-ray telescope aboard swift satellite for about an hour after the grb .",
    "this radiation originates at the high latitude , @xmath12 , part of the gamma - ray emission surface .",
    "the flux in a fixed observer energy band below the peak falls off as @xmath55 , while the peak flux decreases as @xmath2 .",
    "the peak frequency of the observed flux falls - off as @xmath1 .    for a burst going off in a non - zero density ism the early afterglow flux , within the first hour , is the sum of emission from high latitude and the shocked ism .",
    "the two can be distinguished based on the differences between their spectral and temporal slopes ; the @xmath3-ray spectrum for the shocked ism is @xmath158 , whereas for the high latitude radiation the spectrum should be the same as the grb spectrum at low energies , i.e. @xmath159 . the measurement of the high latitude afterglow emission should help map the irregularities in the ejecta producing the grb and their collimation before these are detected in the emission from the shocked ism .",
    "the radiation emitted from latitudes @xmath160 sets an upper bound on the steepness of the flux decline : we expect the observed @xmath161-ray flux for each individual peak within the burst to fall off less rapidly than @xmath162 , where @xmath130 is measured from the peak of the pulse and @xmath27 is the spectral index ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "a more rapid flux decline would be an indication of either an extremely small jet opening - angle or a very inhomogeneous shell , as in the model suggested by kumar & piran ( 2000 ) .",
    "another straightforward consequence of the high latitude emission is that the power - law decline for the afterglow light - curve can not be larger than about 3 , even when the fireball expands into vacuum . the observed late time power - law index for the light - curve of grb 000301c is about 3 , which is larger by about 2 compared to the early time index .",
    "this large and rapid steepening of the light - curve could arise when the late time light - curve is dominated by emission from high latitudes .",
