    "massive stars are the principal source of heavy elements and ultraviolet radiation , and a major supplier of wind and supernova energy , within the universe .",
    "individually , they dominate cluster formation and , collectively , they influence the evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , our knowledge of massive stars remains limited .",
    "we know they are born in massive and dense clumps embedded within giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "we also think we understand fairly well how physical mechanisms conspire to describe the emergence of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "but the events which conspire to produce the high - mass counterparts are still controversial .",
    "this is due to a combination of factors including their rarity , large distances , rapid evolution , high extinction and their confusion with associated clusters .",
    "a formation model requires integration of evolutionary models for the internal star , the environment and the feedback .",
    "together , these constitute a ` protostellar system ' which consists of several distinct components including a hydrostatic core , disk , envelope , wind , jets and bipolar outflow .",
    "recently , with herschel , blast and planck following spitzer , we have acquired the quality and quantity of data to explore the early formation stages",
    ". processes that can now be addressed include clump dispersal , cluster formation , mass inflow , stellar accretion , stellar flux and mass outflow .",
    "the aim here is to link the system components and underlying processes together through a model framework that predicts resulting observable correlations .",
    "we thus develop a scheme which explores plausible paths from clump to exposed star .",
    "it is set up to track how mass is passed between the components , while accounting for direct ejection from the supplying clump and indirect ejection through jets .",
    "the interaction of a gradually emerging star with a massive clump is described in terms of a time sequence going from compact and hot molecular cores to extended hii regions as expansion occurs .",
    "this has emphasized an issue concerning the time scales with too many bound hypercompact or the later ultracompact hii regions being observed .",
    "this may be resolved by taking less ideal approaches to accretion and dispersal from and to the clump @xcite , allowing for choking of the cavity through the infall of dense filaments and fragments of the clump .",
    "the very early stages of protostar formation within cold clumps have now been identified in large numbers as infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) @xcite .",
    "these could be the star - less objects from which massive stars will form .",
    "however , the earliest signs of accretion have also been signposted by directed outflows of cold molecular gas and , it turns out , most of the irdcs studied so far host weak 24@xmath0 m emission sources and already drive molecular outflows , both strong indicators for active star formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the herschel space telescope has helped reveal the full population of early evolutionary stages at the very onset of massive star formation .",
    "it has been proposed that the large - scale evolution can be split into two phases : an accretion phase and a clean - up phase .",
    "initially , as the protostar gains in mass , its sphere of influence grows , leading to accelerated accretion @xcite .",
    "there is observational support for this as discussed by @xcite which favours either turbulent core @xcite or competitive accretion @xcite models .",
    "subsequently , in a distinct second phase , termed the clean - up phase , the accretion has stopped abruptly and the remaining clump material is partly dispersed or integrated into a surrounding cluster .    in another scenario , the massive star does not fully form early .",
    "low mass star formation dominates until the clump has considerably evolved .",
    "these stars would remain difficult to detect .",
    "it has been remarked that the current initial mass function implies two peaks of star formation with the majority of low mass stars forming first and high mass stars forming later",
    ". in competitive accretion , gas is funnelling down to the cloud centre where stars , initially accreting gas with low relative velocity , already have large mass before accreting the late - arriving higher velocity gas @xcite .",
    "stellar collisions and mergers could supplement gas accretion @xcite .",
    "massive stars could form via coalescence of intermediate mass stars within very dense systems .",
    "although not considered here , along with other scenarios involving fragmentation , these should lead to alternative predictions .",
    "do high - mass stars form in a scaled - up analogue of the low - mass formation scenario ? find a consistent interpretation in favour of an analogy .",
    "they analysed wide spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to derive bolometric luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and clump mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this leads to the diagnostic diagram of @xmath1 versus @xmath2 ( we have replaced the term envelope with clump here , employing envelope to refer to the inner part of the clump which accretes directly on to the protostar ) .",
    "the high - mass objects were then shown to occupy a sequence of regions on this diagram in a similar manner to those evolving classes which populate the low - mass regions .",
    "herschel data have recently extended this to include protostars .",
    "the sed parameters now available include fluxes derived from the red msx source survey , spitzer irac and mips , sofia forcast , herschel pacs , herschel spire , and blast .",
    "further data are available across the radio , sub - millimetre and infrared . from these",
    ", we can derive clump mass , temperature , luminosity , ultraviolet flux , outflow mass and outflow power .",
    "so we can now construct several diagrams to employ as diagnostic tools to estimate the evolutionary stages .",
    "the bolometric luminosity and temperature , @xmath3 , have been used in isolation to test accretion models for a version of the model tuned to low - mass protostars @xcite . a similar approach but just using the luminosity function was adopted by @xcite for high - mass stars using msx data and radio identifications to distinguish protostars from later stages . in place of an sed derivation of luminosity , the 21@xmath0 m flux was utilised with the assumption that the bolometric luminosity can be taken as a reliable proxy for the set of protostars being investigated .",
    "both these approaches led to constraints on the time scale of young stars and the general form of the accretion process .",
    "a potential test would use the radio luminosity , @xmath4 , produced by free - free emission after extreme ultraviolet excitation .",
    "the ratio of @xmath4/@xmath1 should then provide a measure of the development while @xmath1/ @xmath2 provides a distinct measure .",
    "plotted together , such a diagram provides a _ distance independent _ distribution of evolutionary phases .",
    "outflow parameters have also been used to distinguish the phases of low - mass stars where accretion is known to decelerate rather than accelerate with time .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the force of the outflow as the source ages @xcite .",
    "showed that bipolar outflows are indeed ubiquitous phenomena in the formation process of massive stars , suggesting similar flow - formation scenarios for all masses , consistent again with scaled - up , but otherwise similar , physical processes - mainly accretion - to their low - mass counterparts .",
    "going further , it was shown that the measured molecular hydrogen outflow luminosity is tightly related to the source bolometric luminosity for low mass stars , and this relationship extends to massive objects .",
    "it is clear that this only applies to the youngest protostars in which the bolometric luminosity is dominated by the release of energy through accretion .",
    "those sources associated with jets are very young ( well before the main sequence turn - on ) , while those without detectable jets possess ultracompact hii regions @xcite .",
    "the objectives of this first paper is to set up the model framework and consider the effects of radiation feedback .",
    "we impose simple accretion rates that slowly vary .",
    "subsequent works will tackle accretion outbursts , the outflow properties and the strength of feedback in self - regulation .",
    "the accelerated - accretion model generates a particular @xmath1 versus @xmath2 relation .",
    "we begin here by exploring how general this is .",
    "a constant accretion rate is a common working assumption while there is evidence for both a declining rate as well as a sporadic / episodic rate .",
    "these models involve less dramatic cut - offs in the accretion and should generate models with different statistical properties .",
    "a major issue to address later is the existence of two distinct phases .",
    "if accelerated accretion is followed by a clean - up phase , we expect the outflow feedback phase to precede the radiative feedback phase .",
    "it may prove difficult for accretion phenomena to still dominate once the rapid rise in ultraviolet flux has started at late times .",
    "quite remarkably , nature has no problem : all of the sources with infall signatures onto ultracompact hii regions have corresponding outflow signatures as well @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that accretion may continue , consistent with the gravo - turbulent model",
    ". however , both accretion and collimated outflows are probably weak when the star has advanced to its ultracompact hii stage @xcite .",
    "an ultimate aim of this study will therefore be to determine the conditions under which the accretion - outflow phase can significantly overlap with the uv phase , associated with the final contraction of a massive star .",
    "the model is constructed upon ( 1 ) the extension of the unification scheme for low - mass stars , ( 2 ) the strategy and model invoked for high - mass stars , ( 3 ) the detailed evolutionary tracks of an accreting massive protostar , ( 4 ) the results for a range of potential accretion rates and ( 5 ) predicted outcomes for radiative and outflow feedback . all algorithms and graphics are written and processed in idl .",
    "the first task is the construction of a model for the environment in which a given clump mass , @xmath2 , is redistributed in time according to a prescribed formula , constrained by mass conservation .",
    "the clump directly supplies three entities : an inner envelope .",
    "@xmath5 , a surrounding cluster @xmath6 and dispersal into the ambient cloud @xmath7 ( with some additional help from the jet - driven outflow ) .",
    "the inner envelope is here assumed to supply the accretion disk at a rate @xmath8 which , feeds instantaneously both the star , @xmath9 , and the jets , @xmath10 .",
    "the jet material accumulates in an inner outflow , @xmath11 , which also pushes out a fraction of the clump .",
    "hence : @xmath12 @xmath13    we will consider two important free parameters .",
    "the most critical is the fraction , @xmath14 , of the initial clump mass which ends up as part of the star . even for low mass stars",
    ", it is well known that there must be a much larger obscuring mass than necessary to form the star @xcite .",
    "this mass prolongs the embedded phase and extends the late class 0 and early class 1 stages . the best estimate for the excess mass",
    "was found to be a factor of two in the low - mass version of the present scheme on using accretion rates derived from gravo - turbulent models @xcite .",
    "also for high - mass protostars , the surrounding bound clumps are estimated to exceed the star s mass by a factor which can exceed 30 .",
    "we thus anticipate quite low values for @xmath14 .",
    "hence , in this work , we assume that the clump mass is sufficient to form the protostar and the associated stellar cluster ( see sub - section  [ clumps ] ) in addition to gas expelled directly from the clump .",
    "we assume both mass loss rates to be constant with the same time scale .",
    "the second parameter is the fractional efficiency @xmath15 of mass diversion from inflow to outflow , from the disk to the jets .",
    "the extended magneto - centrifugal model is expected to be quite efficient and the x - wind model is expected to reach the thirty per cent level @xcite . in doing so , such magneto - centrifugal mechanisms can carry away the total angular momentum and kinetic energy of the accreting disk material .",
    "previously , we found that a constant efficiency @xmath15 was inconsistent with the observations of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "hence we took @xmath16^\\zeta , \\label{eqn - hm}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the peak accretion rate and @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "the variable jet efficiency was introduced in order to account for evolving outflow properties of low - mass protostars . the class",
    "0 outflows appear to have a mechanical luminosity of order of the bolometric luminosity of the protostellar core . on the other hand , class",
    "1 outflows have mechanical luminosities and momentum flow rates up to a factor of 10 lower . with the same mass outflow efficiency , @xmath19",
    ", this would then require that the _ jet speed _ is higher in class 0 outflows .",
    "this is , however , contrary to the observations which associate lower velocities ( @xmath20kms@xmath21 ) to the class 0 outflows . here",
    ", we shall assume a constant outflow mass fraction , taking the case @xmath22 throughout this work .    in general",
    ", the mass left over which accretes on to the core to form the star is @xmath23      the mass accretion rate @xmath24 is the main prescribed parameter .",

    "the models are ( i ) constant fast accretion for 10@xmath25  yr ( solid line ) , ( ii ) constant slow accretion for @xmath26  10@xmath27  yr ( long - dashed ) , ( iii ) power law with maximum @xmath28 = 4.01  @xmath26  10@xmath29  m@xmath30  yr@xmath21 ( dashed ) , ( iv ) exponential with maximum @xmath28 = 2.77  @xmath26  10@xmath29  m@xmath30  yr@xmath21 ( dot - dashed ) , and ( v ) accelerated accretion for 10@xmath25  yr ( dotted line ) .

    "it is clear , however , that the rate must eventually fall ( by the pre - main sequence stage for low - mass stars ) as the reservoir becomes exhausted .",
    "here we assume a constant rate until a cut - off time , @xmath31 , at which the accretion is abruptly halted .",

    "one type of model assumes the envelope loses mass in proportional to its mass , @xmath40 .",

    "however , it is no surprise that the results differ according to the precise sample selection criteria      the structure of a protostar while it accretes at a constant rate has been calculated by @xcite in the ` hot accretion ' scenario corresponding to spherical free - fall .",

    "the four functions correspond to the four main stages with smooth interpolation between these stages .",

    "the resulting functions are shown in figs .",
    "[ radius ] and [ luminosity ] .",
    "figure [ luminosity ] displays both the accretion and stellar luminosities , and demonstrates that the accretion luminosity dominates until the radial swelling stage which is apparent as a dip in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the stellar structure depends on the stellar mass , the initial interior state and the accretion rate history . for the case of a constant accretion rate ,",
    "the above published works provide accurate templates for fiducial cases . however , to employ these figures for time - varying accretion , @xcite took the current accretion rate to look up the radius and luminosity from @xcite .",
    "this method may be a reasonable approximation when the accretion rate continues to increase such that most of the mass has been accumulated within a factor of two of the present accretion rate .",
    "more accurately for the adiabatic phases , we here calculate how the star has accumulated the mass and entropy over its entire evolution .",
    "thus a mass - averaged accretion rate , proportional to the accumulated entropy , is employed .",
    "however , this method would still lead to very large errors when the accretion rate varies by large amounts , decreases considerably or varies rapidly in the post - adiabatic stages .    when the above method yields a kelvin - helmholtz time that is comparable or shorter than the accretion time scale , the adiabatic approximation is invalid .",
    "a compromise solution would employ both the current and the mass - avaeraged accretion rates so as to deliver the correct stellar parameters for the two limiting cases of adiabatic accretion and rapid loss of entropy .",
    "this is parameterised with the use of the factor @xmath74 where , as usually defined , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as determined by the mass - averaged accretion rate .",
    "we then take this factor to determine the stellar radius and luminosity relative to the mass averaged values , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , by the additive factors @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the stellar radius calculated from the current rate .",
    "while this compromise is more accurate , this would still lead to spurious properties if accretion variations are very rapid .    in this paper , therefore , we will use a second method , where the structure at any time is determined by the mass - averaged accretion rate over the history of the star limited to the past kelvin - helmholtz time .",
    "we implement an iterative process to determine the radius , luminosity and mass - average accretion rate since these are themselves functions of @xmath81 . upon testing , we find that the maximum difference between the two methods is typically a few per cent and occurs in the kelvin - helmholtz phase . in comparison , simply assuming the current accretion rate and reading the stellar structure from the constant - rate simulations , generated errors of order of 10% in radius throughout the first three evolutionary stages for the slowly varying rates displayed in fig .",

    "a model for massive stars has been constructed by piecing together models for the protostellar structure , the inflow from a large clump and the radiation feedback .",
    "the framework requires the accretion rate from the clump to be specified . in this first work",
    "we consider a specific subset of possible flows .",
    "we consider both hot and cold accretion scenarios , identified as the limiting cases for spherical free - fall and disk accretion , respectively .",
    "we assume the fiducial cases presented by @xcite in the ` hot accretion ' scenario and @xcite for the ` cold accretion ' structure but it should be noted that there is considerable uncertainty , depending on the assumed initial interior state and the physics of the radiation feedback ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "strongly variable accretion rates have been investigated by @xcite as well as @xcite by utilising hydrodynamic simulations . in both these works ,",
    "the puffy extended nature of the protostars is evident .",
    "here we only consider smooth evolutions and do not consider accretion outbursts or pulsations , or the jet and outflow properties .",
    "we also do not consider binary formation , geometry and inclination effects , or the evolution of the size of the hii region .",
    "hence , this first work sets up the fundamental algorithms and compares results for two recent diagnostic tools .",
    "models for the formation of massive stars through accretion can be tested by comparing predictions to a range of observational parameters .",
    "these include the bolometric and extreme ultraviolet luminosities , the envelope and disk mass , and the outflow momentum and energy .",
    "we here determine possible evolutionary tracks on assuming the variation with time of the accretion rate from a molecular clump on to the star and calculate how the star , envelope and outflow simultaneously evolve .",
    "this is achieved by making analytical prescriptions for the components based on current knowledge .",
    "we update and extend previous models and confirm previous conclusions that the clump mass must far exceeds the accreted mass , most of it being converted into a surrounding cluster of low - mass objects or dispersed .",
    "we find that accelerated accretion is not favoured on the basis of the l@xmath118m@xmath119 diagnostic diagram which does not directly provide a test to differentiate the models .",
    "only a slow accretion model can be distinguished in which the star and clump evolve on the same time scale , which is not pursued since it seems unlikely given the contrasting sound - crossing time scales between cores and clumps .",
    "this is mainly because the protostar tends to accrete most of its mass within a short time span in all the other models .    instead , we show that the time spent within each range of bolometric temperature can be closely related to the underlying accretion model .",
    "as shown in table  [ tabletime ] , accelerated accretion generates relatively more sources at low bolometric temperatures .",
    "sets of far - infrared herschel data covering the temperature range from 20k ",
    "70k should provide some insight .",
    "however , modelling and observations of the bolometric temperature both remain problematic especially at the low temperatures which can be dominated by unbound non - stellar and pre stellar objects in addition to agb stars .",
    "however , we find a solution which fits the data in which the initial clump mass is four to five times larger than that necessary to generate the associated star cluster corresponding to the mass of the most massive star .",
    "we thus generate revised evolutionary tracks which are consistent with statistics for the bolometric temperature . in these revised models , the star remains deeply embedded throughout its formation and the bolometric temperature distribution is no longer a sensitive diagnostic to differentiate between accretion models .",
    "accretion models may be better tested through a complete sample of hotter protostars with temperatures in the range 50k to 100k .",
    "in addition , as with their low - mass counterparts , large periodic accretion variations could dominate the statistics .",
    "the accelerated accretion model has been advanced in the literature because we expect the gravitational sphere of influence of a central object to grow as its mass grows . here",
    ", however , with the large accretion rates often assumed , we take an inner envelope to already exist with sufficient mass to meet the later needs of the star and outflow . in this case",
    ", the accretion rate depends on how fast mass can flow in from the envelope , through the disk , rather than how massive the central protostar has become .",
    "finally , we have investigated lyman fluxes as deduced observationally from radio fluxes .",
    "observationally , it has been shown that objects of luminosity @xmath163 10,000  l@xmath30 can possess very high lyman fluxes , inconsistent with their expected stellar temperatures .",
    "we have shown here that the problem is resolvable if the protostar is relatively compact , formed through cold accretion via a disk .",
    "however , the present accretion must involve a funnelling free - fall mechanism onto a fraction of the stellar surface estimated to be less than 10% .",
    "the mechanism for this remains unknown but if the evidence that massive protostars are configured in the same way as low - mass stars continues to grow , then accretion via magnetic flux tubes and jets driven by magneto - centrifugal processes are conceivable .",
    "the above explanation of the excess lyman photon flux requires evolution under the cold accretion scenario .",
    "hot accretion falls far short even with the inclusion of hot - spots , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ lognolyhot ] .",
    "cold accretion was defined as accretion on to the photosphere with no back - heating , so that the accreting material has the same entropy as that of the photosphere @xcite .",
    "this is a limiting case which may be difficult to realise .",
    "it could be generally expected that the rapid mass accretion should be somewhat hot because a fraction of the entropy should be advected into the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "taking larger protostellar radii will reduce the lyman flux ; taking radii 50% higher than that predicted for cold accretion , however , does not significantly alter the qualitative of fit to the atca data while doubling the radius has a considerable effect .",
    "accurate results will require the implementation of a full stellar evolution code .",
    "the major objective here has been to construct a consistent model which links the components . in the following works",
    ", we will investigate the consequences of mass outflows , accretion variations , maser production , thermal radio jets and h  ii regions with the purpose of determining how their evolutions are coordinated .",
