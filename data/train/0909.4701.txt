    "one of the most fascinating challenges in gauge theories of fundamental interactions today , is the implementation of a natural mechanism providing a satisfactory explanation of the observed hierarchical fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing .",
    "concentrating on the hadronic sector in particular , we know today experimentally with remarkable accuracy the quark masses and the cabbibo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) mixing which arises because the yukawa matrices are not diagonal in flavor space .",
    "this mixing determines the strengths of the transitions between the various quark flavors explaining the observations related to the cp - violation in the neutral kaon system and other interesting processes involving quark flavor physics  .    since the birth of modern gauge theories and the establishment of the standard model , the problem of mass hierarchy and flavor mixing",
    "have been tackled in many ways . among the various attempts , abelian and several",
    "discrete symmetries  @xcite were often ` mobilized ' to discriminate fermion families , supplying thus the theory with more or less realistic textures which reproduce the observed fermion mass spectrum .",
    "it was subsequently shown that such @xmath0 family symmetries arise naturally in the context of string models  . as a result ,",
    "a generic characteristic of these constructions is that at the tree - level superpotential only one fermion generation ( usually the third ) of yukawa couplings is allowed .",
    "the remaining two fermion families obtain their masses from higher order non - renormalizable ( nr ) terms when the various singlet or any other higgs fields appearing in the string spectrum obtain vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , breaking thus the surplus @xmath0 symmetries and filling in the tree - level zeroes of the mass matrices with subleading mass terms .",
    "as the latter are mainly correlated to the lighter generations a consistent quark mass hierarchy arises in a natural way .",
    "searching for simplicity and maximal predictability on the fermion mass problem , a purely phenomenological approach restricted to symmetric matrices only , revealed that admissible fermion mass textures can be classified to five texture - zero mass matrices which contain all relevant information and reproduce the low energy measurements  @xcite .",
    "all these textures exhibit a hierarchical structure in the sense that the magnitudes of the non - zero entries coupled to heavier generations are bigger than those coupled to the lighter ones .",
    "d - brane models however have paved the way for new interesting possibilities .",
    "recently , a closer look at the phenomenological properties of the predicted superpotential terms has revealed that completely novel structures of non - symmetric mass matrices may appear  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in a wide class of these constructions",
    "this mainly happens because of constraints originating not only from @xmath0 symmetries , but also from restrictions imposed by tadpole and other anomaly cancelation conditions .",
    "for example , in d - brane models built in the context of the standard model symmetry , quark and lepton fields should be distributed between equal numbers of @xmath1 and @xmath2 representations . if we confine ourselves to cases of d - brane configurations with the minimal sm spectrum , we find that the consrtaints are automatically satisfied for the @xmath3 color group , however , the implementation for the case of the @xmath4 doublets imposes additional restrictions on the yukawa sector .",
    "these restrictions lead to rather peculiar mass matrix structures where the magnitudes of the non - zero entries do not follow a hierarchical pattern in the sense that was described above .    some of these models may prove to be ephemeral , but",
    ", they undoubtedly indicate that there are lots of surprises on the way , thus a detailed analysis towards a complete classification of mass matrix textures consistent with the fermion masses and mixing is needed .    in the present paper , motivated by recent activity on d - brane phenomenological explorations related to the origin of fermion masses and their hierarchies , we elaborate on the issue of fermion mass spectrum in sm d - brane variants and develop a method to construct new viable mass textures , concentrating mainly on the quark sector .",
    "our results , are more general and can be applied to the charged lepton and the neutrino sector as well .",
    "we treat symmetric and non - symmetric mass matrices on an equal footing , by working out the triangular ( cholesky ) form of the admissible mass matrices which encodes all the physical properties in a unique way .",
    "it is shown that all matrix elements can be analytically expressed in terms of simple unique functions of the quark masses and the corresponding elements of diagonalizing matrix .",
    "this latter ( cholesky ) form of the @xmath5 fermion mass textures can be considered to act as a _ progenitor _ of equivalent classes of admissible symmetric and non - symmetric matrices connected by orthogonal matrices acting on it .",
    "we further pursue our approach by using the cayley - hamilton theorem to develop a new more compact formalism for the orthogonal transformations that facilitates the analysis of the diagonalizing matrices and reveals the geometrical nature of the multiplication properties on computations regarding the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing and the quark mass spectrum .",
    "thus geometrical treatment provides also the tools to investigate cases where up and down quark matrices are misaligned and considerable adjustments are necessary to obtain the ckm mixing .",
    "this happens for example in f - theory constructions  @xcite,@xcite , when matter curves for up and down quarks intersect at different points  @xcite-@xcite .    in the present analysis",
    "we will not deal with corrections attributed to renormalization group evolution .",
    "thus , for demonstration purposes , experimentally measured quantities ( like masses and mixing ) at the electroweak scale will be used as if the mass matrices were obtained at low energy scales .",
    "this is very reasonable for d - brane models with low unification scale , however , more precise quantitative estimates for high unification scale scenarios can be easily obtained by taking into account the radiative corrections which can be easily parametrized in terms of one parameter only  @xcite .    the present paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive the yukawa superpotential in the context of a standard model variant emerging from a simple d - brane configuration and construct the quark mass matrices with the aforementioned characteristics .",
    "a short exploration of the magnitude of the yukawa terms with respect to their particular origin is carried out and a new vector - like parametrization of the matrices is proposed which facilitates the subsequent analysis .",
    "a characteristic case of the derived quark mass textures is worked out is detail and the compatibility of the findings with the low experimental energy data are discussed . in section 3",
    "we introduce the cholesky form of the mass matrices and explore the mathematical properties which will enable us to classify the admissible quark mass textures .",
    "we show how the triangular ( cholesky ) form of a mass matric acts as a ` progenitor ' of an equivalent class of symmetric and non - symmetric mass matrices with the same ` physical ' properties , i.e. , the same eigenmasses and mixing .",
    "then , in section 4 we introduce a new parametrization of the orthogonal transformations and use the analysis of the previous section to express analytically the entries of the triangular matrix as functions of the mass eigenstates and the diagonalizing matrix elements .",
    "an investigation on simplified phenomenologically viable texture - zero forms of the triangular matrix is made in section 5 .",
    "a separate discussion is also devoted on comparison issues of the present approach and the symmetric texture - zeroes in the existing literature .",
    "the conditions on the parameter space in a class of texture - zeroes matrices to obtain consistency of the d - brane inspired matrices and examples are worked out in detail in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we present our conclusions while in section 8 we include further details of our calculations .",
    "in order to demonstrate the existence of the novel class of mass matrices in this section we proceed with the analysis of the yukawa sector of one particular example based on the simplest and most economical d - brane configuration which can incorporate the standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry .",
    "we should point out however , that the peculiar textures derived here are by no means a narrow characteristic of this chosen model .",
    "delving into the variety of the d - brane sm constructions , one can find that this specific mass pattern appears in a wide class of intersecting d - brane sm models  @xcite,@xcite , in gepner constructions  @xcite,@xcite as well as in certain guts  @xcite .    in all those d - brane analogues of the old successful gauge models ,",
    "additional restrictions are imposed on the matter representations due to the tadpole and anomaly cancelation conditions .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath6 factor of the gauge symmetry @xmath7 , implied by a d - brane configuration , tadpole cancelation conditions demand equal number of @xmath8 and @xmath9 representations .    in the case of d - brane successors of the standard model gauge symmetry   with minimal quark and charged lepton sector , as far as the @xmath10 representations are concerned",
    ", this requirement is automatically satisfied .",
    "furthermore , in order to implement this condition for the @xmath11 gauge factor , one has to discriminate between @xmath4 doublet and anti - doublet fields and ensure that equal numbers are predicted for both in the massless spectrum . as a consequence , at least in the simplest and more appealing cases with the minimal spectrum ,",
    "not all quark doublet fields arise from the same intersection , and therefore matter fields belonging to different generations definitely carry unrelated @xmath0 quantum numbers .    in this context , simple hierarchical symmetric textures which were usually discussed in the literature",
    "are far from being realistic and one has to confront the mass texture problem in a more general context . in this section",
    "we demonstrate this fact by giving one such simple example implying representative quark mass textures of these constructions .",
    "we assume a d - brane configuration  @xcite with three stacks ( call them @xmath12 ) which generatethe @xmath13 , gauge symmetries respectively ( the relevant d - brane configuration is depicted in figure [ f1 ] ) .    a depiction of the @xmath14 d - brane configuration with strings representing the sm states . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "@xmath12 denote @xmath15 and @xmath0 branes respectively . in this figure d",
    "- branes are not distinguished from their corresponding mirrors .",
    "thus , the blue string representing the quark doublet @xmath16 is stretched between the @xmath17 and the mirror @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , one endpoint of the `` @xmath19-string '' is attached on the mirror @xmath20.,scaledwidth=28.0% ]    these are sufficient to incorporate the standard model gauge symmetry together with its minimal fermion and higgs spectrum which is shown in table [ u321 ] .",
    "this consists of the three sm fermion generations , enlarged by the corresponding right handed neutrinos and one pair of higgs doublets .",
    "it can be checked that anomaly cancelation conditions are also satisfied .",
    ".the quantum numbers of the sm fermions in the @xmath21 brane configuration .",
    "the last column is the hypercharge @xmath22 while three previous ones refer to the @xmath0 charges with respect to the @xmath12 brane - stacks.[u321 ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     all the three possible cases @xmath23 can be obtained choosing appropriate values of the free parameter @xmath24 and are presented respectively in tables [ 1zt1],[1zt2 ] and [ 1zt3 ] .",
    "these matrices are ostensibly different , however they encode the same physical properties , i.e. , they result to the same eigenvalues of @xmath25 and predict the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "in this work we have examined the fermion masses in a wide class of effective low energy models emerging from intersecting d - brane configurations where the yukawa superpotential terms are subject to additional restrictions from surplus @xmath0 symmetries and anomaly cancelation conditions .",
    "we have shown that masses for all fermion generations are obtained only when additional higgs doublets , or higher order corrections or substantially suppressed non - perturbative effects are taken into account .",
    "we have worked out in detail the spectrum of a representative model with standard model gauge symmetry augmented by abelian factors and we have observed that the fermion mass matrices exhibit a characteristic pattern which appears in a wide class of models obtained in the context of d - brane scenarios .",
    "we investigated specific cases of these novel patterns derived for the quark mass matrices and analyzed in detail the conditions imposed by phenomenological constraints on the various mass generating mechanisms in these constructions .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the above considerations , in this work we developed a novel formalism which leads to a unified treatment of all viable symmetric and non - symmetric fermion mass textures .",
    "more precisely , we showed that the cholesky decomposition of the mass matrices captures the features in a unique way of a whole equivalent class of mass matrices which are related to the former by an orthogonal matrix .",
    "the entries of the corresponding triangular ( cholesky ) mass matrix were determined analytically in terms of the eigenmasses and the diagonalizing matrix while they were used to explore equivalent classes of symmetric and non - symmetric quark mass matrices which reconcile the hierarchical quark mass pattern and the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix .",
    "we have further shown that the triangular form of the quark mass matrices admit texture - zero forms , minimizing thus the number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented for the d - brane derived quark mass patterns and conditions on the various mass generating sources are specified to reconcile the known mass hierarchies and mixing data .",
    "finally , a comparison with the symmetric texture - zero quark mass matrices existing in the literature is also worked out .",
