    "the unification of gauge coupling constants is an attractive proposal under the name of grand unification@xcite , which can not be understood in the standard model(sm ) . at the unification scale",
    "@xmath7 the strong , weak and electromagnetic coupling constants are the same since they are described by a simple or semi - simple group @xmath8 for grand unification . below the unification scale , this grand unification(gut ) group @xmath8 is broken down to the standard model group @xmath9 and the difference between the sm couplings is generated@xcite . since the gut unifies the interactions and some quarks and leptons",
    "are assigned in a same @xmath8 multiplet , the quark and lepton transition is possible in guts , triggering proton to decay . the lepto - quark gauge bosons and colored scalars are responsible for proton decay . the lepto - quark gauge boson mass is the unification scale @xmath7 .",
    "but the higgs multiplet containing the sm higgs doublet must contain a light spectrum for the doublet .",
    "the colored partner of the doublet must be superheavy , or proton lifetime is absurdly short , @xmath10 seconds , for o(1 ) couplings .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 of @xmath0 contains a higgs doublet field @xmath12 and color triplet field @xmath13 , where it is assumed that @xmath4 is light and @xmath14 is superheavy .",
    "there exists the difficulty in splitting the doublet - triplet masses , which is the split multiplet problem .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the split multiplet problem can be understood in 5d theories with the @xmath15 orbifold compactification@xcite .",
    "it is because of the geometric twist of the gauge group such that some fields are projected out from the massless spectrum .",
    "indeed , the orbifold compactification in string models@xcite has shown already some models without colored scalars , realizing the split multiplet .",
    "thus , orbifold compactification in higher dimensional theories may be the underlying reason for the split multiplet@xcite . in the context of this orbifold breaking of the gut groups ,",
    "some issues can be reconsidered as for the gauge coupling unification@xcite , the larger gut groups@xcite , and the flavor unification@xcite in this paper , we try to understand _ geometrically _ the top - bottom mass hierarchy and the @xmath6 puzzle@xcite .",
    "the fifth dimensional coordinate @xmath16 is compactified to a torus @xmath17 . furthermore",
    ", the point @xmath18 is identified to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 symmetry ) and the point @xmath21 is identified to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 symmetry ) .",
    "this modding introduces a fundamental region @xmath24 $ ] and there arise two fixed points , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this geometry is used to twist the gut multiplet . in particular the gut multiplet @xmath11 living in the bulk is twisted , the twisting being represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the twisting breaks @xmath0 .",
    "but in the bulk the @xmath0 symmetry is manifest above the unification scale and the gauge coupling unification is assumed above @xmath7 .",
    "the bulk fields are split into four different kaluza - klein(kk ) categories @xmath29 with the @xmath2 quantum numbers @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the 4d spacetime coordinate , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the massless field is @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in this way , the massless 4d higgs doublet is obtainable from 5d while color triplets are all heavy .",
    "now let us extend the study to include @xmath41 supersymmetry . in 5d",
    ", there exists an @xmath42 supersymmetry .",
    "one @xmath20 breaks down the @xmath42 down to @xmath41 and the other @xmath20 breaks @xmath8 down to the sm .",
    "two 4d spinors(e.g . two weyl spinors ) make up one 5d spinor .",
    "thus , a 5d field thery is not anomalous .",
    "we can introduce only one @xmath0 fermion multiplet in the bulk without worrying about the anomaly , say a hypermultiplet @xmath43 .",
    "upon compactification , the @xmath41 supermultiplets are @xmath44,\\ { \\rm mass}=2n / r\\\\ & h&_t^{(2n+1)}[(+-);(3,1,\\frac{1}{3})],\\ { \\rm mass}=(2n+1)/r\\\\ & \\hat h&_t^{(2n+1)}[(-+);(\\bar 3,1,-\\frac{1}{3})],\\ { \\rm mass}=(2n+1)/r\\\\ & \\hat h&_d^{(2n+2)}[(--);(1,2,\\frac{1}{2})],\\ { \\rm mass}=(2n+2)/r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets [ ] contain the quantum numbers of @xmath45 .",
    "the original 5d @xmath0 theory with one anti - quintet is anomaly free .",
    "but the orbifolding introduces one massless fermion doublet only , @xmath46 . the other massive fields in the bulk pair up to form massive kk towers of mass @xmath47 where @xmath48 . since the low energy theory should be anomaly free , we are dictated to introduce brane fermions .",
    "so at one fixed point we introduce a 4d @xmath41 sm higgs supermultiplet @xmath5 with the quantum number @xmath49 under @xmath9 . at this field theory level",

    "iii , we try to understand the @xmath6 puzzle geometrically along the line of the split multiplet in the bulk , and present model ( iii ) for an explicit presentation .    since there appears the kk tower of the split multiplet in the bulk we expect a correction to @xmath53 from the usual susy gut prediction , @xmath54 which is @xmath55@xcite .",
    "the superscript 0 denotes no threshold correction .",
    "we will show that in models ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) the kaluza - klein mode corrections are in the favorable direction toward the experimental data .",
    "at the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) level , @xmath4(coupling to @xmath56 quark ) and @xmath5(coupling to @xmath57 quark ) are not distinguished except for their gauge quantum numbers .",
    "thus , the apparent disparity of the top bottom masses is not understood .",
    "it is fixed either by a large top yukawa coupling and a small bottom coupling with @xmath58 or by comparable yukawa couplings and a large @xmath59 . in this section ,",
    "we explore a possibility that the couplings and vacuum expectation values are comparable , but the mass hierarchy is understood from a geometric origin@xcite .",
    "namely , the origin of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are different in a higher dimensional theory . and @xmath5 in the bulk and brane was considered before@xcite . however , in our gut theory , assigning @xmath5 at a brane is needed to explain the difference of @xmath60 mass scales in the low energy effective theory . ]    to concentrate on the @xmath60 disparity , we restrict our discussion to the third family only .",
    "as the simplest model of the field theoretic orbifold compactification , let us introduce a @xmath11 in the 5d bulk .",
    "the compactification is @xmath15 as shown in introduction . because of the unification in the 5d bulk the gauge coupling is unified above the gut scale @xmath7 which can be a string scale in a theory from string compactification .",

    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , we obtain a relation between couplings at the electroweak scale @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "strong coupling unification considered in ref.@xcite is due to the duplication of matter fields appearing in the extension of chiral multiplets to hypermultiplets which make the gauge coupling be strong at high energy scales .",

    ", one can determine the unification mass and gauge coupling constant @xmath102 at the unification scale .",

    ", the onset of the kk modes introduces another parameter @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we can satisfy the condition ( [ unify ] ) by appropriately choosing @xmath78 .",

    "we choose the condition as the ratio @xmath107 in view of the experimental errors including the error in @xmath108 and other effects ( running effects due to yukawa couplings and two loop runnings ) .",
    "thus , the unification condition ( [ unify ] ) is satisfied approximately but not exactly due to the error bars allowed and hence we will study just the modification of @xmath108 .",
    "then , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the kk mode corrected value in @xcite with reasonable choices of the ratio @xmath107 . for @xmath111 ,",

    ". in all cases considered above the additional logarithmic running reduces the discrepancy between experimental value and the prediction of susy gut even with no threshold correction .",
    "the coupling at the unification scale becomes @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "we used the conventional value @xmath117 at @xmath118 . at @xmath7",
    "we also cutoff the power running and there appears an o(1 ) uncertainty in @xmath119 , which however does not affect the unification condition .",
    "0.5 cm    * model ( ii ) : * we can repeat the same calculation for model ( ii ) .",
    "but note that the additional fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 have the following kk modes @xmath122 so that the zero modes are @xmath123 which mimicks a gut multiplet .",
    "another massive gut - like multiplets are the even kk modes @xmath124 and @xmath125 which contribute to the log running .",
    "the odd kk modes contributes only to the power running .",
    "thus , the difference of gauge couplings and the ratio @xmath119 are not changed , viz .",
    "eq.([unify ] ) . for @xmath126 the unification coupling",
    "is changed to @xmath127 for the exact unification .",
    "a similar analysis as in the study of model ( i ) for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the coupling constant at the unification scale becomes @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the kk mode correction to @xmath132 is the same as in model ( i ) .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , there are a lot of possibilities for obtaining hierarchies of couplings by locating some fields in the bulk and some fields at a brane . in this section ,",
    "we explore one more possibility for geometrically generating hierarchical coupling structure .",
    "one of the puzzles in the @xmath0 gut is that in the second family the quark yukawa coupling is too small ( by a factor of 3 ) compared to the lepton coupling , which is the @xmath6 puzzle . to obtain a desired suppression for the @xmath133 quark coupling , georgi and jarlskog introduced @xmath134 in addition to the usual @xmath135@xcite . in our scenario of keeping a split part of an @xmath0 multiplet as a massless spectrum in the bulk",
    ", there is a possibility of geometrically understanding the @xmath6 puzzle .    for simplicity , we modify the simplest example , model ( i ) of the previous section , and comment on another possibility after the discussion on model ( iii ) .",
    "the higgs fields , the first and the third family members are the same as in model ( i ) .",
    "we only change the members of the second family .",
    "* model ( iii ) *    among the second family members , some fields are put in the bulk . it is a split multiplet from @xmath136 . in the bulk , the members of @xmath137 $ ] under @xmath138 are assigned the @xmath2 parity as @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "thus , only the quark doublet @xmath141 has a zero mode spectrum @xmath142 which we interpret as the second family quark doublet . at low energy ,",
    "the theory must be anomaly - free and hence we locate the rest members of the second family , @xmath143 , at the brane , which is shown in fig .",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath156 therefore , @xmath157    model ( iii ) is interesting since it turns out that @xmath158 is very large @xmath159 and @xmath7 is the usual unification scale @xmath160  gev in order to satisfy the eq .",
    "( [ unify ] ) .",
    "the unification coupling constant is also close to the sgut value @xmath161 . due to the large @xmath162 compared to the other models , model ( iii ) allows the perfect unification with the logarithmic running between a small scale difference of @xmath163 .",
    "if we consider model ( iii ) with the backbone of model ( ii ) instead the backbone of model ( i ) , we obtain a better relation between the top - bottom mass hierarchy since the suppression will be linear in @xmath164 . assuming all the couplings to be order 1",
    ", we obtain @xmath165 at the unification scale , implying @xmath166 .",
    "@xmath132 is the same as in model ( iii ) .",
    "in this paper , we studied a new possibility for a field theoretic orbifold compactification possessing supersymmetry , which was applied to the top - bottom mass hierarchy and the @xmath6 puzzle .",
    "this possibility relies on the missing massless spectrum in the bulk .",
    "the 5d bulk theory with any fermion representation is anomaly free , but the orbifold compactification may project out split multiplet in the bulk .",
    "this situation has been observed in orbifold compactifications in string models@xcite . because of the split multiplet , the anomaly - free condition dictates to put some massless fermions at the brane so that the resulting 4d theory is anomaly free . in string examples , the field content and assignment of the fields at the fixed points",
    "are determined uniquely by the modular invariance requirement .",
    "but in our field theoretic example , the field content and the location are arbitrary . in this paper , we chose the simplest possibility .    in our examples , we put the @xmath43(containing the @xmath4 higgs doublet ) in the bulk .",
    "because of the twisting , only @xmath4 from the @xmath11 remains massless in the bulk .",
    "thus , the needed @xmath5 is put at a brane where the sm fields are located .",
    "thus , the bottom and the top quarks have geometrically different factors for the effective 4d yukawa couplings , rendering a top - bottom mass hierarchy .",
    "to enhance the hierarchical factor some sm fermions are put in the bulk in our second example .",
    "similarly , the @xmath6 puzzle is understood geometrically by putting the strange quark doublet in the bulk , thus reducing the strange quark yukawa coupling compared to the muon yukawa coupling .",
    "there are other applications along this line , e.g. reducing the up quark mass compared to the down quark mass . in all these examples we considered ,",
    "the corrections to the strong coupling constant are in the right direction , making the low energy effective mssm predictions closer to the experimental value .",
    "one tempting question to ask in this scenario might be the @xmath84 problem@xcite .",
    "certainly , one can not write @xmath167 in the bulk .",
    "it can be written only at the brane a. but the need to introduce @xmath5 at a is below the compactification scale @xmath77 . therefore ,",
    "writing the dimensional parameter such as @xmath84 must have a suppression factor , certainly less than @xmath78 .",
    "but at this moment , we do not understand geometrically how large the suppression factor is .",
    "we may need an additional discrete or global symmetry to sufficiently suppress @xmath84 . in any case , these extra symmetries are needed for proton longevity .",
    "the field theoretic orbifolding considered recently is very simple compared to the string theory orbifolding .",
    "however , it seems to be arbitrary in choosing and assigning the fields , and we expect that some string compactification in the future may lead to the above types of field theoretic orbifolding so that the assignment of the @xmath5 and the sm fields at the brane is no longer arbitrary .",
    "0.5 cm    * note added : * recently , there appeared an argument@xcite that it would not be possible to have a consistent susy field theory on the @xmath168 orbifold with a single bulk higgs multiplet , since there are gauge anomalies localized at the orbifold fixed points@xcite . in our case , however , the local gauge anomalies can be cancelled by introducing a brane higgs field and 5d chern - simons terms in the bulk@xcite .",
    "the models considered in the present paper are consistent up to introducing the chern - simons terms .",
