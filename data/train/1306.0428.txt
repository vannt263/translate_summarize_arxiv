    "let @xmath0 be a set of _ agents _ that must share a _ reward _ @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in settings where the share of @xmath2 that an agent receives depends on evaluations that its peers make concerning the agent s contribution to the group .",
    "hence , each agent @xmath3 is asked to provide _ evaluations _ for all peers .",
    "such evaluations can be either _",
    "direct evaluations _ or _ predictions _ of absolute frequencies of received evaluations . for avoiding a biased self - evaluation , an agent is not requested to provide evaluations for itself .    given a positive integer parameter @xmath4 ,",
    "the direct evaluations made by an agent @xmath5 are formally represented by the vector @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents agent @xmath8 s evaluation given to agent @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath11 represents the top possible evaluation that an agent can receive and an explicit constraint that bounds the sum of direct evaluations .",
    "the predictions made by agent @xmath8 are formally represented by the vector @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the agent @xmath8 s prediction for the absolute frequency of evaluations given to agent @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the evaluations are submitted to a central entity called _ mechanism _ , which is responsible for sharing the reward .",
    "this entity relies only on reported evaluations when determining agents shares .",
    "we assume that evaluations are independent across agents , that evaluations provided by an agent for its peers are independent among themselves , and that agents act to maximize their expected shares .",
    "this implies that agents may deliberately lie when providing evaluations for others .",
    "therefore , we distinguish between the true evaluations made by agent @xmath8 , @xmath17 for direct evaluations and @xmath18 for predictions , and the evaluations that it reports to the mechanism , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "we overload the notation using @xmath22 to denote both direct evaluations and predictions , but we make clear its meaning when necessary .",
    "we call @xmath22 the _ strategy _ of agent @xmath8 and @xmath23 a _",
    "strategy profile_. we define @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we can represent a strategy profile as @xmath26 . if the reported evaluation of agent @xmath8 is equal to its true evaluation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 for direct evaluations or @xmath28 for predictions , then we say that agent @xmath8 s strategy is _ truthful _ , and represent it by @xmath29 .",
    "we say that @xmath30 is _ collectively truthful _ if all reported strategies are truthful .",
    "we denote the share of @xmath2 given to agent @xmath8 when all the reported evaluations are @xmath30 by @xmath31 . the most important property",
    "we wish our mechanisms to have is that the share assigned to each agent should reflect the reported evaluations for that agent .",
    "in addition to this requirement , we would like our mechanisms to be _ budget - balanced _",
    ", _ individually rational _ , _ incentive - compatible _ ( or _ strategy - proof _ ) , and _ collusion - resistant _ @xcite .",
    "we consider that a _ collusion _ between agents @xmath8 and @xmath9 occurs when agent @xmath8 changes its truthful evaluation for agent @xmath9 , resulting in the report @xmath32 , and , for doing this , it receives a side - payment , @xmath33 , so that :    1 .",

    "collusions with more than two agents can be decomposed into a union of collusions between two agents ( a liar and a beneficiary ) .",
    "we say that a mechanism is _ collusion - resistant _ when , for all agents @xmath36 and strategies @xmath32 , where @xmath37 for direct evaluations and @xmath38 for predictions , we have @xmath39 \\leq \\mathbb{e } \\left [ \\gamma_i(\\accentset{*}{\\textbf{x}}_i,\\textbf{x}_{-i } ) + \\gamma_j(\\accentset{*}{\\textbf{x}}_i,\\textbf{x}_{-i } ) \\right]$ ] . to provide incentives for truth - telling , we use the following strictly proper scoring rule @xcite :    @xmath40\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is a probability distribution and @xmath42 is the observed event among @xmath43 possible outcomes .",
    "the peer - evaluation mechanism announces the parameter @xmath11 and requests agents to submit direct evaluations .",
    "the sharing scheme is presented in algorithm 1 . the share received by each agent @xmath5",
    "is computed by aggregating its received evaluations into a variable @xmath44 , and multiplying it by a normalizing factor @xmath45 . due to the constraint imposed on direct evaluations , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 , it is clear that after this operation @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , the mechanism is budget - balanced . because the evaluations are greater than or equal to zero , an agent can not receive a negative share . then , the mechanism is individually rational .",
    "the following theorem states our main result concerning the properties of the peer - evaluation mechanism .",
    "the peer - evaluation mechanism is strategy - proof .",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49    the main drawback of the peer - evaluation mechanism is that agents do not have direct incentives for lying , but they also do not have incentives for telling the truth . this characteristic makes the mechanism extremely susceptible to collusions .",
    "the peer - prediction mechanism announces the parameter @xmath11 and requests agents to submit predictions .",
    "we can see this game as if each agent @xmath8 was answering the following question about each other agent @xmath9 : if agents were to evaluate agent @xmath9 , what would be the absolute frequency of the evaluations received by it ? .",
    "the sharing scheme is presented in algorithm 2 .",
    "the main idea of the peer - prediction mechanism is to compute agents shares using _ grades _ , which are aggregations of the expected evaluations calculated from predictions , and using _ scoring rules _ @xcite to generate",
    "_ scores _ and enforce truth - telling . for using scoring rules ,",
    "it is necessary to have a realityto score an assessment .",
    "our solution considers grades as observed events of an uncertain quantity , with possible outcomes inside the set @xmath50 , and scores the reported predictions as if they were assessments            the sharing process has essentially four steps .",
    "the first one transforms all the predictions about the evaluations for an agent @xmath5 to a positive real number , @xmath55 , by creating a probability distribution from each prediction @xmath56 , and summing the expected value of each distribution .    in the second step ,",
    "the score of each agent @xmath5 is calculated as follows : first , for each agent @xmath57 , a probability distribution is created from the prediction @xmath58 .",
    "second , a temporary grade for agent @xmath9 is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the expected evaluations received by it , without taking into consideration the expected value from agent @xmath8 s prediction .",
    "the function @xmath59 ( nearest integer function ) rounds this temporary grade to an integer number inside the set @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the mechanism applies the strictly proper scoring rule represented by equation 1 on the probability distribution ( assessment ) and the temporary grade ( observed event ) . in the end , the score of agent @xmath8 is the arithmetic mean of results provided by the scoring rule for each prediction submitted by agent @xmath8 .    in the third step ,",
    "agents grades are computed as the arithmetic mean of the expected evaluations received by them . finally , they have their shares computed in the last step .",
    "agents scores are multiplied by a constant @xmath61 and added to their grades .",
    "the result is then multiplied by a weight @xmath62 to form agents shares .",
    "the constant @xmath63 fine - tunes the weight given to scores .",
    "because the highest grade that an agent can receive is equal to @xmath11 , and the highest score is equal to @xmath64 , using the weight @xmath65 guarantees that the mechanism will not make a loss in the case of every agent receives the highest grade and score .",
    "an obvious consequence of such approach is that when at least one agent does not receive the highest grade or score , then the mechanism will make a profit .",
    "this implies that it is not always budget - balanced .",
    "given that scores and grades are always greater than or equal to zero , the mechanism is individually rational .",
    "the following theorem states our main result related to the peer - prediction mechanism ."
