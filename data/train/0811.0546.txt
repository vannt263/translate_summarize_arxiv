    "molecular reaction dynamics studies aim at understanding chemical reactions and inelastic collisions at the atomic scale . in other words ,",
    "this field of research draws much of the conceptual framework in which chemical reactivity , in a broad sense , can be thought @xcite .    quantum state - resolved integral and differential cross sections ( icss and dcss ) , measured in supersonic molecular beam experiments , are among the most fundamental observables of molecular reaction dynamics .",
    "this paper deals with their classical mechanical description in a semi - classical spirit .",
    "most processes considered up to now involve three or four atoms , on purpose .",
    "this allows both measurements at an amazing level of detail and accurate theoretical descriptions of the observables from first principles .",
    "additionally , planetary atmospheres and interstellar clouds are mainly made of small species which dynamics should be understood .    nowadays , however , much of molecular science is polarized on larger systems , like nano - objects or molecules of biological interest , and the natural trend in molecular reaction dynamics is also to move towards increasing complexity .",
    "more and more polyatomic processes are thus under scrutiny .",
    "state - of - the - art descriptions of state - resolved icss and dcss are in principle performed within the framework of exact quantum scattering approaches ( eqs ) @xcite . however , despite the impressive progress of computer performance achieved in the last decades , these approaches can hardly be applied to larger than three or four - atom systems as the basis sizes necessary for converging the calculations turn prohibitive .",
    "a popular alternative is the quasi - classical trajectory method ( qctm ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is intuitive , relatively easy to implement , much less time consuming than eqs approaches and therefore , quite appealing for studying polyatomic processes .",
    "the price to pay is obviously a loss in accuracy as compared to eqs approaches .",
    "nevertheless , significant advances have been made in the last few years through the replacement of the standard binning ( sb ) procedure by the gaussian weighting ( gw ) one @xcite . in the sb method , each trajectory has the same statistical weight . on the other hand ,",
    "the gw procedure consists in weighting each trajectory by a gaussian - like coefficient such that the closer the final actions to integer values , the larger the coefficient .",
    "this procedure proves to be especially efficient when few vibrational levels are available in the final products .",
    "though initially proposed on the basis of rather intuitive arguments , the gw procedure can be shown to find its roots in classical @xmath0 matrix theory , the former semi - classical approach of molecular collisions pioneered by miller and marcus in the early seventies @xcite .",
    "central quantities of chemical reaction theory are ( 1 ) the state - to - state reaction probabilities @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are reagent and product quantum states , ( 2 ) the densities @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the scattering angle or any given angle of the problem and ( 3 ) the capture probabilities @xmath6 for processes involving long - lived intermediate complexes @xcite . from these quantities , any state - resolved ics and dcs can be determined .    to calculate the previous probabilities ( or density of ) , one must generate classical dynamical conditions corresponding to quantum state @xmath2 .",
    "such a generation is readily performed in angle - action coordinates @xcite as these are in close correspondence with quantum numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "angle - action variables should not be used to run trajectories as contrary to cartesian coordinates , they lead to strong numerical instabilities . the transformation from angle - action variables to cartesian",
    "coordinates is therefore a crucial step of qctm .    for atom - diatom ( semi ) collisions , this transformation can be found in the book by whittaker @xcite and in a paper by miller @xcite .",
    "however , we have not been able to find in the literature the analogous transformation for a generic type of collision .",
    "the goal of the paper is to thus to derive it .",
    "in this work , a prototype system is presented , namely a five - atom molecule made of a triatomic ( abc ) and a diatomic ( de ) .",
    "the former can be used as a model for a non - linear polyatomic fragment while the latter constitutes a simpler case very commonly found in practice . the transformation provided here",
    "will therefore be relevant for a generic pair of molecular fragments , _",
    "e.g. _ diatom + diatom , asymmetric top + diatom , asymmetric top + asymmetric top , etc  after straightforward generalizations .",
    "these , along with the transformations in @xcite allow thus to treat any case of interest .",
    "we suppose the fragments are to be studied in the low energy regime where only the lowest vibrational states can be populated , thus the harmonic description of their vibrations is a reasonably accurate approximation .",
    "anharmonic corrections can be introduced when necessary .    throughout this work ,",
    "the usual convention of boldfacing vector magnitudes is used .",
    "cartesian frames centered on a generic point p are represented as @xmath7 .",
    "a given vector @xmath8 in such a frame will be rewritten as @xmath9 if we refer it to @xmath10 instead .",
    "calligraphic letters are used for representing matrices and second - rank tensors .",
    "some standard transformations , _",
    "e.g. _ that of normal modes to cartesian coordinates , are included for completeness .",
    "finally , the two fragments , abc and de , are numbered 1 and 2 and so are their associated magnitudes .      the system is schematically represented in fig .",
