    "noisy channel coding theorems developed in the last fifteen years  @xcite are a central topic in quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "they provide quantifiers for the effects of noise in quantum communication and allow to investigate how it is possible to reliably communicate through quantum channels .",
    "these are mathematically described in the quantum operation @xmath0  @xcite formalism : an input state described by the density matrix @xmath1 yields an output state @xmath2 , where the quantum channel @xmath3 is a linear map .",
    "effects of noise are described by a non - unitary @xmath4 .",
    "+ such picture can be applied to a variety of situations , for instance to information storage into a _ quantum memory _",
    "@xcite or to state transfer from one unit to an other of a quantum computer  @xcite ; it may describe photons traveling across a fiber  @xcite in a quantum cryptographic system or entanglement distribution between different parties  @xcite . +",
    "a central question is : how is it possible to overcome the information degradation due to noise , in order to obtain a reliable transmission ? as in the classical realm , in order to protect communication one may add some redundancy to the information encoding at the channel input  @xcite . on the other hand redundancy",
    "lowers the channel efficiency in terms of information transmitted per channel use .",
    "so the former question becomes : `` what is the maximum rate of classical or quantum information that can be faithfully transmitted ? '' .",
    "classical and quantum capacities  @xcite , defined as the maximum number of bits / qubits that can be reliably transmitted per channel use ( in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of channel uses ) , provide the answer to this question . + from the physical side , carriers for quantum or classical information are quantum systems .",
    "noise in communication is due to the unavoidable interaction of such quantum systems with their environment .",
    "since typically a quantum channel has to be used many times , this physical perspective makes clear that the backaction of the environment may play a crucial role in the determination of the maximal rate of faithful information transfer .",
    "the simplest models for quantum channels are memoryless , that is to say , at each channel use the environment backaction is negligible and the system undertakes the same transformation @xmath5 . if we use the channel @xmath6 times we have that @xmath7 where @xmath8 . on the other hand real systems exhibit correlations among subsequent uses .",
    "for example this can happen when environment correlation times are longer than the time between consecutive uses .",
    "these kind of channel are called _ memory channel _ and for these we have @xmath9 .",
    "+ starting from the seminal work  @xcite , quantum channels with memory have attracted increasing attention in the last years , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "coding theorems have been proved for classes of quantum memory channels  @xcite .",
    "the presence of memory can bring interesting features : memory can enhance the quantum capacity of a channel  @xcite , and ensemble of entangled states can improve the memory channel aptitude to transmit classical information  @xcite .",
    "+ early models of correlated uses considered markov chains to model memory effects  @xcite : on one hand this gave a powerful tool to begin to understand how memory effects may change the transmission property of a given channel , on the other hand often real systems exhibit a dynamics which is not captured by simple markov chains .",
    "for instance solid state systems , which are very promising for quantum information purposes thanks to their potential integrability , scalability and controllability , are subject to a variety of noise sources producing low - frequency noise , often exhibiting a typical @xmath10 spectrum  @xcite",
    ". a realistic description of such systems may require the hamiltonian modeling of the sources of noise with memory , and in general studying selected hamiltonian models provides basic insight to understand memory effects of real system used as quantum channels .",
    "+ in this work we consider a hamiltonian model implementing a _ memory amplitude damping channel _ , and study exactly the behavior for two - channel uses .",
    "the amplitude damping channel  @xcite models for instance environment - induced relaxation processes from the excited state to the ground state of a quantum two - level system .",
    "it provides an adequate description of systems where relaxation is dominant with respect to pure dephasing processes .",
    "+ the hamiltonian model we choose describes qubit ( information carriers ) sequentially interacting with a damped harmonic mode .",
    "the interaction is of the jaynes - cummings type , therefore the whole system can be visualized by a qubit - micromaser  @xcite system , the qubit train being a stream of two - level rydberg atoms injected at some rate into the cavity .",
    "this model is fundamental in quantum optics , where it describes cavity  @xcite quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) systems , where quantum two level systems are strongly coupled to discrete photon modes in high - quality cavities ; recently circuit  @xcite qed systems operating in the microwave range have been implemented on a solid - state platform and similar architectures have been proposed for the implementation of hybrid quantum memories  @xcite .",
    "a single use yields an an amplitude damping channel  @xcite @xmath5 , provided the cavity is prepared in its ground state .",
    "memory effects naturally arise when repeated uses are considered due the fact that the cavity changes its state after interacting with each information carrier .",
    "the strength of memory depends on the cavity quality factor : the greater it is , the stronger are memory effects .",
    "+ in a previous work we have shown that in the limit of strong dephasing this environment , although decreasing the information transfer per use ( the coherent information @xmath11 , see sec .",
    "ii ) , in a regime where memory effects are present still yields a rate of information transfer larger than operating with a low qubit injection rate to allow memory to decay . in this paper",
    "we analyze the channel aptitude to transmit quantum and classical information by considering exactly two uses of this channel .",
    "we show that the channel is _ forgetful _",
    "@xcite , and therefore usual quantifiers for quantum communication satisfy noisy coding theorems  @xcite",
    ". a careful study of the above quantities allows to conclude that memory effects improve the channel aptitude to transmit both quantum information , i.e. they may determine a larger @xmath11 per use than in the absence of memory .",
    "an analogous statement also holds for transmission of classical information .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall the concepts of quantum and classical capacities which apply to memoryless channels and for the class of forgetful memory channels  @xcite . in section",
    "iii we present our channel model and demonstrate its forgetfulness . in section",
    "iv we discuss the memoryless limit , whereas in section v we present numerical results for two channel uses , characterizing the channel behavior by suitable entropic quantities ; we also investigate the mechanism by which memory changes the channel aptitude to transmit classical and quantum information . finally in section",
    "vi we discuss the significance of our results , pointing out the key role of qubit - environment entanglement in increasing correlations between successive uses .",
    "we consider a quantum information carrier , which is a quantum system @xmath12 whose state is chosen from the ensemble @xmath13 ( @xmath14 belongs to the hilbert space @xmath15 of the system ) , with a priori probabilities @xmath16 .",
    "this quantum source is then described by the density operator  @xcite @xmath17 due to the unavoidable coupling to uncontrollable degrees of freedom , the transmission of this information is in general noisy .",
    "indeed any quantum system interacts with its environment , thus deviating from the expected evolution .",
    "therefore one has to deal with a larger system @xmath18 , whose hamiltonian is @xmath19 , and describes the system ( @xmath20 ) , the environment ( @xmath21 ) and their mutual interaction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the reduced evolution of @xmath12 is obtained as a linear , completely positive , trace preserving ( cpt ) map  @xcite @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the initial state of the environment , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the hamiltonian of @xmath18 in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the map @xmath0 is the quantum channel , accounting for the noisy processes that the information carrier undergoes during transmission . in what follows we consider @xmath6 channel uses .",
    "the quantum source is still described by ( [ eq : q - source - density - operator ] ) , where now @xmath27 , and the @xmath6 uses map is denoted by @xmath28 .    in this paper",
    "we are interested to the quantum capacity @xmath29 and the classical capacity @xmath30 .",
    "the former quantifies the faithful transmission of quantum information , measured by the dimension of the largest subspace of the @xmath6-use input hilbert space @xmath31 that can be reliably transmitted down the channel , in the limit of large @xmath6 .",
    "the classical capacity @xmath30 gives the maximum amount of classical information that can be reliably transmitted per channel use .",

    "the quantity @xmath46 is called _ coherent information _  @xcite and must be maximized over over all input states @xmath47 .    the regularization @xmath48 is necessary since in general @xmath49 fails to be subadditive  @xcite and therefore it can not be excluded that @xmath50 .",
    "the regularization is not necessary if the final state of the environment can be reconstructed from the final state of the system . in this case , referred to as _ degradable channels _",
    "@xcite , the coherent information reduces to a suitable conditional entropy , which is subadditive , and the quantum capacity is given by the `` single - letter '' formula @xmath51 .",
    "it is worth noticing that for degradable channels the private classical capacity @xmath52 , defined as the capacity for transmitting classical information protected against an eavesdropper  @xcite , is equal to the quantum capacity @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the reliability of transmission of a subspace @xmath53 through a channel described by the cpt map @xmath3 can be measured by the minimum pure - state fidelity  @xcite @xmath54 following  @xcite we say that the rate ( per channel use ) @xmath55 of transmission of subspace dimensions is achievable with channel @xmath34 if there exists a sequence of subspaces @xmath56 of @xmath31 such that @xmath57 and there are coding and decoding cpt maps , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 ( for the sake of simplicity , we assume that @xmath61 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 all act on the same hilbert space @xmath31 ) .",

    "note that for the reliable transmission of classical information the system is not required to preserve relative phases of superpositions of different messages .",
    "therefore , condition ( [ psfcondifion ] ) must be fulfilled not for all states in subspace @xmath56 but just for a orthonormal basis of that subspace .",
    "classical capacity is then obtained as the supremum of achievable rates ( per channel use ) of transmission of classical information .",
    "when memory effects are taken into account , @xmath75 , i.e. , the channel does not act on each carrier independently . in this case",
    "the regularized coherent and holevo information in general only provide upper bounds on the channel capacities . however , for the class of _ forgetful channels _",
    "@xcite , for which memory effects decay exponentially with time , a quantum coding theorem showing that this bounds can be saturated exists  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to express forgetfulness in an operational way , pointing out the feature that allows the mapping of a forgetful channel into a memoryless one , with negligible error .",
    "the key point is the use of a double - blocking strategy .",

    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we consider blocks of @xmath76 uses of the channel and do the actual coding and decoding for the first @xmath6 uses , ignoring the remaining @xmath77 idle uses .",

    "the corresponding cpt map @xmath80 can be approximated , with arbitrarily small error , by the memoryless setting @xmath81 if  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the trace norm  @xcite , @xmath1 is any @xmath84 input state , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are real parameters , that are independent of the input state @xmath1 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . expression ( [ eq : forgetful ] ) states that , even though the error committed by replacing the memory channel itself with the corresponding memoryless channel grows with the number of blocks @xmath79 , it goes to zero exponentially fast with the number @xmath77 of idle uses in a single block .",
    "this key feature of forgetful channels allows the proof of coding theorems for this class of quantum memory channels , by mapping them into the corresponding memoryless channels , for which quantum coding theorems hold  @xcite . in the following",

    "due to the contractivity of trace - preserving quantum operations  @xcite , this latter quantity is upper bounded by @xmath105 which in its turn is upper bounded by @xmath106 for a forgetful channel ( [ eq : forgetful ] ) . then , quantity ( [ psfcondition3 ] ) is upper bounded by the sum of the left part of ( [ psfcondition4 ] ) and by @xmath106 : @xmath107 as it is stressed in ref .",

    ". nevertheless , thanks to exponential dependence on the idle uses @xmath77 , both terms can be simultaneously made arbitrarily small , for @xmath79 large enough .",

    "we shall see that the mechanism which permits to overcome the memoryless setting is based on the correlations created between the two systems involved in the communication .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate the key role played by the entanglement between the local environment and the information carriers .",
    "let us first look at quantum information transmission .",
    "in the previous section we observed that ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coherentinformation ] ) : @xmath272 this relation approaches equality for long times @xmath137 ( with respect to @xmath136 ) , i.e. for low values of the memory parameter @xmath245 . on the other hand , the difference @xmath273 is larger for shorter times @xmath137 , i.e. for higher values of @xmath245 .",
    "numerically , it turns out that the increasing of @xmath49 is mainly due to the decreasing of the entropy exchange , since the output entropy depends very slightly on memory .    at first glance , it would be tempting to say that the local environment entangles with the first qubit and therefore its capability to disturb the second qubit is reduced . however , this is not the case . to understand this point",
    "we carry out a numerical analysis , in which we consider the entropic quantities related to each single use , and compare them with the corresponding two - uses quantities .",
    "we refer to @xmath274 ( @xmath275 , @xmath276 ) as the coherent information ( entropy exchange , output entropy ) related to @xmath277-th use ( @xmath278 ) , obtained tracing out the degrees of freedom relative to the other channel use .",
    "we observe ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : memoryeffects ] ) that the coherent information for the second channel use @xmath279 is smaller than the memoryless value @xmath280 : memory worsens the performances of the second channel use . for the first use by definition @xmath281 ( and @xmath282 ) .",
    "so one has : @xmath283 and because memory only slightly affects @xmath284 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : memoryeffects ] , above , inset ) , inequality ( [ eq : in_coh_1 ] ) is mainly due to : @xmath285 that is , _ if we independently consider the two channel outputs , then the two uses are more noisy than in the memoryless case_.    by studying the entropy exchange behavior , we can point out in which way memory improves the channel aptitude to transmit quantum information . from fig .",
    "[ fig : memoryeffects ] we have that : @xmath286 it follows that correlations between systems @xmath287 and @xmath288 satisfy : @xmath289 ( the last equality simply follows from the definitions @xmath290 and @xmath291 ) .",
    "these correlations vanish for the memoryless setting , since by construction systems @xmath292 and @xmath293 are initially uncorrelated .",
    "therefore memory effects establish correlations between @xmath287 and @xmath288 ; moreover such correlations grow with the degree of memory @xmath245 .",
    "we would like to stress the key role of entanglement between the cavity and the qubits in establishing these correlations . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the action of an additional source of noise completely dephasing the local environment before the second channel use  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "any entanglement between the cavity and the first qubit is destroyed .",
    "the coherent information per channel use @xmath294 decreases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : memoryeffects ] , above ) and the inequality ( [ eq : memoryeffects-2 ] ) is no longer fulfilled : the advantages produced by memory are lost . returning to the entropy exchange behavior we find that @xmath295 approaches @xmath296 so that correlations ( [ eq : correlations ] ) are considerably reduced .",
    "we can conclude that the creation of correlations between @xmath287 and @xmath288 , mediated by qubit entanglement with the common local environment , is the essential mechanism allowing us to overcome the memoryless quantum capacity .",
    "let us look at the classical information transmission .",
    "we recall the holevo information expression for a given source @xmath297 : @xmath298 where @xmath299 and @xmath300 is the output entropy averaged over all codewords .",
    "we refer to @xmath301 ( @xmath302 , @xmath303 ) as the holevo quantity ( average output entropy , output entropy ) related to the @xmath277-th use . differently from",
    "what we have observed for the coherent information , the holevo quantity related to the second use is not worsened by memory .",
    "but the two uses increasing of holevo information can not be ascribed to the @xmath304 behavior . indeed from fig .",
    "[ fig : memoryeffects - classicalcap ] ( above ) , it appears that : @xmath305 as we can see from the same figure ( inset ) the range of variation of the output entropies @xmath306 and @xmath303 , is much smaller than the one relative to the holevo quantity , so that the inequality ( [ eq : memory - chi - ineq ] ) is mainly due to @xmath307 we stress that the average output entropy play a role analogous to the entropy exchange in the quantum information transmission scenario : it quantifies the amount of noise introduced by the channel .",
    "we can conclude that also from the point of view of classical information transmission , _ the channel introduces more noise if we independently consider the two channel outputs .",
    "_ inequality ( [ eq : memory - avsout - ineq ] ) means that , if we send a codeword @xmath308 down the channel , then the channel establishes correlations between the output states of the two qubits .",
    "also in this case , these correlations are mediated by the local environment : if we completely dephase the cavity after it interacts with the first qubit , we lose any advantage , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : memoryeffects - classicalcap ] .",
    "we would like to comment on the significance of our results obtained with two channel uses .",
    "first of all , one could send a couple of qubits through the channel and reset the oscillator to its ground state after the transit of each couple . in this case",
    "our results are exact and show that for this new channel the quantum and classical capacities would be larger than in the memoryless case , where the reset is operated after each channel use",
    ". therefore , our results can be indicative of a trend , that further enhancements of the coherent and holevo information per channel use may be obtained by considering longer qubit trains .",
    "we can also view the question from a slightly different point of view .",
    "we start by considering the correlations between the two - qubit system @xmath309 and the reference system @xmath310 introduced to purify the initial input state ( indexes @xmath228 and @xmath311 refer to the first and the second channel use ) .",
    "such correlations are measured by the _ quantum mutual information _  @xcite @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath314 the joint entropy for the composite system @xmath42 .",
    "this situation describes the case in which alice is attempting to transmit two halves ( @xmath41 ) of two pairs of bell states to bob , while she retains the other halves ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "after the two channel uses correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath41 read as follows : @xmath315 where the prime symbols refer to the output states , @xmath316 is the output entropy and @xmath317 the entropy exchange . since @xmath318 is independent of the degree of memory @xmath245 ( i.e. , independent of the separation time @xmath137 ) ,",
    "we find that the fact that memory increases coherent information @xmath49 is deeply related to the fact that memory helps to preserve correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath41 .    with regard to the holevo information , a similar argument can be developed .",
    "indeed , we can model the mixed classical - quantum ensemble @xmath74 by means of an enlarged hilbert space representation  @xcite : @xmath319 where @xmath320 is and orthonormal basis for the hilbert space of the auxiliary system @xmath321 .",
    "the correlations between @xmath321 and @xmath41 read @xmath322 where @xmath323 is a conditional von neumann entropy . now",
    "if we choose an ensemble of pure states @xmath324 , the correlations between the systems @xmath321 and @xmath41 are maximum , and equal to @xmath325 , since @xmath326 .",
    "but when we transmit the quantum system @xmath41 down the channel , it adds noise such that @xmath327 , and in general @xmath328 .",
    "thus correlations between @xmath321 and @xmath41 decrease to : @xmath329 then the holevo information is just the correlation between the classical variable we want to transmit and the quantum system we have used to transmit it . since memory enhances the holevo quantity with respect to the memoryless setting , we conclude that memory helps to preserve these correlations",
    ".    in both scenarios - quantum and classical information transmission - memory helps in preserving the correlations between the systems involved in the transmission .",
    "we stress again the key role of entanglement between information carriers and the channel",

    "<S> we prove that this memory channel is forgetful , so that quantum coding theorems hold for its capacities . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze entropic quantities relative to two uses of this channel . </S>",
    "<S> we show that memory effects improve the channel aptitude to transmit both classical and quantum information , and we investigate the mechanism by which memory acts in changing the channel transmission properties . </S>"
