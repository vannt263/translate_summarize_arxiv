    "black holes are among the most fascinating and counterintuitive objects predicted by modern physical theory .",
    "their counterintuitive nature comes not from obtuse features of gravitation physics , but rather from the extreme limit of well - understood and well - observed features  the bending of light and the redshifting of clocks by gravity .",
    "this limit is inarguably strange , and drives us to predictions that may reasonably be considered bothersome . given the lack of direct observational or experimental data about gravity in the relevant regime , a certain skepticism about the black hole hypothesis is perhaps reasonable .",
    "indeed , one can understand eddington s somewhat plaintive cry `` i think there should be a law of nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way ! ''",
    "@xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is _ no _ such law of nature .",
    "we expect that in any object which is sufficiently massive , gravity can overwhelm all opposing forces , causing that object to collapse into a black hole  a region of spacetime in which gravity is so intense that not even light can escape .",
    "indeed , astronomical observations have now provided us with a large number of _ candidate _ black holes  dark objects which are so massive and compact that the hypothesis that they are the black holes of general relativity ( gr ) is quite plausible .",
    "these objects are now believed to be quite common  extremely massive black hole candidates ( several @xmath0 solar masses to @xmath1 solar masses ) reside in the cores of almost all galaxies , including our own ; stellar mass candidates ( several to several tens of solar masses ) are seen in orbit with stars in our galaxy ; and evidence suggests that `` intermediate '' mass black holes may fill the gap between these limits .",
    "not only is there no law preventing stars from `` behaving in this absurd way '' , nature appears to revel in such absurdities .",
    "it must be emphasized that , from the purely observational perspective , at present these objects are black hole _",
    "candidates_. we have not unequivocally established that _ any _ of these objects exhibits all of the properties that gr predicts for `` real '' black holes .",
    "gr is consistent with newton s theory of gravity in the appropriate limit .",
    "this means that , for example , orbits of black holes are totally consistent with newtonian gravity except for strong field ( small radius ) orbits . establishing whether these objects are the black holes of gr requires observations that probe close to the black hole itself .",
    "because black holes are so compact , this is a challenging proposition .",
    "consider the putative black hole at the core of our galaxy .",
    "if it is a black hole as described by gr , its radius should be about @xmath2 kilometers .",
    "it is located roughly 7500 parsecs from the earth .",
    "the black hole thus subtends an angle @xmath3 milliarcseconds on the sky !",
    "resolving such small scale phenomena is extraordinarily difficult .    given that no observations have unequivocally established that black hole candidates are gr s black holes , it is not surprising that alternate hypotheses have been advanced to describe these candidates .",
    "since gr is a classical theory and nature is fundamentally quantum , one might _",
    "expect _ something other than classical gr to describe black hole candidates .",
    "such a modification certainly seems necessary in order to , for example , resolve black hole information paradoxes @xcite .",
    "the standard view is that , though modifications to classical gr are needed , their impact is most likely negligible for astrophysical black holes .",
    "black holes describe gravitational effects far beyond what we normally encounter , and so appear to be `` extreme objects '' . within the context of general relativity ,",
    "however , they are not so extreme . in gr , the `` fundamental '' gravitational field",
    "is not manifested as acceleration ; instead , it is the _ spacetime curvature _ , which is manifested as tidal fields .",
    "though black holes have enormous gravitational acceleration , their tides can be quite gentle .",
    "in particular , astrophysical black hole tides are _ far _ smaller than the level at which one would expect quantum corrections to be important .",
    "regardless of whether one accepts this standard view of modifications to gr theory or whether one postulates more drastic modifications , one needs some kind of `` gold standard '' against which to compare observations .",
    "the view we take here is that , given the number of possible ways in which one can modify classical gr , it is currently most reasonable to treat the classical black hole solution as our gold standard . _",
    "if _ observations show that this is inadequate , then we would have an experimentally motivated direction to pursue modifications to general relativity and to black holes .",
    "the goal of these lectures is to summarize the case for black holes within classical gr .",
    "we first discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : schw ] , the simplest , exact black hole solutions of general relativity .",
    "we illustrate that they have a completely reasonable , non - singular nature ( at least in their exteriors ! ) , but that uncovering this nature can be a bit subtle owing to some pathologies in the coordinates that are commonly used to describe them . changing to coordinates which eliminate these pathologies ,",
    "we show that light can never escape once inside a certain radius ( the `` black '' ) , and thus any object which falls inside is doomed to fall until diverging tidal forces tear it apart ( the `` hole '' ) .",
    "the solution we use to build this description corresponds to a black hole that exists for all time .",
    "one might worry that the features we discovered using it are a contrivance of that artificial , eternal solution .",
    "can we really create a region of spacetime with these features beginning with well - behaved `` normal '' matter ? as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : collapse ] , we can . a well - known solution , developed by oppenheimer and his student snyder in 1939 @xcite shows _ analytically _ that pressureless , spherical matter quickly collapses from a smooth , well - behaved initial distribution to form a black hole with _ exactly _ the properties of the exact solution that we initially discussed .",
    "numerical calculations show that including pressure and eliminating spherical symmetry leads to the same result .",
    "these results depend on the solution having no angular momentum .",
    "roy kerr lifted this requirement when he discovered the solution which now bears his name @xcite .",
    "spinning black holes are the generic case that we expect astrophysically ; as discussed in secs . and [ sec : unique_stable ] classical general relativity predicts the kerr black hole to be the unique and stable endpoint of gravitational collapse .",
    "we discuss the perturbative techniques which were first used to advance this result , and discuss numerical calculations which show that it holds generically .",
    "the kerr black hole is thus the object which general relativity predicts describes the many black hole candidates which we observe today .",
    "what remains is to test this prediction . in sec .",
    ", we briefly describe some of the observations being developed today which can probe into the strong field of these objects and confront the kerr black hole hypothesis with data .    throughout this article",
    ", we assume that the reader has basic familiarity with general relativity ; in particular , the notion of geodesics and the einstein field equations will play an important role .",
    "carroll s slac summer institute lectures covered this material ; the reader is referred to those lectures for gr background .",
    "the presentation of carroll s textbook @xcite and the classic textbook by misner , thorne , and wheeler ( mtw ) @xcite influenced the development of these lectures quite a bit .",
    "readers interested in a very detailed discussion of black hole physics would be well - served with poisson s textbook @xcite .",
    "in most of the article , we use `` relativist s units '' in which @xmath4 .",
    "these units nicely highlight the fact that general relativity has no intrinsic scale ; as we shall see , all important lengthscales and timescales are set by and become proportional to black hole mass .",
    "we shall sometimes restore @xmath5s and @xmath6s to make certain quantities more readable .",
    "useful conversion factors for discussing astrophysical black holes come from expressing the solar mass ( @xmath7 ) in these units : @xmath8",
    "the simplest black hole solution is described by the _ schwarzschild metric _ , discovered by karl schwarzschild in 1916 @xcite . in what are now known as `` schwarzschild coordinates '' ,",
    "this metric takes the form @xmath9 by building the einstein tensor from this metric , it is a simple matter to show that the schwarzschild solution is an exact solution to the einstein field equations @xmath10 for @xmath11  i.e. , it s a vacuum solution .",
    "since it satisfies einstein s equations , we can be satisfied that this metric is mathematically consistent .",
    "is it however a physically meaningful solution ? is this metric one that we might use to describe real objects in the universe , or is it too idealized to be worthwhile ? to answer this , we first examine several limiting regimes of this spacetime .",
    "first consider @xmath12 : @xmath13 examine slow motion geodesics ( spatial velocity @xmath14 ) in this spacetime .",
    "the equation of motion which we find describes the coordinate motion of bodies reduces , in this limit , to @xmath15 in other words , the @xmath12 limit of the schwarzschild metric reproduces newtonian gravity ! clearly , the schwarzschild metric represents the external `` gravitational field '' of a monopolar mass @xmath16 in general relativity , one enforces the vacuum einstein equations and finds @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "correspondence with the newtonian limit leads to @xmath19 . ] .",
    "let us now study this metric in this coordinate systems more carefully .",
    "first , consider a `` slice '' of the spacetime with constant @xmath20 and constant @xmath21 : @xmath22 this is the metric that is used to measure the distance between points on the surface of a sphere ; in other words , this is a spherically symmetric spacetime , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 chosen to be the `` usual '' spherical angles that cover the sphere .",
    "more interestingly , this construction helps us to understand the meaning of the coordinate @xmath20 : eq .",
    "( [ eq : sphere ] ) shows us that the surface area of this sphere is just @xmath25  just as our intuition would lead us to expect .",
    "now , allow @xmath20 to vary : @xmath26 the distance between two spatial points @xmath27 and @xmath28 is _ not _ just @xmath29 as our intuition would have led us to believe !",
    "instead we must integrate the line element , @xmath30\\;.\\ ] ] the coordinate @xmath20 is an `` areal '' radius  it labels spherical surfaces of area @xmath25 , but it does _ not _ label proper distance in a simple way .    finally , we need to understand the meaning of the timelike coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "when we are _ extremely _ far from the mass @xmath16 , the line element ( [ eq : schw_metric ] ) reduces to that of flat spacetime : @xmath31 the @xmath21 coordinate is clearly time as measured by observers in this `` asymptotically flat '' region .",
    "this is the meaning of @xmath21 : it is the label that _ very distant observers _ use to measure the passing of time .",
    "this is a very convenient time label for many purposes , but is not so good for many others .",
    "for example , it is a superb coordinate for describing features that would be measured by distant observers watching processes near a black hole .",
    "it is an absolutely lousy coordinate for describing what occurs to an object that falls into a black hole .",
    "many misunderstandings about the nature of black holes are fundamentally due to the nature of the schwarzschild time coordinate .    having examined and explained the nature of the coordinates with which we have presented the schwarzschild solution , let us now begin to understand the spacetime itself .",
    "it is clear that there are some oddities we should worry about  some metric components diverge or go to zero at @xmath32 ; all metric components show funny behavior as @xmath33 .",
    "as we shall see , the first behavior reflects a coordinate singularity  the spacetime is perfectly well behaved at @xmath32 , but the coordinates are not .",
    "the second pathology by contrast reflects a real singularity  a divergence in tidal forces , reflecting a breakdown in the classical solution .      in deciding how we should regard",
    "the schwarzschild solution , perhaps the most important result to bear in mind is birkhoff s theorem :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the exterior spacetime of _ all _ spherical gravitating bodies is described by the schwarzschild metric . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the schwarzschild metric describes a portion of the spacetime of _ any _ spherically symmetric body .",
    "consider for example a spherical star of radius @xmath34 .",
    "birkhoff s theorem then guarantees that eq.([eq : schw_metric ] ) describes the star s spacetime for @xmath35 .",
    "( obviously , some other metric must describe the spacetime in the star s interior , @xmath36 , since the interior contains matter . )    in fact , birkhoff s theorem is even more powerful than this : it applies even if the spacetime is _ time dependent _ , so long as the time dependence is spherical in nature .",
    "thus , the exterior spacetime of a star that undergoes radial pulsations likewise is described by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this tells that spherical oscillations can not affect the star s exterior gravitational field .",
    "birkhoff s theorem is in fact quite simple to prove .",
    "carroll @xcite gives a very careful proof ; here , we outline a simpler proof , based on that given in mtw @xcite .",
    "we begin by writing down the general line element for a time dependent , spherical spacetime : @xmath37 [ without loss of generality , we have chosen the coefficient of the angular sector to be @xmath38 rather than some function @xmath39 . by doing so",
    ", we are choosing our coordinate @xmath20 to be an areal radius .",
    "] we can immediately simplify this by changing our time coordinate : define @xmath40 insert this into ( [ eq : birkhoff1 ] ) , define @xmath41 , and drop the primes on @xmath21 in the result .",
    "we find @xmath42 we now enforce the vacuum einstein equations : compute the einstein tensor @xmath43 and equate it to @xmath44 .",
    "( we see here why birkhoff applies to a gravitating body s exterior ; on the interior , we would set the right hand side to something appropriate to the body s interior matter distribution . )",
    "we find several differential equations that constrain the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for example , the @xmath47 component of the einstein tensor yields [ cf .",
    "mtw , eq .",
    "( 32.3b ) ] @xmath48 @xmath49 is a function of @xmath20 only  it has no time dependence .",
    "when this is taken into account , the components of the einstein tensor that determine @xmath49 are identical to the static case , and we find @xmath50 just as before .",
    "the remaining einstein tensor components constrain the function @xmath45 ; enforcing the vacuum einstein equation gives us @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary function of time ( arising as an integration constant ) .",
    "it can be eliminated by changing time variables once again : @xmath53 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is the final result of these manipulations .",
    "recall that our goal in this section is to understand how relevant the schwarzschild solution is as a description of physics , as opposed to as a simple mathematical solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "birkhoff s theorem tells us that , at the very least , this solution describes the exterior of at least some objects we might expect to encounter in the universe .",
    "however , what about for extremely compact objects ?",
    "we raised concerns about oddness at the radius @xmath32 .",
    "might there exist objects whose surfaces satisfy @xmath54 , and if so , how do we understand the nature of the spacetime in that region ?",
    "newtonian intuition @xcite suggests that we should in fact be concerned about the character of spacetime in this region .",
    "the escape speed from a spherical object of mass @xmath16 and radius @xmath55 is found by requiring that the kinetic energy per unit mass equal the work per unit mass it takes to move from @xmath56 to infinity : @xmath57 what is the radius at which the newtonian escape speed is the speed of light ?",

    ", distant observers using @xmath21 as their time label never actually see the particle fall through @xmath32  the particle only asymptotically approaches this radius as @xmath69 .",
    "there appears to be a _",
    "severe _ inconsistency here .    before explaining the source of this apparent inconsistency , it s worth examining what , if anything , the infalling body experiences at @xmath32 . as already mentioned , the fundamental gravitational `` force '' in general relativity",
    "is subsumed by the notion of tides that a body experiences .",
    "these tides are given by tensors that describe spacetime curvature ; the most important is the riemann curvature tensor . as measured by the freely falling particle , the riemann tensor s components are given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 depending on specific index values .",

    "the punchline of the preceding section is that schwarzschild coordinates are not a good way to describe the kinematics of objects that pass through the event horizon .",
    "fortunately , we can transform to different coordinates which do a much better job of illustrating aspects of motion in the strong field of the schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "we can not pretend that the perfectly symmetric collapse process which produces schwarzschild black holes even approximates realistic astrophysical processes .",

    "geodesics in this spacetime show that objects are dragged by the hole s rotation  in essence , the gravitational field rotates , dragging everything nearby to co - rotate with it . because of this , kerr is not a static spacetime , like schwarzschild ; the adjective used to describe it is `` stationary '' .",
    "the spacetime does not vary with time , but frame dragging makes it impossible for static observers to exist near the black hole . in the vicinity of a schwarzschild black hole , one can always arrange for an observer to sit in a static manner relative to distant observers .",
    "it may require an enormously powerful rocket to prevent that observer from falling through the horizon ; but no issue of principle prevents one from using such a rocket .",
    "by contrast , close enough to the horizon of a kerr black hole , _ all _ observers are forced to co - rotate relative to very distant observers , no matter how strongly they fight that tendency .",
    "unfortunately , though perhaps not surprisingly , there is no simple collapse model akin to a rotating o - s collapse which demonstrates that kerr black holes are produced by collapse .",
    "fortunately , numerical calculations due in fact show this ; see for example ref ..    the kerr black hole is clearly far more relevant to astrophysical discussions than the schwarzschild solution  it rotates , and it is not spherically symmetric .",
    "one might wonder : are we done ?",
    "for example , are there additional black hole solutions with no symmetry ? as we shall now discuss , the kerr black hole is in fact the _ unique _ black hole solution within general relativity .",
    "furthermore , it is _ stable _ : if something momentarily disturbs the hole so that the kerr solution does not perfectly describe the spacetime , the hole will vibrate momentarily and then settle back down to the kerr solution .",
    "taken together , these statements of uniqueness and stability tell us that * kerr black holes are the ultimate outcome of gravitational collapse in general relativity*.",

    "the first part of this exercise is a description of the black hole uniqueness theorems .",
    "they establish that _ the kerr black hole is the unique uncharged black hole solution within general relativity_. the uniqueness theorems are known collectively as the `` no - hair '' theorem , meaning that a black hole has no distinguishing features ( no hair ) , except for its mass and spin .",
    "the next part is a discussion of stability and price s theorem , which establish the mechanism by which nature enforces the no - hair theorem .    before going into this discussion ,",
    "one might wonder : should we consider charged black holes ?",
    "for example , a non - spinning black hole with mass @xmath16 and charge @xmath146 is described by the reissner - nordstrom metric @xcite , @xmath147 generalization to includes spin ( the kerr - newman metric ) is also known .",
    "should we consider these black holes in our discussion ?",
    "at least on the rather long timescales relevant to measuring the properties of black hole candidates , the answer to this question is clearly _",
    "no_. typical astrophysical black holes are embedded in environments that are rich in gas and plasma .",
    "any net charge will be rapidly neutralized by the ambient plasma . the time scale for this to occur is very rapid , scaling roughly with the hole s mass : @xmath148 .",
    "if charged black holes play any role in astrophysics , it will only be on very short timescales  far shorter than is relevant for observations which probe the nature of the black hole itself .",
    "the no - hair theorem tells us that ( modulo the above discussion of charge ) , _ the only black hole solution is given by the kerr metric_. a corollary of this is that black holes are _ completely _ described by only two parameters , mass and spin . *",
    "no matter how complicated the initial state , collapse to a black hole removes all `` hair '' , leaving a simple final state . *",
    "this is a remarkable statement .",
    "suppose that we begin with two objects which are completely different  a massive star near the end of its life on one hand ; a gigantic pile of elderly winnebago campers on the other .",
    "we crush each object into a black hole such that each has the same mass @xmath16 and spin @xmath149 .",
    "the no - hair theorem tells us that _ there is no way to distinguish these objects_. all information about their highly different initial state is lost by the time the event horizon forms .",
    "this remarkable feature of classical black holes is among their most bothersome ; it is thus worth examining this aspect with some care .",
    "the first result which begins to establish the general no - hair result was a theorem that was proved by werner israel in a 1967 publication @xcite .",

    "( this is demonstrated by figs .  2 and 3 , in which the event horizon clearly corresponds to a piece of a light cone . )",
    "the technical details of the proof demonstrate that this null surface must be spherically symmetric in static spacetimes if the spacetime is asymptotically flat ( more precisely , that spatial slices are asymptotically euclidean ) and if the curvature is well - behaved over the spacetime ( i.e. , it is smooth and bounded , with no singularities ) .      applying as it does only to static and spherically symmetric spacetimes , israel s theorem , though a landmark in understanding the generic properties of black hole spacetimes , is of somewhat limited applicability to astrophysics .",

    "it may seem intuitively clear that the israel - carter - robinson theorems can not possibly apply to , for example , newly born black holes that form during supernova explosions ; such situations are so highly dynamical and asymmetric that there must be some `` structure '' ( broadly speaking ) that makes the spacetime more complicated than that of the kerr metric .",
    "fortunately , the no - hair theorem has a built in loophole : it requires the spacetime to be _",

    "the mechanism by which the `` balding '' proceeds is most easily explained for small deviations using black hole perturbation theory ; our discussion here follows that of rezzolla @xcite .",

    "after sufficient material accumulates , it undergoes unstable thermonuclear burning , which we observe as an x - ray burst .",
    "a key element of this model is that the compact object _ must have a surface_. material can not accumulate on an event horizon , and so no bursts can come from an x - ray binary whose compact object is a black hole .",
    "observations show that _ bursts are only seen if the compact object s mass is sufficiently low that it is probably a neutron star _ @xcite .",

    "the galactic center is about 7000 parsecs away , so the horizon subtends an angle of about 0.01 milliarcseconds on the sky .",
    "this is not too far from what might be achievable in the near future using very long baseline radio interferometry .",
    "indeed , recent observations have shown that this source must have a size smaller than about 1 astronomical unit @xcite ; the precision required for this measurement is within an order of magnitude or so of what is needed to probe the region near the event horizon .",
    "what we really want to measure is the horizon s _ shadow _ : the `` hole '' cast in background radiation due to the presence of the event horizon .",
    "because of the bending and focusing of radiation in the strong gravitational field of a black hole , the shadow will be somewhat larger than the event horizon . for a schwarzschild black hole",
    ", the shadow would be a perfect circle @xmath185 times larger than the event horizon .",
    "for rotating black holes ( the generic case which we expect ) , the shadow is expected to be somewhat asymmetric due to frame dragging  the bending of light is not symmetric . getting the resolution required to do",

    "this idea is discussed in detail in ref .",

    "another feature is that the familiar keplerian orbital period , @xmath192 ( where @xmath126 is orbital semi - major axis ) is split into 3 distinct periods , corresponding to motions in @xmath20 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "these periods are shown in fig .  5 ; notice that they asymptote to the kepler result far from the black hole , but are strongly split in the strong field . the distinct character of these orbital timescales is a fingerprint of the black hole strong field .    [",
    "fig : periods ]    at least two types of measurements have the promise to probe orbits in the strong field and to observe these distinct behaviors : x - ray measurements of accretion ( the flow of gas onto the black hole in these potentials ) , and gravitational waves ( arising from the motion of bodies orbiting in these potentials ) .",
    "a particularly interesting strong - field hallmark visible in some accreting systems is a fluorescence line associated with iron , the fe k@xmath193 line . in the rest frame",
    ", this line is expected to be a sharp feature at an energy of @xmath194 kev .",
    "the observed lines are highly broadened from @xmath195 to @xmath196 kev  both blueshifted and redshifted due to a combination of the gravitational redshift and the rapid whirling motion of gas near the black hole . with some assumptions about the nature and structure of the gaseous disk from the radiation",
    "originates , measurement of such lines makes it possible to estimate the spin of massive black holes @xcite ; clean , high signal - to - noise data may make it possible to constrain the spacetime even more sharply , perhaps enabling a careful test of the black hole hypothesis .",
    "future gravitational wave observations likewise promise to enable careful studies of black hole spacetimes .",
    "gravitational waves are generated by a source with a varying mass quadrupole moment ; binary systems are a perfect example of a strong gravitational radiator . it is expected that galactic black holes will occasionally capture a smaller compact object ( @xmath197 black hole or @xmath198 neutron star ) @xcite .",
    "that compact object will generate gravitational waves with spectral content at all of the orbital frequencies , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 , as well as harmonics of those frequencies .",
    "indeed , those frequencies will slowly evolve as the small body loses orbital energy and angular momentum due to the waves backreaction ; by tracking the evolution , a great deal of information can in principle be extracted .",
    "future space - based gravitational - wave missions ( see larson s contribution to this summer school ) are expected to measure these waves well enough to precisely determine the masses and spins of black holes @xcite , and should be able to check whether the spacetime satisfies the stringent requirements of the black hole hypothesis @xcite .",
    "unambiguous observational evidence for the existence of astrophysical black holes has not yet been established .",
    "the moral of classical general relativity is that black holes must be created in the right circumstances ; and , they must be driven to a particularly simple , unique form .",
