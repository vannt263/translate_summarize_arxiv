    "terahertz radiation ( @xmath0 thz ) has enormous number of promising applications in different areas of science and technology , not least because certain important molecular resonances occur at thz frequencies .",
    "one of the main challenges is to construct a coherent miniature source / amplifier of thz radiation that can operate at room temperature .",
    "the classical works of esaki and tsu@xcite and ktitorov _ et al._@xcite stimulated enormous activity devoted to the non - linear interaction of a high - frequency electric field with miniband electrons in dc - biased superlattice .",
    "bloch oscillations of miniband electrons in a such kind of system can , in principle , result in an amplification of thz radiation ( for a review , see ref .  ) . the main problem in the realization of these thz amplifiers is a formation of high - field electric domains inside a superlattice under conditions of negative differential conductivity@xcite ( ndc ) .",
    "electric domains are destructive for gain at thz frequencies.@xcite several novel ideas have been recently introduced in order to solve the problem ( see ref .   and papers cited therein ) .",
    "another suggested type of thz amplifiers with a superlattice as an active element is based on a coherent interaction of alternating electric fields with two commensurate frequencies ( refs .   ) . in recent letters@xcite",
    "we clarified the parametric nature of this effect and found that it can exist without switching the operation point to the ndc part of the time - average voltage - current characteristic of the superlattice .",
    "this theoretical result allows to expect that the undesirable electric instability can be effectively suppressed in the case of parametric gain .",
    "the parametric amplifiers are characterized by a time - variation of a reactive parameter which pumps energy into an amplified signal , if the phases and the frequencies of the signal and parameter are suitably related.@xcite in a single miniband superlattice the parametric resonance occurs due to oscillations of the effective mass of miniband electrons@xcite , which is caused by the pump field @xmath1 in such _ degenerate _ parametric amplifier there is only one resonator mode whose frequency @xmath2 is a harmonic or half harmonic of @xmath3 .",
    "the degenerate amplification in superlattices has been analyzed in several physically interesting limits , including the quasistatic@xcite ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and `` semiquasistatic '' limits@xcite ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the intraband relaxation time ) .",
    "the degenerate parametric amplification is a phase - sensitive process . on the other hand , _ nondegenerate _",
    "parametric amplifiers can provide a phase - insensitive amplification of a given signal.@xcite in this case there are two resonator modes with incommensurate frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is an integer ) .",
    "there still exist a few publications devoted to the nondegenerate parametric amplification in superlattices.@xcite    in this paper , we re - examine the problem of nondegenerate parametric amplification in single miniband of superlattices and analyze the limits of weak ( @xmath12 ) and strong ( @xmath13 ) dissipation . in the limit of weak dissipation ,",
    "we show that our formulas for absorption and gain satisfy the well - known manley - rowe relations.@xcite we concentrate mainly on the small - signal amplification and demonstrate that the net absorptions of weak probe fields in superlattice always consist of two distinct terms describing the incoherent and parametric mechanisms .",
    "we find that for both frequency relations @xmath10 and odd @xmath11 the parametric term is zero in unbiased ( @xmath14 ) superlattice .",
    "our results provide a mathematical background also for analysis of the nondegenerate parametric amplification in various other physical systems demonstrating nonlinear transport in a single energy band .",

    "the incoherent absorptions become @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the esaki - tsu critical field corresponding to the peak current and @xmath85 is defined in ( [ et ] ) .",
    "we see that the incoherent absorptions are proportional to the dc differential conductivity , and thus in conditions where the domain formation is suppressed they are always positive.@xcite    similarly the coherent absorptions in the quasistatic limit can also be represented as integrals . in the case of @xmath47",
    "we get from formulas ( [ absnondeg1coh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg1aicoh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg1aiicoh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg1bicoh ] ) and ( [ absnondeg1biicoh ] ) that @xmath86 whereas in the case of @xmath52 , formulas ( [ absnondeg2coh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg2aicoh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg2aiicoh ] ) , ( [ absnondeg2bicoh ] ) and ( [ absnondeg2biicoh ] ) are transformed to @xmath87 we can make two important remarks concerning these equations .",

    "thus we can immediately say that the parametric gain can overcome the incoherent absorption leading to amplification of the probe fields in conditions where the formation of electric domains is suppressed .",
    "secondly , we have an interesting relation for the coherent parts of the generated / absorbed power @xmath88 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "namely @xmath89    finally , we would like to outline the differences in amplification / attenuation of the probe fields for the two mixing relations @xmath10 in a variation of the dissipation strength . in the case",
    "@xmath47 , the _ simultaneous amplification _ of both modes is possible both in the limit of weak ( [ manley1 ] ) and strong dissipation ( [ strongdis ] ) . the main difference in this case is the change in the phase - dependence of absorptions from sine ( [ bal1 ] ) , ( [ bal2 ] ) to cosine ( [ quasistcoh1 ] ) with an increase of dissipation . in the case",
    "@xmath52 , the changes are more drastic .",
    "whereas the simultaneous amplification of both modes is possible in the limit of strong dissipation ( [ strongdis ] ) , it is forbidden in the limit of weak dissipation ( [ manley2 ] ) .",
    "we contributed to the theory of nondegenerate parametric amplification in superlattices .",
    "we showed that the solution of boltzmann transport equation for a tight - binding lattice satisfies the manley - rowe relation in the limit of weak dissipation .",
    "it demonstrates that we are really dealing with the parametric processes .",
    "our theory predicts that in semiconductor superlattices the amplification of electric field can potentially be reached in a wide range of frequencies from microwaves up to high terahertz .",
    "we believe that similar parametric effects can be realized in various other physical systems . here",
    "we would like to mention only two of them : nitride semiconductors and optical lattices .",
    "since the dependence of effective mass on the energy density in the lower part of the conduction band of dilute nitride alloys@xcite resembles the corresponding dependence occurring in the miniband of superlattices , we speculate that our theories of nondegenerate and degenerate parametric amplification can be also applicable to these bulk semiconductors . on the other hand",
    ", the tight - binding optical lattices filled with cold atoms or bose - einstein condensates can demonstrate nonlinear transport in a single energy band in the both dissipative@xcite and nondissipative limits@xcite .",
    "therefore the optical lattices can be considered as a playground for the demonstration of ac - driven transport satisfying the manley - rowe relations . a detailed study of the parametric resonance in these interesting systems goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
