    "the physics of equilibrium phase transition in the ising model is well understood @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism behind the nonequilibrium phase transition is not yet explored rigorously and the basic phenomenology is still undeveloped .",
    "it is quite interesting to study how the system behaves if it is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "the simplest prototype example is the kinetic ising model in oscillating magnetic field . in this context",
    ", the dynamic response of the ising system in presence of an oscillating magnetic field has been studied extensively @xcite in the last few years .",
    "the dynamic hysteresis @xcite and the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition @xcite are two important aspects of the dynamic response of the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field , was first studied by tome and oliviera @xcite .",
    "they solved the mean - field ( mf ) dynamic equation of motion ( for the average magnetization ) of the kinetic ising model in presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field . by defining the dynamic order parameter",
    "as the time averaged magnetization over a full cycle of the oscillating magnetic field , they showed that depending upon the value of the field amplitude and the temperature , the dynamic order parameter takes nonzero value from a zero value . in the field amplitude and temperature plane there",
    "exists a distinct phase boundary separating dynamic ordered ( nonzero value of order parameter ) and disordered ( order parameter vanishes ) phase . a tricritical point ( tcp ) , ( separating the nature ( discontinuous - continuous ) of the transition ) on the phase boundary line ,",
    "was also observed by them @xcite .",
    "however , one may argue that such a mean - field transition is not truly dynamic in origin since it exists even in the quasi - static ( or zero frequency ) limit .",
    "this is because , if the field amplitude is less than the coercive field ( at temperature less than the transition temperature without any field ) , then the response magnetization varies periodically but asymmetrically even in the zero frequency limit ; the system remains locked to one well of the free energy and can not go to the other one , in the absence of fluctuation .",
    "the true dynamic nature of this kind of phase transition ( in presence of fluctuation ) was first attemted to study by lo and pelcovits @xcite .",
    "they have studied the dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation which allows the microscopic fluctuations .",
    "here , the transition disappears in the zero frequency limit ; due to the fluctuations , the magnetization flips to the direction of the magnetic field and the dynamic order parameter ( time averaged magnetization ) vanishes .",
    "however , they @xcite have not reported any precise phase boundary .",
    "acharyya and chakrabarti @xcite studied the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of oscillating magnetic field by extensive mc simulation .",
    "they @xcite have also identified that this dynamic phase transition ( at a particular nonzero frequency of the oscillating magnetic field ) is associated with the breaking of the symmetry of the dynamic hysteresis ( @xmath0 ) loop . in the dynamically disordered phase ( where the value of order parameter vanishes ) the corresponding hysteresis loop is symmetric , and loses its symmetry in the ordered phase ( giving nonzero value of dynamic order parameter ) .",
    "they @xcite also studied the temperature variation of the ac susceptibility components near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the major observation was that the imaginary ( real ) part of the ac susceptibility gives a peak ( dip ) near the dynamic transition point ( where the dynamic order parameter vanishes ) .",
    "the important conclusions were : ( i ) this is a distinct signal of phase transition and ( ii ) this is an indication of the thermodynamic nature of the phase transition .",
    "the debye relaxation of the dynamic order parameter and the critical slowing down have been studied very recently @xcite both by mc simulation and by solving the dynamic mf equation @xcite of motion for the average magnetization .",
    "the specific - heat singularity @xcite near the dynamic transition point is also an indication of the thermodynamic nature of this dynamic phase transition .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the statistical distribution of dynamic order parameter has been studied by sides et al @xcite .",
    "the nature of the distribution changes ( from bimodal to unimodal ) near the dynamic transition point .",
    "they have also observed @xcite that the fluctuation of the hysteresis loop area becomes considerably large near the dynamic transition point .    in the case of equilibrium phase transitions , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) states ( due to the applicability of gibbs formalism ) that the mean square fluctuations of some intrinsic physical quantities ( say , energy , magnetization etc . )",
    "are directly related with some responses ( specific heat , susceptibility etc . ) of the system .",
    "consequently , near the ferro - para transition point , both the fluctuation of magnetization and the susceptibilty show same singular behavior .",
    "if it is of power law type , the same singular behavior will be characterised by the same exponent .",
    "this is also true for fluctuation of energy and the specific heat .",
    "these are the consequences of fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . here , the main motivation is to study the fluctuations and corresponding responses near the dynamic transition temperature .    in this paper , the fluctuations of dynamic order parameter and the energy are studied as a function of temperature near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the temperature variations of ` susceptibility ' and the specific - heat are also studied near the transition point .",
    "the temperature variation of the fluctuation of dynamic order parameter and that of the ` susceptibility ' are compared .",
    "similarly , the temperature variation of the fluctuation of energy and that of the ` specific - heat ' are compared .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the model and the simulation scheme are discussed in section ii , the results are reported in section iii , section iv contains the summary of the work .",
    "the ising model with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic coupling in presence of a time varying magnetic field can be represented by the hamiltonian    @xmath1    here , @xmath2 is ising spin variable , @xmath3 is the interaction strength and @xmath4 represents the oscillating magnetic field , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and the frequency respectively of the oscillating field .",
    "the system is in contact with an isothermal heat bath at temperature @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    "all @xmath8 are taken equal to unity and the boundary condition is chosen to be periodic .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath7 ) is measured in the unit of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant ( here @xmath10 is taken unity ) .",
    "a square lattice of linear size @xmath11 has been considered . at any finite temperature @xmath7 and for a fixed frequency ( @xmath6 ) and amplitude ( @xmath5 ) of the field , the microscopic dynamics of this system has been studied here by monte carlo simulation using glauber single spin - flip dynamics with a particular choice of the metropolis rate of single spin - flip @xcite .",
    "starting from an initial condition where all spins are up , each lattice site is updated here sequentially and one such full scan over the entire lattice is defined as the unit time step ( monte carlo step or mcs ) .",
    "the instanteneous magnetization ( per site ) , @xmath12 has been calculated . from the instanteneous magnetization , the dynamic order parameter @xmath13 ( time averaged magnetization over a full cycle of the oscillating field )",
    "is calculated .",
    "some of the transient loops have been discarded to get the stable value of the dynamical quantities .",
    "the fluctuation of the dynamic order parameter is @xmath14 where the @xmath15 stands for the averaging over various monte carlo samples .",
    "the ` susceptibility ' is defined as @xmath16    here , a square lattice of linear size @xmath17 ( = 100 ) has been considered .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are calculated using mc simulation .",
    "the averaging has been done over 100 different ( uncorrelated ) mc samples .",
    "the temperature variations of fluctuation of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 and ` susceptibility ' @xmath22 have been studied here and both plotted in fig .",
    "1 . from the figure",
    "it is observed that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 diverge near the dynamic transition point ( where @xmath20 vanishes ) .",
    "this has been studied for two different values of field amplitude @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "1b is for @xmath5 = 0.1 ) .",

    "results show that both @xmath22 and @xmath21 diverge near @xmath33 as a power law with the same exponent @xmath34 , though there is a crossover region ( where the effective exponent values are different ) .",
    "the time averaged ( over a full cycle ) cooperative energy of the system is    @xmath35 and the fluctuation of the cooperative energy is @xmath36    the ` specific - heat ' @xmath37 @xcite is defined as the derivative of the energy ( defined above ) with respect to the temperature , and @xmath38    here , also a square lattice of linear size @xmath17 ( = 100 ) has been considered .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are calculated using mc simulation .",

    "the temperature variation of fluctuation of energy , @xmath41 has been studied and plotted in fig .",
    "2 . from the figure it is clear that the mean square fluctuation of energy ( @xmath42 ) and the specific heat ( @xmath37 ) both diverge near the dynamic transition point ( where the dynamic order parameter @xmath20 vanishes )",

    "the temperatures @xmath23 , at which @xmath37 and @xmath42 diverge , are 1.91@xmath24 for @xmath5 = 0.2 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and 2.15@xmath430.01 for @xmath5 = 0.1 ( fig .",
    ". these values also agree with the phase diagram estimated from vanishing of @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath44 vs. @xmath27 and @xmath45 vs. @xmath27 plots show ( insets of fig .",
    "2 ) that @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for @xmath5 = 0.2 , @xmath48 ( inset of fig .",
    "2a ) and for @xmath5 = 0.1 , @xmath49 ( inset of fig .",

    "the nonequlibrium dynamic phase transition , in the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field , is studied by monte carlo simulation .",
    "acharyya and chakrabarti @xcite observed that the complex susceptibility components have peaks ( or dips ) at the dynamic transition point .",
    "sides et al @xcite observed that the fluctuation in the hysteresis loop area grows ( seems to diverge ) near the dynamic transition point .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the relaxation time and the appropriately defined specific - heat diverge near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the mean square fluctuation of dynamic order parameter and the ` susceptibility ' are studied as a function of temperature , near the dynamic transition point .",
    "both shows the power law variation with respect to the reduced temperature near the dynamic transition point with the same exponent values .",
    "similar , observation has been made for the case of mean square fluctuation of energy and the ` specific - heat ' .",
    "it appears that although the effective exponent values for the fluctuation and the appropriate linear resoponse differ considerably , away from the dynamic transition point @xmath33 , they eventually converge and give identical value as the temperature interval @xmath50 decreases and falls within a narrow crossover region .",
    "these numerical observations indicate that the fluctuation- dissipation relation @xcite holds good in this case of the nonequilibrium phase transition in the kinetic ising model .",
    "however , at this stage there is no analytic support of the fdt in this case .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned , in this context , that experiments @xcite on ultrathin ferromagnetic fe / au(001 ) films have been performed to study the frequency dependence of hysteresis loop areas .",
    "recently , attempts have been made @xcite to measure the dynamic order parameter @xmath20 experimentally , in the same material , by extending their previous study @xcite .",
    "the dynamic phase transition has been studied from the observed temperature variation of @xmath20 .",
    "however , the detailed investigation of the dynamic phase transitions by measuring variations of associated response functions ( like the ac susceptibility , specific - heat , correlations , relaxations etc ) have not yet been performed experimentally .",
