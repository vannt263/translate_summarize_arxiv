    "according to the unification model for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the only difference between type  1 ( broad - line ) and type  2 ( narrow - line ) sources is the observer s orientation with respect to the toroidal dusty obscuration .",
    "directions with clear sight of the central engine and the broad - line region ( blr ) yield type  1 sources , while those blocked by the torus from direct view of the blr result in type  2 objects , where the existence of the hidden blr is revealed only in polarized light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in spite of the considerable success of the unification scheme there is now clear evidence , recently summarized by @xcite , that the blr is actually missing , and not just hidden , in many low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) .",
    "these sources have been named  pure \" @xcite or  true \" @xcite type  2 agns . why does the blr disappear in llagns ?    in another important recent development , the obscuring torus is found to be a smooth continuation of the blr , not a separate entity .",
    "primary evidence comes from the @xcite discovery that the blr extends outward until the inner boundary of the dusty torus , in agreement with the @xcite proposal that the blr outer boundary is set by dust sublimation .",
    "additionally , @xcite find that x - ray variability caused by passage of absorbing clouds across the line - of - sight has a continuous behavior across the time scales generated by the motions of dust - free blr clouds close to the agn and the more distant , dusty torus clouds . together",
    ", these observations show that the blr and the torus are simply the inner and outer regions , respectively , of a single , continuous cloud distribution .",
    "their different radiative signatures merely reflect the change in cloud composition across the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the inner clouds are dust - free , and their gas is directly exposed to the agn ionizing continuum ; therefore , the gas is atomic and ionized , producing the broad emission lines .",
    "the outer clouds are dusty , and so their gas is shielded from the ionizing radiation , and the atomic line emission is quenched .",
    "instead , these clouds are molecular and dusty , obscuring the ultraviolet / optical emission from the inner regions and emitting infrared radiation . within this framework ,",
    "the blr occupies @xmath3 while the torus is simply the region at @xmath4 , and a more appropriate designation for it is the `` toroidal obscuration region '' ( tor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the blr / tor structure arises naturally in the disk - wind scenario , first proposed by @xcite . in this model",
    ", the two classes of clouds simply correspond to different regions of a clumpy wind coming off the accretion disk rotating around the black hole ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as the clouds rise away from the disk they expand and lose their column density , limiting the vertical scope of broad - line emission and dust obscuration and emission , resulting in a toroidal geometry for both the blr and the tor .",
    "although a theory of clumpy disk winds in agns is far from full development , an immediate consequence of this scenario is the prediction that the tor and blr disappear at low bolometric luminosities ( i.e. , low accretion rates ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason is that , as the mass accretion rate decreases , the mass outflow rate of a disk wind with fixed radial column decreases more slowly and thus can not be sustained below a certain accretion limit .",
    "this unavoidable conclusion follows from simple considerations of mass conservation .",
    "however , in the absence of a complete theory for the outflow dynamics , the actual limit and its detailed dependence on the agn parameters remain undetermined .",
    "presently , the only practical approach is to attempt to extract clues on these unknowns from analysis of llagn data .",
    "this is the approach taken here .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the agn bolometric luminosity and by @xmath6 the black hole mass . from mass conservation , disk outflow can support the column densities required by the blr and tor only when the luminosity obeys @xcite .",
    "the derivation of this result is repeated below in  [ sec : mdot ] , where we analyze in detail the assumptions and provide the expression for the numerical coefficient @xmath7 in terms of system properties other than @xmath8 and @xmath1 . replacing the mass with the eddington luminosity , @xmath9 , produces the luminosity lower bound in terms of eddington ratio where @xmath10 . in the absence of a detailed theoretical model for the disk wind , our ignorance about the dynamics",
    "is contained in the numerical coefficient @xmath7 . the only way to determine whether @xmath7 may contain additional , indirect dependence on @xmath8 or @xmath1 is to compare the bounds in eqs.[eq : bound1 ] and [ eq : bound2 ] with observations .",
    "we use data selected from the palomar spectroscopic survey of 486 nearby galaxies @xcite , the most sensitive and complete sample of llagns available .",
    "a critical new development is that the majority of the palomar galaxies now have reliable estimates of their nuclear luminosities and black hole masses @xcite .",
    "we consider all galaxies classified as seyferts , low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , and transition objects , which , as argued in @xcite , are variants of llagns that define a sequence of varying accretion rates .",
    "we also include absorption - line nuclei , objects with undetected optical line emission that are good candidates of hosting inactive black holes .",
    "high - resolution , hard - x - ray measurements provide the most robust measure of the accretion luminosity in agns , especially for weak sources . of",
    "the 277 palomar galaxies meeting our classification criteria , 166 ( 60% ) have suitable nuclear x - ray ( 210 kev ) fluxes or upper limits thereof @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these x - ray measurements can be converted to bolometric luminosities with an accuracy of @xmath11 dex .",
    "importantly , all but one of the galaxies has reliable measurements of the central stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , from which the black hole mass can be estimated to within @xmath11 dex using the well - established relation between black hole mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the distributions of data points in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 planes .",
    "the palomar llagns are coded according to spectral class and presence or absence of broad h@xmath14 emission @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also include the sample of low - redshift luminous seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars studied by @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that , depending on either the black hole mass or eddington ratio , type  1 sources cease to exist below a certain luminosity .",
    "( the only exception is the liner 1 galaxy ngc 2787 , whose luminosity of  is 0.45 dex below the drawn boundary line . )",
    "we interpret this critical luminosity to be the threshold below which the blr disappears in the disk - wind model .",
    "the solid line in each panel represents the bound with the slope taken from either eq .",
    "[ eq : bound1 ] or [ eq : bound2 ] , as appropriate .",
    "the line intercepts were adjusted to coincide with the observed type  1@xmath15type  2 boundary , yielding @xmath16 , i.e. , the blr existence requires @xmath17 .",
    "consider an outflow coming off an annular segment of a disk .",
    "denote by @xmath18 the density and @xmath19 the vertical component of outflow velocity at axial radius @xmath20 on the disk surface .",
    "then the outflow mass loss rate is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean atomic mass .",
    "since the dust sublimation radius  sets a characteristic scale for both the blr and tor , it is convenient to introduce the scaled radius @xmath23 and the dimensionless velocity profile @xmath24 . introduce also @xmath25 , the overall column density along a radius vector on the disk surface .",
    "we can describe the radial density variation by the dimensionless profile @xmath26 , normalized from @xmath27 .",
    "then where @xmath28 is a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "written in terms of the radial column density @xmath29 , this basic expression provides the mass outflow rate of any disk wind , whether smooth or clumpy ; in the latter case @xmath30 is the cloud liftoff velocity and the profile @xmath31 describes the variation of number of clouds per unit radial length .",
    "the dust sublimation radius in agns is @xmath32pc @xcite .",
    "the initial outflow velocity , @xmath30 , is roughly the dispersion velocity of material in the disk  an outflow is established when the ordered motion velocity becomes comparable to that of the local random motions .",
    "we now make the assumption that this velocity is some fraction @xmath33 of the local keplerian velocity , @xmath34 .",
    "maser observations of the nuclear disk in ngc  3079 show that the velocity dispersion is  14 in a small region of strong emission where the keplerian velocity is 110 @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that @xmath33 is probably of order  0.1 . with this assumption , the mass outflow rate becomes where @xmath35 .",
    "this expression applies both for the blr and tor portions of the disk wind .    in steady state ,",
    "can not exceed , the mass accretion rate into the blr / tor region .",
    "a fraction @xmath36 of this accreted mass finds its way to the black hole and is converted to the agn bolometric luminosity with radiative efficiency @xmath31 so that @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 and where @xmath39 .",
    "steady - state mass conservation requires @xmath40 , yielding eq .",
    "[ eq : bound1 ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the observational result @xmath16 implies @xmath42 . from photoionization modeling of broad - line emission",
    ", the blr requires a minimal column density of   @xmath43 @xcite , and so @xmath44 . we can reasonably take @xmath45 and @xmath46 , yielding @xmath47 ; since the factors @xmath36 and @xmath31 do not enter separately , only their product is constrained .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath36 can be obtained from self - similar hydromagnetic disk - wind models .",
    "the wind applies a back torque on the underlying disk because each magnetic field line can be considered rigid from its footpoint @xmath20 up to the alfvn radius @xmath48 .",
    "angular momentum conservation implies that @xmath49 is roughly the ratio of the mass fluxes for outflow and accretion , or @xmath50 .",
    "this ratio is found to be either independent of @xmath20 @xcite or weakly dependent on it @xcite , with a value of @xmath51 .",
    "the fraction of  that reaches the black hole is @xmath52 , therefore @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "such a low radiative efficiency places the blr disappearance in the domain of radiatively inefficient or advection - dominated accretion flow solutions ( for recent reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a  standard \" accretion efficiency @xmath55 would require virtually the entire mass accreted into the blr / tor to be carried away by the wind , with only a fraction @xmath56 reaching the black hole .",
    "this seems unlikely .",
    "quenching of the blr / tor at low accretion rates is an unavoidable consequence of the disk - wind scenario .",
    "the reason is that the mass outflow rate is set by the radial column density @xmath29 and by the scales of the local radius and keplerian velocity ( eq .  [ eq : basic ] ) . since the blr / tor boundary is set by a fixed value of the radiative flux , the radial scale increases with luminosity as @xmath57 and the velocity scale decreases as @xmath58 .",
    "keeping @xmath29 constant , as appropriate for both the blr and tor , the mass outflow rate varies with @xmath8 as @xmath59 , more slowly than the linear variation of the accretion rate .",
    "disk - wind mass conservation implies that the minimal column required by an observable blr can not be sustained below a certain luminosity .",
    "the data verify that this is indeed the case and indicate that the transition to `` true '' type 2 agns occurs in the regime of radiatively inefficient accretion .",
    "this adds support to independent indicators that llagns accrete in the advection - dominated mode ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "bounds similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : bound1 ] were derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both concluded independently that the blr should disappear when the luminosity drops below some @xmath60 , where @xmath7 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "replacing @xmath1 with the eddington ratio , this condition produces significantly different results depending on the value of @xmath14 : when @xmath61 it implies a lower limit @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is derived from @xmath7 , but when @xmath64 the result is an _ upper _ bound @xmath65 ; in between , @xmath66 implies that the blr exists only above some fixed eddington ratio .",
    "increases , the bound is rotating clockwise in the @xmath67 plane , passing through vertical at @xmath66 , with blr sources located ahead of the rotating boundary . ]",
    "nicastro suggests a disk outflow origin for the blr , as here , and uses the disk / corona model of @xcite to derive @xmath68 , practically indistinguishable from the @xmath69 found here . however , nicastro s bound translates into @xmath70 , a much steeper boundary than indicated by the data in the @xmath13 plane ( figure 1 ) .",
    "laor suggests the existence of an upper limit to blr velocities , which leads to @xmath71 . because @xmath64 in this case , it yields @xmath72 .",
    "this bound is orthogonal to the one plotted in panel ( b ) of figure 1 and all agn with blr should lie _ below _ it , a prediction that seems in clear conflict with the data .",
    "as these examples show , examining the data in the @xmath73 plane amplifies the differences between models ; while eq .",
    "[ eq : bound2 ] describes adequately the data in figure 1(b ) , the other models do not .",
    "the derivation of the blr / tor disappearance presented here is more general than the original one in @xcite .",
    "equation [ eq : m_out ] holds irrespective of the wind clumpiness and applies equally to the blr and tor portions of the disk outflow , with @xmath74 the radial column density through each pertinent segment . in both regions ,",
    "@xmath75 can be considered a reasonable lower limit for the blr to generate line emission and the tor to produce substantial obscuration .",
    "the only significant difference between the two cases enters from the factor @xmath76 ( eq .  [ eq : basic ] ) : denoting the inner and outer radii of the disk wind by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , the integration in  extends from @xmath79 to 1 , while in  it is from 1 to @xmath80 .",
    "we can reasonably assume keplerian behavior for the velocity profile , i.e. , @xmath81 , and parametrize the density profile with a power law , @xmath82 , so that the integrand is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "depending on @xmath84 , different relations exist between  and .",
    "the range @xmath85 yields @xmath86 , @xmath87 produces @xmath88 , while @xmath89 results in @xmath90 .",
    "the larger is @xmath76 , the earlier does the quenching of the outflow occur as the luminosity is decreasing .",
    "therefore , depending on the steepness of the radial density profile , the blr and tor may disappear either together , when @xmath91 , or in sequence : in agns with steep profiles ( @xmath89 ; @xmath92 ) the blr will disappear first ; in shallow ones ( @xmath93 ; @xmath94 ) the tor .",
    "recent clumpy torus modeling of extended ir data sets @xcite suggests that @xmath84 can range anywhere from 0 to 3 in different sources , indicating that no single rule applies to all agns  sources with and without tor can exist on either side of the blr boundary . in",
    "any given agn , the tor disappearance can be established from the lack of ir emission at a level commensurate with the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the absence of a tor in m87 was demonstrated conclusively by @xcite , who placed stringent limits on the thermal ir emission , and further solidified by @xcite , who found only a trace of thermal emission that is much weaker than expected from an agn torus and that can be attributed to neighboring dust .",
    "detailed studies of the ir emission from sources close to the blr boundary established in figure 1 can be a powerful tool for probing the density distribution around the black hole in llagns and clarifying the nature of the blr / tor disk outflow .                                                                      , and ( _ b _ ) eddington ratios , @xmath95 , vs. bolometric luminosity , @xmath8 , for objects separated by spectral classification .",
