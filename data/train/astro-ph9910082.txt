    "<S> we have used hst - wfpc2 multiband observations of a field around sn  1987a in the large magellanic cloud to measure its distance from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the observations allowed us to carefully determine the interstellar extinction along the line of sight to a large number of stars and to measure the lmc distance by using two stellar distance indicators : the red clump and the tip of the red giant branch . from an application of the red clump method we obtain a distance modulus @xmath0=18.59@xmath10.04@xmath10.08  _ mag _ ( statistical plus systematic error ) , in good agreement with the distance derived by using the tip of the red giant branch stars , namely @xmath2=18.69@xmath10.25@xmath10.06  _ mag _ ( statistical plus systematic error ) . both values agree well with the distance to the sn  1987a as determined from a study of its inner ring fluorescent echo ( @xmath3=18.55@xmath10.05  _ mag _ , panagia 1998 ) , thus excluding distance moduli lower than 18.43 to a 99.7% significance level . </S>",
