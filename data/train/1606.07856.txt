    "the potential to realize interesting quantum spin liquid states with fractionalized excitations and topological order has driven research on frustrated magnets in the last decades.@xcite one of the most promising candidate models is the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the two - dimensional kagome lattice .",
    "many theoretical attempts have been made to unravel its groundstate properties , which are still not fully understood .",
    "while early approaches supported a symmetry broken valence bond solid state,@xcite various different groundstates have been proposed since .",
    "recent numerical works based on the density matrix renormailzation group ( dmrg ) method provide strong evidence for a gapped @xmath2 spin liquid state,@xcite whereas projected wavefunction studies favor a gapless @xmath3-dirac spin liquid groundstate,@xcite but this issue is not settled yet.@xcite both of these states do not break lattice symmetries and lack conventional long - range magnetic order due to strong quantum fluctuations associated with the frustrated spin - exchange interactions .",
    "the interest in chiral spin liquids , which break time - reversal and parity symmetries , was triggered by kalmeyer and laughlin , who proposed that bosonic analogues of fractional quantum hall states could be realized in frustrated magnets.@xcite within a slave - fermion approach these chiral states are stable phases of matter , because gauge fluctuations are gapped by a chern - simons term.@xcite more recently , various theoretical works showed that such chiral spin liquids can be stabilized on the kagome lattice either by including further - neighbor interactions or additional terms that explicitly break time - reversal symmetry.@xcite    as far as experiments are concerned , the mineral herbertsmithite as well as organic charge transfer salts are the most promising candidate materials to host a spin liquid groundstate.@xcite while measurements on the triangular lattice organic salts are consistent with a gapless spin liquid , the kagome lattice compound herbertsmithite likely has a gapped spin liquid groundstate .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments are compatible with a continuum of fractionalized spinon excitations,@xcite and recent nmr measurements indicate that the groundstate is gapped.@xcite the fact that no sharp onset of the two - spinon continuum was observed in neutron scattering has been attributed to the presence of a flat band of topological vison excitations in gapped @xmath2 spin liquids,@xcite as well as to the contribution from impurities at low energies.@xcite    various different spin liquid states have been proposed as potential groundstates of kagome heisenberg antiferromagnets . in order to relate theoretical results to inelastic neutron scattering experiments , a better characterization of dynamical structure factors in kagome systems is clearly beneficial . in this work",
    "we take a step in this direction by computing dynamical spin structure factors of simple chiral spin liquids using schwinger - boson mean - field theory.@xcite our approach is based on an earlier projective symmetry group classification of time - reversal symmetry breaking mean - field anstze by messio , lhuillier , and misguich.@xcite we show that the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath4 shows clear signatures of time - reversal symmetry breaking , in contrast to static ( equal - time ) structure factors . in particular , momentum inversion symmetry @xmath5 is lost and consequently the six - fold rotation symmetry of @xmath4 around the @xmath1-point is reduced to three - fold rotations .",
    "moreover , we show that the onset of the two - spinon continuum is rather flat for the _ cuboc1 _ state , which has been argued to minimize the groundstate energy of the kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet within the schwinger - boson approach.@xcite this particular chiral spin liquid state is a quantum disordered version of the magnetically ordered _ cuboc1 _ state , which is a possible non - coplanar state of the classical afkm model .",
    "@xcite    it is important to note that this schwinger - boson construction does not lead to chiral spin liquids of the kalmeyer - laughlin type .",
    "this is due to the fact that the condensation of boson bilinears reduces the gauge symmetry from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the effective low energy theory is a chern - simons - higgs theory with a condensed charge-2 higgs field , the topological properties of which are typically equivalent to @xmath2 gauge theory.@xcite    the remainder of our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : diag ] we review the schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) for time - reversal symmetry breaking anstze and calculate the spinon dispersions . in section  [ sec : self ]",
    "we determine the mean - field parameters self - consistently for all sbmft anstze considered in this work . in section  [ sec : ssf ] the spin structure factor for a general chiral sbmft ansatz is derived .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : results ] we present and discuss the numerically computed structure factors . we conclude with section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the spin operator on lattice site @xmath9 and the sum runs over nearest neighbor sites . in the following we use the schwinger - boson representation of spin operators @xmath10 where here , and throughout this paper",
    ", we employ a summation convention over repeated greek indices , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are bosonic annihilation and creation operators , respectively , of spin @xmath13 on site @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath14 where the langrange multiplier @xmath15 constrains the number of bosons per site to @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the length of the spin .",
    "note that this length constraint is only imposed on average here and in the following mean - field approximation .",
    "it can be enforced exactly by allowing for a space- and imaginary time dependent lagrange multiplier , which leads to a theory of bosonic spinons coupled to an emergent u(1 ) gauge field.@xcite however , for the spin liquid states considered in this work , the condensation of bosonic bilinears gaps out gauge fluctuations and the mean - field approximation is justified .",
    "we now introduce the @xmath18-invariant bond operators @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fully antisymmetric tensor of @xmath18 .",
