    "this article is dedicated to hans bethe .",
    "the work reported here has its connection to hans through a strange confluence of events .",
    "it has its origins in meteoritics , neutrino physics , and supernovae .",
    "hans and gerry brown had been pursuing theories of hypernovae and their inferences on this problem led them to extensive talks with us and greatly stimulated our efforts . their positive support of our exploration was a stimulating force in all of our work , even when possible direct connections disappeared .    the clear demonstration that the early solar system ( ess ) contained many radioactive nuclei with a short to intermediate lifetime required injection from various nucleosynthetic sources . amongst these nuclei was @xmath7i ( @xmath8 myr ) discovered by @xcite .",
    "this nuclide can not be produced by any slow ( `` @xmath3 '' ) neutron - capture process and requires very high neutron densities for its production .",
    "it was clearly to be associated with the `` @xmath0''-process as enunciated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "measurements of many samples of ess debris preserved in meteorites showed that the abundance of @xmath7i relative to that of stable @xmath9i was ( @xmath7i/@xmath9i)@xmath10 at the time of formation of the solar system . upon recognizing that this was most plausibly the result of long - term galactic nucleosynthesis , it followed that the time between the last addition of such @xmath0-process debris and the formation of the solar system had to be @xmath11  yr @xcite .",
    "this matter rested almost two decades until clear evidence was found for other short - lived nuclei in the ess [ see the recent review by @xcite ] .",
    "the various possible stellar nucleosynthetic sources required to produce this inventory of short - lived nuclei led to theoretical models of a wide variety .",
    "one possibility , for some of these nuclei , was a low - mass star during its asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage leading to the formation of a planetary nebula .",
    "this potential source had been extensively explored by @xcite and @xcite in studying the @xmath3-process that is known to take place in such sites . in a collaboration between the turino group and the junior author , where he was educated by his italian colleagues ,",
    "an agb model was explored and predictions made of the isotopic yields @xcite .",
    "these predictions included yields of @xmath12hf [ @xmath13 myr @xcite ] .",
    "it was shown that an agb source could only produce very little @xmath12hf .",
    "this nuclide was subsequently discovered to be also present in the ess @xcite .",
    "an agb source for this nuclide was excluded by the level of its abundance relative to stable @xmath14hf of ( @xmath12hf/@xmath14hf)@xmath15 .",
    "more recent measurements have now established a reliable value of ( @xmath12hf/@xmath14hf)@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , the difficulty for an agb source to account for the @xmath12hf in the ess is only slightly alleviated .",
    "the major problem persisted  this nuclide must be produced in an @xmath0-process and can not be made effectively in an @xmath3-process .",
    "this led to the following dilemma : both @xmath7i ( @xmath8 myr ) and @xmath12hf ( @xmath17 myr ) could not have been produced by the same @xmath0-process source ( @xmath0-source ) in order to account for their measured relative abundances in the ess .",
    "this results from the simple fact that there is a factor of 1.8 difference in their lifetimes .",
    "for example , consider a model of continuous nucleosynthesis over a galactic timescale @xmath18 yr with uniform ( number ) production rates @xmath19 for nuclide @xmath20 . in this case the interstellar medium ( ism ) would have an inventory of @xmath21 for a stable nucleus ( s ) and @xmath22 for a radioactive one ( r ) .",
    "if this uniform production is followed by a period of no production for a time @xmath23 prior to the formation of the solar system , then the abundance of r in the ess is diminished by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath7i we have @xmath25 if the ratio of the production rates is of order unity , then the above equation gives @xmath26   myr .",
    "for this @xmath23 and assuming @xmath27 , a similar equation for @xmath12hf would give ( @xmath12hf/@xmath14hf)@xmath28 , much smaller than the measured value of @xmath29 . as there is no basis for considering a large production ratio @xmath30 to make up for this gross difference , it follows that @xmath7i and @xmath12hf , both @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath0-nuclei ) , can not be produced in the same type of event .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this fact requires at least two types of @xmath0-process event and must be related to the differences between the site of production for the light @xmath0-nuclei with mass numbers @xmath31 and that for the heavy ones with @xmath1 .",
    "these authors also noted that elemental abundances in low - metallicity stars formed in the early galaxy would be highly susceptible to the particular type of @xmath0-source contaminating their birth medium .",
    "the study of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo , as was already being pursued by chris sneden and his colleagues , would clearly be of aid in testing this inference .",
    "such studies indeed prove to be of great importance in establishing the diversity of @xmath0-sources .    for almost forty years",
    "there had been a general preference for considering the @xmath0-process to be associated with a single type of astrophysical source that has an appropriate dynamic timescale .- process .",
    "some workers have studied the possibility that these events are the source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath1 [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "however , the problem is that these events are too infrequent ( by a factor of @xmath32 ) compared to core - collapse supernovae . if neutron star mergers were the source for heavy @xmath0-nuclei , then enrichment in these nuclei would not occur until the ism had already been substantially enriched in fe by fe core - collapse supernovae from progenitors of @xmath33@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction to the existence of stars with very low fe abundances but highly enriched in heavy @xmath0-nuclei ( see section  [ sec - fe - decoup ] ) .",
    "in addition , the observations so far show that high enrichments of heavy @xmath0-nuclei are always accompanied by enrichments of the nuclei with @xmath4110 at a roughly comparable level ( see sections  [ sec - cpr - h ] and [ sec - ycpr ] ) .",
    "however , it has not been demonstrated that the latter nuclei can be produced in neutron star mergers . for the above reasons",
    ", we will not discuss neutron star merger models for the @xmath0-process further .",
    "] the site usually discussed was an explosive environment such as some region inside a core - collapse supernova .",
    "the evolution and nucleosynthesis of massive stars associated with such supernovae is discussed in the book by @xcite and is reviewed in a recent paper by @xcite . following the seminal paper by @xcite on the neutrino - driven supernova mechanism , the material ejected by neutrino heating from the vicinity of a nascent neutron star  the neutrino - driven wind  was considered the most promising site for the @xmath0-process @xcite . for many workers in the field , the possibility of multiple @xmath0-sources was not readily accepted . although it was generally understood that a superposition of yield patterns each covering a different mass range is required to reproduce the overall solar @xmath0-process abundance pattern ( @xmath0-pattern ) in the absence of fission cycling [ e.g. , @xcite ] , it was preferred to consider this superposition as the result of mixing within a single astrophysical environment .",
    "for example , it was regarded as a major success when the model of @xcite appeared to produce an integrated yield pattern from a single supernova that closely resembles the solar @xmath0-pattern with peaks at @xmath35 and 195 .",
    "the compelling evidence obtained later from spectroscopic data of very high quality on several key halo stars of ultra - low metallicities has brought the issue of diverse @xmath0-sources to the forefront of theoretical consideration .",
    "when the @xmath7i and @xmath12hf dilemma appeared , the matter was a source of lunch - time discussions in the athenaeum at caltech with hans and gerry .",
    "it was also imposed on rose who has gracefully endured this type of `` social '' conversation for many years .",
    "hans , of course , on first hearing the dilemma would go on about the nuclear details of @xmath7i and @xmath12hf without any books  just from his incredible mind .",
    "awesome !",
    "the senior author was a research fellow in petr vogel s group at caltech around the time when the @xmath7i and @xmath12hf dilemma was first being discussed .",
    "he had just finished a detailed study on the neutrino - driven wind with stan woosley , which showed that the conditions in the wind fall short of what is required for an @xmath0-process @xcite .",
    "it did not appear that a straightforward ab initio solution to the @xmath0-process problem was within reach . on the other hand , a phenomenological approach based on the available observational data might offer some helpful guidance . the @xmath7i and @xmath12hf dilemma seemed to provide a good starting point for this approach . in an initial effort , @xcite proposed two types of supernova @xmath0-process event : the @xmath36 type producing mainly the heavy @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath1 and the @xmath37 type producing mainly the light ones with @xmath31 .",
    "the overall solar @xmath0-pattern was considered to have resulted from a mixture of these two types of event .",
    "the meteoritic data on @xmath7i and @xmath12hf could also be accounted for by requiring that the last event contributing @xmath0-nuclei to the solar system be of the @xmath36 type .",
    "based on later observations of abundances in metal - poor stars , the authors of this report developed a phenomenological model with more detailed description of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 events @xcite .",
    "this model makes quantitative predictions for elemental abundances that are in good agreement with the observations . in this report",
    ", we will present inferences that we drew from the earlier data and then show some changes that must follow from the newer high - quality observational results obtained by many groups .",
    "our basic conclusions reached earlier appear to remain valid .",

    ". neither sets of abundances have changed drastically in forty years ( except for fe ) although both have been regularly subject to revisions .",
    "there is a problem with attributing @xmath48 obtained by @xmath3-process subtraction for nuclei with @xmath4110 to the @xmath0-process .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec - wind ] .",
    "clearly , the solar inventory is the result of contributions from many stellar sources over galactic history . due to mixing of nucleosynthetic products from different sources in the ism over this long history ,",
    "the patterns for the gross abundances of a wide range of elements in other stars with approximately solar metallicity are observed to be close to the solar pattern .",
    "it is well recognized that this apparent `` universality '' does not imply the existence of a single process for making all the nuclei in nature . however , when only production by rapid neutron capture is considered , it is tempting to regard the solar @xmath0-pattern as a truly universal yield pattern of every single @xmath0-process event . theoretically speaking ,",
    "it is possible to reproduce the solar @xmath0-pattern with peaks at both @xmath35 and 195 ( see fig .  [ fig - rsun ] ) by fission cycling in a single environment with extremely abundant supply of neutrons [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "however , this would most likely couple the production of @xmath7i and @xmath12hf , in contradiction to the meteoritic data discussed in section  [ sec - intro ] .",
    "in addition , so far there is no self - consistent astrophysical model that can demonstrate the occurrence of fission cycling [ the model of @xcite is of parametric nature ] .",
    "there have also been studies aiming to reproduce the overall solar @xmath0-pattern from a single site without fission cycling [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "however , these studies are either parametric or unsuccessful [ the nonparametric model of @xcite has several serious deficiencies , see e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "an @xmath0-process requires an environment of high neutron ( number ) density with a large abundance of neutrons relative to the seed nuclei capturing them .",
    "the theory of the @xmath0-process has four components : ( 1 ) what are the seed nuclei and how are they provided ?",
    "( 2 ) how do temperature , density , and neutron abundance evolve with time during the @xmath0-process ?",
    "( 3 ) what are the properties of the nuclei participating in the @xmath0-process and the rates of the relevant reactions ? ( 4 ) how many types of astrophysical sources with distinct @xmath0-process yield ( @xmath0-yield ) patterns are there to account for the chemical evolution of @xmath0-nuclei in the galaxy and elsewhere ?",
    "the third component is in the domain of nuclear physics and is crucial to the determination of the exact @xmath0-yield pattern produced by a specific astrophysical source .",
    "we will not discuss this component here .",
    "instead , we address some aspects of the first and second components and focus on the fourth considering observations of metal - poor stars and data on the solar system .",
    "nearly all @xmath0-process models are of parametric nature and fall into two categories : one is self - contained in that the first and second components listed above are addressed within the model [ e.g. , @xcite ] , while the other assumes a seed nucleus and subjects it to neutron bombardment at constant neutron density and temperature for some time [ e.g. , @xcite ] . in the absence of fission cycling , both categories of models require a superposition of @xmath0-yield patterns produced under different conditions to reproduce the overall solar @xmath0-pattern , but neither can determine whether this superposition is achieved by combining the @xmath0-nuclei produced in different regions at different times within a single astrophysical source or by mixing the @xmath0-nuclei produced by different types of source in the ism .",
    "the requirement of superposition to reproduce the solar @xmath0-pattern without fission cycling can be understood from the following simplified description of the @xmath0-process .",
    "consider an @xmath0-process starting with a ratio @xmath49 of the total number of free neutrons to that of the seed nuclei .",
    "as all the neutrons will be captured , the equation governing this @xmath0-process is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average mass number of the seed nuclei and @xmath52 that of the final @xmath0-nuclei produced .",
    "it follows that for @xmath53 , @xmath54 is required to produce an abundance peak at @xmath35 . from the same seed distribution , to produce an abundance peak at @xmath55 would require @xmath56 .",
    "it is immediately evident that the solar @xmath0-pattern with peaks at both @xmath35 and 195 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - rsun ] ) can only be reproduced by a superposition of @xmath0-yield patterns corresponding to a range of @xmath49 . for illustration , we assume that a single kind of seed nucleus with mass number @xmath57 is present at time @xmath58 and that the @xmath0-process subsequently passes through a fixed set of nuclei . we show the progress of the @xmath0-process for different @xmath49 values in figure  [ fig - rfo ] . for @xmath59 all the neutrons have been captured by @xmath60  s , resulting in an @xmath0-yield pattern dominated by the peak at @xmath35 ( panel labeled `` @xmath60  s '' ) . by comparison , for a higher @xmath61",
    "many neutrons remain to be captured at @xmath60  s and rapid neutron capture continues until @xmath62  s , leading to major production of the nuclei in the peak at @xmath55 and beyond ( panel labeled `` @xmath62  s '' ) .",
    "the solar @xmath0-pattern with peaks at both @xmath35 and 195 can then be reproduced , for example , by an appropriate superposition of the @xmath0-yield patterns for @xmath59 and 86 @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that a single kind of seed nucleus with @xmath57 is present at @xmath58 and that the @xmath0-process passes through a fixed set of nuclei .",
    "rapid neutron capture stops at @xmath60  s for @xmath59 and at @xmath62  s for @xmath61 .",
    "the panels labeled by these times give the yield patterns for these two @xmath49 values .",
    "other panels represent intermediate stages before all neutrons are captured . ]    to summarize , the solar @xmath0-pattern represents a superposition of @xmath0-yield patterns produced with a range of @xmath49 ( some variation in the seed nuclei is also possible ) in the absence of fission cycling .",
    "meteoritic data on @xmath7i and @xmath12hf suggest that this superposition was accomplished by mixing the @xmath0-nuclei produced by two distinct types of source in the ism : one has high @xmath49 and produces mainly the heavy @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath1 while the other has lower @xmath49 and produces mainly the light @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath31 .",
    "the issue of two distinct @xmath0-sources will be discussed further in section  [ sec - obs ] in connection with observations of metal - poor stars . as mentioned above",
    ", it is possible to produce simultaneously the peaks at both @xmath35 and 195 in the solar @xmath0-pattern with fission cycling . in this case , the average mass number @xmath52 of the nuclei produced is determined by the @xmath0-process flow between the fission fragments and the nuclei undergoing fission .",
    "the total abundance of the nuclei produced is essentially governed by the available neutron supply .",
    "clearly , equation  ( [ eq - n / s ] ) does not apply to the case of fission cycling as the mass numbers of the seed nuclei are no longer pertinent .",
    "the possible role of fission cycling in @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis will be discussed in section  [ sec - song ] .",
    "we now turn to a class of astrophysical models for heavy element synthesis that may be closely related to the @xmath0-process .",
    "the formation of a neutron star in a core - collapse supernova results in the emission of intense flux of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as the neutron star releases its enormous gravitational binding energy of several @xmath69  erg during the first @xmath70  s of its life . as @xmath63 and @xmath64 pass through the `` atmosphere '' of free neutrons and protons surrounding the neutron star , some of them are captured via the reactions @xmath71 the heating of the atmosphere mainly by the above reactions makes it expand , thereby forming a neutrino - driven wind from the neutron star .",
    "the heating occurs mostly within a few neutron star radii and becomes inefficient at larger distance due to the decrease in the neutrino flux and the increase in the wind velocity .",
    "therefore , the wind material expands approximately adiabatically above several neutron star radii . the profuse production of neutrons via the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq - nuebarp ] ) in the vicinity of the neutron star , although countered by destruction via the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq - nuen ] ) , suggests the possibility that the neutrino - driven wind may be associated with the @xmath0-process .",
    "the adiabatic expansion of a mass element in the wind is governed by three key parameters : the entropy @xmath72 , the dynamic timescale @xmath73 , and the electron fraction @xmath74 .",
    "the electron fraction specifies the initial number fractions of free neutrons and protons as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , when the mass element is near the neutron star .",
    "the dynamic timescale @xmath73 controls how fast the temperature decreases as the element expands , and @xmath72 determines the density at a given temperature .",
    "these parameters are determined in turn by the state of the neutron star that is defined by its mass @xmath77 and radius @xmath78 as well as its neutrino emission characteristics when the mass element is ejected [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the amount of material ejected with a specific set of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 depends on how long the neutron star stays in the corresponding state . during the period of interest",
    ", @xmath77 remains essentially constant but @xmath78 decreases substantially , the neutrino luminosity decreases drastically , and the neutrino energy spectra can change substantially . in any case ,",
    "given the evolution of @xmath78 and the neutrino emission characteristics of a neutron star , one can calculate the amounts of material ejected with various sets of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 during this evolution . for a mass element with a specific set of these parameters , nuclear reactions during its expansion",
    "produce a particular set of heavy nuclei with specific abundances .",
    "the total production of heavy nuclei in the neutrino - driven wind is then an integral over the evolution of the neutron star .",
    "we now consider some examples of nucleosynthesis associated with the expansion of a mass element in the wind from a neutron star with @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution of the radius and neutrino emission characteristics of this neutron star is taken from @xcite .",
    "consider the epoch for which @xmath80  km and the neutrino energy spectra change slowly .",
    "it is convenient to use the neutrino luminosity @xmath81 as a function of time @xmath82 to represent the evolution of the neutron star during this epoch . at a given time , a mass element is ejected and processed as it moves outward until all nuclear reactions cease . at a later time , another element is ejected and moves outward being processed at a different neutrino luminosity until all nuclear reactions cease .",
    "there are two timescales involved : the dynamic timescale @xmath73 for a mass element to move out and the evolutionary timescale @xmath83 over which @xmath84 changes significantly .",
    "typically we have @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the conditions and the resulting nucleosynthesis would be similar for mass elements ejected within an interval @xmath86 .",
    "we pick two times @xmath87 and @xmath88 during the evolution of the above neutron star . for @xmath89  erg",
    "/ s per species , the mass element is ejected with @xmath90 ( in units of boltzmann constant per baryon ) , @xmath91  s , and @xmath92 ; for @xmath93  erg / s per species , the conditions change to @xmath94 , @xmath95  s , and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the difference in @xmath73 is mainly due to the factor of 3 difference in @xmath84 while that in @xmath74 mostly results from the change in the neutrino energy spectra . for the mass element ejected at @xmath87 , nucleosynthesis predominantly produces @xmath97sr , @xmath98y , and @xmath99zr [ see fig .  1 in @xcite ] .",
    "for the mass element ejected at @xmath88 , the dominant products are @xmath100zr , @xmath101mo , @xmath102ru , @xmath103pd , and @xmath104ag [ see fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath104ag was made as @xmath104mo , which decays through @xmath104pd with @xmath105  myr , see @xcite ] .",
    "however , for both cases the heavy nuclei are produced by the so - called @xmath106-process involving charged - particle reactions @xcite , not by rapid neutron capture .",
    "in fact , by the time charged - particle reactions cease due to the prohibitive coulomb barrier at a temperature @xmath1073@xmath108  k , few neutrons are left for each heavy nucleus so that no significant processing by rapid neutron capture can occur subsequently @xcite .",
    "the above results are representative of nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven wind from a @xmath109 neutron star .",
    "while nuclei with @xmath4110 can be produced by the @xmath106-process , there are too few neutrons left at the end of the @xmath106-process to drive a subsequent @xmath0-process .",
    "as the higher neutrino luminosity @xmath110 is more efficient in ejecting the material than the lower @xmath111 , the total production integrated over the evolution of the neutron star is dominated by @xmath97sr , @xmath98y , and @xmath99zr @xcite .",
    "if we consider a more massive neutron star with @xmath112 , the production at earlier times during its evolution is similar to the @xmath109 case . however , the wind has significantly higher @xmath72 at later times .",
    "for example , the neutron star state with @xmath80  km and @xmath113 per species corresponds to @xmath114 , @xmath115  s , and @xmath116 @xcite . for these parameters ,",
    "the @xmath106-process dominantly produces @xmath117mo , @xmath118ru , @xmath119rh , @xmath120pd , @xmath121ag , and @xmath122cd . in addition , a significant part of the nuclear flow has reached @xmath123125 , signaling an incipient @xmath0-process [ see fig .",
    "6 in @xcite ] .",
    "however , even in this case there are also only @xmath124 neutrons available for each heavy nucleus produced by the @xmath106-process .",
    "one caveat for the @xmath125 neutron star case is that there is no self - consistent calculation of either its neutrino emission characteristics or the evolution of its radius . in the above example",
    ", we have simply assumed @xmath80  km and taken the neutrino energy spectra corresponding to @xmath113 per species for the @xmath109 case .",
    "many studies of the @xmath0-process [ see the recent review by @xcite ] are of this parametric nature and thus lack self - consistency",
    ". it may be quite possible that a self - consistent calculation of the evolution of a @xmath125 neutron star may give rise to an @xmath0-process producing nuclei with @xmath35 during some part of its evolution .",
    "for production of @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath55 , there must be @xmath126 neutrons left for each heavy nucleus produced when the @xmath106-process ceases at @xmath1073@xmath108  k. this requires much more extreme conditions in either entropy or dynamic timescale as shown in figure  [ fig - syetau ] .",
    "given the typical conditions of @xmath127 , @xmath1280.1  s , and @xmath129 in the neutrino - driven wind [ e.g. , @xcite ] , it appears that there is no clear case for sufficient neutrons to produce @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath55 in the wind .",
    "we here consider that the neutrino - driven wind is not directly responsible for the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath1 .    , @xmath74 , and @xmath73 required to produce @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath55 in an adiabatically expanding mass element such as that in the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "three choices of @xmath73 are shown [ see @xcite for discussion and more results ] .",
    "note that for @xmath127 and @xmath129 typical of the neutrino - driven wind , the high @xmath49 required for production of @xmath0-nuclei with @xmath55 can only be obtained with very short dynamic timescales @xmath130  s. however , typical values for the wind are @xmath1280.1  s [ e.g. , @xcite ] . ]",
    "insofar as the neutrino - driven wind model is basically correct , then the need for a bridge between the @xmath106-process in the wind and the real @xmath0-process remains the key issue .",
    "there is some confusion in the literature with regard to the `` light @xmath0-nuclei '' with @xmath4110 . insofar as they mostly represent the products of the @xmath106-process involving charged - particle reactions that would precede any true @xmath0-process , they should not be considered or lumped with the true @xmath0-nuclei produced by rapid neutron capture .",
    "we will henceforth refer to the nuclei with @xmath4110 produced by charged - particle reactions ( the @xmath106-process ) in the neutrino - driven wind as `` cpr '' nuclei .",

    "other workers have proposed a low - mass core - collapse sn source for the @xmath0-process based on considerations of galactic evolution of eu with fe [ e.g. , @xcite ] or parametric models of the @xmath0-process [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "these considerations and models are not related to the critical and definitive observations and arguments laid out in the preceding subsections .",
    "the arguments outlined here [ see also @xcite ] are based on the observed decoupling of the production of heavy @xmath0-nuclei from that of the elements above n through the fe group as well as the relationship between heavy @xmath0-nuclei and cpr elements .",
    "one might argue that fe core - collapse sne with progenitors of @xmath189 may not eject the elements above n through the fe group due to `` fallback '' [ e.g. , @xcite ] , and therefore could be a source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "there are two problems with this argument .",
    "first , unlike the elements from si to the fe group , which are produced by explosive burning in the inner shells and therefore most susceptible to fallback for progenitors of @xmath189 , the elements o , na , mg , and al are produced by hydrostatic burning in the outer shells during pre - sn evolution and will not be as easily eliminated by fallback [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "further , the heavy @xmath0-nuclei are usually considered to be made in the inner most part of an sn .",
    "were they made in fe core - collapse sne with progenitors of @xmath189 , it is very difficult to see how they can survive the fallback that prevents the ejection of those elements produced in the outer regions .",
    "it follows that low - mass core - collapse sne and aic events are the only possible sources for heavy @xmath0-nuclei . in reaching this conclusion ,",
    "we have assumed that stars of @xmath139@xmath178 would lead to low - mass core - collapse sne that do not produce the elements of the fe group or those of intermediate mass above n. investigations by several groups indicate that the evolution of stars in this narrow mass interval depends on the initial metallicity and is especially sensitive to the treatment of convection and convective overshoot @xcite . in particular , the exact mass range resulting in o - ne - mg core - collapse sne is rather uncertain .",
    "for example , @xcite found that for solar metallicity , only stars of @xmath178 lead to o - ne - mg core - collapse sne while those of 9 , 10 , and @xmath190 become o - ne - mg white dwarfs after ejecting their h envelope [ see @xcite ] .",
    "this is in conflict with the results shown in figures  [ fig - fe - core ] and [ fig - onemg - core ] . because stars of @xmath139@xmath178 play such important roles in understanding the sources for heavy @xmath0-nuclei , it is highly desirable that further work be pursued to follow the evolution of these stars starting from the main sequence and considering the effects of the initial metallicity and mass loss .",
    "the aic scenario discussed in the preceding subsection may have a rather complicated history of mass transfer between the primary intermediate - mass star of @xmath187@xmath188 and its low - mass companion .",
    "the companion may accrete material from the primary star during the red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb stages of the latter , thus acquiring typical products of rgb and agb evolution , in particular the @xmath3-process nuclei ( @xmath3-nuclei ) .",
    "the primary star would eventually eject its envelope and become a white dwarf .",
    "if this white dwarf were then to accrete sufficient material from the expanded low - mass companion , it could collapse into a neutron star .",
    "while no elements above n through the fe group would be produced in this aic event , cpr elements would be made in the neutrino - driven wind from the neutron star .",
    "if heavy @xmath0-nuclei could also be made in this event , then the low - mass companion would acquire these nuclei as well as the cpr elements through contamination of its surface by the ejecta containing such products . in this scenario , a low - mass star in a binary system may become highly enriched first with agb products including c , n , and @xmath3-nuclei and then with cpr elements and heavy @xmath0-nuclei @xcite .",

    "calculations that just use the neutrons from this source may give significantly different @xmath3-yield patterns from those produced with the standard @xmath193c pocket .",
    "@xcite recently reported for the first time the detection of os and ir in cs  31062050 , a star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath191 but with high @xmath207 enrichments [ see also @xcite ] .",

    "os , and ir , @xcite assumed that these @xmath0-enrichments were inherited by the star from the ism ( see discussion in the two preceding paragraphs ) .",
    "the highly enhanced pb in cs  31062050 again clearly shows the presence of an @xmath3-component produced by a low - metallicity agb star as predicted by @xcite .",

    "studies of the @xmath3-process in low - metallicity intermediate - mass stars of @xmath187@xmath188 must be undertaken in order to better understand the problem at hand .",

    "taking the radius of this star to be @xmath295 and the distance from its binary companion to be @xmath296 when the companion underwent aic or o - ne - mg core collapse to produce the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , we estimate that a fraction @xmath297 of the @xmath0-process ejecta would be intercepted by he  21481247 . the resulting eu enrichment would be @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the mass fraction of h and @xmath300 is the dilution mass for the intercepted material . using @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 @xcite , we obtain @xmath305 from the above equation .",
    "this appears reasonable and would be consistent with the observational indication that he  21481247 is now in a long - period binary system @xcite if its orbit was widened greatly following the aic or o - ne - mg core - collapse event due to , e.g. , the kick imparted to the neutron star remnant . in either case , there should be a common - envelope phase during the rgb and agb evolution of the original primary star .    finally , we note that the production of cpr nuclei and heavy @xmath0-nuclei by @xmath36 events may make important contributions to the inventory of some radioactive nuclei in the ess . as @xmath12hf is exclusively made in @xmath36 events and its inventory in the ess is measured , we first discuss @xmath12hf .",
    "consider the simple model where uniform production of @xmath12hf had lasted for a period @xmath306 and was then followed by an interval @xmath307 of no production prior to the formation of the solar system ( see section  [ sec - intro ] ) .",
    "this would result in @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the part of @xmath310 in the solar system contributed by the @xmath0-process .",
    "using @xmath311 [ @xcite ] , @xmath312 @xcite , and @xmath313  myr , we obtain @xmath314  myr for @xmath315  gyr .    as mentioned in section  [ sec - wind ]",
    ", the neutrino - driven wind makes @xmath104mo , which decays through @xmath104pd producing @xmath104ag .",
    "the model for production of @xmath316 by @xmath36 events discussed above gives @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the ( number ) production ratio of @xmath104pd to @xmath12hf for @xmath36 events and can be estimated as @xmath319 ( the factor of 1/2 is used as ag has an additional isotope @xmath320ag ) .",
    "taking @xmath321 ( see table  [ tab - hl ] ) , @xmath322 @xcite , and @xmath105  myr , we obtain @xmath323 .",
    "this gives @xmath324 where @xmath325 @xcite is used .",
    "the above result is close to the measured value of @xmath326 [ @xcite , see also the recent review by @xcite ] . note that although @xmath37 events also produce @xmath104pd , their contributions to the @xmath104pd in the ess are negligible as the interval between the last @xmath37 contributions and the formation of the solar system is @xmath327  myr based on the @xmath7i data ( see section  [ sec - intro ] ) .",
    "therefore , it appears that the @xmath36 events were responsible for both @xmath104pd and @xmath12hf in the ess .",
    "this eliminates the conflict with the data on @xmath7i , which is not produced by the @xmath36 events .",
    "however , the broader problems and conflicts regarding @xmath328mn , @xmath329fe , and @xmath330 cm would not be resolved [ see the recent review by @xcite ] .      in the lego - block model presented here",
    "we have restricted our analysis to a regime where neither low - mass agb stars nor sne ia had contributed significant material to the ism .",
    "the model claims to predict the abundances of all the other elements for any star ( without experiencing @xmath3-process contamination ) in this regime given the eu and fe abundances of the star .",
    "it does not seek to provide a detailed or global study of gce .",
    "models of gce require assumptions on the rates of formation for a wide range of stellar sources , their yields , and the amount of dilution by mixing with the ism over time .",
    "many of these models successfully demonstrate general trends over most of galactic history [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "some models describe the stochastic process of enrichments and can provide a statistical description of abundances in stars [ e.g. , @xcite ] . to our knowledge ,",
    "no gce models are capable of predicting the abundances of all the other elements in an individual star from its eu and fe abundances .",
    "we are still open to wagers on the predictions of our lego - block model .",
    "the authors thank hans for many stimulating and illuminating conversations and for being supportive of a strange new approach to the science at hand .",
    "we thank alex heger and ken nomoto for educating us on presupernova evolution and for providing us with figures  [ fig - fe - core ] and [ fig - onemg - core ] , respectively , john lattanzio for pointing us to literature on agb stars , and judy cohen and wako aoki for permitting us to use figures  [ fig - baeu - rs ] and [ fig - aoki - rs ] , respectively , from their published works .",
    "we also thank marc kamionkowski for his patience with our unsuccessful efforts in writing a more extensive article with cosmic views on the subject and ask for his forgiveness .",
    "hopefully , this contribution covers much of what we were to write .",

    "now the question remains , how did the key for a room at the radisson hotel in denver open another room at the radisson hotel in minneapolis ? did the master key to all radisson hotel rooms happen to fall into the personal possession of g.j.w . ?",
