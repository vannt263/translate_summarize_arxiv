    "orbital electron capture by an atomic nucleus ( ec ) is one of basic nuclear transitions governed by weak interactions @xcite .",
    "although known and investigated for a very long , it is still a subject of interest in the various fields of fundamental research .",
    "examples include neutrino - less double - ec decay @xcite , search for sterile neutrinos @xcite and testing the lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect of ec decay , not yet fully explored , is the coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom , as shown in the decay of highly charged ions @xcite or in the searched nuclear excitations by electron capture @xcite . here",
    ", we address one such peculiar phenomenon where to account for radiation emitted during the ec decay , both the electronic and nuclear contributions have to be summed coherently .",
    "in addition , each contribution depends on the electromagnetic gauge , and in the so - called length gauge employed here , the nuclear radiation is suppressed .    according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "the evolution of a physical system can be described as proceeding through all possible paths , including those which may temporarily violate the law of energy conservation .",
    "the occurrence of such special paths , involving virtual intermediate states , becomes important ( and may be observable ) when all other possibilities are not allowed or are highly forbidden .",
    "an example of such a situation is the nuclear beta decay in which the direct transition between the initial and the final state is strongly hindered due to angular momentum and/or parity selection rules , while no other decay channels are present within the available energy window .",
    "then , as noted already long ago by longmire @xcite , an alternative decay path may involve a state in the daughter nucleus having energy higher than the initial state .",
    "if beta transition to such a state is allowed , a combination of this transition with emission of a gamma - ray may compete with the direct decay . rose , perrin , and foldy discussed such a virtual beta - gamma emission in more detail and noted that @xmath0ni is a promising candidate to observe this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0ni decays to the ground state of @xmath0co with the half - life of @xmath1  y @xcite , predominantly by electron capture with a tiny contribution of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the direct transition between these two states involves the change of spin by two units and no change of parity , thus it is classified as a second forbidden non - unique ( _ 2nu _ ) transition @xcite .",
    "however , in @xmath0co there exists a state located about 26  kev above the ground state of @xmath0ni , offering the possibility of the virtual `` detour '' transition by a combination of allowed ( fermi+gamow - teller ) electron capture , followed by e2 gamma emission .",
    "both decay paths and the current knowledge on the involved states are shown in figure 1 . the direct _",
    "2nu _ transition may also proceed with the emission of a photon .",
    "such a second - order , radiative electron capture ( rec ) occurs with the probability of about @xmath3 with respect to the ordinary , non - radiative capture .",
    "the dominant source of this radiation is the internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) of the captured electron @xcite .",
    "the rec energy spectrum is continuous , because of energy sharing between three bodies in the final state .",
    "the maximum photon energy equals the decay energy @xmath4 minus the binding energy of the captured electron in the daughter atom . in case of the k - capture in @xmath0ni ,",
    "the rec spectrum extends up to @xmath5  kev .",
    "the virtual `` detour '' transitions were predicted to modify the rec spectrum , mainly at the high energy end @xcite",
    ". the more extended calculation of this process , including interference effects , was done by lassila @xcite .",
    "( color online ) decay scheme of @xmath0ni and relevant states in @xmath0co @xcite .",
    "the energy levels are labeled by energy in kev , relative to the ground state of @xmath0co and by spin and parity values .",
    "the direct decay of @xmath0ni proceeds by second forbidden non - unique electron capture to the ground state of @xmath0co ( solid arrow ) .",
    "the virtual `` detour '' transition goes by allowed ( fermi and gamow - teller ) electron capture to the excited state of @xmath0co combined with gamma e2 deexcitation ( dashed arrows ) . ]",
    "the rec of @xmath0ni has already been studied several times . except for the very first attempt @xcite ,",
    "all later experiments were motivated by the search for the virtual beta - gamma transitions @xcite . only ref .",
    "@xcite claimed an observation of these transitions .",
    "however , as we argue below , results of these papers could not have been conclusive because the applied model of the rec process was either inaccurate or erroneous .",
    "we note in addition , that the virtual transitions were also considered for the case of @xmath6 decay @xcite .",
    "an important motivation of ref .",
    "@xcite was the precise calculation of possible background events for the low - energy neutrino detector based on @xmath7 in .",
    "draxler et al . reported an indirect evidence for the `` detour '' transitions in the @xmath6 decay of @xmath8y , obtained by a polarization measurement @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", the virtual beta - gamma transitions have never been observed in a direct and unambiguous way .    in this paper",
    "we present a clear evidence for the beta - gamma virtual transition in the gamma spectrum of @xmath0ni .",
    "we start by introducing the correct theory of the rec in case of _",
    "2nu _ forbidden transitions .",
    "then , we employ this theory to reanalyze experimental results published by janas et al . @xcite . the difference between theoretical predictions for the direct _",
    "2nu _ transition and the data is interpreted as coming from the virtual transition through the excited state in @xmath0co .",
    "furthermore , we present the first complete theoretical description of the gamma spectrum for the specific case of @xmath0ni which includes the rec part , the `` detour '' contribution as well as the interference between these two channels .",
    "any search for the virtual transitions in ec decays requires good understanding of the radiative capture , and this has a long history completed only recently . the first approximation , ignoring the coulomb field of the nucleus and relativistic effects , valid only for the k - capture ,",
    "was provided by morrison and schiff in 1940 @xcite .",
    "the model was greatly advanced by glauber and martin @xcite who described exactly the electron propagation in the coulomb field , included relativistic and screening effects , and considered captures from higher shells .",
    "this model was found to be in good agreement with a large number of experiments @xcite . nevertheless , it is valid only for allowed decays ( spin change @xmath9 , no parity change ) .",
    "the extension of the rec theory to any order of forbiddenness , with inclusion of coulomb and relativistic corrections , was done by zon and rapoport @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the rec spectra for first - forbidden unique ( _ 1u _ , @xmath10 , parity changes ) k - captures in @xmath11ca and @xmath12tl revealed strong discrepancies with their model @xcite , indicating that some approximations assumed by them are not valid .",
    "the _ 1u _ decay is special as the probability ratio of radiative to non - radiative electron capture does not depend on nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the experiment delivers the absolute value of this ratio as a function of the photon energy , which is compared without any normalization to the theoretical prediction which does not have any adjustable parameters .",
    "kalinowski et al .",
    "@xcite made an attempt to extend the zon and rapoport model by adding the `` detour '' transitions via virtual nuclear states following ideas of ford and martin @xcite , but repeated the same invalid approximations as zon and rapoport .",
    "he was able to reproduce the spectrum of @xmath11ca at the cost of adding a phenomenological parameter @xcite , but his model failed in case of @xmath12tl @xcite .",
    "finally , this conundrum was resolved by pachucki et al .",
    "@xcite with a crucial insight that the description of the electromagnetic radiation in this case is much more advantageous in the _ length _ gauge in contrast to the coulomb gauge used in all previous calculations .",
    "it allowed to expose and to circumvent divergent terms which were the source of wrong approximations in the model of zon and rapoport for the @xmath10 transitions .",
    "the problem was caused by neglecting the radiation from the nucleus which is not justified in the coulomb gauge .",
    "length_-gauge model , while reproducing exactly the results of glauber and martin for allowed decays , was found to describe very well both the shape and the intensity of experimental spectra of @xmath11ca and @xmath12tl @xcite and later also the spectrum of _ 1u _ k - capture in @xmath13kr @xcite .",
    "it is because the nuclear radiation is strongly suppressed in this gauge and can be neglected .",
    "following the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we extend the _",
    "length_-gauge model of rec to the _ 2nu _ transitions ( @xmath10 , no parity change ) .",
    "conventionally , the emission probability of a photon with energy @xmath14 per ordinary non - radiative electron capture and per unit energy is expressed in the form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fine structure constant , @xmath17 is the electron mass , @xmath18 is the maximal photon energy , and the units @xmath19 are used .",
    "details of the spectrum are thus represented by the dimensionless shape factor @xmath20 .",
    "we note that in the simplest approximation of morrison and schiff @xmath21 @xcite . for _ 2nu _ k - capture , the _",
    "length_-gauge model leads to : @xmath22 where the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which incorporate all coulomb and relativistic corrections , are derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the spectrum depends on the parameter @xmath25 which is a combination of nuclear matrix elements relevant for the direct transition between the initial and the final state : @xmath26 with @xmath27   \\| j_i \\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the atomic number of the initial atom , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the initial , and the final state , respectively and @xmath31 is a spherical tensor operator .",
    "eq.(2 ) was derived under the approximation @xmath32 and essentially represents the photons emitted by the electron in the ib process .",
    "the nuclear contribution is strongly suppressed in this model but _ only _ when there are no close - lying excited states in the daughter or in the parent nucleus @xcite .",
    "we note that for @xmath33 we obtain the shape factor for the k - capture in _",
    "1u _ transition , which reproduced so well the experimental data @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shape factor @xmath34 , eq.(2 - 4 ) , has the same form as in the model of zon and rapoport @xcite  the important difference is in the formula for the function @xmath24 which represents electronic transitions through @xmath35 and @xmath36 intermediate states .",
    "these transitions enter the description of rec for nuclear decays with @xmath10 .",
    "the values of this function in our model , and also of its coulomb - free limit , differ significantly from the prediction of zon and rapoport @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason why all previous attempts to identify virtual transitions in the decay of @xmath0ni , which used either the wrong rec model or its inaccurate coulomb - free approximation , could not have been successful .",
    "to test the new rec prediction for _ 2nu _ decays , we compare it to experimental data published for @xmath0ni @xcite .",
    "the k - capture component of the rec spectrum was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by recording gamma rays in coincidence with the kx - rays of cobalt .",
    "the shape factors extracted from two independent measurements , using different detection set - ups , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the differences between two data sets reflect inaccuracies of experimental procedures which involved various corrections , the largest being for the compton scattering and for the absolute efficiency of gamma detectors .",
    "the prediction of the model is given by eq.(2 ) where the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 were calculated numerically for the case of @xmath0ni .",
    "since it is difficult to calculate the value of @xmath25 , it is treated as a free parameter of the model .",
    "we found that no value of this parameter can reproduce both the shape and the intensity of the measured shape factor .",
    "however , we can adjust this parameter to fit the low - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the least squares method for the points from both data sets with @xmath37  kev , yields @xmath38 and the resulting shape factor is shown in figure 2 by the dashed line .",
    "( color online ) the radiative k - capture shape factor for @xmath0ni .",
    "experimental points are from ref .",
    "the dashed line represents the rec prediction , eq.(2 ) , for the value of the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the solid line shows the best fitted full model , including the virtual `` detour '' transitions and the interference term . ]    in figure 2 we see that while the spectrum is well reproduced by the rec model below 600  kev , the experimental intensity increases with energy above the rec prediction , exactly as expected in the early papers of rose et al .",
    "@xcite and lassila @xcite .",
    "we interpret this excess of radiation at the high - energy end as the evidence for the virtual beta - gamma transition through the excited @xmath40 level in @xmath0co .",
    "to verify this hypothesis , we calculate the spectrum of photons emitted in the process of virtual transition , marked in figure 1 by dashed arrows , using the _ length_-gauge approach . as the result",
    ", two additional terms have to be added to the shape factor : @xmath41 where the contribution from the virtual transition is given by : @xmath42 and the interference term reads : @xmath43 @xmath44 is the excitation energy of the @xmath40 level in @xmath0co , @xmath45 is the nuclear radius , and @xmath46 is expressed in terms of functions defined in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath47 the additional nuclear matrix elements which enter the model refer to the electromagnetic e2 transition and to fermi and gamow - teller beta transitions : @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the intermediate @xmath40 state .    the formulas above may be simplified in the case of @xmath0ni by noting that the matrix element for the fermi transition is negligible . the fermi transition in question",
    "can proceed only due to admixtures of the @xmath50 level , being the isospin analog of the @xmath40 state in @xmath0co , to the ground state of @xmath0ni .",
    "this analog level is located in @xmath0ni at about 8.4  mev excitation energy @xcite , which makes the isospin admixtures very small .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can expect the fermi matrix element to be of the order of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we put @xmath52 and we see that the both new terms ( eqs .",
    "6,7 ) depend on the single additional combination of nuclear matrix elements : @xmath53 where the compton wavelength of the electron , @xmath54  fm , is inserted to ensure that the @xmath55 is dimensionless .",
    "now , treating the @xmath25 and @xmath55 as free parameters we fit both data sets in the full energy range .",
    "the least - squares minimum is reached for the values : @xmath56 and for the positive interference sign .",
    "the result , shown in figure 2 with the solid line , reproduces the shape factor very well .",
    "the value of @xmath25 best fitting the full spectrum is almost equal to the value determined from the analysis of the low - energy part with the pure rec model .",
    "this validates our assumption that the virtual contribution does not affect the spectrum at low energy .",
    "figure 3 shows the contour plot of the least - squares function . due to its rather flat minimum ,",
    "the values of both parameters can not be extracted precisely .",
    "the resulting total gamma emission probability , given by integration of eq.(1 ) for @xmath57  kev , according to prediction , is @xmath58 .",
    "the integrated virtual and interference components represent 2% and 2.3% of this intensity , respectively .",
    "all matrix elements entering this analysis can be estimated from available experimental information .",
    "first , we note that the value of @xmath25 can be determined from the @xmath59 ratio for the decay of @xmath0ni .",
    "this ratio was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and yielded the value @xmath60 which agrees within @xmath61 with the value determined in the present analysis . from the half - life of @xmath0ni , using the k - capture rate formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we determine that @xmath62 fm .",
    "the @xmath40 level in @xmath0co at 1099.3 kev has a half - life of @xmath63  ps @xcite . from this value",
    "the e2 transition matrix element can be calculated yielding @xmath64  @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 element can be estimated from the systematics of the reduced half - life values , @xmath67 , for the gamow - teller transitions in the region of @xmath68ni @xcite .",
    "the measured values suggest that in our case @xmath69 is a reasonable assumption . using this value and the relation @xcite : @xmath70 we arrive at @xmath71 . inserting these values in eq.(10 )",
    "leads to @xmath72 which agrees well with the value determined from the spectrum of @xmath0ni .    in principle , all these matrix elements can be calculated within the nuclear structure theory .",
    "this challenging task remains outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we note , however , that those nuclear models which offer precise predictions of spectroscopic quality , like the shell - model , usually employ effective or empirical nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the theoretical results derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and here , based on elementary quantum electrodynamics and weak interaction theory , do not involve any such phenomenological ingredients .",
    "thus , the combinations of matrix elements , @xmath25 and @xmath55 , which can be measured with higher precision in the future , in fact can be used to constrain models of nuclear structure .",
    "( color online ) the contour map of the minimizing function .",
    "the dot shows the position of the minimum . ]",
    "the electromagnetic radiation accompanying the nuclear ec decay has two components : the electronic and the nuclear .",
    "the absolute discrimination between them is meaningless as their relative contribution depends on the adopted gauge of the electromagnetic field .",
    "recently , a long - standing puzzle of rec in _ 1u _ transitions was resolved by a new theoretical method which utilized the _ length_-gauge which suppresses the nuclear part and thus allows one to neglect it @xcite .",
    "this suppression , however , is not complete when there are states in the daughter nucleus close to the initial state .",
    "then , an additional contribution of these states to the emitted radiation must be taken into account .",
    "we find such a situation in @xmath0ni which decays by _",
    "2nu _ ec to @xmath0co . in the daughter nucleus there exist an excited state located only 26  kev above the initial state .",
    "first , we applied the new model to _ 2nu _ transitions and compared it with the experimental data published for the decay of @xmath0ni .",
    "this comparison revealed an excess of radiation in the high energy end of the gamma spectrum .",
    "we claim that it originates from virtual transitions through this excited state in @xmath0co .",
    "second , we derived the complete model , which includes the contribution from the virtual process , composed of allowed ec and e2 gamma transitions and its interference with the rec effect .",
    "it depends on two parameters involving nuclear matrix elements .",
    "we showed that when these parameters have values consistent with the estimated values of the relevant matrix elements , the model describes very well the measured spectrum .",
    "this finding is the first direct and unambiguous observation of virtual beta - gamma transitions .",
    "the radiation emitted in the ec decay of @xmath0ni is the coherent sum of both electronic and nuclear components .",
    "the latter is responsible for about 4% of the total intensity .",
