    "<S> emergence of neutrino physics is fueled by the recent growth in quality and quantity of experimental data , yet , there are still open questions . how much can the determination of mixing parameters be improved ? </S>",
    "<S> can we improve bounds on @xmath0 before experiments designed specifically for this parameter start ? how well can we determine or limit sterile fraction of neutrino flux from sun and sterile mixing angle ? </S>",
    "<S> we examine the impact of outcome from new measurements in the context of providing answers to these questions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    it is well established that , solar neutrinos primarily change into another active flavor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidences from solar@xcite , atmospheric@xcite , reactor@xcite and long - baseline@xcite experiments can be accommodated into the framework of neutrino mass , oscillations , and neutrino mixing . in this formalism </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that solar mixing angle , @xmath1 , is large@xcite , but not maximal , and atmospheric mixing angle , @xmath2 , is large , even maximal . </S>",
    "<S> matter effects probably plays a role in this transformation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the size of the third mixing angle , @xmath0 , is currently best limited by combined chooz reactor experiment and sk atmospheric data . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , we present bounds on @xmath0 under certain considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal shaded regions are 90% c.  l. and 99% c.  l. bounds on @xmath3 from superk atmospheric data . </S>",
    "<S> the thick ( thin ) dashed curve is the 90% c.  l. ( 3@xmath4 ) chooz bound . the 99% c.  l. region on @xmath3 extends as low as @xmath5ev@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> at the lower end of this region , @xmath0 is poorly constrained by chooz . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] are bounds from from chooz , kamland and solar data at 90% c.  l. and 3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that , the upper bound on @xmath0 from kamland and solar neutrino data gets stronger ( especially in the region with small @xmath7 where chooz reactor bound is relatively weak ) , and even dominates as this data gets refined . in order to examine the possible impact of new nc and cc measurements from ncd phase of sno experiment , we add two new hypothetical measurements with 1-@xmath4 uncertainties of 5.5% and 6.4% , and vary the corresponding central values by 1-@xmath4 around their salt - phase determinations . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded curved bands , showing how 90% c.  l. and 3@xmath4 bounds vary upon addition of these hypothetical data , suggest that the impact could be further improvement of the bounds on @xmath0 .     vs. @xmath8 from analyses , all solar and kamland data ( solid line ) and just sno and kamland data ( dashed line ) . </S>",

    "<S> the horizontal dotted lines are at the @xmath9 indicating n-@xmath4 confidence levels . @xmath10b flux is free.,scaledwidth=100.0%,height=188 ]    in simple 4-neutrino mixing scenarios , electron neutrinos change into some linear combination of active ( non - electron ) and sterile neutrinos , @xmath11 this is based on the assumption that the electron flavor is distributed among two eigenstates only . </S>",
    "<S> the sterile admixture is described by sterile mixing angle , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of oscillating neutrinos changing into active ( sterile ) flavor is given by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average survival probability of electron neutrinos , @xmath15 , for sno experiment can be calculated as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is @xmath18 spectrum and @xmath19 is cc cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependent survival probability , @xmath20 , is a function of both neutrino energy , @xmath21 , and mixing parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath1 , which can be taken from kamland experiment . </S>",
    "<S> matter effects has little effect on calculation of @xmath15 in the model we applied here ( especially when sterile fraction is small ) . </S>",
    "<S> sno experiment measures cc , @xmath23 , and nc , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is active fraction of the total flux and @xmath26 is solar @xmath27 neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> it is estimated that @xmath15 can be known up to 7% uncertainty@xcite , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be measured with 5.5% , 6.4% uncertainties in ncd phase of sno@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of oscillating neutrinos changing into active flavor can be cast into the form , @xmath30 we examine the fractional error , @xmath31 , which requires access to the value of @xmath18 flux . adapting ssm value , which has over 20% uncertainty , yields almost 30% fractional uncertainty on @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative way is extracting , @xmath18 flux from sno cc measurement , through the relation @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that fractional uncertainty on @xmath8 can be reduced below 20% by this substitution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is independent of solar model uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> another method to determine the uncertainty on @xmath8 is to perform a statistical analysis based on the oscillation formulae , where @xmath33 is a fit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we present results of such global analyses in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] projected on @xmath8 and marginalized over all other mixing parameters . the results consistent with non existence of sterile component in solar neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-@xmath4 bound for the analysis , in which solar and kamland data is considered ( the solid line in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , yields about 10% uncertainty on @xmath33 . when only sno and kamland data is considered ( the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) , the uncertainty on @xmath8 increases to about 20% ( which is comparable to the bound we obtained in simpler approach we utilized earlier , using @xmath15 determination from kamland and nc , cc measurements from sno ) . to conclude , oscillation of solar neutrinos into pure sterile flavor is not allowed but the possibility of a small sterile component in solar flux can not be eliminated within the current precision of model dependencies . in the long run , solar model model </S>",
    "<S> independent measurements , like nc determination by sno experiment , are the preferred way for studying the sterile neutrino fraction and/or sterile mixing angle in both simple approaches ( like the one we presented ) and full statistical analysis based on the oscillation formulae . </S>"
