    "over the last twenty years , our understanding of the galaxy distribution in the local universe has advanced dramatically .",
    "the observational success since the 1920s of friedmann universes reflects a fundamental aspect of the universe , its isotropy and homogeneity , expressed theoretically by the cosmological principle .",
    "indeed , it is in the context of friedmann universes that recent observations of the cosmic microwave background , snia and galaxy redshift surveys provide evidence for a non - zero cosmological constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations of large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution shows that on even quite large scales the universe is highly inhomogeneous , with the galaxy distribution tracing out a cosmic web of filamentary and wall - like structures .",
    "thus , the question arises as to the scales on which the universe can be viewed as isotropic and homogeneous , i.e. , the scales at which the cosmological principle can be said to hold .",
    "recent work on the local distribution of galaxies indicates the existence of ` great walls ' of @xmath15  in size and @xmath250  voids ( e.g. bellanger & de lapparent , 1995 ) .",
    "these observations would seem to support the possibility that the steeper than expected apm @xmath16-band galaxy counts over 4300 deg@xmath11 of the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) might indeed reflect a very large local hole in the universe ( shanks 1990 ) .",
    "but for our present understanding of the cosmic web , as gathered from dynamical n - body simulations , it would be unexpectedly large and deep ( baugh et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "such a local hole would clearly place stringent constraints on any model of large - scale structure .",
    "however , using ccd photometry metcalfe , fong &  shanks ( 1995 ) found a small residual scale error in the apm zero - points for @xmath1617 .",
    "the corrected apm counts fainter than @xmath17 were now in good agreement with the expected counts from normal homogeneous models ; a deficit of @xmath18% at @xmath19 still remained along with the possibility of a very large deep hole in the sgc .    the presence of an underdensity in the sgc is now being corroborated by preliminary results from deep galaxy redshift surveys , probing the galaxy distribution to @xmath20 .",

    "even with the preliminary data released by 2mass it is possible to test the observational results indicating a large hole .",
    "in particular , compared with the photgraphic apm survey , a survey based on digital photometry has fewer concerns over errors in the calibration and field - to - field variations in the zero - point and limiting magnitude .",
    "however , a complete interpretation of the 2mass infrared counts is at present hindered by uncertainties in the surveyed area arising from the incompleteness of the survey and an intricate mask not yet publicly available .    with the goal of determining the approximate variations in the galaxy distribution over the galactic caps , and the scale of local large - scale inhomogeneities , we have thus compared the @xmath12-band 2mass counts from several declination strips over the galactic caps with models incorporating the radial density functions of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al . , 2001 ) ,",
    "in their northern and southern areas . to see if the features seen in these strips persisted over larger solid angles we then examined the combined available counts for @xmath2330@xmath24 . for a more detailed view of these inhomogeneities , we used variations in the slope of the 2mass counts between @xmath25 and 13.38 as a probe of inhomogeneities on scales of @xmath26 . in section  2",

    "[ fig : apm ] show the predictions of these variable @xmath71 models for the northern and southern 2df counts respectively .",
    "the observed 2df counts and the corresponding models show excellent agreement .",
    "the low trends of the 2df sgc counts and the apm b@xmath4917 and apmbgc b@xmath7217 counts imply significant structure especially since the apm southern field covers @xmath73  deg@xmath11 .",

    "the 2df ngc variable @xmath71 model and 2df ngc counts are low but indicate a much smaller deficiency in the counts .",
    "this can be observed in the 2df ngc @xmath21 ( fig .  [ fig : z2dfn ] ) which is closer to the homogeneous prediction .",
    "this apparent asymmetry in the sgc and ngc @xmath21 and the scale and distance of the sgc inhomogeneities are intriguing , and can be further investigated using the presently released 2mass data .",
    "= 5.5 in    = 5.5 in    = 6.5 in    the asymmetry observed in the sgc and ngc optical magnitude counts and 2dfgrs n(z ) can be further investigated using the 2mass second incremental release .",
    "firstly , we wish to examine the trend of the k - band counts for the 2df fields to determine whether the observed deficiencies and north - south asymmetry is present in the k - band , and also to verify the usefulness of the variable @xmath71 models described in section 3.1 . fig .",
    "[ fig : m2df ] shows the 2mass @xmath12 counts extracted from the approximate 2df 100k data release fields for which 2mass data is available .",
    "also shown are the homogeneous prediction and the variable @xmath71 models for the 2dfgrs sgc and ngc fields using the radial density function for @xmath66 ( approximately matching the limiting @xmath12 magnitude of 2mass and therefore more likely to produce a better description of the counts ) .",
    "unfortunately , the 2mass mask for the second incremental release is fairly complex and the effective areas had to be determined approximately .",
    "this was carried out by searching for gaps in the 2mass astrometry of over 0.5 degrees on the right ascension axis in 0.5 degree declination strips ; the maximum right ascension range of any missing area was then determined .",
    "the declination range of unobserved areas was similarly inferred yielding an upper limit on the area of the missing region .",
    "a visual inspection of the distribution of the 2mass galaxies on the sky reveals that this estimate of the effective area is likely to be reasonably good for fairly complete strips .",
    "the resulting @xmath12 counts are in excellent agreement with the @xmath16-band 2df counts ; comparing the counts at approximately equivalent magnitudes , the northern counts indicate deficiencies of 0.0% ( at @xmath76 ) and 2.7% ( at @xmath77 ) , and the southern counts deficiencies of 28% ( at @xmath78 ) and 32% ( at @xmath77 )",
    ". the @xmath12 counts for the 2df fields are also in approximate agreement with the predictions of the corresponding variable @xmath71 models .",
    "together with the structure seen in the 2df @xmath21 , these 2mass @xmath12 counts show that such bright counts in areas as small as @xmath79  deg@xmath11 can be used as a diagnostic probe of large underdensities at distances of @xmath80  since the slope of the counts between @xmath8111 and @xmath8113 is dependent on the redshift distribution at these distances ; small fluctuations in the galaxy distribution at greater distances have little effect on the number counts at these magnitudes ( frith 2001 ) .    using this comparison between bright counts and the 2df variable @xmath71 models ,",
    "it is now possible to investigate the angular extent of the local hole in the sgc using 2mass . to this end",
    ", the counts were determined for six 5 degree declination strips in the sgc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] ) , each with approximately the same solid angle and right ascension range as the current 2df fields ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : m2df ] ) . in order to determine the robustness of the north ",
    "south asymmetry observed in the 2df survey and the corresponding @xmath16 and @xmath12 band counts , 2mass counts were also taken for another six similar strips in the ngc .",
    "the number and positions of these strips were restricted firstly by the constraints of the mask of the available 2mass data , and secondly by regions of significant extinction ; declinations with @xmath82 were selected .",
    "the southern strip counts in fig .  [ fig : strip ] are in approximate agreement with the 2df sgc variable @xmath71 model with a uniform steep slope in the counts over the entire declination range , similar to the 2mass counts for the 2df sgc field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m2df ] ) , indicating that the ` local hole ' extends as far north as @xmath83 in the sgp , and as far south as can be sampled with the present 2mass catalogue . considering that the lcrs @xmath21 ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates a similar underdensity at @xmath80 , @xmath75 south of the 2df sgp field , it would seem to support the presence of a ` local hole ' in the sgc of at least @xmath84 in extent ( @xmath85% of the apm sgc area ) .    in the northern strips , the counts in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] are more varied with approximate agreement with the 2df ngc varaiable @xmath71 model and the form of the 2mass counts for the 2df ngc field in all but two strips .",
    "the shallow counts in the third strip ( @xmath86 ) are probably due to the presence of the coma cluster and its associated supercluster .    in the strip counts of both hemispheres , similar mean deficiencies for the southern and northern aggregated counts at @xmath87 of @xmath88%",
    "are found corresponding to a mean depth of @xmath89mpc , possibly indicating that the inhomogeneities in the local galaxy distribution exist on larger scales .",
    "it is worth noting that the slopes of the counts in the northern strips in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] are fairly close to euclidean , and that a renormalisation of the model or a 10% error in the effective areas would compensate for the apparent deficiency .",
    "however , these compensation effects are likely to be fairly small since , firstly , any change in the model normalisation would affect the excellent agreement the model has with fainter k - band data ( e.g. gardner et al . , 1996 ; huang et al . , 1996 ; glazebrook et al . , 1995 ) , and secondly , since any significant recalculation of the effective areas would upset the excellent agreement of the 2df optical magnitude counts with the 2mass counts for the 2df fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m2df ] ) which are normalised using the same method as the two sets of six 2mass strips in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] .      to investigate the local galaxy distribution further",
    ", we have extended the area studied from the two sets of six strips to an area over the galactic caps to @xmath90 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : caps ] ) . moving to these larger areas",
    ", we see that the hole in the sgc persists with a deficiency of @xmath2% with respect to the homogeneous model at @xmath77 , similar to those seen in the sgc strips . in the ngc ,",
    "the approximate homogeneous trend observed in the b@xmath9117.5 2df ngp n(z ) is replaced by counts which are underdense by @xmath8% at @xmath77 , indicating the possible presence of a large void in the ngc as well as the sgc .",
    "it is interesting to note also that the counts in both hemispheres display comparable deficiencies of @xmath620% at @xmath12=11.63 .",
    "clearly as the northern area gets bigger , the picture gets more complicated with areas of underdensity also appearing as in the sgc .    due to the complexity of the mask for the 2mass second incremental release ,",
    "we have found it difficult to estimate the actual solid angle surveyed and have simply normalized the counts in fig .  [",
    "fig : caps ] to the mean number density observed in the corresponding set of strips in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip ] at the @xmath87 half magnitude bin ; this is likely to be a reasonable procedure since the implied solid angle of the 2mass mask over the galactic caps is only a factor of @xmath92 larger than the combined effective area of the strips .",
    "thus , the north ",
    "south asymmetry observed in the 2dfgrs n(z ) and optical magnitude counts and the 2mass counts selected for 2df declination strips appears to be in disagreement with the 2mass counts over the galactic caps .",
    "a possible explanation comes from a more detailed analysis over larger areas provided in the next section .",
    "finally , we wish to investigate the form and extent of the local hole at a higher resolution and over a larger area than the @xmath90 areas while avoiding calculations of the effective area .",
    "it is clear from the 2mass counts and the variable @xmath71 models that an essential signature for a local hole at @xmath80  distance is the steep slope between @xmath3 and @xmath93 .",
    "we have therefore examined the 2mass galaxy counts over the entire available area in this magnitude range binned in 25 deg@xmath11 areas with a constant declination range of @xmath94 . with the distances",
    "being explored at these magnitude limits , this amounts to a smoothing on a linear scale of @xmath95 . for each area",
    "we then calculated the ratio of the number of galaxies in the whole magnitude bin @xmath9 , to that in the half - magnitude bin @xmath10 , a procedure in which the two numbers are similar and the error on the ratio reasonable . finally , we divided this ratio by the predicted ratio of the homogeneous model .",
    "this ` slope statistic ' is then a measure of how steep or shallow the counts are relative to the homogenous slope .",
    "equivalently , if we assume the counts in 25 deg@xmath11 areas are approximately homogeneous by @xmath87 , the ratio is then just the observed count in the @xmath96 half magnitude bin as a fraction of that predicted by the homogeneous model ; it then indicates the extent to which the area is underdense or overdense at distances of @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , for this latter interpretation of the ` slope statistic ' there is some error , as the smoothing area is an order of magnitude smaller than the declination strips of the previous section and so a uniform number density in the @xmath87 bin , as is observed in the strips , can not be assumed .",
    "however , it may at least prove useful as a qualitative probe of local density inhomogeneities .",
    "[ fig : map ] is a contour map of this statistic .",
    "a particular advantage of this technique is that it is independent of an accurate determination of the effective area , while allowing us to probe the galaxy distribution over large contiguous areas of sky in the volume below @xmath80 .",
    "however , galaxy magnitudes at low galactic latitudes of @xmath97 begin to be effected by significant extinction even in the @xmath55-band , and the mapped statistic in these regions is unreliable for the purposes here .    the use of the map in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] as an indicator of inhomogeneities in the distribution of galaxies on the sky is supported by , first , its ability to pick out known clusters at distances of @xmath13 ; the coma cluster and its associated supercluster can clearly be seen ; the shapley cluster also appears as a high density area .",
    "secondly , we also see generally good agreement with the results in the previous section for the declination strips .",
    "this is typified by the more patchy form of the galaxy distribution in the ngc than in the sgc , where overdense regions exist around the pole but accidentally cancel with surrounding underdensities to produce low counts in four of the ngc strips .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] it can also be observed that the very large ` local hole ' that we have been exploring in the sgc is a coherent aggregation of smaller holes . in particular",
    ", we see that the 2df sgc area lies in a general region of such holes or voids , with a remarkably large area of right ascension between @xmath98 and @xmath99 and declination between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "[ fig : map ] also supports the relative similarity of the ngc and sgc cap counts for @xmath7 with large regions of shallow counts in the ngc countered only by the area of steeper counts at the ngp .",
    "it is also now apparent why the counts in the northern strip 3 have a much flatter slope than the southern strips and the northern and southern cap counts , since there appears to be a particularly dense region in the galaxy distribution over the ngp , surrounded by a region of much shallower counts , further supporting the possibility of a large void in the ngc .",
    "[ fig : map ] also indicates that the galaxy distribution is highly varied as might be expected with the cosmic web smoothed on scales of @xmath95 . in particular , individual deep holes , underdense by as much as @xmath102% , with sizes of @xmath95@xmath103 can also be observed .",
    "considering the depth of the survey this corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath10460 , similar to the scale of voids found using large redshift surveys ( e.g. bellanger & de lapparent , 1995 ) .",
    "in this paper , we first reviewed the evidence from apm and 2dfgrs optical number - magnitude counts that the b@xmath7218 mag . counts particularly in the sgc are steeper than expected on the basis of simple homogeneous models .",
    "one possible interpretation is that this is caused by a large local hole in the distribution of galaxies .",
    "however , other possible interpretations are that the effect is caused by evolution or poor photographic photometry .",
    "new data , principally the 2dfgrs @xmath21 and the 2mass second incremental release , have therefore been used to discriminate between these various possibilities . with the 2dfgrs",
    ", any local hole can be sought in the redshift distribution directly and the 2mass @xmath12 counts can be used as a check of the steepness of local galaxy counts in a band where a linear detector has been used and the effects of evolution are likely to be less than in the @xmath16-band .    the 2mass data is not in its final form and there are problems in particular with an uncertain mask in various areas of the survey .",
    "we therefore first made a detailed analysis of the 2mass data in the ngc and sgc 2dfgrs fields each of @xmath6300 deg@xmath11 area to check for the hole in the south and investigate the previous apparent north  south asymmetry in the counts .",
    "then we extended this approach to a wider area of the ngc and sgc , first using strip counts in @xmath61800deg@xmath11 areas near each of the galactic poles in each hemisphere , then overall ngc and sgc counts based on all available 2mass areas with @xmath2330@xmath24 .",
    "finally , using a 2mass count ` slope statistic ' , we made a higher resolution ( @xmath610 ) map to investigate the detailed form of the large - scale structure to an average depth of @xmath6150 , again over the full available 2mass area .",
    "the results are summarised as follows:-    * the 2mass @xmath12 number count in the 2dfgrs sgc field is significantly steeper than in the 2dfgrs ngc field , consistent with previous results in the @xmath16-band . *",
    "large holes are seen in the galaxy distribution in the 2dfgrs sgc @xmath66 @xmath21 out to z@xmath720.1 which are not seen in the ngc 2dfgrs @xmath66 @xmath21 .",
    "* variable @xmath71 number count models which track the 2dfgrs @xmath21 s give a good fit to the @xmath12-band galaxy counts in both the ngc and sgc 2dfgrs areas , suggesting that the steep sgc counts are due to the holes in the 2dfgrs sgc @xmath21 .",
    "* the six 2mass sgc strip counts over an @xmath62000 deg@xmath11 area consistently show the same underdensity as seen in the 2dfgrs sgc field",
    ". counts over a similar area in the ngc show a more varied behaviour with some strips being higher than even the homogeneous model and others starting to show the same level of underdensity as seen in the sgp .",
    "* 2mass @xmath12 counts over the whole sgc and ngc areas with @xmath2330@xmath24 indicate an underdensity in the sgc which is only slightly less than in the 2dfgrs sgc field and an increased underdensity in the ngc area . *",
    "examining the 2mass counts at a higher resolution with the ` slope statistic ' reveals a more patchy form to the galaxy distribution in the ngc than in the sgc .",
    "in particular , overdensities associated with the coma and shapley clusters can clearly be detected .",
    "these areas are surrounded by regions of underdensity resulting in the reasonably homogeneous counts seen in the 2dfgrs ngc field and the six ngc strips .",
    "the sgc shows more evidence of contiguous underdensity again consistent with the steep @xmath12 counts seen in the 2dfgrs sgc field and the six sgc strip counts . * using the evidence from 2mass using the ` slope statistic ' and the six sgc strips , and also the underdensity seen in the lcrs ( shectman et al . 1996 ) , we conclude that an underdensity of @xmath630% in the sgc extends over at least 280@xmath10550@xmath24 and -45@xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to a linear size across the sky of @xmath6200 . * the ` slope statistic ' map also supports the form of the @xmath108 counts , indicating large regions of underdensity in the ngc away from the ngp and moderated only by the effect of the coma cluster at the pole , indicating the possible presence of a huge , connected local underdensity present in both galactic caps of scale 300 .",

    "<S> using the bright galaxy counts from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) second incremental release , two techniques for probing large - scale structure at distances of @xmath0  are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> first , we study the counts from two sets of six @xmath1 strips in the two galactic caps . in the six southern </S>",
    "<S> strips a deficit of @xmath2% was found relative to a predicted homogeneous distribution at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these strips were also in good agreement with a model incorporating the radial density function of the southern 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , which shows a deep underdensity between @xmath4 and 180 . together with a similar underdensity found in the las campanas redshift survey , these results indicate a very large ` local hole ' in the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) to 150  with a linear size across the sky of @xmath5 but with a significantly lower mean underdensity of @xmath630% than that suggested by the bright apm sgc counts . </S>",
    "<S> the counts in the northern set of strips are low overall but indicate a more varied pattern . </S>",
    "<S> when all the available 2mass data with @xmath7 were aggregated , they indicated underdensities of @xmath8% and @xmath2% at @xmath3 for the northern and southern areas respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our second method uses the ratio of the counts with @xmath9 to @xmath10 binned in 25 deg@xmath11 areas ; the counts from these areas provide a smoothed map over the sky of the slope in the counts between @xmath12=11.38 and  13.38 . </S>",
    "<S> visually , the resulting map shows the expected complex form of the cosmic web and picks out known rich clusters , demonstrating the usefulness of this ` slope statistic ' as a probe of large - scale structure at distances of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , the map also shows large regions , @xmath14 across , of steep counts in both hemispheres . </S>",
    "<S> thus , </S>",
    "<S> the present 2mass data suggest the presence of a potentially huge contiguous void stretching from south to north . not only would this delineate further the limits for the cosmological principle but it would also show the possible presence of significant power on scales of 300  in the galaxy power spectrum .    </S>",
