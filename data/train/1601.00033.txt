    "multi - frame blind deconvolution algorithms are used to recover a target scene from a set of blurry , noisy and distorted observations .",
    "they are generally categorized into two types : ( 1 ) non - blind deconvolution , where the target scene is reconstructed based on complete or partial knowledge of the point spread function(psf ) of the imaging system ; and ( 2 ) blind deconvolution , where the unknown target scene and system point spread function are recovered simultaneously without a priori knowledge . since the work of ayers and dainty@xcite , multi - frame blind deconvolution has become an important tool for image recovery , resulting in numerous research efforts and applications .",
    "common approaches involve : ( 1 ) batch mode multi - frame blind deconvolution@xcite , where all the distorted observations are processed at the same time ; and ( 2 ) serial mode multi - frame blind deconvolution@xcite , where degraded inputs are sequentially processed . compared with the batch mode ,",
    "the serial approach is more memory efficient and can in principle be done at the same time as the image acquisition . in this paper image restoration",
    "was accomplished by use of a serial multi - frame blind deconvolution@xcite scheme .",
    "here we give a brief review of the online multi - frame blind deconvolution algorithm .",
    "we assume that at each time point @xmath24 , the random aperture mirror system records a blurred image @xmath25 . assuming the imaging system is shift - invariant(or approximate shift - invariant ) , the image formation process can be modeled as convolution of the target image and the system psf , where the recorded @xmath26 image @xmath27 may be expressed :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 denotes the two - dimensional convolution operator , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively represent the ideal image and its random noise , and @xmath32 represents the shift - invariant psf of the @xmath26 time frame .",
    "we assume the psf changes from frame to frame owing to time varying tip , tilt , and piston errors , as well as the location of each mirror .",

    "numerically generated data is then used to demonstrate the reconstruction of a monochromatic binary light source under different tip - tilt and piston errors .",
    "quantitative comparisons between ground truth and reconstructed images are evaluated based on two metrics : spatial separation error @xmath47 and the peak intensity ratio error @xmath48 , where @xmath0 and @xmath49 are the respective distances between the peaks of the ground truth and restored images respectively , and where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the respective peak intensities of the ground truth and restored results .",
    "reconstructed images were obtained by use of @xmath52 images for both the far field and near field schemes .",
    "details of the experimental setup and parameters are discussed in section 4 and table 1 .",
    "the restored images of a binary light source and examples of speckle images are shown in fig 6 .",
    "immediately we see in both cases that the reconstructed images are superior to the speckle images , i.e , qualitative agreement with the ground truth is acheived .",
    "quantitatively , we find the distance between the intensity peaks are in good agreement , with @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore the intensity peaks are equal to within @xmath54 .",
    "this is remarkable considering the @xmath55 bandwidth of the light source , and the estimated @xmath56 tip - tilt error and a likely piston error of at least several waves .",
    "the good agreement between the ground truth and reconstructed images may be attributed to the high degree of shift invariance of the imaging systems .",
    "that is , the speckle data in both fig 6.(b ) and ( d ) contains multiple overlapping pairs of binary images .",
    "we note that in the far field ( diffracted ) case the pairs displaced from the central region of the speckle image are diffused owing to the broad bandwidth of the light source .",
    "in contrast , for the near field case , the beamlets from each reflecting element experience little diffraction , and thus no chromatic spreading of the beamlets .",
    "we believe the multiframe bd scheme is successful at recovering the binary light source in both cases because the underlying imaging systems are well described by a shift invariant convolution process .",
    "[ fig : fig_exp_farfield ]          to explore how well multiframe blind deconvolution restores a binary image from random aperture mirror images , numerically simulated far field and near field data were generated for various degrees of tip - tilt and piston error .",

    "first we examine numerical cases that closely resemble the experimental system . for both the near and far field schemes we numerically generated speckled images with 50 non - overlapping sub - apertures .",
    "gaussian random tip - tilt error with @xmath57 and uniform random piston error with @xmath58 were assumed for each of the @xmath59 images of the generated sequence . shown in fig 7",

    "the insets show a zoomed image of the ground truth in fig 7.(a ) , and the corresponding reconstructed images in fig 7.(b , c ) . as in the experimental case ,",
    "the qualitative agreement between the ground truth and reconstructed images is good .",
    "quantitatively the spatial separation error is @xmath60 for both cases , and the magnitude ratio error is @xmath61 is less than @xmath62 .",
    "these errors are smaller than the experimental values because the numerical cases are noise free and monochromatic .",
    "we found that the near field values of @xmath63 and @xmath61 are somewhat larger than the far field values .",
    "we attributed this difference to the lower degree of shift invariance in the near field case owing to different projections of the beamlets on the detector plane .    to examine the fidelity of reconstructed image as a function of tip - tilt and piston error",

    "in these cases we set the number of sub - apertures to @xmath66 , and the number of images to @xmath52 .",
    "as expected , the quality of the reconstructed images deteriorates with increasing phase error .",
    "the reconstruction errors increase from @xmath67 , @xmath68 to @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 to @xmath72 as the tip - tilt error increase from @xmath73 to @xmath74 to @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , as the increment of piston error increases from @xmath76 to @xmath77 to @xmath78 , the errors for the restoration increase from @xmath79 , @xmath80 to @xmath81 , and @xmath82 increase from @xmath83 , @xmath84 to @xmath85 . for both tip - tilt and piston error",
    "we find the magnitude ratio error suffers more significantly than the spatial separation error .",
    "we attribute this to the increased intensity of speckles and interference patterns that are resulted from sufficiently large phase errors .",
    "[ fig : fig_num_farvsnear ]        [ fig : fig_num_farfield_tiptilt ]        [ fig : fig_num_farfield_piston ]",
    "we numerically and experimentally explored the concept of random aperture mirror telescope for both monochromatic binary light sources and polychromatic binary light sources , in both far field and near field schemes .",
    "for an approximate shift - invariant system , binary light sources can be restored using multi - frame blind deconvolution techniques from both experimental and numerical data with reconstruction error kept in a tight tolerance .",
    "the numerical results further demonstrate that for an approximate shift - invariant system , a near diffraction limit resolution ( @xmath86 ) can be achieved in the presence of tip - tilt of 40@xmath87 and piston phase up to 1.0@xmath88 for monochromatic sources .",
    "several interesting aspects remain yet to be analyzed .",
