    "weak measurements are topical subjects in modern quantum mechanics . since the proposal of the weak measurement by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav )  @xcite in 1988 , many theoretical and experimental researches have been carried out .",
    "the idea of weak measurement has been used to resolve fundamental issues in quantum mechanics such as hardy s paradox  @xcite , violation of the leggett - garg inequality  @xcite , and the error - disturbance relation  @xcite derived by ozawa  @xcite . on the other hand , many experiments  @xcite show that the weak measurement is also very useful for high - precision measurements .",
    "the original proposal by aav is based on von - neumann s measurement theory  @xcite in which the whole system involves a quantum system to be measured and a measuring device to measure it . according to the aav scenario , weak measurements have four steps :",
    "the first one is the preparation of the initial state of the system ( pre - selection ) as well as the measuring device ; the second one is to induce an interaction weakly between the system and the measuring device ; the third one is the selection of the final state of the system ( post - selection ) by the projection measurement ; and the final one is the measurement of the state of the measuring device . through these four steps ,",
    "the experimentally obtained value in the _ linear - order _ of the weak interaction between the system and the measuring device is not an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath0 of the system but the weak value of the operator @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the pre- and post - selected states of the system , respectively .",
    "along this aav scenario of weak measurement , one of the authors revealed some properties of weak measurements taking into account of non - linear effects of the von - neumann interaction  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the arguments are restricted to an operator @xmath0 which satisfies the property @xmath3 and the _ all - order _ evaluations with respect to the coupling constant in the von - neumann interaction @xmath4 have been carried out . as the results , it is shown that the final results of weak measurements are given by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the canonical variables for the measuring device ( @xmath8=i$ ] , @xmath9 ) , the initial state of the measuring device was assumed to be the zero mean - value gaussian , and @xmath10 is a parameter of the measurement strength defined by @xmath11 with the initial momentum variance @xmath12 of the measuring device , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the expectation value of the pointer variable and its conjugate momentum after the post - selection .    on the other hand , the experimental group of one of the authors  @xcite realized a weak measurement of a photon polarization close to ideal and showed that the back - action effects in the weak measurement have an important role in the regime where the weak value becomes large .",

    "this choice gives rise to the other difficulty that we can not distinguish the pre - selected state of only the system , because the entangled state involves both initial states of the measuring device and the system . to treat this state as the pre - selected state",

    "these two interpretations are essentially equivalent to each other . in section  [ sec : fluctuations ] , we discuss the behavior of the fluctuations in the final measurement in istkh .",
    "final section ( section  [ sec : summary_and_discussion ] ) is devoted to summary and discussions which include discussions on the consistency with experimental results .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the natural unit @xmath9 .",
    "here , we briefly summarize the experimental setup in istkh . the details of the setup is given in istkh , but we restrict the explanation to only significant points in the experiment . the essential part of this experiment setup is depicted in figure  [ fig : essence_of_istkh2011_setup ] .    in istkh ,",
    "the observable in the system is the polarization of photons and the pointer in the measuring device is the which - path information .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : essence_of_istkh2011_setup ] , the incident photons from the laser go through the glan - thompson prism ( gtp ) and the half - wave plate ( hwp ) before the polarized beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the gtp and hwp can transmit the photon with the linear polarization and control the polarization angle of the incident photons .",
    "therefore , these optical components are used for preparation of the initial pure state @xmath22 given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are restricted to real numbers in this paper . each polarization state @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the horizontal and the vertical polarization , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the pbs separates the initial beam into two paths @xmath29 and simultaneously also the photon polarization into the horizontal state @xmath27 and the vertical state @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the pbs produces the entangled state of the photon polarization and the path as @xmath30    after the pbs , the photons go through the other hwp on each path a1 and a2 inside of the interferometer . in the path a1 , where the polarization state just before the hwp is @xmath28 , the polarization is rotated by @xmath31 to the clockwise direction by the hwp . on the other hand , in the path a2 , where the polarization state just before the hwp is @xmath27 , the polarization is rotated by @xmath32 to the counter - clockwise direction by the hwp .",
    "these rotations of the polarizations are regarded as the weak interaction in the weak measurement .",
    "each path a1 and a2 is overlapped at the beam splitter ( bs ) with the 50:50 ratio of the transmittance to the reflectance and the photon s path - state is transformed into the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 the transformation ( [ eq : b1b2-a1a2-relation ] ) of the hilbert space @xmath29 to the hilbert space @xmath36 is an unitary transformation which satisfies @xmath37    on the path b2 from the output port of bs , a hwp is installed to disentangle the system and the measuring device .",
    "after the bs , the photons go through a polarizer on each path b1 and b2 for the post - selection of the weak measurement . in the istkh experiment ,",
    "the final polarization state is selected to the horizontal state @xmath27 by these polarizers .",
    "the photons in each path b1 and b2 are detected by the single photon detector on each path .",
    "the number of photons are counted and their results give the conditional probabilities associated with the which - path information @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here , we denote these probability distributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .    finally , the difference @xmath40 is calculated , because the weak value is obtained by dividing an average of the pointer variable with the obtained conditional probabilities by the measurement strength .",
    "therefore , the difference of the conditional probabilities @xmath40 can be considered as the final result in this experiment .    according to istkh",
    ", the expression of @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",

    "( [ eq : pb1-pb2_in_istkh2011 - 2 ] ) along the original scenario by aav  @xcite .",
    "in the original aav argument  @xcite , the weak measurement consists of four processes , pre - selection , weak interaction , post - selection , and the final measurement of the measuring device .",
    "however , these serial processes do not explicitly include the entanglement creation .",
    "therefore , the correspondence between a sequence of the above processes and an alternative sequence in the istkh experiment remains unclear .",
    "one of ways for excluding the entanglement creation from the whole process of the weak measurement is to use the state eq .",
    "( [ eq : pre - selected - state ] ) as the pre - selected state instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : init - state ] ) .",
    "this requires a mathematically equivalent treatment for the device s state as the system s one . in this paper , we resolved this problem by the introduction of two _ extended weak values _ associated also with the final state of the measuring device , which are defined in later ( eqs .",

    "it is therefore straightforward to treat the photon polarization with the basis of @xmath43 as the `` system '' . for the selection of @xmath27 as the final state , the effect of the hwp installed just after the bs does not consequently affect the final result @xmath40 , because this hwp just gives the @xmath44 phase difference between the state @xmath27 and the state @xmath28 .",
    "this final result can be obtained by the final measurement of the `` measuring device '' , that is the projection measurement to the basis @xmath36 representing which - path information .",

    "the above equation shows that @xmath40 is the expectation value of the which - path operator @xmath47 and the final measurement corresponds to the projection measurement of the hilbert space @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining correspondence is on the process of the weak interaction between the system and the measuring device .",
    "the identification of the interaction hamiltonian in the istkh experiment is necessary to understand the full process along the aav s scenario .",
    "we found that two effective interaction hamiltonians , which provide the explanation of the istkh experiment in a different but essentially equivalent way .",
    "one is the interpretation by a real extended weak value for the operator @xmath48 and another is by an imaginary extended weak value for @xmath49 .",
    "these two interpretations give the essentially same results .",
    "thus , both of these interpretations reproduce the result of the istkh experiment along the original proposal of aav  @xcite .",
    "the polarization in each path a1 and a2 is rotated in opposite direction by the hwps inside the interferometer . as the effective hamiltonian describing the interaction between the polarization and the which - path operator , we consider the following form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an angle of the fast axis of hwp from the horizontal axis and @xmath52 represents a phase difference between the fast component and the slow component after passing through the hwp . in the case of hwp ,",

    "@xcite .",
    "the equivalence of two re - interpretation is very interesting , because the usual argument on weak measurement  @xcite shows that the real and imaginary parts of weak value emerges as the shift in the average of the pointer variable and its conjugate momentum , respectively . unlike this argument",
    ", the istkh experiment is the first example of the experiment which can be regarded as not only the measurement of a real weak value , but also that of an imaginary weak values at the same time .",
    "this interesting feature is obviously provided by the properties of pauli operators .",
    "therefore , the similar weak measurements of qubit systems have a possibility of including the same feature .",
    "however , many experiments of qubit systems do not need a knowledge of the explicit form of the effective hamiltonian in the aspect of practical implementations , so that there have been no such arguments yet .",
    "in addition , we also showed that the fluctuations in the expectation value for both interpretations result in the completely same formula .",
    "we found the optimal condition in the measurement strength @xmath51 , where the fluctuations vanish for a fixed weak value .",
    "this vanishing fluctuations do not certainly provide the infinity of the signal to noise ratio in the optimal condition because of the presence of other noise sources ( for example , shot noise , imperfection in the setup , and so on ) . however , this feature of the fluctuation in the optimal condition is potentially useful for the improvement of the signal to noise ratio . in the reference  @xcite , they discussed the precision of a phase measurement by the weak measurement in the shot - noise limited interferometer and found that the photo - detector dominantly produces the photon shot - noise which determines the signal to noise ratio .",
    "in the istkh experiment , the state just after the post - selection may be identified to the eigenstates of the which - path operator in the final measurement , so that the fluctuation becomes very small . this is a new theoretical result on fluctuations and predicts that there are in principle rooms of the improvement of the fluctuations in the istkh experiments .",
    "the considaration in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper implies that the final measurement of the detector in weak measurements is crucial when we want to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "the behavior of these fluctuations is consistent with the current experiment  @xcite . in the similar condition to ref .",
    "@xcite , the above calculation gives the optimal condition of @xmath132 for the vanishing fluctuation . from ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental data at @xmath133 shows @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which corresponds to the minimum fluctuation in all experimental data obtained by changing @xmath51 discretely . in comparison with @xmath136 ,",
    "for example , they obtained @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the error at @xmath139 is 2.44 times as large as the error at @xmath133 .",
    "this factor corresponds to 6 times lower statistics at @xmath133 , but the statistics at any @xmath51 is almost same and the difference is absolutely less than the factor two . taking into account the presence of noise sources , such as imperfection of visibility , shot noise , etc .",
    ", the minimum in fluctuation at @xmath133 is consistent with the above calculation .",
    "however , no systematic experiments have been carried out yet for the test of these theoretical predictions on fluctuations in detail .",
    "finally , we give a comment on the other possibility of interpretations of the istkh experiment . in this paper",
    ", we choose the maximal entangled state as the pre - selected state and the new problem arisen from the indistinguishability between the system and the measuring device was overcome by introducing the extended weak values .",
    "apart from such way , it may be also possible to assign the initial polarization state ( [ eq : init - state ] ) to the pre - selected state in the same way as the istkh setup . in this case , although it is not necessary to introduce the extended weak values , we have to include the entanglement creation into the four processes of the weak measurements .",
    "since the creation of the entangled state is also represented by the unitary operator , the effective hamiltonian corresponding to the unitary transformation included the creation process should be expressed as the specific mathematical form .",
    "if we find this form , it will become possible to make the other re - interpretation along the original aav argument with treating the initial polarization state ( [ eq : init - state ] ) as the pre - selected state .",
    "although we leave this possibility of the interpretation as future works , we note that many other interpretations for this experiment will also be possible .",
