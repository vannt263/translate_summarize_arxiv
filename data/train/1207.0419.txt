    "we propose the analysis of all possible solutions of the problem under consideration .",

    "we have to accept that a chameleon field has a minimum at @xmath36 , which is caused by the properties of the effective potential @xmath67 but not a spatial region of a location of a chameleon field .",

    "in this section , we propose a numerical solution of eq.([eq:34 ] ) for a chameleon field in the spatial region @xmath63 between two mirrors with a density @xmath94 separated by the distance @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "first of all we would like note that due to a symmetry of the spatial region a chameleon field as a scalar field is symmetric with respect to a transformation @xmath156 , i.e. @xmath157 . for a numerical solution we transcribe eq.([eq:34 ] ) into the form [ eq:81 ] = ^t()_0 , where @xmath158 , @xmath83 is given by eq.([eq:43 ] ) and @xmath159 is the absolute value of @xmath23 . as a result",
    "we define a chameleon field as a function of @xmath159 , i.e. @xmath160 . such a non  analytical dependence of a chameleon field on a spatial variable does not prevent it to satisfy the equation of motion eq.([eq:28 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the first derivative of a chameleon field with respect to @xmath23 is equal to [ eq:82 ] = ( z ) , where @xmath161 is a sign function , defined by @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the heaviside functions @xcite . for the second derivative we obtain the following expression @xmath164 where we have used that @xmath165 and @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "thus , due to a continuous derivative of a chameleon field at @xmath19 a dependence of a chameleon field on the absolute value of @xmath23 does not introduce an additional terms violating the equation of motion eq.([eq:28 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath167 the integral eq.([eq:81 ] ) can be calculated exactly .",
    "we obtain [ eq:84 ] = t + arcsin t. this gives a chameleon field as a function of @xmath168 [ eq:85 ] ( z ) = _ 0(1 - t^2 ( ) ) . in fig.1",
    "we show the profiles of a chameleon field , obtained in the spatial region @xmath9 in the strong coupling limit by a numerical solution of eq.([eq:81 ] ) for the experimental mirror density @xmath87 and @xmath107 and @xmath169 $ ] .",

    "@xmath9 as the solutions of eq.([eq:81 ] ) , calculated numerically in the strong coupling limit , in comparison with the approximate solution eq.([eq:86 ] ( dashed lines ) for @xmath169 $ ] . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]     in the spatial region @xmath9 , obtained in the strong coupling limit for @xmath169 $ ] . ]",
    "the dashed lines describe the approximate solutions , whereas the solid line correspond to the exact numerical solutions of eq.([eq:81 ] ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath86 the dashed and solid lines coincide , since for @xmath86 the problem admits the analytical solution in the elementary functions .",
    "such an agreement confirms the correctness all numerical solutions , obtained for @xmath171 $ ] . starting with @xmath172",
    "the approximate solution is larger compared with the exact numerical solutions .",
    "following such a behaviour of the approximate solutions and keeping in mind that the exact solutions of a chameleon field taken in the vicinity of a mirror @xmath173 should reproduce the solutions eq.([eq:22 ] ) , for the fit of the exact numerical solutions of a chameleon field we propose the function @xmath174 where @xmath83 is equal to [ eq:87c ] _ 0 = ( d)^ , the results of the fit are shown in fig.4 .",
    "one may see that eq.([eq:87 ] ) fits well the numerical solutions of the non  linear equation of motion of a chameleon field and can be used for the analytical description of a chameleon field in the spatial region @xmath9 between two mirrors with a density @xmath87 in the strong coupling limit @xmath175 and an arbitrary @xmath10 . for @xmath176",
    "the parameter @xmath83 , given by eq.([eq:87c ] ) reproduces the exact @xmath83 , defined by eq.([eq:43 ] ) , with an accuracy better than @xmath177 .",
    "we have analyzed the solutions for a chameleon field , localized between two mirrors in the spatial region @xmath63 , and its influence on the transition frequencies of the quantum gravitational states of ultra - cold neutron , bouncing between two mirrors in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "for the power @xmath178 of the potential of a chameleon field we have found the exact analytical solutions of non  linear equations of motion .",
    "we have shown that for the experimental density of mirrors @xmath179 and a relative distance between mirrors @xmath107 @xcite the obtained solutions obey the strong coupling regime with @xmath57 .",
    "in such a regime a chameleon field does not depend on the coupling constant . as a result",
    "the contribution of a chameleon field to the transition frequencies of ultra - cold neutrons , bouncing in the gravitational field of the earth between two mirrors , is proportional to the coupling constant @xmath2 .    in the strong coupling limit @xmath180",
    "we have obtained the approximate solutions of non  linear and linearized equations of motion for a chameleon field and compared them with the exact numerical solutions of non  linear equations of motion and the analytical fit of the exact numerical solutions of non  linear equations of motion .",
    "the analytical fit of the exact numerical solutions is taken in the form reproducing in the vicinity of a mirror at @xmath173 the solutions eq.([eq:22 ] ) , coinciding with the solutions obtained in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath176 the accuracy of the analytical fit of the exact numerical solutions is better than @xmath181 .",
    ".  [ eq:87 ] may be used , for example , to calculate bounds on the coupling constant  @xmath2 by comparing the transition frequency  @xmath182 with its theoretical expectation  @xmath183 : _ ab - _ ab^theo = ( a | ( z ) | a - b | ( z ) | b ) . [ eq:90 ] such resonant transitions between quantum states of a neutron in the gravity potential have been measured by the qbounce collaboration @xcite .",
    "so far a chameleon field has been calculated in the infinitely large spatial region above a mirror , whereas the ultra - cold neutrons bounce in the gravitational field of the earth between two mirrors @xcite with a relative distance @xmath4 .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the non ",
    "linear eq.([eq:27 ] ) with @xmath184 admits non  linear solutions with a discontinuous derivative of a chameleon field .",
    "such solutions are equal to the solutions eq.([eq:20 ] ) with a replacement latexmath:[$z \\to    sign function @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath186 @xcite , the second derivative satisfies eq.([eq:28 ] ) with an additional term @xmath187 , where a dirac @xmath188function @xmath189 appears as a derivative of the sign function @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath191 is defined by a jump of the first derivative at @xmath192 , where @xmath193 has a dimension of surface density of scalar particle .",
    "the factor @xmath194 is introduced by analogy with electrostatic @xcite .",
    "an analogy between the chameleon field theory in the thin ",
    "shell regime and the electrostatic has been drawn in @xcite .    a deviation from eq.([eq:28 ] ) by the term @xmath195 might imply that the hamilton density of a chameleon field in the spatial region @xmath9 should be defined as follows [ eq:89 ] h(z ) = ( ) ^2 + v((z ) ) - 4(z ) ( z ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath196 can be unambiguously determined due to a self  interaction of a chameleon field .",
    "indeed , the hamilton density eq.([eq:89 ] ) defines the equation of motion eq.([eq:28 ] ) with the additional term @xmath197 . solving this equation for the regions @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively , we arrive at the solution eq.([eq:20 ] ) with a replacement @xmath200",
    "this gives @xmath201 .",
    "when the distance between two mirrors tends to infinity , the surface density @xmath193 vanishes and we arrive at the solutions for a chameleon field above ( below ) one mirror .    of course , we do not stand for the reality of such solutions due to a necessity to introduce an additional term @xmath202 to the hamilton density , an influence of which on the properties of a chameleon field is not clear .",
    "the solutions with a discontinuous derivative might be accepted as an artifact of the solutions of eq.([eq:27 ] ) .",
