    "one of the most important problems of rapidly developing branch of science quantum information theory @xcite is to determine whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled .",
    "we say that a given state @xmath3 acting on a finite dimensional product hilbert space @xmath4 is separable or classically correlated if it can be written as a convex linear combination of product density operators @xcite , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nonnegative coefficients fulfilling the condition @xmath9 .",
    "otherwise the state is called entangled or inseparable .",
    "an important necessary and sufficient criterion used to check the separability of a state was developed by the horodecki s @xcite .",
    "it applies the positive but not completely positive maps , precisely , it states that a density matrix @xmath3 is separable if and only if the operator @xmath10 is positive for all positive but not completely positive maps @xmath11 . even though making use of the criterion is not an easy task , together with the result of peres @xcite it provides a strong condition for separability , based on partial transposition .",
    "it says that @xmath3 is entangled if it has a nonpositive partial transposition . for low dimensional systems such as @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "this is also a sufficient criterion for separability @xcite , however , in general there exist states that have positive partial transposition ( ppt ) and simultaneously are entangled @xcite .",
    "such operators are certainly nondistillable @xcite and belong to the class of bound entangled ( be ) states .",
    "an interesting question is thus whether there exist classes of states ( except for @xmath12 and @xmath13 systems ) where partial transposition provides a necessary and sufficient test for separability .",
    "one could expect that invariance of states under certain group of symmetry would lead to some interesting results .",
    "such states have a relatively simple structure and therefore have been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown recently that positive partial transposition is a sufficient criterion in the case of @xmath14 rotationally invariant states @xcite and @xmath15 rotationally invariant states with integer total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "on the other hand in ref . @xcite it was shown that for @xmath16 rotationally invariant systems with even @xmath17 there always exist bound entangled states detected by certain map .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the separability of more general @xmath18 invariant states .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath19 systems with even @xmath20 and arbitrary @xmath2 and show that there is always a region in the ppt set where states are bound entangled proving , thus , that in such systems positive partial transposition is only a necessary condition for separability .",
    "we achieve this using a recently introduced positive indecomposable map @xmath21 given by eq.([mapphi ] ) @xcite .",
    "the map belongs to the class of indecomposable positive maps arising from the reduction criterion @xcite which was studied in detail by hall @xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath21 on a given operator @xmath22 from @xmath23 is such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the time reversal operation and @xmath26 is a @xmath27 identity matrix .",
    "the map @xmath21 is positive if @xmath28 is an even number and therefore leads to the following necessary condition for separability on @xmath0 hilbert space with even @xmath29 : @xmath30 we show that when applying the breuer s map to rotationally invariant states one can restrict to a family of operators invariant under partial time reversal . moreover the results obtained for @xmath31-invariant states can be extended to the ppt rotationally invariant states .",
    "we also show that in our case the set of states invariant under partial time reversal can be easily found and therefore it is possible to prove the existence of be states in higher dimensional rotationally invariant systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.ii ] we give a brief description of representations of @xmath18-invariant states and action of certain positive but not completely positive maps on this class of states . in sec .",
    "[ sec.iii ] we present a special case of @xmath32 and on the basis of this example analyze more general case @xmath33 with even @xmath34 and arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "in particular we show that to determine the set of be states detected by the breuer s map one can restrict to the subset of states invariant under partial time reversal and then extend the result to the set of ppt states .",
    "the results also suggest that the map ( [ mapphi ] ) could provide both necessary and sufficient separability criterion for states invariant under partial time reversal .",
    "assume that we are given a bipartite quantum state represented by a density matrix @xmath3 acting on a finite product hilbert space @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "the angular momenta of the particles are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the characterization of entanglement of such states is in general a difficult task .",
    "however , it simplifies when one impose some constraints on considered density matrices .",
    "hereafter we shall be assuming that @xmath3 is invariant under the action of @xmath18 group .",
    "more rigorously this assumption means that the following relation holds @xmath39=0\\ ] ] for all proper rotations @xmath40 from @xmath18 group . here",
    "@xmath41 denote the unitary irreducible representation of the @xmath18 group on the respective state spaces . in view of the shur s lemma",
    ", the states which obey the above condition , can be written in the following form @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the common eigenvectors of the square of total angular momentum operator and of its @xmath44-component .",
    "thus the set of rotationally invariant states is isomorphic to a proper subset of vectors @xmath45 from @xmath46 , which are nonnegative , i.e. , @xmath47 and fulfil the following normalization condition @xmath48 on the other hand , as proposed by breuer in refs .",
    "@xcite , each rotationally invariant state can be written as a combination of hermitian operators @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the components of an irreducible tensor operator @xcite .",
    "subscript @xmath51 is the rank of this tensor operator and @xmath52 takes on @xmath53 values , @xmath54 .",
    "the operators @xmath55 are rotationally invariant and form a complete set in the space of rotationally invariant states .",
    "thus any @xmath18 invariant state can be written as their linear combination , i.e. , @xmath56 like in the case of @xmath57 representation the state is uniquely characterized by a parameter vector @xmath58 .",
    "due to the fact that tensor operators @xmath59 are traceless for @xmath60 the normalization condition gives @xmath61 . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath62-dimensional vectors @xmath45 and @xmath63 are related by a linear transformation @xmath64 with matrix elements of the orthogonal matrix l given by @xmath65 the reason for introducing two different representations is their convenience for certain purposes .",
    "@xmath66-representation is suitable to determine the state space , whereas the operation of partial time reversal , unitarily equivalent to the partial transposition , can be performed much more easily in the @xmath67 basis .",
    "thus we apply the latter to identify the set of rotationally invariant states with positive partial time reversal which is the same as set of states that remain positive after partial transposition .      to determine the set of rotationally invariant ppt states ( from now on denoted by @xmath68 ) we apply a map unitarily equivalent to partial transposition , i.e. , the partial time reversal map @xcite .",
    "it is more useful in our case due to the fact that , unlike the partial transposition , it preserves the @xmath18 invariance of the state .",
    "the operation of partial time reversal acts as follows @xmath69 where @xmath25 is the time reversal map acting on a given operator @xmath22 as @xmath70 .",
    "here @xmath71 is a unitary rotation by the angle @xmath72 about the @xmath73-axis . as mentioned before , the action of partial time reversal operator is especially simple in the @xmath59 representation @xmath74 which follows directly from the relation @xmath75 and equation ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "let us recall one more property of @xmath76 map , i.e. , preservation of separability .",
    "it means that if @xmath3 is separable then @xmath77 is also separable .",
    "we apply this fact in the next section to prove the separability of certain ppt states .",
    "since the set of separable states is a subset of ppt states , one should have the condition unambiguously determining the separability of analyzed states . a method useful to identify the separable invariant states",
    "was developed in @xcite and is based on the action of a projection super - operator @xmath78 .",
    "the super - operator for @xmath18 group of symmetry , considered in this paper , projects each state onto a rotationally invariant state space as follows @xmath79 preserving the separability of a state .",
    "the last property allows us to identify the set of separable states @xmath80 with a convex linear combination of @xmath78-projections of pure normalized product states @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the projection onto the state @xmath84 . consequently to find separable states among ppt states",
    "it is enough to show that for the extreme points of @xmath80 ( denoted by @xmath85 ) there exist pure normalized product states satisfying relation @xmath86 .",
    "however to find the  suspected  extreme points @xmath85 one should have a criterion detecting at least some bound entanglement , so that one could look for separable states in a smaller set . in our case",
    "the map developed recently in @xcite proved to be especially useful .",
    "it leads to the necessary criterion ( [ b - op ] ) . using this criterion",
    "we show that the set of ppt rotationally invariant states for even @xmath87 always contains entangled states . to prove this it is enough to check the criterion on the subset of @xmath76-invariant states @xmath88 , \\quad \\varrho \\in \\mathcal{r}_{\\mathrm{ppt}},\\ ] ] since the action of breuer s map is the same for all states @xmath3 satisfying above equation and equivalent to @xmath89 in the second equality appearing in eq .",
    "( [ inv2 ] ) we make use of the fact that @xmath90 for all rotationally invariant states . as a result of the above relations we can simplify the criterion ( [ b - op ] ) to @xmath91 it automatically follows that if @xmath92 fulfils the criterion ( [ b - opinv ] ) then all @xmath3 s from equation ( [ t - inv ] ) satisfy ( [ b - op ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall consider rotationally invariant states in the context of bound entanglement . we show that in @xmath0 hilbert space with even @xmath62 and arbitrary @xmath93 there always exist ppt entangled states .    at the very beginning to provide some insight into the state space structure we focus on the case of the @xmath32 system , since it may be easily visualized in @xmath94 .",
    "let us now restrict our attention to the case of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and arbitrary @xmath98 from now on denoted by @xmath28 . in this paragraph we will also denote @xmath99 by @xmath100 .",
    "the total angular momentum of the system @xmath101 takes on the values @xmath102 and thus every rotationally invariant state is represented by 4 coordinates which satisfy the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath103 by the normalization condition the number of independent parameters @xmath104 describing a state can be reduced to 3 . in order to characterize this set of rotationally invariant states we need to find its extreme points in @xmath45 space .",

    "( [ lmatrix ] ) . in the considered case of @xmath32",
    "the transformation matrix is of the form @xmath109 at the same time we observe , that the 4-dimensional vectors @xmath63 are unambiguously characterized by three coordinates since @xmath110 for all rotationally invariant density matrices .",
    "this allows us to restrict our considerations to the three parameters @xmath111 and visualize all considered sets in @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath108 transformation carried on the extreme points gives us the vertices of the tetrahedron in the space of parameters @xmath111 as follows @xmath113 @xmath114     ( tetrahedron @xmath115 ) , its image under partial time reversal @xmath116 , and intersection of the sets @xmath117 for various values of @xmath100 , namely @xmath118 ( left upper ) , @xmath119 ( right upper ) , @xmath120 ( left lower ) , @xmath121 ( right lower ) . the ppt region becomes larger with the growth of dimension of the second subsystem and the ppt criterion fails to detect many entangled states with the growth of asymmetry between the dimensions of subsystems.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    now we can find the image of the tetrahedron @xmath115 under the action of @xmath31 .",
