    "the evolution and maintenance of sexual replication is one of the central questions in modern evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "the theories with the broadest acceptance are that sex allows for the removal of deleterious mutations from a population @xcite , or that sex allows for faster adaptation in dynamic environments @xcite .",
    "as has been noted in previous studies @xcite , the various theories for the existence of sex are incomplete , in that they do not explain why some organisms are obligately sexual , while other organisms either alternate between asexual and sexual replication , or are asexual replicators with some ability for recombination with other organisms .    in a recent set of papers @xcite , tannenbaum , fontanari , and lee studied the competition between asexual and sexual replicators in various regimes .",
    "two of the models consider single - celled organisms , that replicate by dividing into haploids .",
    "these haploids then enter a haploid pool , where they fuse with other haploids .",
    "the resulting diploid then divides through the normal mitotic process .",
    "two other models were developed to be more appropriate for modeling multicellular organisms , which release either asexual spores or gametes . here , we considered the case where the population produces identical gametes , and where the population produces distinct sperm and egg gametes .    for both sets of models it was found that sexual replication is favored in slowly replicating organisms and high population densities . for the case of multicellular organisms , it was found that distinct sperm and egg gametes were necessary to maintain a selective advantage for sexual replication over asexual replication @xcite .    in all the models considered",
    ", the authors assumed that there is a time cost for sex , due to the time it takes for a given haploid to find another haploid with which to fuse .",
    "when the time cost for sex is low , then the selective advantage for sex outweighs the fitness penalty .",
    "once the time cost for sex becomes sufficiently large , the selective advantage for sex no longer outweighs the fitness penalty , and asexual replication becomes the preferred replication strategy .    in order to facilitate an exact analysis of the models , the authors made a number of simplifiying assumptions",
    ": it was assumed that the organisms have diploid genomes consisting of only two chromosomes , and that each chromosome is only considered functional , or viable , if it is equal to some master sequence .",
    "it was also assumed that the fitness of the organisms is determined by the number of viable chromosomes in the genome ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , and that organisms with two defective chromosomes have zero fitness .",
    "finally , one of the key simplifications that was made in the sexual replication models was the assumption that only haploids with viable chromosomes can fuse with one another .",
    "the reasoning behind this selective mating strategy was that haploids with defective chromosomes are not viable , and simply can not participate further in the replication process .",
    "while the assumption of a selective mating strategy is the easiest one to study , and while it is broadly consistent with the observation that organisms do engage in mate selection , it is nevertheless an overly restrictive assumption that must be relaxed if one wants to develop more realistic sexual replication models .",
    "the reason for this is that it is impossible , in practice , for one organism to read another organism s genome .",
    "even if this were possible , the correlation between the genome sequence and fitness is extremely difficult to obtain .",
    "organisms that engage in mate selection look for certain behaviors and physical attributes , known as _ indicator traits _ , that suggest that the given organism has a good genome @xcite . however , the map from such traits to genome is not exact .",
    "furthermore , the more accuracy one wants in assessing the fitness of an organism , the more time one has to spend studying the organism . for",
    ", if assessing the fitness of an organism is equivalent to reading its genome , then the more accuracy one wants , the more of the genome that has to be read .",
    "therefore , a selective mating strategy has an additional time cost over other mating strategies , leading to a fitness penalty that may eliminate the advantage for sexual replication entirely .",
    "this time cost was not explicitly considered in previous studies .",
    "even if the time cost for a selective mating strategy were explicitly considered , we have shown that there will always be an uncertainly as to the exact fitness of the organism . as a result ,",
    "more realistic models for sexual replication need to consider mating strategies that take into account the uncertainty that one organism has of another s fitness .",
    "otherwise , the conclusions that we have drawn regarding the selective advantage for sex are open to the criticism that they are based on an unrealistic and overly restrictive mating strategy .    in this paper ,",
    "we take the opposite extreme from a selective mating strategy , and consider sexual replication with a random mating strategy .",
    "that is , we assume that all haploids participate in the replication process , and fuse with one another at random .",
    "as long as the cost for sex is negligible , we find that , even with this non - selective mating strategy , the mean fitness for a sexually replicating population is greater than that of the corresponding asexually replicating population . nevertheless , if the time cost associated with the selective mating strategy is negligible as well , then the mean fitness of the selective mating strategy is greater than that of the random mating strategy , independent of the cost for sex . as the cost for sex increases , sexual replication via either the selective or random mating strategies only outcompetes asexual replication over progressively smaller ranges of replication fidelities , and ceases to be advantageous entirely once the cost for sex crosses a threshold value .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section ( section ii ) , we develop and analyze the mutation - selection equations appropriate for analyzing an asexually replicating , two - chromosomed , diploid population . in section iii",
    ", we develop the mutation - selection equations appropriate for analyzing the sexually replicating analogue of the population considered in section ii .",
    "we consider both selective and random mating strategies .",
    "although the selective mating strategy has already been studied , we review it here for the sake of completeness and consistency of notation . in section iv , we compare all three replication strategies , and show that a random mating strategy outcompetes asexual replication when the cost for sex is negligible .",
    "we also show that when the cost of implementing the selective mating strategy is negligible , then the selective mating strategy outcompetes the random mating strategy , independently of the cost for sex .",
    "section v is the discussion , where we review and discuss the implications of our results . finally , in section vi we conclude the paper with a summary of the main results of the paper , as well as our plans for future research .",
    "we consider a population of unicellular organisms whose genomes consist of two chromosomes .",
    "we assume that a given chromosome , denoted @xmath4 , is functional if and only if it is equal to some  master \" , or wild - type , chromosome @xmath0 .",
    "assuming first - order exponential growth , we then assume that the fitness , or first - order growth rate constant , of a given genome is determined by whether the genome consists of zero , one , or two functional chromosomes . to this end , we let @xmath5 denote the first - order growth rate constant of organisms with two functional , or equivalently , viable chromosomes . we let @xmath6 denote the first - order growth rate constant of organisms with one functional and one non - functional ( unviable ) chromosome . finally , we let @xmath7 denote the first - order growth rate constant of organisms with two non - functional chromosomes .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath9 , which makes sense , since an organism with two defective chromosomes is not expected to grow .",
    "we also define @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we now divide the populations into three subpopulations : we let @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the number of organisms with two , one , and zero viable chromosomes .",
    "we let @xmath15 be the total number of organisms , so that @xmath16 .",
    "the population fractions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19",
    "are then defined via @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .    to develop the mutation - selection equations describing the evolutionary dynamics of the asexually replicating equations",
    ", we assume that the replication of each cell occurs as follows : the two chromosomes line up along the center of the cell and replicate ( see figure 1 ) . because replication is in general not error - free ,",
    "we let @xmath23 denote the probability that a given genome is replicated correctly .",
    "if the genome is sufficiently long , then the probability that a mutation will occur in a previously mutated region of the genome is negligible , so that an unviable chromosome produces an unviable daughter with probability @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is known as the _ neglect of backmutations_.    we also let @xmath24 denote a co - segregation parameter , which is simply the probability that a parent chromosome co - segregates with the other parent chromosome in the cell .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the various parent cell configurations and the final daughter cell configurations , along with their associated probabilities .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath25 is the same as the @xmath26 parameter defined in @xcite .    with these definitions in hand ,",
    "we may develop expressions for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "changing variables from population numbers to population fractions , we obtain the mutation - selection equations ,    @xmath30 x_{vv } \\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\frac{d x_{vu}}{dt } = [ \\kappa_{vu } p - \\bar{\\kappa}(t ) ] x_{vu } + 2 b_{vv } \\kappa_{vv } x_{vv } \\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\frac{d x_{uu}}{dt } = [ \\kappa_{uu } - \\bar{\\kappa}(t ) ] x_{uu } + ( 1 - p ) \\kappa_{vu } x_{vu }   \\nonumber \\\\ &   & + s ( 1 - p)^2 \\kappa_{vv } x_{vv } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 , and , @xmath32 \\nonumber \\\\ &   & b_{vv } = [ 1 - p ] [ 1 - s ( 1 - p)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quantity @xmath33 is the mean fitness of the population , since it measures the first - order growth rate of the population as a whole . in order to determine which replication strategy is advantageous in a given regime , we compare the steady - state mean fitnesses of the populations employing the various strategies .",
    "the population with the largest mean fitness will drive the others to extinction , and so the corresponding replication strategy is the advantageous one .",
    "from quasispecies theory , it may be shown that the above system of equations converges to a steady - state , and that the steady - state mean fitness is given by @xmath34 , assuming that @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this implies that there exists a @xmath35 $ ] such that @xmath36 for @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "if we define @xmath40 , then we have that @xmath41 for @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath42 for @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath43 is defined by the equality @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is simply the steady - state mean fitness of the asexual population , normalized by the fitness of the wild - type , @xmath5 .",
    "when we analyze the sexual replication models , we will also work with the normalized mean fitnesses , as it will prove convenient to do so . when comparing the various replication strategies , the strategy with the largest normalized mean fitness at steady - state is the one that will outcompete the others for the given set of parameters .",
    "the general sexual replication model we are considering is illustrated in figure 2 : a diploid cell grows to mature size , with a first - order growth rate constant given by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath9 , depending on whether the genome has two , one , or zero functional chromosomes , respectively .",
    "the mature diploid then divides into two haploids , which enter a haploid pool . the haploids fuse with one another , and the resulting diploids",
    "then immediately divide via the normal mitotic process .",
    "it should be noted that the corresponding first - order growth rate constants for the asexual and sexual populations are taken to be equal , since the first - order growth rate constants measure the characteristic time it takes a diploid to double in size before dividing .    with sexual replication",
    ", it is necessary to keep track of the haploid as well as the diploid population .",
    "therefore , in addition to the quantities @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 defined in the previous section , we also have the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , corresponding to the number of viable and unviable haploids , respectively .",
    "the haploid fusion process is modeled as a binary collision reaction characterized by second - order rate constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , corresponding to the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 haploid collisions .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath48 and @xmath50 are defined so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the rates of disappearance of the @xmath56 haploids and @xmath57 haploids respectively , due to @xmath51 and @xmath53 haploid fusion respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is defined so that @xmath58 is the rate of disappearance of either the @xmath56 haploids or the @xmath57 haploids due to @xmath52 haploid fusion .",
    "we also assume that the system volume increases so as to maintain a constant density of genomes in the population .",
    "that is , if @xmath59 denotes the volume of the system , then we assume that @xmath60/v $ ] is constant .",
    "we now make the following definitions : we define @xmath16 to be the total population of diploids , and @xmath61 to be the mean fitness of the diploid population .",
    "we define the population ratios @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we define a diploid density @xmath64 .",
    "if we write down the differential equations governing the values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then changing variables to the population ratios gives the mutation - selection equations ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and where we have defined the additional quantities @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 via , @xmath70",
    "although we are defining the mean fitness of the population with respect to the diploid organisms , at steady - state any two mean fitnesses defined with respect to two distinct sets of subpopulations will be equal .",
    "the reason for this is that , at steady - state , the population reaches a mutation - selection balance , so that any two given sets of subpopulations will be in a fixed proportion to one another ( e.g. the total diploid population versus the total population ) .",
    "therefore , the per capita rate of increase of one subpopulation is equal to the per capita rate of increase of another .    as a result , there is no ambiguity as to which sexual mean fitness to use when comparing whether a given sexual population outcompetes another sexual population , or an asexual population .",
    "the selective mating strategy is defined by @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that only the @xmath56 haploids are allowed to mate , while the @xmath57 haploids are essentially thrown away .",
    "one justification for this mating strategy is that the @xmath57 haploids contain defective genomes , and so are simply physically incapable of participating further in the replication process .",
    "another justification , one that is likely more relevant to actual organisms , is that the @xmath56 haploids have a way of determining the fitness of a potential haploid mate ( via  indicator \" traits , for example ) , and choose to only mate with the fittest haploids .    for the selective mating strategy ,",
    "the steady - state equations are given by , @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we purposely neglect the steady - state equation corresponding to @xmath75 , since this equation will not be necessary to determine the mean fitness of the population .",

    "however , because sexual replication when there is no cost for sex will outcompete an asexual replication when @xmath166 , it follows that if the cost for sex is sufficiently low , then below a certain value of @xmath23 a sexual population will outcompete the asexual population . presumably , the higher the cost for sex , the smaller @xmath23 must be before the selective advantage for sexual replication is sufficiently large to outweigh the cost .",
    "this behavior only persists up to a maximal cost for sex , beyond which asexual replication outcompetes sexual replication at all replication fidelities .",
    "the reason for this is that the sexual and asexual mean fitnesses converge to @xmath1 as @xmath242 . as a result ,",
    "once the cost for sex is sufficiently high , the fitness advantage of the sexual strategy for the values of @xmath23 where the sexual strategy can outcompete the asexual strategy is too small to overcome the cost for sex .    indeed , from eq .",

    "finally , once the replication fidelity becomes sufficiently low , the asexual population again outcompetes the sexual population .    based on this analysis",

    "figure 5 shows a plot of the regions for the selective advantages of the various replication strategies as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "although we have shown that a selective mating strategy will outcompete a random strategy , this analysis is based on the assumption that a selective mating strategy is not inherently slower than a random mating strategy .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this is in general not true , since there is a time cost associated with determining the genome of a potential haploid mate .",
    "this time cost leads to an additional fitness cost associated with a selective mating strategy that is not incurred by a random mating strategy .",
    "when the replication fidelity is either sufficiently high or sufficiently low , then the benefits of a selective mating strategy are not sufficient to overcome the fitness costs , and so the random mating strategy dominates . however , at intermediate replication fidelities , the selective mating strategy may indeed outcompete the random mating strategy , assuming that the fitness cost associated with selective mating is not too high .",
    "once the fitness cost associated with selective mating becomes sufficiently high , then the random mating strategy may outcompete the selective mating strategy at all replication fidelities .    in summary , when the time cost for a selective mating strategy is taken into account",

    "this paper developed a set of simplified models describing asexual and sexual replication in a unicellular population consisting of two - chromosomed , diploid genomes .",
    "we considered two types of sexual replication strategies : a selective mating strategy , where only viable haploids are allowed to fuse , and a random mating strategy , where all haploids are allowed to participate in the replication process .",
    "we assumed that haploid fusion was a second - order rate process .",
    "we found that , when the cost for sex is negligible , both the selective and random mating strategies lead to a greater mean fitness than asexual replication .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the selective mating strategy has a higher mean fitness than the random mating strategy , as long as the additional fitness penalty associated with a selective mating strategy is negligible .",
    "further analysis suggested that sexual replication for both the selective and random mating strategies is favored at intermediate mutation rates , and when the cost for sex is sufficiently low .",
    "once the cost for sex becomes sufficiently high , the selective advantage for sexual replication disappears entirely .",
    "the results of this paper therefore suggest that sex is favored in slowly replicating organisms and high population densities . while this is consistent with previous studies @xcite , what is interesting is that this result holds even with a random mating strategy .    for future work , we will consider models where it is not necessarily true that @xmath9 , but rather we will allow for positive values of @xmath7 .",
    "this will make our model more consistent with quasispecies models that often assume a small , but positive growth rate for organisms with defective genomes .",
    "furthermore , although our model provides results that are broadly consistent with actual organismal behavior , we have nevertheless worked with a highly simplified sexual replication model that does not exactly correspond to the sexual replication pathway employed by unicellular organisms .    in our model",
    ", a mature diploid divides into two haploids , the haploids fuse , and then the resulting diploid divides into two cells .",
    "thus , the diploid mitosis occurs _",
    "after _ haploid fusion .",
    "by contrast , in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ( baker s yeast ) , for example , a mature diploid divides into two diploids , which then divide into four haploids .",
    "the haploids then fuse , and the resulting diploids grow to maturity to begin the process again .",
    "thus , for yeast , diploid mitosis occurs _ before _",
    "haploid fusion .",
    "we suspect that the relative positions of the diploid mitosis and haploid fusion stages in a sexual replication cycle can affect the mutation - selection balance , and so we would like to develop more realistic models corresponding to the sexual replication pathways in actual unicellular organisms .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that we believe that the central results of this paper will hold even when we consider a somewhat different sexual replication pathway .",
