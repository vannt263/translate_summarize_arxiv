    "<S> topological insulators are guaranteed to support metallic surface states on an insulating bulk , and one should thus expect that the electronic transport in these materials is dominated by the surfaces states . alas , due to the high remaining bulk conductivity , surface contributions to transport have so - far only been singled out indirectly via quantum oscillations @xcite , or for devices based on gated and doped topological insulator thin films , a situation in which the surface carrier mobility could be limited by defect and interface scattering @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first direct measurement of surface - dominated conduction on an atomically clean surface of bulk - insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath0se . using nano - scale four point setups with variable contact distance </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the transport at 30  k is two - dimensional rather than three - dimensional and by combining these measurements with angle - resolved photoemission results from the same crystals , we find a surface state mobility of 390(30 )  @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 at 30  k at a carrier concentration of 8.71(7)@xmath3  @xmath4 .    the most significant hurdle for reaching surface - dominated transport in a topological insulator ( ti ) </S>",
    "<S> is currently believed to be the high conductivity of the underlying bulk . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , most bulk tis have a small band gap , are degenerately @xmath5-doped , and/or suffer from poor screening of impurities @xcite . only recently , materials with a semiconducting temperature dependence of the bulk resistivity @xmath6 have been synthesised @xcite . while the high bulk conductance is a well - recognised issue , it is by no means obvious that the surface conductance would be very high . </S>",
    "<S> for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) edge state of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ti ( the quantum spin hall effect ) , the spin texture provides a protection from back scattering and since this is the only possible scattering process in 1d , perfect quantum transport results at low temperature @xcite . for a 2d surface state , backscattering is still forbidden but other scattering processes are not , such that transport could be strongly affected by impurity scattering and , at finite temperature , also by electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the heavy elements in the topological insulators typically lead to a low debye temperature , increasing the significance of phonon scattering @xcite . achieving the regime of surface - dominated conductance and quantifying </S>",
    "<S> the surface mobility is therefore an important goal of the field .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> the direct measurement of surface transport is achieved by combining high - quality bulk - insulating crystals of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se @xcite with four point transport measurements on the clean surface in ultrahigh vacuum and on a variable length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the transport measurements shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> typically , transport measurements were performed on large areas free of atomic steps ( with lateral dimensions @xmath7  </S>",

    "<S> the data points at 300  k have been collected with the 12pp whereas the 30  k data points have been measured with the 4stm . at 300  k </S>",
    "<S> , the four point resistance @xmath10 is observed to be inversely proportional to the contact distance @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is characteristic for four point measurements measurements on a 3d bulk crystal , where we expect that @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the bulk conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the red line through the data points shows the expected four point probe resistance at room temperature , based on a macroscopic bulk resistivity measurement on the same crystal ( see fig . [ fig:1](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the agreement is excellent and we find no indication of surface transport .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is entirely different for the measurements taken at 30  k. here the measured @xmath10 is approximately independent of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> such a behaviour is expected for pure 2d conductance where one finds that @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the 2d the sheet conductance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume the total four point resistance to be the contribution of surface and bulk in parallel , i.e. @xmath16 , it thus appears that bulk transport contribution is negligible at this temperature . when taking the average resistance at 30  k ( dashed black line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) ) , we obtain a sheet conductance of @xmath17  @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> again , we can calculate the expected behaviour for bulk - dominated transport . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) we find the bulk resistivity at 30  k to be @xmath19 cm , consistent with the highest values reported in the literature @xcite , and two orders of magnitude higher than at 300  k. using this value , a calculation of the expected bulk behaviour results in the blue line . </S>",
    "<S> the four point resistance can clearly not be reconciled with bulk behaviour , not only because of the wrong dependence on the contact spacing , but also because the surface is much more conductive at small contact spacings than expected for the bulk solid . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the blue line crosses the constant of the dashed line through the data points for a spacing of @xmath20  @xmath8 m . </S>",
    "<S> one should therefore expect a transition to bulk - dominated behaviour around this spacing but such a trend is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - dominated transport is seen to persist to the largest measured spacing of @xmath21  @xmath8 m , suggesting that the actual bulk resistivity of the underlying sample _ in the probed surface area _ is larger than the value obtained from the macroscopic resistivity measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is quite likely that a macroscopic measurement for a not perfectly homogeneous sample @xcite will tend to give an average resistivity that is dominated by percolated regions of low resistance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the surface region for the microscopic measurements was deliberately chosen to avoid areas with steps , impurity clusters or other irregularities . </S>",
    "<S> since the data shows no sign of a deviation from the constant resistance even at the largest spacings ( @xmath21  @xmath8 m ) , we conclude that the local bulk resistivity is at least one order of magnitude higher than that obtained from the bulk measurement .    in order to determine the surface state mobility from the sheet resistance , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to know the carrier concentration in the surface state . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the surface electronic structure of the bi@xmath0te@xmath0se is determined by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) show the results of such a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra clearly show the existence of the topological surface state with the dirac point at a binding energy of approximately @xmath22  mev and a considerable hexagonal warping of the constant energy contour at the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the distance from the hexagon s edges to the centre is found to be @xmath23  @xmath2 , corresponding to a density of @xmath24 electrons per cm@xmath9 . from this and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 determined above , we can evaluate the carrier mobility to be 390(30 )  @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> apart from the obvious reason of increased electron - phonon scattering at the higher temperature here ( 30  k instead of 1.6  k for the bi@xmath0te@xmath0se results in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the lower mobility could be caused by the higher carrier density ( @xmath24 instead of @xmath28 in ref . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , we find bi@xmath0te@xmath0se surfaces to be much less sensitive to contamination - induced band bending than bi@xmath0se@xmath27 surfaces and no 2deg formation is observed , unless the surface is doped with alkali atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2d character of the four point resistance @xmath10 at 30  k appears to rule out a significant contribution to the conductance from bulk states and we can support this by further observations . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) shows scanning tunnelling spectra , taken with one of the tips of the 4stm at 30  k and 300  k , around 4  hours after cleaving the sample . while distinct signatures of the topological states are typically difficult to identify in such spectra , similar to the situation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is clear that the fermi energy at the surface is placed well within the bulk band gap and the bulk states are therefore not expected to contribute significantly to the observed transport . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the in - gap differential conductance at 30  k is much lower than at 300  k , consistent with the resistivity change over this temperature range .    </S>",
    "<S> a time - dependent near - surface band bending can be expected to increase the bulk carrier density near the surface and hence the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> however , we could not observe any systematic time - dependence of the measured @xmath31 within the first 30  hours after the cleave . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , no such change could be observed even when intentionally contaminating the surface with carbon monoxide at a partial pressure of @xmath32  mbar for two hours . from this </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that while a band bending might be present , the contribution of bulk states to the transport is still negligible . </S>",
    "<S> there are two factors explaining this : the band bending - induced carrier density is substantially smaller than that from the topological state and it is likely that the bulk states suffer from stronger scattering than the surface states .    in conclusion , we have reported a direct surface - state dominated transport measurement on the clean surface of bulk - insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath0se . </S>",
    "<S> the surface mobility is found to be high , 390(30 )  @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , at the measurement temperature of 30  k. reaching the surface - dominated transport regime has been possible by the combination of a nano - scale four point probe technique with high - quality bulk crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the bulk resistivity in a carefully chosen region of the crystal may significantly exceed the value measured from a macroscopic bulk crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising in view of the fluctuations of physical properties observed in large bulk crystals @xcite and it suggests that pushing surface - dominated transport towards room temperature could be an achievable goal . </S>"
