    "our second main technical innovation is to obtain efficient numerical methods for solving this variational problem for small values of the dimension @xmath28 , as well as sharpened asymptotics in the case of large values of @xmath28 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . after some notational preliminaries , we recall in section [ dist - sec ] the known ( or conjectured ) distributional estimates on primes in arithmetic progressions that we will need to prove theorem [ main ] .",
    "then , in section [ subclaim - sec ] , we give the key propositions that will be combined together to establish this theorem .",
    "one of these propositions , lemma [ crit ] , is an easy application of the pigeonhole principle .",
    "two further propositions , theorem [ prime - asym ] and theorem [ nonprime - asym ] , use the prime distribution results from section [ dist - sec ] to give asymptotics for certain sums involving sieve weights and the von mangoldt function ; they are established in section [ sieving - sec ] .",
    "theorems [ maynard - thm ] , [ maynard - trunc ] , [ epsilon - trick ] , [ epsilon - beyond ] use the asymptotics established in theorems [ prime - asym ] , [ nonprime - asym ] , in combination with lemma [ crit ] , to give various criteria for bounding @xmath1 , which all involve finding sufficiently strong candidates for a variety of multidimensional variational problems ; these theorems are proven in section [ variational - sec ] .",
