    "in summary , we have studied the effect of a magnetic s gauge field on a topological fermionic band insulator by considering a generalization of haldane s model of the anomalous hall insulator to models with an arbitrary chern number .",
    "we have shown that a spinless system becomes metallic under a weak magnetic field , unless other physical effects , such as disorder , are taken into account . however , in some model systems a stronger magnetic field can induce an insulating phase .",
    "we have also addressed the effect of a weak square superlattice potential on the ll splitting and hall conductance of high chern number systems . in the case of the @xmath9 quantum spin hall insulator with @xmath85 conservation , the magnetic field s vector potential induces a finite magnetization even without considering the zeeman coupling .",
    "this magnetized quantum hall state is unstable with respect to spin - flip perturbations ( including spin - orbit terms ) .",
