    "the extragalactic diffuse background emission ( egrb ) is a superposition of all unresolved sources of high energy emission in the universe .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the dominant class of emitters known to emit up to the highest energies .",
    "there is a consensus that a population of unresolved agn may contribute to the egrb , however predictions range from 25% up to 100% .",
    "contributions from other extragalactic sources have been plausibly suggested : galaxy clusters @xcite , energetic particles in the shock waves associated with large scale cosmological structure formation @xcite , or distant burst events .",
    "potentially , if reliably derived , the egrb  can also provide important information about the phase of baryon - antibaryon annihilation @xcite , evaporation of primordial black holes @xcite , annihilation of so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite , and extragalactic ir and optical photon spectra @xcite .",
    "the egrb  is the component of the diffuse emission which is most difficult to determine .",
    "its spectrum depends much on the adopted model of the galactic background which itself is not yet firmly established . the isotropic , presumably extragalactic component of the diffuse  flux was first discovered by the sas-2 satellite and confirmed by egret @xcite . however , it is not correct to assume that the isotropic component is wholly extragalactic since even at the galactic poles it is comparable to the galactic contribution from inverse compton scattering of the galactic plane photons and cmb @xcite .",
    "the determination of the egrbis thus model - dependent and influenced by the adopted size of the galactic halo , the electron spectrum there , and the spectrum of low - energy background photons which must be derived independently .",
    "extensive work has been done @xcite to derive the spectrum of the egrb  based on egret data .",
    "the relation of modelled galactic diffuse emission to total measured diffuse emission was used to determine the egrb , as the extrapolation to zero galactic contribution .",
    "the derived spectral index @xmath0 appears to be close to that of blazars .",
    "@xcite , using an model - independent approach , also concluded that the egrb  will be affected by a significant contribution from a galactic halo component .    in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we use the galprop code to infer a new model for galactic diffuse continuum @xmath1-rays .",
    "this model reproduces successfully diffuse emission from the entire sky and gives a good linear prediction for observed vs.  predicted intensities . in view of the success of this model , we use it as the basis of a new determination of the egrb  using egret data from 30 mev to 50 gev .",
    "the galprop propagation code and previous results are described elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the details of the procedure of handling the egret data and convolution procedure are described in detail elsewhere @xcite ; here we provide a brief summary .",
    "we use the egret counts and exposure all - sky maps in galactic coordinates with 0.5@xmath2 binsize , as in @xcite .",
    "the sources of the 3eg catalogue have been removed by the procedure described in @xcite , fully consistent with the 3eg point source listings .",
    "apart from the most intense sources , the removal of sources has little influence on the comparison with models if sufficiently large sky segments are investigated . for the spectra ,",
    "the statistical errors on the egret data points are very small since the regions chosen have large solid angle ; the systematic error dominates and we have adopted values in the range 1030% depending on energy as shown in table  [ estimates_of_eb ] , cf .  15% adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the predicted model skymaps are convolved with the egret point - spread function as described in @xcite . here",
    "we use additional egret data in the energy ranges 1020 , 2050 and 50120 gev . because the instrumental response of egret determined at energies above 10 gev is less certain compared to energies below 10 gev , it is required to account for additional systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular the egret effective area can only be deduced by extrapolation from the calibrated effective area at lower energies @xcite .",
    "we accordingly adopt values of 0.9 , 0.8 , and 0.7 times the 410 gev effective area , respectively .",
    "in the companion paper @xcite we compared a range of models of _ galactic _ diffuse emission , based on our cr propagation code galprop , with data from the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "there we exploit the fact that the models predict quite specific behaviour for different sky regions and this provides a critical test : the `` correct '' model should be consistent with the data in _ all _ directions .",
    "we show that a new model , with moderate changes of electron and nucleon spectra relative to the `` conventional '' model , can well reproduce the data and is compatible with locally observed particle spectra considering the expected level of spatial fluctuations in the galaxy .",
    "the data comparisons were extended over the entire sky and to 100 gev in energy .",
    "we also exploited the recent improved measurements of the local proton , helium , as well as antiproton , and positron spectra which are used as constraints on the proton spectrum in distant regions .    to fit the galactic diffuse emission we used 7 test regions covering the sky ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the model uses the proton ( and he ) spectral shape at high energies derived from the local data .",
    "the secondary antiproton and positron data tracing the _ proton _ spectrum on a large scale provide an important constraint on the _ intensity _ normalization of the _ average _ spectrum .",
    "the adopted _ average electron _ spectrum resembles the local one renormalized upwards by a factor of @xmath34 and consistent with synchrotron index measurements .",
    "the adopted electron and nucleon spectra are compatible with the direct measurement considering fluctuations due to energy losses and the stochastic character of cosmic ray sources and propagation .",
    "the optimized model fits the observed galactic diffuse spectra in all test regions in the energy range 30 mev ",
    "the proposed scenario implies a substantial contribution from ic at all energies , but especially below 100 mev and above 1 gev .",
    "also ic dominates at latitudes @xmath4 at all energies .",
    "the agreement of longitude profiles with the egret data is generally good considering that the model does not attempt to include details of galactic structure .",
    "the agreement of latitude profiles with egret is also good , in particular the reproduction of the high - latitude variation confirms the importance of the ic component which is much broader than the gas - related @xmath5-decay  and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the outer galaxy latitude profiles are in excellent agreement with the data .                   since despite its success",
    "the model is nevertheless not exact the best approach is to fit the observed intensities with a free scaling factor , so that the egrb  is determined as the intercept , thus removing any residual uncertainty in the absolute level of the galactic components .",
    "this is the same method as in @xcite , the difference lies in the model . to reduce the effects of galactic structure , point sources etc .",
    "the fits are made excluding the plane , using the sky region @xmath6 ; ideally both ic and gas - related components would be left free but they are difficult to separate statistically at high latitudes , so we make a linear fit to the total ic+@xmath5-decay+bremsstrahlung , with the scaling factor and egrb  as parameters . the fit and errors are based on a simple @xmath7 analysis , with ( @xmath8 ) bins @xmath9 to obtain sufficient statistics ( at least 10 counts per bin were required ) . for comparison",
    "we also made fits to the entire sky ; in this case ic and gas - related contributions are easily separated , so that fits with both components free can be made in addition to fits to the total .",
    "the fits in the two regions then give some indication of the model - dependent systematic error in our egrb  estimates .",
