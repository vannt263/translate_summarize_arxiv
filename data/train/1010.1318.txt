    "the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , a spectroscopic phenomenon that occurs during stellar eclipses , has recently been used to study spin - orbit alignment for transiting exoplanets .",
    "although the first 9 published results suggested that the orbits of close - in planets are all well - aligned with the equatorial planes of their parent stars ( fabrycky & winn 2009 ) , the next 20 results were more diverse , including orbits highly inclined with respect to the star s equatorial plane ( see , e.g. , hbrard et al .",
    "2008 , winn et al .",
    "2009a , johnson et al .  2009 ) and even retrograde orbits ( anderson et al .",
    "2010 , narita et al .",
    "2009 , winn et al .  2009b ; triaud et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "these results have been marshalled as evidence against the standard scenario for planet migration , in which disk - planet tidal interactions cause the planet to spiral inward .",
    "instead the results suggest that many close - in giant planets arrived at their current locations through gravitational perturbations from other massive bodies , followed by tidal dissipation ( triaud et al .",
    "2010 , winn et al .",
    "2010a , matsumura et al .  2010 ) .",
    "another possibility is that protoplanetary disks are frequently misaligned with the rotation of their host stars ( bate et al .",
    "2010 , lai et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "recently , a possible trend emerged from the results : misaligned systems tend to have stars with effective temperatures exceeding about 6250  k , or masses @xmath21.2  @xmath3 .",
    "the evidence for this pattern is based not only on rm observations ( winn et al .",
    "2010a ) but also on the line - of - sight stellar rotation velocities of transit hosts ( schlaufman 2010 ) .",
    "this trend may indicate that planet formation and migration are fundamentally different for low - mass stars than for high - mass stars , for which there is already evidence in the distributions of planet mass and period ( bowler et al .",
    "another possibility is that the formation and migration processes are similar , but that the subsequent tidal evolution is different ( winn et al .",
    "in this hypothesis , cool stars are observed to have low obliquities because tidal evolution drove them into alignment , while hot stars retain their `` primordial '' obliquities because of their thinner ( or absent ) outer convection zones and consequently slower rates of tidal dissipation .",
    "although the trend seems clear , it is difficult to assess its true significance because many possible variables were examined before alighting on stellar temperature and mass .",
    "the only way to be sure is to gather more data .",
    "this paper presents results for the next two systems we observed after the trend had been identified .",
    "both systems have short - period giant planets , but hat - p-4 is `` cool '' ( @xmath4  k ; kovcs et al .  2007 ) while hat - p-14 is `` hot '' ( @xmath5  k ; torres et al .",
    "we present the observations of these systems in   2 , the analysis and results in   3 , and a discussion in   4 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations employed the high resolution spectrograph ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) of the keck  i 10 m telescope , on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we gathered 35 spectra of hat - p-4 on the night of 2010  march  29/30 , and 44 spectra of hat - p-14 on the night of 2010  april  27/28 , in both cases spanning a predicted transit of the planet .",
    "an additional 14 spectra of hat - p-4 were gathered on other nights , at essentially random orbital phases .",
    "we used the standard instrument settings and observing procedures of the california planet search ( howard et al .",
    "the iodine gas absorption cell was used to track the instrumental response and wavelength scale .",
    "the relative radial velocity ( rv ) of each spectrum was measured with respect to an iodine - free template spectrum , using a descendant of the algorithm of butler et al .",
    "measurement errors were estimated from the scatter among the fits to individual spectral segments spanning a few angstroms .",
    "tables  [ tbl : rv - hat14 ] and [ tbl : rv - hat4 ] give the rvs , including re - reductions of data presented earlier by kovcs et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "we also conducted photometric observations of hat - p-4 , in order to refine the transit ephemeris and other system parameters .",
    "we observed the transit of 2010  march  29/30 ( the same night as the keck observations ) with the faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) 2 m telescope , on mauna haleakala , hawaii .",
    "we used the spectral instruments camera with an sdss @xmath6 filter and @xmath7 binning , giving a pixel scale of @xmath8 and a @xmath9 field of view .",
    "unfortunately the guider malfunctioned that night .",
    "the transit of 2010  may  7/8 was observed with the fred l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2 m telescope on mt.hopkins , arizona .",
    "we used keplercam with an sdss @xmath6 filter and @xmath7 binning , giving a pixel scale of @xmath10 and a @xmath11 field of view .",
    "after standard debiasing and flat - fielding operations , we performed differential aperture photometry of hat - p-4 and several other stars in the field .",
    "we begin with hat - p-14 , for which the analysis proved simpler .",
    "the model for the rv data took the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radial component of a keplerian orbit , @xmath14 is the anomalous velocity due to the rm effect , and @xmath15 is an arbitrary offset related to the barycentric rv of the template spectrum . to model the rm effect",

    "many of the parameters of the keplerian orbit and of the eclipses have been tightly constrained by previous observations .",
    "we adopted priors on those parameters , to keep the number of free parameters in our model to a minimum .",

    "all the numerical values and uncertainties are taken from torres et al .",
    "we held constant the orbital eccentricity @xmath31 and argument of pericenter @xmath32 , since those parameters have little effect on the model once the transit ephemeris is specified .    for @xmath33",
    ", we used the quadrature sum of the internally - estimated measurement error ( typically 4  m  s@xmath19 ; see table 1 ) and a `` jitter '' term of 7.8  m  s@xmath19 , a value determined from the condition @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the excess noise was assumed to be uncorrelated in time .",
    "it is comparable in magnitude to the jitter term of 7.3  m  s@xmath19 used by torres et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "there were only two completely free parameters in our model : @xmath15 , the overall rv offset ; and @xmath22 , the projected spin - orbit angle .",
    "parameter optimization and error estimation were achieved with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm , using gibbs sampling and metropolis - hastings stepping .",
    "table  [ tbl : params - hat14 ] summarizes the results .",
    "the first section lists all of the adjustable model parameters , for which uniform priors were adopted .",
    "the last section gives some results for other quantities that were computed based on the model parameters , or taken from torres et al .",
    "the quoted values and ranges are based on the 50% , 15.85% , and 84.15% confidence levels of the marginalized posteriors .",
    "figure  [ fig : hat14 ] shows the rv data and the results for @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "the result for @xmath22 is @xmath35  degrees , indicating that the directions of orbital motion and stellar rotation are nearly opposite as projected on the sky .",
    "this result could be anticipated from a visual inspection of figure  [ fig : hat14 ] , which shows that the anomalous rv was a redshift in the second half of the transit and ( less obviously ) a blueshift in the first half .",
    "this is an inversion of the more familiar pattern of a well - aligned system .",
    "the orbit of hat - p-14b is strongly misaligned with the rotational plane of its parent star .",
    "although the finding of a retrograde orbit is robust , the small uncertainty in @xmath22 depends critically on the prior constraint on @xmath20 .",
    "if that constraint is dropped , a slower rotation rate is favored ( @xmath36  km  s@xmath19 ) , allowing a broader range of spin - orbit angles ( @xmath37  degrees ) .",
    "these results are also illustrated by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : hat14 ] .",
    "one possible reason for the smaller result for @xmath20 is differential rotation : the rm effect depends on the rotation rate over the range of latitudes spanned by the transit chord , which may differ from the spectroscopically - estimated equatorial rotation rate .",
    "the near - grazing transit of hat - p-14 , in particular , may produce the most extreme possible difference .",
    "further observations with a higher signal - to - noise ratio might be able to identify the specific signal of differential rotation ( gaudi & winn 2007 ) .",
    "the case of hat - p-4 was more complicated , partly because our rv observations revealed a third body in the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : hat4_orb ] illustrates that a single planet on a circular orbit no longer provides a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "the best - fitting model has @xmath38 with 18 degrees of freedom .",
    "the residuals have an rms of 15.9  m  s@xmath19 and are highly correlated , with almost all of the most recent rvs lying above the model curve . allowing the orbit to be eccentric reduces @xmath39 to 906.0 , but the residuals still have an rms of 15  m  s@xmath19 and show the same pattern .",
    "a much better fit is obtained when the circular orbit is supplemented by a constant acceleration @xmath40 .",
    "this model , illustrated in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : hat4_orb ] , gives @xmath41 and more randomly scattered residuals with an rms residual of 6.8  m  s@xmath19 .",
    "an mcmc analysis gives @xmath42  m  s@xmath19  day@xmath19 .",
    "the constant acceleration may represent the rv variation due to a companion star or planet whose orbit is longer than the three - year span of our observations .",
    "assuming it is a low - mass body on a nearly circular orbit , we may set @xmath43 , giving an order - of - magnitude constraint @xmath44 however , given the limited time sampling of our data it is also possible that the companion has a shorter period .",
    "we have not found any compelling two - planet models , but we are continuing to gather additional rv data and will report elsewhere on the results .",
    "the pertinent conclusions for this study are ( 1 ) there is a third body in the system , and ( 2 ) the mass and orbital parameters of hat - p-4b are subject to systematic errors due to the unknown influence of the third body on the rv data . for the latter reason , in our analysis of the transit data we did not employ a prior constraint on @xmath30 , as we did for hat - p-14 .",
    "another difference in our analysis is that we fitted the available photometric data along with the transit - night rv data , because the new data offer better constraints on the transit ephemeris , depth , duration , and partial duration .",
    "our photometric model was taken from the transit light curve project ( see , e.g. , holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .",
    "2009c ) . in brief , we used the mandel & agol ( 2002 ) formulas for a quadratic limb - darkening law , as implemented by pl ( 2008 ) .",
    "the linear coefficient was allowed to vary freely , and the quadratic coefficient was held fixed at the claret  ( 2004 ) value ( 0.3418 for @xmath6-band , and 0.3395 for @xmath45-band ) .",
    "the out - of - transit magnitude was allowed to be a linear function of airmass , to account for color - dependent differential extinction .",
    "the errors for each light curve were set equal to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the root - mean - squared ( rms ) residual , and @xmath48 accounts for time correlations , using the method of pont et al .",

    "the quantitative results hinge on the prior constraint on @xmath20 . by repeating the analysis with no such constraint , we find @xmath53  km  s@xmath19 and @xmath54  degrees .",
    "these much broader results are also illustrated by the gray lines in figure  [ fig : hat4 ] .",
    "the only well - constrained combination of those two parameters is @xmath55  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "it might seem surprising that tighter bounds on @xmath22 were obtained for hat - p-14 than for hat - p-4 , given that the signal - to - noise ratio of the rm effect is higher for hat - p-4 .",
    "this is a consequence of the difference in the impact parameter ( the minimum sky - projected distance between the planet and the star , in units of the stellar radius ) .",
    "the interpretation of the rm signal is most robust for systems with a high impact parameter , because in such cases the two key parameters @xmath20 and @xmath22 play distinct roles : @xmath20 controls the amplitude of the signal and @xmath22 controls its shape ( i.e.  the phase of the transit when the anomalous rv switches from positive to negative , or vice versa ) . for systems with low impact parameters , such as hat - p-4 ,",
    "the shape of the rm signal is nearly independent of @xmath22 and both parameters control the amplitude .",
    "this leads to a strong degeneracy between those two parameters ( gaudi & winn 2007 ) .    therefore , an external constraint on @xmath20 is crucial for the determination of @xmath22 in systems with low impact parameters . in our study",
    "we have used a prior based on the line broadening observed in the star s optical spectrum .",
    "however , it must be acknowledged that the resulting estimate of @xmath20 is subject to systematic error due to uncertainties in the competing effects of macroturbulence and other broadening mechanisms .",
    "this is especially problematic for cool , low - mass stars for which turbulent and instrumental broadening exceed rotational broadening ; examples are tres-1 ( narita et al .",
    "2007 ) and wasp-4 ( triaud et al .  2010 ) . for hat - p-4",
    "the situation is better because rotational broadening is expected to be at least as important as turbulent broadening.4.5  m  s@xmath19 ( gray  2008 , p.  443 ) as compared to the inferred @xmath20 of @xmath56  m  s@xmath19 . ]",
    "we turn now to the question posed at the beginning of this paper : do hot stars have high obliquities ? specifically , among the host stars of close - in planets , are those with @xmath57  k more likely to be aligned with the planetary orbits than hotter stars ? we have found that hat - p-4 is a well - aligned cool star ( @xmath58  deg , @xmath59  k ) , and hat - p-14 is a misaligned hot star ( @xmath60  deg , @xmath61  k ) .",
    "therefore , these new data strengthen the trend that was observed by winn et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "schlaufman ( 2010 ) found a similar pattern using a different technique , involving a comparison between the observed and expected line - of - sight rotational velocities of the stars with transiting planets .",
    "he described the pattern in terms of stellar mass rather than effective temperature .",
    "indeed , those two parameters are strongly correlated for dwarf stars , with scatter due to metallicity and age . for hat - p-4 and hat - p-14 ,",
    "the stellar masses are @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . for these systems",
    "there is a clearer contrast in effective temperature ( 6.1@xmath64 ) than mass ( 1.7@xmath64 ) .",
    "the very different results for @xmath22 suggest that effective temperature is more closely related to obliquity than mass .",
    "this in turn would support the hypothesis of winn et al .",
    "( 2010a ) that the differing obliquities are a consequence of differing internal structure of the stars , and specifically the depth of the outer convective zone , since this structural difference is more closely related to effective temperature than mass ( pinsonneault et al .",
    ".    it will be interesting to examine all the systems for which the rm effect has been measured , to see whether temperature or mass is more important , and whether there are other variables related to obliquity .",
    "we defer such a study for the future , to allow the sample size to grow substantially since the last such analysis by winn et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "one variable that will be especially interesting to assess is the presence or absence of a third body .",
    "a migration mechanism involving the kozai effect , which has been invoked to explain high obliquities , requires the existence of a third body ( see , e.g. , fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) . in planet - planet scattering scenarios ,",
    "a third body may also be present , although it could have been ejected ( see , e.g. , chatterjee et al .",
    "evidence for additional bodies has been found in some well - aligned systems such as hat - p-13 ( bakos et al .",

    "2010 ) , as would a comparison between the observed obliquity distribution and that predicted by the kozai model ( fabrycky & winn 2009 ; morton & johnson 2010 ) .",
    "it will also be interesting to extend these studies to multi - transiting systems such as kepler-9 ( holman et al .",
    ". this will allow the mutual inclinations of the orbits to be determined , along with the obliquity of the star ( fabrycky 2009 , ragozzine & holman 2010 ) . if the mechanism that causes spin - orbit misalignments is related to star formation ( bate et al .",
    "2010 ) or star - disk interactions ( lai et al .",
    "2010 ) , and is not related to the planet , then one would expect the planetary orbits to be well - aligned and the star to be tipped away from their common orbital plane .",
