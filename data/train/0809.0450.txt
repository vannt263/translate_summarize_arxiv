    "in the context of the large effort performed within the lhc  @xcite experiments in order to finalize the construction of the standard model ( sm ) and to shed some light on the building blocks of its future extension , the b physics program plays a very important role .    in a complementary way to the direct searches of higgs boson(s ) and new particles , the new physics ( np ) processes can be studied by making precision measurements in the flavour sector , where we do expect significant effects",
    "if the np scale is not completely decoupled from the tev energy range .    in this framework , the b meson system is a natural place where to look .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons properties have already been studied in detail by the b - factories experiments ( cleo , babar , belle ) yielding and impressive agreement with the sm expectations .",
    "the properties of the @xmath1 mesons , not available at e@xmath2e@xmath3 colliders(5s ) .",
    "the small statistics of @xmath1 mesons collected , will mainly be used to measure some absolute branching ratios .",
    "] , are much less constrained and there s still room to account for significant contributions from np effects . moreover",
    ", the study of the b system with high statistics samples of different b hadrons can be used to further constrain the sm cp violation mechanism described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "three lhc experiments , lhcb  @xcite atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , have defined a research program that includes the search of rare decays and np signatures trough precision measurements of the meson decays .",
    "while lhcb  @xcite is devoted and optimized for the measurement of the b meson properties , the other two are general purpose experiments where the study of b mesons proceeds in parallel with the higgs boson and supersymmetry searches .",
    "the doability of such b physics programs at the hadron machines is demonstrated by the recent results of tevatron experiments ( cdf , d0",
    "@xcite ) with their nice measurements of @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the lhc environment , the expected resolutions of the various detectors and their triggering strategies are reviewed in section [ sec : lhc ] , while section [ sec : bprog ] contains the detail description of the physics program and of the expected performances that can be achieved with the data samples collected during the first year of operation of lhc .",
    "the parameters summarizing the lhc environment for b physics studies ( center of mass energy , cross sections , luminosity ) are reported in table  [ tab : kpar ] for the lhcb , atlas and cms experiments .    the very large cross section for @xmath7  production , yielding @xmath8(10@xmath9 )",
    "@xmath7  pairs per second ( l = 10@xmath10  @xmath11 s@xmath12 ) with all the b - hadrons species being produced , extend down to 10@xmath13 the branching ratio ( br ) measurement capability for the rare b decays .",
    "for this aim a huge effort is needed in order to reduce the large background coming from the pp interactions , whose production cross section is two orders of magnitude higher than the b quarks production one .",
    "attention should also be paid to the choice of running luminosity ( l ) : while larger l provides larger data samples , the number of interactions per crossing increase rapidly with l , creating problems to the b hadron reconstruction and identification ( see table  [ tab : kpar ] ) .",
    "the main difference in the visible cross section between the lhcb detector , a single arm forward spectrometer accepting events with 1.8@xmath145 , and the atlas / cms detectors , that are accepting events with @xmath152.5 , comes from the lower p@xmath16 threshold that can be achieved in the former .",
    "the production of @xmath7  pairs in lhc , according to pythia simulations , occurs with the @xmath7  pairs highly collimated ( as shown in figure [ fig : bbcorr ] ) : this also favor the lhcb forward design with respect to the 4@xmath17 design of the others two experiments .",
    ".center of mass energy , cross sections , luminosity and number of interactions per crossing expected in the lhcb , atlas and cms experiments . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : btodpres ]      the current prediction of @xmath18(@xmath7  ) @xmath19 500  @xmath20b comes from the extrapolations of tevatron results : a precise measurement of such cross section is of major importance in order to test the mc simulations , the nlo qcd calculations used for the extrapolations and the parton density functions ( pdf ) knowledge .",
    "for the rare decays , np and new particle searches the knowledge of @xmath18(@xmath7  ) is also important to achieve a good estimate of the background level .",
    "inclusive and exclusive strategies can be used to measure the cross section .",
    "all the lhc experiments plan to use j/@xmath21 events to measure the production rate : the muons in the decay ensure an high efficiency in triggering and reconstructing those channels . in atlas and cms",
    "experiments an additional requirement on the transverse energy ( e@xmath16 ) is used in order to enhance the b quark component in the data sample .",
    "the statistical error that can be achieved is @xmath19 1% , already with small data samples ( l @xmath22 ) .",
    "more detailed analyses , aiming at a full p@xmath16 scan , achieving a resolution of @xmath1910% in all bins , have been performed in cms assuming l @xmath19 10  fb@xmath12 .",
    "the lhc program is proceeding without major delays : first beam is expected in september and the first collisions soon afterwards .",
    "there are currently three experiments getting ready for the b physics challenge : with the expected performance they will be able to test sm and beyond sm ( np ) effects .",
    "the first analysis approach reported here is related to the b@xmath23s observables , that can cleanly reveal some np effects .",
    "a first goal of the lhc experiments is the measurement of the @xmath24 br down to its current sm prediction and of the @xmath6 angle with a 0.04 absolute precision .",
    "these goals can be achieved with data collected during 2009 .",
    "the lhcb detector will also address the study of b@xmath23dk and b@xmath23hh decay modes that can be used to reduce the ckm @xmath25 angle uncertainty down to 10@xmath26 , with data collected during 2009 .",
