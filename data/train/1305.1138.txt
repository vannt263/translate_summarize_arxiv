    "higher resolution fir observations of saturn s atmosphere were carried out very recently with the _ herschel _ satellite , and the vertical distribution of ph@xmath0 was derived  @xcite .",
    "phosphine is also a likely species to occur in the atmospheres of giant extrasolar planets or of brown dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been tentatively detected in the circumstellar shells of carbon - rich late - type stars cw  leonis  @xcite , also known as irc  + 10216 , and v1610  cygni , also known as crl  2688 , by radio - astronomical observations of the @xmath10 transition .",

    "they were unable to resolve any tunneling splitting , but obtained hyperfine structure parameters caused by the @xmath8p and @xmath9h nuclei and an improved value for the dipole moment .",
    "chu and oka recorded @xmath5 transitions with @xmath4 and @xmath11 and estimated an effective value for the centrifugal distortion induced dipole moment from intensity measurements  @xcite .",

    "a combined fit of these data together with previous results has been carried out here to obtain an improved set of spectroscopic parameters which should be useful not only for spectroscopic observations of phosphine in planetary atmospheres , brown dwarfs , or other regions in space , but also for future analyses of rovibrational spectra or as benchmarks for quantum - chemical calculations .",

    "the rotational energies and transitions of a strongly oblate rotor in its ground vibrational state and without @xmath2/@xmath3 splitting require for their modeling only @xmath30 and @xmath31 along with distortion parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 to lowest order . in a strongly prolate rotor",
    ", @xmath35 is replaced with @xmath36 .",
    "the purely axial parameters @xmath30 , @xmath34 , etc . can usually not be determined by rotational spectroscopy .",

    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 distortion corrections and possibly even higher order terms may be required in the fit .",
    "early treatments of the rotational spectrum of ph@xmath0 used parameters as described above to fit the rotational transitions . however , it was recognized early on that the parameter derived for @xmath41 was too large by about a factor of 4  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found later , that the hamiltonian converged rather slowly  @xcite .",
    "tarrago and dang nhu  @xcite discussed the formulation of the hamiltonian for symmetric top molecules approaching the spheric rotor limit employing the examples opf@xmath0 and ph@xmath0 .",
    "they pointed out that for such molecules not only the @xmath42 terms derived from @xmath41 , also called @xmath43 in their work , affect the @xmath2/@xmath3 splitting , but also terms with @xmath5 , whose lowest order term is @xmath44 , which is also called @xmath45 .",

    "the latter fit was slightly better , but yielded a value for @xmath41 only slightly smaller than in the fit without @xmath44 , meaning that their value was still too lage by almost a factor of 4 .",
    "moreover , their value for @xmath44 was too small by about a factor of 3 .",
    "interestingly , they did not attempt any fits without parameters derived from @xmath41 .",
    "fusina and carlotti recorded the fir spectrum of ph@xmath0 and made assignments for the ground vibrational state between 44 and 202  @xmath48 with @xmath49 between 4 and 22 and @xmath40 between 19 and 0  @xcite .",
    "they used in their fits their own data together with previous data from refs .",
    "three different fits were presented which included parameters derived from both @xmath44 and @xmath41 as well as parameters derived either from @xmath44 or @xmath41 .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath41 were completely correlated if both were used .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath50 were completely correlated in the fit without parameters derived from @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , the fit with only parameters derived from @xmath44 did not produce severe correlations , yielded the best standard deviation , but employed two more parameters than the other two fits .",
    "this fit was their preferred one .",
    "the fits carried out in the course of the present investigation employed herb pickett s spfit and spcat programs  @xcite .",
    "they started from the preferred parameters from fusina and carlotti  @xcite and the hyperfine parameters employed by cazzoli and puzzarini  @xcite using transition frequencies from refs .",
    "@xcite with uncertainties as reported .",
    "the rf transitions  @xcite were reportedly accurate to between 0.1 and 0.2  khz .",
    "initially , 0.2  khz were used in the fits because the published deviations from the measured frequencies exceeded 0.6  khz in two cases",
    ". however , the transitions were reproduced in the present fits to well within 0.1  khz on average with no severe outliers .",
    "therefore , 0.1  khz uncertainties were employed for these data in the final fits . the uncertainties of ref .",
    "@xcite were used as reported in ref .",
    "including @xmath51 in the fit , which was contrained to zero in ref .",
    "@xcite , yielded a reasonable value , and suggested the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 to be indeterminate .",
    "the latter three parameters could be omitted from the fit without significant deterioration of the fit .",
    "the resulting parameters , including those for the hyperfine structure , are given in table  [ parameters ] under heading ",
    "present , alternative  .    hyperfine structure caused by the @xmath8p and @xmath9h nuclei was resolved in the rf spectra  @xcite and in the lamb - dip measurements from ref .",
    "the hyperfine hamiltonian was described in sufficient detail e.g. in the latter work .",
    "as mentioned in that work , the lamb - dip measurements were rather sensitive to the perpendicular components @xmath55 of the p and h nuclear spin - rotation tensors , which are also known as @xmath56 , and to the axial components @xmath57(p@xmath58h ) and @xmath59(h@xmath58h ) of the spin - spin coupling tensors , which are also known as @xmath60(p@xmath58h ) and @xmath60(h@xmath58h ) , respectively .",
    "they were not as sensitive to the axial components @xmath61 of the nuclear spin - rotation tensor , which are also known as @xmath62 , and to the perpendicular component @xmath63(p@xmath58h ) of the p@xmath58h spin - spin coupling tensor , also known as @xmath64(p@xmath58h ) .",
    "in contrast , the rf data were sensitive to @xmath55 and @xmath61 of both nuclei , but not as sensitive to the spin - spin coupling tensors . in the present fit , @xmath63 could still not be determined significantly and with confidence . however , its omission increased the standard deviation of the fit somewhat .",
    "therefore , it was retained in the fit kept fixed to the calculated value from ref .  @xcite .",
    "other parameters , such as @xmath65(h ) , the off - diagonal h spin - rotation parameter , the scalar spin - spin coupling parameters , or distortion corrections to the p or h nuclear spin - rotation parameters were not determined with significance , and their inclusion had a negligible effect on the quality of the fit .",
    "therefore , they were omitted from the final fits .    as can be seen in table  [ parameters ] , the present hyperfine parameters are in good to very good agreement with previously determined ones  @xcite , but have much smaller uncertainties in the present fits .",
    "the values of the spin - spin coupling parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 agree very well with the calculated ones of 3.18  khz and 20.7  khz , respectively .",
    "in fact , keeping the spin - spin coupling parameters fixed to the calculated values , does not deteriorate the quality of the fit significantly .",
    "in addition , the values of the other parameters and , somewhat surprisingly , even their uncertainties are affected negligibly .",
    "the remaining spectroscopic parameters agree for the most part well with the preferred ones from fusina and carlotti  @xcite as far as they were determined in both fits .",
    "exceptions are the two octic distortion parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is a result of the omission of @xmath51 by fusina and carlotti and of the omission of some higher order distortion corrections to @xmath44 in the present fits .",
    "notably , the values of @xmath44 agree quite well , about 832  khz versus 829  khz .",
    "both values , however , are slightly larger than 723  khz calculated by tarrago and dang nhu  @xcite and 773  khz calculated by fusina and carlotti  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 and its distortion corrections cause @xmath5 transitions , among others , to have non - zero intensities very similar to those calculated without these parameters , but with the effective centrifugal distortion correction to the permanent dipole moment mentioned in ref .",
    "therefore , another fit has been carried out with @xmath41 kept fixed at the value of 11.3  hz calculated in ref .",
    "the @xmath44 value of 714.5  khz resulting from this fit is very close to the one calculated by tarrago and dang nhu  @xcite , but somewhat smaller than the one from fusina and carlotti  @xcite .",
    "all other parameters are also affected in their magnitudes .",
    "this fit is considered to be the preferred one .",
    "the effects on the intensities of the @xmath5 transitions correspond closely to the square of the ratios of the @xmath44 values , the intensities of all other transitions change only marginally between the two data sets .",
    "the quality of the preferred fit and of the alternative fit are identical .",
    "the experimental transition frequencies have been reproduced within the reported uncertainties on average , the rms error is 0.93 , slightly better than the ideal 1.0 .",
    "there is some scatter among the rms errors of individual data sets : it is 0.77 for the rf data  @xcite and 0.64  @xcite , 0.87  @xcite , and 0.94  @xcite for the older millimeter and submillimeter data .",
    "the fir data from fusina and carlotti  @xcite were given uncertainties of 0.0001  @xmath48 throughout , as suggested by the authors , even though the residuals increased somewhat for the transitions with the highest two @xmath39 values .",
    "two transitions omitted already by fusina and carlotti were also omitted here .",
    "in addition , the frequency of the transition with @xmath70 and @xmath71 was omitted as its residual exceeded @xmath72 .",
    "the rms error of the fir transitions was 0.94 ; the frequencies of 4 transitions , all at higher @xmath39 values , had residuals larger than @xmath73 , which is reasonably close to the statistical expectations in the case of 230 different transition frequencies .",
    "an rms error of 1.37 was obtained for the data from ref .",
    "even though this suggests slightly optimistic uncertainty estimates , no adjustments were made , as one frequency , 533815.1259  ( 10 )  mhz , contributed particularly to the rms error .",
    "omission of this line reduced the rms error of this data set to slightly below 1.1 .",
    "in addition , the omission of this line from the overall line list affected all parameters within experimental uncertainties .",
    "therefore , this line was retained in the final fit .",
    "the @xmath39-dependent parameters , in particular the ones dependent purely on @xmath39 have much smaller uncertainties in the present fits compared to the preferred fit of fusina and carlotti  @xcite .",
    "this is hardly surprising given the nature of the new data from ref .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath34 and @xmath74 here are actually slightly larger than from the fir fit .",
    "this may be caused by differences in the correlation of the parameters or by differences in the weighting scheme .",
    "predictions of the rotational spectrum were made for the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy , cdms  @xcite , using the parameters of the preferred fit .",
    "the upper quantum numbers were @xmath75 and @xmath76 , ensuring convergence of the rotational part of the partition function to @xmath77 up to 500  k. the intensity cut - offs were chosen to include all experimental @xmath1 transitions between @xmath2 and @xmath3 levels on one hand and to limit the number of transitions with uncertainties equal to or larger than 1  ghz , as spcat displays such uncertainties as 999.9999  mhz or 0.0334  @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to transitions with upper @xmath39 and @xmath40 of 34 and 31 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath78 transition with @xmath79 is the most intense transition at 300  k. at 500  k and 1000  k , the corresponding transition with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , is the most intense one . with phosphine being only a minor constituent in the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn",
    ", the current predictions should therefore contain sufficient ground state rotational transitions not only at 300  k , but also , after appropriate conversion of the intensities , for 500  k and likely for 1000  k. however , the neglect of rotational transitions in excited vibrational states may cause non - negligible errors already around 300  k , as can be seen below .",
    "intensities of the transitions with @xmath5 should be viewed with some caution as indicated above .",
    "predictions of transition frequencies with @xmath7 should be reliable as long as the predicted uncertainties do not exceed 5  mhz .",
    "predictions of transition frequencies with @xmath82 should be viewed with caution if the predicted uncertainties are larger than 0.5  mhz . in these cases",
    ", the actual frequencies may differ from the predictions by more than five times the predicted uncertainties .",
    "the partition function values given in the documentation of the cdms entry do not include vibrational contributions ; they are about 2.4% at 300  k and amount to about",
    "18.5% at 500  k. classically estimated vibrational contributions are intended to be provided through a link in the documentation file .",
    "it should be mentioned that the hitran entry takes into account vibrational contributions to the partition function .",
    "moreover , the intensities at 300  k have been converted to those at 296  k , which is the default temperature in hitran .",
    "pickett s spfit and spcat programs  @xcite use the total parity .",
    "this parity is therefore also used in the ascii table version of the ph@xmath0 entry in the cdms .",
    "it differs both from the @xmath2/@xmath3 parity as well as from the @xmath83/@xmath84 parity .",
    "@xmath36 levels with @xmath58 parity belong to @xmath3 for even @xmath40 and to @xmath2 for odd @xmath40 . @xmath36",
    "levels with @xmath58 parity belong to @xmath84 for @xmath85 even and to @xmath83 for @xmath85 odd .",
    "additional confusion may occur because the @xmath86 sign has been omitted , and transitions with rounded @xmath2/@xmath3 splitting of less than 0.1  khz have been merged .",
    "these transitions are thus between two @xmath36 levels without parity designation . moreover , since only 2 characters are available for each quantum number , @xmath40 values @xmath87 with negative parity are indicated by lower case characters ; e.g. a2 , a5 , a8 , and b1 are used for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the entry in hitran provides their common parity labels .",
    "it should be also mentioned that a process is under way to create a database version of the cdms within the framework of the virtual atomic and molecular data centre ( vamdc )  @xcite .",
    "the official release of a test version is still pending because very many entries need to be imported properly , and in many cases necessary auxiliary files need to be created .",
    "one of the goals of vamdc is providing easily interpretable quantum numbers .    fairly recently , dipole moment and potential energy surfaces were reported , and selected ground state rotational energies have been provided  @xcite .",
    "the deviations between their energies and the present ones are fairly small .",
    "they drop at @xmath92 from 0.9164  @xmath48 for @xmath78 to 0.4720  @xmath48 for @xmath71 .",
    "the deviations are larger at @xmath93 , where they drop from 3.4312  @xmath48 for @xmath78 to 2.9680  @xmath48 for @xmath71 . because of the extent of the experimental data , these deviations are probably predominantly due to insufficiencies in the calculated potential energy surface .",
    "more recently , a very extensive and very accurate line list has been created for ph@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the authors found a remarkably good agreement between their transition frequencies and the ones in the first cdms entry which had been created in october 2008 and which has been recalculated in february of 2013 by lowering the intensity cut - offs to provide weaker transition frequencies which in part access higher quantum numbers .",
    "these predictions correspond essentially to the ones derived from the alternative fit in the present work .",
    "the authors mentioned that the deviations are below 0.003  @xmath48 for the strongest 100 transitions  @xcite .",
    "as these transitions involve @xmath39 values between 3 and 14 and @xmath40 values from 0 to 9 , which are all covered by experimental data , the deviations are probably again predominantly due to insufficiencies in the calculated potential energy surface .",
    "moreover , differences in the predicted frequencies generated from the preferred fot or the alternative fit are very small for these transitions . even more remarkable",
    "are the deviations at low quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath94 prediction from ref .",
    "@xcite is only 2.8  mhz lower than the experimental frequency as well as the frequency calculated from either present fit .",
    "the deviations decrease first with increasing @xmath39 , until the frequency of the @xmath95 transition is actually higher than the one predicted from the preferred fit .",
    "similarly , the @xmath96 transition frequency from ref .",
    "@xcite is only 3.6  mhz lower than the one predicted from the preferred fit .",
    "again , the deviations decrease first for increasing @xmath39 until the @xmath97 transition frequency is higher in frequency .",
    "the agreement is still rather good if all transitions from the previous cdms predictions are compared with those from ref .",
    "@xcite ; the authors give an rms value of 0.076  @xmath48 .",
    "because of the limitations in the experimental data as well as in the hamiltonian model , it may well be that the predicted transition frequencies from the present study are eventually less reliable that those from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the intensities from ref .",
    "@xcite agree very well with either prediction from the present fits for @xmath7 transitions .",
    "the value for @xmath98 from the former work is 3.9% larger than the experimental value from ref .",
    "@xcite ; this deviation is almost canceled by the neglect of the vibrational contributions to the partition function at 300  k in the present work .",
    "however , there are larger deviations between the calculated intensities of @xmath5 transitions ; e.g. , the intensity of the @xmath96 transition from ref .",
    "@xcite is a factor of 1.85 weaker than the intensity from predictions generated from the preferred fit ; it is even weaker by a factor of 2.5 if predictions generated from the alternative fit are used .",
    "possible explanations for these deviations are insufficiencies in the calculations from ref .",
    "@xcite , insufficiencies in the preferred hamiltonian model , e.g. @xmath52 had to be constrained to zero , or the neglect of distortion corrections to the electric dipole moment .",
    "it may well be that each of these explanations is responsible in part .",
    "improved spectroscopic parameters of ph@xmath0 have been determined from recent very accurate rotational transition frequencies combined with previous data .",
    "predictions for the ground state rotational spectrum of ph@xmath0 generated from the preferred fit and employing the permanent dipole moment of 0.57395  d  @xcite will be provided in the catalog section of the cdms  @xcite and in the new edition of hitran .",
    "transition frequencies with assignments , uncertainties , and residuals between the observed frequencies and those calculated from the preferred parameter set as well as the predictions in the cdms format will be provided as supplementary material .",
