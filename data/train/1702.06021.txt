    "since the discovery of baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) black hole in @xmath0dimensions , there has been a vast literature in the same context @xcite .",
    "expectedly there has been a race to derive rival metrics to btz by employing new physical sources other than the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "as the problem amounts to introduce new physical sources it has become part of the classical field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "just to mention a few , we note that they range from linear maxwell @xcite to non - linear electrodynamics @xcite as well as scalar fields @xcite , dilatons @xcite , scalar multiplets @xcite , born - infeld @xcite , brans - dicke extensions @xcite , etc .. in particular , recently we have obtained classes of scalar multiplet fields acting as sources of gravity in both @xmath1 and @xmath2dimensions @xcite .",
    "this method amounts to consider a set of scalar multiplets @xmath3 with the index @xmath4 belonging to an internal gauge group , specifically the group @xmath5 for @xmath1 and @xmath6 for @xmath2dimensions .",
    "however , upon deriving the field equations we had the freedom to reduce the problem to circular / spherical symmetry by suppressing the angular dependence and concentrating only on the modulus of @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage in such a reduction ansatz is to pave the way towards technically solvable system of equations .",
    "the scope of the model can further be extended by adding a self - interacting potential . from physical considerations",
    "scalar multiplets are familiar field theoretical objects whose experimental construction may be feasible in a foreseeable future .",
    "the special case of a scalar multiplet is provided by a scalar singlet in which there is no internal gauge group .",
    "our model considered herein is a massless scalar field singlet with an exponential potential of scalar coupled to gravity in @xmath0dimensions 27 .",
    "our system admits exact solutions with two parameters and can be considered yet another , one - parametric extension of the btz solution .",
    "after substitution of the solution for the scalar field the potential takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the crucial parameter in our model ranging over @xmath9 unless stated otherwise . note also that the solution for @xmath10 can easily be mapped to the former case so that we make our choice of @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 it can be anticipated easily that for @xmath13 the resulting black hole solution reduces to the btz solution .",
    "we make use of the parameter @xmath11 , which can be phrased as `` scalar charge '' together with the cosmological constant to establish a large class of einstein - scalar solutions .",
    "once this is accomplished the principal aim in the present paper is to employ this class of solutions to build thin - shell wormholes 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56 .",
    "the role of the scalar field in such a construction is interesting : assuming a linear gas / fluid equation of state at the throat of the thin - shell wormhole allows us to make stable such wormholes . by stability",
    "it is meant throughout the paper , against small linear perturbations to preserve its identity through harmonic oscillations .",
    "initial velocities at the throat of the perturbed fields may be considered in various ranges bounded only by the speed of light .",
    "these are called velocity dependent perturbations and they play important role in stability / instability checking analysis .",
    "when these are all taken into consideration we are able to show the existence of stability regions for our wormhole all by virtue of the role played by the scalar charge .",
    "besides stability against linear perturbations we construct also thin - shell wormhole confined in between high potential barriers so that it remains forever stable in its potential well .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the einstein - scalar field equations with the exponential potential and integrate them completely . construction and dynamical analysis of the wormhole is investigated thoroughly in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we complete the paper with our concluding remarks .",
    "before we start this section we comment that , recently a different approach has been employed by two of us to find similar results in ref .",
    "the action in @xmath0dimensional spherically symmetric , static theory of gravity coupled to a scalar field is given by ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the ricci scalar , @xmath17 is the scalar field , @xmath11 and @xmath18 are coupling constants .",
    "the line element is chosen to be@xmath19 in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 are unknown functions of radial coordinate @xmath22 to be found from the field equations .",
    "explicitly the lagrangian density becomes@xmath23where a prime denotes @xmath24 .",
    "the scalar field equation is obtained as@xmath25einstein field equations can be derived directly by variation of the action in terms of @xmath26 and they are given by@xmath27where @xmath28 is the energy momentum tensor given by @xmath29due to @xmath30 which is a function of @xmath22 the explicit form of the energy momentum tensor components are calculated as @xmath31@xmath32and@xmath33finally the explicit form of the einstein s equations are given by@xmath34@xmath35and@xmath36which together with ( 4 ) admit the following solutions@xmath37@xmath38and@xmath39 in which @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two integration constants .",
    "let s add that with @xmath13 one finds @xmath42 and the action reduces to@xmath43 in which @xmath18 plays the role of a cosmological constant .",
    "the field equations admit the btz solution with @xcite@xmath44therefore for @xmath45 we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that the @xmath48 limit works correctly . hence our metric functions for @xmath49 can be written as@xmath50and@xmath51with the potential @xmath52for the case @xmath53 from ( 14 ) and ( 15 )",
    "one can redefine the time and absorb the constant @xmath41 which means that we can set it to one .    depending on the values of the free parameters ,",
    "the general solution may admit black hole or naked singular spacetimes .",
    "but at any cost the solution is not asymptotically flat . therefore to find the mass of the central object one can use the definition of brown and york ( by ) mass @xcite .",
    "before we apply this formalism we would like to comment that other methods exist in literature which use the noether s theorem in order to find the conserved quantities including mass in a non - asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "for @xmath0dimensional btz solution we suggest to consult @xcite while for a wider study and comparison between these methods with the by prescription one may look at @xcite . since our aim in the present study is to investigate einstein scalar thin - shell wormholes we delete the alternative analysis for the conserved quantities to a future study .    in accordance with the by mass in a @xmath54dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime with the line element @xmath55the by mass",
    "is given by@xmath56where @xmath57 is the reference function and @xmath58 stands for the radius of the boundary surface . using ( 21 ) for the black hole solution with @xmath49",
    "we obtain @xmath59 and the line element can be written as@xmath60 in which @xmath61 this solution includes the btz limit when @xmath62 this form of line element is valid only when @xmath63 for @xmath64 the solution does not admit any known limit and therefore one has to consider the solution in its original form given by ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) . in the rest of this work",
    "we impose @xmath65 and the line element which we shall refer frequently is given by ( 23 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 can be mapped to @xmath67 and therefore we exclude it .    before we finish this section",
    "we add that the field equations , in the limit of @xmath68 admit @xmath69@xmath70with @xmath71 in which @xmath72 is a new integration constant .",
    "hence the line element becomes@xmath73which is the solution of einstein - self interacting scalar field in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "let s consider the @xmath0dimensional spherically symmetric static bulk spacetime , @xmath74 , given by ( 23 ) which can be written more appropriately as@xmath75where @xmath76 is the radius of the horizon which is given by @xmath77with @xmath49 .",
    "we consider a timelike hypersurface @xmath78 defined by@xmath79 in which @xmath80 next , we make two copies from the bulk located outside @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 ( let s call them @xmath83 ) and we paste them at the location of @xmath84 the resulting manifold i.e. , @xmath85 is a complete manifold with a throat located at the location of @xmath84 for the smooth matching at the throat one has to apply the israel junction conditions @xcite which are given by , i ) the induced metric tensor on either side of the throat must be identical i.e. , @xmath86 and ii ) the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature must satisfy @xmath87 in which @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the energy momentum tensor on the shell @xmath84 herein @xmath92 is the extrinsic curvature tensor on the either sides of the throat defined by@xmath93where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the coordinate systems on the bulk and the throat , respectively .",
    "the first condition is satisfied by setting@xmath96such that the line element on the shell is given by@xmath97 in which @xmath98 is the proper time on the shell .",
    "let s add also that in general the coordinates of either sides of the throat are related as @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101but due to the identical metric in either sides of the throat i.e. , @xmath102 and @xmath103 they become equal i.e.,@xmath104 in which @xmath105and @xmath106 in ( 31 ) @xmath107 are the normal vectors on both sides of the throat defined as@xmath108 in which based on ( 31 ) the @xmath109 and @xmath110 refer to @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively , and explicitly they are given by@xmath113herein a dot implies the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath114 following @xmath107 we obtain@xmath115and@xmath116which yield@xmath117and@xmath118 in which a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath22 and all expressions are at @xmath119 explicitly one can show that the energy conservation implies@xmath120 in which @xmath121 is the area of the throat and @xmath122if we assume that there exists an equilibrium radius @xmath123 where the throat of the wormhole is at rest with no acceleration , i.e. , @xmath124 the energy density and lateral pressure become static . at such equilibrium condition one obtains@xmath125and@xmath126 in which a sub@xmath127 stands for the equilibrium state .",
    "therefore if the radius of the throat is set to be @xmath123 we may consider the wormhole to be at equilibrium but it may not be a stable state .",
    "therefore we perturb the throat which means we apply a force and change the radius of the throat .",
    "if after the perturbation the throat tends to go back to its initial equilibrium point we shall define the wormhole to be stable , otherwise unstable . to see if the throat goes back to its equilibrium point or not , one has to write an equation of motion for the throat .",
    "this equation is extracted from the dynamic expression of @xmath128 given by eq .",
    "hence , by rearranging the terms in ( 42 ) we find a one - dimensional classical motion of the form@xmath129where @xmath130to go further one has to identify @xmath128 as a function of @xmath131 this can be achieved by considering an equation of state ( eos ) for the fluid presented on the shell . here in this study we consider a linear eos of the form @xmath132 in which @xmath133 is a constant",
    ". eos ( 50 ) and the energy conservation ( 44 ) can be combined to find an explicit expression for @xmath128 .",

    "the regions labeled by @xmath138 are the stable part of the parameters .",

    "2 we plot the potential @xmath147 versus @xmath4 for certain values of parameters which are given in its caption .",
    "we observe that for small perturbation @xmath161 is a local stable equilibrium point for all different cases . as a function of proper time the throat radius @xmath162",

    "it is observed that this provides a stable , i.e. oscillatory radius wormhole within certain range of initial velocities .",
    "( 2 ) justifies explicitly the stability property since the radius is confined in between two high potential barriers .",
    "in einstein s general relativity wormholes / thin - shell wormholes have two characteristic features that often attract criticism .",
    "the first is the occurrence of negative energy density which , with the exception of some alternative works @xcite is almost taken for granted while the second concerns about the stability of such structures .",
    "our aim in this paper was to consider einstein s gravity solutions with a scalar charge and investigate whether stable wormholes can be established .",
    "to this end we presented first an infinite class of solutions with well - known limits .",
    "remarkably it is found that scalar charge ( @xmath11 ) gives rise to stability regions for the underlying thin - shell wormholes .",
    "small linear perturbation within certain limits of initial velocity is shown to keep the thin - shell wormhole stable .",
    "arbitrary perturbations , expectedly , either collapses or evaporates the wormhole . not only through perturbations but",
    "finely tuned einstein - scalar thin - shell wormholes also can be established which are eternally stable in their deep potential well .",
    "it is our strong belief that similar results hold also in @xmath2dimensions , however , the technical details may not be as straightforward as in the present @xmath0dimensional case ."
