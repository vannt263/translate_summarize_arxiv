    "in the inflationary scenario the universe initially expands quasi - exponentially in a vacuum - like state with vanishing entropy and particle number densities . at the stage of inflation ,",
    "all energy is concentrated in a classical slowly moving inflaton field @xmath0 .",
    "consider a simple chaotic inflation .",
    "the fundamental lagrangian @xmath4 contains the inflaton part with the potential @xmath5 and other fields @xmath6 which give subdominant contributions to gravity . the friedmann equation for a scalar factor @xmath7 : @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) and the klein - gordon equation for @xmath10 : @xmath11 define the evolution of the background fields .",
    "soon after the end of inflation , an almost homogeneous inflaton field @xmath10 coherently oscillates with a very large amplitude of the order of the planck mass @xmath12 .",
    "this scalar field can be considered as a coherent superposition of @xmath0-quasiparticles with zero momenta , _ inflatons _ at rest .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations gradually decreases not only because of the expansion of the universe , but also because of the energy transfer to particles created by the oscillating field . at this stage",
    "we shall invoke the rest of the fundamental lagrangian @xmath4 which includes the other bosons and fermions and their interactions with the inflaton field , as well as the self - interaction of the inflaton field .",
    "these interactions lead to the creation of many ultra - relativistic particles from inflatons . in this scenario",
    "all the matter constituting the universe would be created from this process of reheating . a toy model describing the interaction between inflatons and other massless bose particles @xmath13 will be @xmath14 .",
    "gradually , the inflaton field decays and transfers all of its energy non - adiabatically to the created particles .",
    "if the creation of particles is sufficiently slow , the particles would simultaneously interact with each other and come to a state of thermal equilibrium at the reheating temperature @xmath15 .",
    "this gradual reheating can be treated with the perturbative theory of particle creation and thermalization . that elementary theory of reheating was developed long ago with the first models of inflation .",
    "consider the heisenberg representation of the quantum scalar field @xmath16 , with the eigenfunctions @xmath17 with comoving momenta @xmath18 .",
    "the temporal part of the eigenfunction obeys the equation @xmath19 with the vacuum - like initial condition @xmath20 in the far past .",
    "the coupling to the curvature @xmath21 will not be important .",
    "let us seek the solutions of eq .",

    "an iterative solution + @xmath27 gives the standard result of the perturbative theory for the particle occupation number @xmath28 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a pair of inflatons decaying independently into a pair of @xmath13-particles , @xmath29 . the largest total decay rate in the perturbative reheating is @xmath30 ; the upper bound on the perturbative reheating temperature is @xmath31 gev .",
    "recently it was found , however , that in many versions of chaotic inflation reheating begins with a stage of parametric resonance@xmath32 . indeed , in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) inflatons act not as separate particles , but as a the coherently oscillating field @xmath10 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath33 alone does not necessarily correspond to small @xmath34 .",
    "the oscillating effective frequency @xmath35 can result in a broad parametric amplification of @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the energy is rapidly transferred from the inflaton field to other bose fields interacting with it .",
    "this process occurs far away from thermal equilibrium , and therefore we called it _ preheating_. because of the non - perturbative character of the particle creation , the theory of preheating is rather complicated .",
    "+ reheating is an intermediate stage between inflation and the hot radiation dominated universe .",
    "therefore , during or around reheating one can expect initial conditions for many parameters of the big bang to be settled : the initial temperature @xmath15 , baryogenesis , relic monopoles and others topological defects , primordial black holes , dark matter relics , etc .",
    "recent developments in the theory of reheating show that the stage of preheating can significantly change the way we think about these problems .    among many exciting topics in preheating ,",
    "i have selected a particular issue for these proceedings : how diverse the character of the parametric resonance can be in different models of @xmath5 , and how it can be unified .",
    "this information is vital for finding the leading channel of the inflaton decay .",
    "the answers are based on a study done in collaboration with andrei linde ( stanford ) , alexei starobinsky ( moscow ) and patrick greene ( hawaii)@xmath37 . this work was supported by nsf grant no .",
    "ast95 - 29 - 225 .",
    "it turns out that the character of the parametric resonance for the general equation ( [ 2 ] ) depends on the character of the classical oscillations @xmath10 , i.e. , on the shape of the effective inflaton potential @xmath5 .",
    "we begin with the quadratic potential @xmath39 .",
    "the background solution corresponds to sinusoidal oscillations @xmath40 , with the amplitude @xmath41 decreasing as the universe expands with the scalar factor @xmath42 .",
    "+ for a the toy model the expansion of the universe is neglected ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , the equation for the fluctuations takes the form of a mathieu equation @xmath46 with a new time variable @xmath47 and the essential dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the properties of the solutions of the mathieu equation are well represented by its stability / instability chart ; see fig .  1 .",
    "= 5.6 cm +    there is an exponential instability @xmath49 within the set of resonance bands .",
    "this instability corresponds to an exponential growth in the occupation number of created particles @xmath50 . since @xmath51",
    ", it is expected that @xmath52 , the parametric resonance is broad .",
    "the simple standard methods for finding the characteristic exponent @xmath53 in the narrow resonance regime @xmath54 do not work here .",
    "however , we made the following observation@xmath55 : for large @xmath56 the eigenfunction @xmath57 is changing adiabatically between the moments @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where the inflaton field is equal to zero @xmath60 .",
    "the non - adiabatic changes of @xmath57 occur only in the vicinity of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the semiclassical solution ( [ 3 ] ) is valid everywhere but around @xmath58 .",
    "let the wave @xmath57 have the form of the wkb solution with the pair of coefficients @xmath61 before the scattering at the point @xmath58 ; and the pair @xmath62 after the scattering at @xmath58 .",
    "the interaction term around all the points @xmath58 is parabolic @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the outgoing amplitudes @xmath64 can be expressed through the incoming amplitudes @xmath65 with help of the well - known reflection @xmath66 and transmission @xmath67 amplitudes for scattering from a parabolic potential at @xmath58 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , the phase accumulated by the moment @xmath70 is @xmath71 , and a scaled momentum @xmath72 .",

    "the effect of parametric resonance crucially depends on the interference of the wave functions , i.e. , the phase correlation / anticorrelation between successive scatterings at the parabolic potentials . the maximal value of @xmath84 is reached for the positive interference when @xmath85 and is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath84 corresponds to @xmath87 and is equal to @xmath88 . for the negative interference",
    "when @xmath89 there is no resonance .",
    "the angle @xmath90 is mainly controlled by the phase @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider now an expanding universe . at first glance ,",
    "the resonant solution here is more complicated than the mathieu equation , which for @xmath92 has only a heuristic meaning for our problem .",
    "the most important change is the time - dependence of the parameter @xmath93 : @xmath94 ; @xmath95 is the number of inflaton oscillations . for the broad resonance case",
    "this parameter significantly varies within a few inflaton oscillations ; hence , the concept of the static stability / instability chart and the results for the mathieu equation can not be utilized here .",
    "surprisingly , the most interesting case , when the parameter @xmath56 is large _ and _ time - varying , can also be treated analytically by the method of successive parabolic scatterings .",
    "indeed , the matrix mapping ( [ 7 ] ) for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 is also valid in the case of an expanded universe .",
    "the phase accumulating between two successive zeros of the inflaton field is now @xmath98 . for large initial values of @xmath56 , the phase rotation between successive scatterings",
    "@xmath99 is much larger than @xmath100 for all relevant @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the phase @xmath90 in formula ( [ 8 ] ) can be considered to be random numbers . since there is no memory of the phases ,",
    "each mapping ( [ 7 ] ) can be considered as independent of the previous ones . as a result",
    "the number of particles @xmath101 and the exponent @xmath53 are random variables .",
    "the functional form of @xmath53 for the stochastic resonance is different from that for the broad parametric resonance , in ( [ 8 ] ) one has substitute a random phase @xmath102 in the interval @xmath103 $ ] instead of @xmath90 .",
    "an example of a stochastic @xmath53 is plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "+ contrary to the regular resonance , the stochastic resonance is much broader , there are no distinguished stability / instability bands , and for certain values of momenta the function @xmath104 is negative . during the stochastic resonance regime",
    ", this function changes dramatically with every half period of the inflaton oscillations .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows that it is incorrect to use the structure of the resonance bands of the static mathieu equation for investigation of the stage of stochastic resonance , unless the parameter @xmath56 drops to a value @xmath105 .",
    "in the theory with the potential @xmath107 it is convenient to use the conformal field @xmath108 and conformal time variable @xmath109 .",
    "then ( without decay ) the amplitude of @xmath110 is constant , @xmath111 .",
    "the background solution is given by an elliptic function @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) for quantum fluctuations @xmath36 can be simplified in this theory .",
    "indeed , the physical momentum , @xmath114 is redshifted in the same manner as the background field amplitude",
    ". the conformal transformation of the mode function @xmath115 allows one to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "the equation for fluctuations does not depend on the expansion of the universe and is completely reduced to the similar problem in minkowski space - time .",
    "this is a special feature of the conformal theory @xmath118 .",
    "the mode equation ( [ 10 ] ) belongs to the class of lam equations . since the coefficients of the lam equation ( [ 10 ] )",
    "are time - independent , we can numerically construct the stability / instability chart in the variables @xmath119 , plotted in fig .",
    "1 . the combination of parameters @xmath120 ultimately defines the structure of the parametric resonance in this theory .",
    "this means that the condition of a broad parametric resonance does not require a large initial amplitude of the inflaton field , as for the quadratic potential .",
    "the strength of the resonance depends non - monotonically on this parameter .",
    "preheating in the theory @xmath121 is efficient only if @xmath122 .",
    "the inflaton amplitude @xmath123 is extremely large immediately after inflation , @xmath124 , and later it decreases as @xmath125 . the parameter @xmath56 , which controls the resonance , rapidly changes . as a result ,",
    "the broad parametric resonance regime in this theory is a stochastic process . in the theory",
    "@xmath126 the inflaton field @xmath0 also decreases in an expanding universe , but it does not make the resonance stochastic because all variables scale in the same way as @xmath0 due to the conformal invariance of the model .",
    "the parameter which controls the strength of the resonance is @xmath127 .",
    "what is the relation between these two theories ?",
    "neither of these two theories is completely general . in the theory of the massive scalar field",
    "one may expect terms @xmath128 to appear because of radiative corrections . on the other hand , in many realistic theories",
    "the effective potential is quadratic with respect to @xmath0 near the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "let us consider the theory @xmath129 which embraces both limits .",
    "= 5.4 cm +    one may expect that for @xmath130 the mass term @xmath131 does not affect the frequency of oscillations of the inflaton field @xmath0 , and the parametric resonance in this theory occurs in the same way as in the conformal theory , whereas for @xmath132 the resonance develops as in the massive theory .",
    "therefore , a naive thought would be that as the amplitude @xmath123 decreases from @xmath133 to @xmath134 , the parametric resonance can be described with the lam stability / instability chart .",
    "it turns out that the actual criterion for the regular , stable resonance is that the phase of the @xmath36-wave between two zeros of inflaton oscillations , @xmath135 is not rotating . the phase rotation within an inflaton half - period is @xmath136 .",
    "this means that despite the subdominant contribution of the mass term , for large @xmath137 its presence can modify the nature of the lam resonance by turning it into stochastic process if @xmath138 .",
    "different regimes of parametric resonance are shown in fig .",
    "[ resranges ] . immediately after inflation",
    "the amplitude @xmath123 is greater than @xmath134 . if @xmath139 , the @xmath13-particles are produced in the regular resonance regime until @xmath140 decreases to @xmath141 , after which the resonance occurs as in the theory @xmath142 .",
    "the resonance never becomes stochastic .",
    "if @xmath143 , the resonance originally develops as in the conformal theory , but with a decrease of @xmath140 the resonance becomes stochastic .",
    "again , for @xmath144 the resonance occurs as in the theory @xmath145 .",
    "there is a transient regime of intermittancy between regular ( stable ) and stochastic resonances . in all cases",
    "the resonance eventually disappears when the field @xmath140 becomes sufficiently small and is replaced by the perturbative decay .",
    "perturbative reheating can be complete only if there is symmetry breaking in the theory , or additional interactions with fermions@xmath146 .",
