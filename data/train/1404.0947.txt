    "recently , a narrow resonance - like structure has been observed in the reaction @xmath7 and @xmath8 at a mass @xmath9 gev with width @xmath10 mev  @xcite , which indicates the existence of an @xmath11 sub - threshold @xmath12 resonance , called @xmath13 in the literature .",
    "additional evidences had been found in the exclusive measurements of the quasi - free @xmath14 reaction  @xcite .",
    "a. pricking @xmath15 suggested that if this observed resonance structure constitutes an @xmath16channel resonance in the @xmath17 system , then it should cause distinctive consequences in @xmath17 scattering  @xcite .",
    "then they added the resonance amplitude in the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) partial wave analysis , estimated the resonance effect in @xmath17 scattering and found that the resonance effect improves considerably the description of total cross section of @xmath17 scattering and the vector analyzing power @xmath18 exhibits the largest sensitivity to the resonance .",
    "high precision data are needed for the energy region @xmath19 gev to have a crucial test of the resonance hypothesis .",
    "such measurements have actually been carried out very recently with the wasa detector at cosy , in which the @xmath17 analyzing power @xmath18 was measured over a large angular range  @xcite . incorporating the new @xmath18 data into the said analysis produces a pole in the @xmath0 - @xmath1 partial waves as expected from the @xmath13 resonance hypothesis .",
    "the possibility of @xmath20 dibaryon state was first proposed by dyson and xuong in 1964  @xcite , in which a bound @xmath12 state was predicted to lie at @xmath21 mev .",
    "goldman @xmath15",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath13 should be bound in any qcd based quark model that incorporates color confinement , hyperfine color - magnetic interaction and quark delocalization .",
    "they called it inevitable nonstrange dibaryon d*. the recent three - body faddeev equation calculation supports the existence of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "m. bashkanov @xmath15 further pointed out that the observation of the @xmath13 resonance state will rewarm the search of other novel six - quark configurations allowed by qcd  @xcite .",
    "our former calculations showed that the @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath13 is a tightly bound six - quark system rather than a loosely bound nucleus - like system of two @xmath24s  @xcite .",
    "recently , our group calculated the resonance mass and decay width of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath12 states and showed that the @xmath25 @xmath12 resonance is a promising candidate for the recent observed one in the so - called abc - effect  @xcite . however , where we only calculate the @xmath13 resonance in the @xmath0 partial wave of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath27 ) scattering  @xcite . whether there is a resonance structure in the coupled @xmath0 - @xmath1 partial waves of nucleon - nucleon scattering as expected in ref",

    "this article reports the results of a channel coupling calculation of the @xmath22 @xmath27 scattering in the coupled @xmath0 - @xmath1 partial waves with and without the @xmath2 @xmath28 structure .    the direct use of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , in nucleon - nucleon interaction is still out of reach of the present techniques , although the lattice qcd has made a considerable progress recently  @xcite .",
    "qcd - inspired quark models are still the main approach to study the baryon - baryon interaction . in our former study of the nucleon - nucleon scattering and the @xmath13 resonance state ,",
    "two quark models were used : one is the chiral quark model ( chqm )  @xcite , in which the @xmath29 meson is indispensable to provide the intermediate - range attraction ; the other is the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm )  @xcite , which has been developed with the aim to understand the well - known similarities between nuclear and molecular forces despite the obvious energy and length scale differences . in this model",
    ", the intermediate - range attraction is achieved by the quark delocalization , which is like the electron percolation in the molecules .",
    "the color screening is needed to make the quark delocalization feasible and it might be an effective description of the hidden color channel coupling  @xcite .",
    "both two models have been successfully applied to hadron spectroscopy and @xmath27 interaction . in this work",
    ", we use these two quark models to study the resonance structure in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the coupled @xmath0 - @xmath1 partial waves of @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "a brief introduction of two quark models is given in section ii .",
    "section iii devotes to the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "the two quark models : chiral quark model and quark delocalization color screening model , have been used in our previous work to study the @xmath27 n - hyperon interaction and dibaryon  @xcite .",
    "the details of two models can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    ", only the hamiltonians and parameters are given .",
    "the hamiltonian of qdcsm has the same form as eq.(1 ) , but without @xmath29 meson exchange and a phenomenological color screening confinement potential is used , @xmath37+v^{c , ls}_{ij } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "is realized by replacing the left- and right - centered gaussian functions , the single - particle orbital wave functions in the usual quark cluster model , @xmath39 with delocalized ones , @xmath40    the parameters of two models are fixed by baryon and deuteron properties and/or nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts , they are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    ".parameters of quark models [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ channels ]    we first discuss the results from qdcsm .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the experimental information used for the comparison is the partial waves solution sp07  @xcite .",
    "= 3.7 in    = 3.7 in    firstly , we do a single channel calculation for the phase shifts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 partial waves of @xmath27 scattering , which are denoted by the solid lines in figs . 1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively .",
    "no resonance structure can be found in both two channels as expected .",
    "both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering phase shifts fit the sp07 data well , especially for the low energy scattering , @xmath41 mev . for @xmath6 partial wave ,",
    "the phase shifts at high energy , @xmath42 , deviate from the sp07 data , which rise up slowly .",
    "secondly , two - channel coupling calculations are performed .",
    "the state @xmath4 is added in the phase shift calculations of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 partial waves of @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "( 1a ) by the dashed line . from fig .",
    "1(a ) we can see that the channel coupling of @xmath4 has minor effects on phase shifts of @xmath5 for @xmath41 mev , but it causes that the phase shifts rise through @xmath43 at a resonance mass @xmath44 mev . for @xmath6 phase shifts ,",
    "there is no coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath4 , so the channel coupling phase shifts is exactly the same as the single channel ones .",
    "the reason for this is that , if only the two - body interactions are used , as our two quark models assumed , the two - body tensor interaction can only induce a @xmath46 change at a time .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 can not couple to @xmath6 directly , and the @xmath47 state must go through the intermediate @xmath5 channel to affect the @xmath45 channel . to verify this point , we do the following calculations .",
    "thirdly , we calculate the phase shifts of the coupled @xmath5 and @xmath6 partial waves .",
    "the phase shifts of @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering are denoted by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig.1(b ) , respectively .",
    "obviously , there is no resonance structure in any channel as expected .",
    "by coupling to @xmath6 , the phase shifts of @xmath5 fit the sp07 data better than the pure @xmath5 does .",
    "however , the coupling to @xmath5 push down the phase shifts of @xmath6 from the sp07 data a little .",
    "fourthly , we include the @xmath4 state in the phase shift calculation of coupled @xmath5 and @xmath6 partial waves .",
    "the phase shifts of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are denoted by the dash - dotted lines in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively .",
    "we find that there is a remarkable resonance structure in the @xmath5 partial wave , whereas in the @xmath6 phase shifts , there is only a small bump around the resonance energy .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent observations of the wasa - at - cosy collaboration , in which @xmath5 wave obtained a typical resonance shape , whereas the @xmath6 wave changed less dramatically  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can see the effect of @xmath4 on the phase shifts of @xmath6 clearly .",
    "it proceeds through the intermediate channel @xmath5 .    finally , we give the mixing angles of the coupled @xmath5 and @xmath6 partial waves in fig .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves denote the result without ( with ) the resonance state @xmath4 in the coupled @xmath5 and @xmath6 partial waves . a valley and a peak around the resonance energy appear by including the resonance state @xmath4 .",
    "then we do the same calculations by using another quark model chqm .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the meaning of the curves are the same as those in fig .",
    "1 . from fig .",
    "2 , we find that all the results are consistent with the ones from qdcsm . only the resonance mass moves to @xmath48 mev , which is higher than the observed one and that in qdcsm by @xmath49 mev .    in order to compare our results with the recent observations of the wasa - at - cosy collaboration  @xcite",
    ", we show the @xmath5 and @xmath6 amplitudes including their mixing amplitude @xmath50 for the two quark models in fig .",
    "3 . from fig .",
    "3(a ) , we can see that the @xmath5 partial wave obtains a typical resonance structure in both models , which is consistent with ref .",
    "but the resonance mass is @xmath44 mev in qdcsm , @xmath48 mev in chqm , a little lower and higher than @xmath51 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite . from fig .",
    "3(b ) , we can see that both quark models give similar amplitudes of the @xmath6 partial wave .",
    "although there are small structures around the resonance energy , the theoretical results are different from the experimental ones .",
    "the real part of amplitude in model calculation rises a little after the resonance energy , whereas the experimental ones fall down . for imaginary part",
    ", we have a total inversed results .",
    "the amplitude falls down a little in theoretical calculation and rises in experimental measurement  @xcite . for the mixing amplitude @xmath50 as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , the real parts of the partial wave in two quark models are consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a valley around the resonance energy , whereas the imaginary parts in both models are different from that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , inspired by the recent results of the wasa - at - cosy collaboration , where they did a partial wave analysis including the new @xmath52 scattering data and found a resonance pole in the coupled @xmath0 and @xmath1 partial waves as expected from the @xmath13 resonance hypothesis , we study the @xmath13 resonance structure in the coupled @xmath0 - @xmath1 partial waves of @xmath27 scattering in the framework of qdcsm and chqm .",
    "our results show that there is indeed a resonance in the coupled @xmath5 - @xmath6 partial waves due to the coupling of the @xmath4 state , which is consistent with the existence of the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the resonance structure in the @xmath5 partial wave is remarkable , whereas in the @xmath6 phase shifts there is only a small bump around the resonance energy .",
    "this result is also consistent with the recent observations of the wasa - at - cosy collaboration  @xcite . from our calculation",
    ", one can see that the small bump in the phase shifts of @xmath1 partial wave of @xmath27 scattering is an indication of the existence of a resonance , @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , qdcsm and chqm obtained similar results .",
    "only the mass and decay width of the @xmath13 resonance in qdcsm are smaller than that in chqm .",
    "it shows once again the consistency of these two quark models even though they have different intermediate - range attraction mechanisms .",
    "our former study has shown that by including the hidden - color channels in chqm , the resonance masses are lowered by 10 - 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "this fact inferred that the quark delocalization and color screening used in qdcsm might be an effective description of the hidden color channel coupling .    for the partial wave amplitudes ,",
    "the behavior of the theoretical calculated ones are different from the measured ones .",
    "the further study is needed .",
