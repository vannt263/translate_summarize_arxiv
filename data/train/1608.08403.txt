    "when the nonlocal quantum correlations become important in a many - level system , one may not extract the complete information about individual sub - levels although the total information about the whole system is known .",
    "in such a case , sub - levels become strongly correlated with each other , and this fact may allow the information between two distant points ( such as two qubits separated by large distances ) to be communicated instantly . this phenomenon is called action at a distance , and such a pair of sub - levels is called entangled . formerly ,",
    "einstein and his co - authors @xcite , as well as schrdinger @xcite argued that this `` spooky action at a distance '' is a direct consequence of incomplete nature of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , after three decades , bell @xcite showed that einstein s realist idea based on the locality is wrong and it pioneered consecutive experimental realizations which proved that the predictions of quantum mechanics are true regarding the entanglement phenomenon as a nonlocal property of nature .    during the last two decades",
    ", a great many experimental efforts have been devoted to entanglement phenomenon in a wide variety of physical systems including entanglement of many photons , mesoscopic systems , and so on @xcite .",
    "hensen et al .",
    "@xcite very recently produced 245 entangled pairs of electrons ( which were 1.3 kilometers apart from each other ) in nine days .",
    "they reported that their results rule out large classes of local realist theories . on the other hand ,",
    "in the theoretical ground , it was quite a challenge to measure the amount of entanglement between two correlated sub - systems @xcite .",
    "the two distinct measures to distinguish between entangled and separable states are concurrence @xcite and negativity @xcite .",
    "one should notice that concurrence can not be used as a criterion for separability condition for the systems with dimensions larger than @xmath7 in hilbert space . using concurrence as a measure of entanglement between two qubits , models based on localized spins in the form of ising , xy and isotropic , as well as anisotropic heisenberg systems",
    "have been widely investigated in the literature @xcite . in order to observe entanglement phenomenon in such systems , selected hamiltonian should include either off - diagonal terms such as anisotropic exchange coupling and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , and/or inhomogeneous external magnetic fields along the ising axis .",
    "apart from these , pairwise entanglement in the systems with three or more qubits @xcite have also been studied in the forms of xx , xy and heisenberg models , as well as in the forms of their varieties . according to these works ,",
    "some important findings can be listed as follows : under certain conditions , next - nearest - neighbor entanglement may be larger than nearest - neighbor entanglement near zero temperature @xcite . as the number of qubits becomes larger than a larger value of external homogeneous magnetic field",
    "is needed to observe entanglement .",
    "however , entanglement disappears shortly after the field exceeds some critical value @xcite .",
    "moreover , isotropic heisenberg spin chain exhibits non - zero concurrence only when the exchange coupling is of antiferromagnetic type @xcite whereas if one applies a magnetic field then the su(2 ) symmetry is broken and it becomes possible for a ferromagnetic isotropic heisenberg chain to have thermal and ground states which are completely entangled @xcite . for xx qubit rings with periodic boundary conditions , ref.@xcite also realized that pairwise entanglement between the nearest - neighbor qubits is invariant under the magnetic field reversal @xmath8 , and that for the same model containing `` even number of qubits '' , bipartite thermal entanglement between neighboring sites should be independent of both the sign of magnetic fields and exchange constants .",
    "@xcite showed for isotropic heisenberg model that the ground state entanglement becomes enhanced ( diminished ) with increasing number of qubits in odd ( even)-numbered qubit rings .",
    "it is also possible to distinguish between thermally entangled and separable states via examining macroscopic properties such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility which can play the role of some kind of entanglement witness @xcite .",
    "there are also some other works dealing with entanglement properties of qubit - qutrit and qutrit - qutrit chains @xcite . in an extended work , wang et al .",
    "@xcite studied the entanglement in a spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath9 ferrimagnetic chain in which they reported that as the magnitude of spin-@xmath9 increases then the temperature value at which entanglement vanishes becomes higher whereas the ground state thermal entanglement for small-@xmath9 chains is enhanced .",
    "similarly , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that threshold temperature at which entanglement vanishes increases with increasing spin magnitude .    in practice ,",
    "it is a difficult task to control the entanglement in a system by manipulating the exchange interactions , and in some cases , the control of the magnitude and direction of externally applied magnetic field proved useful for tuning the entanglement of a spin chain @xcite . therefore , in the present paper , our aim is to clarify the entanglement phenomena in @xmath6 qubit @xmath1 and @xmath2 chains in the presence of magnetic fields applied in both longitudinal ( i.e. easy axis ) and transverse ( hard axis ) directions .",
    "the outline of the paper can be summarized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] we define our model .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] . finally sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider 1d heisenberg @xmath1 and @xmath2 spin chain systems consisting of @xmath6 spin-1/2 particles interacting with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "each qubit in the system is under the influence of a polarized magnetic field applied in @xmath3 plane . within the open boundary condition",
    ", the hamiltonian of a such system can be described as follows : @xmath10+h_{x}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_{i}^{x}+h_{z}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_{i}^{z}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pauli spin operators at the site @xmath13 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are spin - spin exchange interaction terms of the @xmath16 and @xmath4 components of two neighboring spins which are selected to be as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , antiferromagnetic type interaction . throughout the work ,",
    "we have fixed the total number of particle @xmath0 and value of spin - spin interaction @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the components of the external polarized field . here ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the amplitude of the field and the angle between the field and its corresponding component of the pauli spin operators , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the first summation is over the nearest neighbor qubits while the second and third ones are over all of the qubits .",
    "the hamiltonian considered here covers @xmath1 model with @xmath24 and isotropic heisenberg model with @xmath25 in the limit cases .",
    "there are several studies in the literature regarding the limit cases and some variants of the model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the system in thermal equilibrium can be obtained via the density matrix operator , which can be defined as follows : @xmath26 here @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the temperature and boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the partition function which is defined by the trace of the density matrix as @xmath31 .",
    "the basic strategy for obtaining the concurrence ( as a measure of bipartite entanglement ) for two qubits ( say @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is , constructing the reduced density matrix by tracing out the other spins , and calculating @xmath34 via @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath37 which is obtained by @xmath38 in descending order . here",
    ", @xmath39 is the @xmath40 component of the pauli spin matrix related to the spin @xmath41 , @xmath42 is reduced density matrix , and @xmath43 denotes the complex conjugation . the value of concurrence varies from @xmath44 for a separable state ( no entanglement ) to @xmath45 for a maximally entangled state .",
    "in this section , we will focus our attention on the thermal entanglement properties of the @xmath0 qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 heisenberg spin chains under the existence of a polarized magnetic field .",
    "we especially study the pairwise entanglement between central qubit and its nearest neighbor entanglement @xmath46 and as well as next - nearest entanglement @xmath47 to show how the applied magnetic fields , interaction constant of the @xmath4 component and the temperature affect the natures of entanglement features of the system . for this aim",
    ", the boundaries in related planes separating entangled and non - entangled regions will be given for the selected hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the physical mechanisms underlying of these types of observations will be discussed in detail .",
    "depending on the considered hamiltonian parameters , in the entangled region , the concurrence has a non - zero value corresponding to the presence of a strongly correlated two qubit pair .",
    "contrary to this , concurrence vanishes in the non - entangled region . keeping these facts in mind , we illustrate the boundaries in the @xmath48 contour map in figs .",
    "1(a - d ) with varying @xmath5 parameters such as @xmath49 ( a ) , 0.5 ( b ) , 1.0 ( c ) and 1.5 ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the figures are presented for the nearest - neighbor concurrence @xmath46 , and for the relatively low value of temperature , i.e. for @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig1](a ) that along the @xmath51 axis , when the value of @xmath52 increases starting from zero , the concurrence @xmath46 tends to rise until it reaches a certain value for a given temperature .",
    "then , @xmath46 begins to decrease with further increment in value of @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , as the value of @xmath52 is sufficiently large , the entanglement between qubits @xmath53 and @xmath54 disappears , hence , @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "these behaviors appear symmetrically at two sides of @xmath55 . along the @xmath56 axis ,",
    "magnetic field dependency @xmath57 of @xmath46 exhibits a nearly similar character to the previous one mentioned above .",
    "the only difference is that the entanglement between qubits @xmath53 and @xmath54 still lives as the value of @xmath58 is sufficiently too large .",
    "figures [ fig1](b - d ) show effect of the interaction constant @xmath5 on the thermal entanglement character of @xmath46 .     for varying values of the @xmath5 ratio such as ( a ) @xmath49 , ( b ) 0.5 , ( c ) 1.0 and ( d ) 1.5 , respectively .",
    "the figures are plotted for the value of @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for varying values of the @xmath5 ratio such as ( a ) @xmath49 , ( b ) 0.5 , ( c ) 1.0 and ( d ) 1.5 , respectively . the figures are plotted for the value of @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for varying values of the @xmath5 ratio such as ( a ) @xmath49 , ( b ) 0.5 , ( c ) 1.0 and ( d ) 1.5 , respectively .",

    "as the value of @xmath5 is too large , much more energy originating from magnetic fields is needed to drive the system from entangled state to non - entangled one .",
    "the aforementioned situations can be easily seen by comparing the figures [ fig1](a - d ) with each other .",
    "the findings also demonstrate that the geometrical shape where the entanglement character exists sensitively depends on the selected @xmath5 parameter .",
    "for instance , figures [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) present an elliptical shape whereas the figure ( c ) shows a circular shape entanglement character .",
    "however , as depicted in figure [ fig1](d ) , the general trend of entanglement character again becomes elliptical with further increment in value of @xmath5 .",
    "for the same hamiltonian parameters with figure ( [ fig1]).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the same hamiltonian parameters with figure ( [ fig1]).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the same hamiltonian parameters with figure ( [ fig1]).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the same hamiltonian parameters with figure ( [ fig1]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure [ fig2](a - d ) , we examine thermal entanglement features of the next - nearest neighbor concurrence @xmath47 of nine - qubit system for the same hamiltonian parameters with figure ( [ fig1 ] ) . in contrary to the figure [ fig1 ] , in the absence of polarized magnetic field , there is no entanglement behavior between qubits @xmath53 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , increment in strength of the magnetic field gives rise to the existence of an entanglement character .",
    "next , as the strength of applied magnetic field is increased further , @xmath53 and @xmath59 qubits become non - entangled . the mechanism briefly mentioned here is often called the re - entrant type entanglement behavior . we should indicate that there are several studies in the literature showing a re - entrant type entanglement character @xcite .",
    "in order to elucidate the temperature influences on the entanglement properties of the studied system , we plot figures ( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) corresponding to the concurrences @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the figures are demonstrated for the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the raising temperature shows a tendency to reduce and destruct the quantum correlations between the considered qubits for the fixed sets of hamiltonian parameters .",
    "if one compares the figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) with each other , it can be easily seen that the concurrence @xmath46 prominently decreases when the value of temperature is increased because the thermal energy is dominant against the spin - spin interactions .",
    "we should also note that although an increment in the value of temperature causes a quantitative change in concurrence @xmath46 , it does not lead to a change in characteristic behavior .",
    "it is beneficial to notice that similar type observations originating from the thermal agitations have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where ground state and finite temperature features of two qubit system under the influence of a polarized magnetic field have been discussed in detail .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the figures ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) with each other , it is possible to say that when the temperature increases from @xmath50 to @xmath61 , unusual and interesting thermal entanglement behaviors occur in next - nearest neighbor concurrence @xmath47 .",
    "these dramatic changes have emerged at the relatively low values of @xmath5 such as for @xmath49 and @xmath61 .",
    "for example , non - entangled region expands in @xmath62 and @xmath55 plane as well as a re - entrant type entanglement character takes place along the @xmath63 lines .",
    "it means that the considered qubits are dragged from non - entangled region to entangled region with increasing value of magnetic field @xmath55 .",
    "then , as the energy arising from the magnetic field is increased further , the system displays opposite behavior than the previous one discussed above .     for varying values of the @xmath5 ratio such as ( a ) @xmath49 , ( b ) 0.5 , ( c ) 1.0 and ( d ) 1.5 , respectively .",
    "the figures are plotted for the value of @xmath60.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for varying values of the @xmath5 ratio such as ( a ) @xmath49 , ( b ) 0.5 , ( c ) 1.0 and ( d ) 1.5 , respectively .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the thermal entanglement properties of @xmath0 qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 heisenberg spin chains within the open boundary condition by making use of concurrence concept .",
    "we design the system such that each qubit in the chain is exposed to the polarized magnetic field in @xmath3 plane . according to our detailed investigation",
    ", the most conspicuous findings mentioned in the present study can be listed as follows .",
    "the boundaries which separate the entangled and non - entangled regions sensitively depend upon the spin - spin interaction term of the @xmath4 component of two neighboring spins @xmath5 , temperature as well as polarized magnetic field components .",
    "for example , @xmath5 parameter plays a crucial role in improving the entanglement depending on the other hamiltonian parameters .",
    "it allows us to control the amount of the entanglement between the selected pair of qubits by varying the value of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to realize a magnetically stimulated entanglement behavior by selecting the suitable system parameters . by changing the value of polarized magnetic field ,",
    "one may create or destruct the quantum correlations between the pair of qubits .",
    "it has also been found that the present system presents a re - entrant type thermal entanglement character depending on the considered system parameters if one considers the next - nearest neighbor pair of qubits .",
    "finally , we deal with the finite temperature influences on the entanglement character of system , and the raising temperature demonstrate a tendency to shrink the quantum correlations between the considered qubits for the fixed sets of hamiltonian parameters .",

    "<S> we elucidate the finite temperature entanglement properties of @xmath0 qubits heisenberg @xmath1 and @xmath2 models under the presence of a polarized magnetic field in @xmath3 plane by means of concurrence concept . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic analysis for a wide range of the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the global phase regions which separate the entangled and non - entangled regions sensitively depend upon the spin - spin interaction term of the @xmath4 component of two neighboring spins @xmath5 , temperature as well as polarized magnetic field components . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , we think that polarized magnetic field can be used a control parameter to determine the amount of thermal entanglement between pair of qubits for different temperatures and spin - spin interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been found that the nearest - neighbor pair of qubits does not point out a re - entrant type entanglement character when one only deals with the nearest - neighbor pair of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> however , as one considers next - nearest neighbor pair of qubits , it is possible to see the evidences of re - entrant type entanglement behaviors </S>",
