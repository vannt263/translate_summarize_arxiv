    "in the first few months the historical detection of 24 neutrinos in the underground facilities of the kamiokande , imb , and baksan laboratories caused hectic activity among scientists from very different fields . in the subsequent years",
    "the scene was dominated by the rise and slow decay of light emission in all wavelengths which followed the outbreak of the supernova shock and contained a flood of data about the structure of the progenitor star and the dynamics of the explosion .",
    "now that the direct emission has settled down to a rather low level , the supernova light which is reflected from circumstellar structures provides insight into the progenitor s evolution .",
    "even more information about the latter can be expected when the supernova shock hits the inner ring in a few years .",
    "the neutrino detections in connection with sn  1987a were the final proof that neutrinos take up the bulk of the energy during stellar core collapse and neutron star formation .",
    "lightcurve and spectra of sn  1987a bear clear evidence of large - scale mixing in the stellar mantle and envelope and of fast moving ni clumps .",
    "both might indicate that macroscopic anisotropies and inhomogeneities were already present near the formation region of fe group elements during the very early stages of the explosion .",
    "spherically symmetric models had been suggesting for some time already that regions inside the newly formed neutron star and in the neutrino - heated layer around it might be convectively unstable .",
    "these theoretical results and the observational findings in sn  1987a were motivation to study stellar core collapse and supernova explosions with multi - dimensional simulations .    in this article",
    "convective overturn in the neutrino - heated region around the collapsed stellar core is discussed concerning its effects on the neutrino energy deposition and its potential importance for the revival of the stalled bounce shock and thus for triggering the supernova explosion .",
    "convective activity inside the proto - neutron star is suggested as a possibly crucial boost of the neutrino luminosities on a timescale of a few hundred milliseconds after core bounce .",
    "the first two - dimensional simulations that follow the evolution of the nascent neutron star for more than one second are shortly described .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] displays a sketch of the neutrino cooling and heating regions outside the proto - neutron star at the center .",
    "the main processes of neutrino energy deposition are the charged - current reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( bethe & wilson 1985 ) .",

    "@xmath14 is the angular dilution factor of the neutrino radiation field ( the `` flux factor '' , which is equal to the mean value of the cosine of the angle of neutrino propagation relative to the radial direction ) which varies between about 0.25 at the neutrinosphere and 1 for radially streaming neutrinos far out . using this energy deposition rate , neglecting loss due to re - emission of neutrinos , and assuming that the gravitational binding energy of a nucleon in the neutron star potential is ( roughly ) balanced by the sum of internal and nuclear recombination energies after accretion of the infalling matter through the shock",

    "convective instabilities in the layers adjacent to the nascent neutron star are a natural consequence of the negative entropy gradient built up by neutrino heating ( bethe 1990 ) and are seen in recent two- and three - dimensional simulations ( burrows et al .",

    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the entropy distribution between proto - neutron star and supernova shock about 170  ms after core bounce for one of the calculations by janka & mller ( 1996 ) .",
    "although there is general agreement about the existence of this unstable region between the radius of maximum neutrino heating ( which is very close outside the `` gain radius '' @xmath24 , i.e.  the radius where neutrino cooling switches into net heating ) and the shock position @xmath25 , the strength of the convective overturn and its importance for the success of the neutrino - heating mechanism in driving the explosion of the star is still a matter of vivid debate .",
    "the effect of convective overturn in the neutrino - heated region on the shock is two - fold . on the one hand ,",
    "heated matter from the region close to the gain radius rises outward and at the same time is replaced by cool gas flowing down from the postshock region . since the production reactions of neutrinos ( @xmath26 capture on nucleons and thermal processes ) are very temperature sensitive , the expansion and cooling of rising plasma reduces the energy loss by reemission of neutrinos .",
    "moreover , the net energy deposition by neutrinos is enhanced as more cool material is exposed to the large neutrino fluxes just outside the gain radius where the neutrino heating rate peaks ( the radial dilution of the fluxes roughly goes as @xmath27 ) .",
    "on the other hand , hot matter floats into the postshock region and increases the pressure there .",
    "thus the shock is pushed further out which leads to a growth of the gain region and therefore also of the net energy transfer from neutrinos to the stellar gas .      in order to get explosions by the delayed neutrino - heating mechanism ,",
    "certain conditions need to be fulfilled .",
    "expansion of the postshock region requires sufficiently large pressure gradients near the radius @xmath28 of the developing mass cut .",
    "if one neglects self - gravity of the gas in this region and assumes the density profile to be a power law , @xmath29 ( which is well justified according to numerical simulations which yield a power law index of @xmath30 ; see also bethe 1993 ) , one gets @xmath31 for the pressure in an atmosphere near hydrostatic equilibrium , and outward acceleration is maintained as long as the following condition for the `` critical '' internal energy density @xmath32 holds : @xmath33 where use was made of the relation @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical value was obtained for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "one obtains @xmath53 , which gives an estimate of the entropy in the heating region when the star is going to explode .",
    "these requirements can be coupled to the neutrino emission of the proto - neutron star by the following considerations .",
    "a stalled shock is converted into a moving one only when the neutrino heating is strong enough to increase the pressure behind the shock by a sufficient amount .",
    "considering the rankine - hugoniot relations at the shock , bruenn ( 1993 ) derived a criterion for the heating rate per unit mass , @xmath54 , behind the shock that guarantees a positive postshock velocity ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the ratio of postshock to preshock density , @xmath58 , @xmath59 the adiabatic index of the gas ( assumed to be the same in front and behind the shock ) , and @xmath60 defines the fraction of the shock radius @xmath25 where net heating by neutrino processes occurs : @xmath61 .",

    "is underlined by fig .",

    "the supporting effects of convective overturn between the gain radius and the shock described in sect .",
    "[ sec-2.2 ] lead to explosions even below the threshold luminosities for the spherically symmetric case , to higher values of the explosion energy for the same neutrino luminosities , and to a faster development of the explosion .",
    "this can clearly be seen by comparing the solid ( 2d ) and dashed ( 1d ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] also show that the explosion energy is extremely sensitive to the neutrino luminosities and mean energies .",
    "this holds in 1d as well as in 2d .",
    "the question can be asked why neutrino - driven explosions should be self - regulated .",
    "which kind of feedback should prevent the explosion from being more energetic than a few times @xmath77erg ?",
    "certainly , the neutrino luminosities in current models can hardly power an explosion and therefore a way to overpower it is not easy to imagine .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq-2 ] ) offer an answer to the question : when the matter in the neutrino - heated region outside the gain radius has absorbed roughly its gravitational binding energy from the neutrino fluxes , it starts to expand outward ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq-3 ] ) ) and moves away from the region of strongest heating .",
    "since the onset of the explosion shuts off the re - supply of the heating region with cool gas , the curves in fig .  [ fig-3 ] approach a saturation level as soon as the expansion gains momentum and the density in the heating region decreases .",
    "thus the explosion energy depends on the strength of the neutrino heating , which scales with the @xmath7 and @xmath8 luminosities and mean energies , and it is limited by the amount of matter @xmath16 in the heating region and by the duration of the heating ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq-2 ] ) ) , both of which decrease when the heating is strong and expansion happens fast .",
    "this also implies that neutrino - driven explosions can be `` delayed '' ( up to a few 100  ms after core bounce ) but are _ not _ `` late '' ( after a few seconds ) explosions .",
    "the density between the gain radius and the shock decreases with time because the proto - neutron star contracts and the mass infall onto the collapsed core declines steeply with time .",
    "therefore the mass @xmath16 in the heated region drops rapidly and energetic explosions by the neutrino - heating mechanism become less favored at late times .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] tells us that convection is _ not necessary _ to get an explosion and convective overturn is _ no guarantee _ for strong explosions .",
    "therefore one must suspect that neutrino - driven type - ii explosions should reveal a considerable spread of the explosion energies , even for similar progenitor stars .",
    "rotation in the stellar core , small differences of the core mass or statistical variations in the dynamical events that precede and accompany the explosion may lead to some variability .",
    "the potential sensitivity to the properties and structure of the progenitor star , to the dynamical events during and after core collapse , and to the neutrino emission parameters of the proto - neutron star do not make type - ii supernovae promising candidates for standard candles with a rather well defined value of the explosion energy .      the role of convective overturn and its importance for the explosion can be further illuminated by considering the three timescales of neutrino heating , @xmath78 , advection of accreted matter through the gain radius into the cooling region and onto the neutron star ( compare fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) , @xmath79 , and growth of convective instabilities , @xmath80 .",
    "the evolution of the shock  accretion or explosion  is determined by the relative sizes of these three timescales .",
    "straightforward considerations show that they are of the same order and the destiny of the star is therefore a result of a tight competition between the different processes ( see fig .  [ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "the heating timescale is estimated from the initial entropy @xmath81 , the critical entropy @xmath82 ( eq .  ( [ eq-4 ] ) ) , and the heating rate per nucleon ( eq .  ( [ eq-1 ] ) ) as @xmath83 with a postshock velocity of @xmath84 the advection timescale is @xmath85 where the gain radius can be determined as @xmath86 from the requirement that the heating rate , eq .",

    "the growth timescale of convective instabilities in the neutrino - heated region depends on the gradients of entropy and lepton number through the growth rate of ledoux convection , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 is the gravitational acceleration ) : @xmath92 the numerical value is representative for those obtained in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , janka & mller 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath80 of eq .",
    "( [ eq-10 ] ) is sensitive to the detailed conditions between neutrinosphere ( where @xmath45 has typically a minimum ) , gain radius ( where @xmath37 develops a maximum ) , and the shock .",
    "the neutrino heating timescale is shorter for larger values of the neutrino luminosity @xmath93 and mean squared neutrino energy @xmath94 , while both @xmath78 and @xmath79 depend strongly on the gain radius , @xmath79 also on the shock position .    in order to be a crucial help for the explosion , convective overturn in the neutrino - heated region",
    "must start on a sufficiently short timescale .",
    "this happens only in a rather narrow window of @xmath22 where @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for smaller neutrino luminosities",
    "the heating is too weak to create a sufficiently large entropy maximum and the convective instability can not develop before the accreted gas is advected through the gain radius ( @xmath96 ) . in this case neither with nor without convective processes energetic explosions can occur ( see also sect .  [ sec-2.3 ] ) . for larger neutrino luminosities",
    "the neutrino heating is so strong ( @xmath97 ) that expansion of the postshock layers has set in before the convective activity reaches a significant level .",
    "convective energy transport inside the newly formed neutron star can increase the neutrino luminosities considerably ( burrows 1987 ) .",

    "the coherence lengths of convective structures are of the order of 2040 degrees ( in 2d ! ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] ) and coherence times are of the order of 10  ms which corresponds to only one or two overturns .",
    "the convective pattern is therefore very time - dependent and nonstationary .",
    "convective motions lead to considerable variations of the composition .",
    "the lepton fraction ( and thus the abundance of protons ) shows relative fluctuations of several 10% .",
    "the entropy differences in rising and sinking convective bubbles are much smaller , only a few per cent , while temperature and density fluctuations are typically less than one per cent .",
    "the energy transport in the neutron star is dominated by neutrino diffusion near the center , whereas convective transport plays the major role in a thick intermediate layer where the convective activity is strongest , and radiative transport takes over again when the neutrino mean free path becomes large near the surface of the star ( fig .",
    "[ fig-8 ] ) .",
    "but even in the convective layer the convective energy flux is only a few times larger than the diffusive flux .",
    "this means that neutrino diffusion can never be neglected .",
    "there is an important consequence of this latter statement .",
    "the convective activity in the neutron star can not be described and explained as ledoux convection .",

    "in fact , below a critical value of the lepton fraction ( e.g. , @xmath114 for @xmath115g/@xmath102 and @xmath116mev ) the thermodynamical derivative @xmath117 changes sign and becomes positive because of nuclear and coulomb forces in the high - density equation of state ( see bruenn & dineva 1996 ) .",
    "therefore negative lepton number gradients should stabilize against convection in this regime .",
    "however , an idealized assumption of ledoux convection is not fulfilled in the situations considered here : because of neutrino diffusion , energy exchange and , in particular , lepton number exchange between convective elements and their surroundings are _ not _ negligible .",
    "taking the neutrino transport effects on @xmath109 into account in a modified `` _ quasi - ledoux criterion _ '' , @xmath118 ( keil 1997 and keil et al .  1997 ) , one determines instability exactly where the two - dimensional simulation reveals convective activity . in eq .",

    "accretion leads to stronger convection with larger velocities in a more extended region .",
    "this can be explained by the steepening of lepton number and entropy gradients and the increase of the gravitational potential energy when additional matter is added onto the neutron star .",
    "rotation has very interesting consequences , e.g. , leads to a suppression of convective motions near the rotation axis because of a stabilizing stratification of the specific angular momentum ( see fig .

    "this helps to increase the electron fraction @xmath45 in the neutrino - heated ejecta and might solve the overproduction problem of @xmath141 nuclei during the early epochs of the explosion ( keil et al .",
    "1996 ) . in case of rotation ,",

    "however , the global anisotropy of the neutrino emission from the cooling proto - neutron star is certainly less than 1% ( more likely only 0.1% , since in 3d the structures tend to be smaller ) and kick velocities in excess of 300  km / s can definitely not be explained .",
    "neutrino - driven explosions are very sensitive to the structure of the progenitor star , to the details of the post - bounce dynamics , and to the properties of the neutrino emission from the nascent neutron star .",
    "therefore type - ii supernova explosions do not offer promising perspectives as standard candles .",
    "convective overturn in the neutrino - heated region between gain radius and supernova shock can be an important help for the explosion only if the growth timescale of the instability is shorter than the timescale for advecting accreted material through the postshock region onto the proto - neutron star .",
    "this requires a sufficiently negative entropy gradient outside the gain radius and thus strong enough neutrino energy deposition . for low neutrino luminosities",
    "this is not the case and the star does not explode . for very large neutrino luminosities",
    "the heating is so fast that the postshock layers expand and an explosion develops before convective instabilities have significantly grown .",
    "therefore neutrino - driven convection is crucial for the explosion if one - dimensional models fail marginally , but can not guarantee `` robust '' explosions independent of the size of the neutrino luminosities from the proto - neutron star .",
    "neutrino - driven explosions are self - regulated in the sense that the explosion energy is limited by the amount of material in the neutrino - heated region and the duration of the heating .",
    "the explosion energy is of the order of ( or less than ) the binding energy of the postshock layers in the gravitational potential of the proto - neutron star , because the density and thus the heated mass around the gain radius decrease drastically as soon as the explosion gains momentum and the postshock gas expands away from the neutrinosphere .",
    "convection inside the nascent neutron star can raise the neutrino luminosities and the mean spectral energies of the emitted neutrinos considerably and thus can be a decisive boost for the neutrino heating .",
    "in addition , proto - neutron star convection has several advantageous properties .",
    "the first two - dimensional simulations show that , on the one hand , the neutrino transport out of the interior of the star is significantly increased only after convective activity has developed in a larger part of the neutron star . in",
    "the considered collapsed core of a @xmath68 star this requires a period of about 100@xmath142ms after bounce . on the other hand , since the deleptonization of the neutron star is accelerated ,",
    "the electron neutrino luminosity increases relative to the antineutrino luminosity roughly between 200 and @xmath143ms after bounce .",
    "both these findings may provide a remedy for the problems of current supernova models , namely to develop explosions too quickly and thus to yield rather small neutron stars and to dramatically overproduce nuclei around @xmath144 in the ejecta ( herant et al .",
    "1994 , burrows et al .",
    "1995 , janka & mller 1996 ) .",
    "a delay of the explosion might , however , also be obtained when the restriction to two dimensions is dropped and the convective overturn turns out to be less strong in three dimensions .",
    "the simulations performed so far can certainly not be considered as the final step . besides the need to demonstrate the existence of convective regions in the collapsed cores of different progenitor stars",
    ", future simulations will have to clarify the influence of the nuclear equation of state on the presence of convection in nascent neutron stars .",
    "also , a more accurate treatment of the neutrino transport in combination with a state - of - the - art description of the neutrino opacities of the nuclear medium is needed to confirm the existence of a convective episode during neutron star formation and to investigate its importance for the explosion mechanism of type - ii supernovae .",
    "three - dimensional simulations will finally be required to study the influence of the direction of the turbulent cascade ( from smaller to larger structures in 2d while it is opposite in 3d ) and to settle the question of hot - bubble and proto - neutron star convection quantitatively .",

    "<S> the observation of neutrinos from supernova  1987a has confirmed the theoretical conjecture that these particles play a crucial role during the collapse of the core of a massive star . </S>",
    "<S> only one per cent of the energy they carry away from the newly formed neutron star may account for all the kinetic and electromagnetic energy responsible for the spectacular display of the supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the neutrinos emitted from the collapsed stellar core at the center of the explosion couple so weakly to the surrounding matter that convective processes behind the supernova shock and/or inside the nascent neutron star might be required to increase the efficiency of the energy transfer to the stellar mantle and envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for a successful explosion by the neutrino - heating mechanism and the possible importance of convection in and around the neutron star are shortly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino - driven explosions turn out to be very sensitive to the parameters describing the neutrino emission of the proto - neutron star and to the details of the dynamical processes in the collapsed stellar core . </S>",
    "<S> therefore uniform explosions with a well defined energy seem unlikely and type - ii supernova explosions do not offer promising perspectives for being useful as standard candles . </S>"
