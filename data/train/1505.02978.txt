    "the curve diffusion flow is a particular evolution law governing the changing shape of a curve in time .",
    "it is the one - intrinsic - dimension analogue of the surface diffusion flow for evolving surfaces .",
    "these flows are gradient flows of a certain energy functional in a certain function space , but not the more common @xmath0-gradient flow such as the curve shortening flow ( corresponding to decreasing the length functional for a curve ) , the mean curvature flow ( decreasing the area functional for a surface ) , or the willmore flow ( decreasing the elastic energy for a curve or the willmore energy for a surface ) .",
    "surface diffusion flow was first described by w. w. mullins in 1956 as a model for the development of grooving at grain boundaries of heated crystal structures @xcite .",
    "the flow is also related to the cahn - hilliard equation , which describes phase separation and coarsening in the quenching process of binary alloys @xcite . for further analysis and historical remarks on the surface diffusion flow and its constrained variations",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "the surface diffusion flow is a fourth - order nonlinear parabolic system of equations that , at each time @xmath1 , moves points @xmath2 on the solution surface @xmath3 perpendicularly to the surface with speed @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the laplace - beltrami operator and @xmath6 is the mean curvature , which is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the inner product @xmath8 is the standard dot product in @xmath9 .",
    "surface diffusion flow is the geometric analogue of the classical parabolic clamped plate equation , which expresses the dynamics of a flat plate realised as the graph of a function over a domain in @xmath10 .",
    "the curve diffusion flow is similarly the geometric analogue of the classical parabolic euler - bernoulli model for a clamped rod , modelled as the graph of a function over an interval in @xmath11 .",
    "when the domain is no longer flat , as is the case for a clamped arc segment of a circle in the plane or cylindrical ring in space , the geometry of the problem must enter into the model @xcite .",
    "the surface or curve diffusion flow can capture the notion of stability for an elastic plate or rod under stress respectively .",
    "indeed , if the flow returns all small perturbations of a given initial configuration to that initial configuration without exception , then this configuration is called stable @xcite .",
    "if the evolving surfaces are cylindrical , as would be the case for idealised closed ribbons with their width extended to infinity , then this remains so under the flow . in this case",
    "the flow equation reduces to a one - dimensional parabolic equation for the profile curve @xmath12 . for the surface diffusion flow ,",
    "this equation is exactly the curve diffusion flow .",
    "this reduction is also performed in @xcite .     where @xmath13 .",
    "the curve @xmath14 is called the profile curve .",
    "the ribbon on the left is embedded , while the ribbon on the right is immersed .",
    "the profile curve of the ribbon on the right is the self - similar figure eight curve we introduce in section 6.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   where @xmath13 .",
    "the curve @xmath14 is called the profile curve .",
    "the ribbon on the left is embedded , while the ribbon on the right is immersed .",
    "the profile curve of the ribbon on the right is the self - similar figure eight curve we introduce in section 6.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    let us briefly remark on the above procedure with respect to the particular case of a mbius band .",
    "extending the width of the mbius band to infinity must result in self - intersections , and so , the profile curve does not project uniquely to a plane curve in @xmath10 .",
    "this is an essential characteristic of the mbius band .",
    "one way in which we could overcome this difficulty is instead to immerse the mbous band in @xmath15 , then extend the width to infinity , and project to @xmath9 .",
    "this would produce a profile curve in @xmath9 , the analysis of the dynamics of which are much more complicated than for the planar curve case .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the dynamics of solutions to the curve diffusion flow which evolve either by scaling , translation or rotation only .",
    "these solutions are known as _",
    "solitons_. solitons are of interest both from a theoretical and practical viewpoint due to their relationship with singularities : given a family of evolving curves , if the family exists for at most a finite amount of time , then it must develop a singularity at the final time . upon rescaling the flow , effectively ` zooming in on the singularity ' , we expect to construct a family of curves which approximate one of the solitons for the flow .",
    "the existence of finite - time singularities is typically a difficult question , especially in the case of fourth and higher - order curvature flows . for the curve diffusion flow , this",
    "was settled in polden @xcite .",
    "the analysis there was later extended by escher and ito @xcite to more complex initial configurations .",
    "in particular , they prove the following theorem .",
    "[ tt ] let @xmath16 be a plane curve with winding number zero .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the maximal time of existence for the curve diffusion flow @xmath18 with initial data @xmath19",
    ". then    1 .",
    "the estimate @xmath20 holds , where @xmath21 denotes the length of @xmath16 ; and 2 .",
    "if @xmath22 then the solution shrinks to a point as @xmath1 approaches @xmath17 .",
    "this theorem raises two interesting questions :    1 .",
    "is there a solution with winding number zero whose maximal existence time satisfies @xmath23 ?",
    "2 .   is there a solution with winding number zero that shrinks to a point ? ( that is , no other kind of singularity occurs . )",
    "the first question investigates the sharpness of the theorem .",
    "its answer is no , since in the proof of theorem [ tt ] , fenchel s inequality is used , and for plane curves with winding number zero , it is strict .",
    "furthermore , the upper bound from theorem 1 may be improved by a factor of @xmath24 by using the following argument .",
    "let @xmath25 be a family of curves evolving by curve diffusion flow .",
    "differentiating the length yields @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the curvature of @xmath25 and @xmath28 is parametrised by arc length .",
    "we use @xmath29 and @xmath30 to denote the arc length derivative and element respectively .",
    "( we refer the reader to section 2 for more detail on the notation . ) for curves with winding number zero , the curvature @xmath31 has zero average , and furthermore @xmath32 ( this holds for any function with zero average ) , so , using the standard sharp poincar inequality we compute @xmath33 in the above we have omitted the argument @xmath25 from @xmath34 . since @xmath35 ( by a simple variant of fenchel s theorem ) , we combine this with above to conclude @xmath36 and consequently we obtain the estimate @xmath37 , which is better than the estimate given by theorem 1 .    in the above proof , there are three key estimates used : fenchel s inequality , the poincar inequality , and a sharp hlder - type inequality for functions with zero average .",
    "it is not the case that the same curve satisfies equality for all three of these and therefore it appears clear that the improved bound @xmath38 is again not optimal .",
    "the broader question therefore on characterising the optimal upper bound on the maximal time of existence in terms of initial length for curves with winding number zero remains open :    1 .",
    "is there a @xmath39 depending only on initial length @xmath21 such that : 1 .",
    "all curve diffusion flows with winding number zero have maximal time bounded by @xmath39 ; and 2 .",
    "does there exist at least one curve diffusion flow with maximal time equal to @xmath39 , or , does there exist a sequence of solutions @xmath40 with initial data @xmath41 and winding number zero whose maximal existence time @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 ?    in this paper we shall not answer this question .",
    "we do however provide an answer to the second question ( 2 ) above .",
    "the second question is interesting from a classification of finite - time singularities perspective .",
    "the key issue there is to demonstrate that solutions may become singular by simply becoming small  a rescaling of such solutions will exist for all time and be asymptotic to a smooth model curve .",
    "a finite - time singularitiy of this type is said to be of type i , in analogy with existing work on the mean curvature flow @xcite .",
    "other singularities are called type ii .",
    "type i singularities are expected to be simpler in structure and satisfy natural stability criteria when compared with type ii singularities .",
    "we answer the second question in the affirmative by way of an explicit example : a self - similarly shrinking immersed figure eight .",
    "this figure eight is in fact the lemniscate of bernoulli .",
    "since one requires zero area to have the possibility that the solution shrinks to a point ( see lemma [ t : marea ] ) , and the maximal existence time is finite ( see theorem 1 ) , a figure eight with one leaf smaller than the other will certainly become singular with non - zero area , ruling out the possibility that it is asymptotic to a point .",
    "let @xmath12 be the shrinking figure eight described in section 6 . upon scaling @xmath12 to satisfy @xmath44 , we compute the extinction time of the flow to be @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with parameter @xmath47 . in this particular case",
    "the maximal time estimate @xmath48 overshoots @xmath17 by a factor of roughly 2.9 , and @xmath49 overshoots @xmath17 by a factor of roughly 2.4 : @xmath50 in a sense , the self - similar figure eight represents a `` best - case '' scenario .",
    "the generic case is that an arbitrary smooth curve with winding number zero will be driven to a curvature singularity and not shrink to a point .",
    "furthermore , such a singularity involves blowup of the curvature and its derivatives , so in particular the speed of the flow is greater in this circumstance .",
    "these heuristics lead us to make the following conjecture .",
    "the maximal existence time of a curve diffusion flow emanating from a curve with winding number zero is bounded by the existence time of a self - similar figure eight with the same initial length .    of course , verifying the conjecture has uniqueness of the self - similar figure eight as a corollary .",
    "another popular fourth - order surface evolution equation is the willmore flow , whose one - dimensional counterpart , the elastic flow , also models cylindrical elastic ribbons .",
    "the key difference between the two flows is that the elastic flow minimises the integral of the square of the curvature of the curve , while the curve diffusion flow minimises length , keeps enclosed volume fixed , and keeps the quantity @xmath51 uniformly bounded , with a bound dependent only on the initial data .",
    "a proof of these statements can be found in @xcite .",
    "we remark on the similarities and differences between this flow and the curve diffusion flow throughout this article .",
    "the structure and specific contributions of this article are as follows .",
    "we begin section 2 by setting up notation , defining key geometric quantities and giving the fourth - order nonlinear parabolic system of partial differential equations for the curve diffusion flow .",
    "we then briefly review relevant previous work and the question of local existence before moving on to a classification of stationary solutions  those that remain constant under the flow .",
    "we provide a five - parameter family of parametrisations which completely classifies these solutions . in section 3",
    "we record some elementary properties of the flow that are relevant to our investigations . in section 4",
    "we focus on curves that evolve self - similarly , deriving the corresponding fourth - order ordinary differential equation satisfied by such curves .",
    "we prove several properties of self - similar solutions .",
    "section 5 is devoted to curves that evolve by translation only .",
    "we prove there that the only closed translators are circles , and that the only open translators ( open immersions of @xmath11 ) satisfying either of two conditions at infinity are straight lines . in section 6 we provide an explicit parametrisation of a figure eight immersed curve and verify that this curve does indeed evolve self - similarly under the curve diffusion flow , contracting to a point in finite time . in section 7 we consider the case of rotating solutions and prove some non - existence results analogous to those for translators in section 5 .",

    "we will parametrise closed evolving curves over the unit circle @xmath52 , and open evolving curves over the real line @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the evolving curve , with components @xmath53 the tangent direction to the curve is given by @xmath54 and therefore a choice of unit normal is @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the length of a vector .",
    "we will always assume our curves are smooth and regular , that is , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "recall that , in a general parametrisation , the arc length of a curve @xmath12 , beginning at point @xmath59 , is given by @xmath60 the arc length induces an arc length element @xmath61 . the curvature vector and curvature of a plane curve",
    "is given by @xmath62 where we use @xmath8 to denote the standard inner product between vectors in the plane .",
    "for closed embedded curves , we will always choose an inward - pointing unit normal , so that the curvature of a circle is positive . otherwise , we select either normal  the curve diffusion flow is invariant under changes in orientation .",
    "we say @xmath63 evolves under the curve diffusion flow if it satisfies the system of fourth - order partial differential equations @xmath64 with initial condition @xmath65 for some given initial curve immersion @xmath12 .",
    "note that an immersed curve may have intersections , however , it has a well - defined tangent vector for each @xmath58 .",
    "we label the maximal existence time of a solution to as @xmath17 .",
    "we are interested in the shape of the evolving curves , that is , the image @xmath66 for closed solutions , or @xmath67 for open solutions , as a set in @xmath10 , and not in the orbit of a specific point .",
    "there is a degeneracy in the flow equation : reparametrisation and tangential movement of points in the direction of @xmath68 do not affect the shape of the image @xmath66 .",
    "the degeneracy consists of every diffeomorphism @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that , in terms of the images @xmath66 , the flow is equivalent to @xmath70 the impact of this observation on our analysis here is that when considering solutions with a particular form , we must also take into account a possible diffeomorphism @xmath71 acting on @xmath52 .",
    "this typically forces us to take normal projections in order to remove the influence of @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 so",
    "that the leading order term of @xmath73 is precisely @xmath74 the normal direction is ` positive ' for the flow , and so this shows that is a quasilinear parabolic system for a function @xmath75 . ] .",
    "current understanding of the curve diffusion flow is quite limited , apart from short time existence .",
    "there are several methods for obtaining short time existence of solutions to given suitable initial data ; we refer the reader to the discussion of these in @xcite and the references contained therein .",
    "very little else is known about the behaviour of the flow .",
    "giga and ito @xcite provided an example of a simple , closed , embedded plane curve that develops a self - intersection in finite time under the flow .",
    "they also gave an example in @xcite of a closed , strictly convex plane curve that becomes non - convex in finite time .",
    "elliot and maier - paape showed that curves that are initially graphical may evolve under to become non - graphical in finite time @xcite . on the other hand , the fourth author recently showed @xcite that under the curve diffusion flow , solution curves that are initially close to a circle , in the sense of the normalised integral of the square of the oscillation of curvature , exist for all time and converge exponentially fast to a ( possibly different ) circle .",
    "further , those admissible curves which are initially embedded remain embedded .",
    "a fundamental obstacle in the analysis of such flows and of is that , as a system of higher order partial differential equations , arguments based upon maximum principles are in general not available .",
    "let us now move on to the classification of stationary curve diffusion flows .",
    "we call the family of curves @xmath76 a _ closed _ solution if @xmath12 satisfies and @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",
    "the smallest such @xmath79 is the period of @xmath12 .",
    "a solution is called _ stationary _ if it does not change in time under , that is , if @xmath80 .",

    "then @xmath12 is a round circle .",
    "* proof : * integrating by parts and using @xmath82 we have @xmath83 and so @xmath84 , that is , @xmath31 is constant .",
    "therefore @xmath12 is a smooth closed curve with constant curvature , and by the classification of curves in @xmath10 , any curve with constant curvature in the plane is a straight line or round circle .",
    "since @xmath12 is closed , @xmath12 can not be a straight line , and so it must be a round circle . @xmath85",
    "the situation is more complicated for open solutions .",
    "we define an _ open curve _ to be a regular immersion @xmath86 of @xmath11 for which there does not exist a pair of intervals @xmath87 , @xmath88 such that @xmath89 this last condition captures the notion of not allowing @xmath12 to ` close ' while still allowing infinitely many self - intersections , including possibly intersecting on an arbitrarily large open set .",
    "open curves may concentrate around a particular point , such as a logarithmic spiral .",
