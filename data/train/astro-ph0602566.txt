    "the observed properties of the x - ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies present several challenging puzzles for which satisfactory explanations are yet to be found .",
    "the absence of cold gas ( with temperatures below @xmath0 kev ) is one of those puzzles ( e.g. peterson _ et .",
    "because of radiative losses , one would expect the temperature profiles to fall below a kev or so in the central regions where cooling is most efficient . yet in none of the observed clusters does the temperature drop to the level dictated by cooling alone .",
    "hence efficient heating mechanisms must operate without fail at the cores of all cooling clusters .",
    "the most popular mechanism for suppressing cooling is energy released by an agn harboured by the central cluster galaxy ( cf .",

    "relativistic ejecta from the agn transform into hot bubbles that eventually reach pressure equilibrium with the icm and proceed to rise buoyantly away from the center .",
    "these bubbles are believed to be one of the means with which the agn can heat the icm .",
    "for example , mechanical activity associated with the inflation of the bubbles near the center can generate internal gravity waves ( ie .",
    "disturbances that are subject to a restoring force of gravity or buoyancy ) ( omma _ et .",
    "2004 ) and/or sound waves which are believed to eventually dissipate their energy in the icm . to balance cooling in a cluster of x - ray luminosity of @xmath1 ,",
    "a central agn must produce @xmath2 over the entire life - time of the cluster .",
    "this is at the upper limit of the observed range of agn energy output in galaxy clusters , based on the @xmath3 content of x - ray cavities ( e.g. brzan _ et .",
    "since the @xmath3 energy content must be a lower estimate of the agn energy output ( see below ) , it is reasonable to assume that cooling is quenched by agn feedback .",
    "the challenge , however , is to arrange for efficient energy transport from the agn over the entire cooling core , or out to distances of up to @xmath4 .",
    "typically , studies investigating the impact of agns have tended to focus on agn activity in only the central galaxy , and invoke relatively high values of thermal conduction to redistribute the energy across the cooling core ( see , for example , roychowdhury _ et .",
    "2005 ) . here",
    ", we propose instead that the cluster icm is heated by the agn activity in more than just the one central galaxy .",
    "the central region of the clusters is rich in giant elliptical galaxies , most of which are presumed to harbour supermassive black holes that are thought to inject radio bubbles into the icm with a duty cycle of @xmath5 yr per hubble time ( best _ et .",
    "2006 ) .    upon injection ,",
    "the overpressurized bubbles rapidly expand ( virtually in situ ) to reach pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , generating waves and shocks , the dissipation of which is the primary mechanism by which the icm is heated . once in pressure equilibrium , the bubbles will rise buoyantly .",
    "the dissipation of the work done by viscous drag acting to retard the bubbles motion will further heat the icm , though to a much lesser extent . in response to the decreasing pressure",
    ", the rising bubbles will expand .",
    "this expansion causes a corresponding compression of the icm .",
    "however , while the initial inflation of the cavity may trigger internal gravity waves , compression waves and shocks that heat the icm , this subsequent expansion - compression is adiabatic in character and no heating of the icm ensues , even though the icm s internal energy will increase due to compression . in fact , the compression actually leads to the erosion of the thermal content of the icm because the resulting increase in density results in enhanced cooling .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the compression of the icm can be approximated as an adiabatic process so that the  entropy \" @xmath6 is conserved .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cooling time is @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , cooling becomes more efficient as @xmath8 is increased during adiabatic compression .    in our model , the heating occurs near where the bubbles are produced but since the galaxies that produce these bubbles are distributed throughout the cluster core region , so too is the heating .",
    "modest heat conduction should suffice to distribute further the energy over the icm between the galaxies .",
    "since the energy deposition is a local phenonemon , it is relatively straightforward to construct a self - regulating model .    to model the interaction of the bubbles with the icm ( which we treat as all material not belonging to the hot and dilute bubbles )",
    ", we use a spherical one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamical code .",
    "the code treats the bubbles and the icm as a two - fluid system in a fixed dark matter halo .",
    "the code treats the interaction of the bubbles and icm in a consistent semi - analytical way and assumes that the distribution of bubbles is spherically symmetric .",
    "the code integrates the hydrodynamical equations of an _ ambient medium _ with thermodynamic properties which depend on the local filling factor of bubbles .",

    "we conclude with a summary and general discussion of alternative heating schemes in  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "a 1d hydrodynamical code can not tackle the intrinsically three - dimensional ( 3d ) problem of the evolution of individual bubbles in the icm , in particular if bubbles are injected from sources away from the center as in our proposed scenario .",
    "therefore , a formalism for following the evolution of bubbles statistically must be developed .",
    "we represent bubbles as a fluid specified by the following physical quantities : the radius of bubbles , their number density , and velocity , all as a function of distance from the center . the bubbles and",

    "this is the energy available to lift the bubble against the drag force , overcome the inertia of displacing the surrounding fluid , as well as compress the ambient medium .    in general , it is not possible to determine how much of this energy that will go towards compressing the ambient medium and how much will towards heating the icm , be it due to drag or through the eventual dissipation of the wakes and motions associated with the displacement of the icm , unless one knows the details of the rise - expansion process . in the limit that the bubble rises slowly , maintaining pressure equilibrium with its surroundings at all times , the bubble expansion / icm compression is adiabatic and the change in the internal energy of the bubble goes entirely towards raising the internal energy of the ambient medium . in this case , the total energy available for heating the icm is simply that due to the change in the potential energy and the corresponding heating rate ( in units of energy per unit time ) is @xmath74 to get the heating rate per unit mass , @xmath75 , we multiply this expression by the number density of bubbles , @xmath76 , and divide it by the mass density of the ambient medium per unit volume @xmath14 ( see equation [ eq : rhoadef ] ) .",

    "secondly , the viscosity has to be finely tuned : too high a value results in dissipation much to closely concentrated near the central source , and too low a value means the heating is inefficient . since the relevant viscosity coefficient scales as @xmath163 ( spitzer 1962 ) , it is difficult to envison that a viscous solution that relies on fine - tuning prevails in all clusters .",
    "moreover , the icm is weakly magnetized , and the nature of transport processes , like thermal conduction and viscosity , in such media is not well understood .",
    "the model presented here heats the icm through shocks generated during the initial inflation of the bubbles , and drag forces acting on the rising bubbles .",
    "however , the latter relies on some viscosity to dissipate heat but it is not an important source of heating and with respect to the former , we do not need to fine - tune the viscosity since the energy distribution is effected by multiple agns hosted in a spatially extended distribution of galaxies .",
    "moreover , it may be possible to avoid the issue altogether .",
    "heinz & churazov ( 2005 ) have recently argued that in a bubble - filled medium of the kind proposed here , the bubbles themselves act as catalysts to convert shock and waves into heat .",
    "additionally , the interaction between the bubbles and the strong shocks will both broaden and distort the shock fronts , causing the features to appear weaker in x - ray observations and resulting in mistaken assumptions that cavity inflation is a gentle process and that the icm is not subject to strong shocks .",
    "both of these features further contribute to making our model highly viable .",
    "an additional principal feature of our model is the incorporation of self - regulation between heating and cooling .",
    "this should inevitably lead to a correlation between the mechanical heating luminosity and the cooling rate .",
    "the former is measured by the properties of x - ray cavities and the latter by the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "evidence for such a correlation is given by brzan _ et .",
    "al . _  ( 2004 ) .",
    "in fact , the estimated ratio of mechanical to x - ray luminosity in this latter paper falls short of that needed by croton _ et",
    ". al . _  ( 2005 ) in order to quench cooling flows on group and cluster scales by a factor of 3 - 10 ( best _ et .",
    "however , the inferred mechanical luminosities are based on cavity @xmath3 estimates . in our model ,",
    "a primary source of energy transfer to the icm is via weak shocks generated by the expansion of the initially over - pressurised bubble .",
    "the initial bubble energy is related to the cavity @xmath3 by equation ( [ eq : eb0 ] ) , and the resulting injected mechanical energy may exceed @xmath3 by a factor of up to 10 .",
    "note that this equation neglects the work done by the agn jet to place the initial seed bubble in the icm , which can be dissipative and contribute to heating the icm if the seed bubble is ejected with supersonic speeds .",
    "furthermore , these estimates neglects the energy content in waves detected in a few clusters ( fabian _ et .",
    "al . _  2003",
    "; nulsen _ et .",
    "2005 , mcnamara _ et .",
    "our model consequently helps in resolving the apparent discrepancy in the estimated feedback required to halt cooling flows even in massive clusters .",
    "an alternative heating source involves cosmic rays in the icm cooling core , injected by a central agn ( rephaeli and silk 1995 ) .",
    "the present model provides a distributed source of cosmic rays whose observable signatures could also include a sunyaev - zeldovich signal ( pfrommer & ennslin 2004 ) as well as an additional hadronic heating source ( colafrancesco , dar & de rjula 2004 ) that might lead to a detectable gamma ray flux .",
    "more exotic heating sources invoke collisions between superheavy dark matter particles and protons ( qin & wu 2001 , chuzhoy & nusser 2004 ) as well as by the products of dark matter neutralino annihilations ( colafrancesco 2004 ) .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with scott kay , garret cotter and yehuda hoffman .",
