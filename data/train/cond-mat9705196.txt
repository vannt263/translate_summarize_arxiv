    "the increasing amount of neutron data on quasi-1d antiferromagnets calls for creation of a theory capable of describing the behaviour of such strongly anisotropic nonlinear systems in greater detail . of particular interest with regard to recent experiments on @xmath2 and @xmath0",
    "is the structure of the multiparticle continua . in the present paper",
    "we discuss correlation functions of three closely related problems involving spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chains : ( i ) a single chain with a static alternating exchange , ( ii ) a single chain in a staggered magnetic field , ( iii ) a system of weakly coupled spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chains at low temperatures in the ordered phase . in the latter case",
    "we consider two types of order : ( a ) spin - peierls @xcite and ( b ) antiferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "an experimental realisation of situation ( i ) may be achieved in ( vo)@xmath4p@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of the recent experiments conducted by @xcite indicates that the strongest exchange occurs through alternatively arranged molecules of two different types such that the ratio of the exchange integrals is @xmath6 .",
    "the second situation ( ii ) may be realized when a heisenberg magnet with a staggered land factor is placed in an external magnetic field .",
    "this is the case for copper benzoate @xcite but the difference in land factors is very small and for reasons that will be discussed elsewhere the theory presented here does not apply .",
    "the spin - peierls transition is a magnetoelastic transition which occurs in quasi-1d antiferromagnets due to an effective four - spin interaction .",
    "such interactions may be generated by phonons which modify the exchange integrals ; however , the virtual absence of softening of the phonon spectrum in the spin - peierls material cugeo@xmath7 @xcite suggests that there may be also other mechanisms .",
    "the interaction between the staggered parts of energy densities is strongly relevant and resolves in dimerization of the lattice at a certain temperature t@xmath8 and the formation of spectral gaps in the spectrum of magnetic excitations . in any realistic system phonons",
    "are three - dimensional which determines a three dimensional nature of the spin - peierls transition . a simple model with a phonon mechanism has the following hamiltonian h & = & j_*r*,n(1+(-1)^nu_n,*r * ) _ n , * r*_n+1,*r * + _ n,*r**r***u_n,*r * d(*r - * r**)u_n,*r*&+&j_*r*,n_n , * r*_n+2,*r * + _ * r*,*c*,nk(*c * )  _ n , * r * _ n,*r+*c * * [ ha ]  , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 label lattice sites along and perpendicular to the chains and @xmath11 are vectors connecting neighbouring chains . in order to make contact with experiments we have included n.n.n .",
    "intrachain as well as interchain magnetic interactions .",
    "since @xmath12 is usually much smaller than the phonon frequency , one can neglect the kinetic energy of the @xmath13-field and consider @xmath13 as commuting numbers .",
    "one can denote ( n , * r * ) = ( -1)^n(_n,*r*_n + 1,*r * ) and integrate over the displacements .",
    "the result is h_sp&= & j_*r*,n_n , * r*_n+1,*r*+ _ n,*r,*r**(n , * r*)j(*r*- * r*)(n , * r*)&+&j_*r*,n_n,*r*_n+2,*r * + _ * r*,*c*,nk(*c * )  _ n , * r * _ n,*r+*c * *  , [ hsp ] where @xmath14 is proportional to the matrix inverse of @xmath15 . now one can forget about phonons and use ( [ hsp ] ) as a general model for the spin - peierls state .    in their low temperature phases",
    "both @xmath16 and the antiferromagnet discussed below have order parameters . for the spin - peierls model",
    "this is the staggered energy density @xmath17 ( for simplicity we assume that there is no antiferromagnetic order in the spin - peierls model ) .",
    "therefore in the low temperature phase it is convenient to subtract from @xmath18 its average value ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this leads to the following hamiltonian h_sp & = & _ * r*h^(0)_*r * + _ n,*r**r***:(n , * r*):j(*r*- * r*):(n , * r* ) : + _ * r*,*c*,nk(*c * )  _ n , * r * _ n,*r+*c * *  , [ h1 ] + h^(0)_*r * & = & j_n_n , * r*_n + 1 , * r * + j_n_n , * r*_n+2,*r * + 2(j_a+j_b)_0_n(n,*r * ) - n_0 ^ 2(j_a+j_b )  , [ sp ] where @xmath20 are the couplings ( generated by the coupling to the phonons ) to the neighbouring chains in @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions ( the chain direction is chosen to be @xmath23 ) . for definiteness we assume in the following that @xmath24",
    ". however , the general case can be treated by minor modifications of the formulas presented below .",
    "sometimes the purely one - dimensional model ( [ sp ] ) is used to describe the low temperature phase .",
    "we shall show below that such approximation always becomes very poor close to the spectral gap .",
    "the second model we want to discuss consists of coupled spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "their hamiltonian is h_afm = j_n,*r*(_n,*r * _ n + 1,*r * ) + j__n,*r*,*a * _ n,*r*_n,*r + a *  , [ hb ] where we take @xmath25 and * a * are lattice vectors in transverse directions . for simplicity we assume the transverse coupling to be isotropic in @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "taking the antiferromagnetic order ( which we assume to be along the @xmath28 direction ) into account by a mean - field analysis of the interchain interaction one obtains the effective single - chain problem @xcite h_0 = j_n_n_n + 1 - h_n(-1)^ns_n^z-2nj_m_0 ^ 2  , [ stchain ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining interchain interactions will be treated in rpa ( see section vi ) .",
    "we shall discuss the spin - peierls case of weak dimerization @xmath31 . in this case",
    "one can use a continuous description of the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain which , for @xmath32 @xcite , is given by the gaussian model . in the framework of this model one can express spin operators in terms of bosonic exponents ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for instance , we have ( x ) = ( ) +  .",
    "[ boson ] the value @xmath33 was found by nakano and fukuyama @xcite by using the jordan - wigner transformation with a subsequent bosonization .",
    "there is a simplier way to establish this value of @xmath34 , namely , we can use the fact that the initial hamiltonian has an su(2 ) symmetry which must be respected by the bosonized form . replacing @xmath35 in eq.([ha ] ) by the order parameter , that is treating it as a number and using eq.([boson ] ) we obtain the sine - gordon model .",
    "since the su(2 ) symmetry in the sine - gordon model is not present for general values of @xmath34 its requirement imposes a restriction on the value of @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding point in the sine - gordon spectrum was discovered by coleman @xcite and haldane @xcite who pointed out that at @xmath33 there are only two breathers ; the first one has the same mass as kink and antikink ( let us call it @xmath36 ) and the second has the mass equal to @xmath37 .",
    "therefore at @xmath33 kink , antikink and the first breather realize an su(2 ) triplet and the second breather becomes an su(2 ) singlet .    in what follows",
    "we also need the bosonized form of the spin density in the continuum ( @xmath38 ) , which is given by ( x ) & = & _ r ( x ) + _ l(x ) + ( -1)^n ( x )  , j^z_r , l&=&(_x),j^+_r , l= ( i ( ) ) , n^z ( x ) & = & - ( x ) , n^(x ) = .",

    "the field @xmath43 is the dual of the scalar field @xmath44 and obeys @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the canonical conjugate of @xmath44",
    ". we note that ( [ boso ] ) differ from the `` usual '' expressions ( see p. 270 - 271 of @xcite ) by a shift of the bosonic field by @xmath47 .",
    "this operation interchanges @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but changes neither derivatives of @xmath44 nor the dual field @xmath43 .",
    "notice that despite the fact that @xmath50 has the same dimension as the z - component of the staggered magnetization , it is given by a different operator ( sine instead of cosine ) .",
    "in fact @xmath50 is the @xmath51-component of the charge density in the system with a frozen charge field .",
    "as we shall see the situation is somewhat similar to that for the spin - ladder ( see for example @xcite ) , but there are also certain subtle differences . substituting ( [ boson ] ) into eqs.([h1 ] ) we get the following bosonized version of the spin - peierls hamiltonian @xmath52 h_*r*^(0 ) & = & x[_*r*^2 + ( _ x_*r*)^2 ] + x  ( _ * r * ) -n_0 ^ 2 ( j_a+j_b )  , [ sg ] + v_phonon & = & _ * r*,*r*x:(_*r*(x)):j(*r*- * r*):(_*r*(x)):[vphonon ] + v_spin & = & _ * r*,*c * x  k(*c * )  _ * r*(x)_*r+c*(x )  , [ vspin ] where @xmath53 .",

    "it is related to the scale @xmath58 as follows @xcite = ^ .",
    "the ground state energy density of @xmath56 is then given by @xmath59 , which in turn yields an expression for the ground state energy density of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath61 .",
