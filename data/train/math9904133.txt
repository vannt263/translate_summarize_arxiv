    "hence @xmath348 which contradicts with ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma [ 29 ] .",
    "consider a function @xmath237 which is discontinious at the point @xmath31 .",

    "one may check in each case that due to the property ( ii ) and lemma [ 29 ] the paths corresponding to functions @xmath24 and @xmath268 for large @xmath97 separate exactly at the point @xmath351 , and that the angle @xmath352,[x_i^s , x_i^g)$ ] is separated from zero . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath268 is continuous at @xmath31 then @xmath24 has a discontinuity of the first type ( see figure 1 , left ) ; the angles marked with black are close to zero by lemma [ 29 ] , the angle @xmath179 by property ( ii ) is neither @xmath21 nor @xmath353 and does not depend on @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath268 is discontinuous at @xmath31 ( see figure 1 , right ) then similarly the angles marked with black are close to zero by lemma [ 29 ] and the angle @xmath354 by property ( ii ) is neither @xmath21 nor @xmath353 and does not depend on @xmath97 .",
