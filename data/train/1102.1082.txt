    "the lower the mass , the higher the mean density , i.e. the larger the and . * in addition * , according to imf , the lower the stellar mass , the more the number of stars .",
    "thus there is a peak at ` high ' frequencies . in our models ,",
    "the hf peak is caused by the stars with @xmath26 0.8 , which is the lower limit of * the * initial mass of the primary * star * in a primordial binary system . because the mean density , i.e. the , of a ms star decreases with age , the location of * the * hf peak moves to a lower frequency with increasing age .",
    "the hf and rc peaks exist in clusters with different ages .",
    "however , the ms peak * barely appears * in young clusters with age @xmath0 1 gyr ; and it disperses gradually with increasing age .    * a * rc peak had been observed by _",
    "corot _ @xcite . when age @xmath2 2.0 gyr , the dominant rc peak is located * approximately * between 2.5 and 4 @xmath27hz , which is not sensitive to age . however , when age @xmath1 2 gyr , the location of the dominant rc peak is sensitive to age .",
    "for example , the dominant peak is located at about 3.5 - 4.5 @xmath27hz for the cluster with age = 0.5 gyr , whereas it is located at about 6 - 7 @xmath27hz for the cluster with age = 1.0 gyr .",
    "moreover , our calculations show that the dominant rc peak of * the * cluster with age @xmath25 1.2 gyr is located at * approximately * 7 - 8 , which is higher than the values of other clusters .",
    "the rc peak is caused by * the fact * that the radius of many rc stars near the zahb concentrates in a certain range . for example , the mass of rc stars of the simulated cluster with z = 0.02 and age = 1.0 gyr is almost uniformly distributed in the range 2.13 - 2.28 .",

    "when they reach the ` zahb ' , their mean densities decrease with increasing mass , just * like * zams .",
    "however , for stars with @xmath29 2.0 , electrons in the hydrogen - exhausted core are highly degenerate before helium ignition occurs .",
    "the radius of these stars on the zahb depends mainly on the mass of the hydrogen - exhausted core at the time of helium ignition and on the mass * of * the overlying envelope .",
    "the mean density of these stars on the zahb does not * depend simply * on the total mass , but it is usually less than * the mean density * of stars with @xmath30 2.0 .",
    "thus * a * zahb star with @xmath30 2.0 has the highest mean density .",
    "furthermore , for stars with @xmath23 2.0 the temperature and density distributions in the core are * almost * unique functions of the core mass @xcite . for stars with @xmath31 1.6 ,",
    "when they reach the zahb , * their radius and the mass of their envelopes * decrease with the decrease in the total mass , but the core mass is approximately equal .",
    "their mean densities are approximately equal too , which leads to a similar value of for these stars on the zahb . the mass of many zahb stars in * the * cluster with z = 0.02 and age @xmath25 1.2 gyr is about 2.0 , hence the frequency of the dominant rc peak of this cluster is larger than that of other clusters .",
    "the mass of rc stars * in * clusters with z = 0.02 and age @xmath2 2.4 gyr is less than 1.6 , so that the locations of the dominant rc * peaks * of these clusters are almost same . the asteroseismical observation for red giant stars of clusters with age @xmath0 2.4 gyr may provide a help to test the theory of the degeneracy of hydrogen - exhausted core .",
    "differing from the ms peak that * exists only * in young clusters , the rc peak * exists in almost * all clusters .",
    "this is because the rc stars near the zahb exist in clusters with different ages in our simulations .",
    "the histograms of * the * radius and mass of clusters with age = 0.5 and 5.0 gyr are shown in fig .",
    "[ figmr ] .",
    "the * distributions of the * mass * have * only one peak , at about 0.8 , which is caused by imf . however , the distributions of the radius are similar to those of and",
    ". there are three peaks in * radius distribution * of * the * cluster with age = 0.5 gyr .",
    "the ` low - radius ' peak * corresponds * to the hf peak of , the ` middle - radius ' peak * to * the ms peak of , and the ` high - radius ' peak * to * the rc peak of .",
    "however , when age = 5 gyr , there is no ` middle - radius ' peak in the distribution of * the * radius and also no ms peak in the distribution of .",
    "this clearly shows that the ms peak is caused by * the fact that * many young ms stars * have approximately the same radii * , and the distribution of is more sensitive to the distribution of * the * radius than to that of * the * mass",

    "[ figmr ] shows that both the ` low - mass ' peak and ` low - radius ' peak are significant for the cluster with z = 0.02 and age = 0.5 gyr .",
    "they * correspond * to the hf peaks",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the ms peaks of and * are * more significant than the hf peaks .",
    "this is because the of ` low - mass ' stars decreases more quickly with increasing mass than that of ` middle - mass ' stars in the cluster .",
    "for example , when the mass of a star with z = 0.02 increases from 0.8 to 0.9 , its radius increases from * approximately * 0.727 to 0.806 @xmath28 at 0.5 gyr , which leads to a decrease of about 17.5 in * the * of * that * star .",
    "however , when the mass of a star increases from 1.55 to 1.65 , its radius increases from 1.566 to 1.644 @xmath28 , which results in a decrease of about * only * 3.5 in * the * of * that * star .",
    "thus , although the number of stars with mass between 0.8 and 0.9 is about twice as much as that of stars with mass between 1.55 and 1.65 , the interval of of the former is 5 times as wide as that of the latter",
    ". therefore the ms peaks are more significant than the hf peaks .    using eggleton s stellar evolution code , we calculated the evolutions of stars with z = 0.02 and mass between 1.55 and 1.65 .",
    "our calculations show that these stars have an approximate radius between 1.465 and 1.492 @xmath32 at the age of about 40 myr , which leads to almost * the * same mean density , i.e. almost * the * same .",
    "however , the mean density of a ms star decreases with age .",
    "since a high mass star evolves faster than a lower mass star , the mean density of * a * star with @xmath33 = 1.65 decreases faster than that of * a * star with @xmath33 = 1.55 .",
    "thus the of stars with mass between 1.55 and 1.65 disperses gradually with increasing age .",
    "for example , the difference * in * between these two models is about 3.5 at the age of 0.5 gyr , but it is about 8 at the age of 1.0 gyr .",
    "thus * a * ms peak exists only in young clusters .",
    "it moves toward a low frequency and disperses gradually with increasing age .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] show that there is another peak on the left of the ms gap for * the * cluster with age = 5.0 gyr . for stars with @xmath23 1.3 ,",
    "when their central convection ceases , the central hydrogen is not exhausted .",
    "the lower the mass , the more the * remaining * hydrogen .",
    "thus these stars can stay between * the * ms hook and hertzsprung gap for a long time , which leads to the presence of a peak or bump between the rc - ms gap and the ms gap . for the cluster with z = 0.02 and age = 7.0 gy ,",
    "the peak can become a bump . for stars with @xmath22 1.3 ,",
    "when the central convection ceases , the central hydrogen is almost exhausted .",

    "therefore the number of stars in the ms gap of a ` young ' cluster is less than that in the ms gap of an ` old ' cluster , and there is no the peak between the ms gap and rc - ms gap in ` young ' clusters .",
    "the ms hook takes place after the central hydrogen abundance of stars decreases to about 0.05 .",
    "the central hydrogen abundance of stars in the ms gap is about 0.05 - 0.001 , but that of stars in the peak on the left of the ms gap is less than 0.001 . for clusters with @xmath34 1.3",

    "although these stars are not expected to exhibit solar - like oscillations , they may exhibit other * kinds of oscillation*.    the evolutions of wide binary stars are similar to those of single stars .",
    "strong binary interactions , such as mass transfer and mass accretion , can lead to * either * a decrease or increase in the mass of * such binary * stars .",
    "the and values of these stars can * obviously be changed*. thus for a specific binary system , the effect of binary interactions on oscillations is significant . * on * the one hand , * however , * the fraction of these interactive binary stars in our samples is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of mass loss of some stars on the distributions of and can be partly counteracted by that of mass accretion of other stars .",
    "therefore , the effect of binary interactions on the distributions of and is not significant .",
    "we also calculated the bsp using @xcite imf and other assumptions for @xmath10 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , such as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 = constant @xcite , and single - star stellar population .",
    "our calculations show that results are similar .",
    "thus the assumptions concerning the bsp can not significantly affect the distributions of and * for * the fraction of interactive binary stars is not * significantly enhanced*.    the opal @xcite used in the eggleton code is out of date .",
    "however , @xcite show that the effect of the differences between opal @xcite and opal @xcite on the evolutions of low - mass stars is negligible .",
    "element diffusion for helium and metals is very important in the evolution of solar - type stars , especially for asteroseismology .",
    "however , this effect can not be considered in the hurley code .",
    "if this effect is considered , our results may be affected .",
    "the distributions of and of rc stars can be affected by the mixing - length parameter @xmath5 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the distributions can be affected by the overshooting parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the rc peak moves to a lower frequency when the @xmath6 increases .",
    "for the simulated clusters with a given age , the lower the metallicity , the lower the mass of stars in the same evolutionary phase .",
    "thus the locations of the rc and ms peaks move to a higher frequency when metallicity decreases .",
    "furthermore , the radius of ms stars is more sensitive to the initial metallicity than * the radius * of rc stats ; * so the * ms peak is more sensitive * than rc peak to * the metallicity .",
    "the age of the open clusters ngc 6866 , ngc 6811 , ngc 6819 and ngc 6791 is * approximately * 0.4 , 1.0 , 2.5 and 8.5 gyr @xcite , respectively .",
    "the fraction of fgb and rc stars in a cluster is scarcely affected by metallicity . * according to our calculations , * about 90 per cent of red giants of ngc 6866 and ngc 6811 could be rc stars , * but * about 80 per cent of red giants of ngc 6791 could be fgb stars . * in * cluster ngc 6819 , the fraction of rc stars could be approximately equal to that of fgb stars . for the cluster ngc 6791 , because the values of * the * of most fgb stars * are * larger than those of rc stars , most fgb stars could be distinguished by asteroseismical observation .",
    "the ms peak of might be observed at about 85 - 95 in ngc 6866 , and the dominant peak of rc stars could be located between 6 and 8 for ngc 6811 .    for young clusters ,",
    "there are three peaks and a gap in the distributions of and .",
    "the gap * corresponds * to the hertzsprung gap in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the ms peak exists only in ` young - age ' clusters .",
    "the dominant ms peak moves to a lower frequency with increasing age or metallicity .",
    "* stars * hotter than the red edge of the instability strip are almost * all * located on the left of the dominant ms peak for clusters with z @xmath20 0.02 .",
    "in addition , for clusters with * 1.1 @xmath42 1.3 * , there are a ms gap and a peak on the left of the ms gap in the distributions * of and * .",
    "the rc peak is caused by * the fact * that the radius of many * rc stars near the * zahb * concentrates * in a certain range ; and the ms peak is caused by * the fact * that the radius of many young ms stars with mass in a certain range concentrates in a certain range . in other words , * in a cluster , the mean density of many rc stars is approximately the same , which leads to the rc peak ; the mean density of many young ms stars with mass in a certain range is approximately the same , which leads to the ms peak . * for clusters with z = 0.02 , the frequency of location of * the * dominant rc peak increases with age when age @xmath0 1.2 gyr . *",
    "it * then decreases with age when age @xmath2 1.2 gyr , but * it * scarcely varies when age @xmath2 2.4 gyr .",
    "the helium core of stars with @xmath43 2.0 is non - degenerate , but that of stars with @xmath23 2.0 is degenerate at the time of helium ignition , which results in * the fact * that the change of * the * rc peak with age is different .",
    "the dominant peak of rc stars of the cluster with @xmath44 2.0 is located at the highest frequency . the asteroseismical observation for clusters with age @xmath0 2.4",
    "gyr may aid in testing the theory of the degeneracy of hydrogen - exhausted core .",
