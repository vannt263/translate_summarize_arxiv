    "during last decades colliders provide most of our knowledge on fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions .",
    "particle colliders can be classified concerning center - of - mass energy , colliding beams and collider types :      the ring - ring colliders are most advanced from technology viewpoint and are widely used around the world . as for the linac - linac colliders , essential experience is handled due to slc operation and ilc / clic related studies .",
    "the linac - ring colliders are less familiar ( for history of linac - ring type proposals see @xcite ) .    in table",
    "i we present correlations between colliding beams and collider types for energy frontier colliders .",
    "concerning the center - of - mass energy : hadron colliders provide highest values ( for this reason they are considered as discovery machines ) , while lepton colliders have an order smaller @xmath2 ( for this reason they are considered as precision machines ) , and lepton - hadron colliders provide intermediate @xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that differences in center - of - mass energies become fewer at partonic level . from the bsm search point of view , lepton - hadron colliders are comparable with hadron colliders for a lot of new phenomena ( for finger estimations see @xcite ) .       it should be noted that opl / operl - fcc and pwfa - lc - fcc @xmath0 colliders will give opportunity to construct also @xmath3 colliders with approximately same center - of - mass energy and luminosity . in addition approval of the fcc @xmath4 collider option will give opportunity to handle also multi - tev energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also fel @xmath5 option has a great potential for nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "these options are under consideration @xcite .",
