    "biological systems present us with a bewildering fauna of oscillators : cell cycles @xcite , circadian rhythms @xcite , calcium oscillations @xcite , pace maker cells @xcite , protein responses @xcite , and so on .",
    "sometimes , however , it is hard to see what are the minimal models behind these oscillations .",

    "( ii ) _ noise - induced oscillator _ : the fixed point is linearly stable for the system without noise and the system relaxes to the fixed point with damped oscillations when temporally perturbed .",
    "addition of noise to such a system is known to show sustained oscillations with fluctuating amplitude @xcite . for some systems ,",
    "both limit cycle oscillators ( i ) and noise - induced oscillators ( ii ) are proposed as a mechanism for the oscillation @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a way to distinguish the two , by using the phenomenon of _ entrainment _ to a periodic perturbation .",
    "it is well known that , when an periodic perturbation is added to a deterministic limit cycle , the system s oscillation frequency @xmath0 will be entrained to the external frequency @xmath1 with various rational numbers of frequencies @xmath2 for _ all _ positive integers @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a _",
    "finite window of the external frequency _ @xmath1 , where the width of the window depends on the amplitude of the external forcing @xcite .",
    "entrainment , also called mode - locking , has been observed in variety of physical systems during the last decades , from onset of turbulence @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , one - dimensional conductors @xcite , semiconductors @xcite and crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted , and verified experimentally , that the mode - locking structure possesses certain universal properties @xcite . in biological systems",
    ", entrainment has been investigated theoretically for circadian rhythms @xcite as well as in model systems for protein responses @xcite .",
    "experimental observation of entrainment in biological systems is often rather difficult due to noisy signals , but it has been observed for circadian rhythms @xcite and synthetic genetic oscillators @xcite .    in this paper , we study the difference in the entrainment behavior for the limit cycle oscillators and noise - induced oscillators . our main question is the following : can we distinguish the two cases by means of the entrainment behavior ?",
    "we employ the famous van der pol equation with noise as an example , because there we can easily study both cases by changing parameters .",
    "we show that entrainments to all the rational ratios are seen only in the limit cycle oscillator . in the case of the noise - induced oscillator with additive external forcing",
    ", the oscillator can entrain only at one - to - one ratio , meaning that the entrainment to other than the one - to - one ratio is the sign of the dominance of the limit cycle mechanism .",
    "when the external forcing is multiplicative , we find that the noise - induced oscillator with weak nonlinearity can show some entrainment ratios other than one - to - one , but not all the ratios .",

    "<S> theoretical models that describe oscillations in biological systems are often either a _ limit cycle oscillator _ , where the deterministic nonlinear dynamics gives sustained periodic oscillations , or a _ noise - induced oscillator _ , where a fixed point is linearly stable with complex eigenvalues and addition of noise gives oscillations around the fixed point with fluctuating amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how each class of model behaves under the external periodic forcing , taking the well - studied van der pol equation as an example . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , when the forcing is additive , the noise - induced oscillator can show only one - to - one entrainment to the external frequency , in contrast to the limit cycle oscillator which is known to entrain to any ratio . </S>",
    "<S> when the external forcing is multiplicative , on the other hand , the noise - induced oscillator can show entrainment to a few ratios other than one - to - one , while the limit cycle oscillator shows entrain to any ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the noise blurs the entrainment in general , but clear entrainment regions for limit cycles can be identified as long as the noise is not too strong .     * biological systems present us with a wide range of oscillators , which include cell cycles , circadian rhythms , calcium oscillations , pace maker cells , and protein responses , but it is often a challenging task to identify the minimal models behind these oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed models are typically categorized into two classes : ( i ) _ limit cycle oscillator _ </S>",
    "<S> , where fixed points are linearly unstable and the oscillations are described by stable limit cycles sustained by nonlinearities of the system which are deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> noise can be added on the top of the deterministic oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ noise - induced oscillator _ </S>",
    "<S> , where the fixed point is linearly stable for the system without noise and the system relaxes to the fixed point with damped oscillations when temporally perturbed . </S>",
    "<S> addition of noise to this type of system is known to show sustained oscillations with fluctuating amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a way to distinguish the two , by using the phenomenon of entrainment to a periodic perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> taking the van der pol equation with noise as an example , we show that entrainments to all the rational ratios are seen only in the limit cycle oscillator . in the case of the noise - induced oscillator with additive external forcing </S>",
    "<S> , the oscillator can entrain only at one - to - one ratio , meaning that the entrainment to other than the one - to - one ratio is the sign of the dominance of the limit cycle mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> when the external forcing is multiplicative , we find that the noise - induced oscillator with weak nonlinearity can show some entrainment ratios other than one - to - one , but not all the ratios . * </S>"
