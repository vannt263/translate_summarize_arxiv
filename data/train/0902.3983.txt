    "what are typical features of a quantum system whose classical limit is chaotic ? this is a central question of so - called quantum chaos  @xcite , a branch of quantum physics that has been attracting a considerable interest since 1970 s .",
    "apparently , quantum systems show no trajectories , hence no lyapunov exponents , poincar sections or other signatures constitutional for the distinction of chaos on the classical level . instead , some genuinely quantum attributes of the system seem to absorb the information on the regular or chaotic character of the classical dynamics .",
    "the best known examples are correlation properties of the spectra of energy levels . as a surprise , quantum systems with a chaotic classical counterpart",
    "show highly correlated quantum spectra , described within the theory of gaussian matrix ensembles @xcite , while the spectra of systems that are classically regular look more or less random .",
    "in recent years , alternative signatures of quantum chaos have been proposed , like the morphology of wave functions @xcite , fluctuations of the scattering matrix @xcite , sensitivity to perturbations @xcite etc .",
    "the research of these issues is by far not completed .",
    "note that the absence of an exact definition of chaos on the quantum level led to a proposal to use the term quantum chaology  instead of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the relation of spectral properties of chaotic quantum systems to those of gaussian matrices was proposed by bohigas , giannoni , and schmit in 1984 @xcite . since then",
    ", the conjecture has been tested in numerous concrete systems and supported by several involved theoretical analyses .",
    "recently , correlation properties of quantal spectra were rephrased into the language of stochastic time series with @xmath0 type of noise , the chaotic case being identified with @xmath1 @xcite .    in spite of this progress",
    ", some problems concerning the relation of the level statistics to classical chaos remain open .",
    "the following two questions , in particular , helped to guide the work presented in this article : first , if the classical dynamics exhibits abrupt transitions between dominantly regular and dominantly chaotic types of motions with varying energy , to what extent does the level statistics within a single spectrum follow these changes ? second , since the quantization is not a unique procedure , does bohigas conjecture hold in all quantum realizations of the given classical system ?",
    "the model we use to probe the above questions is the geometric model of nuclear collective motions @xcite .",
    "classical dynamics generated by this model was recently shown to exhibit an immense variability of the dynamical modes @xcite .",
    "the rise of ordered modes from the chaotic ones and their breakdown are phenomena observed at numerous places in the plane of energy versus control parameter  and in a majority of cases they are not properly understood yet .",
    "very similar properties have been assigned also to the interacting boson model @xcite , which is closely related to the geometric collective model . a detailed analysis of dynamical features of these models is an interesting and important subject in the context of nuclear physics .",
    "however , we consider these models to be very well suited also for more generally oriented studies , such as those seeking answers to the above questions .    the classical analysis of chaos in the geometric collective model has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the analysis of quantum properties .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a subset of quantum levels with zero angular momentum , which makes the configuration space effectively two - dimensional , in contrast to five - dimensional space corresponding to general motions .",
    "it is then shown that the classical version of the model for zero rotations can be quantized in two physically meaningful ways .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue problem in both cases and compare the level statistics obtained , looking particularly into the regions where transitions between regular and chaotic dynamics take place .",
    "the possibility of changing the value of a classicality ( planck ) constant enables us to populate the spectrum with variable density of quantum states , which is used for a global inspection of large energy domains and zooming in some finer details .",
    "the previous paragraph outlined the content of the present part of this paper , further referred to as part  i. in the forthcoming part , part  ii @xcite , the method invented by peres @xcite will be applied to the geometric model .",
    "the method , which exploits specific information on the structure of individual eigenstates , makes it possible to draw the spectrum of a quantum system in a way that allows one to visually allocate regular and chaotic domains . a close relation to classical dynamics ,",
    "in particular an analogy with the graphical method based on poincar sections , will be demonstrated .",
    "the plan of the present part of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ( and in appendix  [ sec : matrixelements ] ) , we introduce the model with its alternative quantizations and discuss some technical issues related to its numerical solution . the method used to evaluate the spectral statistics",
    "is described in sec .",

    "[ sec : quantumclassicalrelation ] , the results of the statistical analysis are presented and compared with the corresponding classical measures of chaos .",

    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonian of the geometric collective model ( gcm ) for zero rotations , @xmath2 , and provide two different ways of its quantization , which are referred to as five - dimensional ( 5d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) cases .",
    "the kinetic and potential terms of the gcm hamiltonian @xmath3 , @xmath4 are built from generalized complex coordinates @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) and the corresponding conjugate momenta @xmath7 , which are both spherical tensors of rank 2 .",
    "parameter @xmath8 in the kinetic part has the meaning of mass , while @xmath9 determine the form of the potential .",
    "note that @xmath10 stands for a coupling of general tensors @xmath11 and @xmath12 to angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant since it contains only scalar couplings of coordinates and momenta .",
    "the model is usually approached via an expansion of the nuclear radius into spherical harmonics , @xmath14 , with only the @xmath15 terms taken into account ; hence the name geometric model .",
    "however , the coordinates can also have different interpretations keeping only their quadrupole tensor character .",
    "the geometric hamiltonian in the above form was introduced by aage bohr in 1952 @xcite .",
    "a way of systematic construction of higher - order terms in both potential and kinetic parts of the hamiltonian was presented by gneuss , mosel , and greiner @xcite .",
    "several other types of potential have been considered in connection with shape transitions in nuclei .",
    "an overview of these potentials with relevant references and the corresponding quantum solutions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    coordinates @xmath16 satisfy the constraint @xmath17 and therefore contain five independent real variables .",
    "two of these variables capture the intrinsic shape of the nucleus ( with a quadrupole deformation ) and the remaining three variables describe the orientation of the nucleus in the laboratory frame ( they can be associated with the euler angles transforming the lab frame to the intrinsic one ) . in the intrinsic frame ,",
    "only the shape variables are relevant .",
    "these are connected with the two independent scalar combinations of @xmath16 s in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscal ] ) and are usually parametrized as follows : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this yields the potential in the form : @xmath20    standard quantization procedure with @xmath21 leads to the kinetic term @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for a nontrivial rotational part of the kinetic energy , containing the derivatives with respect to euler angles and coupling all five dynamical variables .",
    "since we restrict ourselves only to nonrotating regimes , @xmath2 , we set @xmath24 . this can be seen as a projection of the full 5d coordinate system into an effectively two - dimensional space describing vibrational degrees of freedom @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note , however , that this projection differs from the 2d case by a modified definition of the scalar product , namely : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , stands for two wave functions and @xmath30 represents a measure .",
    "appendix  [ sec : matrixelements ] gives some details , see in particular eq .  .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath31 leads to another class of solutions than would apply in case of a genuinely 2d hamiltonian .    for @xmath2",
    ", however , the truly 2d scheme represents an alternative way of quantization .",
    "it means that we put the system into the intrinsic frame first and only then carry out the quantization .",
    "the kinetic term obtained in this way reads as follows : @xmath32 which is nothing but the standard 2d kinetic energy expressed in polar coordinates @xmath33 . the scalar product in this case is defined in the usual way , therefore the space of solutions coincides with @xmath34 .",
    "note that the hamiltonian given by eqs .   and is a generalization of the widely studied h ' enon - heiles model @xcite .",
    "let us stress that in the nuclear physics context only the 5d quantization is correct .",
    "both forms and have the same classical limit for @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonians @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , with the common potential , enable one to study the impact of the quantization method on spectral correlations .",
    "although individual energy eigenvalues obtained in both quantizations are different , we may assume  as implicit in bohigas conjecture  that the spectral statistics remains essentially the same ( after correctly separating levels with different conserved quantum numbers in both cases ) .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumclassicalrelation ] . note that despite the 2d and 5d quantum hamiltonians carry a clear physical meaning , they represent just two options out of an infinite number of quantization possibilities .",
    "both versions of the @xmath2 gcm hamiltonian are diagonalized numerically , using the eigenbases of a 5d or 2d harmonic oscillator .",
    "the oscillator hamiltonian reads as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 being an arbitrary positive constant whose optimal choice will be discussed later ) and @xmath40 stands for the 5d or 2d kinetic operator or , respectively ( we denote @xmath415d or 2d ) .",
    "a general gcm hamiltonian @xmath42 is expressed as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that matrix elements of @xmath45 in both oscillator bases can be expressed analytically , which makes the process of numerical diagonalization very efficient .",
    "details and explicit expressions can be found in appendix  [ sec : matrixelements ] .",
    "the original 5d solution of the gcm possesses several implicit symmetries , namely @xmath46 with @xmath47 an arbitrary wave function in 5d .",
    "these relations arise from the ambiguity of the system s orientation in the intrinsic frame . on the other hand ,",
    "solutions of the 2d model do not a priori satisfy such symmetries .",
    "if the spectra associated with both quantizations are to be compared , conditions and need to be imposed externally also to the 2d case .",
    "this is done by selecting a subset @xmath48 ( where e stands for even in variable @xmath26 ) of the 2d oscillator basis in which the diagonalization is carried out ( see appendix  [ sec : matrixelements ] ) .",
    "in addition , if we relax condition and require only the equality of absolute values of the wave functions involved , we can take into account another independent class of 2d solutions , namely the wave functions odd in variable @xmath26 , i.e. satisfying @xmath49 .",
    "these are obtained by diagonalization in the subset @xmath50 of the 2d oscillator states ( appendix  [ sec : matrixelements ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix expressed in the truncated oscillator basis has a band form .",
    "the band width is approximately equal to the maximal value of the principal quantum number in the selected subset of basis states .",
    "this makes the diagonalization feasible even at relatively high dimensions .",
    "the convergence of solutions is checked by a visual inspection of the distribution of eigenvector components in the oscillator basis ( a bad convergence is signaled by missing tails of the computed distributions ) and/or by trial calculations using variable size of the basis ( we test the stability of computed eigenvalues against an increase of the dimension ) .",
    "our procedure guarantees that the precision @xmath51 of individual eigenvalues satisfies the condition @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an average spacing between levels in the selected part of the spectrum .",
    "this is needed for the determination of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution .    in order to make the net spectra of converged eigensolutions as large as possible , we optimize the oscillator parameter @xmath39 that determines a characteristic scale of the basis wave functions .",
    "the procedure is based on the determination of the @xmath39 value for which the trace of the gcm hamiltonian in the truncated basis is minimal ( the optimal choice of @xmath39 is however lower than this value , as empirically verified for the parameter ranges studied here ) .",
    "taking all these issues into account , we have found that on a common personal computer one can employ up to @xmath54 basis states and obtain up to about @xmath55 well converging eigensolutions ( exact numbers still depend on the choice of external parameters ) .",

    ", 2d even , 2d odd , and 5d  is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] . here",
    ", parameters of eq .   were chosen such that the potential has a minimum at @xmath56 . although the spectra in the three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] look different , very close similarities become apparent when comparing also the corresponding wave functions .",
    "this is done for selected levels in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] . at very low energies ,",
    "the system is fully regular since the minimum of the potential can be approximated by a quadratic well .",
    "wave functions belonging to this region are seen in the first and second rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] . on the other hand , the region of mixed dynamics",
    "is exemplified by wave functions in the third and fourth rows , which correspond to regular and chaotic cases , respectively . indeed whereas wave functions in the third row exhibit regular behavior ( the wave function is localized within an area following some specific classical periodic orbits @xcite ) , wave functions in the fourth row show diverse structures and cover the whole accessible area .",
    "it should be noted that the 2d and 5d cases differ in the differential element needed to calculate the probability distribution in the @xmath57 plane . in the 2d quantization we simply have @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "the first two columns of fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] show just the squared modulus of the respective wave functions . in the 5d case , however , all matrix elements contain the measure @xmath62 from eq .  . in the rightmost column of fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] we show the squared wave function @xmath63 multiplied by a factor @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting 5d density therefore vanishes where @xmath65 , so it is visually similar to the 2d _ odd _ case , in spite of the condition .",
    "this is also why the ground - state density in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf](c ) has two maxima in each potential well , although the wave function itself has no node .",
    "let us finally briefly remark on the choice of parameters in this work .",
    "it is closely connected with the scaling properties of the gcm hamiltonian discussed in refs.@xcite . in the classical case @xcite , only one of the parameters @xmath9 determines the scale - independent behavior of the system , while the others and @xmath8 can be set to @xmath66 or @xmath67 for @xmath68 . in the quantum case @xcite , the classicality parameter @xmath69 ( whose",
    "changes can be viewed either as changes of the planck constant , or as changes of the mass ) constitutes the second independent parameter of the model which can not , in general , be scaled to unity .",
    "this parameter determines the absolute density of states .    in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath70 as the principal control parameter and choose @xmath71 to locate a sufficient number of levels into the energy region of interest .",
    "the remaining parameters are fixed to @xmath72 , which in the nuclear context corresponds to nuclei with stable ground - state deformations . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the system is completely integrable ( since in this case the hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath26 and the @xmath57 angular momentum is an obvious integral of motions ) .",
    "therefore , the value of parameter @xmath70 represents the strength of a nonintegrable perturbation .",
    "let us note that all the above - introduced quantities and parameters are considered here dimensionless .",
    "the conversion to a concrete scale requires to choose the same unit for energy @xmath74 and parameters @xmath68 , @xmath70 , @xmath75 , and @xmath71 . in nuclear context",
    ", the unit of @xmath9 is set by the form of the potential ( e.g. the depth of the minimum ) .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath71 ( connected with the effective mass parameter @xmath8 ) can then be determined by adjusting the number of states in a certain interval ( e.g. below @xmath76 ) .",
    "according to bohigas conjecture @xcite , chaotic systems exhibit strong correlations between levels , which result in an effect known as spectral rigidity .",
    "the short - range component of these correlations is most clearly manifested in the distribution of the nearest - neighbor spacings ( nns ) , i.e. gaps between neighboring levels in a transformed ( so - called unfolded ) spectrum . in fully chaotic systems , this distribution is amazingly well approximated by the wigner distribution , while in systems with regular classical counterparts the nns distribution tends to be poissonian .",
    "a suitable quantity allowing one to interpolate between the two limiting cases is the brody parameter @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "it is defined through the distribution @xmath78^{\\omega+1 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the spacing between adjacent levels in the unfolded spectrum and @xmath80 a factor resulting from the required conditions @xmath81 ( normalization ) and @xmath82 ( unfolding ) .",
    "interpolates between the poisson ( @xmath83 ) and wigner ( @xmath84 ) distributions , hence a value @xmath85 $ ] obtained from a concrete spectrum tells us where between order and chaos the actual system is . in spite of an artificial character of this interpolation",

    "we use the following procedure : eigenstates obtained by the hamiltonian diagonalization in a sufficiently large basis are split into groups ( bins ) , each of them counting 1000 consecutive levels . the standard polynomial unfolding procedure @xcite is applied in each group , removing locally a smooth part of the level density and normalizing the average spacing to unity .",

    "a simple linear fit of the expression on the left - hand side of eq .   in the logarithmic scale of variable @xmath79 yields",
    "the brody parameter @xmath77 for each bin of levels .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin ] . the bins subject to the above evaluations increase in energy and overlap with each other ( the shift between successive bins was set to 100 levels ) .",
    "the average energy of each bin is drawn on the abscissa in the resulting dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath74 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : freg109][fig : freg062 ] below ) .    although the linear fit can be easily implemented and demonstrates the validity of the brody approximation over a broad domain of spacings , it may increase the relative weight of large values of @xmath79 in the calculation of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we have performed a numerical simulation showing that the value of the brody parameter determined in this way may be decreased by an absolute value @xmath91 , while the statistical error resulting from finiteness of the sample of levels is estimated as @xmath92 .",
    "these uncertainties should be taken into account when evaluating the dependence of @xmath77 on energy , see sec .",
    "[ sec : quantumclassicalrelation ] .",
    "we tried to implement also the new method @xcite based on the @xmath93 noise in spectral fluctuations , with @xmath94 $ ] corresponding to spectra in between fully chaotic ( @xmath1 ) and fully regular ( @xmath95 ) limits .",
    "the advantage of this method lies in its simple and elegant formulation ( with no explicit reference to random matrix ensembles ) and in the fact that it simultaneously captures both short- and long - range spectral correlations .    in our case , however , the results were not quite satisfactory .",
    "the reason  an insufficient statistics  may be anticipated to be present in a majority of systems in which the competition between regular and chaotic motions quickly varies with energy . indeed , the work @xcite demonstrates the power of the @xmath93 method on the robnik billiard that ( as all billiard or cavity systems ) exhibits a constant , energy - independent ratio between regular and chaotic phase - space volume .",
    "this allowed the authors to average over a huge number of successive sets of levels and to get very precise results .",
    "in contrast , properties of individual gcm trajectories can not be trivially scaled with energy .",
    "this feature , which in fact represents an important motivation for the detailed analysis of the present system , results in a significant increase of the statistical error of the deduced ( energy - dependent ) exponents @xmath16 , in some cases even exceeding 30% .",
    "in this section , we will compare the quantum measure of regularity ( brody parameter ) obtained in the way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectralstatistics ] with the corresponding classical measure .",
    "we will focus on the influence of the different quantization schemes and on the dependence of results on the classicality parameter @xmath71 .    in our previous work @xcite , classical measures of chaos in the geometric model were studied .",
    "we solved the classical equations of motions for a number @xmath96 of trajectories with fixed energy @xmath74 and then , using the method based on so - called alignment indices @xcite , classified each trajectory as either regular or chaotic @xcite .",
    "in order to quantify the overall degree of regularity at given energy , we calculated a regular fraction of the phase space @xmath97 , where @xmath98 represents the number of regular trajectories in the sample .",
    "the regular fraction @xmath99 takes values from 0 ( fully chaotic dynamics ) to 1 ( fully regular dynamics ) and it can be compared with an adjunct @xmath100 of the brody parameter .     of the classical phase space as a function of the control parameter @xmath70 and energy @xmath74 in a vicinity of @xmath101 .",
    "the degree of chaos is coded in shades of gray , with white ( black ) corresponding to complete order ( chaos ) .",

    "the energy range shown in the figures represents the most interesting region , lying between the domains of full regularity at very low and very high energies . for energies just above the global minimum of the potential",
    "the system is entirely regular due to the validity of the harmonic - well approximation .",

    "in particular , the observed maxima and minima of both curves coincide .",
    "it turns out that the brody parameter tends to slightly overestimate the regularity  this being so even if the above systematic error is considered .",

    "the model exhibits enormous complexity of solutions , with a very sensitive dependence of the observed behaviors on external parameters and energy .",
    "these features qualify the model for being a subject of detailed analyses of the competition between regular and chaotic modes of motions on both classical and quantum levels .    although the dependence of chaotic measures on some external control parameters has been extensively studied in quantum billiards , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , the dependence on energy has been marginalized so far .",
    "this is partly because billiard systems do not permit this kind of analysis  their chaotic features are always uniform in energy .",
    "even the studies based on soft  potential systems have been so far focused mostly on the cases with a relatively simple energy dependence of chaotic measures , see e.g. refs .",
    "the collective hamiltonians used in refs .",
    "@xcite and also those studied in refs .",
    "@xcite provide a very different perspective . in this sense",
    ", the present work can be considered as complementary to the studies based on two - dimensional billiard systems .",
    "we have demonstrated that a tight connection between classical and quantum measures of chaos , embodied in the well - known bohigas conjecture @xcite , remains valid even under the condition of a strong energy dependence .",
    "another important conclusion of our work is the observed independence of quantum chaotic measures on the method used to quantize the system .",
    "since the definition of quantum chaos is based on the system s semiclassical limit , it would be very surprising to find the opposite  i.e .",
    "statistical properties of spectra depending on the quantization .",
    "however , the question deserves to be tested .",
    "the present work is probably only a first step in this direction .",
    "finally , our results show that the brody parameter , despite of being often deprecated , represents a reasonably sensitive measure of chaos in quantum system .",
    "we nevertheless do not stop at this stage . in the forthcoming part of this paper @xcite ,",
    "features of the geometric model are analyzed with the aid of the method proposed by peres @xcite .",
    "this method enabled us to study the breakdown and reoccurrence of ordered quantal spectra with running parameter @xmath70 in a much more detailed way .",
