    "beginning in early december of 2010 amateur astronomers around the world observed the outbreak of a remarkably large storm in the atmosphere of saturn @xcite .",
    "this large feature is the sixth known of a class of features historically referred to as great white spots , which have occurred at roughly thirty year intervals @xcite , i.e. at intervals close to one saturnian year , always in the northern hemisphere , and usually in that hemisphere s summer .",
    "this is the first such storm observed close up by a spacecraft ( cassini ) in orbit around saturn .",
    "the cassini imaging science subsystem ( iss ) captured images of the storm beginning in december ( fig .",
    "[ fig : issimages ] ) and the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vims ) captured its first spectra of the storm in february 2011 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages ] ) .",
    "it was then centered at 35n and covered about 7 in latitude , with a long and widening downstream plume .",
    "the vertical and horizontal scale of its effects were probed by thermal infrared spectroscopy , which showed that within a month the storm generated large perturbations of atmospheric temperatures , winds , and composition over a wide area between 20n and 50n @xcite .",
    "dynamical models of such storms @xcite suggest that they originate at the 10 - 12 bar level where water vapor condensation is expected , and generate enormous convective towers reaching pressures as low as @xmath0150 mb .",
    "it is thus conceivable that these storms provide a window into the deeper layers of saturn s atmosphere .",
    "the near - ir spectral observations of vims ( from 1 to 5.15 ) are of special interest because they are particularly diagnostic of cloud particle composition .",
    "it was immediately obvious from vims spectra that the cloud particles in this storm had an unusual composition ; they displayed a surprisingly strong absorption near 3 @xcite that was not seen anywhere else on saturn ( fig .",
    "2 ) . ammonia ice ( ) and ammonium hydrosulfide ( ) , as well as water ice , are possible contributors because they are all strong absorbers in this region of the spectrum .",
    "while all of these molecules are also expected to produce clouds on saturn , a thick overlying haze has largely shielded them from view . until recently , there has been little spectroscopic evidence of any of them except in association with small storm clouds in the southern hemisphere , where excess absorption near 2.7 suggested the presence of freshly condensed @xcite .",
    "the great storm of 2010 - 2011 is by far the largest 3-absorbing feature ever seen on saturn and provides the best opportunity for detailed spectroscopic analysis .",
    "+     +   +    our objective here is to model the composition and vertical structure of the storm feature , using detailed spectral characteristics to determine the dominant components of the storm cloud particles , as well as to estimate the size of the particles and whether they are likely to be composite or pure .",
    "of all the pure substances we tried , particles of provided the best fit to the absorption feature . however , pure presents problems because its narrow strong absorption feature at 2.96 , which should be resolved by vims , is seen only weakly if at all . other characteristics of do appear to fit well , but some mechanism that suppresses the 2.96-feature seems to be required .",
    "contributions of other absorbers such as and water ice can provide improved fits , suggesting that all three substances might be present in the cloud particles , with being the most prominent contributor and water the most probable secondary component . in the following",
    "we first present the vims observations , describe our spectral analysis techniques , evaluate spectral fits for pure substances , then consider alternatives involving combinations of with other substances , both as co - mingled pure particles and as composite particles , and also as layers of different compositions .",
    "we used publicly available spectra acquired by vims during 24 february 2011 at 00:36:36 ut , data cube number 1677201862_3 , acquired under observation name vims_145sa_wind5hr001 , at a phase angle of 52and a range of 1.84@xmath1 km .",
    "the vims instrument and investigation are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the instrument s spectral range is 0.35 - 5.1 @xmath2 m , with an effective pixel size of 0.5 milliradian on a side and a near - ir spectral resolution of approximately 15 nm ( sampled at intervals of approximately 16 nm ) .",
    "the atmospheric pressures that can be sampled by this wide spectral range are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pendepth ] , which was computed for a clear atmosphere and thus over - estimates the penetration depths below the 300 mb level , where significant aerosol opacity is a limiting factor .",
    "methane is the most prominent absorbing gas at most wavelengths .",
    "hydrogen collision - induced absorption is dominant in the 1.95 - 2.15 range .",
    "phosphine is prominent in the 2.8 - 3 and 4.2 - 5 regions .",
    "arsine and have much smaller effects , and germane has too small an effect to be noticed in our investigation .        a selection of these earliest vims observations of the great storm",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages ] .",
    "remapped images are shown at three key wavelengths and spectra from seven representative locations are displayed , including means of two just upstream of the storm head and two within the storm head itself .",
    "compared to spectra at other locations , the cloud reflectivities in the storm head are the highest at 4.081 and the lowest at 3.048 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages]e , spectra obtained upstream ( locations 3 & 4 ) display absorption between 2.8 and 3 that is due to phosphine , but show little absorption at 3.05 .",
    "the upstream clouds are also more transparent at thermal wavelengths , evident from their large apparent i / f values near 5 .",
    "the storm particles are brighter than the upstream cloud particles in most window regions , somewhat more absorbing at 2.7 , but dramatically more absorbing at 3.048 .",
    "the image at 1.887 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages]a ) is used for the green component of the composite image because it provides the closest match to the i / f at 3.05 for those regions that do not contain a 3-particle absorption , both of which , along with 4.081 , are pseudo continuum wavelengths that are relatively unaffected by gas absorption .",
    "this means that the ratio of i / f at 3.048 to that at 1.887 should be a good measure of the degree of 3-absorption , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] .",
    "the regions of high reflectivity at 4.081 are places where the cloud particles are relatively large ( probably 1 or more ) , and strong absorption at 3.048 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages]b ) appears as bright orange in the color composite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages]d ) .",
    "is greatest where the ratio is smallest.,width=288 ]",
    "before proceeding with the quantitative analysis of the vims spectra , we first describe special characteristics of the vims instrument and summarize how we handle data processing , photometry , and navigation .",
    "the responsivity of the vims detector array is significantly reduced at joints between order sorting filters , which occur at wavelengths of 1.64 , 2.98 , and 3.85 @xcite .",
    "the decline is most severe at 1.64 and 3.85 , and vims spectra in these regions can not be trusted , as shown by @xcite for the 1.64 joint , and by our own radiation transfer modeling for the 3.85 joint .",
    "the spectra near the 2.98-joint are reasonably well corrected in spectra obtained during the jupiter encounter , as shown by @xcite , but minor problems are present in the vims spectra of saturn .",
    "the 2.98-joint is unfortunately located so close to the prominent ice feature near 2.96-that its effects can be misinterpreted as being due to the presence of ice .",
    "in fact , all the raw vims spectra of saturn do contain a dip very similar to what might be produced by a small component of ice in the main tropospheric haze layer .",
    "however , the spatial variation of the feature is much more easily understood as an instrumental artifact .",
    "the feature appears to be a fractional effect with no dependence on latitude or view angle , but only on the x - coordinate of the vims spectral data cube .",
    "it is not plausible that an atmospheric effect could produce this characteristic .",
    "our interpretation is confirmed by iso measurements of saturn s 3-spectrum by @xcite , which provide no evidence of such a feature .    to correct for the responsivity error caused by the 2.98-filter joint we collected spectra covering regions without strong convective features , then interpolated across the artifact for each spectrum and used the fractional depression below the interpolated line as a measure of the responsivity error that needed to be corrected .",
    "we found essentially no variation along image columns ( y - direction ) , and thus used an average fractional depression along each column to define the correction for any position along a column .",
    "we did find a significant variation perpendicular to the column direction , however .",
    "the fractional error for band 127 varied smoothly from 0.75 at column zero to 0.52 at column 63 , a change that is about 30 times the standard deviation along that column .",
    "a physical explanation for this behavior in terms of instrument design and operation remains to be determined . with this correction",
    "we are able to separate the effects of the filter joint from those of true particulate absorption in the same region of the spectrum .",
    "although a specific cause has not been identified , @xcite showed that very dark regions of vims spectra tend to be significantly brighter than independent observations from the ground and from hst using nicmos .",
    "this occurs at very low signal levels , for which the instrument is responding with 1 digital number or less .",
    "what appears to be a small offset , just a fraction of a dn , if not corrected for , leads to excessive stratospheric haze opacity in models designed to match these spectra . as we have no well - defined correction for this effect , it limits our ability to constrain the stratospheric haze , which is only noticed at wavelengths for which the atmosphere is extremely dark because of strong gas absorption .      the wavelength calibration that worked well for modeling vims jupiter spectra @xcite came from pds example calibrated data cubes , which used a set of wavelengths that was different from those contained in the jupiter flyby data cube headers . according to @xcite , the vims wavelength calibration changed since launch by about 12 to 22 nm . using comparisons with nims , they revised the vims wavelength calibration to what we believe is in the pds example calibrated data cubes .",
    "these wavelengths are the same as appear in current pds data cube headers for saturn ( except for the last wavelength ) .",
    "they also match what @xcite refer to as the rc15 wavelength calibration .",
    "but , while these wavelengths worked well for the december 2000 jupiter flyby data , hen used with the 2010 - 2011 saturn data cubes , they produce conflicts between measurements and model calculations regarding the positions of gaseous absorption bands . to align vims spectra with these absorption bands , which are accurately known from line - by - line calculations ,",
    "requires shifts of the vims wavelengths that vary with wavelength . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavecal ] , we show the results of matching 10 wavelength segments containing different absorption bands .",
    "the required shifts are a significant fraction of the 15-nm vims resolution , ranging from 12 nm near 2 to -4 nm near 5 .",
    "we found that ramped wavelength shifts lead to better spectral fits than constant segments .",
    "the ramp functions we adopted , shown as dot - dashed lines , were adjusted to roughly follow the segment shifts , and to cross zero near 5 , where the @xcite analysis of night - side saturn spectra from 2006 found good agreement between vims and model wavelengths . as shown in section [ sec : samplefit ] , fit quality is much worse if unshifted wavelengths are used .",
    "this implies that the vims instrument changed behavior between the early part of the 2000 jupiter encounter and operations at saturn in 2010 - 2011 , by almost as much as the change from pre - launch to the time of the jupiter approach .",
    "whether the change in instrument temperatures between these two time periods could have been a factor remains to be determined .",
    "vims image cubes were processed using the pipeline processing code downloaded from the planetary data system , described by @xcite . to navigate the images",
    ", we extracted spacecraft and target body states , and instrument pointing information from the index.tab files contained in the pds archive volumes .",
    "the sun to target distance was retrieved from cassini naif sp kernel files , bypassing the vims pipeline code , which used a fixed distance ( 9.033 au ) .",
    "these data allow accurate transformation between image coordinates and planet coordinates using spice toolkit software @xcite .",
    "we processed the vims data cube up through the `` specific energy '' product stage using pipeline software , and then computed the i / f using the correct sun - target distance and the solar spectrum provided in the pds volumes .",
    "the vims calibration uncertainty is at least as large as the near - ir solar spectral irradiance uncertainty of @xmath03%-5% @xcite .",
    "it appears to be less than 10% uncertain , based on window - region comparisons made by @xcite with independent spectra of jupiter .      for most applications at moderate signal levels",
    ", the random noise level of vims is very small , nominally less than 1 dn . @xcite tried to better characterize the noise by comparing spectra in cubes that imaged the same region of jupiter with as small a time difference as possible .",
    "they found measurements in the same channel to be within about 1.2 dn rms for a single measurement , even for signal levels up to 2000 dn or more .",
    "however , at signals 100 times smaller , as found near 2.3 , @xcite found a much larger fractional noise , which can be characterized as an i / f offset noise , which they crudely estimated as @xmath05@xmath3 from the on - disk spectra .",
    "other possible sources of uncertainty , though not strictly random noise , are scattered light inside the spectrometer , wavelength errors , line - spread uncertainties , and wavelength - dependent absolute calibration errors .",
    "the assumed composition of the atmosphere as a function of pressure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasmix ] . we used the @xcite temperature structure between 0.2 mb and 1.3 bars and dry adiabatic extrapolation to approximate the structure at deeper levels .",
    "@xcite used a he / h@xmath4 ratio of 0.06/0.94 in deriving their profile , and noted that the profile could be scaled to account for a different he / h@xmath4 ratio .",
    "we used the revised ratio of 0.135@xmath50.025 due to @xcite , but did not scale the lindal et al .",
    "thermal profile because that would result in disagreement with the thermal emission spectrum .",
    "the @xcite revision was motivated by a disagreement between the pre - galileo he / h@xmath4 ratio for jupiter and the accurate in situ measurements by the galileo probe .",
    "the pre - galileo result was based on a combined analysis of iris spectra and the voyager - measured radio occultation refractivity profile . in an attempt to avoid",
    "whatever error had occurred in that jupiter analysis , conrath and gautier based their saturn revision entirely on voyager iris observations . a lower value of 0.08 was given by @xcite based on cassini cirs spectra and cassini radio occultations analyzed by @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these uncertainties in the he / h@xmath4 ratio have little effect on our analysis .",
    "as long as the derived thermal profiles remain in agreement with the thermal emission spectra , which is true for all of these results , we found that our derived cloud model parameters are not very sensitive to the he / h@xmath4 ratio .",
    "test cases for ratios from 0.06 to 0.135 show that the derived cloud parameters do nt change more than their uncertainty limits . after trying a variety of values for the volume mixing ratio ( vmr )",
    ", we found the best fits were generally obtained with the @xcite value ( 4.7@xmath50.2)@xmath6 , which corresponds to a /h@xmath4 ratio of 5.3@xmath6 .",
    "for we also used the @xcite vmr value of 3@xmath7 .",
    "the most important variable gas is ph@xmath8 and its vertical profile needs to be adjusted to fit vims spectra .",
    "@xcite has shown that ph@xmath8 is enhanced over the equator and depleted over belts and within hot cyclonic polar vortices .",
    "we found that a reasonably effective parameterization was a fixed deep mixing ratio and an adjustable scale height defining its rate of decrease for pressures less than about 600 mb .",
    "our best fits outside the storm region were obtained with a deep mixing ratio of 6.4@xmath9 , which is the global mean value of @xcite , and a scale height of 37.5% of the pressure scale height . inside the storm region",
    "better fits were obtained with a more extended profile using the same deep mixing ratio and 50% of the pressure scale height .",
    "the greater scale height within the storm is consistent with increased upward transport of , as expected in regions of strong convection .",
    "we used the profile given by @xcite , which has a constant deep mixing ratio of 2.05@xmath3 , based on @xcite .",
    "more recent vla results include a value of ( 4.8 @xmath51)@xmath3 by @xcite and some evidence for depletion of in the 2 - 4 bar region , which they interpret as evidence for an cloud and h@xmath4s vapor .",
    "arsine has a noticeable affect on the vims spectra near 5 , which is where ammonia gas also plays a relatively minor role . although absorbs over a wide wavelength range , its effects",
    "are largely shielded by overlying cloud opacity .",
    "it does however have a minor influence in blocking some of the thermal radiation at wavelengths beyond 4.6 .",
    "because we wanted our correlated - k methane absorption models to be based on line - by - line calculations , we limited our spectral analysis to wavelengths greater than 1.268 .",
    "recent advances in measuring line spectra @xcite have improved line - by - line calculations so much that for @xmath10 1.268 they are now likely more accurate than band models ( see @xcite for comparisons and correlated - k models ) .",
    "we used the same line data for computing absorption models .",
    "for we used the combined correlated - k absorption model described by @xcite , which is based primarily on the goody - lorentz band model of @xcite . to model phosphine ( ) absorption we used our own exponential sum approximations based on the line data of @xcite in the 2.8 - 3.1 region and on the @xcite hitran 2008 line data in the 4.1 - 5.1 region .",
    "our model of ash@xmath8 absorption is based on line data from @xcite ( via g. bjoraker , via b. bzard , personal communication ) .",
    "where and gas absorptions overlap we compute opacities for 100 combinations of 10 terms by 10 terms and then sort and refit to a 10-term weighted sum , following the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "we do the same with all other gas overlaps in succession , which reduces all gas absorptions to ten - term exponential sum models at all wavelengths , even in regions with overlap of several gases .",
    "collision - induced absorption ( cia ) for h@xmath4 and h@xmath4-he was calculated using programs downloaded from the atmospheres node of the planetary data system , which are documented by @xcite for the h@xmath4-h@xmath4 fundamental band , @xcite for the first h@xmath4-h@xmath4 overtone band , and by @xcite for h@xmath4-he bands .",
    "although these programs and/or tables generally provide coefficients only for normal and equilibrium hydrogen , absorption for any para fraction can be derived by appropriate linear combinations of these values @xcite .",
    "we used equilibrium hydrogen generally and made test calculations with normal hydrogen to assure ourselves that our conclusions were not sensitive to the ortho / para ratio .      for multiple scattering calculations we make use of a modification of the doubling and adding code described by @xcite .",
    "the modification is to remove the raman source term , which is not needed at near - ir wavelengths , and restore the original blackbody emission source term @xcite to handle the 5-region of the spectrum .",
    "we used a grid of 44 pressure levels from 0.5 mb to 10 bars , distributed roughly in equal log increments , except that additional layers are introduced where cloud layers are inserted . as a function of wavelength",
    "we stop adding layers after the one - way vertical gas optical depth exceeds six .",
    "to model the medium phase angle vims observations we used 16 quadrature points in both zenith angle and azimuth .",
    "we followed @xcite in modeling coated - sphere particle scattering using code originated by @xcite .",
    "we approximated the line - spread function of the vims instrument as a gaussian of fwhm = 0.015 @xmath2 m , then collected all the opacity values within @xmath5fwhm of the sample wavelength , weighted those according to the relative amplitude of the line - spread function , then sorted and refit to ten terms again .",
    "a special treatment is required in the 2.9 - 3.0 region where cloud particles have very sharp absorption features . in this region model calculations",
    "were made at 5-intervals ( the maximum sampling frequency of our correlated - k models ) and subsequently smoothed to vims resolution .",
    "our cloud models usually included both vertically extended layers , where layer boundaries could be constrained by the observations , and compact layers , where the vertical extent of cloud layers could not be constrained . in some cases",
    "we evaluate both compact and vertically extended models , often finding that both can work for layers that are weakly constrained . for models where the number of adjustable parameters is relatively small ,",
    "parameters were adjusted to minimize @xmath11 using a form of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , as described by @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "model complexity is too large to reach automated convergence of all parameters in a practical time period ( or ever ) . to reduce the scale of the fitting problem and increase algorithm stability",
    ", we use constraining assumptions for a subset of the parameters , which usually can not be assigned reliable uncertainty estimates .",
    "it is important to note that formal uncertainties in the remaining fitted parameters are only valid within the context of the constraining assumptions and can not be treated as absolute uncertainties .    to speed the fitting process",
    "we reduce the total number of spectral comparisons to a set of 48 wavelengths that sample key spectral features and a wide range of gaseous absorption strengths . after fitting adjustable parameters to minimize for the sampled points ,",
    "we then compute a complete spectrum for more detailed comparisons . to test for the presence of bias due to the specific wavelengths sampled in constraining our fits",
    ", we did a fit to the location 4 spectrum with the complete set of 225 uniformly spaced wavelengths as constraints .",
    "the two resulting sets of fit parameters agreed within their uncertainties , indicating no significant bias .",
    "the constraining properties of the observations depend on the nature of measurement errors as well as on the errors in the modeling of atmospheric opacity .",
    "as previously noted , the vims random i / f measurement errors in a given wavelength channel are negligible except at very low signal levels .",
    "systematic errors are more of a concern , both in absolute calibration and in the wavelength scale , which can itself result in i / f errors when comparing to models at slightly incorrect wavelengths . a more important error source , which is not strictly random , but can vary from wavelength to wavelength , is the uncertainty in radiation transfer modeling due to the uncertainty in absorption coefficient models .",
    "the transmission curves on which previous methane opacity models were based had an assumed error of 0.05 @xcite . although not well characterized , the correlated - k models derived from line - by - line calculations also produce uncertainties .    to try to account for these effects we used the following procedure .",
    "initial model fits are used to establish a rough characterization of the vertical opacity structure of the atmosphere .",
    "we then calculate model spectra for the rough model , and for two perturbations : ( 1 ) optical depths offset by 0.01 and ( 2 ) optical depths increased by 10% .",
    "the resulting i / f differences are root sum squared with i / f errors due to wavelength uncertainties , and with an i / f offset uncertainty of 5@xmath3 and a measurement / relative calibration uncertainty assumed to be 1% .",
    "the i / f error associated with wavelength uncertainty is calculated from the derivative of the i / f spectrum with respect to wavelength times an estimated wavelength uncertainty of 0.002 , which is 1/8 of a vims line width .",
    "in some cases we assume a simpler uncertainty model , which is not cloud model dependent , but is characterized by an i / f offset uncertainty of 0.002 and a fractional i / f uncertainty of 10% .",
    "the expected @xmath11 value for the best fit is equal to the number of degrees of freedom @xmath12 ( number of points of comparison minus the number of adjusted parameters ) and the expected uncertainty in the value is equal to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , both error models result in minimum @xmath11 values several times @xmath12 .",
    "this means that either our error estimates are too low , or our physical models of the clouds are incomplete .",
    "there are many reasons for the latter to be true , including not - accounted - for effects of non - spherical particles , multi - coated particles ( more than two compositional layers ) , and heterogeneous structures , as well as more complex vertical distributions . to approximately correct for bad error estimates and incomplete physics , we rescaled our values by the factor @xmath14 before finding confidence limits .",
    "because higher than expected values are probably not simply due to bad error estimates , this procedure is not entirely valid , but is clearly better than making no adjustment .",
    "near ir spectra outside the storm regions can be very well fit by relatively simple cloud structures , which are similar to those used successfully to fit spectra in the ccd range from 0.3 to 1 @xcite .",
    "these structures contain a vertically diffuse stratospheric haze , an optically thick and physically thick main cloud layer , which requires visible and uv absorption , but can fit near ir spectra with conservative cloud particles , and a deeper layer , to which most wavelengths have little sensitivity , but which can be constrained by the thermal emission that can be sensed in the 5-region .",
    "fits of such a model structure to the vims spectra from all non - storm locations identified in figs .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages ] are summarized in table [ tbl : parvals ] , where parameter values , uncertainties , and values are all derived from the subset of 48 spectral samples discussed previously . in all these fits we characterized the deep cloud as physically compact , but optically thick ( arbitrarily set to @xmath15 = 30 ) and absorbing ( set to @xmath16=0.9 to provide adequate blocking of thermal emission ) .",
    "the only adjustable parameter of this layer was its effective pressure .",
    "as will be shown in the following , other deep cloud options could also be made to work .",
    "cloud particles in the main haze layer ( generally between 120 and 700 mb ) were treated as mie particles with refractive index n=1.4 + 0i .",
    "we fit the upper and lower pressures of this layer and its optical depth at 2 , and within the boundaries of this layer we assumed a vertical scale height equal to the gas scale height .",
    "because our values are several times the expected value ( the number of degrees of freedom ) , it is clear that either our model lacks needed physics or our measurement error estimate is too small , by a factor of @xmath17 , or some of both . if we assume that our error estimate is the problem , then we need to multiply our standard parameter uncertainty estimate ( the change needed to produce @xmath18 ) by the same factor of @xmath17 .",
    "error estimates in table [ tbl : parvals ] have this correction applied .    the complete best - fit model spectrum for location 4 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitsample ] .",
    "we also evaluated the fit quality of this spectrum using @xmath11 computed for all measured points , assuming a simplistic random error model with a reflectivity ( i / f ) fractional uncertainty of 0.1 and an offset uncertainty of 0.002 , which provides more of a relative than absolute judgment of fit quality .",
    "this provides a convenient way to compare full resolution versions of the best - fit model spectra .",
    "two values are shown in the legend of fig .",
    "[ fig : fitsample ] : the one labeled @xmath19(tot ) is computed for 1.268 - 5.15 wavelength range , and the one labeled @xmath19(abs ) is computed for the 2.65 - 3.2 range where particulate absorption features can be prominent ( in the storm region ) .",
    "all are computed with respect to the wavelength - shifted spectrum .",
    "if computed relative to an unshifted spectrum the /n ( abs ) increases from 0.26 to 2.3 and /n ( tot ) increases from 0.98 to 3.8 .",
    "this is a dramatic change that clearly confirms the need for wavelength corrections .",
    "although the fit quality for this model is very high , the model is not unique .",
    "a deep cloud that is vertically extended , with a constant optical depth per unit pressure , can fit just as well , provided it contains some absorption that increases with wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitsample ] also displays the effect of removing each model layer one at a time , and also the effect of removing various gases from the atmospheric absorption model . next to methane , phosphine has the most significant effect on the spectrum .",
    "hydrogen cia is next most significant , but limited to wavelengths from 2 to 2.2 .",
    "the stratospheric haze provides the baseline i / f in the darkest parts of the spectrum .",
    "however , because of the anomalously large i / f values measured by vims at very small i / f levels @xcite , and the small reflectivity of the small stratospheric haze particles at near ir wavelengths , what can be learned about that haze from the vims observations is rather limited .",
    "we found that a mie particle radius of 0.1 or a henyey - greenstein scatterer with wavelength dependence of @xmath20 , a pressure level of 2 mb , and an adjustable optical depth provides a suitable model .",
    "but this is not a very realistic physical model of the stratospheric haze . extending the haze downward as prior ccd - based models have done ,",
    "does not improve the accuracy of fits here , probably due to the offset errors of the vims instrument .",
    "the variety of vertical distributions that can fit the near ir spectra is similar to the variety that have been used to fit the visible spectra , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon1 ] , where we compare our fits to the non - storm spectrum from location 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vimsimages ] to models of @xcite and @xcite applicable to similar latitudes , but different time periods .",
    "the disagreements are not surprising , given the secular variation that might have occurred between the relevant observing times .",
    "we tried both broadly diffuse vertical distributions suggested by @xcite and the more compact models used by @xcite .",

    "[ tbl : extendedh2o ]            @xcite analyzed ground - based visual imaging observations covering uv and a range of methane bands for the purpose of characterizing the storm s cloud structure .",
    "their observations were modeled with a 3-layer structure consisting of a stratospheric haze , a tropospheric haze , and a bottom cloud .",
    "they found that the tropospheric haze optical depth was lower in the storm cloud than it was in the non - storm region ( 15@xmath55 vs 25@xmath55 ) , although the opacity was concentrated at higher altitudes as they inferred a cloud boundary change to 100 - 300 mb ( storm ) from 100 to @xmath321000 mb ( no storm ) .",
    "this concentration of optical depth at low pressures is at least roughly consistent with our inferences from near - ir observations , and also with our finding of a more extended main layer in the non - storm regions .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structurecomp ] , we find that the storm region is better fit with a two - component main layer , with most of the optical depth in the lower sub - layer , and with the upper sub layer extending to somewhat lower pressures than found in the non - storm regions .",
    "from an analysis of vims spectra of the giant saturn storm of 2010 - 2011 and its surroundings , we have reached the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "vims spectra outside the storm region exhibit a high degree of uniformity in the fractional depth of a 2.95 - 3.0 absorption feature across the saturn disk , with essentially no dependence on latitude or view angle , implying that the feature is primarily due to a responsivity error in the vicinity of a 2.98-joint between order - sorting filters .",
    "it also has a slight variation with the x coordinate of the vims images , but essentially no variation with the y coordinate .",
    "we developed an accurate correction algorithm that removes this feature , allowing us to detect true absorption by in the vicinity of storm clouds .",
    "most near - ir spectra of saturn outside the storm regions can be very well fit with relatively simple models consisting of ( 1 ) a deep and often optically thick cloud layer that serves to block thermal radiation in most places , but is thin enough , or deep enough , in some regions to allow 5-detection of atmospheric composition and horizontal structure at the several bar level , ( 2 ) a middle `` main '' cloud layer extending from a top pressure of 111 - 178 mb to a bottom pressure of 577 - 844 mb , with optical depths of 3.5 - 8.6 at 2 , and composed of particles that are relatively conservative scatterers , with an acceptable refractive index of n=1.4 + 0i , and ( 3 ) a stratospheric haze of low optical depth , but which can not be accurately constrained by near - ir vims observations because they are too uncertain ( and generally too large ) at very low i / f values ( near the 1 dn level ) .",
    "3 .   outside the storm - affected regions ,",
    "there is no evidence for particulate absorption at 3 , further confirming the peculiar result that at least the upper several optical depths of saturn s main visible cloud layer is not made of , , or .",
    "we can not currently rule out , but its presence seems likely to be testable in the future from measurements near 4.3 once optical constants for solid diphosphine are determined .",
    "4 .   inside the storm head",
    "we found evidence for a prominent 3- absorber in saturn s storm clouds but little indication of an absorber active near 2 .",
    "a weak 2-feature is not too surprising if the ice is confined to a cloud of relatively small optical depth overlying a relatively bright cloud that fills in the lack of reflectivity in the absorbing regions of the ice spectrum , or if the ammonia - containing cloud layer is underneath a conservative scattering layer that serves the same purpose .",
    "an uncovered optically thick layer of pure ice particles would produce a noticeable feature at 2 as well as a very prominent feature 2.96 , and thus a thick cloud of pure ice particles is not plausible as the dominant upper tropospheric cloud in the most absorbing storm regions .",
    "we considered four plausible candidate materials that might contribute significant absorption in the 3-region : , , , and h@xmath4o .",
    "fits to the observed spectrum outside of the 2.8 - 3.1 region of the spectrum were obtained for a model in which each material was taken to be the only component of the main cloud layer .",
    "we then compared the features inside 2.8 - 3.1 part of the spectrum as well as outside with the vims measured spectrum .",
    "the only substance that came close to fitting the observed spectrum was , but it had a very sharp absorption feature at 2.96 that was not present in the observed spectrum .",
    "we also considered linear combinations of the spectra obtained from the pure composition fits , as might be obtained from a heterogeneous horizontal mix of different particle types . in this case",
    "we found that the 2.96-feature could be reduced in amplitude by adding contributions from other materials .",
    "the best fits were obtained with a mix of , , and h@xmath4o , using areal fractions of 0.55 , 0.23 , and 0.22 respectively . 7 .",
    "the best fits to vims spectra using a horizontally homogeneous vertical structure model contained a deep water cloud , perhaps beginning at 10 bars , but certainly containing significant opacity above the 1 - 2 bar range , a main cloud layer consisting of two sub - layers , one of low optical depth ( @xmath33 ) above a lower sub layer of significant optical depth ( @xmath34 ) and an optically thin stratospheric haze that we could not reliably constrain because of vims limitations at very low signal levels .",
    "we initially found two options for the main layer produced good fits : ( 1 ) particles of ice in the top layer and particles of n=1.4 material ( unknown composition also present almost everywhere else on saturn ) coating a core of water ice in the lower sublayer , or ( 2 ) particles of n=1.4 in the top sublayer and in the lower sublayer as a coating on cores , with a core radius that is 40% of the total radius ( 1.5 ) , and a core volume of 6% .",
    "a slightly better fit was obtained with option ( 2 ) using smaller particles with some long - wave absorption in the upper main cloud layer and somewhat larger -coated water ice particles in the lower main sub layer . 8 .",
    "although was the best third component of our linear combination spectra that represent horizontally heterogeneous mixtures , we did not find a useful role for it in our horizontally homogeneous composite models .",
    "it might be present in small amounts in several layers , but when it becomes a significant fraction of the material in the particles , it presents spectral problems that are much easier to solve with other materials .",
    "however , it is possible that might prove useful as part of a three - component particle ( core with two coatings ) , which we do not have the tools to model .",
    "both heterogeneous and homogeneous models of the vims storm spectra strongly favor contributions by water ice , which is the first strong spectroscopic evidence for water ice in saturn s atmosphere , found near the level of saturn s visible cloud deck where it could only be delivered by powerful convection originating from @xmath0200 km deeper in the atmosphere , as expected from numerical dynamical models . 10 .",
    "the increased scale height we found for in the storm head relative to the surrounding regions ( 0.5 compared to 0.375 times the pressure scale height ) is consistent with increased upward convective transport inside the storm .",
    "we find strong evidence for the presence of ice at the top of the clouds , but at least some ( and perhaps much ) of the cloud seems to be of the same relatively conservative ( at near - ir wavelengths ) material that forms the main component of clouds over the non - storm regions .",
