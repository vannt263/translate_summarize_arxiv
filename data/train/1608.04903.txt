    "<S> the total size of the sensor ( area ) has remained approximately constant , indicating that no significant amount of ar atoms is added or subtracted during @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> it exhibits a low - power threshold of @xmath203dbm generator output power , corresponding to an rf - voltage amplitude at the sample of only a few mv zero - to - peak , considering the damping of our rf circuitry @xcite .    in the experiments described so far , </S>",
    "<S> the stm tip was positioned over the sensor 2d - islands in tunnel contact ( typically @xmath5v , 100pa ) during the rf - excitation . to minimize stm - tip effects </S>",
    "<S> , we carefully checked the tip state during the experiments and have repeated them with different tips ( tip formings ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has turned out , however , that the position of the stm tip during rf excitation is irrelevant for the sensor response . </S>",

    "<S> are displayed as difference images , where red ( blue ) color marks sensor area where ar atoms have been accumulated ( removed ) by the rf - excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the sensor response at non - tunneling conditions , fig.[fig : tip]c , is clearly revealed by the channel closing after @xmath23min ( rf power level was 4db above @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is almost indistinguishable from the response at tunneling conditions ( fig.[fig : tip]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding clearly evidences that sensor response is independent of tunneling electrons as well as the magnitude of the dc @xmath0-field between tip and sample . </S>",
    "<S> notice that edge diffusion is observed at the outermost ar atomic row of the sensor 2d - islands in all our experiments independent of rf excitation ( for details see supplementary information ) . repeating the experiments at a decreased power level of 3db below @xmath25 results in zero response ( no channel closing ) at both non - tunneling ( fig.[fig : tip]e ) and tunneling conditions ( fig.[fig : tip]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the respective decrease of power corresponds to a 50%-decrease of the rf @xmath0-field amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this result is indeed surprising : there is no response in ( f ) , although it has at least 100 times larger @xmath0-field compared to ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , sensor response depends on the rf - power level , but is uncorrelated with the strength of the rf @xmath0-field between stm tip and junction . </S>",
    "<S> our findings therefore contradict a simple @xmath0-field effect . </S>",
    "<S> notice that our argumentation holds independent of the precise value of the rf - voltage amplitude at the tunneling junction , which is not precisely known .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the non - tunneling experiments clearly rule out ( local ) joule heating at the tunnel junction , which relies on the flow of electric current @xcite , as origin of the sensor response . </S>",
    "<S> heating of the sample by microwave radiation is ruled out , because the sensor response happens in the ( reactive ) near - field of the sample surface , where emission of radiant energy is known to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> heating of the sample by absorption of electromagnetic energy in the cabling and sample crystal is ruled out because we observe negligible warming of the sample ( e.g. , only @xmath26k upon 5min of cw rf - excitation ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the presented experiments suggest that 2d - islands of ar on ag(111 ) act as motion sensors responsive to the dynamic reorganization of surface ( ad)atoms . the reorganization is caused by additional elementary diffusion processes of the sensor s atoms induced by the rf alternating electric charging and de - charging of the metal skin layer upon applying an rf - voltage to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the additional diffusion is absent at dc - voltage conditions at 5k , where only edge - diffusion is observed ( i.e. diffusion along the same atomic row starting off from a kink site ) . </S>",
    "<S> edge diffusion alone can not explain the response , because channel filling requires ar atoms to move out of an edge row to form a new edge , one row in front of the old one . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the respective energy barrier of this additional diffusion step to be on the order of @xmath27mev , based on our observation that 60min of heating the sensors to 10k ( @xmath28mev ) causes a similarly large sensor response as 5min of 530  mhz rf - excitation with power of 4db above @xmath25 at 5k ( @xmath29mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> still , fundamental questions remain : what causes the additional diffusion process ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the role of the ag substrate atoms ? in the following we discuss the underlying physical mechanism .     </S>",
    "<S> sensor response to pulsed rf - excitation . </S>",

    "<S> ( f ) dependence of the magnitude of response on @xmath30 ; red line : numerical fit @xmath33.,width=317 ]    to gain further insight , we have investigated the sensor response to pulsed rf - excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained practically the same results for pulsed experiments at tunneling and non - tunneling conditions ; for brevity we show and discuss herein only the results at non - tunneling conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied pulse trains consisting of periodic 50ns - pulses of frequency 530mhz with different values of pulse period varying between @xmath34 and 1000ns ( fig.[fig : puls]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> each pulse train contained the same total number of @xmath32 pulses , equivalent of a total on - time of 1min of the rf - excitation . compared to cw - excitation for 1min ( fig.[fig : puls]b ) , pulsed excitation yields a significantly smaller response ( fig.[fig : puls]c ) ; increasing the pulse period decreases the response further ( figs.[fig : puls]d , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that the dynamic processes underlying the sensor response exhibit a time constant @xmath35 with a value similar to the period of pulses applied . a quantitative evaluation of the @xmath30-dependence of the response is displayed in fig.[fig : puls]f . </S>",
    "<S> numerical fitting an exponential function yields a value of @xmath36ns for the time constant of the sensor response . </S>",
    "<S> this value is about six orders of magnitude larger than typical decay times of excited ( surface ) plasmons @xcite , surface - state electrons @xcite , and ( surface ) phonons @xcite on ag(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems more likely that @xmath35 belongs to the ( collective ) mechanical excitations of ar atoms involved in the restructuring of the sensors . </S>",
    "<S> similar decay times were observed for the collective vibrations of ensembles of small physisorbed molecules on au(111 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results obviously rule out several processes as origin of the sensor response : tunnel current , the electric field between stm tip and sample , local joule heating , radiative heating and heating by absorption of electromagnetic energy in the cabling and/or sample crystal . </S>",
    "<S> these findings indicate that sensor response is caused by processes in the ag sample induced by the charging and decharging at radio frequency . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we identify the periodic - in - time deviation from charge neutrality in the skin layer of the sample as origin of the observed sensor response .    </S>",
    "<S> since the dynamics of electrons and atomic lattice are known to be closely related to each other on time scales of @xmath37ns , studied herein , a manifold of different effects is expected to occur simultaneously , contributing to sensor response : ( i ) electrostriction mechanically strains the surface atomic lattice @xcite affecting the bonding geometry ; reversible mechanical strain as large as 0.15% has been observed in charged nanoporous pt samples @xcite , corresponding to mechanical stress of about 1gpa . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the application of an rf voltage is expected to enforce mechanical vibrations of the surface atomic lattice at the same frequency ( here 530mhz ) with amplitude @xmath38 , contributing to the measured dc tunnel current via the well - known relation @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> notice , that the rf - induced change of sample surface height @xmath38 may be misinterpreted as `` rf - induced contribution to dc bias voltage '' , `` apparent shift of work function '' , or `` apparent smearing of @xmath40 '' ( at const-@xmath41 and const-@xmath4 conditions ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) excitation of acoustic surface plasmons ( asps ) , known to exist on ag(111 ) @xcite , is expected to influence adsorbate dynamics ( here : sensor response ) , since the decay of asps can generate ( surface ) phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our sensors promise to facilitate future experimental studies on the rf - excitation of asps . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) electric polarization of the surface atoms induces repulsive electrostatic forces between neighboring atoms or even affects the van der waals - london dispersion forces of ar - ar as well as ar - ag atoms @xcite , facilitating enhanced ar diffusion .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that nano - fabricated monolayer 2d - islands of ar on ag(111 ) at 5k act as experimental probes for detecting surface ( ad)atom mechanical motion and dynamic processes . </S>",
    "<S> to showcase the strength of our method , we reveal a dynamic reorganization of surface ( ad)atoms at the ar / ag(111 ) interface , caused by radio - frequency charge - density oscillations and related electric fields induced by an external rf voltage . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental method is expected to enable quantitative characterization of atomic structural dynamics with unprecedented detail , in general . </S>",
    "<S> this is relevant , in particular , for the study of weakly bound systems with nanometer spatial- and nanosecond temporal resolution , including monolayer solids , surfaces , ( hetero)interfaces and 2d nanostructures . </S>"
