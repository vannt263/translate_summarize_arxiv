    "since its discovery by the selex collaboration  @xcite , the doubly charmed baryon @xmath12 has attracted more and more attentions .",
    "a recent experimental research for @xmath0 has been done by the lhcb collaboration at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the selex measurements indicate that there are large discrepancies between the theoretical prediction and the experimental observation .",
    "its measured decay widths and production rates are much larger than the theoretical predictions .",
    "lots of theoretical works have been tried to resolve such discrepancy  @xcite . especially , a generator genxicc has been programmed to simulate the production of the doubly heavy baryons at the hadronic colliders as tevatron and lhc  @xcite . by using genxicc",
    ", it has been stated that @xmath0 should be visible if an integrated luminosity @xmath13 fb@xmath11 has been collected at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the present limited experimental measurements , the puzzle is still there .    on the one hand , we need to improve our present theoretical estimations by studying all possible quark configurations for constructing the baryon and by taking more production or decay channels into consideration . on the other hand , in addition to selex , it is helpful to find some other platforms which can generate large number of baryons so as to study their properties with higher precision .",
    "for example , the possibilities for studying the doubly heavy baryons at a high luminosity @xmath14 collider or a photon - photon collider have been suggested in refs.@xcite . a high luminosity @xmath14 collider or a photon - photon collider has some advantages for measuring the baryon events , such as the cleanness of the physical background and etc .. thus ,",
    "if sizable baryon events can be produced at such colliders , they shall provide a good platform for testing the qcd factorization theory .    for the baryon production at the hadronic platforms",
    ", the baryons can be produced through scattering , annihilating , or fusing of two initial partons inside the incident hadrons . in comparison to the @xmath14 collider , the hadronic production are complicated due to the entanglement of the perturbative kernel with the nonperturbative parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "but , inversely , if we have known more accurate baryon properties in comparison with the experimental data , we can learn more details on the properties of hadron structures .",
    "so , to study the baryon productions at the hadronic colliders are also helpful and interesting .",
    "recently , similar to the selex experiment done at the tevatron , another fixed target experiment at the lhc ( after@lhc ) has been suggested  @xcite . with the incident proton beam energy",
    "raises up to @xmath15 tev at the lhc , the after@lhc shall run with the center - of - mass energy around @xmath16 gev . with a much higher luminosity and higher collision energy , the after@lhc shall become a much better fixed - target experiment for studying the properties of the doubly heavy baryons . in the present paper , we shall present a detailed investigation on the @xmath0 production at the after@lhc by taking both the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism via the subprocess @xmath2 and the the extrinsic charm mechanism via the subprocesses @xmath3 and @xmath4 into consideration . as a by product",
    ", we shall also estimate the production properties for the @xmath7 and @xmath17 baryons .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we explain our calculation technology for dealing with the @xmath0 production . in sec.iii",
    ", we present our numerical results for the doubly heavy baryons @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "sec.iv is reserved for a summary .",
    "theoretically , the production of the doubly heavy baryons , such as @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath17 , can be treated within the framework of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the doubly heavy baryon can be formed via a step - by - step way .",
    "the first step is to produce two free heavy - quark pairs @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 or @xmath21 stands for @xmath22 or @xmath23 quark , respectively .",
    "the gluon between those two heavy - quark pairs should be hard enough to generate either a @xmath18-pair or a @xmath19-pair , so this step is calculable by applying pqcd .",
    "the second step is to make those two heavy quarks @xmath20 and @xmath21 into a bounding diquark @xmath24 with the @xmath25 $ ] ( or @xmath26 $ ] ) spin state and the @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) color state , respectively .",
    "then , the diquark will be hadronized into a @xmath29 baryon , whose probability is described by the non - perturbative nrqcd matrix element @xmath30 or @xmath31 . here , @xmath30 represents the probability for a @xmath32-diquark pair in @xmath33 $ ] to transform into the baryon and @xmath34 represents the probability for a @xmath32-diquark pair in @xmath35 $ ] to transform into the baryon .",
    "qualitatively , the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are at the same order  @xcite , so we shall take @xmath36 to do our following discussion .",
    "for @xmath7 , there are other two diquark states , @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] , we shall also take their matrix elements as @xmath39 .",
    "strictly , during the fragmentation of a diquark into a baryon , the diquark may dissociate , which will decrease the baryon production cross section to a certain degree .",
    "it has been observed that the fragmentation function @xmath40 of a heavy diquark into a baryon peaks around @xmath41  @xcite . by taking a simple form for the fragmentation function @xmath40 , refs.@xcite",
    "indicate that such disassociation effect is small .",
    "thus , at present , we have implicitly assumed that the fragmentation of a diquark into the baryon shall occur with unit probability , and consequently , to study the hadronic production of @xmath0 is equivalent to study the hadronic production of @xmath42-diquark .",
    "a detailed discussion on such disassociation effect is in preparation .",
    "our present estimations can be treated as a ( somewhat good ) upper limit for the total baryon cross sections .     with the diquark state",
    "@xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath20 or @xmath21 stands for @xmath22 or @xmath23 quark , respectively .",
    "the dashed boxes stand for the hard interaction kernel , each contains @xmath44 feynman diagrams.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]            there are two typical mechanisms for the production of baryons , i.e. the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism via the subprocess @xmath2 and the the extrinsic charm mechanism via the subprocesses @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the subprocesses for the production of doubly heavy baryon through different mechanisms are shown in figs .",
    "[ gg ] , [ gc ] , and [ cc ] , respectively . by simultaneously taking the gluon - gluon fusion and extrinsic charm mechanisms into consideration ,",
    "one will meet the double counting problem  @xcite , which can be treated within the general - mass with variable - flavor - number scheme  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic production conditions for the @xmath7 and @xmath17 baryons are similar to the @xmath0 case , so we shall also take a look at their production properties . for @xmath7 and @xmath17 production ,",
    "we merely focus on the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , since the extrinsic mechanisms of them shall provide comparatively small contributions .",
    "it is noted that the intermediate diquarks in @xmath0 and @xmath17 have two spin and color configurations , @xmath25_{\\bf\\bar{3}}$ ] and @xmath26_{\\bf 6}$ ] ; while for the intermediate diquark @xmath45 in @xmath7 , there are four spin and color configurations : @xmath46_{\\bf\\bar{3}}$ ] , @xmath46_{\\bf 6}$ ] , @xmath47_{\\bf\\bar{3}}$ ] , and @xmath47_{\\bf 6}$ ] .",
    "we shall take all those configurations into consideration , since all of them may provide sizable contributions .",
    "we adopt genxicc program  @xcite with slight changes to do our calculation . as for the input parameters , we take  @xcite : @xmath48 gev@xmath49 , @xmath50 gev@xmath49 , and @xmath51 gev@xmath49 . as for the baryon masses , we take @xmath52 gev with @xmath53 , @xmath54 gev with @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 gev , @xmath57 gev with @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we choose the cteq with the version ct10  @xcite for the pdf of the gluon or the quarks .",
    ".total cross sections for the @xmath0 production at the after@lhc with @xmath59 gev , where the intermediate @xmath42-diquark is in @xmath25_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ ] or @xmath26_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig.([ptcc ] ) indicates that the baryon cross sections depend heavily on the baryon @xmath62 .",
    "total cross sections shall first increase with the increment of @xmath62 in small @xmath62 region and then drop down logarithmically in large @xmath62 region .",
    "experimentally , it is also possible to apply more @xmath62 cuts to the production channels . to show how the baryon production depends on @xmath62",
    ", we put the @xmath0 cross sections for various production channels and various @xmath62 cuts in table [ ptcut ] .",
    "table [ ptcut ] shows : for @xmath63 channel , @xmath64 ; for @xmath65 channel , @xmath66 .    moreover , by taking the @xmath0 production via the gluon - gluon fusion as an explicit example , we present the rapidity distributions under various @xmath62 cuts in fig.([cutcc1 ] ) , where the contributions via the @xmath42-diquark states @xmath25_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ ] and @xmath26_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] have been summed up .",
    "@xmath62 distributions at the after@lhc and the selex experiments , where all production channels have been summed up , @xmath67 gev and no rapidity cut has been applied . ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at the after@lhc , similar to the case of selex  @xcite , the small @xmath62 behavior for the extrinsic charm mechanism becomes very important .",
    "thus , the extrinsic charm mechanism should be taken into consideration for a sound estimation . as a comparison",
    ", we draw the @xmath0 @xmath62 distributions for both the selex and the after@lhc experiments in fig.([a&s ] ) , where all production channels have been summed up . in small @xmath62 region , the @xmath0 @xmath62 distribution at the after@lhc is larger than that of selex by about an order of magnitude . in large @xmath62 region ,",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath62 distributions at both the after@lhc and the selex drop down logarithmically .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 @xmath62 distribution drops down more slowly at the after@lhc .",
    "this is due to a larger collision energy at the after@lhc : i ) a larger collision energy means more small @xmath68 events , or equivalently more small @xmath62 events , can be generated at the after@lhc ; ii ) it is noted that the pdfs for the incident partons drop down logarithmically with the increment of the parton fraction @xmath68 , as can be explicitly shown by ct10  @xcite .",
    "thus , more small @xmath68 events leads to more larger cross sections .",
    "it is noted that the extrinsic charm mechanism via the channels @xmath3 and @xmath4 provide dominant contribution to small @xmath62 events . to estimate the extrinsic charm mechanism for @xmath0 production ,",
    "we define a ratio , @xmath69}},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 stands for the total cross section for all the concerned mechanisms in the @xmath0 production , and @xmath71}$ ] is the total cross section for the channel @xmath72+\\bar{c}+\\bar{c}$ ] only . at the selex , the ratio @xmath73  @xcite , which changes to @xmath74 at the after@lhc .",
    "thus , the after@lhc is also possible to test the charmonium components in hadron .",
    "there are some minor points for the present analysis :    * in the above estimations , we have fixed the renormalization scale @xmath75 to be the baryon s mass @xmath76 . for the present leading - order pqcd calculation",
    ", the scale uncertainty is large , e.g. , for the @xmath0 production via the @xmath65 channel , the scale uncertainty is @xmath77 for @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 stands for the collision energy of the incident partons .",
    "however , by adopting an improved scale analysis suggested in ref.@xcite , which is based on the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc )  @xcite , we shall obtain a smaller and hence a more reliable scale uncertainty @xmath80 for @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "* in the above discussions , we have not distinguished the light components in the baryon .",
    "more subtly , for @xmath0 production , after forming a @xmath42-diquark , it will grab a light anti - quark ( with soft gluons when necessary ) from the hadron to form the final colorless doubly heavy baryon . according to the string model  @xcite",
    ", the possibility for grabbing the light ( sea ) quark from the hadron is @xmath81 .",
    "if a @xmath42-diquark is produced , it will fragment into @xmath82 with @xmath83 probability , @xmath84 with @xmath83 probability and @xmath85 with @xmath86 probability .",
    "then , if enough @xmath0 events can be accumulated at the after@lhc , one may have chances to study the @xmath87 or @xmath85 separately from their decay products .",
    "* as has been estimated , there are two dominant @xmath12 decay channels , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . setting @xmath90 to be the decay widths of these two channels",
    ", we have  @xcite : @xmath91 . as a rough estimation ,",
    "if taking @xmath92 and the integrated luminosity to be 2 fb@xmath11 , we shall have @xmath93 @xmath12 events from the first decay channel and @xmath94 @xmath12 events from the second decay channel at the after@lhc .",
    "we have presented a detailed discussion on the doubly heavy baryon production at the suggested fixed target experiment after@lhc . for a fixed target experiment ,",
    "more smaller @xmath62 events can be measured in comparison to the hadronic experiments as lhc and tevatron .",
    "since the baryon @xmath62 distributions drops down logarithmically in large @xmath62 region , this indicates that more baryon events can be produced at the after@lhc .",
    "if the integrated luminosity at the after@lhc reaches up to @xmath95 per year , sizable @xmath0 and @xmath7 events can be generated , i.e. , about @xmath96/year @xmath0 and @xmath97/year @xmath7 maybe observed for a small @xmath62 cut , @xmath67 gev .",
    "if its luminosity can be improved further , we shall have much more baryon events available .",
    "moreover , because of a larger collision energy than that of selex , more small @xmath68 events and more small @xmath62 events can be generated at the after@lhc .",
    "thus , the after@lhc experiment shall provide a good platform to study the baryon properties and may greatly help to clarify the present selex puzzle .",
