    "we have been monitoring the central region of m31 with _ chandra _ , averaging @xmath01 observation per month over 19992012 , in order to discover x - ray transients .",
    "since then , we have reduced our observation rate to 5 per year . particularly bright or otherwise interesting",
    "transients are followed up with two _ hst _ acs observations , the first is taken a few weeks after outburst , and the second observation is normally taken @xmath06 months later ; this allows us to identify the counterpart via difference imaging ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "we summarized the results of the first 12 transients ( labeled t1t12 ) found via this effort in @xcite , and performed this analysis for two further transients : xmm j004243.6 + 412519 ( known as m31 ulx2 , * ? ? ? * ) , and cxom31 004252.457 + 411631.17 ( referred to as t13 , * ? ? ? * ) .    in this work",
    "we report our findings for cxom31 004205.77 + 411330.43 , hereafter referred to as t14 .",
    "we note that t14 is source number 71 in our variability survey of 528 x - ray sources within @xmath020@xmath5 of the galaxy nucleus where we made @xmath0200 new x - ray binary ( xb ) identifications @xcite ; the 0.310 kev luminosities for these sources ranged over @xmath016000@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the initial outburst of t14 was in 2011 july ; however , the second observations was made almost 3 years later , in 2014 june .",
    "x - ray transients within the central region of m31 are most likely to contain a low mass secondary , as the majority of stars there are old ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) may be transient x - ray sources due to instabilities in their accretion disks ; the disk has two stable phases ( hot and cold ) , and an unstable intermediate phase matter accumulates in the disk in the cold phase , and is rapidly dumped onto the compact object in the hot phase ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the x - rays produced by accretion from the hot disk prevent the disk from cooling ; the x - ray luminosity decays exponentially if the whole disk is ionised , and linearly if only part of the disk is ionised@xcite .",
    "@xcite found an empirical relation between the ratio of x - ray and optical luminosities of galactic x - ray binaries and their orbital periods , suggestive that the optical emission is dominated by reprocessed x - rays in the disk ; this relation holds over a 10 magnitude range in optical luminosity , and appears to be independent of inclination .",
    "their chosen x - ray band was 210 kev .",
    "for an irradiated accretion disk with radius @xmath8 , x - ray luminosity @xmath9 , optical luminosity @xmath10 , and temperature @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath9/@xmath14 , while the surface brightness of the disk , @xmath15 , @xmath13 @xmath16 for typical xbs @xcite . since @xmath10 @xmath13 @xmath17 , @xmath10 @xmath13 @xmath18 ; also @xmath8 @xmath13 @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the orbital period .",
    "@xcite defined @xmath21 = @xmath22 , choosing @xmath23 = 2.5@xmath24 erg s@xmath7 as a normalizing constant , and found @xmath25 however , @xcite sampled a mixture of neutron star and black hole binaries , in various spectral states .",
    "a cleaner sample was obtained by a. moss et al .",
    "( 2015 , in prep ) , who used only black hole transients at the peaks of their outburst , and found @xmath26 we note that these two relations only differ significantly in normalization , caused by black hole x - ray binaries having larger disks than neutron star binaries with the same period .",
    "we have period estimates for 14 m31 transients ( t1t12 , ulx2 , and t13 ) observed by _ _",
    "chandra _ _ and _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "these period estimates appear to be slightly shorter over all than for galactic transients , ranging from @xmath271 hr to 140@xmath28 hr , and mostly @xmath2730 hr @xcite .",
    "we observed the region containing t14 in 101 _ chandra _ observations ( 60 acis , 41 hrc ) .",
    "we observed t14 in outburst for 5.2 ks with the hst / acs on 2011 july 21 using the f435w filter and the wfc mode ( or `` aperture '' ) ( h1 , jbm105010 , pi m. garcia ) ; the 4.8 ks observation in quiescence occurred on 2014 june 26 ( h2 , jc6b02010 , pi r. barnard ) , using the wfc1-cte aperture .",
    "the wfc1-cte aperture improves the charge transfer efficiency by moving the target to the corner of a detector , allowing point sources to be more circular , but does not effect sensitivity ; hence the level of background observed in h2 is unaffected by this change .",
    "we also analyzed a 2001 june 29 @xmath060 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation containing a previous outburst that had sufficient counts for spectral fitting ( 0109270101 , pi k. mason ) .",
    "all optical analysis was performed with pc - iraf revision 2.14.1 , except where noted .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations were analyzed with ciao version 4.6.3 and sas version 13.0 respectively ; x - ray spectra from both telescopes were treated with xspec version 12.8.2b .",
    "each _ hst _ observation included four flat - fielded ( flt ) images , and one drizzled ( drz ) image .",
    "the flat - fielded images are corrected for instrumental effects , but not background subtracted ; the total number of counts in each pixel is given .",
    "the native acs resolution is comparable to the fwhm of the psf @xcite .",
    "the drizzled image combines the flat - fielded images , removes any cosmic rays , and subtracts the sky background ; it is normalized to give the number of counts per second per pixel .",
    "we used the drz images from h1 and h2 to create a difference image ; however , we used the h2 flt images for our aperture photometry because the drz images sometimes contain pixels with slightly negative values , and this can cause problems when estimating the number of photons in a region .",
    "we reprojected the h2 drz image into the coordinates of the h1 drz image , to produce an accurate difference image . to do this , we first registered the h1 and h2 images to the lgs field 5 image with ccmap , using unsaturated stars that were close to the target",
    ". then , we used the iraf task wregister to make the pixel orientation of the h2 image match that of the h1 image .",
    "we registered the h2 image to the h1 image before mapping to reduce the noise during image subtraction .",
    "the difference image was produced by subtracting h2 from h1 using the ftools task farith .      for h1 and h2 we found the number of photons for each flt image within various extraction regions , yielding @xmath29 photons in total over @xmath11 seconds .",

    "* and references within ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation suffered substantial flares in the particle background due to soft solar protons .",
    "we selected good time intervals by making a 1012 kev pn lightcurve from the whole image with 100 s binning , using standard filters .",
    "we extracted source source and background spectra from the pn , mos1 and mos2 data : source spectra from a circular region that was optimized by the software ( 17@xmath41 radius ) , and background spectra from a nearby circular region on the same ccd with no point source ( 35@xmath41 radius ) .",
    "we grouped the source spectra to give a minimum of 20 counts per bin , created the corresponding response matrixes and ancillary response files , then fitted the spectra with xspec .",
    "the pn , mos1 , and mos2 spectra were fitted simultaneously with constants of normalization to account for differences in detector responses .",
    "we obtained uncertainties in the best fit parameters by simulating 1000 spectra with the multifake command , with deviations in simulated spectra being drawn from the properties of the observed spectrum .",
    "the best fit parameters for these spectra were each ranked in ascending order , with 1@xmath34 uncertainties derived from the 160@xmath42 and 840@xmath42 data points .",
    "we used 27 x - ray bright globular clusters ( gcs ) to register a combined @xmath0350 ks acis image ( supplied by z. li ) to the b band field 5 image of m31 provided by the local galaxy group survey ( lgs ) @xcite .",
    "we used pc - iraf v2.14.1 to perform the registration , following the same procedure as described in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray and lgs positions of the 27 x - ray bright gcs were determined using imcentroid ; the equivalent fk5 coordinates were calculated for the x - ray and optical position of each gc using xy2sky v2.0 , distributed with ftools .",
    "the x - ray positions of each gc were altered to match the lgs positions , allowing the registration of the merged _ chandra _ image to field 5 using the iraf task ccmap .",
    "this registration yielded 1@xmath34 position uncertainties of 0.11@xmath41 in r.a . , and 0.09@xmath41 in dec @xcite .",
    "the final uncertainties in the x - ray position of t14 combine the position uncertainties in the x - ray image , and the uncertainties in registering the merged _ chandra _ image to the m31 field 5 lgs image .      even the best _ chandra _ acis spectrum for t14 yielded few counts .",
    "we modeled the spectrum in xspec in two ways : i ) using a small number of bins with @xmath4320 counts per bin and @xmath44 statistics ; and ii ) using a larger number of bins with @xmath435 counts per bin and cash statistics .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties for each spectral fit using the same method as for our analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum .      for each of our _ chandra",
    "_ acis observations we extracted source and background 0.37.0 kev spectra from circular regions with 10@xmath41 radii .",
    "we then created a response matrix using mkacisrmf , and obtained an ancillary response file from mkarf .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using xspec , giving unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosities for each observation , allowing us to create a long - term luminosity lightcurve .",
    "most of the _ chandra _ observations of t14 yielded too few photons for spectral fitting .",
    "however , we are able to estimate the 0.310 kev flux ( and therefore luminosity ) by assuming a particular emission model",
    ". if this model is a good approximation , then the luminosities of closely - spaced acis and hrc observations should agree ; however , if the model is inappropriate , then the acis and hrc luminosities should be systematically offset , due to differences in instrumental response .",
    "for each faint acis spectrum we used xspec to estimate the unabsorbed 0.310 kev flux equivalent to 1 count s@xmath7 , assuming the best fit emission model for the _ xmm - newton _ pn spectrum of t14 . multiplying this number by the background - subtracted intensity yields a flux that is corrected for instrumental effects , and we obtain the luminosity by assuming a distance of 780 kpc @xcite .",
    "it was important to do this for every observation because the roll angle was not constrained , meaning that the source appeared in different parts of the detectors , at various off - axis angles .    for hrc observations",
    ", we included only pi channels 48293 , thereby reducing the instrumental background .",
    "we used the webpimms tool to find the unabsorbed luminosity equivalent to 1 count s@xmath7 , assuming the same emission model as for the acis observations .",
    "we created a 1 kev exposure map for each observation , and compared the exposure within the source region with that of an identical on - axis region , in order to estimate the exposure correction .",
    "we multiplied the background subtracted , corrected source intensity by the correction factor to get the 0.310 kev luminosity .",
    "the uncertainty in x - ray position for t14 is 0.3@xmath45 in r.a . and 0.4@xmath45 in dec @xcite .",

    "in @xcite we used a circle with 3 pixel radius ( 3@xmath46fwhm ) to estimate the flux for t13 ; however , this was impossible for t14 because this region was severely contaminated by cosmic rays in the h2 image , and the h2 intensity ( 7.6@xmath10.08 count s@xmath7 ) was substantially higher than the h1 intensity ( 5.5 count@xmath10.04 s@xmath7 ) . extracting counts from a 3@xmath47 pixel region yielded very similar result to extraction from a 2@xmath462 pixel region : background - subtracted intensities of 0.11@xmath10.02 and 0.10@xmath10.02 count s@xmath7 respectively .",
