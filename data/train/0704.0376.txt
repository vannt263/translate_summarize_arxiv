    "the major challenge for quantum computation is posed by the fact that generically quantum states are very delicate objects quite difficult to control with the required accuracy  typically , by means of external driving fields , e.g. , a laser .",
    "the interaction with the many degrees of freedom of the environment causes decoherence ; moreover , errors in processing the information may lead to a wrong output state .    among the approaches aiming at overcoming these difficulties",
    "are those for which the quantum gate depends very weakly on the details of the dynamics , in particular , the holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) @xcite and the so - called stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the gate operator is obtained acting on the phase difference of the driving lasers during the evolution , while in the former the same goal is achieved by exploiting the non - commutative analogue of the berry phase collected by a quantum state during a cyclic evolution .",
    "concrete proposals have been put forward , for both abelian @xcite and non - abelian holonomies @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the hqc is the robustness against noise deriving from a imperfect control of the driving fields @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that the disturbance of the environment on holonomic gates can be suppressed and the performance of the gate optimized for particular environments ( purely superohmic thermal bath ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider a different sort of optimization , which is independent of the particular nature of the environment .    by exploiting the full geometrical structure of hqc",
    ", we show how the performance of a holonomic gate can be enhanced by a suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the parameters of the external driving field : by choosing the optimal loop which minimizes the `` error '' ( properly estimated in terms of average fidelity loss ) .",
    "our result is based on the observation that there are different loops in the parameter manifold producing the same gate and , since decoherence and dissipation crucially depend on the dynamics , it is possible to drive the system over trajectories which are less perturbed by the noise . for a simplified , albeit realistic model , we find the surprising result that the error decreases linearly as the gating time increases .",
    "thus the disturbance of the environment can be drastically reduced . on the basis of this result",
    ", we compare holonomic gates with the stirap gates .    in sec .",
    "ii the model is introduced and the explicit expression of the error is derived . in sec .",
    "iii we find the optimal loop , calculate the error , make a comparison with other approaches , and briefly sketch how to treat a different coupling with the environment .",
    "the physical model is given by three degenerate ( or quasidegenerate ) states , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , optically connected to another state @xmath3 .",
    "the system is driven by lasers with different frequencies and polarizations , acting selectively on the degenerate states .",
    "this model describes various quantum systems interacting with a laser radiation , ranging from semiconductor quantum dots , such as excitons @xcite and spin - degenerate electron states @xcite , to trapped ions @xcite or neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "the ( approximate ) hamiltonian modeling the effect of the laser on the system is ( for simplicity , @xmath4 ) @xcite @xmath5   \\mathbf{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 are the timedependent rabi frequencies depending on controllable parameters , such as the phase and intensity of the lasers , and @xmath7 is the energy of the degenerate electron states .",
    "the rabi frequencies are modulated within the adiabatic time @xmath8 , ( which coincides with the gating time ) , to produce a loop in the parameter space and thereby realize the periodic condition @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : system_hamiltonian ] ) has four time dependent eigenstates : two eigenstates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , called bright states , and two eigenstates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , called dark states .",
    "the two dark states have degenerate eigenvalue @xmath7 and the two bright states have timedependent energies @xmath14/2 $ ] with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the state is generated by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the time - ordered operator . in the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the evolution of the state takes place in the degenerate subspace generated by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "this approximation allows to separate the dynamic contribution and the geometric contribution from the evolution operator .",
    "expanding @xmath21 in the basis of instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath22 ( the bright and dark states ) , in the adiabatic approximation , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the operator with matrix elements @xmath26 . the unitary operator @xmath27 plays the role of timedependent holonomic operator and is the fundamental ingredient for realizing complex geometric transformation whereas @xmath28 is the dynamic contribution .",
    "consider @xmath27 for a closed loop , i.e. , for @xmath29 , @xmath30 if the initial state @xmath31 is a superposition of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is still a superposition of the same vectors ( in general , with different coefficients)@xcite .",
    "thus the space spanned by @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be regarded as the `` logical space '' on which the `` logical operator '' @xmath35 acts as a `` quantum gate '' operator .",
    "note that for @xmath36 , @xmath37 has , in general , also a component along @xmath38 .",
    "however , as it is easy to show @xcite , at any instant @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be expanded in the twodimensional space spanned by the dark states @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to observe that @xmath35 depends only on global geometric features of the path in the parameter manifold and not on the details of the dynamical evolution @xcite .    to construct a complete set of holonomic quantum gates , it is sufficient to restrict the rabi frequencies @xmath41 in such a way that the norm @xmath42 of the vector @xmath43 $ ] is time independent and the vector lies on a real three dimensional sphere @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the evolution on this sphere as @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 with fixed initial ( and final ) point in @xmath47 , the north pole by straightforward calculation we obtain the analytical expression for @xmath48 in eq .",

    "we make a comparison between holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) and the stirap procedure which is an analogous approach to process quantum information . the stirap procedure ( @xcite ) is , in its basic points , very similar to the holonomic information manipulation .",
    "the level spectrum , the information encoding , the evolution produced by adiabatic evolving laser are exactly the same .",
    "the fundamental difference is that in stirap the dynamical evolution is fixed ( we must pass through a precise sequence of states ) and then the corresponding loop in the parameter space is fixed . in particular , we go from the north pole to the south pole and back to the north pole along meridians . since the loop , as in our model , is a sequence of meridian - parallel - meridian path , we can calculate the error and make a direct comparison . in this case",
    ", the transition error results proportional to @xmath140 and grows linearly in time while for hqc @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , the hqc is fundamentally the favorite for long application times with respect to the stirap ones .",
    "moreover , we can show that the freedom in the choice of the loop allows us to construct hqc which perform better than the best stirap gates . in ref .",
    "@xcite the minimum error ( not depending on the evolution time ) for stirap was obtained reaching a compromise between the necessity to minimize the transition , pure dephasing error and the constraint of adiabatic evolution . with realistic physical parameters @xcite ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 mev , @xmath160ev , @xmath161 , @xmath162mev@xmath163 mev and for low temperature ) , the total minimum error in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath164 . with the same parameters",
    ", we still have the possibility to increase the evolution time in order to reduce the environmental error .",
    "however , for evolution time @xmath165 ps we obtain a total error @xmath166 for the not gate and @xmath167 for the hadamard gate , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the logical gate performance is greatly increased .      until now we have discussed the possibility to minimize the environmental error by choosing a particular loop in the parameter sphere but the structure of the error functional clearly depends on the system - environment interaction .",
    "then one might wonder if the same approach can be used for a different noise environment .",
    "for this reason , we now briefly analyze the case of noise matrix in the form @xmath168 .",
    "again , for long evolution we can neglect the contribution of the pure dephasing and focus on the transition error . in this case the interesting part of the error functional takes the form    @xmath169.\\ ] ]    even if the analysis in this case is much more complicated , it can be seen that @xmath100 has an absolute minimum for @xmath128 .",
    "the long time behavior is the same ( @xmath170 ) such that the results are qualitatively analogous to the above ones : for small @xmath110 loops ( or long evolution at fixed velocity ) the holonomic quantum gate presents a decreasing error . then even in this case",
    "it is possible to minimize the environmental error .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the performance of holonomic quantum gates in the presence of environmental noise by focusing on the possibility to have small errors choosing different loops in the parameter manifold . due to the geometric dependence",
    ", we can implement the same logical gate with different loops .",
    "since different loops correspond to different dynamical evolutions , we have used this freedom to construct an evolution through `` protected '' or `` weakly influenced '' states leading to good holonomic quantum gates performances .",
    "this allows to select ( once that the physical parameter are fixed ) the best loop which minimizes the environmental effect .",
    "( note that this optimization procedure is rather independent of the details of the simple model we have considered and arguably , it could be extended to more complicated systems without any substantial modification . )",
    "we have shown that for long time evolutions the noise decreases as @xmath171 while in the other cases it increases linearly with adiabatic time .",
    "we also have shown that the same features can be found with different kinds of noise suggesting the possibility to find a way to minimize the environmental effect in the presence of any noise .",
    "these results open a new possibility for implementation of holonomic quantum gates to build quantum computation because they seem robust against both control error and environmental noise .",

    "<S> we show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser . for a simplified , albeit realistic model </S>",
    "<S> , we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate ( properly estimated in terms of average fidelity ) increases . on the basis of this result </S>",
    "<S> , we compare holonomic gates with the so - called stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) gates . </S>"
