    "light propagation in disordered media has been a topic of intense studies for nearly three decades @xcite . in analogy to electronic transport in disordered metals , fundamental issues related to diffusion and localization have been addressed @xcite .",
    "one interesting example is the long - range intensity correlations@xcite , which characterize the mesoscopic transport of both classical and quantum waves , and reflect the closeness to the anderson localization threshold @xcite . experimentally correlations in time , space , frequency , angle , and polarization have been investigated , but most measurements are performed on transmitted or reflected light outside the random media @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to probe correlations inside the random media and monitor how long - range correlations build up as light propagates through the random media .",
    "however , it is very difficult to probe transport inside three - dimensional ( 3d ) random media . only in the microwave experiment ,",
    "a detector ( antenna ) has been inserted into the random media to measure the intensity inside@xcite .",
    "alternatively we design and fabricate quasi-2d disordered waveguides to probe light transport inside from the third dimension @xcite .",
    "this approach will allow us to directly measure the intensity correlations and fluctuations inside the random structures .",
    "furthermore , we vary the degree of long - range intensity correlations by changing the waveguide geometry .",
    "the intensity - intensity correlation function @xmath0 consists of three terms , a short - range @xmath1 , a long - range @xmath2 and an infinite - range @xmath3 .",
    "intuitively interferences between waves scattered along independent paths give rise to @xmath1 , one crossing of paths generates @xmath2 , and two crossings cause @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the spatial correlation @xmath1 decays exponentially with increasing distance and vanishes beyond the transport mean free path @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2 also decays but much more slowly , while @xmath3 has a constant contribution .",
    "the long - range correlation leads to a fluctuation of total transmission @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the transmission from an incoming wave mode @xmath7 to an outgoing mode @xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 is on the order of @xmath9 , and @xmath3 of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the conductance @xcite . when @xmath12 , @xmath0 is dominated by @xmath1 .",
    "to measure @xmath2 , the spatial distance must exceed the transport mean free path so that @xmath1 dies out .",
    "alternatively , @xmath2 can be measured by collecting all transmitted light using an integrating sphere .",
    "this method , however , can not be adopted for the measurement of @xmath2 _ inside _ the sample .",
    "instead , we integrate light intensity over the waveguide cross - section to average out the short - range fluctuation , and directly measure the long - range correlation inside the disordered _",
    "planar waveguide_. the conductance of the waveguide is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of propagating modes in the waveguide .",
    "@xmath15 is the waveguide length , @xmath16 is the waveguide width , @xmath17 is the light wavelength in vacuum , and @xmath18 is the effective index of refraction of the random medium .",
    "hence , by decreasing @xmath16 , we are able to reduce @xmath19 and enhance the magnitude of @xmath2 without modifying the structural disorder .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the design and fabrication of 2d disordered waveguides as well as the optical measurement of intensity correlations inside the waveguide .",
    "section iii contains the calculation of long - range correlations inside the disordered waveguides and the formula for the physical quantities that are measured experimentally .",
    "section iv presents the experimental data and comparison to the theory .",
    "finally we conclude in section v.",
    "the 2d disordered waveguides were fabricated in a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) wafer with a 220 nm silicon layer on top of a 3@xmath20 buried oxide [ fig . 1 ] .",
    "the patterns were written by electron beam lithography and etched in an inductively - coupled - plasma ( icp ) reactive - ion - etcher ( rie ) .",
    "each waveguide contained a 2d random array of air holes that scattered light .",
    "the air hole diameters were 100 nm and the average ( center - to - center ) distance of adjacent holes was 390 nm .",
    "the waveguide walls were made of photonic crystals ( triangle lattice of air holes , the lattice constant = 440 nm , the hole radius = 154 nm ) that had complete 2d bandgap for in - plane confinement of light .",
    "however , light was scattered out of plane , and this leakage allowed us to observe light transport inside the disordered waveguide from the vertical direction .",
    "the monochromatic light from a tunable cw laser source ( hp 8168f ) was coupled by an objective lens of numerical aperture ( na ) = 0.4 into the empty waveguide . to ensure efficient confinement inside the waveguide ,",
    "the light was transverse - electric ( te ) polarized ( electric field in the plane of the waveguide ) .",
    "it was subsequently incident onto the random array of air holes inside the waveguide and underwent multiple scattering [ fig .",
    "the near - field optical image of the spatial distribution of light intensity across the structure was taken by collecting light scattered out of plane using a 50@xmath21 objective lens ( na = 0.42 ) and recorded by an ingaas camera ( xeva 1.7 - 320 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution was limited by the na of the objective lens , and estimated to be @xmath22 2 @xmath20 .",
    "figure 2(b ) is a typical near - field image , which exhibits the short - range intensity fluctuations .    , na = 0.42 ) collects the light scattered by the air holes out of the waveguide plane and images onto a camera .",
    "( b ) a near - field optical image of the intensity of scattered light from the disordered waveguide . the wavelength of the probe light is 1510 nm .",
    "the intensity distribution exhibits short - range fluctuations . @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 represent the axial positions of two cross - sections inside the disordered waveguide . ]    from the near - field image [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , the 2d intensity distribution inside the waveguide @xmath25 was extracted .",
    "then @xmath25 was integrated along the cross - section of the waveguide ( @xmath26 direction ) to give the variation along the waveguide axis ( @xmath27 direction ) @xmath28 .",
    "the spatial intensity correlations were then computed from @xmath28 as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents an ensemble average .",
    "@xmath31 was measured for various combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 inside the disordered waveguides .",
    "the ensemble averaging was done over ten random configurations of air holes and 25 input wavelengths equally spaced between 1500 nm and 1510 nm .",
    "the wavelength spacing was chosen to produce different intensity distributions .",
    "further averaging was done by generating different intensity distributions by slightly moving the input coupling spot along the transverse direction @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , since long range correlations depend on the size and shape of the input beam @xcite , we ensured that the random array of air holes was illuminated uniformly along the @xmath26 direction , so that diffusion occurs only along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "the relevant parameters for light propagation in the disordered waveguide are the transport mean free path @xmath4 and the diffusive dissipation length @xmath32 .",
    "the transport mean free path @xmath4 depends on the size and density of the air holes .",
    "the dissipation mostly comes from out - of - plane scattering as the silicon absorption at the probe wavelength is negligible . as shown in our previous work@xcite , this vertical leakage of light can be treated similarly as absorption and described by the diffusive dissipation length @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ballistic absorption time and @xmath35 is the diffusion coefficient for the disordered waveguides in fig . 1 , we found @xmath36 @xmath37 m and @xmath38 @xmath37 m by fitting the measured @xmath28 with the diffusion equation .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the waveguide length is 80 @xmath37 m , and the width varies from 10 @xmath37 m to 60 @xmath37 m .",
    "thus the conductance @xmath19 is between 1.6 and 9.9 .",
    "spatial intensity correlations defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_definition ] ) involve intensities integrated over the cross - section of the waveguide .",
    "such integration suppresses the contribution from the short - range correlation @xmath1 so that only @xmath2 and @xmath3 remain . at the output end of the disordered waveguide ( @xmath39 ) , these two contributions reduce to the normalized variance of total transmission and the normalized variance of conductance respectively @xcite . @xmath2 and @xmath3 in lossy systems , such as those in our experiment , have been investigated before@xcite . although the expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in ref.@xcite have been derived for diffusive samples ( @xmath40 ) , it has been shown to also apply to the localized samples ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "for the disordered waveguides in our experiment , @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "thus we ignore @xmath3 and assume @xmath42 .",
