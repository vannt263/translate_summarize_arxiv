    "the simplest polyatomic molecules , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , have been intensively studied during the last decades .",
    "interest in these molecules is motivated by the fact that the h@xmath1 ion plays an important role in the chain of chemical reactions in interstellar space , acting as protonator in chemical reactions with almost all atoms .",
    "in particular , dissociation recombination ( dr ) of h@xmath1 with an electron leads via several intermediate steps to the production of water in interstellar space .",
    "many successful models in interstellar chemistry are based on h@xmath1 dr .",
    "in addition , h@xmath1 attracts theorists as a benchmark for high accuracy calculations with small molecules : theoretical _ ab initio _ methods can be tested against existing experimental h@xmath1 spectroscopy data .",
    "the interest in the neutral h@xmath0 molecule is closely related to the problem of h@xmath1 dr .",
    "but h@xmath0 also presents great interest from another point of view .",
    "experimental studies @xcite of the metastable h@xmath0 molecule and several later theoretical studies @xcite revealed non - born - oppenheimer effects of coupling between its electronic , vibrational , and rotational degrees of freedom . as was shown recently @xcite , these non - born - oppenheimer effects play an important role in h@xmath1 dr as well .",
    "the present study is devoted to a theoretical treatment of h@xmath0 photoionization .",
    "there are three main reasons for this study .",
    "the first one is to explore a new theoretical method for the treatment of polyatomic photoionization .",
    "our method is based on multi - channel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) @xcite , the adiabatic hyperspherical approach to vibrational dynamics of three nuclei , the formalism of outgoing wave siegert states @xcite , and inclusion of a non - born - oppenheimer coupling  jahn - teller effect .",
    "the second reason is related to a recent study of h@xmath1 dr @xcite , where the reported method was very successful in treatment of h@xmath1 dr , giving good agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results from storage rings @xcite .",
    "however , since that method is new , it is desirable to test it in greater detail .",
    "an application to the interpretation of h@xmath0 photoionization experiments @xcite is such a test .",
    "these photoionization experiments were successfully interpreted in previous theoretical work @xcite , where another method based on mqdt was applied .",
    "thus , the present treatment can also be tested against the previous theoretical studies .",
    "our treatment of photoionization is similar to the one developed by stephens and greene @xcite , and employed in refs .",
    "@xcite for interpretation of two photoionization experiments by bordas _",
    "_ @xcite and by mistrk _",
    "both experiments were interpreted using a full rovibronic frame transformation @xcite .",
    "the present treatment has several differences from the one proposed by stephens and greene .",
    "the first difference is the use of the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation @xcite for the representation of vibrational wave functions .",
    "stephens and greene used the exact three - dimensional vibrational wave functions .",
    "the second difference is the correction of the incompatibility between the form for the reaction matrices used in refs . @xcite and the quantum defect parameters of jahn - teller coupling used in the mentioned studies .",
    "in fact , the values of jahn - teller quantum defect parameters used in refs . @xcite are compatible with an alternative form of the reaction matrix , which was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we use the same form of @xmath2-matrix as in refs . @xcite and quantum defect parameters from ref . @xcite .",
    "thus , jahn - teller parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 from @xcite should be multiplied by @xmath5 to be used in the present study .",
    "the third difference is in the symmetrization of the total rovibrational wave functions of the h@xmath1 ion . in refs . @xcite the symmetrization is made according to the procedure proposed by spirko and jensen @xcite :",
    "rotational and vibrational parts of the total wave function are symmetrized separately and in two - step procedure . in the present treatment",
    "we symmetrize the total wave function only once at the very final step .",
    "this greatly simplifies the construction of wave functions of a required symmetry .",
    "the fourth difference is in calculation of dipole transition moments . calculating the dipole moment into a final state",
    ", stephens and greene accounted only for the diagonal component of the final state wave function .",
    "our treatment accounts for all non - diagonal wave function components contributing to the dipole transition element .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : tot_wf ] describes construction of the total wave function of h@xmath1 and compares our method of the construction with the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : s ] , we build up the scattering matrix that represents the collision between an electron and an ion . section [ sec : oscil_strength ] presents a derivation of dipole transition moments and oscillator strengths for h@xmath0 .",
    "we discuss results of our calculation and compare those results with experimental data in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation_of_spectr ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] states our conclusions .",
    "atomic units are used in the article unless otherwise stated .",
    "in this study we consider only @xmath6-wave scattering ( or half - scattering ) of the electron from the molecule . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , higher electronic partial waves make much smaller contribution than the @xmath6-wave to the photoionization spectrum .",
    "similar to our study of h@xmath1 dissociative recombination , we chose the molecular axis @xmath7 along the main symmetry axis of the molecule .",
    "directions of two other axes , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are shown in fig .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the total wave function @xmath10 of the ion can be represented as a sum of terms , each of which is product of three factors @xcite : @xmath11 in the above equation , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are three euler angles defining the orientation of the molecular fixed axis with respect to the space fixed coordinates system .",
    "below , we describe briefly the construction of all three factors in the product of eq .",

    "the rotational part @xmath14 of the total wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi_total ] ) is the symmetric top wave function for h@xmath1 , which is proportional to the wigner function @xcite .",

    "the transformation properties of the symmetric top wave function under the @xmath19 group , are given in table ii of ref .",

    "@xmath20 is a subgroup of @xmath19 : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the operation of reflection with respect to the plane of three nuclei . for our discussion of the vibrational symmetry of h@xmath1 , it is convenient to use normal coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( for definitions , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . @xmath23 describes the symmetric stretch mode .",
    "the motion along this coordinate is characterized by the ( approximate ) quantum number @xmath26 and by the corresponding frequency @xmath27 .",
    "normal coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to two vibrational modes having the same frequency of oscillations @xmath28 .",
    "vibrations along @xmath24 and @xmath25 are characterized by the approximate numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 , correspondingly .",
    "the total vibrational energy can be approximated @xmath31 .",
    "( the vibrational quantum numbers @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the corresponding energy @xmath32 are not exact as long as the ionic molecular potential is not exactly harmonic . ) due to the degeneracy of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes , the two - dimensional vibrational motion along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 coordinates can be equivalently represented in polar vibrational coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , instead of quantum numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it is convenient to define @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is associated with the motion along @xmath34 coordinate : vibrational angular motion around the symmetry axis . thus , the vibrational energy is determined only by the quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath37 : @xmath38 .",
    "the number @xmath37 shows how many vibrational quanta are in the asymmetric mode .",
    "the number @xmath36 determines how many of the asymmetric quanta @xmath37 contribute to the vibrational angular momentum , @xmath39 . in reality , due to the anharmonicity of potentials , the vibrational energy of states with same @xmath26 and @xmath37 but different @xmath36 are slightly different .",
    "however , pairs of states with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( here and below , @xmath42 is any integer number ) , are strictly degenerate .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath19 symmetry group has doubly degenerate representations .",
    "thus , vibrational wave functions , @xmath43 of the ion are specified by the triad of quantum numbers @xmath44 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath36 can have values @xmath45 and it controls the symmetry of the vibrational wave functions .",
    "states with @xmath46 , with an integer @xmath47 , can be of @xmath48 or @xmath49 symmetry . in order to distinguish the two symmetries using the number @xmath36",
    ", we will label states @xmath48 with positive @xmath36 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 states with negative @xmath36 .",
    "a pair of states with @xmath51 having both signs of @xmath36 constitutes the degenerate pair of functions , that transform according to the @xmath32 representation .",
    "in contrast to the numbers @xmath44 , the classifications with symmetry labels @xmath48 , @xmath49 , or @xmath32 are exact .    in the present treatment",
    "the relative phase of degenerate states @xmath52 with @xmath41 is slightly different from the one used in ref .",
    "transformations of @xmath52 with the present choice of phases are summarized in table iii of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the third factor of the total ionic wave function is the nuclear spin wave function .",
    "the nuclear spin states are classified according to the total spin @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "these states are constructed as described in ref .",
    "the result is @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 wave functions , transformed according to the @xmath58 representation of the respective symmetry group @xmath59 of three identical particle permutations .",
    "the state @xmath60 transforms according to the @xmath48 representation ; the states @xmath56 and @xmath61 transform according to the @xmath32 representation .",
    "the transformation of the total wave function @xmath10 is determined by the quantum numbers @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the final step in the construction of the total wave function is an appropriate symmetrization of @xmath10 . since the total wave function should be antisymmetric with respect to ( 12 )",
    "we determine @xmath64 : @xmath65 in the above equation @xmath66 for all vibrational states excluding @xmath49 , for which @xmath67 ; @xmath68 if @xmath69 , and @xmath70 if @xmath71 . the condition for antisymmetry with respect to ( 12 ) is specified explicitly . if the symmetrization is trivial , i.e. both terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_tot_wf ] ) are identical , then the wave function is @xmath72 it is only possible if @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath70 .",
    "the fermionic nature of nuclei also requires that the wave function @xmath64 should be antisymmetric with respect to operations of ( 13 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "it is only possible if @xmath64 transforms according to the @xmath75 or @xmath76 representations of the @xmath77 group .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 .",
    "the determination of the total symmetry has one exception from the above rule .",
    "namely , when the symmetrization is trivial : @xmath80 .",
    "for this case , the rovibrational part of the product ( [ eq : final_tot_wf_triv ] ) has @xmath48 or @xmath49 symmetry , thus , @xmath63 can only be 0 .",
    "finally , the overall parity of the total state , which is determined as transformational under the operation of total inversion @xmath81 , is determined by the number @xmath16 : the parity is even if @xmath16 is even and the parity is odd if @xmath16 is odd .    in this study",
    "we are primarily interested in the ortho - modification of the h@xmath0 molecule of @xmath75 symmetry .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq : final_tot_wf ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath82 or , when @xmath74 and @xmath70 , to @xmath83    only states with @xmath84 and with even @xmath16 are allowed .",
    "again there is an exception , when the symmetrization is trivial : when @xmath74 and @xmath15 is even ( rotational symmetry is @xmath85 ) , @xmath46 can only be negative ( @xmath49 vibrational symmetry ) ; when @xmath74 and @xmath15 is odd , @xmath46 must be positive or zero .      as in our study of h@xmath1 dissociative recombination @xcite",
    ", we employ the adiabatic hyperspherical approach to describe the vibrational dynamics of h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 in three dimensions . in this approach , three hyperspherical coordinates , the hyper - radius @xmath86 and two hyperangles @xmath87 , @xmath88 , represent three vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite . in our calculations",

    "the hyperspherical coordinates are similar to the normal coordinates of h@xmath1 @xcite , where all operations from @xmath20 involve the polar angle @xmath34 uniquely .",
    "for example , the effect of the @xmath89 operation is a cyclic permutation of the three internuclear distances . in the hyperspherical coordinates ,",
    "it is realized by adding the angle @xmath90 to @xmath88 as determined in eqs .",

    "these symmetry properties of the hyperspherical vibrational coordinates simplify our treatment appreciably .    in the adiabatic hyperspherical method we first solve the vibrational schrdinger equation at a fixed hyper - radius @xmath86 @xcite , obtaining a set of energies @xmath100 and corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath101 .",
    "changing @xmath86 , we obtain a set of adiabatic potential curves @xmath102 and adiabatic hyperspherical eigenstates @xmath103 .",
    "as mentioned above , each element from the @xmath20 symmetry group is represented by a corresponding transformation involving only the hyperangle @xmath88 .",

    "<S> we have developed a theoretical method for interpretation of photoionization experiments with the h@xmath0 molecule . in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we give a detailed description of the method , which combines multichannel quantum defect theory , the adiabatic hyperspherical approach , and the techniques of outgoing siegert pseudostates . </S>",
    "<S> the present method accounts for vibrational and rotation excitations of the molecule , deals with all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule , including vibrational , rotational , electronic and nuclear spin symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the method was recently applied to treat dissociative recombination of the h@xmath1 ion . </S>",
    "<S> since h@xmath1 dissociative recombination has been a controversial problem , the present study also allows us to test the method on the process of photoionization , which is understood better than dissociative recombination . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with two photoionization experiments is obtained . </S>"
