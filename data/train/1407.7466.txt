    "the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials with strong exchange interaction between atomic magnetic moments is well described by the phenomenological landau - lifshitz ( ll ) or landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation.@xcite although the damping term in the llg equation is physically more relevant than the corresponding term in the ll equation,@xcite these equations are mathematically equivalent and equally efficient . according to them , the local magnetization undergoes damped precessional motion about the local effective magnetic field , which usually includes the exchange and anisotropy fields , the externally applied magnetic field and the magnetostatic field .",
    "except in the simplest cases ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] and references therein ) , the llg equation ( because of the equivalence of the ll and llg equations , we refer only to the llg one ) can not be solved exactly . moreover , since the magnetostatic field depends on the magnetization distribution , the llg equation must be solved together with the magnetostatic maxwell equations , i.e. , the llg equation is in general not closed . in metallic materials ,",
    "the effective field includes also the magnetic field of eddy currents that are induced by changing in time the external magnetic field and the magnetization direction . as a consequence",
    ", the llg equation must be supplemented by the full system of maxwell s equations .",
    "this coupled system of the llg and maxwell equations can be solved numerically using , e.g. , advanced methods discussed in refs .",
    "it is well known@xcite that if the ferromagnetic particles are sufficiently small ( with the particles size of the order of @xmath0 nanometers or less ) then the uniform magnetization is energetically preferable .",
    "these nanoparticles exhibit unique properties and have many current and potential applications , e.g. , in data storage,@xcite spintronics@xcite and biomedicine.@xcite if , in addition , the nanoparticles are ellipsoidal , when the internal magnetostatic field is strictly uniform,@xcite or if in non - ellipsoidal nanoparticles this field is assumed to be uniform and known , then the llg equation becomes closed .",
    "this equation , which due to the uniform magnetization reduces to the first order vector differential equation , is a valuable tool for studying the magnetization dynamics in dielectric nanostructures . in particular ,",
    "it was used to study the periodic and quasiperiodic regimes of the magnetization precession,@xcite chaotic magnetization dynamics,@xcite precessional magnetization switching,@xcite thermal@xcite and many other effects .",
    "in conducting nanostructures the llg equation becomes unclosed because of the presence of the magnetic field of eddy currents .",
    "stimulated by potential applications , the temporal evolution of the ( non - uniform ) magnetization and eddy currents in some nanostructures has been studied by numerically solving the coupled system of the llg and maxwell equations . in particular , this approach was used to analyze the process of magnetization reversal in metallic nanocubes.@xcite it was shown that , similarly to the case of domain walls moving in metallic ferromagnets , eddy currents act on the reversal process as an additional damping parameter in the llg equation . arising from faraday s law of induction , this result seems to be quite general . however , even in the simplest case of a uniformly magnetized spherical nanoparticle , considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , the problem of reducing the coupled system of the llg and maxwell equations to the closed llg equation has not been solved completely . in particular",
    ", the authors determined the magnetic field of eddy currents only in the nanoparticle centre and used it to find the contribution of eddy currents to the damping parameter .",
    "but because the current - induced magnetic field inside the nanoparticle is strongly non - uniform , this contribution differs significantly from the exact one ( see below ) .    in this paper",

    "<S> we develop an analytical model for describing the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic metal nanoparticles , which is based on the coupled system of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) and maxwell equations . by solving maxwell s equations in the quasi - static approximation and finding the magnetic field of eddy currents , we derive the closed llg equation for the magnetization that fully accounts for the effects of conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the difference between the llg equations in metallic and dielectric nanoparticles and show that these effects can strongly influence the magnetization dynamics . as an example illustrating the importance of eddy currents , the phenomenon of precessional switching of magnetization is considered . </S>"
