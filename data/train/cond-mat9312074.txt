    "the soccer - ball shaped molecule c@xmath6 ( buckminsterfullerene ) and its various crystalline compounds have ignited enormous interest in the chemistry and physics community in past two years @xcite .",

    "the charged molecule is fundamentally interesting , because the high molecular symmetry gives rise to degeneracies in both electronic and vibrational systems .",
    "thus , the molecule is very sensitive to perturbations .",
    "in particular , electron  phonon and electron  electron interactions are expected to produce highly correlated ground states and excitations .",
    "superconductivity has been discovered in alkali doped buckminsterfullerenes a@xmath7c@xmath6 ( a = k , cs , rb ) , with relatively high transition temperatures ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "there are experimental indications that the pairing mechanism originates in the electronic properties of a single molecule .",
    "the pair binding energy is a balance of electron - vibron interactions @xcite and electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "the relative contributions and signs of the two interactions is under some controversy .    the electron  vibron school has identified certain five - fold degenerate @xmath2 ( d - wave like ) vibrational modes which couple strongly to the @xmath3 lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) @xcite .",
    "varma , zaanen and raghavachari @xcite as well as schluter _ et al _ and , more recently , antropov _ et al _ proposed that these modes undergo a jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion and calculated the induced pair binding energies at several fillings .",
    "they used the _ classical approximation _ , and restricted their calculation to unimodal distortions ( defined later ) .",
    "the general conclusion of this approach is that , while the calculated @xmath10 is sizeable , one still requires a large reduction of the coulomb pseudo ",
    "potential @xmath11 in order to explain the highest transition temperatures .",
    "on the other hand , gunnarsson _",
    "et al _ independently estimate a large @xmath12 , i.e. there is no mechanism providing such a reduction .",
    "however , estimates of the electron  vibron coupling constant @xmath13 do not justify the classical jt approximation .",
    "c@xmath6 is estimated by frozen phonon calculations to be in the weak coupling regime @xmath14 where quantum corrections are important .",
    "in this paper ( part i ) we study the isolated c@xmath15 charged molecule .",
    "in particular , we shall reconsider the same jt model , but diagonalize the quantum hamiltonian for the full range of the coupling constant .",
    "we shall find that quantum corrections to the classical jt theory introduce novel qualitative features , and are quantitatively important for the pair binding energies .",
    "the quantum fluctuations involve interference effects due to geometrical berry phases .",
    "berry phases appear in a wide host of physical phenomena @xcite . here",
    "we find it in the context of a `` molecular aharonov - bohm ( mab ) effect '' , originally discovered by longuet - higgins @xcite .",
    "the mab effect has important consequences on the vibron spectrum .",
    "for example , it produces half  odd integer quantum numbers in the spectrum of triangular molecules @xcite , an effect recently confirmed spectroscopically in na@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this kind of berry phase is important also in scattering of hydrogen molecules @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that a geometrical berry phase may be relevant in fullerene ions @xcite .",
    "here we show that berry phases produce _ selection rules _ for the pseudo  rotational quantum numbers and _ kinematical _ restrictions which effect the pairing interaction between electrons .",
    "although the semiclassical and berry phase description is appropriate in strong coupling , the level ordering and degeneracies are found to survive for arbitrary coupling , particularly in the weak coupling regime , which is closer to actual c@xmath6 .",
    "for this reason we devote a large portion of this paper to the semiclassical theory , which helps to build physical intuition for further extensions of the model .",

    "the @xmath147 multiplet , has 15 two - electron states .",
    "the spin singlet subspace constitutes of a 6-fold degenerate multiplet that splits into an orbital s and a d multiplet . as the semiclassical eq .",
    "( [ 4.16 ] ) suggests , the ground state and lowest excitations in the strong coupling limit have orbital degeneracies of _ even _ angular momenta .",
    "in fact , the lowest two among these states ( @xmath76 = 0 , 2 ) both come from the @xmath135=0 multiplet , in contrast with the one electron case . the next pseudorotational level ( @xmath148 ) originates in the @xmath149-fold degenerate @xmath136 , spin singlet multiplet .",
    "actually , at weak coupling it starts out being second in the ordering ( @xmath76= 2 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 ) , but already at very small @xmath13 it crosses the lower l=2 partner and approaches the pseudo  rotational asymptotic level . the convergence with increasing cutoff @xmath118 is worse than in the @xmath4=1 case , which can be as due to larger jt distortions associated with two electrons .",
    "the spin triplet ( @xmath106=1 ) states of @xmath4=2 have not been plotted , as they behave in exactly the same fashion as the @xmath4=1 states ( see fig .",
    "[ exacts1 ] ) .",
    "this figure can be read in terms of @xmath4=2 @xmath106=1 states simply by replacing the spin multiplicity label 2 , as was in the case @xmath4=1 , with 3 . by comparison of fig .",
    "[ exacts2 ] and fig .",
    "[ exacts1 ] we notice that the low - spin @xmath150p state of @xmath135=1 is exactly degenerate with the high - spin @xmath113d state in the same multiplet .",
    "this degeneracy seems accidental .      for three electrons ,",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ exacts3 ] .",
    "the 8-fold degenerate @xmath147 multiplet splits into two states characterized by degeneracies 3 and 5 ( @xmath152p and @xmath152d ) .",
    "the ground state has the correct symmetry for an @xmath76=1 , @xmath153=0 state , which is predicted to be the ground state in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we also expect the lowest excitations to be classified as @xmath76=3 ,  @xmath153=2 ( 14-fold degenerate ) , and @xmath76=3 ,  @xmath153=0 ( 7-fold degenerate ) .",
    "in fact , three levels from the @xmath136 multiplet move down toward the ground state for increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the one which moves lowest is 9-fold ( @xmath152 g ) . in the @xmath154 limit",
    ", it must therefore merge with the 5-fold levels from the @xmath135=0 multiplet to produce the expected @xmath76=3 ,  @xmath153=2 pseudo  rotator excitation .",
    "the next excitation of @xmath76=3 ,  @xmath153=0 state can be identified as an asymptotic limit of the @xmath152f 7-fold degenerate state seen in fig .",
    "[ exacts3 ] .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath151 case is the presence in the @xmath136 multiplet of a state ( the @xmath152s ) whose energy is independent of @xmath13 !",
    "this state is degenerate with the @xmath106=3/2 state @xmath155d which has no jt distortion .",
    "the _ pair energy _ for an average filling of @xmath4 electrons is defined as u_n= e_n+1+e_n-1 -2e_n  , [ 5.1 ] where @xmath156 are the fully relaxed ground state energies of @xmath4 electrons .",
    "formally , @xmath105 is the real part of the two  electron vertex function at zero frequency .",
    "if this energy is negative for odd values of @xmath4 , it means that electrons will have lower total energy if they separate into @xmath157 and @xmath158 occupations of different molecules , rather than occupying @xmath4 electrons on all molecules . for odd values of @xmath4 , this is an effective pairing interaction often called `` pair binding '' in the literature @xcite . in section [ semiclas ]",
    "we found that for all odd @xmath4 , the pair energies are negative , and given by the large @xmath13 asymptotic expression u_n=1,3,5  ~- g^2 + 1 - 23 g^2  + o(g^-4 ) . [ 5.2 ] the first term is the _ classical energy_. the second term is due to reduction of zero point energy along the jt manifold , since only radial modes remain hard .",
    "this term is independent of @xmath13 and positive .",
    "the last term is due to the quantum pseudo  rotator hamiltonian , and the berry phases which impose a finite ground state energy associated with odd @xmath76 for odd numbers of electrons .",
    "this term , although nominally small at large @xmath13 , becomes important at weaker coupling . if ( [ 5.2 ] ) is extrapolated to the weak coupling regime the last term would dominate the pair binding energy . the exact diagonalization shown in figure [ exactu ] , indeed shows a significant enhancement of the pair binding energy over the classical value in the weak coupling regime .    in the weak coupling limit ,",
    "we can obtain analytical expressions for @xmath159 for @xmath160 by second order perturbation theory .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is the non interacting part @xmath161 with eigenstates ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "the perturbing hamiltonian is @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) , which connects fock states differing by one vibron occupation .",
    "all diagonal matrix elements vanish , and the leading order corrections to any degenerate multiplet are of order @xmath138 .",
    "these are given by diagonalization of the matrix @xcite , ^(2)_n_ms , n_ms= 0 , n_ms | h^e - v 1 h^e - v | 0,n_ms , [ 5.3 ]    in the degenerate 0-vibrons subspace .",
    "the sum implied by the inverse operator @xmath162 extends just to the @xmath135=1 states .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath163 yield the ground state energies and splittings for different electron fillings .",
    "these results , for all @xmath2 and also @xmath18 modes , and extended to the @xmath135=1 multiplet , will be discussed more extensively in @xcite .    here",
    "we refer only to ground state energetics .",
    "in particular , using the perturbative expressions , we obtain , for a single @xmath2 , mode the small @xmath13 pair binding energy  = -52 g^2  + o(g^4 ) . [",
    "5.6 ] the dependence strictly on powers of @xmath138 alone , with absence of all odd powers , is a consequence of the already mentioned @xmath164 selection rule of eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "the origin of the 5/2 factor that characterizes the perturbative result ( [ 5.6 ] ) with respect to the classical pair binding energy ( table i ) will be discussed in ref .",
    ".    the molecular pair binding energy can be considered as an effective negative - u hubbard interaction for the lattice problem , provided that the fermi energy @xmath165 is not much larger than the jt frequency scale @xmath166 . a mean field estimate of the transition temperature for the negative-@xmath105 hubbard model in the weak coupling regime is @xcite t_c _ f .",
    "[ 5.7 ] in refs . @xcite and @xcite , the results of migdal ",
    "eliashberg approximation for the superconducting transition temperature was given . without the coulomb pseudopotentials",
    "this approach yields t_c & & + v&=&-56 g^2   . [ 5.8 ] by comparing ( [ 5.6 ] ) to ( [ 5.8 ] ) we find a striking discrepancy between the values of the effective pairing interaction : u  =3 v .",
    "that is to say : in the weak coupling regime , the correct molecular calculation yields a pairing interaction which is _ three times larger _ than the results of migdal  eliashberg theory .",
    "in this paper , we have solved the problem of a single @xmath2 vibron coupled to @xmath3 electrons in a c@xmath15 molecule .",
    "the model is too simplified for quantitative predictions for c@xmath6 , but it contains interesting novel physics which will be important for further studies of this system .",

    "the molecule distorts unimodally , giving rise to a pseudo - angular momentum spectrum , plus three harmonic oscillators . for @xmath167",
    ", there is a bimodal distortion , which generates a spectrum of a symmetric top rotator , plus two harmonic oscillators .",
    "the pseudo rotations are subject to non trivial berry phase effects , which determine the pseudo - angular momenta @xmath76 , and thus the degeneracies and level ordering of the low lying states .",
    "strong berry phase effects seem to survive even at moderate and weak coupling as shown by the exact diagonalization results .",
    "we find at weak coupling that the pair binding energy is a factor of @xmath5 larger than the classical jt effect , and a factor of three larger than the pairing interaction of migdal  eliashberg theory of superconductivity .",
    "this enhancement can be interpreted semiclassically as due to large zero point energy reduction of the pseudo  rotations . from the weak coupling point of view , this effect is due to degeneracies in both electronic and vibronic systems .",
    "migdal s approximation neglects vertex corrections in the resummation of two  particle ladder diagrams .",
    "this is justified only in the retarded limit @xmath168 .",
    "here we have considered the opposite limit , where the molecular ground state energies are solved first , assuming that the jt relaxation time is of the same order , or faster than the inter molecular hopping time . in this regime , we have found therefore that migdal s approximation substantially _ underestimates _ the pairing interaction , and @xmath169 , for these ideal molecular solids @xcite .",
    "this large effect suggests that some of the enhancement is likely to carry over to the real case of a@xmath7c@xmath6 metals , where electron hopping @xmath170 and vibron frequencies are of similar strength .    in part",
