    "( finiteness theorem ) here one has to give conditions , called ellipticity conditions , under which the operators under consideration are fredholm in relevant function spaces ; 2 .",
    "( index theorem ) here one presents and proves an index formula , that is , an expression for the index of an elliptic operator in terms of topological invariants of the symbol of the operator and the manifold , on which the operator is defined .",
    "the first index theorem on higher - dimensional manifolds was the celebrated atiyah ",
    "singer theorem @xcite on the index of elliptic pseudodifferential operators ( @xmath0do ) on a closed smooth manifold .",
    "this theorem appeared as an answer to a question posed by gelfand  @xcite .",
    "note that the statement and the proof of the index formula relied on most up to date methods of analysis and topology and stimulated interactions between them .",
    "after that index theorems were obtained for many other classes of operators . in this paper we consider the class of operators associated with diffeomorphisms of closed smooth manifolds .",
    "one of advantages of this theory is that , besides the mentioned interaction of analysis and topology , here an important role is played by the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "elliptic operators for a discrete group of diffeomorphisms ( analytical aspects ) .",
    "* the theory of elliptic operators associated with diffeomorphisms and the corresponding theory of boundary value problems with nonlocal boundary conditions go back to the paper by t.  carleman @xcite , where he considered the problem of finding a holomorphic function in a bounded domain @xmath1 , which satisfies a nonlocal boundary condition , which relates the values of the function at a point @xmath2 of the boundary and at the point @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a smooth mapping of period two : @xmath5 a reduction of this boundary value problem to the boundary does not give usual integral equation as it war the case with the local boundary condition .",
    "rather , it gives an integro - functional equation , which we call _ equation associated with diffeomorphism @xmath6_. this paper motivated the study of a more general class of operators on closed smooth manifolds .",

    ", one can also consider operators acting in sections of vector bundles .",
    "operators will be called _ @xmath9-pseudodifferential operators _ ( @xmath9-@xmath0do ) or simply @xmath9-operators .",
    "such operators were intensively studied ( see the fundamental works of antonevich  @xcite , and also the papers @xcite and the references cited there ) . in particular , and extremely important notion of _ symbol of @xmath9-operator _ was introduced there .",
    "more precisely , two definitions of the symbol of a @xmath9-operator were given .",
    "first , the symbol was defined as a function on the cotangent bundle @xmath14 of the manifold taking values in operators acting on the space @xmath15 of square integrable functions on the group .",
    "second , the symbol was defined as an element of the crossed product  @xcite of the algebra of continuous functions on the cosphere bundle @xmath16 of the manifold and the group @xmath9 .",
    "further , we introduce the ellipticity condition in this situation , which is the requirement of invertibility of the symbol of the operator .",
    "it was proved that the two ellipticity conditions ( they correspond to the two definitions of the symbol ) are equivalent under quite general assumptions .",
    "ellipticity implies fredholm property of the operator in suitable sobolev spaces of type @xmath17 .",
    "let us note here one essential difference between the theory of elliptic @xmath9-@xmath0do and a similar theory of @xmath0do .",
    "namely , examples show ( see  @xcite ) that the ellipticity ( and the fredholm property of operator in the sobolev spaces @xmath17 ) essentially depends on the smoothness exponent @xmath18 .",
    "thus , there arise natural questions on the description of the possible values of @xmath18 , for which a given @xmath9-operator is elliptic and the question about the dependence of the index on @xmath18 .",
    "the answers to these questions are well known in the situation of an isometric action of the group , that is , if the diffeomorphisms preserve a riemannian metric on the manifold . in this case",
    "the symbol and the index do not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "first steps in the study of these questions for nonisometric actions were done in the papers @xcite , where it was shown for the simplest nonisometric diffeomorphism of dilation of spheres that the set of @xmath18 , for which a @xmath9-operator is elliptic , is always an interval and the index ( inside this interval ) does not depend on @xmath18 .    *",
    "2 . index of elliptic operators for a discrete group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "* let us now turn attention to the problem of computing the index of elliptic @xmath9-operators .",

    "@xmath9 of diffeomorphisms . in this case",
    "the index of a @xmath9-operator was expressed in terms of lefschetz numbers of an auxiliary elliptic @xmath0do on @xmath7 . since the lefschetz numbers are expressed by a formula @xcite similar to the atiyah ",
    "singer index formula and , hence , the index problem for a finite group is thus solved .",
    "the index problem for infinite groups turned out to be much more difficult and required application of new methods related with noncommutative geometry of connes  @xcite .",
    "the first advance was done in the celebrated work of connes  @xcite .",

    "an index theorem of connes for such differential - difference operators is naturally formulated in terms of noncommutative geometry .",
    "operators , which are also called operators on the noncommutative torus and @xmath23 is a noncommutative deformation of the algebra of functions on the torus @xmath24 .",
    "] , were used in a mathematical explanation of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "it became clear after the cited papers of connes that noncommutative geometry is not only useful , but also natural in the index problem for @xmath9-operators , and since then noncommutative geometry is used in all the papers on the index of @xmath9-operators , we are aware of . for instance , methods of noncommutative geometry were applied to solve the index problem for deformations of algebras of functions on toric manifolds in @xcite and other papers .",
    "further progress in the solution of the index problem for @xmath9-operators was made in the monograph  @xcite .",
    "namely , an index formula for operators was obtained in the situation , when the action is isometric .",
    "let us note here that this index formula for isometric actions contains all the above mentioned formulas as special cases .",
    "in the situation of a general ( that is , _ nonisometric _ ) action there were no index formulas until recently . there were only partial results .",
    "namely , the index problem for @xmath25-operators ( that is , operators for the group of integers ) was reduced to a similar problem for an elliptic @xmath0do ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first index formula in the nonisometric case was obtained in the paper@xcite for operators associated with dilation diffeomorphism of spheres . the index formula for elliptic operators associated with the group @xmath25",
    "was obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , an index formula for an arbitrary torsion free group acting on the circle was stated in @xcite .",
    "we also mention several interesting examples of elliptic @xmath9-operators .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 preserves some geometric structure on the manifold ( for instance , riemannian metric , complex structure , spin structure , ... ) .",
    "then we can consider an elliptic operator associated with that structure and twist this operator using a @xmath9-projection ( that is an operator of the form , which is a projection : @xmath26 ) or an invertible @xmath9-operator .",
    "this construction produces an elliptic @xmath9-operator . for instance , if @xmath9 acts isometrically , then one can take classical geometric operators ( euler , signature , dolbeault , dirac operators ) .",
    "the indices of the corresponding twisted @xmath9-operators were computed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath9 acts by conformal diffeomorphisms of a riemannian surface , then one can take the @xmath27 operator .",
    "indices of the corresponding twisted operators were computed in @xcite . in the papers",
    "@xcite there are index formulas for the twisted dirac operator for group actions preserving the conformal structure on the manifold .    *",
    "3 . operators associated with compact lie groups .",
    "* let now @xmath9 be a _ compact lie group _ acting on @xmath7 .",
    "consider the class of operators of the form @xmath28 ( cf . ) , where @xmath29 is the haar measure .",
    "such operators related values of functions on submanifolds of @xmath7 of positive dimension .",
    "such operators were considered in @xcite . in these papers",
    "a @xmath9-operator of the form was represented as a pseudodifferential operator acting in sections of infinite - dimensional bundles  @xcite , whose fiber is the space of functions on @xmath9 .",
    "this method goes back to the papers of babbage  @xcite and for a finite group gives a finite system of equations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the obtained operator , which we denote by @xmath30 , is @xmath9-invariant , and its restriction @xmath31 to the subspace of @xmath9-invariant functions is isomorphic to the original operator @xmath32 .",
    "now if @xmath33 is transversally elliptic with respect to the action of @xmath9 , then this implies the fredholm property , that is , the index of the operator @xmath34 is finite .",
    "the index formula and the corresponding topological invariants of the symbol of elliptic @xmath9-operators were computed in the papers cited above .    *",
    "4 . other classes of @xmath9-operators . * operators associated with diffeomorphisms are not exhausted by operators of the form . in this section",
    "we consider other classes of operators appearing in the literature .",
    "boundary value problems similar to carleman s problem , with the boundary condition relating the values of the unknown function at different points on the boundary were considered ( see monograph of antonevich , belousov and lebedev @xcite and the references cited there ) .",
    "finiteness theorems were proved and for the case of finite group actions index theorems were obtained ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand , nonlocal boundary value problems , in which the boundary condition relates the values of a function on the boundary of the domain and on submanifolds , which lie inside the domain",
    "there were considered in @xcite .",
    "we also mention that @xmath9-operators on manifolds with singularities were considered in@xcite .",
    "the symbol was defined and a finiteness theorem was proved .",
    "an important extension of the notion of ( fredholm ) index was obtained in @xcite .",

    "fomenko index @xmath38 is an element of the @xmath39-group of @xmath36 .",
    "also , in the cited paper a definition of pseudodifferential operators over @xmath35-algebras was given and an index theorem was proved .",
    "note , however , that in applications it is sometimes useful to have not only the index but some _ numerical _ invariants .",
    "such invariants can be constructed using the approach of noncommutative geometry by pairing the index with cyclic cocycles over @xmath36 . in the papers @xcite @xmath9-operators over @xmath35-algebras",
    "were defined for isometric actions and the finiteness theorem and the index formula were obtained .    * 5 .",
    "methods used in the theory of @xmath9-operators .",
    "* let us know write a few words about the methods used in obtaining these index formulas .",
    "the first approach , which appears naturally , is to try to adapt the known methods of obtaining index formulas for @xmath0dos in our more general setting of @xmath9-operators .",
    "this approach was successfully applied , for instance , in the book @xcite .",
    "note , however , that using this approach we obtain the proof of the index formula , which is quite nontrivial and relies on serious mathematical results , notions and constructions from noncommutative geometry and algebraic topology .",
    "the second approach uses the idea of uniformization @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to reduce the index problem for a @xmath9-operator to a similar problem for a _ pseudodifferential _ operator on a manifold of a higher dimension .",
    "the index of the latter operator can be found using the celebrated atiyah ",
    "singer formula .",
    "the attractiveness of this approach is based on the fact that this approach is quite elementary and does not require application of complicated mathematical apparatus , which was mentioned above .",
    "this method of _ pseudodifferential uniformization _ enabled to give simple and elegant index formulas .",
    "let us now describe the contents of the remaining sections of the paper .",
    "in section 1 we recall the definitions of symbol and the finiteness theorem for @xmath9-operators associated with actions of discrete groups .",
