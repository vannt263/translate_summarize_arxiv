    "@xmath13 0.5 @xmath14 @xcite lowers the masses to 9@xmath50 @xmath18 .",
    "if instead roxs 42b is 1 @xmath14 old like much of the @xmath19 oph complex , roxs 42bb s mass is @xmath20 6 @xmath18 .    considering these uncertainties , we estimate a mass of 9@xmath17 @xmath18 for roxs 42bb .",
    "we derive consistent ( slightly lower , much higher ) mass estimates if we take the surface gravity and radii of our best - fit models at face value : for log(g ) = 3.6 ( 3.4 , 3.8 ) we derive @xmath51 @xmath20 9.110.4 @xmath18 ( 67.3 @xmath18 , 14.315.8 @xmath18 ) .",
    "our analysis of roxs 42bb s 14 @xmath31 photometry and @xmath4-band spectrum provides strong evidence that its atmosphere is dusty , with an effective temperature of @xmath13 2000 @xmath4 .",
    "roxs 42bb s luminosity of log(l / l@xmath47 ) @xmath13 -3.07 @xmath6 0.07 , when compared to evolutionary models , implies a mass of 612 @xmath18 .",
    "thus , our atmosphere modeling supports earlier , largely empirically - driven arguments from @xcite that roxs 42bb is a sub - deuterium burning , planet - mass object .    despite our success in identifying some acceptably fitting models as determined by a @xmath42 statistic ,",
    "roxs 42bb s atmosphere still presents significant modeling challenges .",
    "in particular , no model yet reproduces both the photometry and the triangular - shaped pseudo - continuum at @xmath4-band peaked at 2.24 @xmath31 .",
    "the primary mismatches between the best - fit burrows models and the spectrum are that the models predict too flat of a spectrum , resulting in an overpredicted flux density at 22.1 @xmath31 and underpredicted flux density over the 2.252.3 @xmath31 region .",
    "as @xmath52 absorption controls the shape of the spectrum at 22.15 @xmath31 and cia @xmath10 controls the slope of the spectrum at @xmath13 2.22.3 @xmath31 , different treatments of these opacity sources may improve fits to the data(k ) index appears to be a much stronger function of gravity than predicted from the saumon and marley models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our explored model parameter space is limited in important ways that may slightly modify the best inferred atmospheric properties .",
    "for instance , as our model fits are only weakly sensitive to gravity , we adopted a narrow range of log(g ) = 3.44 .",
    "best - fit atmosphere models typically required larger radii by 2030% compared to their nominal values , which are tied to the @xcite planet / brown dwarf luminosity evolution models , where the rescaling was smaller for lower gravity .",
    "exploring even lower gravities ( e.g. log(g ) = 3 - 3.2 ) may yield as good or better fits to the data without rescaling any radii and thus may be preferred .",
    "models with non - solar carbon abundances may provide marginally better fits to the photometry and/or spectra of hot , young planet - mass objects @xcite .",
    "these issues should be considered to better constrain roxs 42bb s atmospheric properties , in particular its gravity and chemistry .",
    "finally , incorporating new near - ir spectra may further clarify roxs 42bb s temperature , gravity , and chemistry .",
    "the @xmath52 index at the blue edge of @xmath3 band @xcite provides a gravity insensitive independent check on our @xmath4-band derived spectral type as does the @xmath53 index near @xmath0 band @xcite .",
    "the depth of @xmath54 lines in @xmath0 band spectra of substellar objects is gravity sensitive @xcite and provides another way to compare roxs 42bb s atmosphere with those for other young substellar objects , especially those in taurus and upper scorpius and @xmath3 spectra is beyond the scope of this paper , they did provide some evidence that roxs 42bb s spectrum at @xmath0 and @xmath3 band bears strong resemblance to young planet - mass objects .",
    "our best - fit atmosphere models do appear to reproduce key features of roxs 42bb at these wavelengths : the depth of the @xmath54 lines at @xmath0 , the sharp drop at 1.3 @xmath31 , and the triangular shape of the @xmath3 band spectrum . ] .",
