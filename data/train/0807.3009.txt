    "it seems appropriate to us , on the occasion of the centennial of hermann minkowski s geometrical formulation of special relativity , which he put forward in his celebrated address `` raum und zeit '' delivered on the 21@xmath4 of september 1908 , at the 80@xmath5 assembly of german natural scientists and physicians at cologne @xcite , to pay tribute to this great scientist and mathematician by providing a contribution to the interpretation and further development of his ideas and intuitions in the light of the progress which has been achieved in our understanding of the universe in the last hundred years .",
    "+ special relativity was originally formulated by einstein in the `` annus mirabilis '' 1905 resting on 1 ) _ the principle of relativity _ , stating the equivalence of the class of all inertial observers as regards the description of the laws of nature and on 2 ) _ the principle of constancy of the velocity of light _ which states that electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space with a universal speed @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) which does not depend on the state of motion of its source and of the observer who measures this speed @xcite .",
    "+ strictly speaking einstein s original formulation differs from the above to the extent that he does refer all motions to some particular inertial observer which is assumed conventionally to be `` stationary '' .",
    "however , that this observer does not play any privileged role compared to the other ones is clear from his statement that the introduction of a `` luminiferous aether '' will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an `` absolutely stationary space '' provided with special properties , nor assign a velocity - vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place@xcite .",
    "+ thus , einstein s insight irretrievably shattered the notions of absolute space and absolute time which were deeply rooted in the mind of scientists since the time of newton .",
    "however , it was soon realized after einstein s great breakthrough that the principle of constancy of the velocity of light was not necessary in order to obtain the lorentz transformations .",
    "+ indeed , beginning with a work by ignatowski @xcite , a large amount of literature has since appeared in which the lorentz transformations are deduced solely on the basis of the principle of relativity .",
    "precisely , one assumes the existence of a class of privileged reference frames ( @xmath7 ) for the formulation of the laws of nature ( the inertial frames ) .",
    "then one proves that the set of spacetime transformations @xmath8 connecting the coordinates of any two such frames is the poincar group @xmath9 corresponding to an unspecified invariant speed @xmath0 , together with its limits @xmath10 ( the galilei group @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( the carroll group @xmath13 ) @xcite . among the relevant papers we mention only a few representative ones @xcite .",
    "a common characteristic of all these derivations of the lorentz transformations and , more generally , of the poincar group is that they essentially proceed in two steps .",
    "first , one exploits spacetime homogeneity to prove that the transformations @xmath14 are affine : @xmath15 .",
    "second , one uses the isotropy of space and the assumption of noncompactness of boosts to prove that the set of matrices @xmath16 represents the lorentz group @xmath17 .",
    "it is implicit in the first step of the above procedure , the one leading to affine transformations , that not only one assumes spacetime to be homogeneous , but also that this basic symmetry of the spacetime manifold is carried by the privileged class of observers as well . as clearly stated in @xcite ( where for simplicity two - dimensional transformations",
    "are considered ) : we assume first that spacetime is _ homogeneous _ , in that it has `` everywhere and everytime '' the same properties .",
    "this statement , `` everywhere and everytime '' , means that one has already separated space from time thus selecting a reference frame , which is itself assumed to be homogeneous . and",
    "indeed the author continues : more precisely , the transformation properties of a spatiotemporal interval ( @xmath18 ) depend only on that interval and not on the location of its end points ( in the considered reference frame ) . in other words",
    ", the transformed interval @xmath19 obtained through an inertial transformation _ is independent of its end points_. it is precisely this last property which leads to an affine map .",
    "however , a maximally symmetric manifold with constant non - zero curvature is certainly homogeneous ( think for example of a two - dimensional sphere ) , but no coordinate system on the manifold can itself be homogeneous . indeed , if it were so , the components of the metric tensor relative to such coordinate system would be independent of the point of the manifold , which implies zero curvature .",
    "this indicates that , in searching for the possible structure of the kinematical group of nature reflecting the basic symmetries of spacetime , the principle of relativity itself , at least in its traditional formulation , has to be abandoned : _ the basic spacetime symmetries do not imply the existence of a privileged class of global observers_. + now then , where does minkowski enters this picture ?",
    "though in his cologne address he does not state matters in the form that we have outlined here , _ it was actually he who first abandoned the principle of constancy of the velocity of light_. indeed , his point of departure is the observation that the laws of newtonian mechanics are invariant under two distinct groups of transformations .",
    "the first one , which we denote by @xmath20 , is the one generated by space rotations , space translations and time translations . as such",
    ", it embodies the fundamental symmetries of space and the homogeneity of time .",
    "the second group is the group @xmath21 of boosts , namely the group of those transformations which change the state of motion of the underlying system of spatial coordinates by imparting to it any uniform translationary motion .",
    "minkowski notes that these two groups lead their lives entirely apartand appear to be utterly heterogeneous , the group @xmath21 , in addition , appearing to be somewhat accidental and less fundamental than @xmath20 ( this is for example the attitude taken by lorentz and poincar ) .",
    "however , in minkowski s opinion this separation appears to be artificial and it is his firm belief that in nature the two invariances must be intimately interconnected . the obvious way by which this can be achieved is to abandon the commutativity of boosts by acknowledging that space and time are not separate entities and that boosts do `` rotate '' space and time among themselves in a way analogous to rotations of the space axes . in this way ,",
    "space and time cease to exist as separate absolute entities and give way to a new absolute four - dimensional entity which minkowski calls _ the world _",
    "( spacetime , in modern terminology ) .",
    "then , once we have fixed at will a spacetime point as the origin of the @xmath22-coordinates , the kinematical group of the world stemming from the basic symmetries of boosts and space rotations is the lorentz group @xmath17 ( denoted @xmath23 by minkowski ) which is determined up to the unspecified value of the invariant speed @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is only in the limit @xmath24 that space and time split as separate entities and one recovers , as a degenerate limit , the former two groups @xmath20 and @xmath21 of newtonian mechanics . in this way",
    ", the invariant speed @xmath0 is not introduced in the argument from the outset , as a physical velocity experimentally found in nature .",
    "instead , its existence , as an unspecified dimensional parameter , stems from the principle of relativity and it is only _ a posteriori _ that it can be identified with the physical velocity of propagation of light in empty space , as minkowski remarks .",
    "thus he arrives at the lorentz group ( and , by adding spacetime translations , at the poincar group ) by exploiting the principle of relativity alone .",
    "he interprets this principle as implying , through a leap of audacity on the part of the higher mathematics , that space and time are intimately interconnected in an indivisible four - dimensional continuum ( world ) of events ( the term employed by minkowski is `` substantial points '' ) .",
    "it is in this spirit that he proposes to replace the term `` relativity postulate '' ( the principle of relativity ) with the term `` _ postulate of the absolute world _ '' .",
    "+ however , following dyson @xcite , we are led to observe here that minkowski in his 1908 lecture failed to carry his argument to its logical conclusions .",
    "indeed , the argument that guided minkowski to drop the commutativity of boosts thereby allowing him to interconnect boosts and space rotations into the lorentz group has left spacetime translations out of the picture . on the other hand ,",
    "it is only logical that the same argument should be extended to translations , by dropping their commutativity as well .",
    "indeed , it appears that , even at the beginning of the 20@xmath25 century , astronomers would not have had any a priori compelling reason to believe that the commutativity of translations would not eventually break down provided one would look sufficiently far away in spacetime .",
    "the reason why such a possibility did not occur to scientists then is very likely due to the fact that nobody had yet any clear knowledge at that time of the existence of other galaxies , in the universe , beyond ours .",
    "in fact , it was only through his observations with the 100 inch hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory , carried out during the years 1923 and 1924 , that hubble was able to establish beyond doubt that most of the nebulae , earlier observed with less powerful telescopes and thought to belong to the milky way , were not part of our galaxy , being instead themselves galaxies in their own right , beyond our own . therefore , since the picture one had of the universe at the time of minkowski was that of an island galaxy immersed in an otherwise infinite void , the idea of non commuting space and time translations would have indeed appeared quite unnatural to everybody , minkowski himself included . nevertheless , it is perhaps a bit surprising that no act of audacity on the part of higher mathematics   arose suggesting that translations were not , after all , commutative . in the words of dyson @xcite ,",
    "an opportunity was missed by minkowski and by his fellow mathematicians .",
    "had someone made the further daring leap of renouncing the commutativity of translations , a quite logical step after the commutativity of boosts had been abandoned , and acknowledged that lorentz transformations and spacetime translations should not lead their lives entirely apart   but be instead interconnected , one would have realized that the true kinematical group of nature is not the poincar group @xmath9 but the de sitter group @xmath26 , @xmath1 being an unspecified `` cosmological constant '' to be determined by observation @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath9 would arise as a degenerate limit of @xmath26 as @xmath27 , in the same way as the galilei group @xmath11 is a degenerate limit of @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "had the above step been made one would have discovered theoretically that the universe expands , and that its expansion is accelerated , well before the development of general relativity , hubble s observation of the recession of galaxies , and the observation of the apparent luminosity - red shift relation of distant type ia supernovae ! but an opportunity was missed and , in spite of all what happened in the development of theory and observation in the meanwhile , it took 60 years after minkowski s 1908 address before someone was inspired to tackle in all generality the problem of finding all possible kinematical groups compatible with the basic observational spacetime symmetries of space isotropy , spacetime homogeneity and boost invariance .",
    "this problem was solved in a truly remarkable paper by bacry and lvy - leblond which appeared in 1968 @xcite .",
    "and sure enough the result turned out to be that the most general such group is @xmath26 ( de sitter or anti - de sitter , depending on the sign of @xmath1 ) , depending on a unspecified invariant velocity @xmath0 and a likewise unspecified intrinsic spacetime curvature @xmath28 , together with its possible contractions @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 .",
    "however , the bacry and lvy - leblond paper went largely unnoticed among the community of cosmologists .",
    "the reason for this can be perhaps ascribed to the fact that the paper was written by mathematical physicists and also that the cosmological constant @xmath1 , which einstein had introduced with the purpose of obtaining a static solution of his equations , was dropped after the discovery by hubble that the universe is expanding , only for being seriously re - introduced into the picture at the end of last century , when the observation of the luminosity - redshift relation of distant type ia supernovae strongly indicated that the expansion of the universe is nowadays accelerated ( and has ever been so since approximately the last five billion years ) @xcite .",
    "+ to be sure , even well before the observation of distant supernovae , particle physicists , following an original suggestion by zeldovich @xcite , had considered the possibility of appearance of a non zero cosmological constant as a form of gravitationally repulsive `` vacuum energy density '' arising from the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields describing the known elementary particles .",
    "however , the value of @xmath1 obtained from a heuristic and quite nave estimate of such vacuum energy is 120 orders of magnitude greater than the observed one . therefore , if @xmath1 is quantum mechanical in origin , one is faced with the shameful problem of explaining such preposterous discrepancy .",
    "subtle cancellations should occur and one of the possible applications of supersymmetry is an implementation of such cancellations @xcite .",
    "+ now , what is the present observational situation ?",
    "there are several independent observational and numerical evidences which are all consistent with each other and which indicate that there is an effect , which is gravitationally repulsive and which is responsible for the accelerated expansion .",
    "in addition to the supernovae observations , this hypothesis is independently supported by the observation of ripples in the distribution of galaxies , which match the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma before decoupling , by the apparent size of cold and hot spots in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , by the reworking of the cmb by the gravitational fields of cosmic structures ( the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) , by the study of the growth of galaxy clusters via weak gravitational lensing techniques , and by the observed changes in galaxy population of the universe during the different cosmic epochs ( evolution of galaxy mergers , rate of star formation and galactic metamorphosis @xcite ) .",
    "+ all these observations point to the conclusion that the universe is permeated by some `` exotic '' kind of gravitationally repulsive energy density , universally referred to as `` dark energy '' , which seems to be distributed uniformly in space ( being therefore free of clumping ) which accounts for approximately 75% of the energy content of the universe , the remaining 25% being provided by ordinary matter ( baryonic and dark ) .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath31 of dark energy matches within 10% the value @xmath32 corresponding to its interpretation as a cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , this value of @xmath31 for dark energy does not appear to have varied significantly in the last seven billion years .",
    "+ what is the true nature of dark energy ? regarding this question particle physicists and cosmologists are to date groping in pitch dark .",
    "besides the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant ( possibly quantum mechanical in origin ) there are several alternative hypotheses regarding the nature of the phenomenon . among these : some dynamic field varying in space and time ( quintessence , @xcite ) ; a modification of general relativity operating at large scales @xcite ; the proposal that the observed acceleration of the universe is ascribable to the relativistic backreaction of cosmological perturbations and does not require the presence of some kind of negative pressure fluid @xcite ; that the expansion of the universe is in fact decelerated and that it is just that gravitational effects arising from the highly uneven distribution of matter in the cosmos affect differently the measurements of space and time from place to place and thereby create the illusion of acceleration ( the fractal bubble model , @xcite ) . with so many theories vying to explain dark energy , more data are needed . and ,",
    "indeed , a big effort will be carried out in the coming years in terms of dedicated instrumentation on earth and in space with the purpose of better investigating the nature of dark energy , whether it changes in space and time , whether it is a simple manifestation of the cosmological constant , thus being uniform in space and unchanging in time , or wether it is simply an illusion due to the highly inhomogeneus distribution of matter in the cosmos .",
    "some representatives of such important programs are the baryon oscillation sky survey ( due to start in 2009 ) , the h - e telescope dark energy experiment ( planned to begin observations in 2010 ) , several new generation cosmic - microwave - background experiments , both on the ground and in space ( for example the planck satellite , due for launch this year ) , the large synoptic survey telescope , due to start operation in 2012 , the dark energy space telescope for the study of supernovae and weak lensing ( possibly starting operating in 2014 ) , the advanced dark energy physics telescope , which would study baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae and which may also start operating in 2014 , and the joint dark energy mission which may be launched sometime between 2011 and 2017 .",
    "if we espouse the point of view that dark energy is the cosmological constant , another intriguing aspect of the matter is why its observed value ( of the order of @xmath33 ) is so small and why the corresponding energy density ( of the order of @xmath34 ) is comparable to the energy density of ordinary matter ( the cosmic coincidence conundrum ) .",
    "it was not so in the distant past , when @xmath35 was much larger than @xmath36 , and it will presumably be no more so in the far future from now , when we expect to have @xmath37 ( here , as usual , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote respectively the ratios of the densities of ordinary matter and of dark energy to the critical density ) .",
    "we live during a very special epoch of the history of the universe , an epoch in which @xmath36 and @xmath35 are of the same order of magnitude ! perhaps the only way to explain this coincidence is to resort to some kind of anthropic principle @xcite , though such an explanation is far from being a satisfactory one .",
    "+ quite independently of these problems , on the basis of the analysis displayed in the first part of this introduction , we are inclined to believe , in minkowski s spirit , that @xmath1 _ is a true ( classical ) universal constant _ , just as the limiting speed @xmath0 is . in other words ,",
    "we adopt the point of view of bacry and lvy - leblond , who are motivated in finding the most general kinematical group which is compatible with the seemingly unquestionable fundamental symmetries that nature displays .",
    "precisely , experiments and observations in all realms of physics indicate that the local laws governing natural phenomena do not depend on time and on the location in space ( spacetime homogeneity ) , that no direction in space is privileged compared to any other ( isotropy of space ) , and that the principle of inertia is locally valid ( invariance under boosts ) .",
    "the principle incorporating the combination of these symmetries should then replace the historical principle of relativity and , in minkowski s spirit , be rightly termed _",
    "the principle of the absolute world_. the most general kinematical group compatible with this principle is @xmath26 , and the actual values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 must be determined by observation .",
    "we show that this result follows essentially from spacetime homogeneity and isotropy of space alone , the principle of inertia being actually a consequence of these properties . ] and , sure enough , it turns out that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have well defined nonzero finite values ( in particular , @xmath1 is positive )",
    ". it would be surprising if it were otherwise .",
    "this means that the background arena for all natural phenomena , once all physical matter - energy has been ideally removed , is the ( maximally symmetric ) de sitter spacetime @xmath38 ( whose radius @xmath39 is related to @xmath1 by the equation @xmath40 ) in place of the familiar flat minkowski spacetime @xmath41 , which can be recovered only in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "there is of course no compelling reason to exclude that part of the measured value of the cosmological constant may be indeed due to some form of gravitationally repulsive stuff whose physical origin still escapes our grasp , so that theoretical and experimental investigations regarding the nature of this substance are certainly justified . however , we maintain that at least a residual part of @xmath1 has indeed to be regarded as a fundamental constant of nature .",
    "+ thus , in the approximation in which the warping effects of gravitation on the geometry of spacetime can , at least locally , be neglected , the existence of a residual curvature leads naturally to the problem of reformulating the theory of special relativity as a de sitter relativity , based on @xmath26 invariance , in place of the customary minkowskian relativity , based on poincar invariance .",
    "the formulation of a de sitter relativity presents nontrivial complications compared to the minkowski case .",
    "indeed , in minkowski space there is a class of privileged reference frames ( coordinate systems ) , the inertial ones relative to which the laws of nature have a particularly simple form which is form invariant under the transformations of the underlying kinematical group ( poincar invariance ) .",
    "instead , due to the presence of curvature , no such class of privileged coordinate systems exists in the de sitter manifold , in spite of the fact that the latter , like minkowski space , is maximally symmetric .",
    "therefore , in @xmath38 any coordinate patch is in principle equally suitable for the formulation of a particular law , which will thus acquire a generally covariant form , and the notion of observer becomes a strictly local one . to overcome this difficulty it is important to investigate whether and to what extent meaningful physical quantities and properties can be expressed in an intrinsic form , independent of the choice of any particular coordinate system .",
    "besides introducing and developing the general setting , the contribution of this paper , which is kept at the purely classical level , consists in carrying out this program for the description of the free motion of classical particles and of particle collisions in terms of an intrinsic characterization of the associated conservation laws .",
    "+ finally , we would like to make the following remark . in the galilei group",
    "both translations and boosts form abelian subgroups .",
    "the transition from nonrelativistic mechanics to einstein s special relativity , namely the transition from the galilei group to that of poincar arises due to the noncommutativity of boosts , while translations remain commutative .",
    "if one had decided instead to drop the commutativity of translations while preserving that of boosts , one would arrive at the newton - hooke group @xcite which corresponds to a world without limiting velocity , but with a constant spatial curvature .",
    "we make no prior assumptions on spacetime @xmath42 except that it is a four - dimensional continuum which , according to the principle of the absolute world , should embody the properties of homogeneity of space and time , of isotropy of space , and of invariance under boosts .",
    "this leads us to assume that its kinematical group is a ten - dimensional lie group .",
    "we follow the treatment of reference @xcite . however , we do not require space reflection and time reversal to be automorphisms of the lie algebra of the group and exploit only the transformation properties of the generators under space reflection .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) respectively the generators of space rotations , space translations , time translation and boosts .",
    "they form a basis for the lie algebra of the group .",
    "the isotropy of space implies that * j , p * and * k * are vectors and that @xmath46 is a scalar so that the following lie brackets should hold @xmath47 = 0 \\ , \\quad   \\left[j_i , p_j \\right ] = \\epsilon_{ijl } p_l \\ , \\quad \\left[j_i , j_j \\right ] = \\epsilon_{ijl } j_l \\ , \\quad \\left[j_i , k_j \\right ] = \\epsilon_{ijl } k_l \\label{cinque } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the remaining lie brackets have the general form : @xmath48 = \\omega_i h + \\gamma_{il } p_l + \\varepsilon_{il } j_l + \\alpha_{il } k_l \\ , \\cr & & \\left[h , k_i \\right ] = \\chi_i h + \\lambda_{il } p_l + \\zeta_{il } j_l + \\eta_{il } k_l \\ , \\cr & & \\left[p_i , p_j \\right ] = \\iota_{ij } h + \\varphi_{ijl } p_l + \\beta_{ijl } j_l + \\psi_{ijl } k_l \\ , \\label{10 } \\\\ & & \\left[k_i , k_j \\right ] = \\xi_{ij } h + \\nu_{ijl } p_l + \\mu_{ijl } j_l + \\upsilon_{ijl } k_l \\ ,   \\cr & & \\left[p_i , k_j \\right ] = \\rho_{ij } h + \\pi_{ijl } p_l+\\sigma_{ijl } j_l + \\tau_{ijl } k_l \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\",

    "such a peculiarity of the de sitter universe is connected with its maximal symmetry . what happens if the symmetry is reduced , while still keeping , however , the homogeneity and isotropy of space ? in this section we look at this problem from the point of view of differential geometry .",
    "precisely , we consider a family of flat friedmann universes with an arbitrary law of dependence of the scale factor on the cosmic time parameter and look for its symmetry generators by solving the corresponding killing equations ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we prove that any such friedmann universe either has exactly six killing fields , corresponding indeed to invariance under space rotations and translations , or it is maximally symmetric , being thus de sitter ( or minkowski ) . in other words , there are no flat friedmann metrics which are not maximally symmetric but have more than six independent killing fields .",

    "thus we have a situation which is similar , though more general , to the one which one encounters in traditional einsteinian relativity .",

    "it is based on a formulation of the wightman axioms for a general scalar field on @xmath38 in which the spectral condition is replaced by suitable global analyticity properties of the wightman functions in the complexified de sitter manifold .",
    "they closely mirror the analogous analyticity properties which provide an equivalent characterization of the ordinary spectral condition in the minkowskian case .",
    "the ground states of this ( possibly interacting ) field theory are exactly those which satisfy the kms condition @xcite with respect to the time translation groups of the geodesic observers of @xmath38 corresponding to the temperature @xmath470 .",
    "this result provides a rigorous foundation to the discovery by gibbons and hawking @xcite that a geodesic observer in @xmath38 , equipped with a particle detector , will observe a thermal radiation at the given temperature , coming apparently from the observer s cosmological horizon .",
    "it is well known that this effect is the analogue in @xmath38 of the hawking effect of thermal black hole evaporation @xcite and of the thermal excitation of a uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have discussed a classical analogue of the thermal nature of the de sitter `` vacua '' .",
    "+ however , we must mention that , as far as interacting fields are concerned , practical calculations of particle scattering and decay amplitudes in a de sitter background are still at a very early stage .",
    "it is true that , due to the smallness of the cosmological constant , a development of a quantum theory of interacting fields in ds(1,3 ) ( such as a de sitter qed or qcd ) is more of foundational than of practical importance for particle physics at the present epoch .",
    "it may , however , be important for the analysis of particle processes at the epoch of inflation , when the effective cosmological constant was very large @xcite .",
    "for example , a possible theoretical understanding of the structure of the universe as it is today may be based on the nature of the fluctuations of the quantum fields on the inflationary de sitter spacetime , fluctuations which are held responsible for the primordial density inhomogeneities which have given origin to the structures which exist in the universe today .",
    "+ perturbative calculations of transition amplitudes in @xmath38 are much more complicated than in the minkowski case due to the lack of commutativity of spacetime translations @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "so far the only perturbative problem in the context of an explicit model of interacting quantum fields , which has been analyzed in detail in a de sitter background , concerns the computation to lowest order in the coupling constant of the probability per unit time of a scalar particle of mass @xmath177 to decay into two identical scalar particles of mass @xmath471 @xcite .",
    "contrary to what happens in the flat case , it turns out that , provided @xmath177 is larger than a critical value @xmath472 , the decay probability is nonzero , even if @xmath473 . from a group theoretical point of view",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that the direct integral decomposition into irreducible components of the direct product by itself of the irreducible representation of @xmath3 corresponding to mass @xmath471 contains contributions from all masses @xmath474 .",
    "a more intuitive physical interpretation of the result is the following : if @xmath473 , in minkowski space the decay process @xmath475 is forbidden by energy conservation . in a de sitter background",
    "it is also forbidden classically ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] ) since the process is strictly localized , hence it does not feel the repulsive effect of the cosmological constant .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanically , the spread of the wave packet is sensitive to this effect , which can therefore provide the missing energy which is needed for the process to take place .",
    "in particular , if one computes the decay probability to lowest order in the cosmological constant , one finds that the correction to the flat term is proportional to @xmath476 , where @xmath477 and @xmath478 is the de sitter mass .",
    "since @xmath161 we have @xmath479 ( @xmath480 ) so that no reasonable process of this kind can take place at the present epoch .",
    "on the other hand , processes of this type may have been frequent during the inflation era , when @xmath39 was much smaller .",
    "the preceding considerations indicate that a consistent study of quantum field theory in a de sitter background is desirable due to its potentially important impact in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "+ we conclude with the following lyrically sad observation . if dark energy indeed corresponds to a cosmological constant , which is the feeling that we have , the de sitter geometry is the one which the geometry of the universe does asymptotically tend to .",
    "then , in spite of its great importance for cosmology , it is perhaps an ironical fact that the cosmological constant will also eventually bring cosmology to an end @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to luca rizzi for the skillful processing of the figures .",
    "a real simple lie group @xmath11 is naturally provided with a non degenerate metric , the killing metric .",
    "this is obtained starting from the killing form on the corresponding lie algebra @xmath481 : @xmath482,\\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath483 $ ] is the adjoint representation .",
    "the next step is to use the fact that the group is endowed with the left translation @xmath484 which , by the definition of a lie group , is a differentiable map .",
    "this can be used to `` translate '' the killing form everywhere on @xmath11 via pullback .",
    "indeed , @xmath485 , @xmath486 being the unit element , so that one can define the product in @xmath487 @xmath488 let us see how this can be computed practically .",
    "let @xmath489 be some differentiable local coordinatization of the group : @xmath490 an infinitesimal displacement @xmath491 in @xmath492 determines an infinitesimal displacement @xmath493 living in @xmath494 , @xmath495 .",
    "the left translation can then be used to translate such a displacement in @xmath496 : @xmath497 note that this formula holds even if @xmath167 parameterizes only a submanifold of @xmath11 . in this case",
    "this gives the metric induced on the submanifold @xmath498 in general , for a simple lie group , in place of the adjoint representation any faithful representation can be used to compute the killing product , all differing by some constant .",
    "we use this property to construct the metric on @xmath38 , the hyperboloid ( [ hyperboloid ] ) . with this aim",
    ", we need to identify the hyperboloid with a submanifold of the group itself and then need to induce the killing metric on it .",
    "this is done by noting that the natural action of @xmath3 on itself or on its lie algebra is the adjoint action so that , with the identifications @xmath499 , @xmath500 , @xmath501 , we have the actions @xmath502 where @xmath503 and @xmath504 .",
    "such actions correspond to isometries of the killing metric because @xmath505={\\rm tr}[(h^{-1 } dh ) ( h^{-1 } dh)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subset @xmath126 of @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath38 must then be parameterized by the points @xmath506 . therefore , we need to construct matrices @xmath141 which transform as @xmath507 under a transformation @xmath508 .",
    "thus @xmath141 can be thought of as a tensor with a covariant index and a contravariant index .",
    "the most general tensor of this kind that we can construct with @xmath119 is @xmath509 with @xmath81 and @xmath91 as scalar coefficients . to live in @xmath3",
    ", @xmath46 must satisfy @xmath510 which yields @xmath511 and @xmath512 . the condition @xmath513 forces to take the minus sign .",
    "thus , @xmath514 note that @xmath515 so that @xmath516 and @xmath517",
    ". then @xmath518 thus we find @xmath519 dropping the unessential constant factor @xmath520 , we see that the invariant metric on @xmath38 is exactly the one inherited from its embedding in @xmath95 .",
    "in this appendix we collect some technical facts about geometry on curved manifolds from an elementary point of view .",
    "a non trivial problem on curved manifolds @xmath521 is the calculation of derivatives of vector fields .",
    "usually , a derivative compares the values of a function at points which are close to each other .",
    "now , a vector field @xmath522 is a function that at any point @xmath523 associates a vector @xmath524 in the tangent space @xmath525 at @xmath521 in @xmath220 .",
    "then , if @xmath526 are two distinct points of @xmath521 , @xmath524 and @xmath527 are vectors belonging to different tangent spaces and can not be directly compared .",
    "therefore , to compare @xmath527 and @xmath524 we need means to transport , say , @xmath524 to the tangent space at @xmath528 . this operation is called _",
    "parallel transport_. then , suppose we move from @xmath220 to @xmath528 along a curve @xmath529 \\longrightarrow m\\ , \\qquad \\ \\gamma(0)=p\\ , \\quad \\gamma(h)=q \\ .\\label{b1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an infinitesimal displacement ( @xmath530 ) we expect that under the transport from @xmath220 to @xmath528 the vector @xmath524 will change by an infinitesimal amount , proportional to the displacement : @xmath531 . obviously @xmath532 must also depend linearly on @xmath524 . then , if @xmath248 , @xmath533 , are local coordinates in a neighborhood containing @xmath220 and @xmath528 and if we put @xmath534 , the infinitesimal change , expressed in terms of the corresponding contravariant components of the vector field , will be @xmath535 where we use the einstein convention : repeated indexes are summed over .",
    "the coefficients @xmath536 , which depend on @xmath220 , define the _",
    "connection_. the sign is conventional .",
    "now the transported vector @xmath537 belongs to the same tangent space as @xmath527 so that we can subtract it from @xmath527 and define , in the limit @xmath530 , the _ covariant derivative _ @xmath538 as @xmath539 thus , in terms of components , @xmath540 formula ( [ b4 ] ) defines the derivative of a contravariant vector field . to establish the covariant derivative of a covariant vector field @xmath541 ( one - form ) we proceed as follows .",
    "the expression @xmath542 is a scalar , hence it does not change under transport and its covariant derivative is its ordinary derivative .",
    "then , requiring the covariant derivative to obey the leibniz rule , we have @xmath543 so that @xmath544      in general there is no further rule to determine the coefficients of the connection . however , in our case there are two facts which give rise to a natural choice of the connection .",
    "+ the first one is suggested by our discussion in section [ ssec : causal ] of the geometrical meaning of relations ( [ 101 ] ) and ( [ 103 ] ) expressing the noncommutativity of spacetime translations .",
    "we stated there that an infinitesimal displacement in the direction @xmath163 composed with an analogous displacement in the direction @xmath162 , followed next by the inverse displacements produces the same result as a small rotation ( or boost ) in the @xmath163@xmath162 plane at the starting point .",
    "if we want to realize this fact geometrically , it is natural to ask this sequence of four infinitesimal displacements to lead us back to the starting point . in other words ,",
    "the composition of these displacements will define a closed rectangle .",
    "then , if we denote by @xmath545 and @xmath546 the two infinitesimal vectors representing such displacements on the given plane , this rectangle must be generated by first transporting @xmath545 from @xmath248 to @xmath547 and next transporting @xmath548 from @xmath248 to @xmath549 , @xmath248 being the coordinates of the starting point @xmath220 . for simplicity",
    "we can assume @xmath550 .",
    "the resulting rectangle is closed if @xmath551 . using the expression above in terms of the coefficients of the connection , we find @xmath552 which must be true for arbitrary @xmath545 and @xmath546 .",
    "this implies the connection to be symmetric : @xmath553 a connection satisfying this property is said to be _ torsion free _ .",
    "+ however , the torsionless condition is not necessarily the natural one , and theories with torsion appear frequently in physics .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the vanishing of the torsion is a strong condition which requires further physical motivations .",
    "but here there is no question of invoking such principle since we confine ourselves to formulating a special theory of relativity .",
    "in this perspective , the torsion free condition is just a choice and can not be deduced . in other words , the naive argument of the closure of the rectangle should be intended here as the one corresponding to the simplest choice , not as a proof .",
    "a correct presentation for the torsion tensor field is to define it as the vector bundle valued two - form @xmath554 which , applied to two vector fields @xmath555 and @xmath522 , measures the difference between their covariant commutator and their lie bracket : @xmath556.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath557 denotes the covariant derivative of the vector field @xmath522 along the direction @xmath555",

    "is called a _",
    "metric - compatible transport_. then , if @xmath248 and @xmath547 are the coordinates of @xmath220 and @xmath528 and if @xmath548 is small , the parallel transport is determined by the condition @xmath561 since @xmath522 , @xmath31 and @xmath464 are arbitrary vectors , this relation gives , to first order in @xmath464 , @xmath562 using the symmetry of the connection coefficients and denoting as usual by @xmath563 the inverse metric of @xmath564 we can solve this w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath565 and find @xmath566 this is called the _ levi - civita ( christoffel ) connection_. it is the unique torsion free connection for which the transport preserves the scalar product of vectors .",
    "+ here we also recall that , as is well known , the metric tensor @xmath564 and its contravariant form @xmath563 can be used to lower and raise indices of vectors and tensors .",
    "for example , @xmath567 and @xmath568 .",
    "if we identify @xmath521 with the spacetime manifold @xmath42 , the parallel transport of levi - civita gives rise to a natural motion of free particles on @xmath42 .",
    "specifically , suppose a massive particle is moving along a timelike path @xmath569 , @xmath570 , where @xmath342 is the time coordinate relative to some local coordinate patch @xmath571 .",
    "we denote by @xmath572 the four - velocity of the particle , @xmath573 being the proper time .",
    "the vector @xmath574 is tangent to the trajectory @xmath575 .",
    "if the particle is not acted upon by any force , so that it moves freely , we expect that the parallelly transported vector @xmath574 coincides all the time with @xmath574 itself .",
    "in other words , the covariant derivative of @xmath574 along @xmath167 should be zero : @xmath576 if we think of @xmath42 as being uniformly filled with an ideal gas of freely moving particles , then @xmath574 is the four - velocity field of the gas and ( [ b13 ] ) can be written as @xmath577 ( [ b13 ] ) is called the geodesic equation and its solutions are the geodesic curves .",
    "the geodesics are the stationary curves of the proper time functional @xmath578=\\int \\sqrt{g_{\\sigma\\rho}(\\gamma(t))\\frac { d\\gamma^\\sigma}{dt } \\frac { d\\gamma^\\rho}{dt}}dt \\ .\\label{b15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      it is intuitively clear that the curvature properties of a manifold should be determined by how a vector changes under parallel transport . and ,",
    "indeed , these properties are locally characterized completely by a fourth order tensor field , called the _ curvature tensor _ , which determines how a vector changes when it is parallelly transported along an infinitesimally small closed loop . denoting by @xmath167 such a small loop we have @xmath579 and using stokes theorem to transform the line integral into a surface integral @xmath580d\\sigma^{\\lambda\\rho } \\ , \\label{b17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath409 is the surface bounded by @xmath167 and @xmath581 is the surface element .",
    "since the loop is infinitesimal , we can approximate the integrand with its value at the starting point @xmath582 , and then we find , up to higher orders , @xmath583_{x = x_0 } \\ , \\label{b18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath584 is the area of the projection of the surface on the @xmath252@xmath585 plane . since @xmath522 is parallelly transported , we have @xmath586 so that we finally obtain @xmath587 where @xmath588 ( [ b20 ] ) is a tensor field called the _",
    "curvature tensor_. sometimes it is convenient to write it in the form @xmath589 moreover , one defines the _ ricci tensor _ as @xmath590 and the _ curvature scalar _",
    "a symmetry ( or isometry ) of a manifold with metric is a transformation of the manifold which leaves the metric field invariant . to understand what this means recall first that the metric @xmath564 , being a covariant tensor field , transforms as follows under a change of coordinates @xmath592 @xmath593",
    "if we interpret the map from the active point of view , it will define a transformation of the manifold : a point @xmath220 whose coordinates are @xmath594 is mapped to a new point @xmath595 whose coordinates ( relative to the same coordinate patch ) are @xmath596 .",
    "then , ( [ b24 ] ) establishes how the metric changes under such a transformation .",
    "we say that the map is an _ isometry _ if the metric is left invariant under the transformation , namely if @xmath597 if the transformation is an infinitesimal one , we can write it as @xmath598 , with @xmath599 and @xmath449 is a contravariant vector field .",
    "for such an infinitesimal transformation , inserting ( [ b25 ] ) into ( [ b24 ] ) and expanding to first order in @xmath600 , gives @xmath601 ( [ b26 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the covariant components @xmath602 of the field @xmath174 as follows : @xmath603 or , using ( [ b6 ] ) and ( [ b12 ] ) , @xmath604 ( [ b28 ] ) are called the _ killing equations _ and the fields @xmath605 which solve them , and which generate the isometries , are called the _ killing vectors _ of the manifold .      we can easily find the killing vectors of the minkowski hyperboloid @xmath38 , for any given value of the radius @xmath39 . indeed , since @xmath38 is isometrically embedded in @xmath95 , its isometries are the isometries of @xmath95 which leave each minkowski hyperboloid , solution of ( [ hyperboloid ] ) , invariant .",
    "now , the isometries of the flat metric @xmath606 are the transformations of the poincar group acting on @xmath95 whose subgroup which stabilizes each @xmath38 is the de sitter group @xmath3 , namely the lorentz group acting in one time plus four space dimensions .",
    "the generators of @xmath3 are the vector fields ( [ generators ] ) @xmath607 and therefore the killing fields of @xmath38 are simply the restrictions to @xmath38 itself of the fields ( [ b29 ] ) . indeed , because the transformations of @xmath3 map @xmath38 onto itself , such restrictions are automatically tangent to it and therefore define vector fields on @xmath38 .",

    "<S> this paper , which is meant to be a tribute to minkowski s geometrical insight , rests on the idea that the basic observed symmetries of spacetime homogeneity and of isotropy of space , which are displayed by the spacetime manifold in the limiting situation in which the effects of gravity can be neglected , leads to a formulation of special relativity based on the appearance of two universal constants : a limiting speed @xmath0 and a cosmological constant @xmath1 which measures a residual curvature of the universe , which is not ascribable to the distribution of matter - energy . that these constants should exist is an outcome of the underlying symmetries and is confirmed by experiments and observations , which furnish their actual values . specifically , it turns out on these foundations that the kinematical group of special relativity is the de sitter group @xmath2 . on this basis , we develop at an elementary classical and , hopefully , sufficiently didactical level the main aspects of the theory of special relativity based on @xmath3 ( de sitter relativity ) . as an application </S>",
