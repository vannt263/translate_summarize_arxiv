    "a special case of vorticity are the _ quantum vortices _",
    "@xcite which include vortices in superfluids , flux tubes in superconductors and cosmic strings .",
    "global cosmic strings are analogues to vortices in superfluids while local cosmic strings are analogues to flux tubes in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "all these vortices are described by a complex wave function or scalar field with a multivalued phase function @xmath0 , such that @xmath1 over a closed contour surrounding the string . as a result",
    "different physical quantities get quantized : the circulation of a superfluid vortex , the magnetic flux in a superconductor , the magnetic flux in a local cosmic string .",
    "vorticity was first investigated by helmholz and kelvin who set down the foundations for the study of vorticity in hydrodynamics . in this work",
    "we try to implement concepts born in the field of classical hydrodynamics to cosmic strings . as we shall see",
    "the interaction between these two fields can be very rewarding .",
    "turbulent fluid is regarded as full of vortex filaments  @xcite .",
    "quantum turbulence in superfluids has likewise been defined as a superfluid state featuring a tangle of quantum vortex filaments  @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with helicity of a tangle of cosmic strings .",
    "the concept of _ fluid helicity _ was introduced by moffatt  @xcite as a useful measure of the degree of linkage of ordinary fluid vortice loops .",
    "it is defined as the volume integral of the scalar product of a velocity field @xmath2 and its curl , the vorticity @xmath3 .",
    "following this , moffatt  @xcite and others  @xcite considered helicity integrals in general , i.e. the space integral over the scalar product of a vector field and its curl @xmath4 and found them to have a topological interpretation as the linking of the field lines of the divergence free field @xmath5 .",
    "thus the conservation of helicity can be explained for systems in which the field lines may not cross each other , such as vortex lines in an inviscid fluid and the magnetic field lines in a perfectly conducting fluid  @xcite . for these flows",
    "the field lines are said to be frozen into the flow , and the helicity is a topological invariant mathematically related to the hopf invariant  @xcite classifying the nontrivial homotopy classes of maps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    ", which are isomorphic to circles in @xmath6 .",
    "the hopf invariant is equivalent to the helicity integral of a vector field who s field lines lie tangent to the preimage circles . in this sense",
    "the hopf invariant is a helicity integral term , but the inverse is usually not the case . ]    superfluids and cosmic strings are both described by field theories of a complex field @xmath8 which obeys a nonlinear field equation  @xcite , e.g. the nonlinear ginzburg - pitaevskii equation  @xcite or the higgs equation .",
    "cosmic strings and superfluid vortices both occur in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite . a vortex filament or cosmic string is a configuration of @xmath9 which approaches asymptotically the broken symmetry vacuum , and is characterized by a phase @xmath0 which changes by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) when one goes once around the filament or string axis .",
    "@xmath12 , is termed the _ winding number of the string_. single valuedness of the field @xmath9 on the filament axis requires that @xmath13 along it .",
    "the curves along which @xmath13 define the position of the strings . a vortex filament or cosmic string",
    "must either be infinite in both directions , close on itself ( cosmic string loop , vortex ring ) , or terminate on a boundary of the system .",
    "otherwise the behavior of the phase just beyond the filament s free ends would be ambiguous .",
    "we assume throughout that all strings are closed un - knotted loops confined to a finite region .",
    "the analogy between vortices in superfluids and global cosmic strings has inspired the construction of a _",
    "helicity _ for global cosmic strings .",
    "bekenstein  @xcite defined a helicity for global strings , and vachaspati and field  @xcite , sato and yahikozawa  @xcite and sato  @xcite did this for local strings .",
    "these works tried to relate helicity for cosmic strings with the topological and geometrical structure of these strings ( such as linking , knotting , writhing and twisting ) .",
    "in all these works bizarre physical conclusions were drawn .",
    "bekenstein concluded that an isolated unknotted loop of global string is restricted to a plane  @xcite i.e. , only planar configurations may exist .",
    "this is strange since dynamically there seems to be no constraint on a loop accumulating a distortion continuously in an arbitrary direction .",
    "furthermore simulations of the formation and evolution of cosmic strings show the formation of loops which are not planar  @xcite .",
    "bekenstein also claimed that the contortion of a single knot is quantized in integers .",
    "this is also strange because it says a single knot may not wiggle freely about , but is frozen in a configuration of integer contortion .    for local cosmic strings there is a relation between the electroweak magnetic helicity of a tangle of strings and the violation of baryon number conservation via what is known as the chiral anomaly  @xcite .",
    "vachaspati and field , sato and yahikozawa and sato found the helicity to change continuously with the shape of the strings , which implies that baryon number changes continuously too .",
    "this clashes with the expectation that baryon number is quantized in integers .",
    "we show here that the topological interpretation of helicity as the linking of field lines themselves is not fully incorporated in these works , and hence an important term was left out , which accounts for all the mentioned unacceptable conclusions .",
    "helicity arises from internal structure within a string , determined by the twist and writhe of the string , in addition to the external relations between strings , i.e. linking and knotting .",
    "the missing term arises from the internal structure of field lines within the strings which we name _",
    "internal helicity_. it was previously believed  @xcite that since the strings length is much greater than its width , the internal structure of the string becomes unimportant and physical quantities of interest can be averaged over the string cross - section . however , as we will see this is not always the case .    in order to clarify the contribution of internal helicity , the relation of helicity to the topological structure of field lines will be further developed here .",
    "field lines of vector fields which are divergence - free do not have endpoints .",
    "this property allows us to examine such field structures in terms of the topology of closed curves .",
    "the link between helicity and topological invariants of curves was first conjectured by moffatt in 1981  @xcite and then developed by berger and field in 1984  @xcite . in 1992 moffatt and ricca  @xcite managed to derive the extra term , arising from the internal structure of magnetic flux tubes , directly from the field equations of motion for a magnetohydrodynamic fluid .",
    "this is not possible when calculating the helicity of cosmic strings since their equations are second order non - linear equations , and therefore the calculation is too complicated .",
    "however , using formulas describing curves , developed by mathematical biologists investigating the structure of dna  @xcite , the internal helicity may be calculated . by adding it to the external helicity we correct the mentioned results .",
    "in section  [ sec_2 ] we review the concept of _ helicity _ of a solenoidal ( divergence free ) vector field , and dwell on the relation of the helicity to the linking of the field lines of the solenoidal field . in section  [ sec_3 ]",
    "we review the construction and calculation of the helicity for a tangle of global cosmic string loops , as a function of different geometrical and topological properties of the strings  @xcite .",
    "next we correct the previously mentioned conclusions of bekenstein by means of the internal helicity . in section  [ sec_4 ]",
    "we deduce new constraints on the permitted linkages of string loops .",
    "we find that the linking possibilities of string loops depends on their winding numbers . in section  [ sec_5 ]",
    "we review how the electroweak helicity of local cosmic strings in the weinberg - salam model is related to the baryon number , and clarify how baryon number conservation is violated .",
    "the baryon number is found to be quantized , in contrast to previous results .",
    "again , we show how internal helicity accounts for the new results .",
    "the term _ helicity _ is used in particle physics for the scalar product of the momentum and spin of a particle .",
    "moffatt  @xcite adopted this term to describe the volume integral over the scalar product of a velocity field @xmath2 and its curl , the vorticity @xmath3 @xmath14 which he named the _ helicity of the flow_. this idea stemmed from the essentially kinematical interpretation of the quantity @xmath15 .",
    "the streamlines of the flow passing near any representative point @xmath16 in a small volume element @xmath17 are ( locally ) helices about the streamline through @xmath16 , and the contribution @xmath18 to @xmath19 from @xmath17 is positive or negative according as the screw of these helices is right - handed or left - handed .",
    "more generally , the concept of helicity describes the volume integral over the scalar product of any general vector and its curl .",
    "in particular , the magnetic helicity of magnetohydrodynamic flow @xmath20 had already been shown by woltjer  @xcite to be conserved for a perfectly conducting fluid .",
    "later moffatt  @xcite showed that the _ fluid helicity _ of an ideal barotropic fluid is conserved as well .",
    "both these cases share the property that the divergence free field lines ( vortex lines or magnetic field lines ) are frozen into the fluid , and that in consequence knots and linkages of the field lines are inevitably conserved .",
    "it was through struggling to understand the physical meaning of this result that moffatt was led to the topological interpretation of helicity in terms of links and knots in convected vector fields generally , and to the characterization of helicity as a _",
    "topological invariant _ for these cases .",
    "moreau  @xcite observed that conservation of fluid helicity can be deduced from noether s theorem .",
    "helicity thus appears to have status comparable to energy , momentum and angular momentum in this sense .",
    "as we shall see , unlike these quantities helicity also has a strong topological character . to demonstrate this we review the calculation of helicity for the simple case of two linked flux tubes and",
    "show that the helicity counts the gauss linking number of the tubes  @xcite .",
    "consider two flux tubes linked once ( fig .",
    "[ flux ] ) , carrying fluxes @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , of the vector field @xmath23 ( the flux is zero everywhere outside the filaments ) .",
    "4.5 cm    within each filament , the @xmath24-lines are unlinked curves which close on themselves after just one passage round the filament .",
    "the helicity @xmath19 of the two flux tubes has the same form as the pseudo - scalar quantity described in ( [ b_helicity ] ) .",
    "does not depend on the gauge of @xmath25 ; for if @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 , then @xmath19 is unchanged . ]",
    "adopting the coulomb gauge for @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , and imposing the further condition @xmath29 as @xmath30 , @xmath25 is given by the biot - savart law : @xmath31 so that from ( [ b_helicity ] ) , @xmath32    each tube may be built of many infinitely small flux tubes carrying fluxes @xmath33 and @xmath34 . replacing @xmath35 by @xmath36 : allowing for the fact that each flux filament is integrated over twice once as @xmath37 and once as @xmath38 , we find that @xmath39 with @xmath40 which is the gauss formula for the linking of two curves .",
    "the sign of @xmath41 depends on the relative orientations of the field in the two filaments ( according to the right hand rule).-lines within either tube on its own are unlinked closed curves . ]",
    "it is simple to obtain the total helicity of the two flux tubes .",
    "each pair of filaments ( one from each tube ) make a contribution @xmath42 to the total helicity , so that summing over all such pairs , this is now given by @xmath43    helicity has been shown to be an invariant for flows in which the divergence free field lines are frozen into the flow ( woltjer  @xcite for a perfectly conducting fluid and moffatt  @xcite for ideal barotropic flow ) .",
    "combining this knowledge with ( [ link_hell ] ) , the interpretation of the invariant in terms of conservation of linkage of the ( vortex / magnetic ) field lines which are frozen in the fluid is immediate .",
    "states of a higgs field containing a tangle of cosmic strings resemble a tangle of quantum vortex filaments which arise in quantum turbulent flow in superfluids .",
    "they are both described by a complex wave function @xmath8 and a winding number @xmath12 .",
    "the phase @xmath0 changes by @xmath10 when one goes once around the filament or string axes .",
    "the curve @xmath13 defines the position of the strings and the passage from @xmath13 to the vacuum value of @xmath44 takes place over a certain lengthscale denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "this lengthscale is very small in comparison with the strings lengths and distances between the strings , i.e. the strings are very thin .    motivated by this resemblance bekenstein  @xcite designed a helicity for cosmic strings in analogy with fluid helicity of a superfluid .",
    "we first review the original calculation  @xcite of the helicity of a tangle of strings , and then correct it for the left - out contribution of internal helicity .      in a superfluid",
    "the velocity is proportional to the gradient of the phase of the wave function ; bekenstein defines the vector @xmath46 where @xmath47 is taken to be a function which rises rapidly from its value at a string axis @xmath48 to near its asymptotic value , @xmath49 , over an interval of @xmath50 which corresponds to a distance of order @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath51 is a kind of regularised velocity in that the singularity of @xmath52 on the axis is defused by the @xmath53 function ( far from the axis @xmath51 will drop inversely with the distance from it as befits a vortex velocity field ) .",
    "we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the derivative of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath55 has a rather sharp peak at a distance @xmath57 from a string axis and the integral of @xmath58 over all @xmath56 is unity .",
    "the helicity of the field @xmath51 is defined as @xmath59 unlike ordinary fluid helicity , this one vanishes .",
    "this is clear since the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath60 are perpendicular by construction .",
    "nevertheless , string loops ( and vortex rings ) can link , and knot , and their linkage is correlated with other topological properties of the strings to be introduced later .    throughout it",
    "is assumed that linked and knotted loops can occur over some periods with no intersections .",
    "situations where there are intersecting strings are viewed as representing singular moments , not generic ones .",
    "( simulations of the development of superfluid vortices  @xcite and global cosmic strings  @xcite confirm this assumption ) .",
    "bekenstein develops from the zero helicity a quantitative relation between the linkage and other properties of the loops .      in order to evaluate the helicity explicitly for a tangle of cosmic string loops ,",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ h ] ) as a two - point functional of @xmath51   ( this is valid if the loops are confined to a finite region  @xcite ) @xmath61 = \\int d^3r \\int d^3r'\\ , \\frac{(\\nabla \\times { \\bf v } )    \\times(\\nabla \\times { \\bf v } ) ' \\cdot ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}')}{4\\pi|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|^3}.\\ ] ]    we follow bekenstein in the following discussion of the reduction of @xmath62 $ ] , and the conclusions that may be drawn from it . for field configurations of size large compared to @xmath45 , and where all the string axis are always well apart on scale @xmath45 , @xmath19 receives a contribution only when each of @xmath63 and @xmath64 lies very close to a string axis .",
    "this stems from the fact that the @xmath58 function in ( [ curl_v ] ) confines the integrals to very near the axis .",
    "hence , bekenstein assumes @xmath19 is equivalent to a double line integral taken along the string axis .",
    "in addition the cross section of each loop is very little distorted by the presence of the other loops and nearby portions of itself and therefore is assumed to possess a line symmetry . under these assumptions and",
    "a few manipulations bekenstein concludes that @xmath65 for the contribution of a little piece of string , where @xmath66 here is the vectorial line element along the piece of string considered .    inserting ( [ c_flux ] ) into ( [ helic ] )",
    "we obtain a double contribution to helicity from each pair of loops , because @xmath66 may progress through one loop ( call it @xmath67 ) while @xmath68 does so through the other ( @xmath69 ) and vice - versa .",
    "in addition we obtain a contribution from each string loop alone so that @xmath70 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i \\neq j } 2{\\cal l}_{ij}(2\\pi|n_i|)(2\\pi|n_j| ) + \\sum_i { \\cal w}_i(2\\pi|n_i|)^2.\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the _ gauss linking number _",
    "( [ gauss_link ] ) of the two loops @xmath67 and @xmath69 and @xmath72 is the _ writhing _ number of loop @xmath73 ( fuller  @xcite ) . )",
    "differs from the original one in  @xcite by a factor of @xmath74 which was missed in the previous calculation . ] while @xmath75 is a topological invariant of the linking of the string loops and must be an integer , @xmath76 is not a topological invariant .",
    "it changes with the shape of the loop and can obtain any value .",
    "@xmath76 measures the deviation of a loop from its plane ; the writhe of a planar loop is zero .",
    "when all loops are confined to a finite region , @xmath77 , and ( [ hel_eq ] ) gives @xmath78 we thus obtain a constraint connecting the linking of a collection of loops with their geometrical shapes .",
    "particularly simple is the case of an isolated loop . then @xmath79",
    "for such a loop we must have @xmath80 too . according to this result",
    "_ an isolated un - knotted loop must be a planar loop at any instant _",
    "this is hard to accept since dynamically there seems to be no constraint on a loop accumulating a distortion continuously in an arbitrary direction .",
    "furthermore simulations of the formation and evolution of cosmic strings  @xcite show the formation of loops which are not planar ! similarly , according to ( [ const ] ) two loops linked once may never be planar since the contribution of their writhe to the helicity must cancel out the contribution from their linkage .",
    "this restriction is again hard to accept .    to obtain",
    "another constraint bekenstein introduces the relation  @xcite @xmath81 @xmath82 measures the knotting of the curve and can jump by increments of @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the _ contortion _ of the loop defined by @xmath85 which integrates the torsion over the whole loop.the axis of a string can be treated as a curve in differential geometry .",
    "a curve @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the arc length ) has @xmath88 as unit tangent vector , has a unit normal @xmath12 , and a unit binormal @xmath89 .",
    "they are connected by the frenet - serret equations @xmath90 where @xmath91 , a positive scalar , is called the curvature of the curve , and @xmath92 , which may take on either sign , is called the torsion . ] inserting @xmath93 from ( [ knotting ] ) into ( [ const ] ) gives the following constraint connecting the contortion , knotting and linking of a collection of loops : @xmath94 this relation says that the sum of contortions of a collection of unit winding number loops is quantized in integers  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the contortion of any single knot is quantized in integers : the knot can not wiggle freely about , but is frozen in a configuration of integer contortion .",
    "this is a very strong constraint on the dynamics of such a configuration , and together with our previous observations , makes us suspect that the calculation has missed a term .",
    "the first clue of the missing term was presented by moffatt  @xcite , who notes that close inspection of an expression of the form @xmath95 integrated over a single flux loop @xmath67 ( of an arbitrary divergence - free vector field ) , shows that the helicity in this limit has an additional contribution from pairs of points @xmath63 , @xmath64 separated by a distance comparable to the cross - sectional span of the loop . in addition to the writhe @xmath93 ( [ writh ] ) , which we introduced earlier as the sole contribution to helicity from a single loop , moffatt conjectures that the close points contribute an extra term namely @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the contortion of loop @xmath73 defined earlier , and @xmath98 is the flux of the loop .",
    "actually it is easy to see that bekenstein s calculation in sec .",
    "[ global_helicity ] ignores the thickness of the string , i.e. the contribution from close pairs of points @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "equation  ( [ c_flux ] ) reduces a volume integral to a line integral along the core of the string and thus treats the string as though it where infinitely thin .",
    "moffatt speculates that the additional contribution , from close pairs of points @xmath63 and @xmath64 , is related to the contortion so that the helicity will be a topological invariant of the loop , i.e. , @xmath99 by ( [ knotting ] ) .",
    "but , thinking this over we realize that the contortion is also just a property of the flux tube s ( string s ) axis and not of its internal structure hence we should expect a different term to appear .",
    "later moffatt  @xcite explicitly calculated the helicity of a magnetohydrodynamic system of flux tubes to find that his earlier speculation was not exact , and that @xmath82 is not a topological invariant after all since its value jumps discontinuously at inflexion points ( points of zero curvature ) . in this later calculation moffatt",
    "manipulates the magnetohydrodynamic equation of motion of a configuration of field lines moving with the flow .",
    "this calculation is much too complicated to carry over to the case of cosmic strings since the field equations for these are non - linear .",
    "hence we will follow in the footsteps of berger and field  @xcite who also calculate the internal helicity due to the internal structure of a flux tube , but we will present a slightly different calculation , and a slightly different result .",
    "berger and field s result was that @xmath100 where @xmath101 is any real number , while we obtain the same result as moffatt  @xcite with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , an integer , is the linking number of the field lines in the flux tube .",
    "we first calculate exactly the contribution to the helicity of a single vortex loop @xmath104 .",
    "first we consider the inner structure of the string to consist of nested toroidal vorticity surfaces ( a peace of the loop is shown in fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "then we may build up the string by increments of vorticity flux @xmath105 composed of many thin flux tubes @xmath106 that wind around the inner flux tube @xmath98 @xmath103 times .",
    "the increment in helicity for each such flux tube @xmath106 is @xmath107 where @xmath103 is the gauss linking number of element @xmath108 with @xmath98 ( the inner flux tube ) .",
    "the increment in helicity for the whole of @xmath105 is simply @xmath109 .",
    "( the flux @xmath105 simply counts the number of field lines intersecting the increment in the cross section of the string , and hence the number of field lines wrapped around the flux tube in the center . )",
    "we thus have according to ( [ helic ] ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is along the axis of the string and @xmath112 is along one of the field lines in @xmath106 wrapping @xmath98 , and vice - versa . finally , integrating over all the nested flux tubes @xmath113 where @xmath12 is the winding number of the cosmic string ( the flux @xmath98 is easily calculated using the definition of @xmath51 , stoke s theorem and ( [ q_phase ] ) ) .    throughout this calculation",
    "we have assumed that @xmath106 and @xmath98 have the same linking number as a single field line in @xmath114 with the axis of the string .",
    "we have also assumed that all field lines have the same linking number with the axis of the string ( and with each other ) .",
    "this is plausible for a continuous field . as we see",
    ", the internal helicity is due to the linking of the @xmath60 field lines inside the string .",
    "this linking occurs when the field @xmath60 is twisted : if the field lines do not link the internal helicity is zero .",
    "we would now like to express the linking number of the field lines @xmath103 as a sum of @xmath93 and some other term or terms , so that we may reconcile this calculation with bekenstein s result ( [ hel_eq ] ) .",
    "the linking number @xmath103 of @xmath108 with @xmath98 is equal to the linking number of a single field line in @xmath108 with the axis of the string .",
    "since these are two closed curves at a very short distance apart , the axis of the string can be treated as a curve in differential geometry , forming the edge of a ribbon whose other edge is traced by the field line .",
    "this type of problem appears first to have been addressed by clugreanu  @xcite , who considered two neighboring closed curves @xmath115 , @xmath116 forming the boundaries of a ( possibly knotted ) ribbon of small spanwise width @xmath117 , and showed that for sufficiently small @xmath117 the linking number @xmath103 of @xmath115 and @xmath116 can be expressed in the form @xmath118 where @xmath93 and @xmath84 are respectively the writhe and the contortion of @xmath115 , and @xmath119 is an integer representing the number of rotations of the unit spanwise vector @xmath120 on the ribbon relative to the frenet pair ( the unit normal and unit binormal . ] ) in one passage round @xmath115 .",
    "( the contortion @xmath84 actually measures the rotation round the curve of the frenet pair itself . )",
    "8.5 cm 2.5 cm    the frenet pair has discontinuous behavior in going through a point of inflexion ( zero curvature ) . as a result @xmath84 and @xmath119",
    "are not well defined if @xmath115 has inflexion points .",
    "if @xmath115 is continuously deformed through an inflexional configuration , then @xmath84 is discontinuous by @xmath121 , but @xmath119 is simultaneously discontinuous by an equal and opposite amount @xmath122 , so that the sum @xmath123 does vary continuously through inflexion points  @xcite .",
    "this sum is known as the _ twist _ of the ribbon  @xcite @xmath124 thus , as we remarked earlier , @xmath125 is not a topological invariant while @xmath103 ( [ calig ] ) is .    with the help of ( [ calig ] ) and ( [ twist ] ) we are now ready to complete the calculation of the helicity for a single ( un- knotted ) cosmic string loop @xmath104 .",
    "we take @xmath115 above to be the string s axis and @xmath116 to be along one of the field lines twisted around the axis .",
    "then for the @xmath73-th loop @xmath126 our final expression for the helicity of a tangle of cosmic string loops is therefore @xmath127= \\sum_{i \\neq j}{\\cal l}_{ij}(2\\pi|n_i|)(2\\pi|n_j| ) + \\sum_i{\\cal w}_i(2\\pi n_i)^2",
    "+ { \\cal t}_i(2\\pi n_i)^2.\\ ] ] contrast this ( correct ) result with ( [ hel_eq ] ) .",
    "the twist @xmath128 is the contribution from the close pairs of points @xmath63 and @xmath129 inside the string ; it is not a property of the axes of the string alone , but rather of the internal structure of the field lines inside the string core .",
    "in the previous sections we learned that helicity measures the linkage of the field lines of @xmath130 , and that the total helicity of global cosmic strings is zero whatever their configuration may be . these properties must put some constraint on the possible configurations of the strings . in this section",
    "we show that the knotting and external linkage of a cosmic string determines the internal structure of the field lines inside the string , and thus external and internal helicity cancel each other out so that the total helicity is zero . since the field lines in a string must close on themselves , and their twist depends on external knotting and linking , we will get constraints on the possible configurations of string loops .",
    "these constraints are weaker than those proposed by bekenstein , and are free from the latter s paradoxical aspects .",
    "let us start by examining @xmath52 ( the gradient of the phase ) of the most simple configuration , a single loop . as we know",
    "the phase varies when one goes once around the string by @xmath10 , where @xmath12 is the winding number of the string .",
    "2.5 cm    what happens if the phase varies along the string too ? because of periodicity this is only possible if @xmath131 where @xmath66 is along the string axis .",
    "but in this case there will be another topological requirement . because the phase varies by @xmath132 around the perimeter of the loop , for every surface spanning the loop there must be at least one place where",
    "the amplitude @xmath13 so that the field @xmath9 will be single - valued .",
    "this is actually the requirement that the loop be threaded by another @xmath133 unit winding - strings or a single string with winding number @xmath133 .",
    "hence an isolated loop must have @xmath134 ; for a totally symmetric loop @xmath52 will have only one component , in the direction around the string . along the loop",

    "however , any configuration where the average of the component of @xmath52 along the loop is zero can be continuously deformed into a configuration where the component of @xmath52 along the loop equals zero at every point .",

    "how does this affect the configuration of the field lines of @xmath130 ?",
    "we recall that by definition ( [ vec_v ] ) , @xmath2 is parallel to @xmath52 and @xmath130 ( [ curl_v ] ) is perpendicular to @xmath2 .",
    "hence if @xmath2 has a component only around the string , @xmath130 will have a component only along the string , and its field lines will not be twisted or linked .",
    "since linkage of the field lines is a topological property , it will not change for continuous deformation of the loop ; therefore the field lines of any isolated loop with arbitrary shape will be unlinked .",
    "the immediate result is that _ the total helicity of any isolated loop with arbitrary shape is zero_. this corrects bekenstein s conclusion ( [ const ] ) that an isolated loop must be a planar loop at any instant so that the helicity will be zero .",
    "we next investigate a configuration of two linked loops @xmath135 and @xmath136 with winding numbers @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",

    "now that @xmath141 has components along the string and around it , we must introduce a new concept , the _ chirality _ ( handedness ) of a string loop . a loop is right - handed ( and has positive chirality ) when the component of @xmath52 along the string is in the direction of the thumb of the right hand , whose fingers point along the component of @xmath52 around the string .",
    "if the component of @xmath52 along the string is in an opposite direction to the thumb , the loop is left - handed ( and the chirality is negative ) .",
    "8.5 cm 3.5 cm    along with the definition of chirality comes the definition of the sign of the directions along and around the string . we define the positive direction around the string to coincide with the direction of @xmath52 around it , and the positive direction along the string to coincide with the direction of the thumb of the right hand whose fingers follow the direction of @xmath52 around the string axis . in a",
    "right - handed ( left - handed ) string loop whose phase changes around the string by @xmath10 and along the string by @xmath142 , @xmath12 and @xmath133 will have equal ( opposite ) signs .",
    "it is easy to see that _ two strings may link only if they have the same chirality _ ; otherwise there would be a discontinuity in the phase .    what will be the structure of the @xmath130 field lines in such a configuration ?",

    "the internal helicity of magnetic flux tubes in a magnetohydrodynamic fluid or of vortices in an ordinary fluid is arbitrary since there is no restriction on the linking of the field lines inside the flux tube . in those systems the internal structure of the field lines",
    "is not determined by the topology of the flux tubes or vortex filaments and , therefore , the total helicity can not be determined exactly from their configuration .",
    "by contrast we shall now show that the internal helicity of cosmic strings is solely determined by the winding numbers of the strings and their topological configuration , so that the total helicity for a configuration of linked vortices can be expressed as a function of their linkage and winding numbers alone .",

    "any ( un - knotted ) cosmic string loop may be deformed continuously into a planar circle loop , and the twist of the field lines inside it uniformly distributed , without changing the linking of the field lines .",
    "this is possible since the linking is a topological property of the field lines , and does not change by continuous deformations .",
    "it would further simplify our calculation if we could perform it in cylindrical symmetric coordinates , by virtually cutting the loop and standing it upright , such that it acquires cylindrical symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) . we may convince ourselves that this is possible since very close to the axis of the string the field lines have cylindrical symmetry around the string , and for reasons of continuity the linkage of the field lines can not change as we move away from the string .",
    "the linking number @xmath103 is simply the number of times @xmath146 is wrapped around the @xmath147 axis ( which coincides with the axis of the string ) .",

    "the velocity components of the particle are equal to the components of @xmath130 .",

    "is always in the positive direction i.e. along the thumb of the right hand whose fingers follow the positive direction around the axis of the string .",
    "[ f8 ] makes it clear that a right - handed configuration will have @xmath159 and the left - handed configuration will have @xmath160 .    the sign of the internal linking number @xmath103 also depends on whether the configuration is left - handed or right - handed . as we explained earlier , in a right - handed configuration @xmath12 and @xmath133 have equal signs while in a left - handed configuration , they have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , by ( [ int_link ] ) @xmath103 is negative for a right - handed pair and positive for a left - handed one . _",

    "previous works indicated a continuous change in baryon number . in contradiction to these works , we show here , by using our knowledge of the topological interpretation of helicity as the linking of field lines that , _ baryon number on local strings is quantized _ in this model .",

    "we shall now show that @xmath196 is just the total change in time of the magnetic helicity of the abelian higgs model with local vortex strings , and hence equal to the change in the external and internal linking numbers of the magnetic field lines each weighed by the square of the quantized flux in the corresponding vortex .    by construction @xmath201 , so we may write @xmath202 using maxwell s equations @xmath203 and @xmath204 and integration by parts , @xmath205 where we have used the relation @xmath206and the assumption that all fields die off at spatial infinity .",

    "coupled to gauge fields , certain current - conservation laws are violated by this anomaly .",
    "the term @xmath216 calculated on the background of the nielsen - olesen strings has been shown to cause violation of baryon number conservation via this anomaly .",
    "the anomaly arises when a classical symmetry of the lagrangian does not survive the process of quantization and regularization : the symmetry of the lagrangian is not inherited by the effective action .",
    "an axial current that is conserved at the level of the classical equations of motion can thus acquire a nonzero divergence through one - loop diagrams that couple this current to a pair of gauge boson fields . the feynman diagram that contains",

    "left and right handed fermions contribute terms with opposite signs to the anomaly ; however , in chiral theories in which the gauge bosons do not couple equally to right- and left - handed species , the sum of these terms can give a non - zero contribution . in theories such as qed or qcd in which the gauge bosons couple equally to right- and left - handed fermions , the anomalies automatically cancel .    within the standard model of weak interactions ( the glashow - weinberg - salam @xmath217 invariant theory ) ,",
    "the requirement from experiment that weak interaction currents are left - handed forces us to choose a chiral gauge coupling .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath218 boson to quarks and leptons can be derived by assigning the left - handed components of quarks and leptons to doublets of an @xmath219 gauge symmetry , and then identifying the @xmath218 bosons as gauge fields that couple to this @xmath219 group , while making the right - handed fermions singlets under this group .",
    "the restriction of the symmetry to left - handed fields leads to the helicity structure of the weak interactions effective lagrangian , and thus causes the chiral anomaly of the baryon current to arise .",
    "the baryon number current in this model is @xmath220 and the anomalous baryonic current conservation equation is @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the field strengths for the three @xmath219 and one @xmath193 gauge fields @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) and @xmath226 respectively , and @xmath227 and @xmath228 are their charges .",

    "the baryon number current can be integrated to yield the change in the baryon number between two different times , if we assume that the baryonic flux through the surface of the three - volume of interest vanishes : @xmath230 equations ( [ current_anomaly ] ) and ( [ delta_charge ] ) relate the change in the baryon number to terms of the form @xmath231 which we calculated in the previous section for an abelian model on the background of nielsen - olesen vortices .",
    "this term was found to be related to the change in the sum of the linking of the strings from their initial to final configurations ( [ fin_i ] ) .",
    "this leads us to an exciting idea  @xcite : if chiral fermions are coupled to electroweak vortices , baryon number may be violated because of the anomaly as vortices link and de - link . for this to happen",
    "there must be a stable string solution in this model , and the change in the baryon number must be related to the helicity of an electroweak field whose flux is confined to the string .",
    "it is generally believed that the standard electroweak model is free from topological defects .",
    "the reason is that the first homotopy group of @xmath232 can be shown to be trivial i.e. @xmath233  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that the model is free from non - topological defects .",
    "it has been shown by manton  @xcite that the configuration space of classical bosonic weinberg - salam theory has a non - contractible loop .",
    "hence an unstable , static , finite - energy solution of the field equations can exist .",
    "vachaspati  @xcite showed that exact vortex solutions exist , which are stable to small perturbations for large values of the weinberg angle @xmath234 and small values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by the numerical results of james , perivolaropoulos and vachaspati  @xcite .    defining @xmath235 where @xmath236 , the static vortex solution that extremizes the energy functional was found to be : @xmath237 and @xmath238 the subscript @xmath239 on the functions @xmath240 and @xmath194 means that they are identical to the corresponding functions found by nielsen and olesen for the usual abelian - higgs string .",
    "in other words , the weinberg - salam theory has a vortex solution which is simply the @xmath239 vortex of the abelian higgs model embedded in the non - abelian theory . substituting this solution into ( [ current_anomaly ] ) we have @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the change in the baryon number is now @xmath244 via equations ( [ delta_charge ] ) , ( [ z_current ] ) and ( [ i_rel ] ) and with @xmath245 playing the role of baryon number charge .",
    "we see that the change in the baryon number is proportional to the change in the @xmath246 field s helicity . for a configuration of tangled strings with arbitrary winding numbers @xmath247 @xmath248 where the flux of each vortex is @xmath249 . ] and hence the factor of @xmath250 for the flux . ]",
    "the final result for a configuration of strings with unit winding number is @xmath251 and baryon number is quantized .",
    "earlier works failed to fully implement the topological interpretation of helicity as the measure of the linkage of field lines of the divergence free field .",
    "since field lines may be twisted and linked inside a vortex core , the inner structure of the field inside the core may not be ignored when calculating helicity terms . neglecting internal helicity",
    "had led to peculiar results : unacceptable constraints on string configurations and continuous violation of baryon number .",
    "once we add the contribution from the internal structure of the strings , we find new constraints on the configurations of linked global cosmic strings , which are physically more pleasing , and we also find that , the baryon number is quantized as we would expect .",
    "our work is another demonstration of the fact that helicity counts the linkage of the divergence free field lines .",
    "we explain how there is no contradiction between the fact that helicity counts the linkage of field lines , and that the total helicity of any configuration of knotted linked loops always manages to vanish .",
    "the vector @xmath252 ( [ vec_v ] ) constructed for the purpose of obtaining a helicity term for global cosmic strings is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "hence it is perpendicular to @xmath253 ( [ curl_v ] ) and the helicity must vanish . on the other hand",
    "the helicity counts the linkage of field lines of @xmath253 , and these lines must have external and internal linkages for linked configurations of cosmic string loops .",
    "what we have discovered is that the field lines arrange themselves in such a manner that the external and internal helicities exactly cancel each other .",
    "the field lines inside a string may not link in an arbitrary manner , their linkage is constrained by the topological configuration of the string and by its linking relations to other strings .",
    "further , we have discovered a constraint on the permitted configurations of un - knotted linked loops , in the form of ( [ gen_int_link ] ) which must produce integer values .",
    "this constraint results from the combination of the topological character of helicity integrals with the topological nature of cosmic strings as topological defects .    in this work we confined ourselves to the problem of un - knotted linked loops .",
    "the problem of knotted configurations is far more complicated since it is hard to separate the external contribution to helicity ( depending on the topology of the knot ) from the internal contribution depending on the twist of the field lines inside the knot .",
    "moffatt  @xcite proposed a method for calculating the external helicity , but it turns out that for some knotted configurations this method is ambiguous ( it may be that it works only for _",
    "chiral _ knots , i.e. knots that are not isotopic to their mirror images ) .",
    "hence , we leave the treatment of knots to later work .    for local cosmic strings in the standard model , the change in the helicity of the electroweak magnetic field confined to the strings core is related to the change in baryon number over a period of time ( [ z_helic ] ) .",
    "thus , baryon number conservation is violated as cosmic strings link and de - link . the idea that violation of baryon number",
    "may be related to the change in the linking of electroweak strings has been developed by cohen and manohar  @xcite , vachaspati and field  @xcite and garriga and vachapati  @xcite .",
    "however , they neglected the contribution of the writhe of the strings to helicity .",
    "sato  @xcite adds the writhe term , but misses out the twist term .",
    "this led to his conclusion that baryon number conservation is violated as vortices change their shape , which implies that baryon number may change continuously and , therefore , is not quantized . only by including both the writhe and the twist terms , which together give the internal linkage of the field lines ,",
    "do we recover a quantized baryon number !",
    "charge quantization has previously been related to flux quantization .",
    "it was suggested by dirac in 1931  @xcite to explain the quantization of the electric charge .",
    "this idea was developed further by jehle  @xcite . in general , quantization of charges",
    "is not a direct consequence of standard ( non - gut ) field theories . particularly , the quantization of electric charge has no widely accepted explanation within the standard model . during the last decade",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the electric charges can be heavily constrained within the framework of the standard model .",
    "this is achieved partly by constraints related to the classical structure of the theory ( such as the requirement that the lagrangian be gauge - invariant ) , and from the cancelation of anomalies , at the quantum level . the novel idea in this work",
    "is that quantization of the baryon number may arise from the topological nature of helicity integrals calculated on the background of local cosmic strings and from the flux quantization in the strings .",

    "<S> we apply the concept of helicity from classical hydrodynamics to elucidate two problematical issues in cosmic string physics . </S>",
    "<S> helicity , the space integral of the scalar product of a velocity - like field with its vorticity field ( curl ) , can be defined for a complex scalar field in analogy with fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we dwell on the topological interpretation of helicity as related to the linking of field lines of the vorticity field . </S>",
    "<S> earlier works failed to fully implement this interpretation for cosmic strings by missing a term connected with the linking of these lines inside the strings . as a result </S>",
    "<S> paradoxical conclusions were drawn : global cosmic string loops may not take on certain simple shapes , and baryon number is not quantized in integers in the presence of local cosmic strings in gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both paradoxes are removed when internal contributions to helicity are properly taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , quantization of baryon number can be understood within a special case of the glashow - weinberg - salam model if cosmic strings are the unique mechanism for baryosynthesis . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we find a new constraint on the permitted linkages of cosmic strings in a string tangle . </S>"
