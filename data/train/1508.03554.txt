    "wireless virtualization has recently emerged as an architectural choice for the wireless networks , in which different service providers can share physical infrastructure and wireless resources . allowing resources to be shared",
    ", vitualization can facilitate a flexible and lower - complexity solution to support customized services with finer control over quality - of - service ( qos ) features . to enable service customization",
    ", the key issue would be to provide isolation among virtual networks running by different service providers .",
    "such isolation can be achieved through contention - free resource allocation techniques based on tdma and/or fdma , by isolating resources across service providers .",
    "but , in systems using contention - based access protocols , providing isolation among virtual networks is more challenging .",
    "for instance , in virtualized 802.11 wlans , transmissions of different virtual wlans ( v - wlans ) are closely coupled , although administrative virtualization ( i.e. , one physical ap advertises multiple service set identifiers ( ssids ) ) can already differentiate groups of flows . with a carrier sense multiple access ( csma)-based mac",
    ", unavoidable collisions act to couple the transmissions of different v - wlans .",
    "moreover , since the network capacity is shared yet constrained , the increase of traffic in one v - wlan may reduce the available network capacity to another @xcite .",
    "thus , an efficient resource allocation among v - wlans is essential to manage the mac - layer couplings .    in a 802.11 wlan with densely deployed aps ,",
    "before a sta can access the network , it needs to make a decision about which ap to associate with . in virtualized 802.11 networks ,",
    "such sta - ap association control could create an opportunity to provide fairness guarantees among different isps .",
    "in addition to sta - ap association , the airtime among stas associated to the same ap can optimally be adjusted .",
    "controlling airtime usage of the stas provides the opportunity to optimize the wlan performance ( e.g. , improving wlan throughput by exploiting multi - user diversity ) as well as another degree of freedom to guarantee fairness among the isps .",
    "the main focus of this work is on the virtualization and optimization of a multi - cell wlan .",
    "more specifically , sta - ap association and airtime control are jointly explored to provide fairness and throughput guarantees for different v - wlans .",
    "taking into account sta transmission rates and isp airtime reservations , an optimization problem is formulated to adjust the transmission probability of each sta at each ap .",
    "the objective is to maximize the overall network throughput , while keeping a total airtime guarantee for each isp . to solve the formulated problem which is non - convex and thus computationally intractable , an iterative algorithm is developed through successive geometric programming .",
    "this algorithm can achieve an optimal solution with an affordable complexity .    furthermore , to implement the optimal transmission probabilities , we model the edca protocol with a three - dimensional markov chain and establish the relationship between the transmission probability of a sta and the edca parameters . based on this relationship , we developed a control algorithm to approach the optimal transmission probability by jointly manipulating the edca parameters such as contention window size ( cw ) and arbitration inter - frame space ( aifs ) .",
    "finally , through numerical results , we verify the performance enhancement provided by the developed sta - ap association and airtime control approach in terms of throughput and fairness .        in most current vendor implementations ,",
    "802.11 stas choose the ap with the highest received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to connect with .",
    "since the sta density is often uneven in the network @xcite , the max - snr approach can lead to an unbalanced distribution of stas among aps , causing unfairness . in order to balance the load of aps",
    ", several sta - ap association algorithms have been presented in the literature , mostly by maximizing the minimum throughput of all stas @xcite . nevertheless , in a basic service set ( bss ) including an ap and its associated multi - rate stas",
    ", it is shown that the throughput is limited by the sta with the lowest data rate .",
    "this phenomenon is also to as the _ performance anomaly _",
    "problem @xcite .",
    "thus , comparing with the max - snr approach , these load - balancing approaches improve the max - min fairness among stas at the cost of decreasing the aggregate throughput .    to address the _ performance anomaly _ and balance the trade - off between aggregate throughput and fairness , proportional fair throughput allocation has widely been considered in multi - rate 802.11 wlans @xcite . in @xcite , proportional fairness",
    "is studied in a single bss .",
    "it is shown that _",
    "propotional fairness _ leads to an _ airtime - fairness _",
    ", where equal airtime usage is provided to all stas",
    ". moreover , in a multi - ap wlan , @xcite study sta - ap association problem with an objective to maximize the proportional fairness .",
    "more precisely , association control is implemented in a form of airtime allocation , where the transmission time of stas at different aps are jointly optimized @xcite .",
    "precise controlling of the sta airtime usage in a 802.11 contention - based wlan is very difficult due to the distributed and random nature of their csma - based mac protocol .",
    "nevertheless , the airtime control algorithms have been proposed in the literature by manipulating the mac parameters @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite discusses how to dynamically modify the cw based on the transmission data rate and estimated packet error rate ( per ) in a wlan aiming to guarantee airtime fairness .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , cw is adjusted according to the traffic load of each sta to improve throughput and fairness in the wlan .",
    "furthermore , @xcite proposes a machine - learning approach to adjust aifs and cw aiming to achieve airtime fairness and reduce frame delay .",
    "such heuristic works provide pretty good understanding of the influence of specific mac parameters such as cw and aifs on the transmission probability and thus airtime usage of the stas .",
    "however , the discussions are limited to adjusting the parameters separately and thus can only find a suboptimal solution in a subset of the feasibility region .    in a virtualized wlan serving multiple isps ,",
    "sta - ap association and airtime control become more challenging .",
    "the reason is that fairness guarantees and service customization are required for isps , while there are unavoidable couplings among the sta transmissions of different isps in the network .",
    "there are a few works addressing only airtime control in the literature . considering a virtualized single - cell wlan , in @xcite ,",
    "a heuristic airtime control algorithm is proposed to achieve the target airtime usage for each isp by controlling the minimum cw of each sta .",
    "similarly , @xcite addresses optimizing cw using control theory . but , as the discussion is limited to controlling minimum cw , the optimality of the result might be sacrificed . in a multi - cell wlan",
    ", @xcite presents an analysis on the feasibility region of isp airtimes and characterizes the isp airtimes at the rate region boundary .",
    "furthermore , a distributed algorithm is developed to allocate airtime slices among isps and flow rates within each slice in a max - min fair manner .",
    "since max - min fairness is used as an objective for rate allocation among the flows in each isp , the optimality of the achieved total throughput may not be guaranteed in a multi - rate wlan .",
    "in addition , the association control is not discussed in @xcite .      to implement the optimal sta - ap association and airtime allocation , it is desirable to control the transmission probability of each sta .",
    "however , in a csma / ca - based wlan , the only controllable parameters are the mac layer parameters .",
    "thus , it is essential to mathematically model the effects of such parameters on the transmission probabilities of stas .",
    "the edca modeling has received considerable attention in the literature .",
    "there are several studies , such as @xcite , that only focus on numerically solving the stationary state ( transmission probability of each sta ) given the network configuration .",
    "another group of works , e.g. , @xcite , provide models for the edca protocol with the help of a markov chain , inspired by the classical work of bianchi @xcite . using such markov chain models , it is possible to optimize the network by tuning the edca parameters .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the proposed edca models , it is hard to establish an explicit relationship between the transmission probabilities and the controllable edca parameters .",
    "thus , these works mostly provide a numerical ( e.g. , @xcite ) or approximate analytical solution in terms of mac parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", none of these works has jointly controlled the edca parameters .",
    "our proposed markov chain model is based on @xcite , with which an explicit relationship between the transmission probability and edca mac parameters can be established .",
    "one limitation of the edca model proposed in @xcite is the accuracy of aifs differentiation . unlike in dcf ,",
    "the time duration each sta has to wait before its backoff process ( i.e. aifs ) is different in edca .",
    "this can lead to the result that the number of contending stas is not time - homogeneous @xcite .",
    "therefore , the collision probability that each sta faces is also not time - homogeneous .",
    "but , as pointed out in @xcite , time - homogeneity assumption greatly simplifies the modeling complexity , and thus , the steady state performance can be characterized as explicit functions of backoff parameters .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of such model can be effectively improved by setting a relatively large initial cw .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section - system - model ] presents an overview of the system configuration and modeling . in section [ section - optimization - problem ] ,",
    "we first analyze the feasibility region of the transmission probabilities based on the proposed markov chain model for ieee edca .",
    "then , we formulate the transmission probability optimization problem , which maximizes the system throughput and guarantees the fairness among the isps . in section [ section : implementation - and - numerical - result ] , the implementation details of mac parameter control are discussed in order to achieve the optimal transmission probability .",
    "illustrative results are provided in section [ section : illustrative - results ] to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithms .",
    "section [ section : conclusion ] provides some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an ieee 802.11-based wlan that consists of a large number of aps .",
    "aps operate on non - overlapping frequency channels .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of aps and @xmath1 be the total number of aps .",
    "each ap has a limited coverage area and all stas are randomly distributed in the field .",
    "the network carries traffic belonging to a number of different isps ( also referred to as v - wlans ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of isps using the network .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath3 be the set of stas of isp @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the number of stas belong to isp @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath7 be the set of all stas and @xmath8 be the total number of stas in the network .",
    "the network is administratively virtualized , i.e. , each ap will broadcast multiple different ssids , one for each isp .",
    "figure [ fig : layered - system - model ] illustrates an example of the network architecture with four physical aps and two isps .      to access the channel ,",
    "the stas are assumed to follow the edca mac protocol of 802.11e standard .",
    "edca protocol is designed to enhance the basic mac mechanism , i.e. , distributed coordination function ( dcf ) , aiming to support service differentiation .",
    "similar to dcf , edca is also a contention - based access scheme , based on csma / ca using binary exponential backoff rules to manage retransmission of collided packets .",
    "here , we briefly review the edca operation , as standardized by 802.11 protocol @xcite .",
    "edca requires a sta to monitor the channel before any transmission .",
    "if the channel is sensed idle for a time interval equal to an arbitration inter - frame space ( aifs ) , the sta transmits .",
    "otherwise , if the sta senses a transmission either immediately or during the aifs , it continues monitoring the channel . when the channel is measured idle for an aifs , the sta backoffs for a random period of time .",
    "edca uses a discrete - time backoff mechanism , i.e. , the time following an aifs is slotted .",
    "the backoff time is selected according to a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath9 $ ] where @xmath10 represents the contention window of sta @xmath11@xcite .",
    "sta @xmath12 starts a packet transmission at backoff stage 0 , where @xmath10 is set equal to the minimum contention window size @xmath13 .",
    "then , after each unsuccessful transmission , sta @xmath12 moves to the next backoff stage and doubles @xmath10 .",
    "when the maximum backoff stage @xmath14 is reached , @xmath10 is no longer increased and stays at @xmath15 . if the sta experiences a collision at the backoff stage @xmath14 , it will retry transmission for at most @xmath16 times , where @xmath16 is the retransmission limit at the maximum backoff stage .",
    "if the packet is still not successfully transmitted after @xmath16 retransmissions , it will be discarded @xcite .",
    "the backoff time counter is decremented and a sta transmits when the backoff counter reaches zero .",
    "if the data frame is successfully received , the ap waits for a period of time called short inter - frame space ( sifs ) and then sends an acknowledgment ( ack ) .",
    "once the channel is sensed busy while counting down , the sta will freeze its backoff counter and continue decrementing when channel finds idle again .",
    "figure [ fig:802.11e ] illustrates an example of the channel - access procedure of two stas using edca @xcite .",
    "edca allows to have variable waiting times and contention parameters ( i.e. , aifs and @xmath17 ) to enable service differentiation . using edca , for each transmission opportunity",
    ", a sta can transmit multiple back - to - back packets for a fixed period of time .",
    "let @xmath18 be the duration of a data frame .",
    "then , the duration of a successful transmission becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the transmission delay .",
    "similarly , the duration of a collision can be calculated as @xmath21     note that when the colliding stas use different aifs values , the aifs value in ( [ t_c_definition ] ) should take the value of the largest aifs .",
    "but , since the fixed transmission duration @xmath22 ( in the order of @xmath23 ) is much larger than aifs in the order of @xmath24 , the difference between the aifs can be ignored here .      in a wlan with aps",
    "densely deployed , stas need to determine which aps to connect with .",
    "we aim to generalize the association control problem by adjusting the transmission probability of each sta at any ap , rather than selecting one ap to associate with .",
    "thus , we define @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) as the probability that sta @xmath12 attempts to transmit at ap @xmath27 in a general time - slot . consequently , the probability that a time - slot is idle in the bss including ap @xmath27 is @xmath28 in a given bss , transmitted packets will be received successfully , if exactly one sta transmits on the channel .",
    "thus , the probability of a successful transmission initiated by sta @xmath12 becomes @xmath29 since @xmath30 and @xmath31 are relatively small ( in the order of @xmath32 ) compared with @xmath18 ( in the order of @xmath33 ) , we approximate @xmath34 and @xmath35 to be of the same size and denote them by @xmath36 . consequently , the expected length of a general time - slot becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the duration of an idle time - slot .",
    "furthermore , the expected information ( in bits ) transmitted by sta @xmath12 to ap @xmath27 in a general time - slot can be derived as @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the transmission data rate of the link between sta @xmath12 and ap @xmath27 . as defined in @xcite , based on the ( [ eq : etg ] ) and ( [ eq : eig ] )",
    ", the throughput of sta @xmath12 at ap @xmath27 becomes @xmath41 let define a new variable @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , which represents the expected number of consecutive transmission attempts by sta @xmath12 at ap @xmath27 as @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath44 and @xmath45 will be transformed into @xmath46 @xmath47 subsequently , from ( [ eq : pidle ] ) and ( [ eq : psucc ] ) , @xmath48 can be represented in terms of @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in addition to the throughput of each sta , the fraction of time that each sta spends for transmission could be considered as another performance metric , specifically in order to measure and preserve fairness among different stas or isps .",
    "the total access airtime for sta @xmath12including both successful transmissions and collisions  becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] is the probability that sta @xmath12 suffers from a collision in a general time - slot as defined in @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath55 in this work , we aim to maximize the overall network throughput , while guaranteeing a minimum requirement on the aggregate airtime of each isp . to this end ,",
    "the transmission probability of stas ( @xmath25 ) need to be adaptively optimized by maximizing the aggregate throughput of all stas at all aps ( i.e.,@xmath56 ) .",
    "furthermore , for each isp ( e.g. , isp @xmath6 ) , a constraint needs to be set in order to keep the total airtime of all stas belonging to isp @xmath6 larger than a minimum requirement .",
    "more specifically , @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the target share of the airtime for isp @xmath6 .     accordingly , to formulate such optimization problem , the feasibility region of @xmath25 ( or @xmath59 ) is required .",
    "thus , we study the behavior of a single sta -which is using edca- with a three - dimensional markov chain . with the aid of the proposed markov model",
    ", we can learn how to implement or control @xmath25 in terms of edca parameters . as a result , based on the established relationship between @xmath25 and edca parameters",
    ", we would be able to analyze its feasibility region and also design an algorithm to control edca parameters to approach the optimal @xmath25 .",

    "in this section , we present the sta - ap association and airtime control optimization problem based on the system model introduced in section [ section - system - model ] .",
    "we first use a markov chain model to model the edca protocol . with this model",
    ", we can analyze the feasibility region of @xmath25 for each sta .",
    "then , the optimization problem is formed and solved by applying monomial approximation and geometric programming .          to study the feasibility region of @xmath25 and its implementation in the edca mac protocol , we establish a three - dimensional markov chain",
    ". such model enables us to estimate the transmission probability of the stas in a wlan employing the edca protocol .",
    "different from the previous works , which discuss a single parameter in the edca protocol ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we aim at developing a general mathematical model that can show the influences of all the edca parameters on the transmission probability .",
    "figure [ fig : markov - chain ] shows the three - dimensional markov chain model to describe the behavior of a single sta , which uses the edca mac protocol . since sta transmissions are only coupled within a bss , we consider a single bss where an ap and its associated stas reside in .",
    "thus , in this subsection without loss of generality , we remove the index of @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath61 ) to keep the notation simple .",
    "our proposed three - dimensional markov chain model is an extension to the presented model in @xcite . to be able to further control the competition among stas and thus the collision probability in a bss , we introduce two new mac parameters ( i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for sta @xmath12 ) for each sta . similar to @xcite , after a successful transmission or a packet drop , the sta has to flip a biased coin with successful probability @xmath62 to enter the backoff process .",
    "whenever the sta fails to enter the backoff process , it needs to wait for a period of long inter - frame space ( i.e. , @xmath63 time - slots ) before another try .",
    "these two variables are incorporated in the proposed markov chain .",
    "it should be noted that time in this markov chain is slotted and the interval between any two adjacent states is a general time - slot . here , a general time - slot can be an idle time - slot @xmath38 , a successful transmission duration ( @xmath34 ) or a collision duration ( @xmath35 ) . in this markov chain ,",
    "the triple @xmath64 denotes the state of the sta at time @xmath65 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath66 represents the backoff / retransmission stage of sta , where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 will be explained later ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath69 denotes the backoff counter , which takes a value between @xmath70 and the contention window of the current backoff stage .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 represents the remaining time of a frozen period or the waiting time to the next trial when the sta already failed to enter the backoff process .",
    "the detailed transition probabilities between states of the markov chain and the stationary condition of the markov chain can be found in the appendix . with such stationary conditions ,",
    "the transmission probability @xmath72 of each sta is derived as function of the detailed edca parameters as in ( [ tau_in_variables ] ) , where @xmath73 is the collision probability faced by sta @xmath12 as defined in ( [ eq : pi ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the feasibility region of @xmath25 in order to complete the optimization problem formulation . based on ( [ tau_in_variables ] ) , the adjustable variables to tune @xmath25 are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
