    "hundreds of supernovae ( sne ) are discovered each year at optical wavelengths by dedicated surveys which focus on nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite their high frequency , these sne are too distant to resolve the sn ejecta and the immediate surroundings of the exploded stars .",
    "fortunately , supernova remnants ( snrs ) offer a complementary means to study sn explosions and dynamics up close and in detail .",
    "currently , @xmath2350 snrs have been identified in the milky way ( mw ) and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) through multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the morphologies and spectral characteristics of these snrs provide crucial insights regarding the nature of sn explosions , the environments of progenitors , and the interactions of massive stars and their circumstellar media ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , study of snrs will aid in addressing two outstanding issues in the literature : the progenitors of type ia sne and the triggering mechanism of jet - driven explosions .    regarding the former topic , it is currently debated whether the progenitor of type ia sne is a single white dwarf accreting from a non - degenerate companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the merger of a double white - dwarf system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nearby type ia snrs can be investigated for clues regarding the nature of the progenitors , including searches for a surviving non - degenerate companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) and evidence of a circumstellar medium modified by a non - degenerate companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , many mysteries remain regarding the nature of jet - driven sne .",
    "jet - driven core - collapse ( cc ) sne are thought to occur among @xmath212% of type ib / c sne @xcite , and some fraction of these events are associated with long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , @xcite ) . as grbs are typically detected at cosmological distances ( see review by @xcite ) , identification of local analogues among the nearby snr population would help constrain the physics , dynamics , and nucleosynthesis of these explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was reported that snr  0104@xmath072.3  in the smc may be the remnant of an unusual type ia explosion @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors showed that modeling of x - ray spectra from snr  0104@xmath072.3  required an overabundance of iron , consistent with a type ia origin for this snr .",
    "as this source is also associated with a nearby star - forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , lee et al . concluded that the progenitor of snr  0104@xmath072.3  may have been a white dwarf from a young population of stars , i.e. from a `` prompt '' type ia sn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to further investigate the unusual nature of this snr , in this paper we take advantage of serendipitous observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. due to its close proximity ( @xmath211 ) to the _ chandra _ calibration source snr  e0102@xmath072.3 , snr  0104@xmath072.3  has been observed regularly throughout the lifetime of _",
    "chandra_. when combined , these data are nearly five times deeper than the targeted _ chandra _ observations presented by @xcite . using these data , we present evidence that the snr actually arose from a jet - driven cc sn . in section  [ sec : data ]",
    ", we detail the archival observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  and how we merged these data . in section  [ sec : results ] , we utilize these combined data to explore the explosive origin of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , based on its morphology ( section  [ sec : morphology ] ) and its metal abundances ( section  [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "we present a discussion and conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , with emphasis on the implication of finding a jet - driven cc snr in the low - metallicity smc .",
    "we identified the available _ chandra _ imaging of snr  0104@xmath072.3  using the following procedure .",
    "first , we searched the _",
    "chandra _ archive for acis - i and observations within 20  of snr  0104@xmath072.3  without gratings and in timed - exposure mode .",
    "this query yielded 242 observations : 237 calibration observations of snr  e0102@xmath072.3 , as well as pointed observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  ( obsids 9100 and 9810 ) , of the nearby snr  0103@xmath072.6 ( obsid 2758 ) , and of the smc wing ( obsids 5485 and 5486 ) .",
    "then , we visually inspected the 242 observations to identify all those where the entirety of snr  0104@xmath072.3  was imaged by an acis chip , regardless of off - axis distance . using this strategy",
    ", we found 56 acis - i and acis - s observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  from 20002009 , with a combined integration of 528.6  ks .",
    "these observations are listed in table  [ table : obs ] along with relevant details for each pointing , including the acis chip on which snr  0104@xmath072.3  is located , the off - axis distance of snr  0104@xmath072.3  to the aim point , and the net ( background - subtracted ) full - band ( 0.58.0 kev ) counts obtained .",
    "the median off - axis distance of snr  0104@xmath072.3  in the 56 observations is 10 . for reference , at 1.49 kev ,",

    "recently , we have developed techniques to quantify the morphological properties of snrs @xcite .",
    "we have applied these methods to archival _ chandra _ and _ spitzer space telescope",
    "_ images of young , ejecta - dominated snrs ( @xmath525000 years old ) to measure the asymmetry of their thermal x - ray and warm dust emission @xcite . in these works",
    ", we found that the x - ray and ir morphology of snrs can be used to differentiate type ia and cc snrs .",
    "in particular , the thermal x - ray and ir emission of type ia snrs are statistically more circular and mirror symmetric than that of cc snrs .",
    "these results can be attributed to both the distinct geometries of the respective explosion mechanisms as well as the different circumstellar environments of type ia and cc sne .    here",
    ", we apply the same symmetry technique as used previously , the power - ratio method ( prm ) , to the merged _ chandra _ soft - band ( 0.52.1 kev ) image of snr  0104@xmath072.3 .",
    "qualitatively , the morphology of snr  0104@xmath072.3  appears bipolar in nature , but statistical comparison to a large sample of young snrs reveals its distinctive nature . in this paper , we give a short overview of the prm , and we refer the reader to our previous papers for the relevant background and equations .",
    "the prm quantifies asymmetries via calculation of the multipole moments @xmath6 of emission in a circular aperture .",
    "it is derived similarly to the expansion of a two - dimensional gravitational potential , except an image s surface brightness replaces the mass surface density .",
    "the powers @xmath7 are obtained by integrating the magnitude of each term @xmath6 over the aperture radius @xmath8 .",
    "we divide the powers @xmath7 by @xmath9 ( the first term of the expansion ) to normalize with respect to flux , and we set the origin position of our aperture to the centroid of the image so that the dipole power ratio @xmath10 approaches zero . in this case , the higher - order terms reflect the asymmetries at successively smaller scales .",
    "we focus on the two ratios in particular : the quadrupole power ratio @xmath11 , which characterizes the ellipticity or elongation of a source , and the octupole power ratio @xmath12 , which quantifies the mirror asymmetry of a source .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the power ratios of snr  0104@xmath072.3  using a monte carlo approach . the soft - band image of snr  0104@xmath072.3  was adaptively binned using the _ adaptivebin _ software @xcite to smooth out noise .",
    "subsequently , noise was added back by taking each adaptive pixel s intensity as the mean of a poisson distribution and selecting a new intensity from that distribution .",
    "this process was repeated 100 times to produce 100 soft - band images of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , and the 1@xmath13 confidence limits on @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given by the sixteenth highest and lowest power ratios derived from the 100 images .    72.3  ( plotted in green ) compared to 24 galactic and lmc snrs ( adapted from figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the quadrupole power ratio @xmath11 measures ellipticity / elongation ; the octupole power ratio @xmath12 quantifies mirror asymmetry .",
    "type ia snrs are plotted in red , and the cc snrs are in blue ( based on their ejecta abundance ratios ) .",
    "one source , snr  0548@xmath070.4 , is in purple because of its anomalous abundance ratios .",
    "snr  0104@xmath072.3  falls in the cc regime of the diagram .",
    "furthermore , it is the most elliptical and mirror asymmetric of the sample , indicative of a complex environment and/or a highly bipolar explosion . ]",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] plots the resulting quadrupole power ratio @xmath11 versus octupole power ratio @xmath12 for snr  0104@xmath072.3  compared to the values obtained for 24 galactic and lmc snrs published in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "snr  0104@xmath072.3  falls in the cc snr regime of the diagram , and it is the most elliptical and mirror asymmetric of all the sources , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the x - ray morphology of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is suggestive of a cc explosive origin .",
    "moreover , recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that the x - ray morphologies of jet - driven cc snrs retain their bipolar structures over many hundreds of years @xcite .",
    "thus , the extreme elongation and asymmetry of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is consistent with a bipolar , jet - driven cc origin .      for our spectral analyses of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , we extracted source and background spectra individually from each of the 56 acis observations using the ciao command _",
    "specextract_. the regions of extraction are shown in figure  [ fig : fullband ] ( right panel ) , including two source regions ( the `` bar '' in red and the `` arc '' in blue ) and an annulus region around snr  0104@xmath072.3  ( in black ) used for the background .",
    "we began by replicating the modeling of @xcite on their two pointed acis - s observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  ( obsids 9100 and 9810 ) .",

    "all uncertainties listed below are 90% confidence ranges for the given parameters .",
    "we extracted spectra from the same two regions as lee et al .",
    "( the bar and the arc ) , and we modeled the spectra as a single absorbed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma using the plane - parallel shock model _",
    "vpshock _ in xspec @xcite .",

    "we began fitting with @xmath17 , the plasma temperature , and normalization thawed , and with all the metals of @xmath17 and the nei plasma frozen to smc ism abundances .",
    "as in lee et al . , these fits produced large residuals in the 0.81.2 kev range . in this band , ne k and fe l lines are prominent , so we subsequently freed both of these parameters and refit the data .    using this approach",

    "the results were similar whether we adopted @xcite or @xcite for solar abundances .",

    "results in the rest of this paper as stemming from the incorrectly adopted smc abundances . in all analyses below",

    "the bar fit did not improve statistically with a thawed si abundance , so we left it frozen to the smc ism abundance of 0.30 solar by number .",
    "the best - fit parameter values from the spectral modeling of the 56 observations ( listed in table  [ table : spectraresults ] ) are consistent within the uncertainties of those derived from just the 110  ks targeted observations ( given in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the addition of the serendipitous data yields smaller error bars on all of the parameters , most notably on the ne , si , and fe abundances . in the arc , the uncertainties are small enough to exclude an ism origin with @xmath4499% confidence for the ne , fe , and si , suggesting these metals are ejecta material . in the bar ,",
    "we also find statistically significant enhancement of ne and fe .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the o abundance in the bar and arc , but we are unable to set useful constraints or upper limits on the o abundance due to absorption toward snr  0104@xmath072.3 .",
    "we note some caveats about the above spectral analyses .",
    "we have combined spectra from 56 observations using the ciao command _ combine_spectra _ , which co - adds imaging source and background spectra as well as instrument response files . to limit systematics ,",
    "we have used the same source and background regions between observations .",
    "however , the different background rates between observations , dependent on which chip snr  0104@xmath072.3  falls and the off - axis distance during each observation , causes some observations to be weighted more than others . in this procedure , the two acis - s3 observations totaling 110 ks would be weighted most heavily , yielding results similar to those derived by the two observations alone , but with smaller error bars . furthermore , although simultaneous fitting of the individual 56 spectra would seem optimal , in practice the procedure gave unphysical results ( e.g. , temperatures @xmath210 kev ) as the fits found local minima of chi - squared space .",
    "in addition to the morphological evidence that snr  0104@xmath072.3  was a jet - driven cc explosion , we can further constrain the explosive origin by comparing the ejecta abundances derived from the arc and bar to those predicted by sn models . recall",
    "the above abundances are by number relative to solar . converting the abundance ratios to be relative to mass and propagating the uncertainties , we have for the bar and and for the arc . by comparison ,",
    "type ia sne produce much less ne than we find in snr  0104@xmath072.3 : the chemical yield of type ia sn models is ne / fe @xmath20.006 in the deflagration case ( model w7 of @xcite ) or ne / fe @xmath20.001 in the delayed detonation case ( model wdd2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the massive progenitors of cc sne produce several orders of magnitude more ne than type ia sne , and thus they are more consistent with our measured ejecta abundances .",
    "in particular , the ne / fe ratio of the spherical cc models of @xcite increases with progenitor mass , from ne / fe @xmath21.8 for a progenitor to ne / fe @xmath225 for a 40 @xmath1 progenitor ( for a 1/5 solar metallicity star ) .",
    "figure  [ abundmodels ] shows graphically how our results compare to the values given by the models .",
    "the ne / fe ratios of the arc and bar of snr  0104@xmath072.3  are most similar to the model predictions of the 1820 @xmath1 progenitors , which have ne / fe @xmath22.3 and @xmath23.7 , respectively .",
    "our si / fe from the arc is also consistent with a 1820 @xmath1 progenitor , as the spherical cc model gives si / fe @xmath21.01.7 .",
    "given the elliptical / elongated morphology of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , we also compare the abundance results to model predictions of aspherical cc sne .",
    "@xcite predict ne / fe ratios similar to those we obtain in the arc and bar , ranging from ne / fe@xmath247 in their aspherical models of 25 @xmath1 and 40 @xmath1 progenitors ( their models 25a , 25b , 40a , and 40b ) .",
    "however , the si / fe of the arc is below the yields of the aspherical 40 @xmath1 models ( which give si / fe @xmath22.1 ) .",
    "thus , our best - fit abundances are most consistent with either a spherical cc sn of a 1820 @xmath1 progenitor or an aspherical cc sn of a 25 @xmath1 progenitor .",
    "of these two possible progenitors , we favor an aspherical explosion scenario for snr  0104@xmath072.3  due to its highly elliptical morphology .",
    "we also emphasize that hydrodynamical modeling of sne has only sampled a small subset of the parameter space that can affect nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , jet opening angles , explosion energy , progenitor mass and metallicity ) . as such , our constraints on the progenitor mass from the metal abundances should be interpreted as approximate rather than as strict limits .    here",
    ", we have assumed that all of the ejecta has been shock - heated and is well mixed , and thus , the best - fit abundances reflect the nucleosynthetic yield of the sn explosion .",
    "we can justify this assumption based on the age @xmath45 of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , using the sedov - taylor solution :      the diameter of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is @xmath21.8 , corresponding to @xmath4716 pc , assuming a distance of 61 kpc to the smc @xcite .",
    "given this radius , the approximate age of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is @xmath48 17600 years , for an explosion of energy @xmath49 erg in an ambient electron density of @xmath50 @xmath21 . at this relatively evolved stage",
    ", the reverse shock would have completed its propagation inward relative to the ejecta ( see @xcite ) , heating the ejecta to x - ray emitting temperatures .    in this paper , we have employed 528.6 ks of serendipitous _",
    "chandra _ observations to reconsider the explosive origin of the smc snr  0104@xmath072.3 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the x - ray morphology of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is extremely elliptical / elongated compared to other young snrs in the mw and the lmc , suggesting it is the result of a core - collapse sn .",
    "furthermore , we have performed spectral modeling of two regions of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , and we have found enhanced abundances of ne , si , and fe . through comparison to the nucleosynthesis predictions of type ia and cc sn models ,",
    "we demonstrate that the yields are consistent with either a spherical cc sn of a 1820 @xmath1 progenitor or an aspherical cc sn of a 25 @xmath1 progenitor .",
    "given the bipolar morphology of the snr , we consider the latter scenario to be more likely , in which case it would be the second snr likely to have had a bipolar origin ( the first being w49b in the mw : @xcite ) .    as a consistency check on the nature of snr  0104@xmath072.3",
    ", we investigate the star formation history ( sfh ) at the site of snr  0104@xmath072.3  using the spatially - resolved sfh maps of the smc produced by @xcite .",
    "these authors obtained _ ubvi _ photometry of 6 million stars across the smc and produced a uniform grid of 12@xmath5112  regions , each with its own sfh derived from starfish @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a plot of the star formation rate ( sfr ) versus age obtained by harris & zaritsky at the location of snr  0104@xmath072.3 .",
    "the peak sfr occurred at @xmath27 myr ago for a metallicity @xmath52 or at @xmath215 myr ago for @xmath53 .",
    "these ages correspond to stars of zero - age main sequence mass @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively , using the single star models of @xcite .",
    "thus , the sfh at the site of snr  0104@xmath072.3   particularly that of the low - metallicity case  gives the appropriate age for a massive star ( @xmath22540 @xmath1 ) origin of snr  0104@xmath072.3 .",
    "although the averaged sfhs derived from resolved stellar populations can be misleading regarding sn progenitors ( especially for type ia snrs ; see the discussion of @xcite ) , this approach provides a complementary means to verify our results .",
    "and @xmath56 ) at the site of snr  0104@xmath072.3 , taken from the star - formation history ( sfh ) maps of the smc produced by @xcite .",
    "the solid lines represent the best - fit sfr reported by @xcite , and the shaded regions give their 68% confidence limits . at the top of the figure , we mark the time @xmath57 when the progenitor star of a given zero - age main sequence mass @xmath58 would have formed ( using the single star models of @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the peak sfr occurred at @xmath27 myr ago for a metallicity @xmath52 or at @xmath215 myr ago for @xmath53 .",
    "these ages correspond to progenitor stars of mass @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "thus , the sfh at the site of snr  0104@xmath072.3  is also suggestive of a cc origin of this snr . ]",
    "the identification of a bipolar snr in the smc is remarkable given that only @xmath225 snrs are known in the smc @xcite . by comparison",
    ", only one snr in the mw has been shown to be bipolar to date @xcite out of @xmath2300 snrs @xcite , an order of magnitude larger sample .",
    "yet if the sn rate is proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy , then the number of bipolar sne in the mw should be a factor of 20 _ greater _ than the smc ( assuming a sfr of @xmath21 @xmath1 year@xmath59 in the mw and of @xmath20.05 @xmath1 year@xmath59 in the smc ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a bipolar snr in the smc may suggest that jet - driven explosions may occur more commonly in the smc , a low metallicity galaxy ( with @xmath20.2 @xmath60 : @xcite ) .",
    "if bipolar sne happened at the same rate in the mw and smc , we would expect to have @xmath212 bipolar snrs out of the 300 in our galaxy .",
    "while no other mw snrs currently show evidence of bipolarity ( based on e.g. , morphology , abundances , and star - formation histories : @xcite ) , a full statistical analysis is necessary to demonstrate definitively that bipolar sne are more likely in the smc compared to the mw .",
    "if this result holds , it is consistent with recent work showing bipolar sne prefer low - metallicity environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) , since rapid rotation without extensive mass loss is required to produce these explosions .",
    "in particular , broad - line ( bl ) type ic sne ( which are thought to be jet - driven explosions ) are observed to occur at lower median metallicity than typical type ib / c sne @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at sufficiently low metallicity ( @xmath20.20.6 @xmath60 ) , bl - ic sne are associated with long - duration grbs @xcite , and 75% of long grbs are located in host galaxies with @xmath50.5 @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "our findings would support this framework of jet - driven explosions happening more frequently at low metallicity .    in the future ,",
    "astro - h observations of snr  0104@xmath072.3  will be able to differentiate the ne and fe l emission lines that comprise the bump in the x - ray spectra at 0.91.1 kev , facilitating tighter constraints on the relative abundances of the two elements .",
    "although the distance to the smc would preclude the x - ray detection of a thermal emission from any central compact object , non - thermal emission or pulsations may be observable if the snr has a pulsar .",
