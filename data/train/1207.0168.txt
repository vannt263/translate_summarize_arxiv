    "<S> bell - state analysis ( bsa ) is essential in quantum communication , but it is impossible to distinguish unambiguously the four bell states in the polarization degree of freedom ( dof ) of two - photon systems with only linear optical elements , except for the case in which the bsa is assisted with hyperentangled states , the simultaneous entanglement in more than one dof . here , we propose a scheme to distinguish completely the 16 hyperentangled bell states in both the polarization and the spatial - mode dofs of two - photon systems , by using the giant nonlinear optics in quantum dot - cavity systems . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme can be applied to increase the channel capacity of long - distance quantum communication based on hyperentanglement , such as entanglement swapping , teleportation , and superdense coding . </S>",
    "<S> we use hyperentanglement swapping as an example to show the application of this hbsa . </S>"
