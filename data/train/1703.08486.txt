    "escape of a particle confined in a metastable state is a ubiquitous problem arising in domains varying from chemical kinetics to transport theory .",
    "the theory of brownian motion provides one of the most elegant approaches to study the problem by identifying the additional degrees of freedom as noise and friction @xcite .",
    "this approach towards the escape problem was grounded in the seminal work of kramers @xcite , who provided theoretical estimates for the rate of escape for a particle trapped in a metastable state in the limits of low and high friction .",
    "generalizing the single particle problem , thermally activated escape of extended objects like polymers has attracted attention in recent times @xcite .",
    "the studies have concluded that the escape of a polymer chain from a potential well depends nontrivially on the structural properties of the polymer , viz . the number of monomers constituting the chain and the strength of inter - particle interactions .",
    "the results provide a handle to control the rates of chemical reactions involving polymers by varying their structural parameters .",
    "recently the problem of a dimer crossing a potential barrier has been investigated @xcite conforming with the previous results for polymers .",
    "however , all these studies have focused on uncorrelated noise processes , whereas it is known that noises from identical origin are generally correlated @xcite .",
    "such correlations significantly affect the dynamics of a particle in a bistable potential @xcite , and are known to induce nonzero transport in periodic potentials due to symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the observations motivate us to study the effect of noise correlations on the dynamics of extended objects .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of the simplest extended object , a dimer : two harmonically coupled brownian particles in a piecewise linear bistable potential .",
    "additional thermal degrees of freedom are gaussian white and correlated with each other .",
    "it is found that positively correlated noise processes facilitate barrier crossing for the dimer whereas negative correlations tend to diminish the effect of thermal degrees of freedom .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section the effect of coupling and correlation are studied on the motion of the dimer .",
    "following it the strong coupling limit of the dynamics is analyzed and the effects of periodic forcing are also reported .",
    "the results are generalized to the dynamics of a polymer in a potential field with conclusions in the final section .",
    "let us start with the dynamical equations for a dimer in a bistable potential @xmath0 :    [ dyn ] @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are gaussian white noises of mean zero and correlations :    [ corr ] @xmath4    with @xmath5 being the noise intensity and @xmath6 $ ] the measure of correlation .",
    "the noise intensity is a measure of the dimensionless temperature of the associated heat bath .",
    "consequently , the existence of a correlation between the two noise processes is natural as @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the same thermal origin .",

    "it is observed that @xmath31 decreases with increasing correlation @xmath26 .",
    "the reason for such a behavior follows from the dynamical equations in ( [ dyn_cm ] ) and ( [ cm_corr ] ) which imply that the noise intensity affecting the dynamics of the center of mass is @xmath39 . as a result , for negative values of @xmath26 the center of mass does not feel the additive perturbations to the extent as felt in the absence of any correlations .",
    "consequently , the escape to the absorbing boundary becomes difficult for negative values of @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath40 enhances the effect of the thermal degrees of freedom , making the transport of the dimer across the well relatively easier .",
    "the results detail us with the dynamical properties of coupled brownian particles for different values of spring constant @xmath14 and noise correlation @xmath26 .",
    "it is also inferred from the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the mean escape time @xmath31 is lowest when the two monomers move relatively independent of each other , i.e. , for low values of spring constant @xmath14",
    ". the overall effect of coupling is to slow down the escape process and it is in this limit that the noise correlations play a significant role .",
    "consequently , it becomes interesting to study the limit of large coupling constant in which the dimer moves effectively as a single particle at its center of mass and we proceed with this in the next section by the method of adiabatic elimination of the fast degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic elimination of the fast variable requires marginalization of the probability distribution @xmath41 via the stationary solution of the fokker - planck operator for the fast variable @xmath19 . the fokker - planck equation associated with the dynamical equations",
    "( [ dyn_cm ] ) and ( [ cm_corr ] ) is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fokker - planck operators associated with the slow @xmath18 and fast @xmath19 degrees of freedom respectively . in the limit of large spring constant @xmath14 , the two harmonically coupled particles experience the same potential , hence @xmath45 . as a result , @xmath46 , which admits the gaussian distribution of mean zero and variance @xmath47 as its stationary solution @xmath48 .",
    "marginalization of @xmath49 using @xmath50 leads to the effective drift term for the center of mass motion in large @xmath14 limit and is given by : @xmath51 where erf is the error function , and approaches @xmath52 due to the smallness of the variance @xmath53 .",
    "hence , in the limit of large spring constant the center of mass motion is equivalent to the motion of a single particle in the potential given by eqn([potential ] ) and with the noise intensity modified to @xmath39 .",
    "such a modification of the noise intensity has strong implications on the dynamics of the coupled brownian particles as shown below .",
    "the effect of noise correlation on the dynamics of the center of mass can be studied using the above result . to investigate the effect ,",
    "let us calculate the mean first passage time @xmath31 of the center of mass starting at @xmath35 to the absorbing boundary at @xmath30 . using the backward fokker - planck operator , the expression for the mean first passage time reads :",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "hence , the rate of escape of the center of mass from the minima of the potential well to the absorbing boundary is @xmath56 , which is of the same form as proposed originally by kramers .",
    "consequently , it becomes nearly impossible for the dimer to escape the potential well for strongly anti - correlated noise processes when the coupling between the two monomers is high .",
    "the strong coupling limit of the dimer motion also allows us to calculate the relaxation time of the initial probability density to its steady state .",
    "we know that in the limit of large spring constant @xmath14 , the dynamics of the center of mass follows : @xmath57 admitting @xmath58 as its steady state probability density .",
    "hence , it becomes interesting to know the timescale on which the initial density @xmath59 relaxes towards the steady state . in order to calculate the relaxation time @xmath60 , define : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the probability distribution associated with the center of mass motion and @xmath63 is the density of the center of mass being found in the basin of attraction of the minima at @xmath36 .",
    "using the results in @xcite it is found that : @xmath64 , where the first term is the contribution of the pole of the laplace transform of @xmath62 and the second term , which is valid only in the limit of long times is the contribution of the branch cut associated with @xmath65 , the laplace transform of @xmath62 . using @xcite , the relaxation time @xmath60 is given by : @xmath66 which is the same as the mean first passage time of the center of mass to the absorbing boundary at the peak .",
    "it is to be noted that the contribution of the branch cut has been ignored in the calculation of the relaxation time @xmath60 , as it is valid only in the long - time limit .",
    "the dependence of @xmath60 on noise correlation @xmath26 implies that the time to approach stationarity can also be controlled by the correlation .",
    "of the dimer from the potential minima to the basin of attraction of the other minima as a function of correlation @xmath26 for different values of noise intensity @xmath5 in the strong coupling limit between the monomers .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the variation of the rate of escape @xmath67 of the dimer as a function of the noise correlation @xmath26 for different values of noise intensity @xmath5 when the coupling between the monomers is very strong .",
    "the monotonic variation of @xmath67 with @xmath26 in the strong coupling limit conforms with numerically observed results for relatively weaker values of @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , as the probability density relaxes towards its stationary value at the same rate as the escape rate , the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also imply that the system may take a very long time to relax to its stationary state when the noise processes are strongly anticorrelated .",
    "this can leave the dimer confined in the potential minima for longer times as compared to independent noise sources and can be employed as a mechanism for confinement . with the transient properties of the dimer motion understood , in the next section let us generalize to the dynamics of a polymer in a confining potential .",
    "the dynamics of a polymer chain in some potential @xmath68 is given by the langevin equation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and the noise processes @xmath71 are gaussian white with mean zero and correlations @xmath72 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix are unity by definition and the off - diagonal elements are symmetric and take values from the interval @xmath73 $ ] , which generalizes the dynamics of a polymer chain with independent noise processes @xcite . the dynamical equations in ( [ polymer ] )",

    "positively correlated noise processes on the other hand aid in the escape with respect to uncorrelated noises .",
    "this can be easily understood in the limit when the coupling between the monomers is chosen to be very strong , adiabatic elimination of the relative coordinates rendering the equation of motion of center of mass : @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the effective potential .",
    "this is equivalent to the dynamics of a single particle in the potential @xmath80 and the thermal degrees of freedom controlled by the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath78 . as a result",
    ", the kramers formula can be used to calculate the rate of escape from a potential minima : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the height of the potential barrier .",
    "the expression generalizes the previously known results for @xmath67 for uncorrelated noise processes @xcite by incorporating noise correlations .",
    "now , for a given value of noise intensity @xmath5 , the correlations @xmath78 can always be chosen such that the term in the brackets : @xmath83 , becomes small enough to drastically reduce the magnitude of thermal fluctuations preventing the polymer to cross the barrier even when the assigned value of @xmath5 is strong enough to drive the barrier crossing process in the absence of noise correlations .",
    "on the other hand , if the correlations are chosen such that @xmath84 for all @xmath85 , then these enhance the magnitude of the thermal fluctuations thereby making the barrier crossing of the polymer more likely in comparison to the case with uncorrelated noises .",
    "this generalizes the results of the previous sections for dimers with correlated noises and has implications towards controlling the rates of chemical reactions involving polymers by varying the correlation between the noise processes .",
    "in summary , the paper discusses the dynamics of harmonically coupled brownian particles in a symmetric , piecewise linear bistable potential under the effect of correlated noise processes .",
    "the main result of the study is that for a fixed value of noise intensity , positively correlated noise processes aid in the escape of the dimer from the metastable states whereas anticorrelated noises tend towards confinement provided the particles are not moving completely independent of each other .",
    "this result has significant implications towards the dynamics of polymers in potential fields , e.g.- the rates of chemical reactions involving polymers can be controlled by varying the noise correlations and if very strongly anti - correlated noises are used , then the polymer can be confined in metastable states for longer periods of time .",
    "alternatively , correlated noise sources can be employed to confine polymers in a metastable state with the amounts of correlation controlling the residence times in the confinement .",
    "the observations also generalize to dynamics of extended objects in potentials with multiple minima , e.g.- transport of a dimer/ polymer in a tilted periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the effects of noise correlations in such potentials would be observed in the variation of current across the potential , with the current reducing for negative correlations and enhanced for positive correlations .",
