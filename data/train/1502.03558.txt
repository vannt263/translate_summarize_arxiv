    "the fundamental physics underlying all these scientific applications is the interaction of an intense electromagnetic ( from now on we shall use the initials em ) field with an electron .",
    "the nature of the interaction is determined by the normalized field amplitude @xmath1 and the quantum parameter @xmath2 the electron mass and charge are denoted by @xmath3 respectively , and its asymptotic momentum ( i.e. the momentum in the absence of the em field ) is @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitude of the vector potential @xmath5 is @xmath6 and the em field tensor is @xmath7 .",
    "natural units are used , namely @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced planck constant and @xmath10 is the speed of light .",
    "if both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are larger than one , the electron dynamics is both quantum and non - linear .",
    "the appropriate framework is the strong - field qed @xcite .",
    "its basic principle is the inclusion of the term corresponding to the interaction with the classical laser field into the free part of the lagrangian . as a consequence ,",
    "the unpertubed states appearing in the cross section calculation are no longer free waves .",
    "instead , they are represented by the solutions of the quantum equation of motion in the presence of the em field .",
    "these wavefunctions were obtained by volkov @xcite , provided that the em field propagates in vacuum .    employing this approach ,",
    "the properties of qed in the nonperturbative regime were thoroughly investigated through the years @xcite .",
    "the lowest order strong - field processes are the non linear compton scattering , where an electron interacts with the laser photons and emits a hard photon and the non - linear breit - wheeler process , where a photon decayes into a positron - electron pair in the presence of the em field @xcite .",
    "a sequential series of these processes , called `` qed cascade '' is followed by a rapid formation of a qed plasma whose ingredients are electrons , positrons and gamma photons @xcite .",
    "besides its fundamental significance , this phenomena attracts scientific attention as a possible laboratory astrophysics settings @xcite and as a potential gamma ray source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that spontaneous cascades impose a limit ( of about @xmath13 ) on the achievable laser intensity @xcite .",
    "the most favorable em field configuration for the generation of a qed cascade is a rotating electric field @xcite .",
    "it can be realized experimentally in the anti - nodes of counter propagating laser beams .",

    "the quantum rates were obtained with the volkov wavefunctions @xcite , though not formally adequate for a rotating electric field .",
    "the underlying assumption ( see p. 3 in @xcite and p. 454 in @xcite ) justifying this technique is that as long as the normalized em field invariants , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are negligible with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , namely @xmath18 the particle dynamic is well described by the volkov wavefunction .",

    "we derive a novel solution to the quantum equation of motion in the presence of a rotating electric field .",
    "the comparison between the volkov wavefunction and our new solution in the relevant parameters range reveals an overwhelming deviation .",
    "consequently , the common theoretical treatment towards the qed cascades has to be revised .",
    "second , the new solution derived below suggests a natural way to obtain the emission rates in the presence of a rotating electric field for the sake of qed cascades calculations .",
    "the particles of interest in the context of qed cascades are fermions ( electrons and positrons ) .",
    "therefore , their wavefunction obeys the dirac equation .",
    "however , the spin effect may be neglected in the typical cascades conditions @xcite .",
    "hence , for the sake of simplicity we shall treat them as scalars .",
