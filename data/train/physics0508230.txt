    "photonic crystal fibres ( pcfs ) , whose cladding is composed of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystal  @xcite , may confine and guide light through either a photonic bandgap effect  @xcite or by an effective high refractive index guiding mechanism  @xcite .",
    "both classes of fibres have been the subject of numerous research and for a review we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the latter class of pcfs has attractive features such as , broad - band single - mode ( sm ) operation  @xcite , possibilities for dispersion engineering  @xcite , and tailorable mode area  @xcite .",
    "the 2d photonic crystal of the cladding not only provides more design freedom on engineering basic properties of the fibre , but also broadens the potential application of pcfs by the freedom to remove more air holes from the cladding  @xcite or by introducing additional materials to the air holes  @xcite , both of which facilitate novel device operations based on pcfs . in the present work ,",
    "the `` pcf device '' term is restricted to the ones obtained by removing some holes from the cladding such as , pcf couplers  @xcite , pcf polarization beam splitters  @xcite , or pcf distributed bragg reflectors  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we describe an approach , which relies on modal transmission - line theory ( mtlt ) , for three - dimensional ( 3d ) investigations of the propagation of an optical beam launched into a pcf device . according to our knowledge only the finite element beam propagation method ( fe - bpm )",
    "@xcite has been adopted and utilized for doing such simulations .",
    "the fe - bpm is numerically robust , versatile , and applicable to a wide variety of structures .",
    "unfortunately , this is often achieved at the expense of long computational times and large memory requirements , both of which can become critical issues especially when structures with large dimensions are considered or when used within an iterative design environment .",
    "+ mtlt , which has been developed for modelling multi - layered periodic media  @xcite , has been used for analysis of distributed feedback ( dfb ) lasers  @xcite , quantum well infrared photodetectors ( qwip )  @xcite , holographic power splitter / combiners  @xcite and grating assisted integrated optics devices  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also successfully been applied in a study of radiation fields from end - facet pcfs  @xcite .",
    "mtlt relies on a plane - wave expansion of electromagnetic fields in the periodic media .",
    "interpreting the plane waves as transmission - lines provides a systematic framework for study of wave propagation in multi - layered periodic media .",
    "besides that , one can exploit all the concepts and methods of transmission - line theory  @xcite and electrical network theory  @xcite for the study of wave propagation .",
    "mtlt has recently been developed for modal analysis of arbitrary shape optical waveguides  @xcite .",
    "here , we add a novel approach to this theory and utilize it for a three - dimensional study of propagation of light in photonic crystal fibre devices .    the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief account of mtlt and describe the approach we use . in section 3",
    "we investigate examples that illustrate the utilization of this approach in the modelling of pcf devices .",

    "we consider non - magnetic materials with relative permeability @xmath5 and all electromagnetic fields have a harmonic temporal dependence , @xmath6 .",
    "pcf devices with the typical shape shown in , usually confine light within the fibre core or cores .",
    "however , some application such as long - period fibre bragg gratings do not share this feature so in the present study we exclude these applications . for the applications with",
    "spatially localized modes we use a super - cell approach and repeat the structure in the transverse @xmath7-plane , along @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions with periodicities of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the periodically repeated devices are separated by a sufficient amount of background region , here microstructured cladding , that their electromagnetic fields do not affect each other significantly .",
    "we want to study a pcf device when it is illuminated with an incident field @xmath12 propagating in layer 1 of the structure shown in .",
    "this incident field is a solution to the source - free maxwell equations in the pcf with the refractive index profile of layer 1 . in this section",
    "we briefly address mtlt and modal analysis of optical waveguides using this theory .",
    "subsequently we describe an approach , based on mtlt , for investigating the scattering and propagation of light in pcf devices . throughout the paper , vectorial components",
