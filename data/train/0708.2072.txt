    "patterns observed in measured spectra have repeatedly inspired fundamental breakthroughs in modeling reality .",
    "the periodic table of the chemical elements led to the construction of the atomic model , and atomic spectroscopy led to the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "later , the categorization of subatomic particles into the geometric patterns of the ` eightfold way ' spawned the creation of the quark model and ultimately , the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is critical to the development of particle physics to determine if qcd gives rise to experimentally observed nuclear physics phenomena .",
    "the qcd spectrum is a particularly desirable calculation not only because it would provide a check of the theory , but also because it could lead to a much deeper understanding of the physics of the strong interaction . additionally , because its underlying quark degrees of freedom are color confined , qcd s low - energy behavior must be inferred from the properties of its composite hadronic resonances .",
    "one of the main goals of the lattice hadron physics collaboration ( lhpc ) is to calculate the qcd hadron spectrum from first principles using the lattice qcd formalism .",
    "such a calculation would shed light on many interesting phenomenological issues such as the nature of the roper resonance , the missing quark model resonances , and the properties of hybrid and exotic hadronic resonances .",
    "in qcd the effective strength of the strong nuclear force is controlled by the renormalized coupling between the quarks and the gluons .",
    "this quantity is dependent on the energy scale of the interaction and becomes weak at high - energies , leading to the property of asymptotic freedom .",
    "this is consistent with the results of deep inelastic scattering experiments involving high momentum transfer interactions . at these scales ,",
    "the application of perturbation theory has led to predictions which agree spectacularly with experiment .",
    "in contrast , the coupling becomes strong at lower energy scales .",
    "this is consistent with color confinement , and leads to a rich spectral structure .",
    "this strong coupling precludes any perturbative expansion ( in the coupling ) for low energy quantities such as the spectrum .",
    "fortunately , non - perturbative calculations are possible using a space - time lattice regulator in conjunction with the functional integral framework  @xcite .",
    "the use of a lattice not only defines a measure for the functional integral , but also introduces an ultraviolet cutoff via the inverse lattice spacing @xmath0 . in the following we survey several key concepts which enable lattice practitioners to calculate the qcd spectrum .",
    "several expository books on lattice qcd are available  @xcite . here",
    "we review those features of the formalism relevant to spectroscopy , using scalar fields for simplicity . in the continuum , quantum fields",

    "the lattice fields are denoted @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the spatial index now restricted to values on a @xmath8-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the discrete index @xmath9 does not represent the standard ( minkowski ) time @xmath3 , but instead denotes imaginary ( euclidean ) time .",
    "the use of euclidean time implies that the collection of fields on one time slice is related to the collection of fields on a neighboring time slice via the _ transfer matrix _ : @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the lattice spacing between neighboring time slices .",

    "the gauge links provide a connection between adjacent sites that maintains color gauge - covariance .",
    "we use a finite temporal extent @xmath18 , and render the number of integrals on each time slice finite by working in a finite periodic spatial volume @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number of temporal and spatial lattice sites , respectively .",
    "the temporal extent @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : partition2 ] is analogous to the inverse temperature in statistical mechanics : @xmath23 and thus the lattice formalism can be used to calculate the qcd equation of state and investigate such systems as the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite . to determine the qcd spectrum , we are interested in the zero - temperature limit of the partition function , and will work with large temporal extents @xmath24",
    "it should be noted that minkowski time does not appear anywhere in this formulation .",
    "this does not cause difficulties because a theory s spectrum is an equilibrium ( i.e. time - independent ) property .",
    "it is possible , however , to define lattice formulations which allow the investigation of non - equilibrium properties of qcd such as transport coefficients  @xcite .      to access the spectrum , we define a _ correlator _",

    "[ fig : meff ] demonstrates two powerful ways to improve signal quality : quark field smearing and gauge link smearing  @xcite .",
    "the smearing process replaces the variables at each location with a suitable form of a weighted local spatial average .",
    "it has been found that quark field smearing drastically reduces the coupling of operators to the short - wavelength contaminating modes of the theory , at the price of a modest increase in noise .",
    "the primary source of noise in an operator , especially in _ extended _ operators using quarks which are covariantly displaced from one another , is the presence of stochastically updated gauge link variables .",
    "the application of link smearing strongly attenuates the noise of the operator .",

    "thus , by diagonalizing @xmath51 it can be shown  @xcite that one is working ( formally ) with the basis of trial states : @xmath52 by relaxing the trial basis , we obtain a better overlap with the subspace spanned by the low - lying states of interest . in practice , this method is complicated by the presence of noise in the estimates of @xmath43 .     anisotropic lattice with @xmath53 fm and @xmath54 .",
