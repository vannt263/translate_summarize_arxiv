    "intermittency is known to be an ubiquitous phenomenon in nonlinear science .",
    "its arousal and main statistical properties have been studied and characterized already since long time ago , and different types of intermittency have been classified as types i  iii  @xcite , on  off intermittency  @xcite , eyelet intermittency  @xcite and ring intermittency  @xcite .    from the other side ,",
    "increasing interest has been put recently in the study of the constructive role of noise and fluctuations in nonlinear dynamical systems . in particular , it was discovered that random fluctuations can actually induce some degree of order in a large variety of nonlinear systems  @xcite , and such phenomena were widely observed in relevant physical , chemical and biological circumstances  @xcite .",
    "there are no doubts that different types of intermittent behavior may take place in the presence of noise and fluctuations in a wide spectrum of systems , including cases of practical interest for applications in radio engineering , medical , physiological and other applied sciences .",
    "it is plausible that such an interaction would originate new types of dynamics .",
    "therefore , the intermittent behavior in the presence of noise has been studied by means of fokker - plank equation  @xcite and adopting renormalization group analysis  @xcite , but the characteristic relations were obtained only in the subcritical region , where the intermittent behavior is observed both in the presence of noise and without noise .",
    "recently  @xcite , the theoretical consideration of the intermittent behavior in the presence of noise has been considered in the supercritical region ( where intermittency is absent in the absence of noise ) , with the analytical form of the dependence of the mean length of the laminar phases versus the critical parameter being deduced under the assumption of the fixed reinjection probability taken in the form of a @xmath0-function .",
    "moreover , the found analytical law has been verified by means of the experimental observation of the characteristic relations of intermittency in the presence of noise  @xcite . at the same time , the other important statistical characteristic of the intermittent behavior , namely , the distribution of the laminar phase lengths , has not been obtained hitherto for the supercritical parameter region .    in this paper",
    "we report for the first time the form of the distribution of the lengths of the laminar phases deduced analytically for the type - i intermittency in the presence of noise for the region of the supercritical parameter values .",
    "the already known dependence of the mean length of the laminar phases on the criticality parameter  @xcite follows as a corollary of the carried out research .",
    "moreover , we prove that this dependence obtained in  @xcite under the assumption of the fixed reinjection probability taken in the form of delta - function does not depend practically on the relaminarization properties , and , correspondingly , the obtained expression of the mean length of the laminar phases on the criticality parameter remains correct for different forms of the reinjection probability .",
    "the obtained analytical distribution of the laminar phase length is verified by means of both numerical calculations of the model system dynamics and experimental observations .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sct : noisedtypeiintermittency ] we describe the theory of the type - i intermittency with noise and give the theoretical predictions for the distributions of the laminar phase length . in sec .",
    "[ sct : samplesystems ] we describe the dynamical systems used to illustrate our conclusions . we show numerically that our theoretical predictions are observed in the different nonlinear systems , including coupled chaotic oscillators near the boundary of the phase synchronization in the case of small detuning of the natural frequencies . finally , in sec .",

    "the standard model that is used to study the type - i intermittency  @xcite is the one - parameter quadratic map @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a control parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath3 corresponds to the saddle - node ( tangential ) bifurcation when the stable and unstable points touch each other in @xmath4 and disappear .    below the critical parameter value ( i.e. , for @xmath5 ) , the stable fixed point",
    "is observed , while above @xmath6 a narrow corridor between the function @xmath7 and the bisector @xmath8 exists , such that the point representing the state of the map  ( [ eq : quadraticmap ] ) moves along it ( fig .",
    "[ fgr : iterationdiagram ] ) .",
    "this movement corresponds to the laminar phase , its mean length @xmath9 being inversely proportional to the square root of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11    to develop the theory of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise , we consider the same quadratic map  ( [ eq : quadraticmap ] ) with the addition of a stochastic term @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath12 is supposed to be a delta - correlated white noise [ @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the influence of the stochastic term @xmath12 on the behavior of the system is governed by the value of parameter @xmath16 . for positive values of the control parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the point corresponding to the behavior of system  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) moves in the iteration diagram along the narrow corridor , its motion being perturbed by the stochastic force . as far as the intensity of the noise is not large , the characteristics of classical type - i intermittency are observed .    )",
    "( _ a _ ) @xmath17 and ( _ b _ ) @xmath18 .",
    "the stable and unstable fixed points of  ( [ eq : quadraticmap ] ) are shown by and , respectively ]    a different scenario occurs for control parameters @xmath2 assuming negative values ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ) . in this case , the point corresponding to the behavior of system  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) is localized for a long time in the region @xmath21 and its dynamics is also perturbed by the stochastic force .",
    "as soon as the system state point arrives at the boundary @xmath22 due to the influence of noise , a turbulent phase arises , though such kind of events is very rare .    in this case , the behavior of the map  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) differs radically from the dynamics of the system  ( [ eq : quadraticmap ] ) , since the turbulent phases are not observed for @xmath18 if there is no noise .",
    "therefore , such a region of negative values of the @xmath2-parameter is the main subject of interest for the type - i intermittency in the presence of noise .",
    "having supposed that : ( i ) the value of @xmath2 is negative and rather small and ( ii ) the value of @xmath23 changes per one iteration insufficiently , we can consider @xmath24 as the time derivative @xmath25 and undergo from the system with discrete time  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) to the flow system , in the same way as in the case of the classical theory of the type - i intermittency .",
    "since the stochastic term is present in  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) we have to examine the stochastic differential equation @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is a stochastic process , @xmath28 a one - dimensional winner process , @xmath29 ) instead of the ordinary differential equation @xmath30 considered in the classical theory of type  i intermittency .",
    "the stochastic differential equation  ( [ eq : sde ] ) is equivalent to the fokker - plank equation @xmath31 for the probability density @xmath32 of the stochastic process @xmath27 .",
    "contrarily to what done in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where the backward fokker - plank equation was used ) , we here consider the forward one that allows us to obtain the explicit form of the distribution of the laminar phase lengths .",
    "the chosen initial condition is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a delta - function .",
    "such choice of the initial form of the probability density @xmath35 corresponds to the beginning of the laminar phase , when the point representing the state of the system  ( [ eq : stochasticquadraticmap ] ) is in the place with coordinate @xmath4 at time @xmath36 . in other words , we suppose that the reinjection probability is a @xmath0-function @xmath37 and after the relaminarization process the system is always returned to the state @xmath4 .",
    "although the reinjection probability @xmath38 is well - known to be important factor and should be taken into account when the statistical properties of the intermittent behavior are studied  @xcite , in the considered problem the form of the reinjection probability practically does not influence on the distribution of the laminar phase lengths ( and the dependence of the mean laminar phase length on the criticality parameter , respectively ) , as it will be shown below .    to reduce the number of the control parameters the normalization @xmath39 ,",

    "( [ eq : fpeminus ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "since the coordinate of the system state is localized for a long time in the region @xmath44 , we suppose that the probability density may be written in the form @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 decreases very slowly as time increases , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath49 should also satisfy the conditions @xmath50    under the mentioned assumption , we consider the ordinary differential equation @xmath51 instead of  ( [ eq : normfpeminus ] ) for the region @xmath52 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to @xmath53 where @xmath54 is constant .",
    "to solve this equation we use the integrating factor @xmath55 the solution of  ( [ eq : odufirstorder ] ) may be found in the form @xmath56 since the obtained @xmath49 satisfies the conditions  ( [ eq : conditionsforp ] ) only if @xmath57 , the probability density @xmath58 in the region @xmath52 is @xmath59    the decrease of @xmath60 should be determined by the probability distribution taken in the boundary point @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",

    "evidently , the decrease of @xmath60 is described by the exponential law @xmath65    having returned to the initial variables @xmath23 and @xmath66 we obtain the following expression for the probability density @xmath32 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 being considered as a normalizing factor , i.e. , @xmath71    to confirm the assumptions made above and the obtained equations , we have compared the evolution of the probability density @xmath32 given by  ( [ eq : probabdistribminus ] ) with the result of the direct numerical calculation of the fokker - plank equation  ( [ eq : fpeminus ] ) with the values of control parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 .     obtained by means of the direct numerical integration of fokker - plank equation  ( [ eq : fpeminus ] ) , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",

    "since the transient is very short in comparison with the exponential decrease of the probability density @xmath32 we can neglect them and use only the second time interval @xmath90 to obtain the statistical characteristics of the type - i intermittent behavior in the presence of noise .",

    "though the characterization of the intermittent process has been explicitly derived here for model systems , we expect that the very same mechanism can be observed in many other relevant circumstances where the level of natural noise is sufficient , e.g. in the physiological  @xcite or physical systems  @xcite .",
