    "in this work , we investigate an epidemic spreading on a random graph with fixed degree distribution and evolving according to an sir model as follows . every individual not yet infected is assumed to be susceptible .",
    "infected individuals stay infected during random exponential times with mean @xmath0 during which they infect each of their susceptible neighbors with rate @xmath1 . at the end of the infectious period ,",
    "the individual becomes removed and is no longer susceptible to the disease .",
    "contrary to the classical mixing compartmental sir epidemic models ( e.g. , @xcite and see @xcite , chapter 2 , for a presentation ) , heterogeneity in the number of contacts makes it difficult to describe the dynamical behavior of the epidemic .",
    "mean field approximations ( e.g. , @xcite ) or large population approximations ( e.g. , @xcite , see also equation ( 3 ) of @xcite in discrete time ) provide a set of denumerable equations to describe our system .",

    "the convergence of the continuous - time stochastic sir model to its deterministic limit for large graphs was , however , not proved . in this paper",
    ", we prove the convergence that was left open by volz . to achieve this",
    ", we provide a  rigorous individual - based description of the epidemic on a random graph .",
    "three degree distributions are sufficient to describe the epidemic dynamics .",
    "we describe these distributions by equations in the space of measures on the set of nonnegative integers , of which volz s equations are a by - product . starting with a node - centered description , we show that the individual dimension is lost in the large graph limit .",
    "our construction heavily relies on the choice of a cm for the graph underlying the epidemic , which was also made in @xcite .",

    "if we consider an edge as emanating from the vertex @xmath3 and directed to the vertex @xmath4 , we call @xmath3 the _ ego _ of the edge and @xmath4 the _ alter_. the number of neighbors of a given individual is the _ degree _ of the associated vertex .",

    "the measure @xmath56 provides information on the number of edges from @xmath11 to @xmath10 , through which the disease can propagate .",

    "the degree distributions mentioned above can then be approximated , after proper scaling , by the solution @xmath61 of the system of deterministic measure - valued equations ( [ limitereseauinfinis])([limitereseauinfinisr ] ) with initial conditions @xmath62 , @xmath63 and  @xmath64 .    for all @xmath65 ,",

    "remark that the graph in the limit is infinite .",
    "the probability that an individual of degree @xmath7 has been infected by none of her @xmath7 edges is @xmath84 and equation ( [ limitereseauinfinis ] ) follows . in ( [ limitereseauinfinisi ] ) , the first integral corresponds to infectious individuals being removed . in the second integral , @xmath85 is the rate of infection of a given susceptible individual of degree  @xmath7 .",
    "once she gets infected , the multinomial term determines the number of edges connected to susceptible , infectious and removed neighbors .",
    "multi - edges do not occur .",
    "each infectious neighbor has a degree chosen in the size - biased distribution @xmath86 and the number of edges to @xmath10 is reduced by 1 .",
    "this explains the third integral .",
    "similar arguments hold for ( [ limitereseauinfinisr ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath87 , we obtain the following countable system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath88 it is noteworthy to say that this system is similar but not identical to that in ball and neal @xcite .",
    "our equations differ since our mechanism is not the same ( compare section [ sectiondynamics ] with section 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the number of links of an individual to @xmath16 decreases as the epidemic progresses , which modifies her infectivity .    the system ( [ limitereseauinfinis])([limitereseauinfinisr ] )",
    "allows us to recover the equations proposed by volz @xcite , table 3 , page 297 .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics of the epidemic is obtained by solving the following closed system of four odes , referred to as volz s equations in the sequel .",
    "the latter are obtained directly from ( [ limitereseauinfinis])([limitereseauinfinisr ] ) and the definitions of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 which relate these quantities to the measures @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath91 be the generating function for the initial degree distribution of the susceptible individuals @xmath92 , and let @xmath93 .",
    "then , the epidemic can be approximated by the solution of the four following odes : @xmath94 here , the graph structure appears through the generating function @xmath95 . in  ( [ volz2 ] )",
    ", we see that the classical contamination terms @xmath96 ( mass action ) or @xmath97 ( frequency dependence ) of mixing sir models ( e.g. , @xcite ) are replaced by @xmath98 .",
    "the fact that new infectious individuals are chosen in the size - biased distribution is hidden in the term @xmath99 .",
    "the beginning of the epidemic and computation of the reproduction number , when the numbers of infected individuals and of contaminating edges are small and when volz s deterministic approximation does not hold , makes the object of another study .",
    "in this section , we introduce configuration model graphs and describe the propagation of sir on such graphs .      graphs at large can be mathematically represented as matrices with integer entries : to each graph corresponds an adjacency matrix , the @xmath100th coefficient of which is the number of edges between the vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 . defining the distribution of a random graph thus amounts to choosing a sigma - field and a probability measure on the space  @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "another approach is to construct a random graph by modifying progressively a given graph , as in erds  renyi model .",
    "several other constructions are possible such as the preferential attachment model , the threshold graphs , etc . here , we are interested in the configuration model ( cm ) proposed by bollobs  @xcite , molloy and reed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and which models graphs with specified degree distribution and independence between the degrees of neighbors . as shown by statistical tests , these models might be realistic in describing community networks .",

    "remark that this linkage procedure does not exclude self - loops or multiple edges . in the following ,",
    "we are interested in a large number of nodes with a fixed degree distribution , hence self - loops and multiple edges become less and less apparent in the global picture ( see , e.g. , @xcite , theorem 3.1.2 ) .",
    "notice that the condition for the existence with positive probability of a  giant component is that the expectation of the size biased distribution is larger than 1 : @xmath106 this is connected with the fact that the galton  watson tree with this offspring distribution is supercritical ( see @xcite , section 3.2 , page 75 , for details ) .",
