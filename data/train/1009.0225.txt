    "if a black hole is a thing , does it have a boundary ?",
    "if so , where is it ?",
    "for stationary black holes the event horizon seems to be the obvious answer @xcite , but for evolving black holes the situation is less clear .",
    "obviously , all black holes must be formed ( a dynamical process ) and then undergo accretion and other evolutionary processes .",
    "furthermore , as a matter of principle isolated black holes always evolve through hawking radiation , and it has been argued that  strictly speaking  the event horizon may not even exist , due to quantum gravity effects close to the singularity @xcite . in any case it has been argued that the event horizon is ` unreasonably global ' @xcite .",
    "thus there are exact solutions  such as the imploding vaidya spacetime @xcite  where an observer can cross the event horizon even though her entire causal past is a piece of flat minkowski space @xcite . in numerical relativity",
    "this problem is posed sharply because one wants to identify the boundary of a black hole in an initial data set , not by inspection of the full solution .",
    "it is then natural to turn to closed trapped surfaces , the hallmark of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "efficient algorithms to identify the region where they occur within a given initial data set do exist @xcite .",
    "the boundary of such a spatial region is called the apparent horizon @xcite , and it is in itself a marginally outer trapped surface @xcite .",
    "it ` evolves ' to form hypersurfaces foliated by such surfaces @xcite , which we refer to as apparent 3-horizons .",
    "in general hypersurfaces foliated by marginally trapped surfaces are called marginally trapped tubes @xcite .",
    "there are still problems , because the location of the horizons obtained in this way depends strongly on an arbitrary slicing into space and time . in general",
    "there will be many marginally trapped tubes in a given black hole spacetime , and they weave through each other in a complicated way @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to locate the boundary of the region through which closed trapped surfaces pass , or the boundary of the region through which outer trapped surfaces pass . for",
    "closed trapped surfaces both null expansions are negative , while for outer trapped surfaces no condition is imposed on the inner expansion .",
    "it is important to make this distinction , because the two regions do not coincide in general .",
    "it was conjectured by eardley @xcite that the region defined by outer trapping coincides with the event horizon .",
    "ben - dov @xcite proved this for the vaidya spacetime , but he also proved that the region containing trapped surfaces with both expansions negative lies strictly inside it .",
    "nevertheless it can still happen that an observer can cross a closed trapped surface even though her entire causal past is a piece of flat minkowski spacetime , as we showed in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "this proves that closed trapped surfaces have highly non - local properties too , they are _ clairvoyant _ : they are  aware \" of things that happen elsewhere , very far away with no causal connection .",
    "we focus on trapped surfaces with both expansions negative , partly because marginally trapped surfaces form marginally trapped tubes  such as future outer trapping horizons @xcite and dynamical horizons @xcite  having particularly interesting properties with regard to energy fluxes and the like , and partly simply for definiteness .",
    "we concentrate on spherically symmetric imploding spacetimes .",
    "we originally thought that this restriction would enable us to fully characterise the boundary @xmath1 of the trapped region  the region through which closed trapped surfaces pass  but in fact we did not succeed in this .",
    "still we are able to give what we think is a quite coherent picture of the trapped regions that occur in spherically symmetric spacetimes , and in particular we identify a past barrier for the location of closed trapped surfaces , and of marginally trapped tubes .",
    "this boundary turns out to have some quite non - local properties , and may penetrate flat regions of the spacetime .",
    "we will further prove that in spherically symmetric spacetimes the boundary @xmath1 can never in itself contain any marginally trapped surfaces , so that it can not be a marginally trapped tube .",
    "once we have learnt that the boundary @xmath1 of the trapped region suffers from non - local properties which are related to those of the event horizon , and that it is not a marginally trapped tube , we put forward a novel idea that may allow us to determine a preferred marginally trapped tube .",
    "we define the core @xmath2 of the trapped region as the region which is indispensable to maintain closed trapped surfaces .",
    "this core turns out to be generically smaller than the trapped region , and its boundary may thus be used as a definition of the black hole .",
    "we will actually identify a particular core in spherically symmetric spacetimes , and we will prove that its boundary is the unique spherically symmetric marginally trapped tube .",
    "it remains as an interesting question to know if this is the unique marginally trapped tube which is the boundary of a core .    in outline ,",
    "our paper is organised as follows : section [ sec : preli ] contains reminders about trapped surfaces , the fauna of different cases that can occur , and how they can be characterised in a way convenient for our purposes by the mean curvature vector .",
    "section [ sec : tandb ] defines the trapped region and its boundary @xmath1 , and gives their basic properties . throughout the paper we provide proofs of all statements that we make .",
    "section [ sec : fun ] gives some basic results on which we build the rest of the paper .",
    "the arguments are purely geometrical and based on the interplay between ( causal ) vector fields and surfaces with special properties of their mean curvature vectors .",
    "many of these results are already known @xcite but we do offer some sharpenings , such as theorem [ th : no - min ] and corollary [ cor : noposk ] .",
    "section [ sec : rw ] is an interlude dealing with robertson - walker spacetimes . in this case",
    "the general results of section 4 are sufficient to pin down the boundary @xmath1 exactly . section [ sec : general ] introduces spherically symmetric spacetimes and their unique spherically symmetric apparent 3-horizon . in section [ sec : notah ] we discuss perturbations of the resulting round marginally trapped tubes .",
    "we use the stability operator that describes how the outer expansion varies when a marginally outer trapped surface is deformed @xcite , and give a proof that one can always find trapped surfaces that extend to both sides of the spherically symmetric apparent 3-horizon .",
    "we also show that the region of the perturbed trapped sphere that is inside the apparent 3-horizon can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "section [ sec : imploding ] discusses imploding and asymptotically flat spherically symmetric spacetimes in general . in section [ sec : kodama ] we identify and discuss a past barrier through which future trapped surfaces can not pass .",
    "it is based on the presence of the hypersurface forming kodama vector field @xcite , and our restriction is a definite improvement on previous results @xcite .",
    "we also prove that any trapped surface must lie at least partly inside the spherically symmetric apparent 3-horizon . in section",
    "[ sec : converse ] we discuss the precise location and the properties of the boundary @xmath1 in a generic spherically symmetric and imploding spacetime .",
    "we demonstrate that the boundary @xmath1 of the trapped region can not be a marginally trapped tube .",
    "section [ sec : new ] raises a new issue : given that trapped surfaces must be confined at least partly within the spherically symmetric apparent horizon , what is the minimal region that must be removed from spacetime in order for it to have no closed trapped surfaces at all ?",
    "we call this the core of the trapped region .",
    "we show that the spherically symmetric apparent 3-horizon is the boundary of one such core .",
    "finally , the important example provided by the vaidya spacetime is treated in an appendix .",
    "trapped surfaces are the basic objects to be studied in this paper .",
    "thus , we start by providing their definition and their types , and by fixing our notation .",
    "standard references are @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a 4-dimensional causally orientable spacetime with metric @xmath4 of signature @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a connected 2-dimensional surface with local intrinsic coordinates @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) imbedded in @xmath9 by the @xmath10 parametric equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 are local coordinates for @xmath9 .",
    "the tangent vectors @xmath13 of @xmath6 are locally given by _",

    ", we shall assume that @xmath16 is positive definite so that @xmath6 is a _",

    "then , the two linearly independent normal one - forms @xmath17 to @xmath6 can be chosen to be null and future directed everywhere on @xmath6 , so they satisfy @xmath18 where the last equality incorporates a condition of normalization .",
    "obviously , there still remains the freedom @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a positive function defined only on @xmath6 .",
    "the standard splitting into tangential and normal directions to @xmath6 leads to a formula relating the covariant derivatives on @xmath3 and on @xmath21 @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the coefficients of the levi - civita connection @xmath24 of @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 is the shape tensor ( also called second fundamental form vector , and extrinsic curvature vector ) of @xmath6 in @xmath3 . note that @xmath28 is symmetric , and orthogonal to @xmath6 , from where we deduce @xmath29 here , @xmath30 are two symmetric covariant tensor fields defined on @xmath6 and called the two null ( future ) second fundamental forms of @xmath6 in @xmath3 .",

    "clearly , @xmath37 is invariant under transformations ( [ free ] ) .",
    "the class of _ weakly future - trapped _",
    "( f - trapped from now on ) surfaces are characterized by having @xmath37 pointing to the future everywhere on @xmath6 , and similarly for weakly past trapped .",
    "there are three important subcases that deserve their own name : ( i )",
    "the traditional f - trapped surfaces have @xmath40 timelike everywhere on @xmath6 ; ( ii ) marginally f - trapped surfaces have @xmath41 null everywhere on @xmath6 ; and ( iii ) minimal surfaces have @xmath42 on @xmath6 .",
    "these conditions can be equivalently expressed in terms of the signs of the expansions as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this is to be compared with @xcite , as sometimes different names are given to the same objects , and vice versa . in particular , weakly f - trapped surfaces were called nearly f - trapped in @xcite . here we will follow the previous nomenclature which pretends to respect standard names as much as possible",
    ". see @xcite for further details . in the case",
    "that @xmath37 is proportional to one of the null normals but realizing both causal orientations the surface is said to be null dual , or marginally @xmath43-trapped , where the @xmath44 refers to the direction with vanishing expansion as the definition is equivalent to having either @xmath45 or @xmath46 vanishing . in the literature",
    "they are usually referred as mots (  marginally outer trapped surfaces \" ) , by declaring the direction with vanishing expansion to be  outer \" .    for completeness and future reference",
    ", we also mention that a surface is called _ untrapped _ if the mean curvature vector is spacelike everywhere , or equivalently , if both expansions have opposite signs .",
    "in this paper , we will be concerned with the following sets in @xmath3 , see also @xcite .",
    "the future - trapped region @xmath0 is defined as the set of points @xmath47 such that @xmath48 lies on a closed future - trapped surface .",
    "since the characterization of f - trapped surfaces is the negativity of both null expansions @xmath49 as defined in ( [ tr ] ) , the following general property follows easily .",
    "[ pr : topen ] the future - trapped region @xmath0 is an open set .    take any @xmath50 and let @xmath51 be a closed f - trapped surface .",
    "we can perturb any such @xmath6 along an arbitrary direction @xmath52 defined on @xmath6 , by moving any point @xmath53 along @xmath52 a distance @xmath54 .",
    "the deformed surface @xmath55 has future null expansions @xmath56 , where @xmath49 are the null expansions on @xmath6 and the variations @xmath57 are given by precise formulas involving @xmath52 , the future null normals to @xmath6 and the geometric properties of @xmath6 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as @xmath58 and @xmath57 are continuous on @xmath6 , we can always choose @xmath59 small enough such that @xmath60 for _ any _ given direction @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that there exists a small neighborhood @xmath61 of @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .    in general",
    ", @xmath0 does not have to be connected .",
    "any connected component of @xmath0 will thus be termed as a `` connected f - trapped region '' .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 can be empty , or it can be the whole spacetime .",
    "an example of the former case @xmath64 is provided by any globally static spacetime @xcite .",
    "examples of the latter case @xmath65 are de sitter spacetime or some contracting robertson - walker geometries , see section [ sec : rw ] . however , in asymptotically flat black - hole type spacetimes @xcite neither of these cases will happen , because there are no trapped surfaces near spatial infinity , and there will appear future - trapped surfaces in the black hole region . in these cases",
    "@xmath0 will have a boundary on @xmath3 .",
    "[ def : b ] we denote by @xmath1 the boundary of the future - trapped region @xmath0 : @xmath66    [ pr : bclosed ] @xmath1 being the boundary of an open set , it is itself a _ closed _ set without boundary .",
    "moreover @xmath67 .",
    "[ pr:2sides ] @xmath1 is also the boundary of the untrapped region defined by the set of points @xmath68 , that is , such that @xmath48 does not lie on any closed f - trapped surface .",
    "we remark that @xmath1 is not necessarily connected .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are genuine spacetime objects , independent of any foliations or initial cauchy data sets .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are different in nature from the trapped regions and their boundaries contained in given slices , as recently studied in @xcite .    the symmetries of the spacetimes respect @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely :    [ res : bandsym ] if @xmath69 is the group of isometries of the spacetime @xmath3 , then @xmath0 is invariant under the action of @xmath69 , and the transitivity surfaces of @xmath69 , relative to points of @xmath1 , remain in @xmath1 .",
    "take any point @xmath50 .",
    "then there is a closed f - trapped surface @xmath6 passing through @xmath48 . by moving @xmath6 via the motion group @xmath69 , and",
    "as f - trapped surfaces are moved to f - trapped surfaces by isometries , it follows that the whole transitivity surface of the group passing through @xmath48 lies in @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath70 , so that any small neighborhood of @xmath71 intersects @xmath0 . by moving one such small neighborhood using @xmath69",
    "one similarly deduces that the transitivity surface of @xmath69 relative to @xmath71 is part of @xmath1 .",
    "an implication of this result is that no globally defined killing vector can be transversal to @xmath72 .",
    "actually , this also holds for homothetic killing vectors ( vector fields @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 ) as they also respect f - trapped surfaces ( if @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "[ cor : sym ] let @xmath76 be the ( global ) continuous group of isometries of @xmath3 where @xmath77 is its dimension ( i.e. , the number of linearly independent killing vectors ) and let @xmath78 be the dimension of its surfaces of transitivity .    1 .   if @xmath79 and @xmath80 , that is , if the spacetime is homogeneous , then @xmath81 and either @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",

    "in particular , in arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes , @xmath1 ( if not empty ) is a spherically symmetric hypersurface without boundary .",
    "point 1 is immediate .",
    "points 2 and 3 follow because any connected component of @xmath1 can not have a boundary and can not be given by isolated 2-dimensional surfaces of transitivity , as these would contradict its basic properties [ pr : bclosed ] and [ pr:2sides ] .",
    "what is the possible relevance of @xmath1 ?",
    "apart from answering natural questions such as `` where can there be closed f - trapped surfaces ? '' or `` is this event part of a closed f - trapped surface ? '' , the location of @xmath1 provides important physical information due to the fundamental relevance of closed trapped surfaces in the development of black holes and singularities @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it provides a precise limit as to where dynamical horizons or marginally trapped tubes can develop .",
    "one could also hope that @xmath1 is related to the surface of a dynamical black hole .",
    "we are going to see that this suffers from the same problems as other candidates .",
    "in this section we present the main results that will allow us to put restrictions on the location of the region @xmath0 containing the closed future - trapped surfaces of a spacetime and its boundary @xmath1 .",
    "these results are fully general , and can be obtained within the framework of the interplay between generalized symmetries and submanifolds with special properties of their mean curvature vector .",
    "the underlying ideas come from @xcite .",
    "we start with the main formula to be used in what follows .",
    "let @xmath73 be an arbitrary @xmath86 vector field on @xmath9 defined on a neighbourhood of @xmath6 .",
    "recalling the identity @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the lie derivative with respect to @xmath73 , one gets on using ( [ nablas2 ] ) @xmath89 contracting now with @xmath35 we arrive at [ main ] where @xmath90 is the orthogonal projector that projects any object to its part tangent to @xmath6 .",
    "the elementary formula ( [ main ] ) is very useful and permits one to obtain many interesting results about the existence of weakly trapped closed surfaces in the presence of generalized symmetries , see @xcite .",
    "for instance :    1 .",
    "if @xmath6 is minimal ( @xmath91 ) , integrating ( [ main ] ) and using gauss theorem one finds that the divergence term does not contribute _ whenever _",
    "@xmath6 is closed ( that is , compact without boundary ) , ergo @xmath92 observe that this relation must be satisfied for _ all _ possible vector fields @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , closed minimal surfaces are very rare .",
    "2 .   if @xmath73 is a killing vector , then the left hand side of ( [ main ] ) vanishes . integrating the righthand side on @xmath6 we get for closed @xmath6 @xmath93 therefore ,",
    "if the killing vector @xmath73 is timelike on @xmath6 , then @xmath6 can not be weakly trapped ( neither future nor past ) , unless it is minimal .",
    "the following is an important consequence of formula ( [ main ] ) .",

[ prop : nonsphsymcore ] there exist non - spherically symmetric cores of the f - trapped region in spherically symmetric spacetimes .    consider the case when the spacetime has only one connected component of ah , which is spacelike , such as for example the vaidya spacetime in the appendix . from corollary [ cor : lars ] or",

    "take any of these , say @xmath619 , so that @xmath619 lies partly to the future of ah ( and partly to its past ) . from theorem 4.1 in @xcite , no weakly f - trapped surface can be fully contained in the past domain of dependence of @xmath619 .",
