    "in addition , a major drawback of incorporating state - of - the - art pulsed dynamical decoupling in sensing schemes is that usually , the frequency of the pulses must coincide with the frequency of the sensed field ; the time interval between the pulses should be fixed to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the frequency of the signal .",

    "this ensures that the rate of transitions from @xmath28 to @xmath29 due to magnetic noise is negligible .",
