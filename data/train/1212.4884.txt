    "the past decades have seen a great number of discoveries of planets around stars other than our sun @xcite .",
    "as some of these planets are of terrestrial nature , hopes to identifying earth analogues have lead to considerable advances towards the detection of possibly habitable worlds @xcite .",
    "even though quite frequent in the solar neighborhood @xcite , not many attempts have yet been made to specifically target binary stars in this endeavor .",
    "nonetheless , more than 60 planets have already been found in and around such systems @xcite .",
    "although several p - type ( circumbinary ) planets orbiting both stars of a close binary have also been found @xcite , most planets are in the so - called s - type @xcite configuration where the planet orbits only one of the binary s stars .",
    "a prominent example of an s - type system is @xmath0 centauri ab which hosts a terrestrial planet around the fainter binary component , @xmath0 cen b @xcite .",
    "the reason for the general reluctance to include binary systems in the search for terrestrial , habitable planets lies in the assumption that the additional interactions with a massive companion will make planets harder to find .",
    "that is primarily because the gravitational interaction between the second star and a planet may alter the planet s orbit significantly and complicate the task of interpreting the planetary signal .",
    "one aim of this work is , therefore , to show that changes in the planet s orbit can actually enhance its detectability ( see section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "of course , the orbit of a binary as well as its stellar parameters have to be well determined in order to be able to identify signals from additional terrestrial planets . sensing the need for a better understanding of binary star systems , efforts have been intensified to improve physical as well as orbital data for nearby binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and to evolve existing data analysis methodologies @xcite .",
    "understanding the complex interactions between a stellar binary and a planet is essential if a system s potential habitability is to be evaluated .",
    "for instance , one of the main assumptions of classical habitability , as introduced by @xcite , is that the planet moves around its host star on a circular orbit .",
    "this may not be a valid assumption for planets in a binary star system where the gravitational perturbation of the secondary can excite the eccentricity of the planet s orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that except for s - type systems where the secondary star is much more luminous than the planet s host star , variations in planetary orbit around the planet - hosting star are the main cause for changes in insolation .",
    "even though @xcite gave an analytic recipe for calculating the boundaries of the hzs in s - type binaries , it remains to be seen whether an earth - like planet in the hz of a system with two sun - like stars will in fact be detectable .    in order to answer this question ,",
    "we consider three techniques , namely , radial velocity ( rv ) , astrometry ( am ) and transit photometry ( tp ) , and discuss whether the current observational facilities are capable of detecting habitable planets in such systems .",
    "we provide analytical formula for estimating the strength of rv and am signals for habitable , earth - like planets , and show that the planet - binary interaction can enhance the chances for the detection of these objects .",
    "the rest of this article will be structured as follows . in sections [ sec : rv ] and [ sec :",
    "astrometry ] analytic estimates of the maximum and root mean square ( rms ) of the strength of an rv and an am signal that an earth - like planet produces in an s - type binary configuration will be derived .",
    "section [ sec : tp ] will deal with consequences of such a setup for tp .",
    "we will then briefly recall the different types of hzs for s - type binaries established in @xcite , and use their methodology to identify similar habitable regions in the @xmath0 centauri system ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "this system has been chosen because first , it has inspired many studies on the possibility of the formation and detection of habitable planets around its stellar components @xcite and second , @xcite have already discovered an earth - sized planet in a short - period orbit around its secondary star .",
    "therefore , we will compare our rv estimates to the actual signal of @xmath0 cen bb , and study its influence on an additional terrestrial planet presumed in @xmath0 cen b s hz .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : dis ] , the projected rv , am and tp traces that terrestrial planets will leave in the hz of the @xmath0 centauri system are analyzed , and the results are discussed within the context of the sensitivity of the current observational facilities .",
    "to estimate the rv signal that an earth - like planet produces in an s - type binary system , we will build upon the formalism presented by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the non - planetary contributions to the host star s rv signal ( such as the rv variation caused by the motion of the binary around its center of gravity ) are known and have been subtracted , leaving behind only the residual signal due to the planet .",
    "the motion of the planet around its host star then constitutes a perturbed two body problem , where the gravitational influence of the secondary star is still playing a role and is mirrored in the forced variations of the planet s orbit .    in practice , the extraction of the planetary signal is all but a trivial task . even after subtraction of the binary s barycentric and proper motion ,",
    "the residual will contain contributions from the binary s orbital uncertainties as well as from non - gravitational sources which could be orders of magnitude larger than the star s reflex signal , such as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in transiting systems , for example @xcite .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0 cen bb showed , however , that a substantial reduction of non - planetary rv interference is possible if the respective binary star has been studied in sufficient detail .",
    "the amplitude of the planet induced rv signal of the host star , @xmath1 , is given by    @xmath2\\ , ,   \\label{eq : vr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is equal to    @xmath4    in equation ( [ eq : vrk ] ) , @xmath5 is the planet to star mass - ratio with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the masses of the planet and host - star , respectively .",
    "the planet s mean motion , @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 with , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the planet s orbital period and gravitational constant .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denote the planet s semimajor axis , eccentricity , orbital inclination relative to the plane of the sky , true - anomaly , and argument of periastron , respectively .",
    "our goal in this section is to identify the range of the possible peak amplitudes that a terrestrial planet in an s - type binary configuration can produce .",
    "we note that the gravitational influence of the second star causes the planet s orbital elements to vary , thus inducing additional time dependent changes in the radial velocity signal @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "while we know from secular perturbation theory that @xmath14 does not change significantly with time for hierarchical systems such as the one under consideration @xcite , @xmath13 becomes a function of time .",
    "we assume coplanar orbits of the planet and the binary star which results in the planet s inclination to the plane of the sky ( @xmath15 ) to remain constant .",
    "in contrast , the planetary eccentricity will vary between zero and a maximum @xmath16 , where the latter value can be expressed as a function of the system s masses and the binary s orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "this is important , because the reflex rv signal ( @xmath1 ) of a star can be increased significantly by planetary orbital eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : vr ] ) we identify the global maximum of @xmath1 at @xmath17 , when @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    equation ( [ eq : vrmax ] ) presents a fully analytic estimate of the expected maximum rv signal that a terrestrial planet produces in an s - type binary configuration .    as an example for the influence of a double star on a planetary rv signal ,",
    "the induced variations in the rv of the planet s host - star are presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the host - star is a constituent of a solar - type binary with a semimajor axis of 20 au and an orbital eccentricity of 0.5 .",
    "changes in the amplitude of @xmath1 are due to variations in the planet s eccentricity .",
    "since we do not know the state of the planet s orbital eccentricity at the time of observation , we consider a range for the maximum possible amplitudes of its radial velocity ,    @xmath21    although the range of the amplitude of the host star s rv signal , as given by equation ( [ eq : range ] ) , can be used to identify the `` best case '' detectability limits , the maximum values of the rv signal due to the planet will be `` snapshots '' that are reached only during brief moments . as a result , their values for assessing the precision needed to trace fingerprints of an earth - like planet are rather limited . in such cases ,",
    "expressions for the rms of the astrometric signal are preferable .",
    "since rms values are by convention time - averaged , we substitute @xmath22 by the mean anomaly @xmath23 in all corresponding functions using the equation of the center expansion up to the sixth order in planetary eccentricities ( see appendix [ sec : eoc ] ) and average over @xmath24 and @xmath13 .",
    "the vastly different rates of change of these quantities ( ) make it possible to consider @xmath13 to remain constant during one cycle of @xmath24 , so that independent averaging can be performed . in order to eliminate short term variations in the rv signal ,",
    "we first average over @xmath24 . averaging over @xmath13 as well",
    "might be desirable if for example the initial state of @xmath13 is unknown , or if observations stretch beyond secular evolution timescales of the planets argument of pericenter .",
    "we , therefore , define two different types of rms evaluations for a square - integrable function @xmath25 ;    @xmath26^{1/2 } ,    \\label{eq : rms}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath27^{1/2}. \\label{eq : rms2}\\ ] ]    using equations ( [ eq : rms ] ) and ( [ eq : rms2 ] ) , the rms values of @xmath1 are then given by    @xmath28 \\cos(2 \\omega)\\right\\}^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq : vrrms } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath29    here we have considered @xmath30 since @xcite . also ,    @xmath31    as indicated in appendix [ sec : ave2 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the averaging over @xmath13 causes the rms value of the rv signal to become independent of @xmath32 so that its difference with the peak signal in the circular case ( @xmath33 ) becomes a mere factor of @xmath34 .",
    "thanks to their intricate relation to power - spectra , rms values can also be valuable for orbit - fitting .",
    "the choice of singly or doubly averaged rms relations for this purpose will depend on how many planetary orbital periods are available in the data set . in the case of @xmath0 cen bb , there are order - of - magnitude differences in the rates of change of the mean anomaly ( @xmath35 ) and the argument of pericenter ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it would , therefore , make more sense to assume @xmath13 to be constant and add it as a variable in the fitting process .",
    "if stronger perturbations or additional forces act on the planet , the periods can be considerably shorter , so that the fully averaged equations might come in handy .",
    "in order to derive the maximum and rms values for an astrometric signal , we will use the framework presented in @xcite .",
    "we again assume that the non - planetary contributions have been subtracted from the combined signal of the host star and planet . the projected motion of the planet on the astrometric plane is then given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the projected orbit , @xmath32 is the planet s orbital eccentricity , @xmath40 is the eccentric anomaly , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the modified thiele - innes constants given by    @xmath43    in these equations , @xmath44 is the distance between the observer and the observed system in units of the planetary semimajor axis @xmath14 .",
    "we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : xye ] ) in terms of the true anomaly @xmath22 as ,    @xmath45    in these equations , represents the planet s radial distance to its host star . because the motion of the planet itself can not be traced , we translate these equations into the apparent motion of the host star by the application of newton s third law",
    ". that is ,    @xmath46    here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the projected coordinates of the center of mass of the planet - star system , and @xmath49 denotes the planet - star mass - ratio as defined for equation ( 2 ) .",
    "assuming without the loss of generality that the barycenter of the star - planet system coincides with the origin of the associated coordinate system , the distance of the projected stellar orbit to the coordinate center will be equal to    @xmath50}{(1 + e \\cos{f})^2}.\\label{eq : rho2 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) is independent of @xmath51 and has a global maximum at when @xmath18 .",
    "this translates into a maximum astrometric amplitude given by    @xmath52    where @xmath53    the planetary maximum am signal will again lie between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a remarkable feature of @xmath55 and @xmath54 is their independence of the system s inclination @xmath15 .",
    "this is visualized in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the same figure also shows the time evolution of the am signal due to an earth - like planet orbiting @xmath0 cen b at a distance of 1 au .",
    "the astrometric rms values are given by    @xmath56 - 3)\\right ) \\sin^2{i}\\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : rhorms } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath57^{1/2}.\\label{eq : rhorms2 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    details regarding the derivation of equations ( [ eq : rhorms ] ) and ( [ eq : rhorms2 ] ) can be found in appendix [ sec : ave2 ] .",
    "in contrast to the doubly averaged equations for the rms of an rv signal , equation ( [ eq : rhorms2 ] ) shows a dependence on the binary s eccentricity . in cases where the planetary inclination @xmath15 coincides with the inclination of the binary itself ,",
    "analytic expressions for @xmath58 are available @xcite .",
    "in transit photometry , signal strength is equivalent to the relative depth of the dint the planet produces in the stellar light - curve during its transit . assuming that the star - planet configuration allows for occultations , and excluding grazing transits , the fractional depth of the photometric transit ( @xmath59 ) produced by an earth - like planet is simply given by the proportion of the luminous area of the disk of the star that is covered by the planet as the planet moves between the observer and the star .",
    "ignoring limb darkening , that means , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the radius of the planet and @xmath62 is the stellar radius .",
    "the overall probability to observe a transit is given by @xcite :    @xmath63    in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) , @xmath64 is the radial distance of the planet to the star during the transit . for an eccentric planetary motion , the planet - star distance during transit",
    "can be expressed as @xcite , where @xmath65 denotes the argument of pericenter measured from the line of sight . in analogy to sections [ sec : rv ] and [ sec : astrometry ] , the maximum and averaged transit probability for a planet perturbed by the secondary star in a planar configuration can be calculated by substituting for @xmath64 in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) and averaging over @xmath65 .",
    "this will result in    @xmath66    and    @xmath67    equations ( [ eq : prob3 ] ) and ( [ eq : prob4 ] ) indicate that the increase in the eccentricity of the planet due to the perturbation of the secondary increases the probability of transit .",
    "in deriving these equations , we have ignored the occultation of the planet by the second star . however , depending on the period ratio between the secondary and the planet , such conjunctions are either scarce or short - lived .",
    "consequently , their contribution to the probability of witnessing a planetary transit is negligibly small .",
    "in this section we will show that the previously derived analytic expressions produce results that are in good agreement with the current observations of @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "we will also present numerical evidence that the presence - or absence - of an additional terrestrial - planet in the hz of @xmath0 cen b can not be derived easily from the orbit evolution of @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "consequently , we argue that an independent detection of additional terrestrial companions might be difficult , but more promising . for this purpose , we will determine the hz of @xmath0 cen b , as well as the rv , am and tp signatures of an earth - like planet orbiting in the hz of @xmath0 cen b. since there is no a priori reason why the brighter component of @xmath0 centauri could not be hosting a terrestrial planet as well , we perform a similar analysis for @xmath0 cen a. we will also study the behavior of equations ( [ eq : vr]-[eq : prob4 ] ) for a broad range of binary eccentricities .",
    "the planet discovered around @xmath0 cen b offers a perfect opportunity to compare the rv amplitude predictions derived in section [ sec : rv ] with actual measurements .",
    "the planet s known orbital parameters are given in table  [ tab1 ] . in table  [ tab2 ] we present the analytic estimates of section [ sec : rv ] applied to the system .",
    "assuming the system to be coplanar ( @xmath68 ) , the predicted rv amplitude for circular planetary motion ( @xmath33 ) is very close to the observed rv amplitude .",
    "this is not surprising , since the planetary parameters were derived from an rv signal using the same methodology in reverse . while still well within measurement uncertainties , the deviation of the maximum rv amplitude ( @xmath69 ) from the observed value is larger than that of @xmath33 .",
    "on the one hand , this might indicate that the planet is currently in an orbital evolution phase where its eccentricity is almost zero . on the other hand",
    ", the planet may be too close to its host star for our model to predict @xmath69 correctly .",
    "in fact , we show in section [ sec : cenhz ] that the latter explanation is more likely , since the influence of general relativity ( gr ) can not be neglected in this case .",
    "estimates based on newtonian physics exaggerate the actual eccentricity of @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "its orbit remains practically circular despite the interaction with the binary star ( see section [ sec : cenhz ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this justifies the assumption of a circular planetary orbit made by @xcite .",
    "since we are especially interested in additional habitable planets , however , it is worthwhile to ask whether predictions on the orbital evolution of @xmath0 cen bb can be used to exclude the presence of other gravitationally active bodies in the system . in other words : could an earth - like planet still orbit in the hz of @xmath0 cen b or would the accompanying distortions of the orbit of @xmath0 cen bb be significant enough to detect them immediately ? before we try to answer these questions , we need to briefly recall some important aspects regarding hzs in binary star systems .      combining the classical definition of a hz @xcite with the dynamical properties of a planet - hosting double star system , @xcite have shown that one can distinguish three types of hz in an s - type binary system :    the permanently habitable zone ( * phz * ) : :    where a planet _ always _ stays within the insolation limits    ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) as defined by @xcite and    @xcite . in other words , despite the changes in its orbit , the planet    never leaves the classical hz .",
    "the total insolation the planet    receives will vary between the inner @xmath72 and outer    @xmath73 effective radiation limits as    @xmath74 where , for a given stellar    spectral type , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are in units of    solar constant ( 1360 [ w / m@xmath75 ) .",
    "the extended habitable zone ( * ehz * ) : :    where , in contrast to the phz , parts of the planetary orbit may lie    outside the hz due to the planet s high eccentricity , for instance .    yet , the binary - planet configuration is still considered to be    habitable when most of the planet s orbit remains inside the    boundaries of the hz . in this case ,    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes the    time - averaged effective insolation from both stars and    @xmath79 is the effective insolation variance .",
    "the averaged habitable zone ( * ahz * ) .",
    ": :    following the argument of @xcite that planetary eccentricities up to    @xmath80 may not be prohibitive for habitability as long as    the atmosphere can act as a buffer , the ahz is defined as encompassing    all configurations which support the planet s _ time - averaged _",
    "effective insolation to be within the limits of the classical hz",
    ".    therefore ,    @xmath81 .",
    "analytic expressions for the maximum insolation , the average insolation @xmath82 , and insolation variance that a planet encounters in a binary system have been derived in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that article for more details .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the application of the proposed habitability classification scheme to the @xmath0 centauri system . in these figures ,",
    "blue denotes phzs , green shows ehzs , and yellow corresponds to ahzs .",
    "the red areas in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are uninhabitable , and purple stands for dynamically unstable regions .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the physical properties of the system .",
    "we used the formulae by @xcite to calculate @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the given effective temperatures of @xmath0 cen a and b. in general , these formulae allow for extending the analytic estimates for hzs , as given by @xcite , to main sequence stars with different spectral types .",
    "runaway greenhouse and maximum greenhouse insolation limits were used to determine the inner and outer boundaries of hz , respectively .    as shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ]",
    ", the locations of the hzs and the detectability of habitable planets in those regions depend strongly on the eccentricity of the binary ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the actual eccentricity of the @xmath0 centauri system is denoted by a horizontal line at @xmath86 .",
    "the values for the borders of the different hzs using @xmath0 centauri s actual eccentricity are listed in table [ tab3 ] . as shown here , both stars permit dynamical stability for habitable , earth - like planets . due to the difference in stellar luminosities ,",
    "the hzs around @xmath0 cen a are larger and farther away from the host star compared to @xmath0 cen b. since the binary s mass - ratio is close to 0.45 , the gravitational influence of @xmath0 cen b is more pronounced on the phz of @xmath0 cen a. this is a consequence of the larger injected planetary eccentricities ( @xmath87 ) as can be seen from the top row of figure [ fig5 ] . the relatively larger gravitational influence of @xmath0 cen b onto the hz of @xmath0 cen a is also mirrored in the fact that the region of dynamical instability ( purple ) reaches towards lower binary eccentricities .",
    "the change in the range and configuration of hzs with the change in planetary semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary is pronounced . a clear shrinking trend for phz and ehz can be observed for high values of the binary s eccentricity . while as shown by @xcite , the ahz in general expands slightly when the eccentricity is enhanced ,",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show that in the @xmath0 centauri system , this hz depends only weakly on @xmath85 making it the closest approximation to the classical hz as defined by @xcite . comparing these results with the existing studies on the hzs for @xmath0 cen b such as @xcite and @xcite",
    ", one can see that the values of the inner boundaries of the hzs around @xmath0 cen b as given in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , coincide well with the previous studies .",
    "@xcite even found a similar shrinking trend with higher planetary eccentricity .",
    "yet , @xcite did not take the actual coupling between the planet s eccentricity and the binary s orbit into account .",
    "the limits for the outer boundaries of hz in our model are different from the ones in @xcite since different climatic assumptions were made . in this work we used insolation limits for atmospheric collapse assuming a maximum greenhouse atmosphere @xcite whereas @xcite focused on emergence from snowball states .",
    "while the classification of habitable zones presented in the previous section is globally applicable to binary star systems , the analytic estimates to calculate their extent @xcite are only strictly valid for three body systems , e.g. the binary star and a planet .",
    "additional perturbers will influence the shape and size of the hzs .",
    "it is thus necessary to investigate which effect the already discovered planet around @xmath0 cen b would have on an additional terrestrial planet in @xmath0 cen b s hz .",
    "if the mutual perturbations were large , the hz boundaries given in table  [ tab3 ] would have to be adapted , but @xmath0 cen bb s orbital evolution could also contain clues on the presence - or absence - of an additional planet .",
    "should the interaction between the inner planet and an additional terrestrial body in the hz be small , then the hz boundaries would hold",
    ". however , a detection of the habitable planet via its influence on @xmath0 cen bb s orbit would become difficult .    in figure [ fig6 ] ,",
    "results of numerical investigations on the coupled orbital evolution of an additional terrestrial planet and @xmath0 cen bb are presented .",
    "the top row of figure [ fig6 ] shows the eccentricity evolution of @xmath0 cen bb altered by an additional earth - like planet at the inner ( red curve ) and outer ( orange curve ) edge of @xmath0 cen b s ahz .",
    "the corresponding reference curve ( blue ) represents @xmath0 cen bb s eccentricity influenced only by the binary @xmath0 cen ab .",
    "the top left panel of figure 3 shows the results in newtonian three ( 3bp ) and four ( 4bp ) body problems .",
    "the top right panel depicts similar analysis with general relativity ( gr ) included .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is quite pronounced , as gr clearly prevents the secular rise in cen bb s eccentricity predicted in the classical setup @xcite .",
    "thus , the orbit of @xmath0 cen bb stays circular , even when tidal forces are neglected .",
    "the variations in semimajor axis ( @xmath88 ) for @xmath0 cen bb are not shown , because they remain below @xmath89 au for all cases .",
    "a possible method to search for additional companions is to measure variations in @xmath0 cen bb s orbital period .",
    "yet , the small @xmath88 values make this approach difficult , since @xmath90 .",
    "disentangling the effects of gr and perturbations due to other habitable planets on @xmath0 cen bb s period would require precisions several orders of magnitude greater than currently available .",
    "the top right panel in figure [ fig6 ] shows that the perturbations an additional planet at the inner edge of @xmath0 cen b s ahz causes in @xmath0 cen bb s eccentricity ( red ) are , in principle , distinguishable from the nominal signal ( blue ) . unfortunately , it is also clear from this graph that neither the required precision nor the observational timescales necessary to identify the presence of an additional earth - sized companion via observations of @xmath0 cen bb s eccentricity seem obtainable in the near future . for habitable planets at the outer edge of @xmath0",
    "cen b s ahz the chances for indirect detection seem even worse , as their influence on @xmath0 cen bb s orbit is negligible ( orange vs. blue curves ) .    in order to confirm that the interaction between @xmath0 cen bb and earth - like planets in the hz is small , as well as to further study the influence of the gr on the dynamics of the system , we examined the orbital evolution of a fictitious habitable planet in that region .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom row of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the left panel depicts the eccentricity evolution of additional terrestrial planets positioned at the inner ( red ) and outer ( green ) edges of @xmath0 cen b s ahz .",
    "the secular variations in the eccentricity ( bottom left panel ) and semimajor axis ( bottom right panel ) of the habitable planet were computed numerically , taking the influence of the binary @xmath0 cen ab , the planet @xmath0 cen bb , as well as gr into account . when comparing the analytic estimates of @xmath16 with the evolution of the habitable planet s eccentricity in the full system , it is evident that neither gr nor @xmath0 cen bb alter the results for planets in @xmath0 cen b s hz significantly .",
    "also , the deviation in the habitable planet s semimajor axis due to gr and @xmath0 cen bb ( @xmath91 ) remains below 0.1% and 0.5% for planets at the inner and outer edge of @xmath0 cen b s ahz , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the interaction between additional terrestrial planets in @xmath0 cen b s hz and @xmath0 cen bb is indeed small .",
    "thus , our estimates for the hzs of the @xmath0 centauri system remain valid .",
    "the existence of additional terrestrial planets on the other hand can not be determined easily from observing the orbital evolution of @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "the presented results are , strictly speaking , only valid for a coplanar configuration , i.e. the binary and both planets are in the same orbital plane .",
    "mutually inclined configurations can exhibit much more involved dynamics such as kozai resonant behavior ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed study of such effects lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , the arguments presented in this section suggest that the search for an additional coplanar planet in the hz around @xmath0 cen b will most likely have to be performed without relying on observations of @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "we will , therefore , investigate whether habitable planets can actually be detected independently in sun - like binary star configurations using current observational facilities .",
    "we apply our methodology , as derived in sections [ sec : rv ] and [ sec : astrometry ] , to a fictitious terrestrial planet in the hz of binary systems similar to @xmath0 centauri ab but with a broadened range of binary eccentricities .",
    "in addition to the habitability maps discussed in section [ sec : hz ] , figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the results regarding peak and rms strength of the rv and astrometric signals . here , the aim is to illustrate how the different types of hzs presented in section [ sec : hz ] , as well as the maximum and rms signal strengths defined in section [ sec : rv ] vary with the binary s eccentricity ( @xmath85 ) and planetary semimajor axis ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig3 ] shows maximum ( _ top _ ) and rms ( _ bottom _ ) values of the signal strengths for the more massive binary component , in this case similar to @xmath0 cen a. results for the less massive component akin to @xmath0 cen b are shown in the right column .",
    "the dashed vertical lines in the top rows of figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] represent the sections of the parameter space with similar @xmath33 and @xmath54 values , respectively . since @xmath33 and @xmath54 are independent of the planetary ( and consequently the binary s ) eccentricity , the different values of these quantities vary linearly with the planet s semimajor axis . in contrast ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath55 , represented by the solid contour lines , depend on the maximum eccentricity of the planet ( @xmath93 ) and therefore change with the binary s eccentricity ( @xmath85 ) . since for circular binary configurations only small eccentricities",
    "are induced into the planet s orbit , @xmath69 and @xmath33 almost coincide .",
    "the same holds true for @xmath55 and @xmath54 in this case .",
    "yet , @xmath69 and @xmath55 grow with the binary s eccentricity .",
    "the corresponding contour lines indicate that for high binary eccentricities even small planetary semimajor axes can produce similar am peak signal strength .",
    "similarly , planets with larger distances to their host stars can still cause similar rv amplitudes if the binary s eccentricity is sufficiently large .",
    "if a fixed detection limit is set , e.g. @xmath94 m / s , planets with semimajor axes up to @xmath95 au could still be found around stars similar to @xmath0 cen a , assuming a binary eccentricity of @xmath96 . to produce a similarly high rv amplitude",
    ", a circular planet has to orbit its host star at roughly @xmath97 au ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in other words , high binary eccentricities lead to excited planetary eccentricities which in turn increase the peak signal strengths suggesting that binary - planet interactions can actually improve the chances for detecting terrestrial planets .",
    "naturally , if the planet s eccentricity happens to be close to zero at the time of observation , this advantage is nullified .    the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the same setup with rms signal strengths @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . while @xmath98 is independent of the binary s eccentricity , it is evident from equation ( [ eq : rhorms ] ) that @xmath99 depends weakly on @xmath85 since @xmath100 for the cases considered and therefore @xmath101 ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] , _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the slight curvature of the contour lines representing the rms signal in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicates this behavior .",
    "a summery of rv and am signal strengths for an earth - like planet at the boundaries of @xmath0 centauri s hz is presented in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we illustrated in this section that the dynamical interactions between a terrestrial planet and the secondary star can produce large peak amplitudes which may enhance the detectability of the planet with the rv and am methods considerably .",
    "the rms values of the planet s am and rv signals , on the other hand , remain almost unaffected by the gravitational influence of the secondary star .      to assess the detectability of a terrestrial planet in the hz of @xmath0 centauri ab ( and similar binaries ) through transit photometry , we calculated the relative transit depths that an earth - like planet would produce during its transit .",
    "if such a system hosted a transiting terrestrial planet , td values would range around 55 ppm for @xmath0 cen a , and 115 ppm for @xmath0 cen b. such transit depths are detectable by nasa s _ kepler _ telescope for instance  stellar and instrumental sources included  as the spacecraft s median noise level amounts to @xmath102 29 ppm @xcite .",
    "therefore , earth - like planets could in theory be found around @xmath0 centauri stars .",
    "however , _",
    "kepler _ was not designed to observe stars with apparent magnitudes between 0 and 3 such as those of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the tess mission ( transiting exoplanets survey satellite ) , for instance , will aim for tp of brighter stars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the example of _ kepler _ suggests that the detection of transiting habitable planets in s - type systems would be possible using current technology .",
    "in fact , very much similar to the cases discussed in the previous sections , the eccentricity excitation that an earth - like planet experiences in a binary star system may enhance its possibility of detection via transit photometry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . assuming @xmath0 centauri was a transiting system @xcite . ]",
    ", a comparison of the transit probabilities of actual planetary orbits to circular orbits shows that an 18% increase in @xmath103 values seems possible for terrestrial planets at the outer edge of @xmath0 cen a s ahz ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "given the right orbital configuration , it may be more likely to identify a transiting habitable terrestrial planet around a stellar component of a binary than around a single star assuming similar initial planetary eccentricities .",
    "the increase in transit probability for planets in double star systems is less dramatic when the equations are averaged over all possible configurations of the argument of pericenter as in equation ( [ eq : prob4 ] ) .",
    "averaged transit probabilities are represented by the straight lines in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "as @xmath104 , for terrestrial planets orbits with @xmath105 , the chance for transit is in general higher for earth - like planets in binary stars than for terrestrial planets in circular orbits around single stars .",
    "comparing the quantitative estimates of rv , am and tp signals , tp seems to be the best choice for finding earth - like planets in the hzs of a coplanar s - type binary configuration with sun - like components . even for a system as near as @xmath0 centauri ,",
    "am peak signals only measure @xmath49as . unfortunately ,",
    "neither eso s vlbi with prima , nor esa s gaia mission will be able to deliver such precision in the near future @xcite .",
    "gaia s aim to provide @xmath49as astrometry will most likely not be achieved until the end of the mission @xcite .",
    "also , from an astrometric point of view , earth - like planets would be easier to find around @xmath0 cen a than @xmath0 cen b. that is because the hz around star a is more distant from this star . naturally , the opposite is true for rv detections . due to the difference in the stellar masses , @xmath0 cen",
    "b offers a better chance of finding a terrestrial planet there using rv techniques .",
    "the recent discovery of an earth - sized planet around this star supports our results . the observed planetary rv signal was reproduced excellently by our analytic estimates for circular planetary orbits .",
    "our prediction of rv amplitudes for terrestrial planets around @xmath0 cen b are also in good agreement with those presented by @xcite .",
    "the four terrestrial planets used in the rv model by these authors produce almost exactly four times the predicted rms amplitude given in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "@xcite claim that earth - like planets in the @xmath0 centauri are detectable even for signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) of single observations below 0.1 .",
    "however , obtaining sufficient data to reconstruct the planetary signal requires a great amount of dedicated observing time ( approximately 5 years in their example ) . validating this statement",
    ", it took @xcite about 4 years of acquired data to detect @xmath0 cen bb .",
    "the data published by @xcite also allow a glimpse on the current performance of the harps spectrograph revealing a precision around @xmath106 cm / s .",
    "given the fact that the rv signal of a habitable planet around @xmath0 cen b would be still half an order of magnitude smaller ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , considerably more observation time would be required to identify habitable companions .",
    "hires measurements are currently yielding precisions around @xmath107 m / s . identifying rv signals of habitable worlds around @xmath0 cen b therefore seems even more unlikely when using hires .",
    "the previous examples show that some development of observational capacities is still necessary to achieve the rv resolution required for discovering habitable planets in the @xmath0 centauri system .",
    "the success of nasa s _ kepler _ space telescope in identifying countless earth - sized planetary candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that require follow - up observations might provide the necessary momentum to develop instruments capable of resolving rv signals in the range of cm / s . focusing on less massive binaries",
    "would have the advantage of having greatly enhanced rv signals as the hzs will be situated closer to the planet s host stars .",
    "how far this might simplify the task of finding habitable worlds will be the topic of further investigations .    in regard to transit photometry , both _",
    "kepler _ and corot telescopes have proven that it is possible to find terrestrial planets around sun - like stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of proven technology and the presented argument that the dynamical environment in binary star systems will enhance transit probabilities makes photometry currently the most promising method for finding earth - like planets in the hzs of s - type binary star systems .",
    "in this work , we provided an analytic framework to estimate the detectability of a terrestrial planet using radial velocity ( rv ) , astrometry ( am ) , as well as transit photometry ( tp ) in coplanar s - type binary configurations .",
    "we have shown that the gravitational interactions between the stars of a binary and a terrestrial planet can improve the chances for the planet s detection .",
    "the induced changes in the planet s eccentricity enhance not only rv and am peak amplitudes , but also the probability to witness a planetary transit .",
    "next to the presented `` best case '' estimates , we offered rms / averaged expressions which are deemed to be more suited to determine the long - term influence of the second star on planetary fingerprints in s - type systems .",
    "in contrast to peak amplitudes , the rms of a planet s am signal is only modified slightly by the additional gravitational interaction with the second star .",
    "a similar behavior can be seen in planetary transit probabilities .",
    "the rms values of rv signals are altogether independent of the secondary s gravitational influence , assuming that the system is nearly coplanar .    after defining the permanent , extended , and average habitable zones for both stellar components of the @xmath0 centauri system",
    ", we investigated the possible interaction between the newly discovered @xmath0 cen bb and additional terrestrial companions in @xmath0 cen b s hz . our results suggest that @xmath0 cen bb is on an orbit with very low eccentricity which would not be influenced significantly by habitable , terrestrial companions .",
    "conversely , @xmath0 cen bb s presence would also not affect earth - like planets in the habitable zone of @xmath0 cen b.    we estimated the maximum and rms values of the rv as well as am signal for a terrestrial planet in the @xmath0 centauri habitable zones .",
    "the peak and rms amplitudes of the rv signal ranged between @xmath108 and @xmath109 cm / s .",
    "astrometric signals were estimated to lie between @xmath107 and 5 @xmath49as . given the current observational facilities , enormous amounts of observing time would be required to achieve such precisions . if the @xmath0 centauri was a transiting system , however , a habitable planet could be detectable using current technologies .",
    "it seems that the detection of earth - like planets in circumstellar habitable zones of binaries with sun - like components via astrometry and radial velocity is still somewhat beyond our grasp , leaving photometry to be the only current option in this respect .",
