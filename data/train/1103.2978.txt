    "multiferroic materials , having coexisting magnetism and ferroelectricity , are of great technological and fundamental importance ,  @xcite given the prospect of controlling charges by applying magnetic fields and spins by voltages .",
    "bicoo@xmath1 was recently synthesized by a high - pressure ( hp ) technique ,  @xcite and it has been suggested to be a promising multiferroic material by uratani @xmath4 @xmath5  @xcite and by ravindran @xmath4 @xmath5  @xcite both through first - principles berry - phase calculations .",
    "bicoo@xmath1 has a giant tetragonal lattice distortion of @xmath6/@xmath7 = 1.27 with remarkable off - center atomic displacements ( see the inset of fig .",
    "1 ) , and it is an insulator having c - type antiferromagnetism below 470 k  the antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath8 layers stacking ferromagnetically along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "@xcite    it was proposed  @xcite that the giant tetragonal distortion originates from lifting of the orbital degeneracy of the high - spin ( hs , @xmath9=2 ) co@xmath3 ions and is stabilized by the subsequent @xmath2-type ferro - orbital ordering .",
    "note that orbitally degenerate transition - metal oxides quite often display an orbital ordering ( oo ) but ferroelectric ( fe ) materials out of them are rare , as ferroelectricity and magnetism seem , and actually in most cases , to exclude each other .",
    "@xcite therefore , the proposed mechanism for the giant fe distortion appears not straightforward . using fixed - spin - moment density - functional calculations ,",
    "ravindran @xmath4 @xmath5  @xcite predicted that there is a giant magnetoelectric coupling in bicoo@xmath1 : an external electric field ( or a small volume compression of @xmath105% ) can induce a strong magnetic response by changing the magnetic co@xmath3-hs state in the fe phase into a nonmagnetic low - spin ( ls , @xmath9=0 ) state in a paraelectric ( pe ) phase .",
    "a corresponding hs - insulator / ls - metal transition was also suggested .",
    "@xcite in sharp contrast , a very recent hp study  @xcite showed that bicoo@xmath1 even under 6 gpa with a large volume decrease of 18% is still semiconducting .",
    "note however that controversial spin states , both ls and intermediate - spin ( is , @xmath9=1 ) , were suggested for the hp phase .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we seek the origin of the giant tetragonal fe distortion in the ambient phase of bicoo@xmath1 and identify the nature of the pressure induced spin - state transition , using two sets of configuration - state - constrained gga+@xmath0 ( generalized gradient approximation plus hubbard @xmath0 ) calculations .",
    "our results show that the giant tetragonal distortion is driven by a strong bi - o covalency ( rather than by the aforementioned lifting of orbital degeneracy ) and is further stabilized by an @xmath2-type oo of the hs co@xmath3 ions .",
    "moreover , we find that the pressure - induced spin - state transition is via a mixed hs+ls state , which accounts for the available experimental results consistently and disproves a recent prediction of a readily switchable hs - ls transition .",
    "we used the structural data of bicoo@xmath11 measured by the neutron power diffraction .",
    "@xcite our calculations were performed using the full - potential augmented plane - wave plus local - orbital code wien2k .",
    "@xcite the muffin - tin sphere radii were chosen to be 2.3 , 1.9 , and 1.4 bohr for bi , co , and o atoms , respectively ( 1.0 bohr for o when calculating the @xmath12-@xmath13 curves shown in fig .",
    "the cutoff energy of 16 ryd was set for the plane - wave expansion of interstitial wave functions , and 1200 * k * points in the first brillouin zone for the ambient structure with one formula unit ( f.u . ) and 300 * k * points for the hp phase with 4 f.u .",

    "the inset shows a unit cell of the experimental tetragonal structure.,width=226 ]    plain gga [ or local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) ] calculations  @xcite seem to qualitatively reproduce the c - type af and insulating ground state of bicoo@xmath1 in the ambient phase , which was ascribed to the strong hund - exchange stabilized hs state of the co@xmath3 ions ( and thus the af order and narrow bands ) and to the well split - off @xmath2-singlet orbital .",
    "however , the band gap of 0.6 ev and the co@xmath3 spin moment of 2.4 @xmath15 given by the gga / lsda calculations are much smaller than the experimental values of 1.7 ev and 3.2 @xmath15.@xcite moreover , a recent prediction of an insulator - metal transition in bicoo@xmath1 upon a volume decrease of @xmath105% made by gga / lsda calculations  @xcite has already been disproved by a very recent hp study ,  @xcite which shows that bicoo@xmath1 is still semiconducting even under 6 gpa with a large volume decrease of 18% .",
    "as seen below , the experimental values of both the band gap and the co@xmath3 spin moment are well reproduced by our gga+@xmath0 calculations .",
    "note also that bicoo@xmath1 has an apparent af order up to 470 k.@xcite all these suggest that bicoo@xmath1 should rather be categorized as a mott insulator , with its band gap determined primarily by hubbard @xmath0 , i.e. , strong correlation of the co @xmath16 electrons .    to account for the strong electronic correlation ,",
    "@xcite we have carried out gga+@xmath0 calculations throughout this paper . in particular , we used the configuration - state - constrained gga+@xmath0 method ,  @xcite which allows us to access different spin and orbital configuration states of the concern by initializing their corresponding density matrix and then doing self - consistent electronic relaxation .",
    "@xcite this method is quite useful for study of the spin and orbital physics present in transition - metal oxides .",
    "@xcite all the results shown below are obtained with @xmath0=6 ev and hund exchange @xmath17=0.9 ev .",
    "we note that our test calculations using other reasonable @xmath0 values ,  @xcite @xmath0=5 and 7 ev , gave qualitatively the same results .",
    "we first seek the origin of the giant tetragonal distortion by starting with our calculations assuming an ideal cubic structure ( space group @xmath18 ) having the same volume as the experimental ambient tetragonal structure .",
    "then we changed the @xmath6/@xmath7 ratio of the tetragonal structure ( keeping the volume unchanged ) in our calculations .",
    "all those calculations were carried out by setting a hypothetical ls state of the co@xmath3 ions , and by doing a full electronic and atomic relaxation for the cases of @xmath6/@xmath7 = 1.05 - 1.3 in a step of 0.05 , and for the experimental 1.27 as well .",
    "all the solutions are insulating .",
    "as the ls co@xmath3 has a closed sub - shell @xmath19 ( thus no orbital degeneracy ) and is an isotropic ion , we can use this set of ls - constrained gga+@xmath0 calculations as a computer experiment to probe mainly the bi - o covalent effect .",
    ".the total energies of bicoo@xmath1 ( in unit of ev / f.u . )",

    "the optimized atomic @xmath20-coordinates are also shown .",

    "those results suggest that either the pure ls or is state present in the 5.8 gpa phase  @xcite is not the case .",
    "reversely , if the pure ls state were present in the 5.8 gpa phase , it would give rise to a change of the spin state from the pure hs state in the ambient phase , @xmath21@xmath9=2 , being in disagreement with the observed @xmath21@xmath9=1.@xcite moreover , an absence of the is state is also not surprising , as ( 1 ) bicoo@xmath1 in the 5.8 gpa phase is free of a jahn - teller distortion ( that is expected for the localized is co@xmath3 ) ; ( 2 ) a half - metallic band structure of the is state ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) disagrees with the measured semiconducting behavior ;  @xcite and ( 3 ) up to now a definite example of the insulating is state appears still lacking , and even in the layered perovskites lasrcoo@xmath22 and la@xmath23sr@xmath24coo@xmath22 both having a strong tetragonal elongation of the co@xmath3o@xmath25 octahedra , the is state turns out not to be the ground state either ,  @xcite despite an is state might be intuitively expected .",
    "as such , the mixed hs+ls state is most probably present in the 5.8 gpa phase .",
    "an ideal 1:1 configuration of the mixed hs+ls state , with an average @xmath9=1 , well accounts for the observed change of the spin state .",
    "@xcite moreover , a g - type order of the hs and ls co@xmath3 ions ( each hs co ion is surrounded by six ls co ions , and vice versa ) , due to a bigger / smaller size of the hs / ls co@xmath3 ions , could help to gain an elastic energy , and the resultant co - o bondlengths are calculated to be 1.980 ( 1.930 ) , 1.976 ( 1.890 ) , and 1.948 ( 1.906 )    for the hs ( ls ) co@xmath3 ions along the local @xmath26 axes .",
    "note , however , that a long - range g - type order of the hs and ls co@xmath3 ions is hard to establish , as only single transition - metal species in a single charge state and in the identical octahedral coordinations , i.e. , solely co@xmath3 ions are involved .",
    "thus , the average co - o bondlengths of the mixed and disordered hs+ls state ( possibly with a short - range order due to a partial release of the lattice elasticity ) are also in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the calculated insulating gap of bicoo@xmath1 is reduced from 1.98 ev in the c - type af state of the ambient phase to 0.84 ev in the mixed hs+ls state ( see fig .",
    "4(c ) ) , which qualitatively accounts for the decreasing resistivity of bicoo@xmath1 under pressure .  @xcite     ion to a neighboring hs co@xmath3 and ( c ) from an ls co@xmath3 to an ls co@xmath27 , but a suppressed electron hopping ( b ) from an hs co@xmath3 to an ls co@xmath27 due to a spin blockade.,width=226 ]    note that when considering thermal excitation of electrons into the initially empty conduction band and holes left in the valence band for a nominally stoichiometric material , these electron excitations would in a localized picture correspond to hs co@xmath28 states and holes to ls co@xmath27 .",
    "they behave like hs co@xmath28 and ls co@xmath27  impurities \" in the matrix of the co@xmath3 ions . as a result , in the ambient phase of bicoo@xmath1 having the hs co@xmath3 matrix , only the hs co@xmath28  impurities \" can transfer their minority - spin @xmath29 electrons to the neighboring hs co@xmath3 , without changing the configuration states ( the initial and final states are the same ) , see fig .",
    "however , a hole hopping from the ls co@xmath27 to the hs co@xmath3 is significantly suppressed ( see fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , due to a cost of the hund exchange energy associated with a large change of the spin states which is referred as to a spin - blockade machanism .",
    "@xcite in contrast , in the hp phase having the mixed and disordered hs+ls co@xmath3 matrix , a charge hopping can take place both between the hs co@xmath28 and hs co@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) and between the ls co@xmath27 and ls co@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "5(c ) ) . this could also account for the decreasing resistivity of bicoo@xmath1 under pressure .",
    "our above results show that even in the 5.8 gpa phase of bicoo@xmath1 with a large volume decrease of 18% , the hs - to - ls transition is not yet complete , and the system is most probably in the mixed hs+ls insulating state , but not in the pure - ls metallic state which was predicted by the previous gga / lsda calculations for bicoo@xmath1 upon a volume decrease of @xmath305% .",
    "@xcite as we discussed above , bicoo@xmath1 is rather a mott insulator , and thus the previous gga / lsda results are somewhat questionable : particularly the predicted metallic solution was already disproved by a very recent experiment .  @xcite recent fixed - spin - moment calculations even predicted that bicoo@xmath1 could have a giant magnetoelectric coupling with a readily switchable hs - ls transition associated with an electric field driven fe - pe transition .",
    "@xcite we note that the prediction may simply be an artifact of the fixed - spin - moment calculations , as ( 1 ) lsda or gga ( it was mentioned as a density - functional method in ref  @xcite ) is not well suitable to describe this mott insulator ; ( 2 ) most probably those calculations were carried out in a wrong ferromagnetic metallic state ; and ( 3 ) their metallic solutions blurred the distinction between the different spin and orbital multiplets of the concern and thus suppressed significantly their level splittings and particularly the hs / ls splitting : the fixed - spin - moment calculations showed that for the ambient structure , the energy preference of the hs state over the ls state is less than 0.15 ev / f.u .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 in ref  @xcite ) , whereas the corresponding value we calculated is more than 0.5 ev / f.u .",
    "therefore , the previous prediction of the hs - to - ls transition in bicoo@xmath1 with a small volume decrease of @xmath105% was overly optimistic .",
    "@xcite instead , we find now that there is no readily switchable hs - ls transition is bicoo@xmath1 .",
    "-@xmath13 curves calculated by gga+@xmath0 for the c - type af state of bicoo@xmath1 in the ambient phase , and for the mixed hs+ls state and the ls state under high pressures .",
    "the lattice volume of the ambient phase is slightly overestimated within 3% , and the critical volume for a complete transition into the ls state is estimated to be about 53 @xmath31/f.u.,width=226 ]    as bi@xmath3 has a very similar ionic size as la@xmath3 , it is reasonable to assume that when the local co - o bondlengths of bicoo@xmath1 in the hp pe phase become identical to those of lacoo@xmath1 in the ls state at low temperature ( 1.925    at 5 k ) ,  @xcite a complete transition into the ls state would be achieved in bicoo@xmath1 .",
    "this , together with the structural data of the 5.8 gpa phase,@xcite allows us to estimate the critical volume to be about 52.8 @xmath31/f.u .",
    "( corresponding to a volume decrease of about 20% ) .",
    "then , by extrapolating the eye - guided line of the @xmath13-@xmath32 data points in the range of 2 - 6 gpa ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) in ref  @xcite ) , we may estimate the critical pressure to be about 8 gpa .",
    "it is important to note that the estimated critical volume is indeed well reproduced by our detailed calculations of the @xmath12-@xmath13 curves ( see fig .",
    "6 , @xmath33 53 @xmath31/f.u . ) , which also nicely reproduce the equilibrium volume of the ambient phase within 3% and clearly indicate the hs - to - ls transition via the mixed hs+ls state .",
    "this prediction of a complete transition into the ls state awaits a further hp study .",
    "to conclude , using configuration - state - constrained gga+@xmath0 calculations , we demonstrate that the giant tetragonal ferroelectric distortion of bicoo@xmath1 is driven by the strong bi - o covalency ( rather than by lifting of the orbital degeneracy of the hs co@xmath3 ions ) and is further stabilized by a subsequent @xmath2-type oo . moreover",
    ", our results show that the pressure induced hs - to - ls transition is via a mixed hs+ls state , and that the transition would be complete upon a large volume decrease of about 20% ( under about 8 gpa ) . the mixed hs+ls state well accounts for the available experimental results.@xcite",
