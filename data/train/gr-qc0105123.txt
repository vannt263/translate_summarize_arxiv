    "over the years there have been extensive studies carried out in the literature on the subject of static , spherically symmetric stars .",
    "these regular solutions consist of some spherical matter field smoothly patched to the schwarzschild vacuum solution at some surface outside the gravitational radius or event horizon .",
    "many of these solutions involve bodies composed of perfect fluids @xcite , some of which employ equations of state to supplement the equations of relativity .",
    "specific models of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse have also been of much interest since the pioneering work of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite .",
    "a collection of work regarding specific collapse models may be found in @xcite and other standard references .",
    "interestingly , some studies of collapsing spherically symmetric stars consisting of anisotropic fluid matter reveal a transition into exotic matter after collapsing past their event horizons ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "black holes of this type are known in the literature as exotic black holes .",
    "black hole interiors which are not singular at the classical level ( regular black holes ) have also been studied @xcite-@xcite . although it is believed that any serious candidate theory for quantum gravity must eliminate the singularity , it is instructive to study what criteria must be met at the classical level to remove this singularity .",
    "we present such solutions here as well as derive the general properties non - singular solutions must possess . for the above reasons , it is interesting to study the @xmath0-domain in more detail , especially addressing the issue of extreme exotic matter .",
    "it may be argued that the black hole evaporation process @xcite tends to reveal more of the black hole interior as time progresses .",
    "therefore , studies of the interior region have relevance to exterior observers in this way .",
    "the @xmath0-domain also provides an interesting arena in which to perform theoretical studies of matter under extreme gravitational conditions .",
    "this paper serves several purposes .",
    "first we present an investigation of the general @xmath0-domain .",
    "although much work has been done regarding spherical systems in the @xmath1-domain , relatively little analytic work has been performed on the @xmath0-domain .",
    "we believe it is useful to present the general local solution to the @xmath0-domain problem as it sheds light on some of the origins of the exotic matter phases mentioned above .",
    "it turns out that the presence of an apparent horizon induces drastic phase transitions in the matter field .",
    "also , it is hoped that the general solution will provide a useful starting point for future research in this area .    in the literature , analytic studies in this domain involve specific solutions which depend on the @xmath0 coordinate only , so called @xmath0-spheres which are eternal black holes .",
    "for examples of such studies the reader is referred to the interesting work by ruban @xcite @xcite and poisson and israel @xcite as well as references above .",
    "however , physically , a @xmath0-domain solution is expected to result from the gravitational collapse of an @xmath1-domain system ( some well behaved star ) .",
    "in other words , before the formation of an event horizon , the collapse is described by a metric depending on the exterior radial and time coordinate ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) .",
    "therefore , after the system has collapsed within its schwarzschild radius forming a black hole , the corresponding interior solution should also depend on both of these coordinates ( labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively in the @xmath0-domain ) .",
    "one particular solution constructed here does possess such dependence .",
    "the interesting particular solutions which are presented include the @xmath0-domain analogue of the constant density star . it is found that the corresponding matter in the @xmath0-domain possesses substantially different physical properties as will be discussed later in the paper .",
    "finally , we solve the @xmath0-domain equations to construct non - singular solutions , one of which depends on both the radial and time coordinate .",
    "the other regular solution may represent the late stages of collapse of a polytropic star which does _ not _ form a singularity .",
    "this study places some emphasis on the presence of exotic matter and the elimination of the central singularity is not a requirement of all solutions .",
    "these extreme matter phases are considered and studied in some detail as they are motivated by the collapse studies mentioned earlier and it is hoped that the analysis here will shed some light on the origin of such phases .",
    "this leads us to another motivation for this study : it is interesting to note that , when considering solutions which are well behaved in the @xmath1-domain , their extension into the @xmath0-domain is usually accompanied by _ exotic _ physical properties .",
    "we show that ordinary astrophysical systems can naturally form exotic systems after collapsing in a black hole .",
    "one simple example we demonstrate , in the general solution , is that demanding a well behaved schwarzschild mass measured by an observer in the @xmath1-domain requires material which possesses a local _",
    "we begin here with a brief analysis of the @xmath1-domain and present the general solution in this domain .",
    "this is useful as it will later be compared to the general @xmath0-domain solution which possesses substantially different physical properties even though , at first glance , the @xmath0-coordinate chart may seem very similar to the @xmath1-chart except for signs .",
    "the solution presented here allows for the study of any collapse model in the @xmath0-domain .",
