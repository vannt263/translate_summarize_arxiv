    "the non - flaring sun has been studied at radio wavelengths for several decades .",
    "( for a recent review , see _",
    "most of the quiescent solar microwave emission is due to free  free bremsstrahlung ( ff ) emission from the lower corona and upper chromosphere . at microwave frequencies , the quiet ",
    "sun emission can be modeled as an optically thin @xmath01 mk corona on top of an optically thick @xmath010000 k chromosphere ( _ e.g. _ ; but see and @xcite for a nuance ) . in active regions ( ar ) , an additional broadband gyroresonance component , typically peaking around 2800 ghz ( 10.7 cm ) , is present when the coronal magnetic field is strong enough @xcite . during flares , additional thermal bremsstrahlung and",
    "gyrosynchroton components occur ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "recent efforts to understand microwave emission from the sun s upper atmosphere have concentrated on either the spectral aspect , with multi - frequency measurements at sun center @xcite , or by studying its spatial profile at a few frequencies ( _ e.g. _ , , , for recent work on the topic ) .",
    "however the two approaches have not yet been reconciled into producing a density model that satisfactorily explains the equatorial limb profile in the whole microwave band , let alone the polar one .",
    "the 10.7 cm spatially integrated solar radio flux is known to be well correlated with the sunspot number ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "qualitatively , the reason is simple : active regions tend to have both enhanced densities ( leading to increased free",
    " free emission ) , and an additional gyroresonance ( gr ) component .",
    "but , to our knowledge , a systematic observational study of the fraction of the full - sun 10.7 cm flux that is due to gr and that is due to ff emission remains to be done .",
    "section  [ sect : ata ] of this article introduces the allen telescope array in the context of solar observations .",
    "section  [ sect : obs ] presents the three sets of ata solar observations obtained so far , including raw brightness temperature @xmath2 $ ] maps and equatorial / polar profiles . for comparison , cross - calibration with other instruments or semi - empirical models",
    "is also presented . in section  [",
    "sect : budget ] , a multi - frequency flux budget for each observation is presented , and the fraction of the solar 10.7 cm flux that is due to gyroresonance emission is determined . in section  [",
    "sect : ctbc ] , we derive `` coronal thermal bremsstrahlung contribution '' ( ctbc ) maps and profiles from observations , a format which facilitates cross - frequency comparisons , and allows for the quick discrimination between regions on the sun where only optically thin free  free emission is relevant , and regions where additional physics ( _ e.g. _ optical thickness , gyroresonance ) is present .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sect : ccl ] .",
    "the allen telescope array @xcite is a radio interferometer near hat creek , california , usa .",
    "it consists of 42 6.1-m antennas located in an optimized `` pseudo - random '' configuration within a 300-m diameter .",
    "two digital correlators can be tuned to analyze two 100-mhz wide bands ( 1024 channels each ) , independently chosen between 0.5 ghz and 11.2 ghz .",
    "each of these observing frequencies can be changed ( under computer control ) in a few seconds . through careful design , the interferometer system is phase - stable and is fully calibrated ( in amplitude and in phase ) with respect to standard cosmic sources .",
    "the gains and signal levels of the receivers and digital back - end can be reconfigured under computer control to handle expected solar signal levels .",
    "temporal resolution as high as one second is currently available from the correlators .",
    "the correlator output can be transformed into images through standard techniques using a well - developed data analysis package ( miriad : http://bima.astro.umd.edu / miriad/ ) for semi - automated calibration and mapping with pipeline software for flagging , calibration , and imaging specific to the ata @xcite .",
    "the ata is well - suited for imaging / spectroscopy of large  scale , slowly varying solar phenomena .",
    "it is the only instrument currently available that can provide instantaneous two - dimensional images of the full sun at frequencies near 2800 mhz .",
    "the 6.1-m antennas provide a field of view that scales with frequency ( @xmath3 ; _ viz .",
    "_ full - sun field of view when @xmath46 ghz ) .",
    "the interferometer s angular resolution also scales with frequency ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "even though this is insufficient to resolve the internal structure of active regions or burst sources , it is well - suited to separating the various spatial contributions from across the disk .",
    "furthermore , the compact array includes ( projected ) baselines as short as @xmath06 m , corresponding to fringe spacings as large as @xmath0one degree .",
    "therefore in addition to imaging , the system can provide information on large ",
    "scale structures ( _ e.g. _ coronal holes ) with size scales of 1020 arcminutes as well as an independent measurement of the total solar flux .",
    "although the ata has dual linearly polarized feeds , for this application the correlator combines these to measure circular polarization , thereby providing an additional diagnostic of solar sources .",

    ". the non - negligible level of polarization ( varying with frequency , peaking at 11% at 4.5 ghz ) in the ar is a good indicator that magnetobremsstrahlung emission is also present .",
    "as there is some spatial smearing happening ( ata hpbw at 6 ghz is @xmath045  , while the typical magnetic size scale in an ar is @xmath010  , ) , the degree of polarization may be underestimated .",
    ", width=453 ]    three sets of observations were taken :    1 .   *",
    "1-october-2009 * ( figure [ fig : img : oct01:4a ] ) : in this first test , the sun was observed for two minutes around 21:56:36 ut , at 2750 mhz only .",
    "no flare activity was detected during that time ( the goes x - ray digitization was bottoming out at the lowest observable a0.3 level ) .",
    "two small active regions were present , both near the western limb of the sun .",
    "* 29-january-2010 * ( figure [ fig : img : jan29:4a ] ) : the sun was observed with 31 antennas at 1430 , 2750 , and 3500 mhz , for @xmath015 minutes , from 21:44 to 22:01 ut .",
    "the goes x - ray level was low and stable between the a2 and a3 level ( no flares ) .",
    "radio solar telescope network ( rstn ) lightcurves were flat .",
    "the only feature is a single on - disk active region .",
    "* 21-march-2010 * ( figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a ] ) : the sun was observed at six frequencies centered at 1430 , 2100 , 2750 , 3500 , 4500 , and 6000 mhz , for eight hours beginning at 16:30 ut , in 1-minute intervals , alternating between frequency pairs .",
    "there were several active regions : a main on - disk ar ( `` a '' in figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a ] ) , and several smaller ones near both equatorial limbs ( `` b '' to `` d '' in figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a ] ) .",
    "the sun was slightly active : the goes x - ray baseline was a6a8 , and four small b - class flares ( b1.0 to b2.2 ) occurred during the time the data were accumulated .",
    "these have negligible influence on our results .",
    "we have also plotted the stokes @xmath6 maps for this observations ( figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a : v ] ) , which will be discussed in section  [ sect : budget ] .",
    "each ata map was cleaned @xcite around bright active region features , and the rest of the image ( @xmath0quiet sun ) was then treated with a maximum entropy method ( mem ) .",
    "image dynamic range ( ratio of brightest pixel to rms noise of image ) for the 21-mar-2010 observations is about 700 at 1430 mhz , and 250 at 6000 mhz .",
    "we discuss the accuracy of the flux calibration in the next sub - sections , by comparing total map fluxes to that given by other ( spatially integrated ) instruments ( section  [ sect : totmapflux ] ) , and by comparing the brightness temperature at sun center with other published results ( section  [ sect : tbsuncenter ] ) .",
    "we then say a few words about the brightness temperature profiles and stokes @xmath8 maps .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp : comparisons ] displays the total fluxes in each map at each frequency for all three periods of observations , with comparisons with other instruments : the 10.7 cm flux from penticton ( british columbia ) , the nobeyama radiopolarimeter ( norp ; japan ) , and two observatories that are part of the radio solar telescope network ( rstn ; palehua , hawaii and sagamore hill , massachussets ) , all adjusted to 1 au .",
    "there is generally good agreement , typically within the 1015% level .      .",
    "* 21-mar-2010 observations ( solid , blue ) center @xmath7 are higher than expected at low frequencies because of contribution from a nearby ar . the dashed , blue line was taken instead for pixels about 500  further south , corresponding to @xmath02 hpbw ( at 1430 mhz ) away from main ar .",
    "the value of @xmath7 around sun center is highly oscillatory ( spatially ) at high frequency , probably due to the lack of small baselines at these frequencies .",
    "taking the modes of the maps lead to values in between the extremes shown ( between the dashed and the solid blue lines ) .",
    ", width=453 ]    we compared the brightness temperature @xmath7 of the pixel nearest sun center to the results published by ( see figure  [ fig : sp : centerpixeltb ] ) .",
    "there is good agreement , except at 6 ghz , where we observe a high amount of on - disk spatial oscillations , and a low on - disk average brightness temperature , which we attribute to a lack of short baselines at these frequencies .",
    "hence , the values at high frequencies , particularly at 6 ghz , must be used with caution .",
    "we point out the equatorial limb brightening observed at all frequencies and for all three observations , and the absence of such at the poles .",
    "this has already been observed before ( _ e.g. _ ) , at higher spatial accuracy . despite this limitation",
    ", we note that ata s multi - frequency capability allows us to study limb brightening in a new light ( see introduction for references on the topic ) .",
    "we shall make a few comparisons with simple atmospheric models later in this work , but a thorough investigation is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "suffice it to say for now that the equatorial limb is thought to be brighter than the polar limb because the solar equator comprises many closed loops , which tend to retain plasma , while polar regions , predominently composed of `` open field lines '' where the plasma can easily escape with the solar wind , are less dense .",
    "figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a : v ] shows a clear and consistent circular polarization signature accross all frequencies for the disk ar ( source `` a '' ) , and are consistent with soho / mdi magnetic maps of the underlying photosphere .",
    "the maximum stokes @xmath8 occurs at 4.5 ghz , where it can reach 11% .",
    "this value is probably a lower limit , as there is certainly some spatial smearing in effect : the typical magnetic size scale in a sunspot is about 10  @xcite , but the instrumental resolution is about 1 at 4.5 ghz .",
    "furthermore , solar rotation moves the source horizontally by @xmath01 over the course of data accumulation .",
    "free  free thermal bremsstrahlung emission in active regions is not expected to be able to reach such high levels of circular polarizations ( _ e.g. _ gelfreikh , @xcite ) , and , in the absence of meaningful gyrosynchroton emission from radio bursts , we therefore conclude that it is mostly due to gyroresonance emission .",
    "tables  [ tab : budget : oct01 ] , [ tab : budget : jan29 ] , and [ tab : budget : mar21 ] contain a flux budget for the most prominent sources in each of the three observations .",
    "the `` full - sun '' flux was computed by adding together all pixel values within 1.3 @xmath9 of sun center .",
    "additionally , for the 21-mar-2010 observations , source spectra have been plotted ( figure  [ fig : sp : mar21 ] ) . as most of the features were spatially unresolved ( at least at the lowest frequencies ) , we have plotted the fluxes , @xmath10 , of each feature , instead of the more usual brightness temperatures .    .flux",

    "the frequency - dependence of the @xmath11 maps over the disk ar ( figures  [ fig : img : mar21:4c ] and [ fig : prof : jan29mar21:mainar ] ) and the presence of circular polarization ( figure  [ fig : img : mar21:4a : v ] ) further support this .",

    "we have established a multi - frequency flux budget , finding that a single active region amounted for up to @xmath08% of the total solar flux at 2750 mhz , the actual fraction varying with frequency and active region .    using the multi - frequency capability , a simple method to find regions of the sun where optically thin free  free emission dominates has been devised .",
    "regions where the @xmath11-value varies with frequency are likely regions with a gyroresonance component .",
