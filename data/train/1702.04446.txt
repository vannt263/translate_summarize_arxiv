    "psr j2032 + 4127 is a radio - loud gamma - ray - emitting pulsar discovered by the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) and it is a young pulsar with a spin period @xmath1ms , spin - down power @xmath2 and spin - down age @xmath3kyr ( abdo et al .",
    "this pulsar had been regarded as isolated pulsar ( camilo et al . 2009 ) because of the lack of apparent variation in its rotation caused by reasonable orbital motion .",
    "lyne et al . ( 2015 ) found the variation of the observed pulsar rotation rate , which is consistent with the doppler effect of the orbital motion around the high - mass be star mt91 213 .",
    "their study suggests that the orbital period is very long , @xmath4yr , and the orbit is extremely elongated with an eccentricity @xmath5 .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "2016 ) refined the orbit parameters as @xmath6years and @xmath7 ( see figure  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "psr  j2032 + 4127 is a member of a class of rare - type pulsar that is orbiting around a high - mass b star .",
    "the next periastron passage will occur in late 2017 or in early 2018 .",
    "the binary nature of psr  j2032 + 4127 is similar to that of psr  b1259 - 63 , which is a well known radio pulsar that is orbiting around the high - mass b star , ls2883 , with @xmath8years and @xmath9 ( johnston et al .",
    "1992 , 1999 , 2005 ) .",
    "psr b1259 - 63/ls2883 is known to be a source of non - pulsed and non - thermal emissions in the x - ray / gev / tev bands ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ; abdo et al .",
    "2011 ; tam et al .",
    "2011 , 2015 ) , and it is classified as a so - called gamma - ray binary , which comprises a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) and a high - mass ob star ( see dubus 2013 ) .",
    "multi - wavelength observations have confirmed several tev gamma - ray binaries , namely , psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 , ls5039 ( aharonian et al .",

    "psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213 is a candidate for the next gamma - ray binary , for which the compact object is definitely a young pulsar .",
    "the origin of the high - energy tev emissions from the psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883 system is likely related to the interaction of the pulsar wind of psr  b1259 - 63 and the be wind / disk of ls  2883 ( tavani & arons 1997 ; dubus 2006 , 2013 ) .",
    "their interaction results in the formation of a shock , where the ram pressures of the pulsar wind and of the stellar wind / disk are in balance ( figure  [ system ] ) .",
    "the electrons / positrons in the pulsar wind are accelerated at the shock , and produce nonthermal emissions in the radio to tev gamma - ray bands .",
    "the standard scenario assumes the synchrotron radiation and the inverse - compton scattering ( ics ) process produces radio / x - ray emission and tev gamma - ray emission , respectively .",
    "we can expect that psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213 is also a source of x - rays / tev gamma - rays arising from the same mechanisms .",
    "x - ray / tev emissions from the gamma - ray binaries have been observed to exhibit temporal variations in their emission .",
    "various models have been suggested to explain the energy - dependent orbital modulations : for the pulsar model of the gamma - ray binaries , for example , the doppler boosting effect due to the finite velocity of the shocked pulsar wind ( dubus et al .",
    "2010 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ; takata et al 2014a ) , evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic electrons of the shocked pulsar wind under the different energy - loss rates ( khangulyan et al .",
    "2007 ; takahashi et al . 2009 ; zabalza et al . 2013 ) , and the interaction between the pulsar wind and the be disk ( sierpowska - bartosika & bednarek 2008 ; takata et al .",
    "2012 ) , have been suggested . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the orbital variation of the emission from psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213 as a result of the radial evolution of the magnetization parameter ( takata & taam 2009 ; kong et al .",
    "2011 ) or the variation of the momentum ratio of the two winds .    the gev emission from psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213 is modulating with the spin period of the pulsar , and hence is dominated bythe magnetospheric process .",
    "the gev emission from the gamma - ray binaries has been observed by the fermi - lat .",
    "for psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883 , flare - like gev emissions have been observed after the second be disk passage of the pulsar ( abdo et al .",
    ", 2011 ; tam et al .",
    "2011 , 2015 ) . although the inverse - compton scattering process with anisotropic soft - photon field from the disk / companion star ( e.g khangulyan et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 ; van soelen et al .",
    "2012 ; dubus & cerutti 2013 ) or synchrotron radiation process of the relativistic electrons / positrons ( chernyakova et al . 2015 ; xing et al .",
    "2016 ) have been considered , the origin of the emission is not yet understood .",
    "the gamma - binary ls  5039 , whose orbital period is @xmath11days , is a candidate for which the compact object is a young pulsar .",
    "the gev emission from this system has been observed over the whole orbital phase by the fermi - lat ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) . because their spectral shape measured by fermi resembles those of the gamma - ray emitting pulsars ,",
    "it has been suggested that ls 5039 includes a young pulsar .",
    "the orbital modulating gev emission confirmed by fermi , however , suggests the emission process in the intra - binary space .",
    "the orbital modulations of gev and x - ray / tev emissions from ls  5039 show anti - correlation : gev flux ( or x / tev fluxes ) becomes maximum around the superior conjunction ( hereafter supc ) ( or inferior conjunction ( infc ) ) and becomes minimum around the infc ( or supc ) . within the framework of the shock emission due to the interaction between the pulsar wind and stellar wind",
    ", the observed modulation of the x - ray emissions from gamma - ray binary ls  5039 has been interpreted as the doppler boosting effect caused by the finite velocity of the shocked pulsar wind ( dubus et al .",
    "2010 ; takata et al .",
    "2014a ) , while the strong absorption of the tev photons by the stellar photon field will suppress the observed emissions at around supc ( dubus et al .",
    "the gev emission may be as a result of the inverse - compton scattering ( hereafter ics ) process of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind ( sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2008 ; kapala et al .",
    "2010 ; torres 2011 ; takata et al .",
    "2014a ) or of the shock - accelerated particles ( yamaguchi & takahara ; zabalza et al .",
    "the ics process between the relativistic particles and the stellar photons causes a flux peak in the observed modulation at around the supc ( if there is no absorption ) , where the scattering process of the relativistic particles that propagate to the earth occurs the head - on , and causes a flux minimum around the infc , where the scattering is a tail - on collision process . in this paper",
    ", we will estimate the contribution of the inverse - compton scattering process between the cold - relativist pulsar wind and the stellar photon , since the gamma - ray binary will provide a unique laboratory to investigate the properties of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind at the au distance scale from the pulsar ( cerutti et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the high - mass companion in the gamma - ray binaries is of the order @xmath12 .",
    "this intense stellar photon field leads to not only observable tev emissions through the ics , but also substantial @xmath13 absorption of tev gamma - rays . because the stellar radiation field is anisotropic in the emission region , the emissivity of the ics and optical depth of the photon - photon pair - creation process integrated along the line of sight depend on the orbital phase .",
    "such anisotropic processes will cause the observed orbital modulation of tev gamma - rays ( e.g. kirk et al .",
    "1999 ; bednarek 2000 ; takata et al .",
    "the secondary pairs created by the primary tev gamma - rays are also a source of very high - energy photons through the ics process .",
    "a pair - creation cascade process may develop in the stellar wind region and may cause the observed tev emissions from the close binary systems ( bednarek 1997 , 2007 ; sierpowska & bednarek 2005 ; sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2007 , 2008 ; yamaguchi & takahara 2010 ; cerutti et al .",
    "2010 ) and a periastron passage of the long - orbit binaries ( sierpowska - bartosik & bednarek 2008 ) .",
    "the anti - correlation between the gev and tev light curves of ls  5039 has been interpreted by using this cascade model ( bednarek 2007 )    in the x - ray bands , the observed temporal variations along the orbit will be mainly caused by the variations of the physical conditions of the pulsar wind at the shock . with the extremely elongated orbit of psr  b1259 - 63 and psr  j2032 + 4127 , the distance of the shock ( @xmath14 ) from the pulsar varies by about a factor of ten along the orbit ( figure  [ shock ] ) .",
    "hence we can in principle use gamma - ray binaries to probe the physical properties of the pulsar wind ( e.g. magnetization parameter and bulk lorentz factor ) as a function of radial distance .",
    "for example , the pulsar wind magnetization parameter ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) can be determined as @xmath15 where , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the magnetic field , number density and lorentz factor of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind , respectively , just before the shock .",
    "we can probe how the magnetization parameter changes with the radial distance from the pulsar by examining the observed temporal variations ( takata & taam 2009 ; kong et al .",
    "2011 ) . since psr  j2032 +",
    "4127 is now approaching to the periastron passage that will occur in late 2017 or early 2018 , and since the separation between psr  j2032 + 4127 and mt91  213 changes by about a factor of ten during @xmath191year and @xmath20year from the periastron ( figures  [ orbit ] and  [ shock ] ) , we can expect that the change of the shock distance from the pulsar will cause a large variation in the observed emission from this system , as indicated by the results of the recent x - ray observations done by the swift ( section  [ observations ] , see also ho et al .",
    "2016 ) . moreover , the ics process of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind before the shock may boost the stellar photons from optical to gamma - ray bands",
    ". the next periastron passage may provide u with s a unique opportunity to constrain the lorentz factor @xmath18 of the pulsar wind .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ observations ] , we will analyze the data taken from the swift and fermi - lat .",
    "we will confirm that the x - ray emission observed in 2016 is about factor of ten larger than that from previous observations , while the gev flux does not show any significant change . in section  [ model ] , we describe our emission models from the intra - binary shock and cold - relativistic pulsar wind . in section",

    "since the tev photons from the shock are produced by the ics process , the asymmetry is introduced by the dependence of the collision angle between the stellar photons and the shocked pulsar wind particles that emit the photons toward the earth , as in the case with the orbital modulation of the ics of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind ( figure  [ cpw ] ) .    for the tev photons ,",
    "the optical depth of the pair - creation process depends on the orbital phase , and it becomes the maximum at the supc for the photons traveling toward the earth .",

    "the finite velocity of the shocked pulsar wind will cause the doppler boosting effect , which enhances or suppresses the observed emissions .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed modulation of the x - ray emissions from gamma - ray binary ls  5039 is a result of the doppler boosting effect ( dubus et al .",
    "2010 ; takata et al 2014a ) .",
    "the doppler factor is calculated from @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the lorentz factor of the bulk motion of the post - shocked flow , and @xmath210 is the angle of the flow direction and the line of sight .",

    "it has been discussed that a radiatively non - stationary acceleration process produces the clumping ( small - scale density inhomogeneity ) of the stellar wind from the high - mass star ( runacres & owocki 2002 : owocki & cohen 2006 ) .",
    "it was analyzed that the typical size of a clump at the stellar surface is @xmath219 , and may linearly expand with the radial distance .",
    "a larger structure of clumps could be formed in the wind due to difference production mechanisms , magnetic field inhomogeneities , and star s rotation / pulsation ( see bosch - ramon 2013 ) .",
    "although the clumps fill only a small fraction of the volume of the wind region , it is thought that they carry most of mass ejected from the star , and have a mass density larger than the average density of the wind .",
    "studies with hydrodynamic simulations have shown that the clumping could develop in size and mass density due to merging between dense shells as traveling from the star , although it was also pointed out that a break - up of the dense shell as a consequence of the rayleigh - taylor or thin - shell instability limits the clump growth ( bozzo et al .",
    "2016 , and references therein ) .",
    "if a clumpy wind is formed in a high - mass binary system hosting a compact object , it is expected that the irregularity of the mass density in the stellar wind will cause a temporal evolution of the momentum ratio ( @xmath218 ) , yielding the temporal variations in the shock emissions ( owocki et al . 2009 ; bosch - ramon 2013 ; de la cita et al .",

    "this is because the synchrotron cooling time scale for tev leptons becomes shorter than the ics cooling and adiabatic cooling time scales at the shock for the pulsar / be disk interaction . at the periastron , for example , the shock distance at the apex for the pulsar / be wind interaction is @xmath260 , for which the inverse - compton cooling and adiabatic cooling time scales of tev electrons",
    "are shorter than the synchrotron cooling time scale ( figure  [ cool ] ) .",
    "for pulsar / be disk interaction , the shock distance becomes @xmath261 , which increases the magnetic field at the shock by a factor of @xmath262 , and hence decreases the synchrotron cooling time scale by about @xmath263 . as a result , the ics cooling scale , which is less sensitive to the shock distance , becomes longer than the synchrotron time scale , and the ics emissivity is suppressed .      as we discussed in section  [ disk ] , if the base density of the disk is high enough , the pulsar wind will be confined within a small region by the be disk matter .",
    "when the radius of the cavity estimated in figure  [ bow ] is less than the radius below which the kinetic energy of the disk gas is less than the gravitational potential energy of the pulsar , the disk matter may be gravitationally captured by the pulsar , and results in the formation of a disk around the pulsar . the capture radius measured from the pulsar",
    "may be estimated as @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the mass of the pulsar and @xmath92 is the relative velocity of the pulsar with respect to the disk matter . near the periastron , @xmath93au , the orbital velocity of the pulsar is @xmath266 .",
    "the velocities of the kepler motion and the radial velocity of the be disk at the pulsar position are of the order of @xmath267 and @xmath268 , respectively ( okazaki et al . 2011 ) .",
    "hence , we expect that the relative velocity is of order of @xmath269 , although this depends on the disk geometry and the rotation direction .",
    "as figure  [ bow ] shows , at near the periastron , where the separation is @xmath93au , the estimated shock distance due to the pulsar / be disk interaction is of order of @xmath270 au for @xmath271 , suggesting the disk matter could be captured by the pulsar because @xmath272 .",
    "the accretion rate may be estimated as @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the geometrical factor and we used the parameter at @xmath275au ( typical separation during the periastron passage ) with @xmath276 .",
    "we note that for the stellar wind , @xmath277 , the capture radius becomes @xmath278au , which is usually smaller than the shock radius due to the pulsar wind and stellar wind interaction ( figure  [ shock ] ) .",
    "hence the stellar wind will not be captured by the pulsar .",
    "there will be an relative angular momentum of the captured matter with respect to the pulsar , indicating the captured matter forms a circular orbit around the pulsar at a distance ( @xmath279 ) where the relative angular momentum per unit mass is equal to the angular momentum of the kepler orbit around the pulsar , @xmath280 .",
    "the angular frequency of the orbital motion of the pulsar is @xmath281 .",
    "the angular frequency of the circular orbit of the be disk around the b - star is also @xmath282 , because @xmath283 . roughly speaking , therefore , the angular frequency associated with the relative angular momentum will be of the order of @xmath284 , although again it depends on the disk geometry and rotation direction .",
    "the circularization radius of the captured matter may be estimated as ( frank et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath285    if we apply the standard shakura - sunyaev disk model , the disk matter will move inward with a dynamical time scale @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the viscous parameter in units of 0.1 , suggesting the accreting matter will take several weeks to reach the pulsar after the capture event . if the dynamical time scale ( @xmath288 ) is longer than the pulsar s disk crossing time scale , which may be of the order of @xmath289 , the accretion disk may not develop around the pulsar .",
    "we note however that the circularization radius given by equation  ( [ circ ] ) is sensitive to the relative velocity ; with @xmath290 cm , for example , @xmath291  cm , which is inside of the light cylinder . moreover , we do not know the geometry of the disk .",
    "if the disk plane is parallel to the orbital plane , the pulsar / be disk continues to interact during the periastron passage .",
    "hence it is possible that the accretion disk develops with a radial length @xmath292 around the pulsar at the periastron passage .    if the accretion disk forms around the pulsar , the disk supplies uv photons in the pulsar wind region .",
    "figure  [ bb ] summarizes the radiation power ( @xmath293 ) for the accretion disk ( solid line ) , stellar surface ( dashed line ) , and be disk ( dotted line ) .",
    "for the accretion disk , we assume an accretion rate @xmath294 and the disk extends from the light cylinder @xmath295 of the pulsar to @xmath296 . for the stellar emission",
    ", we assume the planck function with @xmath297k and @xmath96 .",
    "for the be disk emissions , we assumed the disk temperature @xmath298 after the calculation of carciofi & bjorkman ( 2006 ) .",
    "we ignore the effects of the emission and absorption lines on the spectra .",
    "as discussed in above , the captured matter will take about several weeks to reach the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "before the accretion disk reaches to the light cylinder radius , the rotation activity of the pulsar is still turned on and produces the cold - relativist pulsar wind .",
    "then we can expect that the ics process of the cold - relativistic pulsar will boost up the uv photons from the disk to the higher energy photon .",
    "figure  [ cpdisk ] summarizes the calculated spectra ( left panel ) and the integrated flux as a function of the accretion disk inclination angle ( right panel ) .",
    "the figure shows the results when the accretion disk extends from the light cylinder radius @xmath295 to @xmath296 .",
    "in addition , we assumed the mono - energetic distribution of the particles in the cold - relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "we took into account the energy loss of the pulsar wind due to the ics process .",
    "as figure  [ cpdisk ] shows , if the initial lorentz factor is @xmath299 which produces the scattered photons with 1 - 10gev energy , the calculated flux level can reach an order of @xmath300 , which is comparable to that of the pulsed emissions .",
    "pulsar binary systems may provide a valuable laboratory to study the accretion process on rapidly spinning and strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "one may consider that once the accretion disk crosses the light cylinder , the rotation - powered activity would be quenched .",
    "this is because the copious plasma fills the acceleration region at the rotation - powered stage , where the charge density deviates from the so - called goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "however , the recent observation suggests the rotation - powered activities and the accretion disk can co - exist in the magnetosphere .",
    "a transient - millisecond pulsar is a binary millisecond pulsar with low mass companion star , and it transits between the rotation - powered stage and the accretion stage ( archibald et al . 2009 ) . psr  j1023 + 0038 transited from its rotation powered stage to the accretion stage at the latter in 2013 june , when the pulsed radio emission from this pulsar disappeared ( stappers et al .",
    "coherent pulsed x - ray emission discovered after 2013 june suggests an accretion of matter on the neutron star surface ( archibald et al .",
    "jaodand et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , however , found that the spin - down rate in the accretion stage is higher than that in the rotation - powered stage , and they concluded that the rotation activity is still operating in the accretion stage .",
    "enhancement of observed gev emission in the accretion stage also suggests the survival of the rotation activity in the accretion stage ( takata et al .",
    "this model was also applied to another transient - millisecond pulsar psr j1227 - 4853 ( bednarek 2015 ) .",
    "gamma - ray binaries with a be companion may also offer opportunities to study this accretion process on young pulsars .",
    "the ics model of the pulsar wind could provide an explanation for the origin of the flare - like gev emissions from psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system after the second be disk passage of the pulsar .",
    "it has been observed that the gev peak in the orbital modulation occurs @xmath301 days after the x - ray peak ( tam et al .",
    "2011 , 2015 ) .",
    "it has been considered that the phase of the x - ray peak corresponds to that of the pulsar / be disk interaction .",
    "so we may expect that the be disk matter starts to be captured by the pulsar around the orbital phase of the x - ray peak .",
    "since it will take several weeks to fully develop the accretion disc around the pulsar , the gev peak position will delay from the x - ray peak position .",
    "finally , the magnetic radius @xmath302 from the pulsar is defined as the distance where the dipole magnetic field of the pulsar begins to dominate the dynamics of the accreting matter , and it is estimated from @xmath303 with @xmath304 and @xmath305 , @xmath306 this radius is smaller than the light cylinder radius of psr  j2032 + 4127 ( @xmath307 cm ) . the co - rotation radius ( @xmath308 ) is defined as the distance where the angular velocity of keplerian motion is equal to the spin angular velocity of the pulsar , namely @xmath309 which will be smaller than the magnetic radius , suggesting the accretion process is in propeller regime , and not all infalling matter will accrete on the pulsar surface .",
    "the outflow due to the propeller effect also could cause the high - energy emission ( e.g. papitto & torres , 2015 ) .    in summary",
    ", we analyzed the swift and fermi - lat data of the psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213 binary system , which is a candidate to be another tev gamma - ray binary .",
    "the x - ray flux has rapidly increased as the pulsar approaches periastron , which will occur in late 2017 or early 2018 , while the gev flux measured by fermi - lat shows no significant change .",
    "we investigated the x - ray emission by the synchrotron process of the pulsar wind particles accelerated at the shock due to the pulsar wind and stellar wind interaction .",
    "we argued that the increase in the observed x - rays is caused by ( 1 ) variation of the momentum ratio of the two winds along the orbital phase or ( 2 ) the evolution of the magnetization parameter of the pulsar wind with the radial distance as @xmath233 and @xmath310 .",
    "the current model predicts that the peak fluxes in the 0.3 - 10kev and 0.1 - 10tev energy bands are of the order of @xmath311 .",
    "the gamma - ray binary system could provide a unique laboratory to study the emissions from the cold - relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "the current model suggests that the ics process of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind could contribute to the fermi - lat observations at the periastron passage ( figure  [ gevlight ] ) . for this binary system ,",
    "the pulsar / be disk interaction will affect to the observed emissions , provided that the base density of the be disk is @xmath312 and the interaction occurs during @xmath313days and @xmath314days .",
    "for a be disk with higher base density @xmath89 , the pulsar / be disk interaction could form an accretion disk around the pulsar .",
    "the ics process of the cold - relativistic pulsar wind off the uv from the disk also provides the high - energy emission from the pulsar / be star binary system .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations will provide a unique opportunity to probe the pulsar wind properties and the various emission processes caused by the pulsar / be wind and pulsar / be disk interactions .",
    "we express our appreciation to an anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions .",
