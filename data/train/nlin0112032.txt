    "it is commonly believed that under parameter variation the turbulent dynamics in multi - dimensional systems may arise via quasiperiodicity , in a course of subsequent birth of oscillatory components with incommensurate frequencies , followed by chaotization ( see e.g. , the works of landau , hopf , and ruelle and takens [ 1,2,3 ] ) .",
    "now it is well known that actual details of the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos are very subtle and complicated . some of them can be revealed if we turn to a kind of restricted problem : suppose that the system may be decomposed to a master subsystem with quasiperiodic behavior and a driven slave subsystem , and the last can demonstrate transition to chaos .",
    "so , we may ask what are possible scenarios of the onset of chaos in the second subsystem ? ( note an analogy with an approach to the problem of three bodies in celestial mechanics : being difficult in a general formulation , it allows essential advance in a restricted version , under a suggestion that one of the bodies is of negligible mass . )",
    "one of the important results on this way of reasoning was a formulation of the concept of strange nonchaotic attractor ( sna ) , which typically appears in an intermediate region between order and chaos [ 4 - 6 ] . in the phase space",
    "this is an object of fractal geometrical structure , but without instability in respect to the initial conditions in the driven system .",
    "one more essential idea consists in application of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach , proven to be very efficient for understanding dynamics in critical states between order and chaos ( e.g. [ 7 - 16 ] ) . starting with an evolution operator for some definite time interval we are able to construct the evolution operator for a larger interval .",
    "then , we try to produce an appropriate variable change to make the new operator as close as possible to the original .",
    "this is just one step of the rg transformation , and it may be repeated again and again to obtain operators for larger and larger time intervals . as a result , we arrive at some universal operator , which describes long - time evolution of the system at the criticality .",
    "it is often represented by a fixed point of the rg transformation .",
    "studies of this fixed - point operator together with consideration of its relevant perturbations reveal properties of universality and scaling for the transition .",
    "originally , such an approach was developed by feigenbaum for the period - doubling scenario of the onset of chaos [ 7,8 ] ; afterwards it was applied to many other situations , including quasiperiodicity at the chaos border [ 10 - 12 ] and some cases of the birth of sna [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "finally , we have to mention here a concept of intermittency suggested by pomeau and manneville [ 17 ] .",
    "it occurs in very general circumstances near a saddle - node bifurcation ( also called tangent bifurcation , preferably in the context of 1d maps ) .",
    "it has been studied in different aspects by many authors . in particular ,",
    "the rg approach has been applied to intermittency in refs . [ 18,19 ] .",
    "the goal of the present article is to consider a generalization of the pomeau - manneville mechanism for the case of the presence of quasiperiodic driving , and to reveal details of the bifurcation transition , which is an analog of the tangent bifurcation in this case .",
    "it is natural to regard the situation as one of possible scenarios of transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos in the context of the mentioned `` restricted problem '' . at small amplitudes of driving",
    ", the transition is rather trivial and consists in collision with coincidence ( and subsequent disappearance ) of a pair of smooth stable and unstable tori , see e.g. [ 20 , 21 ] .",
    "however , at a definite value of the amplitude a non - trivial critical situation occurs .",
    "it allows application of the rg approach that will be developed .",
    "also , the associated scaling properties will be revealed and discussed .    in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the basic model map and review its dynamical phenomena in the presence of the external quasiperiodic driving . in sec.iii we consider some details of dynamics in terms of rational approximations of the frequency parameter and locate numerically the critical point associated with threshold of fractalization at the moment of collision of the invariant curves . in sec.iv we discuss a link between the problem under study and the harper equation  the lattice version of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation , well known in the context of solid - state physics [ 22 - 27 ] . in sec.v",
    "the rg analysis is developed for the situation of tori fractalization : the rg equation is derived , and results of its numerical solution are presented . in sec.vi",
    "we discuss scaling properties of the dynamics at the critical point . in sec.vii",
    "the linearized rg equation is derived , the spectrum of eigenvalues is obtained , and two relevant eigenvalues responsible for scaling in the parameter plane are distinguished . in sec.viii",
    "we consider consequences of these results concerning dynamics in a neighborhood of the critical point in the parameter space .",
    "in particular , we extract from the rg results the critical exponents for the duration of the laminar stages of intermittency and compare them with empirical numerical data . in conclusion we discuss some perspectives of further studies in the context of the general problem of understanding the transition from usual quasiperiodic regimes ( `` smooth torus '' ) to sna and chaos .",
    "let us start with an example of quasiperiodically forced 1d map    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and frequency parameters of the external force , respectively .",
    "we assume that the frequency parameter , called also the rotation number , is taken to be equal to the inverse golden mean , @xmath7 . as to the function @xmath8 ,",
    "let us define it here as @xmath9 ( one branch of the mapping is selected in a form of the fractional - linear function , @xmath10 , which appears naturally in analysis of dynamics near the tangent bifurcation associated with intermittency , see e.g. [ 18,19 ] .",
    "the other branch is attached somewhat arbitrarily to ensure presence of the re - injection mechanism in the dynamics . )    at zero amplitude of driving what we have is a usual transition to chaos via the pomeau - manneville intermittency of type i , controlled by parameter @xmath11 , see fig.1(a ) . at @xmath12",
    "the map has two fixed points on the left branch , one stable and one unstable . under increase of @xmath11",
    "these points approach one to another , collide , and then disappear .",
    "after that , at @xmath13 , the narrow `` channel '' remains at the place of former existence of the pair of the fixed points , and travel across this channel is a slow process ",
    "the laminar stage of intermittency .",
    "closer to the bifurcation point @xmath14 , larger the number of iterations required to pass the channel . after visiting the right - hand branch ( the turbulent stage of the intermittency ) the orbit quickly returns to the left , and travels through the channel again and again .    if the amplitude of driving is finite ( although sufficiently small ) , then , instead of the fixed points we observe a pair of closed smooth invariant curves , attractor and repeller , see fig.1(b ) .",
    "( a closed invariant curve may be thought as a cross - section of a torus . for brevity , it is convenient sometimes to speak about stable and unstable tori rather than about the invariant curves . ) with increase of @xmath11 attractor and repeller come nearer to each other and collide , and the localized attractor - repeller pair disappears . after that",
    "an extended attractor arises of a form shown in the right panel of fig.1(b ) . on the diagram",
    "a degree of darkness reflects relative duration of presence of the orbit in different parts of the attractor .",
    "while we remain close to the point of bifurcation , the laminar stages of dynamics may be distinguished , which occupy an overwhelming part of observation time , like in the case of the usual pomeau - manneville intermittency . in fig.1(b )",
    "they correspond to a domain of the most long - living residence  along the left branch of the map , at the place of location of the former attractor - repeller pair . in our study",
    "we will concentrate on the analysis of the laminar stages in the same way as it is commonly accepted in the case of conventional intermittency .",
    "for this , it is sufficient to use the map @xmath15    as the numerical simulations clearly demonstrate , the collision of the attractor - repeller pair is of different nature at small and at large amplitudes of driving .",
    "similar observations were reported earlier in computations for the driven circle map [ 21,28 ] .    at @xmath5 less than some critical value @xmath16 ( in our map @xmath17 ) we observe that the invariant curves remain smooth until the collision , and they precisely coincide with one another at that moment ( fig.2(a ) ) .",
    "for @xmath18 they also coincide at the collision , but here the form of the invariant curve appears to be wrinkled ( fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath19 , one can see that the collision takes place only at some fractal subset of points on the invariant curves , and no coincidence of the entire curves is observed ( fig.2(c ) ) .",
    "the essential change in the nature of the transition with passage from @xmath20 to @xmath21 may be demonstrated also by computations of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the lyapunov exponent as it behaves along the bifurcation border ( at the collision of the attractor - repeller pair ) as a function of the amplitude of driving .",
    "observe that for @xmath22 the lyapunov exponent has constant zero value , but for @xmath19 it becomes negative and decreases with growth of @xmath5 according to a visually perfect linear law .",
    "figure 3(b ) depicts a diagram for the lyapunov exponent dependence on @xmath11 at fixed @xmath18 ; it shows essentially distinct behavior , apparently , a power law with a non - trivial exponent .    the intriguing fact that the change of character of the bifurcation in the model map ( [ eq3 ] ) takes place precisely at @xmath23",
    "will be explained in section iv .",
    "as is well known , the irrational @xmath24 taken as the frequency parameter in the driven map is a limit of a sequence of rationals @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the fibonacci numbers ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "let us change the rotational number @xmath6 to its approximant @xmath28 , and introduce a parameter of initial phase @xmath29 into the equation : @xmath30    now , below the transition , at any fixed @xmath29 we have a pair of cycles of period @xmath31 , one stable , and another unstable .",
    "the floquet eigenvalue , or multiplier @xmath32 , which characterizes decrease of a perturbation over one period of the stable cycle , will depend on @xmath29 .",
    "this dependence appears to be periodic , with period @xmath33 . for a given @xmath5 we may select numerically such @xmath11 that the maximal value of @xmath32 at some phase reaches 1 , and @xmath32 is less than 1 at other phases .",
    "it corresponds just to the first tangent bifurcation , that is a collision of the earlier stable cycle of period @xmath31 with its unstable partner .",
    "technically , the computations are simplified with two observations : first , the maximum of the multiplier occurs at @xmath34 , and , second , the initial condition for the cycle at the situation of collision may be expressed explicitly ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) in sec.iv ) .    in table",
    "i we present numerical data for the values of @xmath11 corresponding to the cycle collision at @xmath34 for the critical amplitude @xmath35 .",
    "figure 4 shows the multiplier as a function of the phase @xmath29 in an interval of periodicity in a moment of the first tangent bifurcation .",
    "the diagrams are plotted at three subsequent levels of the rational approximation for the amplitude parameter less , equal , and larger than 2 .",
    "for @xmath36 the dependencies become more flat under increase of the order of the rational approximation ( the bifurcation tends to become `` phase independent '' ) . in contrast , for @xmath37 the curves tend to become sharper . at @xmath38 the form of the curves looks like stabilized at subsequent levels of the rational approximation .",
    "it is interesting to discuss a relation of these observations with the behavior of the lyapunov exponent at the transition .",
    "as we consider attractor for the irrational rotation number in terms of a certain rational approxinmant @xmath25 , it looks like a collection ( continuum set ) of periodic orbits , each of which is associated with a particular initial phase @xmath29 and has a value of lyapunov exponent @xmath39 . to obtain in this approximation an estimate for the lyapunov exponent of the whole attractor",
    ", we have to perform averaging over the initial phases , @xmath40 . from the behavior of the multipliers in the subcritical case",
    "we conclude that the value of @xmath41 will tend to zero under increase of the order of rational approximation . in the supercritical case",
    "only a very pure subset of the orbits will have multipliers distant from 0 and close to 1 , so , the average value of @xmath41 is negative .",
    "these arguments are in agreement with the observed dependence of the lyapunov exponent on the parameter @xmath11 along the bifurcation curve ( see the previous section , fig.3a ) .",
    "as seen from table i , the bifurcation sequence converges to a well - defined limit , @xmath42 ( see also a remark in the final part of sec.vi . ) it is a numerical estimate for the parameter value associated with the critical point of fractalization of the colliding tori .",
    "it will be referred to as the _ tf critical point_. dynamics at this point and in its vicinity is a main subject of our study in sec.v and further .",
    "a schrdinger equation in a normalized form for a quantum particle in a one - dimensional discrete lattice with additional quasiperiodic potential reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spatial index , @xmath5 is an amplitude of the quasiperiodic potential , and @xmath6 defines its wave - number .",
    "alternatively , one can speak of a wave process in a lattice medium with supplied sustained quasiperiodic perturbation . for an oscillatory solution of frequency @xmath45 ( that corresponds to a state of quantum particle of definite energy ) the exponential substitution @xmath46 yields @xmath47 this is the so - called harper equation well - known in the context of solid - state physics [ 22 - 27 ] .",
    "let us return to our fractional - linear map ( [ eq3 ] ) and perform a variable change @xmath48 the result is exactly the harper equation ( [ eq9 ] ) with @xmath45 changed to @xmath11 : @xmath49    the link between the harper equation and the fractional - linear mappings was noticed and exploited earlier by ketoja and satija [ 25 ] , although they were interested in some other problems than that of our concern here .",
    "recently the same idea was effectively used for analysis of spectral properties of the harper equation in ref .",
    "[ 27 ] .    at rational approximants of the wave - number @xmath6 the expression ( [ eq9 ] ) becomes an equation with periodic coefficients .",
    "together with the floquet condition @xmath50 it gives rise to an eigenvalue problem : at any given wave - number @xmath51 one can obtain ( say , numerically [ 24 ] ) a spectrum of frequencies @xmath52 it is called a dispersion equation for the waves in the medium governed by eq.([sch ] ) .",
    "if the equation has a real root @xmath53 at a given @xmath45 , it corresponds to wave propagation , or a transmission band .",
    "if the equation has no real , but complex solutions , we say that @xmath45 is in a forbidden zone , or in a non - transmission band . in this case",
    "no propagating waves , but spatial exponential decay occurs at the given frequency .    to understand relation between nature of solutions of the harper equation and those of our original problem ,",
    "let us turn to a particular case of slow spatial variation of @xmath54 , use the continuous limit , and set @xmath55",
    ". that yields @xmath56 now , at @xmath12 we have solutions of the form @xmath57 , and , according to ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath58 .",
    "it corresponds to presence of two fixed points . at @xmath13",
    "we obtain @xmath59 .",
    "then , @xmath60 as @xmath61 ; it means that no localized attractor is present . in the same manner , a forbidden zone of the harper equation must be associated with existence of a localized attractor - repeller pair of the driven fractional - linear map , while a transmission band corresponds to presence of the `` channel '' and to the laminar stages of intermittency ( see also [ 27 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find that for @xmath55 the transmission band in the harper model occupies an interval of @xmath45 from 0 to 4 . at nonzero",
    "@xmath5 the forbidden zones ( gaps ) arise inside the band , and they become wider as @xmath62 grows . under increase of the order of rational approximation @xmath63 , new and new narrower gaps appear inside the transmission bands .",
    "it occurs that for @xmath36 in the limit @xmath64 the transmission bands of higher orders dominate over the forbidden zones ( i.e. they have a larger total width ) , but for @xmath37 the situation is opposite [ 23,24 ] .",
    "the transition from one type of behavior to another is known as the localization - delocalization transition .",
    "the structure of the transmission bands at the transition appears to be a kind of cantor - like set .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the transmission and forbidden zones colored , respectively , by gray and white on the parameter plane @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that the transition in the harper equation must take place at @xmath66 follows from the argument of aubry [ 29,24 ] . by means of the fourier - like transformation @xmath67 one obtains from ( [ eq9 ] ) an equation of similar form @xmath68 but with parameters",
    "@xmath69 localization of a wave - function implies delocalization of its transform , and vise versa .",
    "so , the transition has to occur at @xmath35 that corresponds to a fixed point of the equation for @xmath5 .    in fig.5(a )",
    "one can find a forbidden zone in the bottom part of the diagram .",
    "obviously , its top border must correspond to the threshold of intermittency in the fractional - linear map . as may be observed from comparison of fig.5(a ) and",
    "( b ) , this is indeed the case .",
    "the tf critical point found in the previous section corresponds exactly to the lowest frequency associated with appearance of the wave propagation at the localization  delocalization transition in the harper eguation ( at @xmath38 ) .",
    "the harper equation ( [ eq8 ] ) possesses an evident symmetry being invariant in respect to the spatial reflection @xmath70 .",
    "hence , it is possible to construct a symmetric solution . for this",
    "we have to set @xmath71 \\psi _ 0 $ ] .",
    "according to ( [ eq6 ] ) , the respective orbit of the fractional - linear map ( [ eq3 ] ) has an initial condition @xmath72 if this orbit is localized ( that occurs at one special value of @xmath11 for each @xmath5 ) , it will correspond to the situation of the attractor - repeller collision .",
    "as well , this is true for periodic orbits corresponding to rational approximants @xmath28 at @xmath34 ( see eq.([eq4 ] ) ) , and this notion is technically useful for computation of the sequence of parameter @xmath11 values converging to the critical point tf ( sec.iii ) .",
    "let us develop now the rg approach to the dynamics at the critical point tf . here",
    "we prefer to write out the original model in a form of two - dimensional mapping    @xmath73    and assume , for convenience , that the phase variable @xmath29 is defined in such way that it always belongs to the interval @xmath74 .    as the frequency parameter is the inverse golden mean , it is natural to deal with the evolution operators corresponding to fibonacci s numbers of iterations .",
    "we need to introduce here a new variable @xmath75 ( it differs from @xmath76 by a @xmath29-dependent shift , but details will be explained below ) .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the functions representing transformation of @xmath75 after @xmath31 and @xmath79 iterations , respectively . to construct the next operator , for @xmath80 steps , we start from @xmath81 and perform first @xmath79 iteration to arrive at ( @xmath82 ) , and then the rest @xmath26 iterations with the result @xmath83    to have a reasonable limit behavior of the sequence of the evolution operators we change scales for @xmath75 and @xmath29 by some appropriate factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 at each new step of the construction , and define the renormalized functions as @xmath86 note that @xmath87 , so it is natural to set @xmath88 . rewriting ( [ eq17 ] ) in terms of the renormalized functions we come to the functional equation @xmath89    the same equation was obtained in the rg analysis of the critical points tdt and tct [ 15,16 ] . here",
    "we will deal with some other solution of that equation , associated with the ft critical point . to find out of what kind this solution is , we may attempt to compute the functions @xmath90 from direct iterations of the map ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , the variable @xmath76 in the original map must be distinguished from @xmath75 used in the derivation of the rg equation .",
    "in other words , we have to produce a variable change to pass to an appropriate scaling coordinate system in the two - dimensional phase space @xmath91 .",
    "the new coordinates may be defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is obtained from eq.([eq15 ] ) with substitution @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are some coefficients .    to evaluate the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 we can act as follows .",

    "its portrait is shown in fig.8 in natural variables @xmath141 . depicting a part of the plot in scaling coordinates @xmath142",
    "we reveal a scaling property intrinsic to the attractor : the structure is reproduced again and again at each subsequent step of magnification by factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 along the vertical and horizontal axes , respectively .",
    "this scaling property follows directly from the fact that in scaling coordinates the evolution operators for different fibonacci numbers of iterations are asymptotically the same , up to the scale change ( recall fig.6 ) .    from the scaling property",

    "the form reproduces itself under simultaneous scale change by factors @xmath84 and @xmath88 along the axes @xmath75 and @xmath108 , respectively , so , it must behave locally as @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "as follows , this is a smooth curve , twice differentiable at the origin , but the third derivative diverges . due to ergodicity ensured by irrationality of the frequency ,",
    "the weak singularity at the origin implies existence of the same type of singularities over the whole invariant curve , on a dense set of points .",
    "apparently , the observed wrinkled form of the invariant curve at the critical point ( see figs.2 and 8) reflects a presence of the mentioned set of dense weak singularities .",

    ". these spectra may be useful for a comparison with possible experimental studies of the transition . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. far enough from the critical value , the spectrum contains a few components .",

    "the spectrum has a self - similar structure .",
    "it can be revealed by the use of the double logarithmic scale ( as suggested in a different context in refs.[10 - 12 ] ) , see fig.10 .",
    "a shift of parameters in the map ( [ eq16 ] ) from the critical point corresponds to some perturbation of the evolution operator , and this perturbation will evolve under subsequent application of the rg transformation ( [ eq19 ] ) . let us assume that the perturbation retains our evolution operators in the class of fractional - linear mappings .",
    "it means that we can search for solution of eq.([eq19 ] ) in a form @xmath145 where @xmath123 correspond to the fixed - point solution , while the terms with tilde are responsible for the perturbation .",

    "numerically , we solved the problem by use of finite polynomial approximations for the functions involved , with taking into account the previously found fixed - point solution .",

    "is rescaled as @xmath154 , and , respectively , the renormalized relative coordinate shift is multiplied by @xmath84 too .",
    "so , @xmath155 represents an eigenvector , and @xmath84 is the associated eigenvalue .",
    "( one can verify it by a direct substitution of the eigenvector into eq.([eq27 ] ) ; moreover , the assertion has been checked also by accurate comparison of the present eigenvector components with those found numerically as functions of @xmath29 . )",
    "so , we may exclude the eigenvalue @xmath84 from the list , because a perturbation of this kind in the evolution operator may be always compensated by a shift of the origin . in the same way",
    ", we regard several other eigenvectors as irrelevant , they are marked in table iii as linked with variable changes .",
    "second , in the derivation of the rg equation we have used a definite order for the efolution operators ( first @xmath156 , then @xmath26 steps ) . however , this order may be inverted , and it leads to a distinct alternative formulation of the eigenvalue problem , namely , @xmath157    the true evolution operators are in any case the multiple compositions of the same original map .",
    "thus , for the actual perturbations the equations ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) must be equivalent . in other words , only those eigenvectors may be of relevance , which are common for both the eigenvalue problems .",
    "this property was verified numerically for all found eigenvectors .",
    "as observed , some of them do not satisfy the condition ; in table iii they are marked as relating to a non - commutative subspace .",
    "the rest two eigenvalues @xmath158 are relevant and responsible for scaling properties of the parameter space near the critical point tf .",
    "if we depart from the critical point in the parameter plane along the bifurcation curve of the attractor - repeller collision , the first eigenvector appears not to contribute into the perturbation of the evolution operator . in this case",
    "the only relevant perturbation is associated with @xmath159 .",
    "however , if we choose a transversal direction , say , along the axis @xmath11 , the perturbation of the first kind appears .",
    "it means that a coordinate system appropriate for observation of scaling in the parameter plane has to be defined as shown in fig.11 .",
    "it is a curvilinear system : one coordinate axis is the line @xmath35 , but another follows the bifurcation border accounting its curvature . in analytical expression",
    "it is sufficient to keep terms up to the second order .",
    "( this is due to the concrete relation between @xmath160 and @xmath161 : @xmath162 and @xmath163 , but @xmath164 ; see other examples of scaling coordinates for different critical points and discussion of the role of the relation of the eigenvalues in refs [ 13,16,30,31 ] . )",
    "so , we set @xmath165 where @xmath166    the expression for @xmath167 follows from the analogy with the harper equation and from the aubry transformation rule ( [ eq13 ] ) : an infinitesimal shift of @xmath5 and @xmath11 along the tangent line to the bifurcation border must correspond to the shift of @xmath168 and @xmath169 along the same line .",
    "the value of @xmath170 is calculated numerically , from the curvature of the bifurcation border .",
    "beside the obtained nontrivial solution of the rg equation there exists also a trivial , phase independent fixed point @xmath171 with @xmath172 naturally , this is the fixed point responsible for behavior on the subcritical part of the bifurcation border and associated with the transition accompanied by a collision of smooth invariant curves .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the linearized rg equation may be solved analytically for this case , and it reveals a unique relevant eigenvalue @xmath173",
    "let us discuss now a question on the peculiarities of intermittency in the quasiperiodically forced map .",
    "first of all , we outline a possibility of three distinct regimes at the onset of intermittency :    * subcritical , @xmath174 , when collision with coincidence of the smooth invariant curves ( attractor and repeller ) takes place at the moment of bifurcation ; * critical , @xmath175 , it corresponds to collision and coincidence of the wrinkled invariant curves ( the threshold of fractalization ) ; * supercritical , @xmath21 , there collision of the invariant curves occurs at some fractal subset of points .",
    "figure 12 ( a)-(c ) show the time dependencies for dynamical variable generated by the model map ( [ eq1 ] ) just before and after the transition for the mentioned three cases . in the intermittent regimes the laminar stages are interrupted by the turbulent bursts. the laminar stages on the right panels reproduce approximately the patterns of the left panels",
    ".    relative duration of the laminar phases becomes larger as we approach the transition point . in usual pomeau - manneville intermittency of type",
    "i the average duration of the laminar stages behaves as @xmath176 with @xmath177 [ 17 - 19 ] .    in presence of the quasiperiodic force",
    "the same law is valid in the subcritical region @xmath36 . in the critical case",
    "@xmath35 the exponent is distinct .",
    "indeed , as follows from the rg results , to observe increase of a characteristic time scale by factor @xmath178 we have to decrease a shift of parameter @xmath11 from the bifurcation threshold by factor @xmath179 .",
    "as follows , the exponent must be @xmath180 ( note that substitution of @xmath181 factor associated with the trivial fixed point ( [ eq33 ] ) yields just the result for the subcritical region , @xmath177 . )",
    "figure 13 shows the data of numerical experiments with the fractional - linear map aimed to verify the theoretical predictions for the exponent @xmath182 . at each fixed @xmath5",
    "we empirically determined an average duration of passage through the channel in dependence on @xmath183 for ensemble of orbits with random initial conditions and plotted the results in the double logarithmic scale .",
    "for particular @xmath184 ( subcritical ) and 2 ( critical ) the dependencies fit the straight lines of a definite slope .",
    "as seen from table iv , the correspondence of numerical results with the theoretical predictions is rather good . at subcritical @xmath5 slightly less than 2",
    "one can observe a crossover phenomenon , that is the slope change from critical to subcritical value at some intermediate value of @xmath183 .",
    "it is interesting that the results obtained for the supercritical region also indicate a constant definite slope , @xmath185 . at this moment",
    "it is not clear how to explain this observation theoretically .",
    "figure 14 shows diagrams for lyapunov exponents versus parameter @xmath11 for subcritical , critical , and supercritical constant values of @xmath5 in the artificial map ( [ eq1 ] ) , which includes the reinjection mechanism .    for the subcritical case the intermittency threshold corresponds to the onset of chaos : the lyapunov exponent becomes positive immediately after the transition .    in the supercritical region",
    "the lyapunov exponent is yet negative at the moment of the bifurcation , it can not immediately become positive , and the transition will be accompanied by a birth of an sna rather than a chaotic attractor .    in the critical situation",
    "the diagram demonstrates self - similarity ( at least , in the domain @xmath186 ) : a magnification by factor @xmath187 along the horisontal axis , and by factor @xmath188 ( the rescaling factor for time ) along the vertical axis gives rise to similar pictures .",
    "figure 15 demonstrates a chart of parameter plane , or the phase diagram in the natural variables ( left panel ) and in the scaling coordinates ( the right panel ) .",
    "the gray areas are those of negative lyapunov exponent , two distinct tones correspond to the domains of existence of the localized attractors ( smooth tori in the bottom area ) and to the intermittent regimes ( the top area to the right ) .",
    "apparently , the last is the region of sna .",
    "this assertion may be deduced from arguments of pikovsky and feudel [ 6 ] . indeed , considering dynamics there in terms of rational approximants",
    "one can notice that the phase - dependent bifurcations will occur inevitably .",
    "in contrast , the white area of positive lyapunov exponent is the domain of chaotic intermittent regimes .",
    "figure 16 shows portraits of attractors at several representative points of the phase diagram .",
    "the present study was devoted to one special situation of transition from conventional quasiperiodicity ( smooth torus ) to chaos or sna via intermittency in a model map under quasiperiodic external driving with frequency parameter defined as the inverse golden mean .",
    "the main attention was concentrated on a critical situation reached at one particular , sufficiently large amplitude of driving , associated with threshold of fractalization . here",
    "the bifurcation transition analogous to the tangent bifurcation consists in collision with coincidence and subsequent disappearance of an attractor and a repeller represented by a pair of wrinkled invariant curves .",
    "rg analysis appropriate for the critical situation was developed , the fixed - point solution of the rg equation was found in a class of fractional - linear functions , the constants responsible for scaling in phase space and parameter space were computed .",
    "some related problems remain yet open , for example , concerning global scaling properties and dimensions of the critical attractor .",
    "also a generalization for other irrational rotational numbers is of interest .",
    "( the last seems undoubtedly possible because of the analogy with harper equation : there the criticality at @xmath35 occurs at arbitrary values of the rotational number . )",
    "one more problem is a developement of an appropriate approach to analysis of the transition in supercritical region , which would be of the same significance , as the rg method is in the critical and subcritical cases .    as is common in situations allowing the rg analysis",
    ", one can expect that the quantitative regularities intrinsic to our model map will be valid also in other systems relating to the same universality class .",
    "in particular , it may be suggested that transition to sna observed in a quasiperiodically forced subcritical circle map [ 28 ] is of the same nature . also , it would be significant to find this type of behavior in systems of higher dimension , for example , in quasiperiodically driven invertible 2d maps , which could represent poincare maps of some flow systems .",
    "it would be interesting to reveal details and regularities of coexistence and subordination of the discussed type of critical behavior with behaviors of distinct universality classes studied in refs .",
