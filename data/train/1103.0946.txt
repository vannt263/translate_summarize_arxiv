    "molecular para - hydrogen has been suggested from long time ago as the possible second natural superfluid after liquid @xmath3he .",

    "the advantage of having half the mass of @xmath3he is therefore not enough to compensate the hydrogen strong attraction and para - h@xmath0 becomes solid at temperature @xmath4 k. many attempts to supercool liquid hydrogen down to the expected lambda transition ( @xmath5 k ) have been unfruitful , at least for the bulk phase.@xcite partial success has only been achieved in confined geometries , mainly in small pure liquid drops  @xcite or bigger drops in a @xmath3he environment .",

    "@xcite the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite show evidence of superfluidity mostly localized in the surface of the cluster , pointing to an inhomogeneous structure with an inner solid core surrounded by a liquid _ skin _ that , at the lowest temperatures , is superfluid .",
    "this localized superfluidity has been questioned in a recent pimc calculation where it has been shown that superfluidity is a global property of the cluster in spite of its significant spatial structure .",
    "@xcite in the limit of zero temperature , the structure and energy of small h@xmath0 clusters have been accurately studied using both diffusion monte carlo ( dmc )  @xcite and path integral ground state ( pigs ) .",
    "@xcite both at finite and zero temperature the simulations show the presence of _",
    "magic_-cluster sizes in which the chemical potential shows a kink .",
    "these more stable @xmath10 configurations have also been observed experimentally in cryogenic free jet expansions using raman spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we address the question of the solidification of para - h@xmath0 clusters in the limit of zero temperature and as a function of the number of molecules .",
    "our aim is the screening of the more stable ground - state structure by performing simulations where the phase ( liquid or solid ) is kept fixed . to this end",
    ", we use the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method that solves stochastically the @xmath10-body schrdinger equation exactly for bosons , within some statistical errors . differently from previous studies using dmc ,",
    "we have focused our attention on the discrimination between liquid and solid phases as a function of the number of molecules .",
    "this goal is achieved by carrying out parallel simulations for liquid and solid configurations at each @xmath10 , with special effort on the search for optimal lattices on which to build trial wave functions for the solid clusters . with the present study ,",
    "we show which is the energetically preferred phase at @xmath11 for each @xmath10 , in the range @xmath12 , and how the energy difference between the two type of clusters changes with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present our theoretical approach that relies on the dmc method . in sec .",
    "iii , we report our results on the energetic and structure properties of the para - h@xmath0 clusters in the @xmath10 range analyzed .",
    "finally , we end with the summary and main conclusions in sec .",
    "our study of para - h@xmath0 clusters relies on a purely microscopic approach whose inputs are only the interparticle interaction and the mass . our goal is the study of these finite systems at zero temperature to deal with their ground state . to this end",
    ", we use the dmc method which is able to generate exact ( within statistical uncertainty ) information through guided random walks . the starting point in the dmc method",
    "is the @xmath10-body schrdinger equation , written in imaginary time @xmath13 with @xmath14 , a @xmath15-dimensional vector ( _ walker _ ) , and @xmath16 the imaginary time measured in units of @xmath17 .",
    "the time - dependent wave function of the system @xmath18 can be expanded in terms of a complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath19 of the hamiltonian , @xmath20\\ , \\phi_i({\\bf r})\\ , \\label{dmc.eq1b}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the eigenvalue associated to @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the asymptotic solution of [ dmc.eq1 ] , for any value @xmath22 close to the energy of the ground state and for long times ( @xmath23 ) , gives @xmath24 , provided that there is a nonzero overlap between @xmath25 and the ground - state wave function @xmath24 .",
    "a direct monte carlo implementation of [ dmc.eq1 ] is hardly able to work efficiently , especially when the interatomic potential contains a hard core .",
    "this is solved by using importance sampling .",
    "the importance sampling technique is a general concept in monte carlo and is one of the best methods to reduce the variance of any mc calculation .",
    "the importance sampling method , applied to [ dmc.eq1 ] , consists in rewriting the schrdinger equation in terms of the wave function @xmath26 @xmath27 being a time - independent variational wave function that describes approximately the ground state of the system . considering a hamiltonian of the form",
    "@xmath28 [ dmc.eq1 ] turns out to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the local energy , and @xmath32 is called drift or quantum force . @xmath33 acts as an external force which guides the diffusion process , involved by the first term in [ dmc.eq4 ] , to regions where @xmath27 is large .    the r.h.s . of [ dmc.eq4 ] may be written as the action of three operators @xmath34 acting on the wave function @xmath35 , @xmath36 the three terms @xmath34 may be interpreted by similarity with classical differential equations .",
    "the first one , @xmath37 , corresponds to a free diffusion with a a diffusion coefficient @xmath38 ; @xmath39 acts as a driving force due to an external potential , and finally @xmath40 looks like a birth / death term . in monte carlo ,",
    "the schrdinger equation [ dmc.eq4p ] is best suited when it is written in an integral form by introducing the green function @xmath41 , which gives the transition probability from an initial state @xmath42 to a final one @xmath43 during a time @xmath16 , @xmath44 more explicitly , the green function is given in terms of the operator @xmath45 by @xmath46    dmc algorithms rely on reasonable approximations of @xmath47 for small values of the time - step @xmath48 .",
    "we work with a second - order expansion of the exponential [ [ dmc.eq7 ] ] to reduce the time - step dependence .",
    "@xcite once a short - time approximation is assumed , [ dmc.eq7 ] is iterated repeatedly until reaching the asymptotic regime @xmath49 , a limit in which one is effectively sampling the ground state .",
    "para - h@xmath0 is a boson particle with total spin 0 and with rotational ground - state state @xmath50 .",
    "it is well described by a merely radial interaction due to its high - degree sphericity . among the different interatomic potentials proposed for describing the h@xmath0-h@xmath0 intermolecular interaction , we have chosen the silvera - goldman potential  @xcite due to its proved accuracy and its dominant use in microscopic calculations as the present one .",
    "the well depth of the molecular hydrogen interaction is @xmath51 k , a factor of four larger than in helium , making the ground - state phase of bulk at zero temperature be an hcp crystal in spite of h@xmath0 mass being half the @xmath3he one .",
    "the trial wave function used for importance sampling is written as the product of one- and two - body correlation factors , @xmath52 with @xmath53 the two - body term @xmath54 accounts for the correlations induced by the potential @xmath55 and also for the finite size of the system that implies the wave function approaches zero when the distance is of the order of the cluster size .",
    "the one - body term @xmath56 is only used for solid clusters and localizes particles around the preferred sites ( capital indexes in [ eq.jastrow ] ) . this model wave function for the solid , with the one - body gaussian terms , is the well - know nosanow - jastrow ( nj ) wave function that has been widely used in the study of bulk quantum solids .",
    "the nj wave function is not symmetric under the exchange of particles but the influence in the energy of symmetrization is known to be of the order of milikelvin  @xcite and therefore indistinguishable within our statistical errors .",
    "recently , it has been proposed a symmetrized nj wave function to study superfluidity in bulk solid @xmath3he and proved that the change in energy due to bose symmetry on top of the nj model is imperceptible , within the numerical resolution of quantum monte carlo .",
    "@xcite it is worth noticing that the effect of symmetrization in the structure of para - h@xmath0 clusters at temperature @xmath57 k has been recently studied by warnecke _",
    ";  @xcite the results obtained show a very small influence of bose statistics on the density profiles , the energy differences being not reported .",
    "the parameters entering in eq .",
    "( 11 ) and eq .",
    "( 12 ) have been optimized using the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method . for liquid configurations",
    "the optimal parameters are : @xmath58  , @xmath59 @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ; for solid ones : @xmath62  , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "these are the vmc optimal parameters for @xmath66 but the dependence of these parameters with @xmath10 is tiny : for @xmath2 , @xmath67 @xmath60 , @xmath68 @xmath65 , and @xmath69 is the same . in dmc",
    "we have neglected this slight @xmath10 dependence because the results are insensitive to it .",
    "on the other hand , two technical issues related to the implementation of the dmc method , i.e. , the time - step dependence and the number of walkers , have been accurately analyzed to reduce any systematic bias to the level of the statistical noise .",
    "the simulation of solid clusters with the nj wave function we are using requires of a set of lattice points . in the case of bulk solids , the number of possible lattices is few , well known and easy to characterize geometrically .",
    "when dealing with finite systems , the issue of the best geometrical arrangement is somehow universal for the smallest structures , where mackay polyhedra are the preferred structures , but it becomes more complex when the number of particle increases .",
    "moreover , the determination of the optimal solid patterns are normally obtained using classical physics and the influence on those of quantum delocalization is less known .",
    "our strategy for this optimization has been the use of both simulated annealing ( sa ) and ab initio random search ( method for finding structures where the total classical force felt by any particle is approximately zero ) .",
    "the structures of minimum energy predicted for both approaches essentially coincide for @xmath70 , but for larger @xmath10 values the sa method has proven to be better . in the sa approach ,",
    "we have used both an exponential annealing schedule and another with constant thermodynamic speed .",
    "@xcite the search for any @xmath10 has been carried out by starting from 2040 random configurations and selecting the best ones for a posterior quantum simulation . in some cases ,",
    "we have performed additional optimizations using long classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , we used the best classical solutions as initial setup for the quantum simulations and reported in all cases the lowest energy achieved .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we introduced a scaling factor @xmath71 in the quantum simulation , @xmath72 with @xmath73 the center of mass of the cluster and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) the sa points , to allow for possible spatial expansions or contractions of the classic lattice points but the optimal energy was always the corresponding to the classic solutions ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we have calculated the energy and structure properties of h@xmath0 clusters in the range @xmath12 using the dmc method discussed in the preceding section . at each @xmath10 , we have used both the liquid and solid trial wave functions introduced in sec .",
    "ii . in [ fig:1 ] , we show the results for the energy per particle obtained for both phases and for clusters up to @xmath1 molecules .",
    "the difference between both configurations is small in all the @xmath10 range studied pointing to a highly correlated liquid , even for the lightest clusters .",
    "the energy per particle in absolute value increases with @xmath10 for both phases but solid clusters have energies with a kind of zigzag dependence whereas the liquid ones follow a smoother law .",
    "the irregular behavior of the energy of solid clusters is consequence of the appearance of magic numbers , with geometrically more compact structures that make them more stable .",
    "clusters as a function of @xmath10 . circles and diamonds",

    "the lines are guides to the eye .",
    "error bars are smaller than the size of the symbols , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the difference between the energies of liquid and solid clusters is shown explicitly in [ fig:2 ] .",
    "starting from @xmath2 , the energy of liquid clusters is clearly preferred but the difference @xmath77 decreases when @xmath10 increases . according to our results , the first cluster that is solid in its ground state is the one with @xmath78 . from @xmath79 to 40 , there are some solid clusters but for @xmath80 and the following ones there is again a liquid regime . arriving to @xmath1 ,",
    "one enters definitively in a preferred solid phase that persists up to @xmath81 which is the largest cluster here analyzed .",
    "the more intriguing aspect of our results is the existence of a liquid stability _ island _ for @xmath8050 between the initial solid regime and the second one , that we think is the stable one for @xmath82 .",
    "it can be argued that the nonuniform crystallization of h@xmath0 clusters that we have observed can be due to our model of solid clusters .",
