    "1965 is an important year in the history of general relativity ( gr ) , which underwent a very important revival period during the entire 1960 decade .",
    "the discovery and interpretation of the cosmic background radiation @xcite and the first modern singularity theorem @xcite were published in 1965 though both findings happened in 1964 a year not only right in the middle of that decade , but also exactly 50 years after the birth of einstein s field equations",
    "r _ - r g _ + g _",
    "= t _ [ efe ] hence half way to the present centenary . ) of the field equations only came about one year later when the cosmological constant @xmath0 was introduced in @xcite . ] in this article we review the history , impact and legacy of the penrose singularity theorem , one of our selected  milestones of general relativity \" , which was a key contribution to the renaissance of the theory .",
    "the acclaimed singularity theorems are often quoted as one of the greatest theoretical accomplishments in general relativity , lorentzian geometry and mathematical physics .",
    "even though there were several results proving singularities prior to @xcite and these will be discussed in sections [ sec : prehistory ] and [ sec : history]",
    "penrose s theorem is , without a doubt , the first such theorem in its modern form containing new important ingredients and fruitful ideas that immediately led to many new developments in theoretical relativity , and to devastating physical consequences concerning the origin of the universe and the collapse of massive stars , see sections [ sec : impact ] and [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "in particular , penrose introduced geodesic incompleteness to characterize singularities ( see subsection [ subsec : singularities ] ) , used the notion of a cauchy hypersurface ( and thereby of global hyperbolicity , see section [ sec : theorem ] ) and , more importantly , he presented the gravitational community with a precious gift in the form of a novel concept : closed trapped surfaces , see subsections [ subsec : trapped ] and [ subsec : trapped2 ] .",
    "the fundamental , germinal and very fruitful notion of closed trapped surface is a key central idea in the physics of black holes , numerical relativity , mathematical relativity , cosmology and gravity analogues .",
    "it has had an enormous influence as explained succinctly in section [ sec : impact ] and , in its refined contemporary versions see subsections [ subsec : trapped2 ] and [ subsec : ineq] , keeps generating many more advances ( sections [ sec : legacy ] and [ sec : xxi ] ) of paramount importance and will probably maintain such prolific legacy with some unexpected applications in gravitational physics .    as argued elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the singularity theorems constitute the first genuine post - einstenian content of classical gr , not foreseen in any way by einstein as opposed to many other ",
    "milestones \" discussed in this issue .",
    "the global mathematical developments needed for the singularity theorems , and the ideas on incompleteness or trapping and thus also their derived inferences  were not treated nor mentioned , neither directly nor indirectly , in any of einstein s writings . in 1965",
    "gr left adolescence behind , emancipated from its creator , and became a mature physical theory full of vitality and surprises .",
    "prior to 1965 there were many indications that the appearance of some kind of catastrophic irregularities , say  singularities \" , was common in gr .",
    "we give a succinct summary of some selected and instructive cases , with side historical remarks .      as an early example , in 1922 friedman @xcite looked for solutions of ( [ efe ] ) with the form ds^2 = -f dt^2 + a^2(t)(d^2+^2 d^2 ) [ fri ] where @xmath1 is a function of time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is an arbitrary function , and @xmath4 represents the standard metric for a round sphere of unit radius .",
    "this ansatz followed previous discussions by einstein and de sitter @xcite where the space ( for each @xmath5const . )",
    "was taken to be a round 3-sphere ( so that @xmath6 ) and the energy - momentum described pressure - less matter ( ` dust ' ) with @xmath7 as the unique non - identically vanishing component .",
    "friedman proved that the only possible solutions to ( [ efe ] ) with constant @xmath1 were given by either @xmath8const .",
    ", which gives the einstein static universe of @xcite , or by @xmath9 which leads to the de sitter universe @xcite ( in this case with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "_ nevertheless _ , he also found that there are dynamical solutions that require @xmath12 and a scale factor @xmath1 satisfying the following set of odes @xmath13 where dots indicate derivative with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the second equation has an immediate first integral @xmath15 for a constant @xmath16 , and then the first equation provides the explicit form of the mass density @xmath17 a simple analysis of the solutions for @xmath1 leads to the conclusion that , whenever @xmath18 , @xmath19 inevitably for a finite value of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a terrible failure of space - time itself , as the spatial part in ( [ fri ] ) truly _ vanishes _ and the mass density diverges .",
    "friedman talked about the  creation time \" , and then went on to consider the case with negatively curved space slices @xmath5const .  in @xcite",
    "incidentally , and for the sake of illustration in later discussions , one may observe that the creation time is absent when @xmath20 , in which case the energy density vanishes .",
    "this provides another solution of ( [ efe ] ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is easily checked that this new solution describes a space - time of positive constant curvature , ergo maximally symmetric @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the original de sitter solution with @xmath9 has also positive constant curvature , and therefore the two of them must be isometric .",
    "however , there arises a problem in the line - element ( [ fri ] ) with @xmath9 at @xmath23 in this case it is time that seems to vanish so that in principle only one of the two intervals @xmath24 or @xmath25 should be allowed for @xmath26 .",
    "this amounts to taking only one hemi-3-sphere , and it becomes apparent that the manifold has been mutilated artificially .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite and independently in @xcite , where one can find pioneer analyses of the observational redshift in cosmological models . with modern notation ,",
    "the question is resolved by noticing that the first solution with a constant @xmath27 can be obtained from the second one ( written with barred coordinates ) by means of the following transformation @xmath28 , \\hspace{1 cm } \\sin\\chi=\\cosh ( c\\bar t/\\lambda)\\sin\\bar\\chi \\ , .\\ ] ] note that , in this transformation , the barred coordinates are restricted by @xmath29 , a restriction which is not necessary in the solution by itself .",
    "thus , the second solution provides effectively an _ extension _ of the original de sitter solution .",
    "it is important to realize that , while the original de sitter solution is independent of time @xmath2 ( and therefore it is static ) , the extended solution depends explicitly on time @xmath30 and it is not _ globally _ static .",
    "one way to see the effect of this property , which is enlightening for later considerations , is to check that the area of the round spheres defined by constant values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "one may be tempted to use this expression as a new coordinate by calling it ` @xmath33 ' say , but : will @xmath34 be a space , or rather a time , coordinate ? to answer this question one computes the gradient of the function @xmath34 and checks its causal character .",
    "it is easily seen that this gradient is spacelike in the region @xmath29 ( the original de sitter one ) , while it is timelike when @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in this last region , _ the area of the round spheres is strictly increasing ( or decreasing ) towards the future , as @xmath34 is a time coordinate_.    we had to wait until penrose found a deeper significance and a discerning interpretation of this kind of behavior in his milestone paper @xcite .      in 1927",
    "lematre @xcite constructed a model that combined einstein static and de sitter universes in the sense that it approached the former at large past times and the latter in future distant times . in this way he provided an explanation for the observed galactic ( or nebulosae ) redshift based on gr .",
    "then , in an outstanding and insightful paper @xcite , he constructed a general solution of the field equations ( [ efe ] ) for dust and spherical symmetry ( today known as the lematre - tolman model @xcite ) and found many interesting results including the instability of einstein static universe , in particular , an ubiquitous initial singularity of friedman creation - time type for expanding models capable of explaining the observed cosmological redshifts .",
    "thus , the singularity was there again .",
    "of course , this singular behaviour could be due to an excess of symmetry ( spherical ) which , as exact , would not be realistic .",
    "very remarkably he _ gave up spherical symmetry _ and studied the spatially homogeneous but anisotropic models that today we call bianchi i models @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was unambiguous : the singularity is still there ,  anisotropy can no more prevent the vanishing of space \" @xcite .",
    "in the very same excellent paper @xcite , lematre proved , and unequivocally understood , the non - singular nature of the schwarzschild event horizon along the same lines of what had happened with de sitter space - time and its extensions .",
    "he managed to write the general solution of the spherically symmetric vacuum field equations ( [ efe ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 $ ] , with @xmath38 a constant and @xmath39 as above .",
    "as one can see , this solution is singular only at @xmath40 ( for positive @xmath38 and non - negative @xmath0 ) , thus removing the then called  schwarzschild singularity \" .",
    "he then found an explicit change of coordinates bringing the previous line - element into the standard kottler form @xcite ds^2 = -(1 - - r^2)c^2 dt^2 + ( 1 - - r^2)^-1dr^2 + r^2 d^2 .",
    "[ kot ] recall that schwarzschild had found the general solution of einstein vacuum equations without @xmath0 in @xcite , which can be written in standard coordinates as ( [ kot ] ) with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "there appeared a distinguished worrying hypersurface @xmath42 , which is actually similar to the region @xmath23 in de sitter space - time analyzed above .",
    "therefore , the metric found by lematre is an explicit regular extension of the schwarzschild solution that includes regions beyond @xmath42 . in @xcite",
    "he distinctly remarked that the `` problem '' was due to the assumption of the entire spherically symmetric world being static :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we show that the [ @xmath43 singularity of the schwarzschild exterior is an apparent singularity due to the fact that one has imposed a static solution and that it can be eliminated by a change of coordinates .",

    "all extensions require giving up staticity if regions with @xmath46 are to be included , where @xmath33 is the area of the preferred round spheres .",
    "these extensions show that there is something unusual going on with the round spheres in the @xmath46-regions because their area function @xmath33 can be seen as a _",
    "coordinate there , as mentioned above in the de sitter case .",
    "it is interesting to notice that lematre wanted to solve an apparent contradiction between the spherically symmetric friedman s solutions , where the area of the round spheres can become as small as desired , and the existence of a minimum value for such an area if one is to accept the @xmath47 restriction of the static schwarzschild solution because then `` a mass such as that of the universe [ could ] not have a radius less than one billion light years '' ( @xcite , p.643 of the english translation ) .",
    "there is a discussion in @xcite putting forward the view that this line of reasoning was seminal to the later oppenheimer - snyder models , next subsection [ subsec : os ] .",
    "the previous discussion indicates that singularities in the past of our world appeared in the simplest models of the classical gr theory if the universe is expanding everywhere .",
    "one could consider a sort of time - reversal of this situation : what happens in contracting worlds ?",
    "this turned out to be of enormous relevance for the study of compact stars , since in 1931 chandrasekhar unexpectedly found an upper mass limit for white dwarf stars in equilibrium , even when taking into account the quantum effects @xcite .",
    "this implied that stars with a larger mass will inevitably collapse .",
    "then , the question of massive neutron cores ( or stars ) was addressed in @xcite by using a cold fermi gas equation of state and gr .",
    "they found another mass limit for equilibrium and concluded that , even allowing for deviations from the fermi equation of state , a massive enough neutron star will contract indefinitely never reaching equilibrium again .",
    "this prompted oppenheimer and snyder to consider the solutions of the field equations ( [ efe ] ) that described such physical processes @xcite .",
    "they proved using general arguments that , in spherical symmetry , values of @xmath42 would eventually be reached , that light emitted from the star would be more and more redshifted for external observers who would only see the star approach @xmath48 asymptotically , and that the entire process will last a finite amount of time for observers comoving with the stellar matter .",
    "they then constructed an explicit analytical model which , in modern language , consists of a portion of the friedman closed model ( [ fri ] ) for dust ( with @xmath41 and @xmath49 ) matched with the schwarzschild solution at the timelike hypersurface defined by @xmath50 on the interior side and correspondingly by a hypersurface ruled by timelike geodesics and @xmath51 on the vacuum side proving that the junction requires @xmath52 hence , ( i ) the  schwarzschild surface \" @xmath42 was indeed crossable by innocuous models containing realistic matter such as dust ; and ( ii ) a careful analysis of the model shows that the star will end up in a catastrophic singularity where @xmath53 and therefore space  vanishes \" again .",
    "what did einstein think about the singularities and all the previous results ?",
    "well , it is hard to tell , obviously , but it seems that he and the orthodoxy simply dismissed the known singularities as either a mathematical artifact due to the spherical symmetry , or as unattainable effects beyond the feasibility of the physical world . in the same 1939 einstein ,",
    "seemingly unaware of @xcite ,  proved \" that the schwarzschild singularity is not physically realizable @xcite by considering a statistical distribution of particles moving in circular orbits due to its own ( spherically symmetric ) gravitational field .",
    "he concluded that @xmath48 can not be reached for the reason that matter can not be concentrated arbitrarily as otherwise the constituting particles would reach the speed of light and he conjectured that this behaviour will be exhibited in all cases .",
    "then , in @xcite he treated the problem of the influence of the universal expansion in local gravity fields and came up with a solution widely known as the einstein - straus vacuole , which is the basis of the swiss - cheese models , by matching an interior schwarzschild static cavity to an external friedman - lematre expanding universe for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "ironically , this is _ precisely _ the same matching as that in @xcite for closed universes and in time reversal .",
    "whenever two portions of given spacetimes are matched across corresponding proper hypersurfaces , the two discarded pieces in the given spacetimes also automatically match with exactly the same conditions : these are called  complementary matchings \" , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the einstein - straus model , when contemplated in its full _ past _ evolution , leads to a singularity and to regions with @xmath46 in the vacuum part of the space - time .    in summary , even though infinite values of physical observables must not be accepted in physical reality , one must be prepared to probe the limits of any particular theory , but this was reluctantly done in gr before 1955 despite many important indications that this was needed .",
    "a new generation of less prejudiced physicists and mathematicians was about to enter into play to take the question of the singularities seriously within the gr theory .",
    "as a final remark of historical importance and scientific relevance , let us mention that gdel wrote his famous paper @xcite with the solution named after him in a volume dedicated to einstein s 70th birthday .",
    "it is a  totally vicious \" solution of the field equations ( [ efe ] ) , meaning that there are closed timelike curves passing through every point of the manifold @xcite . nevertheless , gdel s space - time is geodesically complete , free of singularities , and rotating .",
    "he studied in further depth the case of rotating universes in a second paper @xcite .",
    "these papers are considered @xcite the genesis of many of the necessary techniques used in the path to the singularity theorems , specially concerning causality theory and actions of lie groups on the space - time , see @xcite .",
    "it may have also influenced raychaudhuri in the formulation of his fundamentally important equation , see next section .",
    "einstein died on 18th april 1955 and , coincidentally , less than one month later a new era started for gr with the publication of raychadhuri s paper containing the first ever singularity theorem @xcite . in this remarkable paper",
    ", he included a primitive form of the equation named after him , which is the basis of later developments and of _ all _ the singularity theorems , see subsection [ subsec : thms ] .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation can be readily derived from the ricci identity for a vector field @xmath54 @xmath55 by contracting @xmath38 with @xmath56 and then with @xmath57 , leading to @xmath58 and then reorganizing by parts the first summand on the left - hand side : @xmath59 nothing deep or mysterious here : raychaudhuri s contribution was to understand the deep physical implications of this simple geometrical relation . to start with ,",
    "note that if @xmath54 defines a ( affinely parametrized ) _ geodesic _ vector field , then @xmath60 and the third term in ( [ rayeq ] ) vanishes .",
    "the second term can be rewritten by splitting @xmath61}\\equiv s_{\\mu\\nu}+a_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] into its symmetric @xmath62 and antisymmetric @xmath63 parts , so that @xmath64 a one - form @xmath65 is proportional to an exact differential @xmath66 defining thereby orthogonal hypersurfaces @xmath67const. if and only if @xmath68 . moreover , assuming that @xmath69 is either null or timelike normalized , so that @xmath70 or @xmath71 , both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are non - negative .",
    "consequently , for hypersurface - orthogonal geodesic time - like or null vector fields @xmath69 , one has @xmath74 ergo the sign of the derivative of the divergence or _",
    "_ u^=s^ _ [ theta ] along the geodesic congruence is determined by that of @xmath75 .",
    "if the latter is non - negative , the former is non - positive . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath76 is negative ( positive ) at some point and @xmath77 it follows that @xmath76 will reach an infinite negative value in finite affine parameter to the future ( past ) unless all the quantities are zero everywhere .",
    "if ( a timelike ) @xmath54 describes the motion of a fluid moving along these geodesics , then a _ physical _ singularity develops , since the mean volume decreases and the density of the fluid will become unbounded , see subsection [ subsec : ray - kom ] .",
    "this was the situation treated in @xcite for the case of irrotational dust .",
    "in general , though , no singularity but rather a _ caustic _ along the flow lines of the congruence defined by @xmath69 is formed .",
    "this property is usually called the _ focusing effect _ on causal geodesics . for this to take place one",
    "needs the condition @xmath78 which is a _ geometric _ condition independent of the particular theory .",
    "( [ sec ] ) is called the _ timelike ( respectively null ) convergence condition _ when valid for timelike ( resp .",
    "null ) vector fields . in gr , of course , one can relate the ricci tensor to @xmath79 via ( [ efe ] ) and thereby condition ( [ sec ] ) can be rewritten in terms of physical quantities .",
    "this is why in the standard literature ( [ sec ] ) is many times called the _ strong energy condition _ in the case with @xmath41 @xcite , see subsection [ subsec : sec ] for a discussion .",
    "the main result found in @xcite can be stated as a singularity theorem for irrotational dust .",
    "this was almost immediately generalized , independently , by komar to the general situation of fluids @xcite .",
    "komar s paper contained basically the same ideas but the concept of an energy condition on @xmath79 such as ( [ sec ] ) when ( [ efe ] ) is taken into account was introduced .",
    "_ assuming _ that matter moves along a geodesic and hypersurface orthogonal timelike vector field @xmath54 a matter singularity can be obtained under some physically interesting circumstances . in modern terms",
    "the theorem can be stated as ( theorem 5.1 in @xcite ) :    assume @xmath41 and a perfect - fluid energy - momentum tensor t_=u_u_+p(g_+u_u _ ) , u^u_=-1 whose velocity vector field @xmath54 is geodesic and irrotational . if the expansion ( [ theta ] ) is positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) at an instant of time and ( [ sec ] ) holds , then the energy density @xmath80 of the fluid diverges in the finite past ( future ) along every integral curve of @xmath54.[th1 ]    the notion of ` an instant of time ' is meaningful here : as @xmath54 is geodesic and hypersurface - orthogonal we have @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a natural time coordinate for the fluid , and the assumption reads simply @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) .",
    "the key assumption in theorem [ th1 ] is the absence of acceleration and rotation , from where we learn that acceleration ( or rotation ) of matter becomes necessary to avoid singularities .",
    "this is physically reasonable for ( i ) acceleration is directly related to the existence of gradients of pressure , which are forces opposing gravitational attraction in general fluids ; and ( ii ) g \" odel s revolutionary papers @xcite proved that rotation could prevent the formation of singularities .",
    "this is also supported by newtonian cosmologies , in which rotation prevents the appearance of matter singularities , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "theorem [ th1 ] has one virtue that , as we will see in subsection [ subsec : thms ] , will be lost in the more advanced singularity theorems : it predicts that the singularity means a divergence of the energy density , and it says where to locate it .    approaching 1965",
    ", there were more singularity theorems based on equation ( [ rayeq ] ) , mainly dealing with spatially homogeneous ( bianchi ) cosmologies @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite were the basis for the later much studied bkl conjecture @xcite , see subsection [ subsec : bkl ] .",
    "to finish this section , we would like to remark that in 1963 kerr also discovered the first solution for a spinning mass @xcite later to become the unique metric of uncharged black holes @xcite .",
    "the focusing effect predicted by the raychaudhuri equation ( [ rayeq ] ) on causal geodesics emitted orthogonally from co - dimension 1 ( in the case of hypersurface - orthogonal timelike unit vector fields @xmath54 ) or from co - dimension 2 ( null vector field case ) submanifolds became a fundamental ingredient to derive the powerful singularity theorems .",
    "nevertheless , as remarked above , this focusing by itself does not lead to singularities in general . as a trivial example , observe that flat spacetime satisfies condition ( [ sec ] ) trivially , but it has no singularities : the focusing effect simply leads to focal points or caustics of the geodesic congruences .",
    "one therefore needs to combine the focusing of geodesics with other reasonable ingredients . in this respect ,",
    "the key turning point was the 1965 singularity theorem @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction of @xcite , penrose wanted to prove that deviations from spherical symmetry were not able to prevent the formation of singularities , such as those described in the oppenheimer - snyder collapse , within the gr theory . recall that there was a previous result by lematre in this direction , but it still needed a lot of symmetry ( spatial homogeneity ) ; work in @xcite also led to the conclusion that irregularities in non - spherical collapse were somehow suppressed by physical processes leading to a picture very similar to that of @xcite . to achieve his goal ,",
    "penrose brought in the idea of _ incompleteness _ to describe singular spacetimes ( subsection [ subsec : singularities ] ) , and he introduced the notion of _ closed trapped surface _ for the first time , a major conceptual contribution to the physics of the gravitational field ( subsection [ subsec : trapped ] ) . before discussing these two fundamental ideas let us present a modern version of penrose s theorem .",
    "[ th : p ] if the space - time contains a non - compact cauchy hypersurface @xmath85 and a closed future - trapped surface , and if the convergence condition ( [ sec ] ) holds for null @xmath54 , then there are future incomplete null geodesics .    for a proof of the theorem",
    "one can consult many references apart from @xcite , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a cauchy hypersurface @xcite is an `` instant of time '' that provides good initial value conditions for the _ entire _ space - time .",
    "more precisely , it is an achronal hypersurface which is met once and only once by all causal endless curves ( actually this follows if it is traversed by all endless null geodesics , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the pertinent property for the proof of theorem [ th : p ] , but there are other implications of the existence of a cauchy hypersurface which will be essential for later singularity theorems , namely , that this is equivalent to the space - time being globally hyperbolic @xcite , and the existence of maximal geodesics between any two causally related points , see subsection [ subsec : causalcond ] for details .",
    "if there is a cauchy hypersurface @xmath85 , then the space - time as a manifold is a product @xmath86 , all slices @xmath87 being diffeomorphic cauchy hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "the presence of a cauchy hypersurface is not guaranteed as was shown by penrose in another influential paper @xcite published almost simultaneously with @xcite where he discovered that plane waves in gr do not admit cauchy hypersurfaces .",
    "whether or not physically realistic spacetimes are globally hyperbolic is related to the so - called _ strong cosmic censorship _",
    "conjecture , see subsection [ subsec : cc ] .",
    "the strategy of the sketched proof presented in @xcite was to assume that null geodesics were complete , proving that then the boundary of the future of the closed trapped surface is compact . to do that one uses the focusing of null geodesics emanating orthogonally from the surface as follows from ( [ rayeq ] ) .",
    "but this boundary is actually an imbedded submanifold ( without boundary ! ) @xcite , while its canonical projection to @xmath85 would have to have a boundary as @xmath85 is non - compact .",
    "therefore , as argued in @xcite , one must choose among one of the following possibilities : ( [ sec ] ) is violated for null vectors , or the concept of space - time loses its meaning at extreme conditions ( maybe quantum effects ) , or some null geodesics are not complete .",
    "actually , these may all be inter - related .",
    "next , we discuss the idea of incompleteness , which under the influence of @xcite eventually became the standard definition of a singularity in gr .",
    "the problem of how to define a singularity in general relativity was very difficult indeed , see @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one expects that divergences of any physical or geometrical quantity would be a characteristic feature of singularities . however , there are problems of several kinds :    1 .",
    "singularities do not belong to the space - time which is by definition constituted of regular points .",
    "characterizing the singularities with misbehaviors of the curvature tensors may run into problems , as they may depend on a bad choice of basis @xcite , 3 .   even if one uses only curvature invariants independent of the bases it can happen that all of them vanish and still there are singularities .",
    "4 .   sometimes",
    ", singularities arise due to bad properties of the tangent bundle , for instance in conical singularities the main problem is a lack of independent tangent directions @xcite 5 .",
    "there are other known , more pathological , examples of spacetimes with vanishing curvature and incomplete geodesics @xcite 6 .",
    "sometimes there appear _ directional _ singularities , defined as limit points towards which the curvature tensor blows up along some , but not along other , directions @xcite    these complications led to an elaborated classification of possible singularities arising from the curvature tensors @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , incomplete physical curves may help here .",
    "curves are very good pointers , and using curves one employes objects that belong to the space - time exclusively .",
    "one can imagine the fate of a courageous traveler ( his / her worldline is a casual curve in the space - time ) approaching a singularity : he / she will disappear from our world in a _",
    "finite _ time .",
    "the time - reversal situation will describe the `` creation '' of the universe : things suddenly appeared from nowhere a _",
    "finite _ time ago .",
    "it seems thus sensible to diagnose the existence of singularities whenever there are ( hypothetical ) travelers which disappear , or materialize , abruptly .",

    "all singularity theorems after @xcite prove merely the existence of _ geodesic _ incompleteness , which of course is a _ sufficient _ condition for singular spacetimes according to the definition .",
    "nevertheless , there are known examples @xcite of geodesically complete space - times with incomplete time - like curves of everywhere bounded acceleration , ergo singular too . as far as we know",
    ", there is no known singularity theorem proving the existence of a geodesically complete singular space - time of this type .",
    "what is the relation between geodesic incompleteness and curvature misbehavior , if any ?",
    "on can actually prove limits on the curvature growth for maximal geodesics @xcite .",
    "the main result is that , along a causal incomplete geodesic with tangent vector @xmath88 , @xmath89 computed in a parallel propagated basis can not grow faster , in modulus , than @xmath90 when approaching the singularity at @xmath91 , where @xmath82 is an affine parameter ( proper time for timelike geodesics ) along the geodesic .",
    "it is certainly curious that one can put a limit on the curvature growth when approaching the end of an incomplete geodesic predicted by the theorems , but one does not know whether the curvature will diverge at all !",
    "however , some results pointing towards a curvature divergence can be found in @xcite .      in newtonian gravitation there is the important concept of escape velocity , providing the necessary initial condition for a small object to abandon a gravitational field eventually reaching infinity .",
    "thus , a good indication of a very strong gravitational field would be a very large escape velocity say close to that of light .",
    "in gr things are much more complicated , as one would expect .",
    "strong gravitational fields can distort the paths of light immensely .",
    "penrose cleverly invented an appropriate notion , _ closed trapped surfaces _ , capturing this intuitive but maybe vague idea of  possibility of getting away from a gravity field \" .",
    "as introduced in @xcite , a closed trapped surface is a two - dimensional imbedded submanifold @xmath92 ( surface ) , compact without boundary ( closed ) , such that the two families of light rays emerging orthogonally from @xmath92 towards the future converge initially ( trapped ) .",
    "an intuitive picture of this idea is presented in figure [ fig : senovilla1 ] .",
    "slice as a yellow circle sends light signals in the radial out- and in - going directions .",
    "these flashes form two new spheres after an infinitesimal time @xmath93 , as represented by the red ( ingoing ) and blue ( outgoing ) circles .",
    "the area of the former ( latter ) is smaller ( larger ) than the area of the orginal surface , which remains constant with time @xmath2 .",
    "however , if the universe is contracting , as shown on the right , both the blue and red surfaces can have areas smaller than that of the original surface _ at the initial time_. in this case , the surface is said to be future trapped .",
    "the limit case where the blue surface has precisely the area of the original surface at the initial time is termed _ marginally _ future trapped .",
    "( reproduced from @xcite ) ]    locally , the two family of light rays can be mathematically represented by a pair of future - directed affine - parametrized geodesic null vector fields @xmath94 , and the infinitesimal variation of the area of @xmath92 is measured by the respective expansions ( [ theta ] ) : @xmath95 .",
    "these are defined up to multiplicative factors , but only their signs are relevant here .",
    "thus , a closed future - trapped surface has _",
    "+ < 0 , _ - < 0 .",
    "[ trapped ] there is a dual definition of _ past_-trapped surface replacing future by past or , equivalently , keeping the future - pointing @xmath96 but reversing the signs in ( [ trapped ] ) .",
    "the notion of trapped surface is independent of the coordinates and of the existence of symmetries such as spherical or the axial symmetry present in kerr s solution @xcite .",
    "importantly , it is defined by using _ inequalities _",
    "( [ trapped ] ) , so that trapped surfaces remain stable under small perturbations ; this can be made mathematically precise within the space of lorentzian metrics @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a general concept devised to represent finite regions ( the interior of the surface ) which are somehow instantaneously fully confined by a gravitational field .",
    "it is easy to check that ( [ trapped ] ) is precisely the mathematical condition which generalizes the timelike character of the gradient of @xmath33 as it appeared in the earlier extensions of de sitter and of schwarzschild spacetimes ( for @xmath46 ) , as discussed above . for ,",
    "if the gradient of @xmath34 ( which measures the instantaneous variation of area ) is timelike , its scalar product with a future - pointing null vector is negative ( if @xmath97 is future ) , or positive ( if @xmath97 is past ) . but these scalar products are proportional to the expansions @xmath98 . in other words ,",
    "condition ( [ trapped ] ) is equivalent to @xmath97 being timelike future ( and past for the reversed signs ) .",
    "observe that actually this means that that the scalar product of @xmath97 with _ any _ future - pointing vector has the corresponding sign .",
    "hence , a future ( past ) trapped surface has an area that is initially decreasing along _ any _ possible future ( past ) direction .",
    "two important remarks :    * the one - form @xmath97 (  gradient of area \" ) , and its causal character , emerges as the key object to define the trapping of surfaces in known situations with spherical symmetry .",
    "we will see that this can be readily generalized , and the correct mathematical vector to be used is simply the _ mean curvature vector _ of @xmath92 @xcite . * from the discussion on de sitter and schwarzschild extensions in section [ sec : prehistory ] , and from the above definition and intuitive picture of closed trapped surfaces , one realizes that _ stationary _ regions can not accommodate them .",
    "this is actually a general result , see @xcite .",
    "the idea of closed trapped surface and its applications will be analyzed in deeper detail , with a more up - to - date perspective , in subsection [ subsec : trapped2 ] .",
    "penrose s singularity theorem shook the gr community .",
    "its impact was ample , profound and straightaway , see @xcite .",
    "a few months after @xcite was published , hawking @xcite realized that closed trapped surfaces , in its _ past _ version , will be present in any expanding universe close to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this started a series of papers by him , ellis , geroch and others on the question of the inevitability of an initial singularity in our past if gr is assumed to hold and some reasonable conditions are met .",
    "papers were even published in the same issue and consecutively , such as @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "hawking developed new ideas which despite some initial inaccuracies @xcite , when combined with those put forward in @xcite , formed the nucleus of the modern singularity theorems .",
    "in particular he borrowed from riemannian geometry the concept of focal and conjugate points ( essentially , these are the caustics predicted by ( [ rayeq ] ) ) and their significance explained by means of the first and second variation of the length integral @xcite : the outcome is that a timelike curve from a point ( respectively from a spacelike hypersurface @xmath85 ) maximizes the arc - length if and only if it is a geodesic ( orthogonal to @xmath85 ) , without corners and without conjugate ( resp .",
    "focal ) points , see @xcite .",
    "similar results , adequately adapted , hold for null geodesics from a point , or orthogonal to a spacelike surface .",
    "a theorem was proven by assuming a cauchy hypersurface @xmath85 , letting @xmath54 be the unit geodesic vector field orthogonal to @xmath85 on @xmath85 , and assuming that its expansion ( [ theta ] ) is bounded from below by a positive constant .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation leads then to all the geodesics tangent to @xmath54 having a finite length to the past , ergo the singularity @xcite .",
    "this mainly applied for non - compact @xmath85 , the compact case was treated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the previous theorem was improved and another theorem was found by assuming the existence of a point with re - converging light cones towards the past @xcite .",
    "this is much better adapted to what we know about the universe ( no need to assume an everywhere expanding slice ) , and the theorem was used in an important article @xcite to show that a combination of the two 1965 breakthroughs cosmic background radiation and singularity theorems gave strong indication that a singularity in our past was inevitable if one is to assume gr and condition ( [ sec ] ) holds everywhere .",
    "many other physical and mathematical developments were catalyzed by @xcite and the papers cited in the previous paragraph .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the recurrent idea of whether or not a quantum theory of gravity can extend solutions of classical gr beyond the singularities was analyzed for the first time .",
    "furthermore , the theory of causality , and of causality conditions , was developed and has become an integral part of gr .",
    "the foundations were established in @xcite for an abstract analysis of causal spaces , then the stable causality condition and time functions were introduced in @xcite , the relation between the topology of spatial sections and causality studied in @xcite , the basic properties of domain of dependence and global hyperbolicity given in @xcite , and a comprehensive summary provided in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "updated reviews are @xcite .",
    "another important ramification from the ideas behind the singularity theorems was the standard theory of black holes @xcite .",
    "it all started with another forceful paper by penrose @xcite where the fecund idea of conformal infinity was put forward , leading to a definition of ( weak ) asymptotic flatness @xcite and thereby to the notion of event horizon : the boundary of the past of future null infinity , see @xcite and for a recent review of conformal infinity @xcite .",
    "eventually , a considerable improvement in the understanding of the conditions under which a space - time must be singular was accomplished by hawking and penrose @xcite in what is still considered the preeminent singularity theorem .",
    "later , excellent condensations of the techniques and results behind the theorems , with lengthy enlightening discussions , were given in @xcite .",
    "the hawking - penrose result is based on the fundamental observation that the following three things are incompatible :    * every endless causal geodesic has conjugate points * there are no closed timelike curves * there is a set whose future ( or past ) has a compact boundary    these last sets are called `` trapped sets '' in the literature @xcite , but they are not to be confused with trapped surfaces .",
    "the concept of trapped surface is local , there is no need to know the structure of its future or past .",
    "however , one can prove , following the ideas in @xcite , that a closed trapped surface will become a trapped set whenever the space - time possesses complete null geodesics @xcite .",
    "the same can be said of points with reconverging light cones , and of compact imbedded hypersurfaces . to enforce the first of the three conditions",
    "usually ( [ sec ] ) is enough , but to avoid exceptional situations one also needs to add the so - called _ generic _ condition : u_[r_]u^u^0.[gen ] for timelike @xmath54 this can be written in the simpler form @xmath99 .",
    "physically this means that the tidal force felt by causal curves will not always and everywhere be aligned with their tangent vectors .",
    "of course , there are spacetimes where this condition will not hold , but they are very special indeed , see subsection [ subsec : sec ] .    as a corollary one has the theorem    [ th : hp ] if the convergence ( [ sec ] ) and generic ( [ gen ] ) conditions hold for causal vectors , there are no closed timelike curves and there exists at least one of the following :    * a closed achronal imbedded hypersurface * a closed trapped surface , * a point with re - converging light cone    then the space - time has incomplete causal geodesics .    even though originally proven in 4-dimensional spacetimes , theorem [ th : hp ] actually holds in arbitrary dimension",
    "in which case the closed trapped surface is a co - dimension two trapped submaniolfd .    in the next subsection we present an assessment of this and other classical singularity theorems , the ideas behind their proofs , and a discussion of their assumptions .",
    "since the publication of @xcite there have been many papers proving singularity theorems , mainly trying to relax the assumptions , to refine their conclusions and/or to enhance their possible physical implications .",
    "letting aside some subtleties , they are usually interpreted as providing evidence of the ( classical ) singular beginning of the universe and of the singular final fate of massive compact stars .",
    "a more up - to - date perspective would rather state that they provide very solid evidence of the need of ( possibly quantum ) corrections to gr when extreme gravity effects occur .    some selected improved theorems are :    * adding alternatives to the trapped sets in theorem [ th : hp ] and some topological considerations for the case of non - simply connected space - times @xcite * relaxing ( [ sec ] ) to some milder averaged condition along geodesics , e.g. @xcite * related to the previous , theorems which allow for the violation of ( [ sec ] ) to accommodate inflationary models @xcite ( more on this in section [ sec : xxi ] ) * quantifying somehow the curvature growth along incomplete geodesics and proving the existence of a _",
    "maximal _ incomplete geodesic , that is , one maximizing proper time between any two of its points @xcite * weakening the causality assumption that forbids closed timelike curves @xcite .",
    "this work was later improved in @xcite assuming that the boundary of the set of points where there are closed causal curves is compact , see also @xcite .",
    "a further improvement was found in @xcite , which contains all previous results * using conformal embeddings of the space - time into larger ones fulfilling the necessary assumptions @xcite and other kind of envelopments @xcite * theorems specially tailored for some specific situations , such as singularities in colliding plane waves @xcite , see @xcite for a complete review .",
    "* theorems independent of ( [ efe ] ) , just assuming a metric connection and appropriate conditions such as ( [ sec ] ) , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is related to the study of singularity theorems in alternative theories , mainly based on rewriting the field equations in einstein form ( [ efe ] ) with an `` effective '' energy - momentum tensor , see @xcite .",
    "there will be more modern singularity theorems discussed in section [ sec : xxi ] .",
    "such a diversity of theorems do not have to cause too much concern to the reader . to understand their main implications and applications one can use an appropriate pattern theorem because , as argued in @xcite , they _ all _ share the same structural framework as condensed in the following    [ th : pattern ] if a space - time of sufficient differentiability satisfies    1 .",
    "a condition on the curvature 2 .   a causality condition 3 .   and",
    "an appropriate initial and/or boundary condition    then it contains endless but incomplete causal geodesics .",
    "the assumption of sufficient differentiability is often ignored despite its mathematical and physical relevance .",
    "the singularity theorems hold if the metric @xmath100 is twice differentiable with continuity .",
    "a breakdown of such differentiability is not a true singularity , specially if the first derivatives of @xmath100 satisfy the lipshitz condition .",
    "recall that the entire metric of finite objects ( stars or galaxies ) is usually split into two different regions matched together at the surface of the body such that the @xmath100 _ can not _ be twice differentiable in gr : a jump in the matter density from the interior to the exterior is directly related to the discontinuity of the second derivatives of @xmath100 via equations ( [ efe ] ) . as an example , the oppenheimer - snyder collapsing model ( or its complementary einstein - straus vacuole ) can not have a twice differentiable metric .",
    "hence , this assumption is restrictive from a physical viewpoint , as actually realized , and briefly discussed , in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "a list of the very many places where the differentiability assumption is used to prove the singularity theorems can be found in @xcite .",
    "all singularity theorems _ necessitate _ a condition involving the riemann tensor @xmath101 .",
    "these are usually presented under the names of `` energy '' and/or `` generic '' conditions but , as explained in formula ( [ sec ] ) , this assumption is of a _",
    "geometric nature_. mostly , the used conditions are ( [ sec ] ) and ( [ gen ] ) or appropriate averaged versions thereof . the generic condition ( [ gen ] ) is rarely violated , only in very special or symmetric situations fails .",
    "an interesting example is provided by the einstein static universe : it contains trapped sets ( compact slices , and points with reconverging light cones ) , satisfies ( [ sec ] ) and is globally hyperbolic , yet it is geodesically complete .    condition ( [ sec ] ) can be re - expressed using ( [ efe ] ) , but only in gr . however , ( [ sec ] ) depends then on the sign of @xmath0 and today we know that @xmath102 , just the wrong sign for the theorems .",
    "alternative or more general theories of gravity retain the theorems , but their formulation in terms of  energy \" conditions depends on the field equations of the particular theory .    even in gr and independently of @xmath0 the curvature assumption does not always hold @xcite _ classically _ , such as for scalar fields and other realistic type of matter .",
    "actually , inflationary cosmological models violate it .",
    "notice , however , that as discussed in the previous list of improved theorems , some of them deal successfully with this problem .",
    "for a wider discussion on energy conditions see @xcite , in relation with the theorems @xcite , and for a more recent perspective @xcite .",
    "the curvature condition enforces the geodesic focusing via the raychaudhuri equation ( [ rayeq ] ) , and thereby is absolutely indispensable .",
    "the causality condition is used in two respects :    * to prevent the possibility of traveling to one s own past * to ensure the existence of geodesics of maximal proper time between events    the first of these is not superfluous since gdel s space - time contains closed time - like lines , but also reconverging light cones @xcite ( and minimal surfaces @xcite ) , still all its geodesics are complete . as mentioned above",
    ", this part of the assumption can be substantially relaxed : it is enough that a region without closed timelike curves is causally separated from the set of points in such curves , see @xcite .",
    "the second point is more important , and is related to the existence of cauchy hypersurfaces .",
    "these do not have to exist in general spacetimes .",
    "nevertheless , in a majority of situations there will be _ partial _ cauchy hypersurfaces : slices adapted to give initial conditions which fully determine the space - time in their domain of dependence @xcite , these domains may not be the entire space - time but they are , by themselves , _ globally hyperbolic _ spacetimes .",
    "the proofs of the theorem always use such globally hyperbolic portions due to the following fundamental property : global hyperbolicity demands that the space of all causal curves between any two events is compact @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the property that the intersection of the past of any point with the future of any other point is compact too .",
    "and then one can prove the existence of geodesics maximizing proper time between any two points of the globally hyperbolic portions of the space - time .",
    "the interesting fact here is that these maximal geodesics can not have focal / conjugate points ( and their pencils can not have caustics ) , @xcite . and",
    "this is the essential property used in the theorems , as explained in what follows .",
    "recapitulating , from the curvature condition one has focusing of all causal geodesics , ergo the existence of _ caustics and focal points _ due to the focusing effect implied by the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "simultaneously , the causality condition warrants the existence of geodesics of maximal proper time , hence necessarily _ without focal points _ , joining pairs of events of the space - time .",
    "a contradiction seems to twinkle  if causal geodesics are complete . despite appearances ,",
    "however , there is no such contradiction yet .",
    "the missing clue is that we have not enforced a finite upper bound for the proper time of selected families of causal geodesics . to get a contradiction with",
    "geodesic completeness one needs to add the initial / boundary condition ( positive expansion of slices , closed trapped surfaces , etc . ) .",
    "this is why it took some time to understand how to combine the focusing effect with the existence of geodesics maximizing the arc - length to get _ geodesic incompleteness_. the imaginative notion of closed trapped surface introduced in @xcite later generalized to compact slices and points with reconverging light cones eventually closed the gap .",
    "geodesic incompleteness can not be proven without the initial / boundary condition . there",
    "exist globally hyperbolic spacetimes , satisfying the _ strict _ inequality ( [ sec ] ) for all causal vectors , with everywhere expanding cauchy hypersurfaces , but free of singularities @xcite . in these examples all geodesics are complete .",
    "they can avoid the conclusions of the singularity theorems because the initial / boundary condition simply fails @xcite , and therefore there is no finite bound for the maximal proper times .",
    "the focussing effect takes place fully , and at the same time there are maximal timelike geodesics , without focal points , between any two causally related events . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the initial / boundary condition is absolutely essential in the theorems .    whether or not the initial or boundary condition is satisfied by actual physical systems is debatable .",
    "we will probably never know if the _",
    "universe not only the observable one is spatially finite , or strictly expanding now .",
    "thus , the formation of closed trapped surfaces in the collapse of physical systems given some realistic initial conditions has become the main area of research to elucidate this question , see end of subsection [ subsec : trapped2 ] .",
    "one can also follow a similar program , towards the past , in the case of the expansing universe .",
    "of course , the formation of closed trapped surfaces may depend critically on the given initial conditions , so that this is an area of active research and great relevance in numerical and mathematical relativity now , see section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the geometrical basis for the proofs have been implicitly discussed in the previous paragraphs . from a physical point of view",
    ", the proofs of the main theorems [ th : p ] , [ th : hp ] and their improvements can be understood , schematically , as explicated next .",
    "the boundary / initial condition provides us with a set _ bound to become a trapped set _ ( remember that a trapped set has a future ( or past ) with compact boundary ) .",
    "one of two things will happen : either the set actually becomes a trapped set , or not . in the last possibility",
    "the failure to become a trapped set implies a failure of completeness , whence the singularity . in the former case",
    ", one may consider the whole future of the _ compact _ boundary of the future of the initial set .",
    "this is actually a future cauchy development , which may describe the entire future or not , in the second case one knows that the boundary of this domain is _ non - compact_. the only way that this can happen is by having endless geodesics which never reach this future boundary .",
    "therefore , there are some geodesics that either reach a singularity or go out to infinity .    in the last possibility",
    "the geodesic reaching infinity will have a particle horizon ( boundary of its entire past ) which is compact or reaches a singularity .",
    "the reasoning proceeds then as before but to the past . if again we end up with a geodesic that comes from infinity , its combination with the first one produces the possibility of travelling indefinitely from the past to the future , remaining within a finite spatial region and avoiding the focusing effect .",
    "but this is not possible if ( [ sec ] ) or its averaged versions hold .",
    "one can extract the following conclusion : under appropriate curvature conditions , gr favours incomplete geodesics versus trapped sets .",
    "sometimes , this is a kind of a mystery , for the incomplete geodesics arise even in completely empty spacetimes .",
    "notice that the intuitive idea that singularities must have something to do with the existence of concentrated matter is then lost . a particular illustrative case of this situation is given by colliding wave spacetimes @xcite , which only contain pure gravitational waves without matter , including realistic cases without plane symmetry and finite wave profiles @xcite .",
    "one may try to argue , perhaps , that there is a lot of gravitational energy localized in extremely small regions in this case .",
    "the weakest point of the singularity theorems is their conclusions . in most cases",
    "this is very mild , as it can be a mere localized singularity .",
    "the theorems do not say anything , in general , about the situation , strength , extension and character of the singularity",
    ". one can not even know whether it is in the future or past .",
    "all one knows is that there exists , at least , one incomplete causal geodesic",
    ". nevertheless , there are some results proving that the incomplete geodesics predicted by the theorems lead to singularities that , in general , if they are essential and not very specialized @xcite , will indicate a divergence of the curvature , see for instance @xcite .",
    "what are the observational consequences of the singularity theorems ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on another question : can we see singularities ?",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime ( [ kot ] ) with @xmath41 contains a singularity ; but it is inside the black hole event horizon @xmath42 , and is therefore not visible to observers outside the black hole . even for observers inside the black hole ,",
    "the singularity is always towards their future , and the observer can not see the singularity before encountering it .",
    "this leads to the question of whether gravitational collapse produces singularities that are like the singularity of schwarzschild in these respects @xcite , that is , are the singularities produced in gravitational collapse hidden inside black hole event horizons ? ( weak cosmic censorship ) and are singularities non - timelike ? ( strong cosmic censorship ) .",
    "the issue of cosmic censorship is sometimes viewed as one of the consistency of the theory , in other words that it would somehow be a disaster for general relativity if cosmic censorship were false . however",
    ", this is probably not the right way to look at things for the following reason : general relativity is itself an approximation obtained by ignoring the quantum nature of the gravitational field . at sufficiently large spacetime curvature ( such as would be expected to occur near a spacetime singularity ) this approximation breaks down . thus we will need quantum gravity to understand the true nature of singularities .",
    "cosmic censorship can thus be viewed as the question of whether the effects of quantum gravity are visible in the process of gravitational collapse , or more succinctly : do astrophysicists need to know quantum gravity ?",
    "ideally one would like to formulate cosmic censorship as a precise mathematical conjecture and then find a proof or a counterexample .",
    "however , this turns out to be quite difficult .",
    "recall that ultimately one is interested in the astrophysical process of gravitational collapse .",
    "therefore an overly naive formulation of a cosmic censorship conjecture might be vulnerable to what from the astrophysical point of view looks like an artificial counterexample .",
    "for example one can easily produce `` naked singularities '' @xcite simply by removing regions from minkowski spacetime @xcite or by collapsing spherically symmetric dust . rather than",
    "regard cosmic censorship as refuted by these simple counterexamples , one refines the condition of the conjecture to rule out such counterexamples .",
    "of course , one could view this conjecture refining process as unfairly making cosmic censorship invulnerable to refutation by  larding on conditions \" ( as one eminent astrophysicist put it ) . here",
    "the only ( admittedly vague ) response is that if faced with an  astrophysically realistic \" counterexample one should give up the fight rather than add a condition to rule it out . for an extensive treatment ( including a somewhat precise version ) of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one strategy to use with a conjecture is to search for a proof and also to search for a counterexample .",
    "if a wide class of possible counterexamples can be shown to fail , then this can be regarded as evidence for the probable truth of the conjecture . for weak cosmic censorship",
    ", one possible counterexample would be a process that turns a black hole into a naked singularity . recall that the reissner - nordstrm metric with ( in natural units ) mass @xmath103 and charge @xmath104 represents a black hole if @xmath105 and a naked singularity if @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , the kerr metric with mass @xmath103 and angular momentum @xmath107 represents a black hole if @xmath108 and a naked singularity if @xmath109 .",
    "thus , one way to produce a naked singularity would be to `` overcharge '' or `` overspin '' a black hole .",
    "at first it might seem easy to overcharge a black hole : just shoot enough particles of charge @xmath110 into the black hole until finally the black hole s charge exceeds its mass .",
    "however , it turns out that this process does nt work : for @xmath110 the same sign as @xmath104 , the black hole will repel the charged particle . the particle will therefore need enough energy to overcome the repulsion , and this energy will be incorporated into the mass of the black hole . though the black hole charge increases in this process , so does its mass , and in such a way that the charge does not exceed the mass . similarly , spinning black holes repel the particles whose angular momentum would increase their spin , and this `` spin - spin repulsion '' prevents the overspinning of a black hole .",
    "in a similar vein , penrose showed @xcite that if a certain inequality ( now called the _ penrose inequality _ ) involving the area of a marginally ( outer ) future - trapped surface @xmath92 the `` apparent horizon'' and the mass of the initial hypersurface containing @xmath92 were violated , then the spacetime that comes from evolving the initial data would contain a naked singularity .",
    "to date , the penrose inequality has been proven only in some special cases , while no counterexample has been found either , see subsection [ subsec : ineq ] for further details and a longer discussion .    in a globally hyperbolic spacetime",
    ", there can be no timelike singularities .",
    "thus , one way of formulating strong cosmic censorship is as the statement that ( under suitable conditions ) spacetime must be globally hyperbolic .",
    "an initial data set has a maximal cauchy development , which is a globally hyperbolic spacetime ; however that maximal cauchy development may not be the whole spacetime .",
    "thus strong cosmic censorship is the statement that generically the maximal cauchy development is inextendible . here",
    ", the word `` generically '' is used because there are known special cases where the maximal development is extendible , so without some sort of generic condition , this version of cosmic censorship would fail .",
    "theorems on maximal cauchy developments come under the heading of global results for partial differential equations .",
    "they are generally very difficult to prove ( cases with spacetime symmetries are more tractable ) and must be done separately for each type of matter ( vacuum , einstein - maxwell , etc . ) . for a discussion of results of this type see @xcite .",
    "one idea for producing naked singularities comes from considering some properties of the schwarzschild spacetime ( [ kot ] ) with @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath103 be the schwarzschild black hole mass , so that the constant @xmath38 in ( [ kot ] ) reads @xmath111 .",
    "then the spacetime curvature at radius @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath112 while the radius of the event horizon is @xmath38 .",
    "it then follows that the maximum curvature that is visible to outside observers is proportional to @xmath113 , that is , to @xmath114 .",
    "thus the ability to produce arbitrarily small black holes is the ability to produce arbitrarily large curvature visible to outside observers .",
    "therefore in the limit , a configuration of matter that collapses to form a `` zero mass black hole '' actually forms a naked singularity .",
    "is there such a configuration of matter ? in his mathematical studies of the collapse of a spherically symmetric self - gravitating scalar field @xcite christodoulou proved the existence of just such a configuration of matter .",
    "but what are the properties of such a `` zero mass black hole '' ? and what happens to configurations of the scalar field that are close to the configuration that produces it ?",
    "these questions were addressed in @xcite and nicely answered by choptuik @xcite in his numerical simulations of spherically symmetric scalar field collapse .",
    "choptuik considered a family of initial data specified by a parameter @xmath115 which when evolved results in dispersal of the scalar field for small @xmath115 and formation of a black hole for large @xmath115 .",
    "there is thus some critical value @xmath116 which marks the boundary between those configurations that form black holes and those that do nt .",
    "choptuik found that for @xmath115 close to , but greater than @xmath116 there is a scaling relation for the mass @xmath103 of the black hole @xmath117 furthermore there is a universality in this relation in the sense that picking a different one parameter family of initial data leads to the same scaling relation with the same value of @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , the critical solution ( the one that results from the evolution of the @xmath119 data ) has the property of discrete self - similarity : after a certain amount of time the scalar field evolves to the same profile , but with the scale of space shrunk by a factor of @xmath120 . the collapse process then continues , for an infinite number of times , on an ever smaller scale of space and time , until it finally results in the formation of a naked singularity in a finite amount of proper time .",
    "the critical solution ( and the value of the constant @xmath121 ) are also universal in the sense that they do not depend on which one parameter family of initial data is chosen .",
    "though the critical solution contains a naked singularity , the production of the naked singularity only occurs for one value of @xmath115 in the family and thus would not occur for generic initial data .",
    "thus ( as for the case of strong cosmic censorship ) a viable version of weak cosmic censorship takes the form that naked singularities do not result from the evolution of _ generic _ initial data .",
    "there is a connection between the critical solution and the mass scaling relation : the critical solution has one unstable mode , which grows exponentially as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant and @xmath82 is a logarithmic time variable .",
    "it then follows that for @xmath115 near @xmath116 any geometric quantity with dimension of length satisfies a scaling relation of the form of eqn .",
    "( [ chopmass ] ) with @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , since the parameter @xmath38 in ( [ kot ] ) ( the black hole _ mass _ in natural units ) has the dimension of length , it satisfies eqn .",
    "( [ chopmass ] ) .",
    "note , that this explanation of scaling requires only that @xmath115 is near @xmath116 , not that @xmath125 .",
    "in particular , for subcritical collapse ( i.e. where @xmath126 and therefore a black hole does not form ) there is some maximum value @xmath127 achieved by the spacetime curvature during the collapse process . since the maximum spacetime curvature is a geometric invariant , it follows @xcite that it satisfies a scaling relation of the form @xmath128 where @xmath118 is the same constant that occurs in the black hole mass scaling relation .",
    "critical collapse has been studied for many forms of matter in spherical symmetry : perfect fluids @xcite , complex scalar fields @xcite , yang - mills fields @xcite etc .",
    "it has also been studied in axisymmetry for vacuum @xcite and with scalar field matter @xcite .",
    "there is even a preliminary result for the case with no symmetry @xcite . in all cases there",
    "is a scaling relation for black hole mass , and there is a critical solution that is either discretely self - similar or continuously self - similar . here",
    "the value of @xmath118 ( and @xmath121 in the discretely self - similar case ) depends on the type of matter . for results on critical collapse ,",
    "see the review @xcite and references therein .",
    "as remarked in subsection [ subsubsec : conclusion ] , one disadvantage of the singularity theorems is that they give very little information on the nature of singularities .",
    "one normally thinks of gravitational collapse as producing an all encompassing singularity at which spacetime curvature blows up , and at which all observers who enter the black hole end their existence .",
    "however , as explained in section [ sec : impact ] , the singularity theorems do nt say all that , merely stating that for some unspecified reason some observer or light ray ends .",
    "nonetheless , there may be a simple , general description of the properties of singularities for the following reason : as with all gravitational phenomena , singularities are described by the einstein field equations .",
    "if curvature blows up at spacetime singularities , so should some terms in the field equations",
    ". if terms in the field equations blow up at different rates , then a truncated set of field equations , in which only the dominant terms are kept , should give an accurate asymptotic picture of the approach to the singularity .",
    "the trick is to guess which terms in the field equations are dominant and then to somehow verify that that guess is correct .",
    "such a guess was provided by belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifschitz ( bkl)@xcite and usually referred to as the bkl conjecture .",
    "bkl write the field equations in a synchronous coordinate system where time to the singularity is the time coordinate .",
    "they then assume that the dominant terms in the field equations are those involving time derivatives ( with the terms involving spatial derivatives being less important ) .",
    "they then verify that their guess is consistent with the field equations .",
    "note that in the bkl picture , the singularity occurs at @xmath129 in a synchronous coordinate system , and is therefore spacelike , in accordance with strong cosmic censorship .",
    "since spatial derivatives are neglected , this means that at each spatial point the dynamics is that of a homogeneous ( but anisotropic ) cosmology , and that each spatial point s dynamics decouples from the dynamics of the other points , so that the singularity dynamics is local . furthermore , since the most general dynamics for homogeneous , anisotropic cosmologies is the oscillatory dynamics of the bianchi type ix ( mixmaster ) spacetime @xcite , bkl singularities are oscillatory .",
    "in addition , the terms in the field equations due to the anisotropy blow up faster than those of the stress - energy ( except for scalar field matter ) and so the singularity is well described by the vacuum field equations . in summary , in the bkl picture singularities are spacelike , local , and oscillatory , and  matter does nt matter . \"",
    "but is the bkl picture right ?",
    "objections were raised in @xcite including the fact that synchronous coordinates based on a singularity can not be assumed to be smooth , and that consistency of an asymptotic scheme with the field equations does not preclude the possibility of different asymptotic regimes that are also consistent with the field equations ; nor does it mean that a general evolution towards a singularity gets itself into that asymptotic regime .    in order to resolve these questions , berger and moncrief @xcite ( and later several of their collaborators @xcite ) embarked on a program of numerical simulations of spacetime singularities .",
    "the idea was to pick some ( fairly general ) initial data , numerically evolve it towards the singularity , and see whether the evolution accorded with the bkl conjecture .",
    "as with many research programs in numerics , one starts with situations with symmetries and then gradually works towards the general case of no symmetry .",
    "berger and moncrief started with the gowdy spacetimes @xcite , which have two spacelike killing vectors .",
    "( a special class of gowdy spacetimes , where the killing vectors are hypersurface - orthogonal , had been treated mathematically by isenberg and moncrief @xcite and shown to be well described by the bkl picture ) . aside from their symmetries ,",
    "one feature of the gowdy spacetimes , that makes them less challenging to study , is that they only undergo a finite number of bkl oscillations .",
    "the berger - moncrief simulations showed that the bkl picture is a good description of singularities , however they also uncovered a new complication that is now called `` spikes . ''",
    "these are spatial points where the dynamics is sufficiently different from those of neighboring points to give rise to a steep spatial feature of ever narrowing width .",
    "these spikes are a challenge to the numerics , and also a challenge to obtaining a mathematical proof that the gowdy spacetimes satisfy the bkl conjecture . nonetheless , despite these difficulties , such a proof was finally obtained by ringstrm @xcite .",
    "berger and moncrief went on to numerically simulate @xmath130 spacetimes @xcite which have only one spatial symmetry , and obtained results in agreement with the bkl picture .",
    "finally , the general case with no symmetries was simulated in @xcite using a somewhat different method based on the scale invariant tetrad system of @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite agree with the bkl picture , however with not enough spatial points to resolve the spikes .",
    "work to improve this simulation to resolve the spikes is in progress .    for results on the numerical studies of singularities",
    "see the review @xcite and references therein .",
    "though the bkl picture is consistent with the einstein field equations , and is a good description of at least some singularities , there remains the possibility of other pictures , also consistent with the field equations and describing another class of spacetime singularities .",
    "such a picture was developed by poisson and israel @xcite based on the properties of inner horizons of black holes .",
    "the inner horizon of a reissner - nordstrm black hole is a null hypersurface and is unstable in the sense that small perturbations blow up on the horizon .",
    "poisson and israel argue that these perturbations would turn the horizon into a singularity , but that it would retain its null character . furthermore , since the kerr metric also has a null inner horizon , and since the black hole uniqueness theorems tell us that a general black hole settles down to the kerr metric , the picture of @xcite should be a good general description of ( at least part of ) the singularity inside a black hole .",
    "the null singularity picture is supported by general arguments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite and mathematical results @xcite .",
    "if both the bkl picture and the null singularity picture are correct , then an observer who stays with the star as it is collapsing should encounter a bkl singularity , while an observer who enters the black hole long after it forms should encounter a null singularity .",
    "the study of string theory has led to a wide consideration of the properties of general relativity in more than 4 spacetime dimensions , and in particular to the study of higher dimensional analogs of black holes .",
    "one of the simplest such analogs is the 5 dimensional black string , which is simply the metric product of @xmath131 and the 4 dimensional schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "though the schwarzshilid metric is stable to small perturbations , it turns out the the black string is unstable @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the question of what is the endstate of a perturbed black string .",
    "based on entropic considerations , it was argued in @xcite that the black string would pinch off to become separated 5 dimensional black holes .",
    "however it was shown in @xcite that any such pinch off would necessitate the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "do black strings violate cosmic censorship ? to resolve this question , numerical simulations of the evolution of a perturbed black string",
    "were performed @xcite .",
    "the result of the simulations is that the unstable black string undergoes a cascade of formation of ever smaller spatial structures finally resulting in a pinch off in a finite amount of time .",
    "thus black strings form naked singularities !",
    "we are thus left with the odd situation that the best evidence we have at this point indicates that cosmic censorship holds in 4 spacetime dimensions but is violated in 5 spacetime dimensions .",
    "many of the developments instigated by @xcite and the singularity theorems have been already discussed or mentioned , such as cosmic censorship , causality theory , global hyperbolicity and cauchy hypersurfaces , domain of dependence , conformal infinity , or black hole uniqueness theorems .",
    "the ideas behind the ( proofs of the ) singularity theorems have been applied to several important results in gr , such as the positive mass theorem in its original version @xcite as argued in @xcite , or more recently in @xcite ( for a restricted class of spacetimes ) using the lorentzian splitting theorems @xcite . similarly , in @xcite the global structure of spacetimes with positive cosmological constant under the assumption of the existence of the conformal compactification is analyzed deriving strong restrictions on the topology of space by using standard arguments taken from singularity theorems .    in this section",
    "we would like to put the emphasis on three important lines of research that , in one way or another , have their origin in the outstanding paper @xcite and have become branches of gr by themselves .",
    "these are : boundaries of spacetime , trapped submanifolds , and isoperimetric inequalities and the  hoop conjecture \" .",
    "singularities clearly reach , or come from , the _ edge _ of space - time .",
    "this is some kind of boundary which is not part of , but is accessible from within , the space - time .",
    "thus the necessity of a rigourous definition of the boundary of a space - time .",
    "this boundary may even have relevance for string theory and the famous ads / cft correspondence , see @xcite .",
    "penrose himself started this quest with the introduction of conformal infinity and conformal compactification @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to implant the space - time into a larger lorentzian manifold by a _",
    "embedding , which ensures that the causal properties are invariant .",
    "if the original manifold obtains a boundary in the larger one , then this is defined as the conformal boundary .",
    "this allows one to treat properties of infinity , and in particular to study the properties of radiative space - times .",
    "moreover , the boundary , being a subset of the larger manifold , inherits causal properties itself so that it acquires attributes which allow one to place it into the future or past , and to call it spacelike , null or timelike . using these developments",
    "penrose was able to produce explicit expressions for the gravitational power radiated `` at infinity '' by an isolated system as an integral  there \" @xcite in a fully coordinate - independent geometrical manner , see for further details @xcite .",
    "the conformal compactification can be carried out for spacetimes such as de sitter or the friedman models .",
    "this showed that singularities such as the  creation time \" are part of the boundary , and thereby they also inherit some causal properties .",
    "in general , however , the full conformal compactification is a chimera .",
    "nevertheless , friedrich has been able to establish a procedure such that it is possible to write down a set of equations , called the conformal field equations , that allow one to treat the problem of the existence of solutions given data at infinity as well as other relevant issues concerning conformal infinity , see e.g. @xcite and for a review @xcite .",
    "even if the full conformal compactification is not feasible , sometimes it is possible to perform the conformal compactification of two - dimensional subsets of the space - time providing relevant information .",
    "this is the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes where one can safely ignore the angular part of the space - time and deal only with the ( 2-dimensional ) orthogonal planes .",
    "similarly , one can concentrate on particularly relevant 2-dimensional surfaces ( ergo conformally flat ) of any given spacetime .",
    "in these cases we can draw two dimensional pictures , called _",
    "penrose diagrams _",
    "@xcite or _",
    "conformal diagrams _ , obtaining information about singularities , infinity , and the global causal structure of the space - time .",
    "a paradigmatic example is the diagram of kerr s space - time axis of symmetry , first found by carter @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "these extremely useful representations of spacetimes have been used largely in gr @xcite and , today , they are routinely drawn in many papers and extensively utilized in live discussions among scientists working on gravitation .",
    "once the definition of a singularity as an incomplete curve was settled , geroch started a new line of research concerning boundaries .",
    "he introduced the _ geodesic boundary _ , or g - boundary , building equivalence classes of endless incomplete geodesics and a notion of proximity between them @xcite .",
    "a good property of the g - boundary is that a metric structure and thus some local properties of certain singularities can be defined sometimes .",
    "unfortunately , the g - boundary has a number of problems and does not consider non - geodesic curves , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a more complete structure is obtained with the _ bundle boundary _ or b - boundary due to schmidt @xcite , based on the completion of a riemannian metric defined on the frame bundle of the space - time .",
    "the difficulties for applying this construction are enormous and , furthermore , the cases explicitly computed have led to highly unexpected results . yet another program was launched in @xcite with the definition of the _ abstract boundary _ or a - boundary .",
    "this is a very general framework , actually defined for any manifold independently of having a connection or a metric , that intends to collect every possible boundary point arising in all the envelopments of a given manifold . in the case of spacetimes",
    ", the boundary points can be classified by using appropriate families of curves with definite properties ( such as geodesics or others ) , leading to ( possibly directional ) singularities , points at infinity , and some other cases @xcite .",
    "another definition of boundary was given in @xcite combining the idea of envelopment with the original idea of conformal embedding but using the novel concept of isocausality , leading also to a generalization of conformal diagrams .",
    "this approach is more versatile than the original conformal one , but there are some subtleties @xcite that are yet to be understood .",
    "probably the most important approach was put forward in @xcite with the definition of the _ causal boundary _ or c - boundary , improving on previous similar ideas that appeared in @xcite . the idea behind",
    "the c - boundary construction is to use the future or the past of endless curves which , somehow intuitively , approach either singularities or points at infinity .",
    "the set of all ( indecomposable into smaller sets of the same form ) past and future sets can be considered as a completion containing all points in @xmath132 plus the c - boundary .",
    "some identification procedure must then be used to remove duplication of boundary points , and this may lead to great difficulties , see also @xcite . the c - boundary then entered into a history of improvements too large to be detailed here , see @xcite , though perhaps all the issues have been finally settled , see @xcite .    for a more complete discussion on space - time boundaries up to 2005 see the review @xcite , and for the more recent advances and the latest on the c - boundary , check @xcite and references therein .",
    "indubitably , the most important legacy of the 1965 singularity theorem is the fundamental notion of closed trapped surface , a certainly prolific idea with many applications .",
    "it is not only very useful in the general analysis of gravitational collapse , in the formation of black holes @xcite , and in cosmic censorship , numerical relativity ( section [ sec : numerics ] ) and isoperimetric inequalities ( subsection [ subsec : ineq ] ) , it has also become an object of interest for mathematicians see for instance the use of trapped surfaces to prove the decay rate of gravitational radiation flux @xcite  and it has evolved into a richer fauna of interesting  trapped - like \" submanifolds with many geometrical and physical implications .    as remarked several times in this paper , trapped surfaces",
    "manifest themselves as having a  wrong \" causal character of a specific vector field orthogonal to the surface :  the gradient of @xmath34 is timelike \" , where @xmath33 is the area of the surface .",
    "this actually leads to the best definition of trapped surfaces in general .",
    "we only have to identify the proper vector field whose causal character is going to determine whether or not a given surface is trapped .",
    "it turns out that this is a well - known vector field called the _ mean curvature vector _",
    "@xmath133 , @xcite .",
    "one virtue of this characterization is that it can be used for imbedded submanifolds of any dimension and not only for co - dimension two , as has been traditionally the case .    for the purposes of",

    "this can be done in several ways , for instance , by using the explicit formula for @xmath133 given in @xcite in adapted coordinate systems .",

    "this operator happens to be directly related to the first variation of the ( vanishing ) mean curvature .",
    "marginally outer trapped surfaces , on the other hand , have a null mean curvature vector with one of the null expansions vanishing identically .",
    "they also extremize the area functional in the direction of the mean curvature vector , but the second variation is negative so that they are unstable with respect to this functional . nevertheless , considering that in the riemannian minimal case the operator was also associated to first variations of the vanishing mean curvature",
    ", one can consider the perturbation of the _ vanishing expansion _ ; this variation leads to another elliptic stability operator analogous to the previous one _ but _ with the important difference that it is not self - adjoint in the natural sense . despite this fact , a principal _ real _ eigenvalue can be defined and its sign rules the stability of the mots @xcite . a key fact here",
    "is that the second variation in the null mean curvature direction turns out to be algebraic , so that the entire variation of the vanishing expansion is ruled by a _",
    "unique _ differential operator .",
    "this therefore translates to co - dimension two marginally outer trapped submanifolds in higher dimensions .",
    "the parallelism between mots and minimal hypersurfaces in riemannian spaces can be explored further , and one can actually solve the plateau problem for mots , that is , the existence of mots spanning a given , prescribed , boundary @xcite .    after pioneering work by israel @xcite , in @xcite stable mots",
    "are proven to belong to dynamical horizons , which are _ spacelike _ future outer trapping horizons @xcite . actually , they belong to _ many _ such horizons , one for each chosen foliation by slices in the spacetime .",
    "one ends up with a pletora of mtt , which interweave each other in very complicated ways @xcite , leading to a problem of high non - uniqueness when talking about thermodynamical and other properties of locally defined black holes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , each mtt has a _ unique _ foliation by mtss @xcite unless the tube is null and constitutes an isolated horizon @xcite , in which case any cut of this null hypersurface is a mts . furthermore , stable mots classically perpetuate as such for some time @xcite .    despite their local definition and their interesting quasilocal properties ,",
    "closed trapped surfaces are also drastically non - local in many ways .",
    "it is known that they can not be seen in its entirety in the schwarzschild solution @xcite , however some of them can be actually fully seen in the oppenheimer - snyder collapsing model , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it might be the case that trapped surfaces associated to _",
    "stable _ mtt are not fully visible while those associated to non - stable ones are .",
    "more dramatically , in some examples one can prove that closed trapped surfaces extend far away from the intuitive region containing the black hole , even reaching flat portions of the spacetime whose entire past is also flat @xcite .",
    "this has been termed as the _ clairvoyance _ property of trapped surfaces @xcite , and raises the question of what is the boundary of the region in spacetime with closed future - trapped surfaces .",
    "such an innocent - looking and seemingly simple question has turned out to be very difficult to answer : not even in spherically symmetric cases this has been solved hitherto . the new concept of _ core _ of a black hole has thereby come up : a core of black hole is a minimal region that must be removed from the spacetime in order to get rid of all closed future - trapped surfaces @xcite . in other words",
    ", this is the indinspensable region that sustains the black hole .",
    "there are some hopes that the concept of core may lead to the characterization of a preferred future trapping horizon .",
    "as mentioned in subsection [ subsubsec : boundcond ] the formation of closed trapped surfaces in the evolution of realistic initial data has become an important area of research .",
    "a pioneering work in this respect is @xcite , then followed by many others such as @xcite were the stability was also analyzed . in @xcite",
    "the existence of open sets of initial data , termed `` short pulses '' , leading upon evolution to the formation of future - trapped surfaces was shown rigorously .",
    "an important improvement has been recently achieved in @xcite assuming ( more general ) initial conditions given on a null hypersurface .",
    "the proof requires estimates on just the first derivative of the curvature and weaker curvature controls .",
    "finally , the concept of closed trapped surface has also influenced the field of `` analogue gravity '' @xcite , where quantum effects in curved space - time are modeled by means of different physical systems , specially regarding the formation of `` horizons '' in fluid models .",
    "this was first considered in @xcite and much elaborated in @xcite , see @xcite for a review .",
    "as commented in subsection [ subsec : cc ] , given an asymptotically flat initial data hypersurface @xmath85 whose total ( adm ) mass is @xmath103 , penrose argued @xcite that if the data contains an apparent horizon @xmath92this is essentially a mots , see above , and if the inequality ( s ) 16 ( gm / c^2)^2= 16m^2 [ penineq ] ( now called the penrose inequality ) were violated , then the spacetime that comes from evolving the initial data would contain a naked singularity , implying a lack of predictability unknown in classical physical theories , or referring to subsection [ subsec : cc ] , a visibility of quantum effects in macroscopic gravitational collapse .",
    "thus initial data violating the penrose inequality would constitute a counterexample to weak cosmic censorship , while a proof of the penrose inequality would constitute evidence in favor of weak cosmic censorship .",
    "one can also use similar arguments if the initial data set @xmath85 is not asymptotically flat but rather intersects future null infinity ( asymptotically hyperbolic data ) by using the non - decreasing @xcite bondi mass for @xmath103 .",
    "early proofs for this case @xcite were incomplete as shown in @xcite , where some advances , still inconclusive , were presented .",
    "there are some subtleties concerning the lefthand side of ( [ penineq ] ) , as pointed out in @xcite and explicitly shown in @xcite , so that actually `` area '' there means `` the minimal area of any surface enclosing completely @xmath92 within @xmath85 '' .",
    "the heuristic argument penrose used in @xcite can be phrased in several different manners see for instance @xcite invariably invoking the singularity theorems to derive the inevitability of singularities whenever closed trapped surfaces are formed .",
    "the inequality ( [ penineq ] ) provides a lower bound to the mass of black hole spacetimes , and thereby is related to and strengthens the positive mass theorem @xcite of general asymptotically flat spacetimes . in this sense ,",
    "the rigidity part of the positive mass theorem the mass vanishes if and only if the initial data evolves into flat minkowski space - time has a counterpart in the black hole case : equality holds if and only if the initial data originates the schwarzschild space - time with the corresponding mass .    neither a proof of the penrose inequality nor a counterexample has been found in the general case , and even in spherical symmetry only a weaker version using the energy rather than the mass has been shown to hold @xcite . however , ( [ penineq ] ) has been proven in the so - called riemannian case",
    "@xcite which , from the space - time viewpoint , describes a time - symmetric situation , using the slice @xmath85 of time symmetry ( initial data with zero extrinsic curvature ) , for further details see @xcite . in this time - symmetric situation the surfaces to be used are actually minimal surfaces and the inequality ( [ penineq ] ) is sometimes referred to as an _ isoperimetric inequality _ @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the classical isoperimetric problem : to determine in euclidean space a plane figure of the largest possible area whose boundary has a specified length ( the perimeter ) . in euclidean space",
    "this leads to the classical isoperimetric inequality @xmath169 relating the length @xmath170 of a closed curve and the area @xmath16 of the planar region that it encloses , equality holding only if the curve is a circle .",
    "the inequality ( [ penineq ] ) has the virtue that everything depends only on the initial data set @xmath85 , and thus it has a neat geometrical content that can be studied independently of weak cosmic censorship or of any other physical requirement .",
    "this also follows from another independent argument presented by penrose @xcite using the mass @xmath103 of a thin shell collapsing into flat space - time at the speed of light .",
    "this surely produces a singularity , hence under weak cosmic censorship a black hole must form with an event horizon dressing it .",
    "one can then argue that ( [ penineq ] ) has to hold where now @xmath103 is the mass of the null shell . by using energy conservation across the shell , all the quantities involved in ( [ penineq ] ) can be computed directly _ in flat space - time _",
    ", thus leading to a pure geometrical inequality for surfaces embedded in minkowski space - time @xcite : the length side of the inequality is simply the integral over @xmath92 of its outer null expansion @xmath171 .",
    "such constructions have been analyzed in @xcite , proving that the inequality holds for @xmath92 lying on constant time hyperplanes and , using a result in @xcite , this can be extended to all mean convex bodies in euclidean space .",
    "a claim was made @xcite that this would settle the inequality for arbitrary surfaces but this can not be true , as clearly explained in @xcite .",
    "there exist stronger versions of the penrose inequality involving angular momentum , electric charge , and/or the cosmological constant @xmath0 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "some of these require , in order to make sense , that particular expressions under a square root are non - negative , providing some sharper versions of the positive mass theorem .",
    "in particular , the inequalities @xcite @xmath172 have been put forward , where @xmath104 is the total electric charge of the initial data set @xmath85 and @xmath107 its total angular momentum ( in geometrized units ) .",
    "the first of these inequalities was proven in @xcite , while the second only makes sense if the total angular momentum is well defined , that is , in axially symmetric situations @xcite . in this case , it has been shown to hold for vacuum and maximal initial data sets when the mts @xmath92 is connected @xcite .",
    "this also led to the so - called area - angular momentum inequality @xcite @xmath173 which was proven in @xcite .",
    "it also holds for totally geodesic null hypersurfaces foliated by mots @xcite .",
    "actually , a local version for stable sections @xmath92 of future trapping horizons was found in @xcite , see also @xcite for the inclusion of the cosmological constant .",
    "area inequalities involving charge can also be derived @xcite . for further details and a lengthy discussion on these matters",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the very same lightlike thin shell construction in flat space - time @xcite discussed above has also been used @xcite to test yet another inequality concerning black holes : _ the hoop conjecture_. this was originally formulated by thorne in a ( deliberately ) vague way as @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ black hole horizons form when , and only when , a mass @xmath103 gets compacted into a region whose circumference in every direction is @xmath174 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this statement is , to say the least , imprecise : notice the symbol @xmath175 . for a discussion of the many difficulties and the main problems that arise when trying to give a rigorous meaning to this conjecture , see @xcite and references therein . yet",
    ", the hoop conjecture has somehow managed to survive and , in a sense , be successful .",
    "it was settled in spherical symmetry @xcite , and discussed in more general cases in @xcite .",
    "a related mathematical result is that of @xcite where upper bounds for a radius of concentrated matter and lower bounds for its mass density are linked .",
    "this was used in @xcite to find conditions for the formation of future - trapped surfaces , however , examples in @xcite demonstrate that the underlying criteria are rarely met .",
    "the main physical idea here is that black holes are extremely localized objects , so that their energy / matter content must be severely compacted in all spatial directions . trying to make precise",
    "this idea is difficult , though .",
    "some specific formulations were given in @xcite , and a more recent precise one in @xcite .",
    "a mathematical viable reformulation of the conjecture have been presented in @xcite , where a long list of references can be consulted .",
    "are singularity theorems something of the past ?",
    "the answer to this question is a categorical ` no ' . the purpose of this last section is to give an idea of what is going on , of the new directions that are being explored , and of what is yet to be confirmed or improved .",
    "the whole subject has evolved and new versions , or new types , of singularity theorems are being built to take into account recent physical features such as higher dimensional theories , a ( positive ) cosmological constant , quantum effects , inflation , averaging , etc .      to start with , and as remarked in the discussion immediately after  theorem \" [ th : pattern ] , it would be convenient to prove the theorems under milder differentiability assumptions , for instance if the first derivatives of the metric are lipschitz functions , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "an important pre - requisite in that direction has been recently achieved in @xcite , raising some optimism in this line of research .    recently",
    "two theorems similar to penrose s one , but applying to infinite - space ( open ) cosmological spacetimes in which localized black holes may have formed were proven in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to assume that a closed trapped surface lies partly outside a black - hole horizon something possible in a cosmological , non - asymptotically flat , context . unlike the original theorem",
    ", the new theorems do provide some information on the location of the singularities .",
    "one conclusion is that the universe should contain causally disconnected regions .",
    "comparison results concerning the area and volume of sets can be applied to re - derive singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "singularity theorems requiring the existence of an ots , or a mots , rather than true ( marginally ) trapped surfaces have also been recently found @xcite even considering some generalizations of the concept of mots @xcite .",
    "one should also consider what happens when one or more of the hypotheses in the singularity theorems are relaxed , or suppressed altogether .",
    "this has recently been addressed in @xcite , trying to find theorems with milder conclusions , and considering the `` rigidity '' part of the singularity theorems , see also @xcite .",
    "this may open new lines worth to be explored .",
    "a very important line of research arises from the tension between the singularity theorems and the ( yet unfound ) theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it is widely accepted that the existence of classical singularities signal a breakdown of the classical theory at extreme conditions , which is precisely when gravitational quantum effects will become relevant .",
    "thus , there is a need to clarify if the singularity theorems , or part of them , can survive when entering into a quantum regime , or if they then simply vanish altogether . for a general discussion , see @xcite .",
    "a first step towards the analysis of singularity theorems in this respect is the weakening of the `` energy conditions '' also relevant in the classical regime , that is to say , finding an appropriate version of the curvature condition in the theorems .",
    "early results in this direction include the theorems based on averaged energy conditions @xcite as discussed in subsection [ subsec : thms ] , which were used to deal with the quantum violations of the energy conditions in @xcite , later improved in @xcite .",
    "a larger discussion can be found in @xcite ( and references therein ) and has been recently newly considered in @xcite , where an analysis of raychadhuri - like equations is performed proving that it is viable to have energy - momentum tensors which fail to satisfy even averaged energy conditions as long as an appropriate version of them with an exponential damping factor are in place .",
    "this leads to a proof of a version of the penrose singularity theorem allowing for _ global _ violations of the energy conditions .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that one may also need to go beyond semiclassical theories and take into account the quantum fluctuations of the space - time itself , adding extra difficulties to possible quantum singularity theorems .",
    "one problem here is that , classically , one relies on pointwise focusing of geodesics which can not be exactly true ( despite the smallness of the fluctuations ) in a quantum regime .",
    "the notion of closed trapped surface can also be generalized and adapted to quantum situations @xcite .",
    "the penrose singularity theorem can also be proven under these weaker circumstances .",
    "there is also the question of inflation in the past of the universe .",
    "effectively this implies a violation of the curvature condition in the theorems , and thus one can consider the possibility that actually the universe is past geodesically complete .",
    "this is not the case if the weak energy condition ( positivity of energy density ) holds @xcite , as already mentioned in subsection [ subsec : thms ] , but as discussed in the previous paragraph the weak energy condition can be violated in inflationary models due to quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this was addressed in @xcite with the result that , as long as an appropriate _ averaged _ hubble parameter is positive , violations of the weak energy condition are not enough to avoid past incompleteness of causal geodesics .",
    "inflation as well as the acceleration of the expansion of the universe are closely related to the existence of a positive cosmological constant @xmath11 , which is just the wrong sign for the curvature condition ( [ sec ] ) used in the focusing effect and , ultimately , in most singularity theorems . thus the need to direct some efforts to incorporate an explicit @xmath11 in the singularity theorems . for the case of compact slices ( closed case )",
    "this was studied in @xcite , see also @xcite , proving past geodesic incompleteness under some restrictions .",
    "the classical results in @xcite have been reconsidered in higher dimensions where the number of topological possibilities increases drastically @xcite .",
    "this is related to the topology of space @xcite and the topology of m(o)ts @xcite , and another theorem of this kind but using closed trapped circles was presented in @xcite .",
    "both a @xmath176 and _ averaging _ can be combined to obtain another form of singularity theorems for open cosmological models .",
    "as mentioned in subsection [ subsubsec : boundcond ] there are physically acceptable globally hyperbolic _ geodesically complete _ solutions of the field equations ( [ efe ] ) @xcite",
    ". some of these solutions can not describe the interior of finite stars : for perfect fluids this would require a timelike hypersurface with vanishing pressure , and this just does not happen in the solution @xcite , which also has everywhere - expanding cauchy hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "thus one wonders which conditions must a space - time satisfy to be geodesically complete . for _ stationary",
    "_ globally hyperbolic spacetimes this was answered in @xcite , and the timelike component of the ricci tensor ( for the preferred killing static observer ) behaves as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a spatial distance between any two events .",
    "this implies a fall off of the curvature for widely separated events .",
    "but , what about the dynamical , non - stationary , case",
    "? an important input into this problem was provided by raychaudhuri himself @xcite , who considered space - time averages of the physical quantities .",
    "he showed that non - rotating , singularity - free , open cosmological models , such as that in @xcite , must have vanishing space - time averages of the energy density and other relevant physical quantities .",
    "unfortunately , this is also the case for singular spacetimes such as the standard friedman models as was immediately noticed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , raychaudhuri was pointing into a very interesting direction : averaging of physical quantities .",
    "the key point is to consider _ spatial _ , rather than space - time , averages as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "one can thus prove @xcite that if there is a non - compact cauchy hypersurface @xmath85 whose expansion is positive everywhere ( with asymptotic non - oscillatory behavior , a technical condition @xcite ) , the energy density and the scalar curvature on @xmath85 are non - negative _ on average _ , @xmath176 and ( [ sec ] ) holds along the geodesic vector field orthogonal to @xmath85 , then the non - vanishing of any of the following scalars    * @xmath0 * the averaged energy density on @xmath85 * the averaged scalar curvature of @xmath85    implies that all timelike geodesics are past incomplete @xcite .",
    "hence , a clear , decisive , difference between singular and geodesically complete globally hyperbolic expanding open cosmological models is that the latter must have a vanishing spatial average of the matter variables .",
    "one could thus say that any geodesically complete model is not `` cosmological '' if we believe that the universe is described by a not too inhomogenous distribution of matter .",
    "this is , on the whole , a very satisfactory result .      from the discussion in subsection [ subsec : trapped2 ] we know that the concept of being trapped can be associated to submanifolds of any dimension in space - time , and not only to surfaces in 4 dimensions ( or co - dimension 2 submanifolds in arbitrary dimension @xmath134 ) .",
    "thus , a natural question is : why in theorem [ th : p ] one needs to assume a closed trapped _",
    "surface _ ?",
    "a partial answer is given by the hawking - penrose theorem [ th : hp ] , as one can assume either of    * a compact slice ( co - dimension 1 ) * a closed trapped surface ( co - dimension 2 ) * a point with reconverting light cones ( co - dimension 4 ) .",
    "but , what about _ co - dimension 3 _ ? why closed trapped circles",
    "do not show up in this theorem ? actually , this question is even more relevant in arbitrary dimension @xmath134 , as the number of possibilities increase . as remarked after theorem",
    "[ th : hp ] , the result holds in arbitrary dimension @xmath134 but then , why trapped submanifolds of co - dimensions @xmath179 are missing ?    this was discussed and answered in @xcite : the outcome is that one can certainly used trapped submanifolds of _ arbitrary _ co - dimension in theorems [ th : p ] and [ th : hp ] as long as the appropriate curvature condition is assumed .",
    "the key result is provided by the conditions to ensure the existence of focal points to the submanifold . using the notation in subsection [ subsec : trapped2 ] ,",
    "let @xmath136 be the spacelike submanifold of any co - dimension @xmath144 and @xmath180 a future - pointing normal to @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath118 represent a geodesic curve tangent to @xmath152 at @xmath136 with affine parameter @xmath181 ( @xmath182 at @xmath136 ) , and denote by @xmath183 the geodesic vector field tangent to @xmath118 ( @xmath184 ) . by parallel propagating along @xmath118",
    "the tangent vectors @xmath185 we construct a set @xmath186 of vector fields along @xmath118 ( @xmath187 ) . by construction @xmath188",
    "is independent of @xmath181 , so that @xmath189 .",
    "define then @xmath190 ( at @xmath182 this is the projector to @xmath136 ) .",
    "if the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) is initally negative @xmath191 and the curvature tensor satisfies the inequality r_n^n^p^0 [ cond ] along @xmath118 , then there is a point focal to @xmath136 along @xmath118 at or before the affine parameter reaches the value @xmath192 , provided @xmath118 is defined up to that point .",
    "it is easily checked that condition ( [ cond ] ) reduces simply to ( [ sec ] ) in the cases of co - dimension 1 or 2 @xcite . for co - dimension @xmath193 , the interpretation of ( [ cond ] )",
    "can be given physically in terms of _ tidal forces _ , or geometrically in terms of sectional curvatures .",
    "in physical terms , it is a statement about the attractiveness of the gravitational field on average : the tidal force in directions initially tangent to @xmath136 is attractive on average .",
    "the penrose singularity theorem [ th : p ] survives as it is simply replacing the closed trapped surface for a closed trapped submanifold of arbitrary co - dimension if one uses ( [ cond ] ) instead of ( [ sec ] ) .",
    "actually , just a milder averaged version of ( [ cond ] ) is enough @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hawking - penrose theorem [ th : hp ] holds by assuming a closed trapped submanifold of _ any _ co - dimension and ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "several applications of these generalized theorems are discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we would just like to mention a particular one concerning the possible _ classical _ instability of spatial compactified extra dimensions .",
    "this instability was suggested by penrose himself in @xcite .",
    "he argued that , due to the singularity theorems , singularities may develop within a tiny fraction of a second .",
    "his argument , though , needs some ad - hoc splittings , and some restrictions on the ricci tensor , because theorems [ th : p ] and [ th : hp ] were valid only for very few co - dimensions .",
    "those problems can be avoided by using the generalized theorems in @xcite as it is enough that the compact extra - dimensional space , or _",
    "any _ of its compact less - dimensional subsets , satisfy the trapping condition while the restriction on ricci curvatures can be replaced by the appropriate averaged condition on tidal forces . hence , the basic argument of penrose acquires a wider applicability and requires less restrictions .",
    "as exemplified in the previous sections , there are many exciting and interesting ideas being developed in several physical and mathematical areas which belong to the novel realm created 50 years ago by the penrose singularity theorem .    in conclusion ,",
    "the fertile line of research engendered in @xcite is , today , very much alive and vibrant .",
