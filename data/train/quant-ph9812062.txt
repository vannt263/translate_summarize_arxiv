    "there are two principal measures of quality in the quantum detection problem for a given finite number of quantum states with fixed prior probabilities .",
    "one is the minimization of a specified bayes cost , and the other is the maximization of the shannon mutual information @xcite . the former is useful if one has to reach a decision after performing a single quantum measurement whereas the latter is more relevant for the problem of transmitting as much classical information as possible using the given ensemble of states . in this paper",
    "we will consider the problem of maximizing the shannon mutual information for a certain class of quantum ensembles .    in a general communication setting ,",
    "let @xmath2 be input letters and let @xmath3 be their prior probabilities .",
    "let us denote output letters by @xmath4 .",
    "both the bayes cost and the shannon mutual information are defined in terms of the conditional probability @xmath5 of obtaining output @xmath6 provided that the letter sent was @xmath7 .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath8 for a bayes cost matrix @xmath9 $ ] , while the latter is defined as @xmath10 ( since all the results in this paper are valid for any logarithm base , we shall specify the base only where necessary . ) in classical information theory , the channel matrix @xmath11 $ ] is given and fixed , characterising the noise in the channel .",
    "in contrast , in a quantum information theoretic context where signal carriers are to be quantum states transmitted without noise , the channel matrix generally becomes a variable .",
    "this is because the act of quantum detection itself generally has a probabilistic output so the channel matrix is dependent on the choice of quantum detection strategy .",
    "more precisely , the input letters correspond to a set of positive trace class operators of trace one @xmath12 on a hilbert space @xmath13 . a quantum detection strategy",
    "is described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) on @xmath13 .",
    "a povm is any set @xmath14 of hermitian positive operators forming a resolution of the identity : @xmath15 the detection operator @xmath16 corresponds to the output letter @xmath6 and the conditional probabilities are given by @xmath17 thus in the quantum context the optimization of @xmath18 is carried out with respect to the choice of povm @xmath14 for fixed ensemble @xmath19 ( i.e. with fixed letter states @xmath20 and fixed prior probabilities @xmath21 ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath18 is called the accessible information of the ensemble @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath25 denote the mutual information obtained from the povm @xmath26 applied to the ensemble @xmath27",
    ". then if @xmath26 is a convex combination of povms @xmath28 : @xmath29 it follows from * ( conv ) * that @xmath30    the bayes cost @xmath31 is an affine concave function on the convex set @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the bayes cost minimization problem is a kind of linear programming problem and is expected to have a unique solution .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for specifying the optimum solution is known@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the shannon mutual information @xmath18 is a nonlinear and convex function on @xmath23 .",
    "the maximization of this quantity is a much harder problem and only a necessary condition for the optimum is known @xcite .",
    "thus the maximization of @xmath18 with respect to the detection strategy @xmath14 is a basic and open problem in quantum information theory . in this problem",
    ", the number of outputs is not necessarily the same as the number of the inputs .",
    "the optimum solution is not necessarily unique either .",
    "however it is known that there must be at least one optimum solution which corresponds to an extreme point of the convex set @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to the convexity of the function @xmath18 .",
    "such an extreme point is a set of rank one elements , which means that each @xmath16 has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a pure state and @xmath34 .",
    "the number of elements , @xmath35 , can be bounded by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath13 of which the input state ensemble @xmath12 is made @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is also possibly maximized at some interior points of @xmath23 as well . in that case",
    "the number of outcomes may exceed @xmath38 .",
    "explicit examples of optimal solutions have been given for binary ensembles @xcite and for the ensemble of four qubit states with tetrahedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the latter is a specific example of a general result of davies @xcite characterising the form of an optimal strategy for any symmetrical ensemble whose symmetry group acts _ irreducibly _ on the _ whole _ state space .    in this paper we will study the accessible information and corresponding optimal strategies for an ensemble @xmath0 of @xmath1 qubit states with symmetry group @xmath39 , the group of integers modulo @xmath1 .",
    "some of our results will also apply to more general ensembles .",
    "@xmath0 may be explicitly described as follows .",
    "let @xmath40 be the @xmath41-spin eigenstates and write @xmath42 .",

    "note that these states ( in the @xmath41-spin basis ) involve only _ real _ components . on the bloch sphere",
    "they are equally spaced around a great circle @xmath46 in the @xmath47 plane consisting of all real states .",
    "the antipodal points which have @xmath46 as equator , are the two @xmath48 eigenstates .",
    "thus @xmath0 is clearly symmetrical with respect to the group @xmath39 whose generator is represented by @xmath49 rotation about the axis joining the @xmath48 eigenstates . at the hilbert space level the operators @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ zm ] ) provide a projective unitary representation of @xmath39 ( e.g. @xmath51 and c.f .",

    "this symmetry group does not act irreducibly on the whole state space . indeed",
    "the @xmath48 eigenstates are left invariant by the group action .",
    "( irreducibility on the whole state space requires that the only invariant point is the maximally mixed state @xmath52 . )",
    "hence we can not apply davies theorem @xcite to provide an optimal strategy for @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless we will prove that the conclusion of davies theorem remains true in this case i.e. that there exists a pure state @xmath53 such that the @xmath39-symmetric povm @xmath54 is an optimal strategy for @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore we will show that @xmath53 may be taken to be the state orthogonal to @xmath56 .",
    "the case @xmath57 is of particular interest .",
    "it is the so - called trine ensemble which has been much studied @xcite .",
    "holevo in 1973 @xcite showed that no von neumann measurement in @xmath58 can be an optimal strategy , demonstrating the necessity of considering more general povms in quantum detection theory . since that time it has been conjectured that the strategy @xmath59 above is optimal for the trine source .",
    "our results resolve this conjecture affirmatively .",

    "we will show that the ensembles @xmath0 always have an optimal strategy with at most 3 elements and explicit strategies of this form will be described for all @xmath1 .",

    "we will also describe further optimal @xmath66-element povms where @xmath66 lies between 3 and @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by setting up a group - theoretic formalism for symmetric ensembles , leading to a main result ( theorem 1 ) which applies to symmetric ensembles of real states in any dimension @xmath67 .",
    "an essential requirement in many of our results will be that various states and unitary operators be _ real_. the requirement that a state or operator be real has of course , no intrinsic physical meaning .",
    "when we speak of real states and real operators we will always mean simply that _ there exists a basis of the hilbert space relative to which all the required objects simultaneously have real components or real matrix elements_.",

    "in this section we propose an optical scheme to demonstrate the optimal povms specified by @xmath343 for @xmath0 made of single mode photon polarization states .",
    "as seen in the previous section , @xmath343 has three outcomes at most and suffices to provide an optimal strategy for all @xmath0 s .",
    "for @xmath1 odd , it is always possible to find the optimal strategy with @xmath344 , that is , @xmath345 in theorem 2 if @xmath272 is taken as @xmath346 .",
    "we consider the implementation of this particular detection strategy .",
    "the measurement vectors can be represented by    @xmath347    [ vec_omega_m = n ]    where @xmath348 and @xmath349 and @xmath350 are orthonormal bases of polarization .",
    "the first step is to make orthogonal measurement vectors by embedding @xmath351 into a three or higher dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one possible physical prescription is to make an optical circuit with two input ports , say ,  a \" and  b \" .",
    "the signal state is guided into the port  a \" , while the port  b \" is initialized as the vacuum state .",
    "we can then consider the four dimensional hilbert space spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath352 ,    @xmath353    [ basis_e ]    where @xmath354 is the vacuum state and the subscripts @xmath255 and @xmath256 indicate the port @xmath355 and @xmath356 , respectively .",
    "a natural orthogonalization is    @xmath357    [ vec_omega_1 ]    or equivalently ,    @xmath358    [ vec_omega_2 ]    it is easy to check that @xmath359 give the same channel matrix as @xmath360 , that is , @xmath361 @xmath362 .",
    "the second step is to decompose the von neumann measurement @xmath363 into a unitary transformation followed by a measurement in the basis @xmath352 in order to find a practical detector structure .",
    "we may write    @xmath364    [ u+e ]    where @xmath365 and @xmath366 are given by the matrices @xmath367 @xmath368 in the @xmath369 -basis representation . eqs .",
    "( [ u+e ] ) mean that in the detector , the signal state @xmath370 is first transformed by @xmath371 , and is then measured in the basis @xmath352 which corresponds to the simultaneous measurement with respect to _ which - path _ and _ which - polarization_. the final step is to translate @xmath372 into a practical circuit .",
    "in fact , this unitary transformation can be effected by the simple circuit consisting of passive linear optical devices such as polarizing beam splitters , polarization rotators , and halfwave plates @xcite . the circuit is shown in fig .",
    "[ decoding_circuit ] .",
    "the @xmath371 part consists of four halfwave plates , two polarizing beam splitters , and two polarization rotators .",
    "the polarization rotator represented by the circle with the rotation angle @xmath373 performs @xmath374 the polarizing beam splitter represented by the square functions as a perfect mirror only for @xmath375-polarization ( fast axis polarization ) .",
    "light polarized along @xmath376-polarization ( slow axis polarization ) passes straight through it perfectly .",
    "the measurement @xmath352 is made by photon counting at the four output ports .",
    "note that only a single photon count at one of the three ports is expected and the outcome @xmath377 is never expected .",
    "this structure is valid for any @xmath1 ( the number of the signals ) if one tunes the rotation angle @xmath373 in @xmath378 according to the value of @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ angle_gamma ] ) ) .",
    "the circuit is simple enough to be implemented with present technology .",
    "we have considered optimal strategies for symmetrical sources of real quantum states , treating in detail the sources @xmath0 of @xmath1 real qubit states placed symmetrically in the @xmath47 plane around the bloch sphere .",
    "davies @xcite has provided a general theorem characterising an optimal strategy for any @xmath68-covariant source whose group acts irreducibly on the whole state space .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath39 of @xmath0 does not act irreducibly on that state space so davies theorem can not be directly applied .",
    "however we proved an extension of this theorem which applies to @xmath68-covariant sources of real states for which the group acts irreducibly on the subset of real states ( as is the case for @xmath0 ) .",
    "this led to a @xmath39-covariant optimal strategy @xmath60 for @xmath0 .",
    "we also derived alternative optimal strategies @xmath343 which contain at most three real povm elements . in deriving this strategy",
    "@xmath343 we exploited the convexity of @xmath18 on the convex set @xmath235 of all povms .",
    "these strategies are not @xmath68-covariant in general but correspond to extreme points of @xmath235",
    ". the small number of elements can be advantageous for practical implementation of the detection strategies as seen in the preceding section .",
    "the @xmath68-covariant strategy is not generally an extreme point of @xmath379 but for higher dimensions it would seem easier to derive explicit @xmath68-covariant solutions rather than extreme point solutions .",
    "our results have added to the relatively small number of quantum sources for which optimal strategies are explicitly known . they may be extended in various straightforward ways ( which we have omitted for clarity of presentation ) .",
    "for example the optimal strategies @xmath60 and @xmath343 for @xmath0 remains optimal for the @xmath1-state source @xmath380 where each pure signal has been corrupted by noise given by the maximally mixed state @xmath381 .",
    "this mixed state ensemble is clearly also @xmath68-covariant and the process of deriving the optimal strategy for this ensemble is quite the same as in the pure state case ( @xmath382 ) but just multiplying the cosine terms in eq .",
    "( [ mutinf ] ) by @xmath383 .",
    "then the same strategy remains optimal for the @xmath68-covariant mixed state ensemble although the accessible information decreases with @xmath384 as expected .",
    "it is perhaps worth briefly contrasting our results of maximizing the mutual information with the problem of minimizing the average error probability .",
    "the latter is defined for @xmath0 and any @xmath1-element povm by @xmath385 the @xmath386-optimal strategy is @xmath387 , that is , the povm based on the state directions themselves .",
    "this is true also for the above mixed state ensemble .",
    "( the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath388-optimality , as given in @xcite , are easily verified for @xmath389 . )",
    "generally @xmath388-minimization is an essentially different type of optimization problem from @xmath18-maximization .    within the confines of our formalism ,",
    "various interesting issues remain unresolved .",
    "for example we would like to know an optimal strategy for the real @xmath39-covariant source `` double-@xmath390 '' in 4 dimensions comprising the 2-qubit signal states @xmath391 .",
    "in this case the symmetry group @xmath39 does not act irreducibly even on the subset of all real 2-qubit states .",
    "interesting properties of double-@xmath392 have been considered in @xcite from the viewpoint of coding gain of transmittable information .",
    "it is also a remaining difficult problem to optimize a quantum channel over both the _ a priori _ probability distribution of signals _ and _ the detection strategy for a fixed set of quantum states .",
    "the solution is known only for the binary pure state channel .",
