    "it is easy to see that for @xmath31 to hold it is necessary @xmath32 has around infinity a laurent series expansion starting with @xmath33 .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to establish the strong asymptotics of the leading coefficients @xmath34 and the bergman polynomials @xmath35 , in @xmath28 , for non - smooth boundary @xmath10 . we do this under the assumption that @xmath10 is _",
    "piecewise analytic without cusps_. this means that @xmath10 consists of a finite set of analytic arcs that meet at exterior angles @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we allow @xmath10 to have corners . in this sense ,",
    "our results complement an investigation started by t.  carleman @xcite in 1923 , who derived the strong asymptotics under the assumption that @xmath10 is analytic , and was carried over by p.k .",
    "suetin @xcite in the 1960 s , who verified them for smooth @xmath10 .",
    "the techniques employed in both @xcite and @xcite are tied to the specific properties that characterize the mapping functions @xmath20 and @xmath38 in cases when @xmath10 is analytic , or smooth , and it turns out that they are not suitable for treating domains with corner . in order to overcome this",
    "we have developed an approach , which we believe to be novel .",
    "this approach involves , in particular , new techniques from the theory of quasiconformal mapping and a new sharp estimate , concerning the growth of a polynomial in terms of its @xmath39-norm .          above and in the sequel we use @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , e.t.c .",
    ", to denote non - negative constants that depend only on @xmath10 .",
    "we also use @xmath47 to denote the ( euclidian ) distance of @xmath48 from a set @xmath49 and call the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 , defined by ( [ eqinthm : finelambdan ] ) and ( [ eqinthm : finepn ] ) , as the _ strong asymptotic errors _ associated with @xmath8 and @xmath52 , respectively .    from ( [ eqinthm : finepnii1 ] ) and the well - known distortion property of conformal mappings",
    "@xmath53 see , e.g. , @xcite , we arrive at another estimate for @xmath51 , which does not involve the derivative of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath54    our next result provides an interesting link between the bergman polynomials and the problem of coefficient estimates in univalent functions theory .",
    "this result is established under the assumption that @xmath10 belongs to a broader class of jordan curves than the one appearing in theorem  [ thm : finelambdan ] , namely the class of quasiconformal curves .",
    "we recall that a jordan curve @xmath10 is _ quasiconformal _ if there exists a constant @xmath55 such that , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the arc ( of smaller diameter ) of @xmath10 between @xmath48 and @xmath58 . in connection with the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : finelambdan ] , we also recall that a piecewise analytic jordan curve is quasiconformal if and only if has no cusps .",
    "the assumption that @xmath10 is quasiconformal ensures the existence of an associated @xmath59-quasiconformal reflection @xmath60 , for some @xmath61 , which is characterized by the properties ( a1)(a3 ) stated in remark  [ lem : prop - qc ] below .",
    "the existence of the quasiconformal reflection was established by ahlfors in @xcite .",
    "all our estimates that are derived under the assumption that @xmath10 is quasiconformal are given in terms of the constant @xmath62 which in the sequel we refer to as the _ reflection factor of @xmath10 ( associated with @xmath63)_. we note that @xmath64 , with @xmath65 if @xmath10 is a circle .    in the next theorem",
    "we require , in addition , that @xmath10 is rectifiable .",
    "note that there are examples of non - rectifiable quasiconformal curves ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , any quasiconformal curve has zero area .",

    "then , for any @xmath9 , it holds that @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the area of @xmath0 and @xmath72 is the reflection factor of @xmath10 .    as it was noted above , theorem  [ thm : alphange ] provides a link between the problems of estimating the error in the strong asymptotics for @xmath8 and of estimating coefficients in the well - known class @xmath11 , consisting of functions analytic and univalent in @xmath73 that have a laurent series expansion of the form ( [ eq : psi ] ) with @xmath74 .",
    "this latter problem is one of the best - studied in geometric function theory ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    in another application , the result of theorem  [ thm : alphange ] can be used to discuss the sharpness in the decay of order @xmath75 , predicted for the sequence @xmath76 by theorem  [ thm : finelambdan ] .",
    "ideally , in order to show by means of theorem  [ thm : alphange ] that the estimate ( [ eqinthm : finelambdanii ] ) is sharp , it would suffice to find a domain @xmath0 , bounded by a piecewise analytic , and without cups , jordan curve @xmath10 , for which it would hold @xmath77 .",
    "in view of the estimate @xmath78 , for @xmath9 , however , which was obtained by gaier in @xcite for @xmath10 piecewise dini - smooth , this seems already tricky , because if @xmath10 is piecewise analytic ( even with cusps ) then is also piecewise dini - smooth .",
    "moreover , in view of the estimate @xmath79 , @xmath9 , with @xmath37 , which is established in section  [ subsec : coef - esti ] below , the use of theorem  [ thm : alphange ] for proving this kind of sharpness is of no help .",
    "[ rem : alphan - low - esti ] for any @xmath80 , there exists a domain @xmath0 , which is bounded by a piecewise analytic jordan curve @xmath10 , such that for the associated strong asymptotic error @xmath50 there holds @xmath81 for some positive constant @xmath82 and infinitely many @xmath9 .    this will be shown in a forthcoming article with the help of a domain @xmath0 whose boundary consists of two symmetric , with respect to the imaginary axis , circular arcs that meet at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , forming exterior angles @xmath85 , with @xmath86 . more precisely , in this case it can be shown that @xmath87 which , in view of theorem  [ thm : alphange ] , implies ( [ eq : alphan - low - esti ] ) .",

    "more precisely , for @xmath89 , there exists some subsequence @xmath90 of @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 it was shown by gaier in @xcite that clunie s curve is , eventually , quasiconformal .    the second example is generated by the function @xmath93 for any @xmath94 , this function maps @xmath95 conformally onto the exterior of a symmetric @xmath96-cusped hypocycloid @xmath97 , which is a piecewise analytic jordan curve with all exterior angles equal to @xmath98 , and thus not a quasiconformal curve .",
    "nevertheless , for each @xmath99 , @xmath100 provides an example of a cusped jordan curve , where @xmath101 .",
    "regarding numerical evidence , we consider the case where @xmath0 is the unit half - disk and display in table  [ tab : an - decay ] a range of computed values of @xmath50 , for @xmath102 .",
    "these were obtained from the exact value @xmath103 and the computed values of @xmath8 , after constructing in finite high precision and in the way indicated in section  [ subsec : arnoldigs ] below , the bergman polynomials up to degree @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we expect all the figures quoted in the table to be correct .",
    "the reported values of @xmath50 indicate that the strong asymptotic error for the leading coefficient decays monotonically to zero .",
    "in view of the estimate ( [ eqinthm : finelambdanii ] ) , we test the hypothesis @xmath105 .",
    "the reported values of @xmath106 in the table indicate clearly that @xmath107 .    exactly the same behaviour was observed in a number of different non - smooth cases , involving various angles and shapes . based on such evidence",
    ", we have conjectured the strong asymptotics for non - smooth domains in @xcite .",
    "based on the important applications of the ratio asymptotics outlined above ( see also section  [ sec : ftrr ] ) we reckon that the solution of the following problem will be of significance in developing further the theory of orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane .      since the property @xmath111**reg * * is equivalent to @xmath112 see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* thm 9.2 ) ) .",
    "a direct application of the ratio asymptotics for @xmath35 , given by corollary  [ cor : ratiopn ] , leads to the next two theorems .",
    "these refine , respectively , theorems  2.2 and 2.1 of @xcite , in the sense that they weaken the @xmath117-smoothness assumption on @xmath10 . for their proof , it is sufficient to note that : ( a ) the two theorems are equivalent to each other and ( b ) the reason for assuming that @xmath10 is @xmath117-smooth in theorem  2.2 of @xcite was to ensure the ratio asymptotics of the bergman polynomials ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "regarding existence and uniqueness , we note a result of davis and pollak @xcite stating that the infinite matrix @xmath128_{m , k=0}^\\infty$ ] defines uniquely the curve @xmath10 .",
    "corollary  [ cor : ratiopn ] and the discussion in section  [ subsec : arnoldigs ] , regarding the stability of the arnoldi gs process , suggest the following algorithm :      1 .",

    "we highlight the performance of the reconstruction algorithm by applying it to the recovery of three shapes , where the defining curves come from different classes : one analytic , one with corners and one with cusps , for which the theory of section  [ sec : ratio ] does not apply . in each case",
    "we start by computing a finite set of complex moments and then follow the four steps of the algorithm .",
    "we note that in all three examples the complex moments are known explicitly .    in figures  [ fig : ellipse][fig : cupsed - hypo ] we depict the computed approximation @xmath129 against the original curve @xmath10 .",
    "note that in the first two plots the fitting of the two curves is not far from being perfect . even in the cusped case , pictured in figure  [ fig : cupsed - hypo ] ,",
    "the fitting is remarkably close , despite the low degree of the moment matrix used .          in figure",
    "[ fig : square ] we reconstruct a square by using the complex moments up to the degree @xmath142 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath143 , so that the result can be compared with the recovery of a square , as shown on page 1067 of @xcite obtained using the _ exponential transform algorithm _ of the opus cited .",
    "this is another reconstruction algorithm based on moments . of course , for concluding results regarding the comparison of the two algorithms more experiments need to be contacted .",
    "in order to show that our reconstruction algorithm works equally well for domains where the theory above does not apply , we use it for the recovery of the boundary @xmath145 of the 3-cusped hypocycloid defined by ( [ eq : psi - hypom ] ) with @xmath146 . the application of the algorithm with @xmath147 and @xmath144 is depicted in figure  [ fig : cupsed - hypo ] .",
    "concluding , we note that the above algorithm is not suited for reconstructing unions of disjoint jordan domains , in contrast to the _ archipelagos reconstruction algorithm _ of @xcite . at the other hand , the simplicity of the construction and the proximity of the two curves @xmath129 and @xmath10 , shown in the figures , support that the proposed algorithm is more efficient when it comes to recovering single jordan domains .        the following result settles , in a certain sense , the associated coefficient problem for an important subclass of @xmath11 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive discussion of the coefficient problem for other subclasses of @xmath11 .",
    "[ th : bn - decay ] assume that @xmath10 is piecewise analytic without cusps and let @xmath36 , @xmath150 denote its smallest exterior angle .",

    "more precisely , the following array of equations can be readily verified by using ( [ eq : c_1 - 2 ] ) and arguing as in section  [ sec : proof - thm : hnomgae ] : @xmath155 for some @xmath156 .",
    "hence , we only need to estimate the integral @xmath157 this can be done by working as in deriving ( [ eq : iji ] ) . indeed ,",
    "by using the estimate @xmath158 we obtain @xmath159 and the required result ( [ eq : bn - decay-1 ] ) follows from ( [ eq : nbn - esti ] ) , with @xmath160 .",
    "an extremal domain , where ( [ eq : bn - decay-2 ] ) holds true , is provided by the case where @xmath10 is the canonical square @xmath161 , with vertices at @xmath162 , @xmath83 , @xmath163 and @xmath84 . in this case @xmath164 , and by making use of the rotational symmetry of @xmath161 it is easily seen that the schwarz - christoffel formula for the normalized conformal map @xmath148 takes the following expression : @xmath165 or , more explicitly , @xmath166 where @xmath167 , and @xmath168 denotes the binomial coefficient . hence , for @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 now , using the properties of the gamma function @xmath173 , it is easy to verify that @xmath174 and this , in conjunction with ( [ eq : bn - square ] ) , provides the required behaviour @xmath175 , with @xmath96-sides . in particular , ( [ eq : bn_equiv ] )",
    "holds true for any @xmath176 , @xmath94 , with @xmath177 and @xmath178 , @xmath170 .",
    "thus , any @xmath176 can serve as an extremal curve for the estimate ( [ eq : bn - decay-1 ] ) .",
    "in the case where @xmath10 is allowed to have cusps we recall , from section 1 , the following estimate of gaier @xcite : @xmath181 this shows that the arguments on the first part of the proof of the theorem can be amended to cover the case of zero exterior angles but not of angles of opening @xmath98",
    ".      in a different reading , theorem  [ th : bn - decay ] brings in a connection with operator theory . to testify this , we consider the toeplitz matrix @xmath182 defined by the continuous extension of @xmath69 to the unit circle @xmath183 . by this we mean the matrix @xmath184,\\ ] ] defined by the coefficients of @xmath69 in its laurent series expansion ( [ eq : psi ] ) .",
    "if the boundary @xmath10 is piecewise analytic without cusps , then theorem  [ th : bn - decay ] implies that @xmath185 , and hence that the symbol @xmath38 of the toeplitz matrix @xmath182 belongs to the wiener algebra ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this property leads to very interesting conclusions .",
    "for instance , to the conclusion that @xmath182 defines a bounded linear operator on the hilbert space @xmath186 and that @xmath187 where we use @xmath188 to denote the _ essential spectrum _ of a bounded linear operator @xmath189 .    consider next the multiplication by @xmath48 operator @xmath190 ( also known as the _ bergman shift operator _ ) , defined on the hilbert space @xmath14 .",
    "we note that @xmath191 is a bounded linear operator on @xmath14 , such that @xmath192 see @xcite .",
    "hence , from ( [ eq : essspt ] ) it follows that @xmath193 in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we employ results and tools from the present work to show that the connection between the two operators @xmath191 and @xmath182 is much more substantial .    in order to emphasize the importance of the bergman shift operator @xmath191 in the theory of orthogonal polynomials , we note that the proof of theorem  [ thm : ftrr ] relies heavily on the properties of @xmath191 ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that the stable arnoldi gs process is based on the use of the polynomial @xmath194 , i.e. , on the application of @xmath191 to @xmath195 .      here",
    "we refine the following estimate , which was derived in @xcite under the assumption that @xmath10 is piecewise analytic without cusps : for any compact subset @xmath49 of @xmath0 and for any @xmath9 , it holds that @xmath196 ( we use @xmath197 to denote positive constants that depend only on @xmath10 and @xmath49 . ) note that @xmath198 , if @xmath199 , for some @xmath200 , and hence for such cases , ( [ eq : pndecay - mss ] ) predicts a very slow decay for @xmath52 .",
