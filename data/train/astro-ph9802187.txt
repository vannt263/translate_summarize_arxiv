    "the fraction of luminous agns showing blueshifted absorption lines gives us the covering factor of the outflowing gas  but only if the sample is unbiased with respect to orientation .",
    "polarimetry and spectropolarimetry allow us to detect buried qsos in scattered light and thus to test orientation - dependent unified schemes for luminous agns , analogous to those for seyfert nuclei .    the statistical relation of blue - shifted absorption lines to orientation - dependent obscuration and scattering , and a comparison of line and continuum absorption in transmitted and scattered light paths in individual objects , constrain the geometry and physical conditions in the absorbing gas .",
    "we must first define an orientation - independent sample , and show that the qso central engines are actually the same kind , despite the different appearances at different orientations .",
    "unified schemes successfully explain the diverse appearance of agns by means of different viewing angles of an axisymmetric system .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the geometry deduced for the lower - luminosity agns ( seyfert nuclei ) , and some luminous iras agns ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; goodrich & miller 1994 , wills et al .",

    ", equatorial extinctions of perhaps several 100 in a@xmath3  effectively block the optical view of the central agn ( @xmath4  at 20 ) , but nuclear light scattered by electrons within the opening angle of the torus reveals a seyfert  1 continuum and broad emission lines in polarized light .",
    "in contrast , the first iras - discovered high - luminosity agn ( qso ) iras  13349@xmath52438 is viewed at a smaller _ i_. the total light spectrum looks like that of a normal qso , reddened , and with very weak narrow - line emission .",
    "however the percentage polarization p% is high and rises dramatically to the uv ( fig .",
    "this is a result of a normal unreddened qso spectrum seen in scattered , polarized light , diluted by an unpolarized reddened spectrum of the qso viewed directly , through absorbing dust .",
    "uv - optical surveys are incomplete because they miss qsos that lie within a dusty torus or are buried in a dusty galaxy . despite high absorption along the line - of - sight , buried qsos can be revealed in scattered ( polarized ) light .",
    "thus polarimetry and spectropolarimetry allow us to test unified schemes for luminous agns ( qsos )  to show whether the dusty hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( higs ) contain the same kind of active nucleus as the uv - optically selected qsos .",

    "this allows an approximately orientation - independent sample to be selected by warm ir colors .",

    "is high ( up to 26% ) .",
    "the polarized flux spectra show reddened qso continuum and blr . in the first group",
    "the scattered light is even redder than starlight , resulting in a characteristic increase in p% to longer wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , in the second group , the scattered qso continuum and broad lines are much less reddened , resulting in higher observed p% increasing towards the uv .",
    "all the remaining groups show qso broad lines and continuum in total and direct light . in the third group",
    "the total spectrum is reddened but p% increases to the uv  a result of a reddened direct view of the nucleus but much less reddened scattered spectrum .",
    "p% is generally quite high .",
    "narrow associated absorption or weak , broad absorption is seen in all these objects .",
    "the objects of the fourth group all have significant but low p% and at least 3 show low - ionization narrow and broad associated absorption .",
    "these spectra are less reddened than the preceding groups . at least in iras  07598@xmath56508 the broad emission lines are unpolarized .",
    "taking into account spectropolarimetry of other bal  qsos as well , apparently a lower inclination view of the nucleus results in multiple ( direct and scattered ) views of the qso nucleus . finally , the qsos of the fifth group appear as unpolarized , like nearly all of the 114 uv - optically selected pg  qsos ( berriman et al .",
    "1990 ) . on an axisymmetric torus model ,",
    "these are relatively unobscured qsos , viewed within the opening angle ( _ i _",
    "@xmath21 ) .",
    "broad - band polarimetry and spectropolarimetry of 12 qsos and 6 higs selected by warm 60  and 25  flux densities , and therefore essentially unbiased with respect to orientation , shows that these are analogous to the seyfert  1 and 2 classes at lower luminosities .",
    "spectropolarimetry reveals qso - like polarized broad emission lines and continua in all 6 higs .",
    "this means that a dust - orientation unified scheme holds for luminous agns , and the higs  the ` missing ' qso  2s  constitute @xmath230% of this population .",
    "the axisymmetric torus model is suggested by analogy with seyfert nuclei where radio - jets , ionization cones or dust disks define the axis , and , for iras 13349@xmath52438 , by the major axis of its host galaxy .",
    "however , the sequence we have described could be simply one of decreasing dust content .",
    "if dust content were greater for the more reddened objects , we would expect their l@xmath22  to be enhanced .",
    "a preliminary test of this is shown in fig .  2 where we compare the ratio l@xmath22/l@xmath23for the low et al .",
    "qsos with that for the optically selected pg qsos of the same bolometric luminosity .",
    "when corrected for line - of - sight reddening , l@xmath22/l@xmath23  ratios are the same for the ir- and optically selected qsos .    while the numbers are small and the number of higs is uncertain , from the different views at different inclinations we build a picture of a typical qso as follows : @xmath230% ( 6 higs ) of the center is covered by thick dust , @xmath240  45% by thinner dust ( groups 3 & 4 ) , with 20  25% of the qso relatively unobscured ( the 5th group ) . blueshifted absorption lines are associated with partially obscured views of the nucleus .",
    "only 3 - 4 qsos are sufficiently unobscured to have been selected in uv - optical qso surveys , so the true space density of qsos has been underestimated by a factor @xmath245 .",
    "webster et al . ( 1995 ) estimate that a similar fraction of radio - loud quasars ( 80% ) have been missed as a result of reddening .    on the axisymmetric torus model we can assign a relatively clear view within a cone of @xmath25 , a partially obscured zone with low - ionization absorbing outflows between @xmath25  and @xmath26 , and a thick dusty torus with @xmath27 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with half - opening angles deduced from spectropolarimetry of individual objects of the sample ( see references in table  1 ) .",
    "low - ionization absorbing outflows are related to dusty gas  neutral and warm ( see grupe et al . , mathur , this volume )  and",
    ", whichever dust - orientation unified scheme holds , they are much more common than previously thought .",
