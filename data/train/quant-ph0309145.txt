    "examples of information - theoretically secure protocols are : bb84 @xcite , b92 @xcite and epr @xcite . in particular , security of bb84 has been proven in @xcite .",
    "neither of these protocols can be entirely performed on a turing machine because they assume a quantum channel .",
    "such a channel is something rather exclusive .",
    "almost all of contemporary computing technology and communication infrastructure is classical .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of practical quantum repeaters , quantum channel is the main cause of severely limited range of the qkd @xcite .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to ask whether there is any classical it secure protocol .",
    "the answer to that is found in the theorem 1 .",
    "below , but first we need three definitions . + * definition 1 . * _ classical communication channel _ is a device which has one input and at least two outputs such that perfect copies of the information sent to the input appear at the outputs .",
    "+ * definition 2 . *",
    "a protocol is said to be _ classical _ if it assumes only classical channels and can be performed on a turing machine . + * definition 3 . *",
    "a key establishing protocol is said to be _ information - theoretically secure _ if it allows two legitimate parties , who do not share a secret initially , to establish with a high probability a common string ( key ) about which an adversary has only partial knowledge limited by the upper bound known to ( but not necessarily under control of ) the legitimate parties .",
    "+ for example the bb84 protocol followed by the information reconciliation @xcite forms an information - theoretically secure protocol .",
    "this definition is slightly weaker then the more common one which requires the legitimate parties to be able to limit the adversaries knowledge about the key to an arbitrarily small fraction of the key .",
    "however , the two are almost equivalent .",
    "namely , any protocol which fits the definition 3 can be complemented with the privacy amplification @xcite in order to satisfy the stronger definition , whereas any protocol that satisfies the stronger definition trivially satisfies the weaker one .",
    "we are now ready to prove the following theorem .",
    "+ * theorem 1 .",
    "* _ two parties initially sharing no secret can not establish a common string about which an adversary has only partial knowledge by a purely classical protocol . _",
    "+ other , more colloquial formulation of the theorem might be : `` all information - theoretically secure key establishing protocols ( in both weak and strong sense ) are quantum protocols . '' .",
    "+ * proof . *",
    "imagine the situation as in fig [ fig1 ] where alice and bob are connected with one classical and one quantum channel so that they can perform bb84 protocol .",
    "additionally , they are connected with channel(s ) necessary to perform another information - theoretically secure protocol named t. we assume that t is a classical protocol and prove , by _ reductio ad absurdum _ , that this can not be true .        in the setup in fig [ fig1 ] , eve is familiar with both bb84 and t protocols and can make perfect copies of information going through all classical channels connected to alice and bob , and is free to make attempts to tamper with the quantum channel . in order to establish a common secret key alice and",
    "bob perform bb84 protocol using the quantum channel and the public channel ( we assume bb84 protocol with polarized photons ) .",
    "each of them has a local non - deterministic random bit generator .",
    "this protocol goes like this : +    1 .",
    "alice generates two bits in order to encode one of the 4 possible polarizations of photon whereas bob generates one bit in order to choose one of the two polarizers ; 2 .",
    "alice sends polarized photon to bob ; 3 .",
    "at that moment eve who is tampering with the quantum channel tries to find out which photon state has been emitted by alice but she can not obtain full information because of no - cloning theorem ; 4 .",
    "bob receives the photon and measures it with his polarizer .",
    "the result @xmath0 is interpreted as `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' , according to the bb84 specification ; 5 .",
    "bob sends to alice the code of his polarizer , that is the bit he generated in the step 1 , through the public channel ; 6 .",
    "if bob s polarizer matched photon polarization ( meaning the measurement of the polarization was correct ) , alice sends `` ok '' and the bit @xmath0 is kept by both alice and bob , otherwise it is discarded .",
    "alice and bob repeat steps 1 through 6 any number of times to obtain each a string of desired length . 8 .",
    "when the desired string length is reached , alice anb bob perform information reconciliation , which results in the final shared key .",
    "this protocol is information - theoretically secure .",
    "its security relies entirely on the fact that eve can not make a perfect copy of state emitted by alice in the step 3 of each round , because no - cloning theorem @xcite of quantum mechanics applies to the quantum channel .",
    "however if the protocol t is secure then alice and bob can replace the quantum channel with t and perform a similar protocol in the following way : +    1 .",
    "alice generates two random bits , bob generates one random bit ; 2 .",
    "alice , instead of generating a photon simply sends her two bits to bob using classical protocol t ; 3 .   at that moment",
    "eve is listening to the protocol t but she can not obtain full information because t is information - theoretically secure ; 4 .",
    "bob receives the bits from alice , and calculates what he would measure in the case that alice did send him a real photon and he used real polarizer according to his previously generated bit .",
    "the result @xmath0 is interpreted as `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' , according to the bb84 specification .",
    "bob sends to alice the code of his `` polarizer '' that is the bit he generated in the step 1 through the public channel ; 6 .   if bob s bit matched photon polarization code ( meaning the measurement of the polarization would be correct )",
    ", alice sends `` ok '' and the bit @xmath0 is kept by both alice and bob , otherwise it is discarded .",
    "alice and bob repeat steps 1 through 6 any number of times to obtain each a string of desired length .",
    "8 .   when the desired string length is reached , alice anb bob perform information reconciliation , which results in the final shared key .",
    "this protocol also makes possible for alice and bob to obtain a partially secret key .",
    "but it differs from the first protocol only by the fact that the quantum channel in the step 3 .",
    "has been replaced by a classical protocol t. this in turn means that the effect of quantum channel in bb84 can be achieved entirely in terms of the classical protocol t which can not be true because no - cloning theorem does not have a classical explanation , q.e.d . +",
    "another way to prove the theorem 1 would be to show that an unknown quantum state could be cloned with a help of a classical information - theoretically secure protocol .",
    "it is the question of how the theorem 1 relates to the skapd protocol of maurer @xcite which is widely referred to being classical .",
    "maurer s protocol consists of three `` phases '' during which alice and bob ( and possibly eve ) communicate over classical channels .",
    "each phase ( advantage distillation , information reconciliation and privacy amplification ) is purely classical and can be performed on a turing machine .",
    "therefore it is tempting to think of it as being `` classical '' .",
    "but , the three phases alone are not sufficient for establishing the key : they can not even begin without alice and bob ( and eve ) having their initial binary strings .",
    "we are therefore coerced to conclude that there is another hidden but crucial `` 0-th '' phase . in the maurer s `` satellite scenario '' ( fig [ fig2 ] ) a satellite s emanates a weak signal of a random binary string , s@xmath1 .",
    "alice , bob and eve are `` connected '' to the satellite by separate channels in order to obtain three different ( but largely overlapping ) copies of a binary string .",
    "each of the parties uses its own copy to perform subsequent phases .",
    "crucial requirement in the 0-th phase is that eve can not copy ( without errors ) the information that is sent to either alice or bob .",
    "this means that , by definition , alice and bob are not connected to the satellite by classical channels .",
    "further requirement is that the satellite sends a very weak signal such that eve is not able to receive faithful copy of s@xmath1 ( in which case alice and bob have a zero chance of establishing the key ) .",
    "this requirement pushed to its extreme , by allowing eve to have better and better receiving antenna , would eventually lead to the requirement that the satellite should only send one quantum of electromagnetic radiation at a time , thus apparently realizing quantum channels with alice , bob and eve .",
    "one possible model of this low - power communication is that the satellite encodes zeros and ones with quantum states ( polarizations ) just the way alice does in the bb84 .",
    "but instead of sending only one photon per bit , it sends many photons of the same state ( per bit ) in all directions so that every participant would be able to receive multiple copies of the same state .",
    "having received multiple copies corresponding to a given bit , parties would be able to measure the state but still not with absolute certainty . at the end",
    ", parties would obtain similar but not equal copies of the initial string s@xmath1 , which is exactly what is required .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that the security of this phase ( in the present model ) clearly comes from the quantum effects but not from the no - cloning theorem because no - cloning theorem applies only to single measurement of an unknown state whereas here one is allowed to perform multiple measurements .",
    "+ scenarios other than the `` satellite scenario '' have also been worked out : for example digitizing of a publicly announced patch of the moon s surface , or listening to a known weak radio source in deep space , but no scenario is known in which zeroth phase is purely classical .",
    "+ to conclude , existence of the information - theoretically secure skapd protocol by itself does not contradict the theorem 1 .",
    "+ an additional support for the theorem 1 comes from the recent work of @xcite where striking equality has been found in noise thresholds for a family of quantum key - generating protocols and the skapd protocol indicating that these protocols might have more in common than previously realized .",
    "it could be argued that since we live in the quantum world all practical protocols are necessarily quantum . however , this is not what the theorem 1 is about .",
    "theorem 1 states that is is impossible to even _ imagine _ an information - theoretically secure protocol that would rely only on notion of classical channels and turing machines . and since today communications and computers are to a very high degree classical , it means that they are unsuitable for information - theoretically secure key establishing protocols .",
    "theorem 1 spells out a simple principle : information - theoretically secure protocols must rely on some quantum effect , but not necessarily the no - cloning theorem .",
    "by virtue of the theorem 1 no classical key generating protocol could ever be proven secure . to illustrate this",
    "it has been shown that a provably secure protocol skapd , previously thought to be classical , is in fact not entirely classical .",
    "on the other hand , quantum protocols which have been proven secure so far are very impractical because of limited range , expensive gadgetry and generally non - existing infrastructure of quantum channels needed to support them on a wider scale .",
    "while some of these limitations could be overcame with further technological development , we hope that the theorem 1 would inspire new ideas for more practical quantum protocols .      c. e. shannon , communication theory of secrecy systems .",
