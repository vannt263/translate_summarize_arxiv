    "; wilner et al . 1995 ) . additionally , a north - south velocity gradient in w3(oh ) is observed in the ch@xmath28oh channel maps of figure 4 , covering a velocity range from @xmath2948 to @xmath2941 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the first order moment image of ch@xmath28oh is shown in the right panel figure 5 , and it reveals the systemic velocity difference between w3(h@xmath0o ) and w3(oh ) . however , whether the velocity gradient is caused by outflow , disk , radial velocity differences of multiple sources , or binary rotation is still unclear .",
    "higher spatial and spectral resolution observations of multiple lines are needed to explain the velocity gradient .",
    "the rotation temperature diagram ( rtd ) method based on multi - transition observations is commonly used for determining physical parameters , in which population distribution of all energy levels of a specific species is described by a single excitation temperature and column density ( goldsmith & langer 1999 ) .",
    "rtd can be safely used in an homogeneous cloud with simple spectral profiles , optically thin emission , and a large spatial extension that completely covers the observing beam .",
    "however perfect homogeneous clouds are not observed in interstellar space , and complex density and temperature structures have been observed even in clouds with a simple morphology . under assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) ,",
    "the xclass program solves for the radiative transfer equation which takes source size , beam filling factor , line profile , line blending , background temperature , excitation , and opacity into account .",
    "the main difference between rtd and xclass fitting is that xclass can deal with opacity , line blending , and multiple velocity and spatial components .",
    "the detailed fitting functions and modeling procedures are described in the papers by comito et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and zernickel et al .",
    "the source sizes are derived by two dimensional gaussian fitting to the individual spatial components and converted to circular sizes .",
    "then , lte modeling is performed on the observed spectrum ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the systemic velocities , line widths , rotation temperatures and column densities of observed species derived with xclass modeling are listed in table 2 .",
    "the results show that different molecules have different rotational temperatures and column densities .",
    "the differences in the physical ( distribution in the cloud ) and chemical properties of the different molecules explain why not a single temperature is observed for all the species ( see review by van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) .",
    "note that in figure 2c , the predicted intensities for the lines with optical depths larger than 1 are stronger than those in the observed spectra , while the predicted intensities for the lines with optical depths less than 1 are coincident with the observed ones .",
    "for the optically thick transitions , one just sees the @xmath30=1 surface due to photon trapping , while the xclass models sum up all the contributions from the cloud linearly .",
    "multiple transitions of ch@xmath28cn and ch@xmath28oh spanning a wide energy range ( the upper level energies are labelled in figure 2 ) are observed in both w3(h@xmath0o ) and w3(oh ) , which can provide constraints on parameter estimation , especially for gas temperatures . in principle , the higher energy transitions will sample the emission from hot cores since these transitions are populated in conditions of high densities and temperatures , while the lower energy transitions can be excited in both the warm and the cool surrounding regions .",
    "therefore two components with different temperatures and column densities are needed to model ch@xmath28cn and ch@xmath28oh in the line abundant region w3(h@xmath0o ) .",

    "2010 , 2014 ) . compared with other organic species in these observations , ch@xmath28oh has the highest fractional abundance .",
    "similar cases are also reported in other star forming regions ( e.g. , ge et al . 2014 ; van der tak , van dishoeck & caselli 2000 ; qin et al .",

    "infrared observations suggest that ch@xmath28oh is the second most abundant ice species and has the highest abundance relevant to water ice with a fraction of 530% ( e.g. , dartois et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the high abundance of ch@xmath28oh indicates that this species may originate from grain surface chemistry ( charnely et al .",

    "the derived rotation temperature of 200 k for the warm component is consistent with that obtained by wyrowski et al .",

    ", ch@xmath28oh may originate from grain surface chemistry . if taking the abundance of ch@xmath28oh relative to water as 10% , one obtains hdo / h@xmath0o=1.6@xmath1410@xmath44 , which may indicate that w3(h@xmath0o ) is at an early evolutionary stage ( miettinen , hennnmann & linz 2011 ) .",
    "there are more lines in w3(h@xmath0o ) than in w3(oh ) .",

    "is optically obscured by a dusty cocoon ( wynn - williams et al .",

    "these features confirm that w3(h@xmath4o ) does present hot core properties .",
    "we have modeled the observed molecular lines using the xclass software , under the assumption of lte , and taking into account the source size , beam filling factor , line profile , line blending , background temperature , and excitation effects .",
    "rotation temperatures , column densities and fractional abundances are derived .",
    "generally , the rotation temperatures and column densities are higher in w3(h@xmath0o ) than in w3(oh ) .",
    "these properties indeed reflect physical and chemical differences between the two sources .",
    "the differences are caused by the fact that w3(h@xmath0o ) is a hot core , while the gas seen in w3(oh ) seems to come from the outer region of the hot cores located outside of the h ii region .",
    "the abundances of ch@xmath28oh , ch@xmath28ocho and ch@xmath28cn in w3(h@xmath0o ) is similar with those in the sgr b2(n ) hot core , the orion  kl hot core and compact ridge , suggesting that these molecules have similar chemical origins . among the molecules detected , ch@xmath28oh has the highest gas abundance , and the morphology of its lowest energy transition is coincident with that of the continuum , suggesting that it likely originates from grain surface chemistry .",
    "the abundance of ch@xmath28cn increases as temperature rises , and probably ch@xmath28cn was synthesized in high temperature gas phase reactions .",
    "non - detection and detection of some species such as hdo , o@xmath3cs , c@xmath4h@xmath34cn in the two cores may be related to their molecular abundance or evolution .",
    "vibrationally excited hcn and ch@xmath28cn were detected in w3(h@xmath0o ) , but not in w3(oh ) ; this is probably due to hot core environment of the w3(h@xmath0o ) .",
    "the estimated hdo abundance relative to h@xmath0o in w3(h@xmath0o ) is @xmath51.6@xmath1410@xmath44 , indicating an early evolutionary stage .",
