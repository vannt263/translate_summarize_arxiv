    "determining the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is nowadays one of the most important goals in high - energy nuclear physics . for a system of weakly interacting particles",
    "reliable results can be obtained from first - principle quantum field - theoretical calculations . unfortunately , for strongly interacting matter these tools provide only a limited amount of information .",
    "it is , however , possible to calculate the thermodynamical properties of such matter numerically from the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these lattice qcd calculations show that if the temperature is sufficiently high , the matter undergoes a transition from a confined phase where the relevant degrees of freedom are hadrons , to a deconfined phase where the degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons , the so - called qcd transition  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern have provided a wealth of data from which one could in principle obtain information about the qgp . however , to compare these data with lattice qcd results is not straightforward .",
    "so far , lattice calculations have provided reliable results for static thermodynamical properties of qcd matter , e.g.  the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the system created in heavy - ion collisions is , however , not static but dynamical , because it expands and cools in a very short time span of order @xmath2 seconds . obviously ,",
    "in order to be able to properly interpret the experimental results and infer the properties of qcd matter , we also need a good understanding of the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "fluid dynamics is one of the most commonly used frameworks to describe the space - time evolution of the created fireball , because the complicated microscopic dynamics of the matter is encoded in only a few macroscopic parameters like the eos and the transport coefficients .",
    "currently , fluid - dynamical models give a reasonably good quantitative description of transverse momentum spectra of hadrons and their centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "so far , most calculations assume that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 is constant , and they show that , in order to describe the azimuthal asymmetries of the spectra , e.g.the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 , this constant must be very small , of order @xmath4 .",
    "however , for real physical systems , @xmath0 depends ( at least ) on the temperature @xcite .",
    "a constant value of @xmath0 can only be justified as an average over the space - time evolution of the system .",
    "it is not clear how this average is related to the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .    in previous work @xcite , we have studied the consequences of relaxing the assumption of a constant @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the relevant temperature region where the shear viscosity affects the elliptic flow most varies with the collision energy . at rhic",
    "the most relevant region is around and below the qcd transition temperature , while for higher collision energies the temperature region above the transition becomes more and more important . in this work",
    "we shall extend our previous study and provide a more detailed picture of the temperature regions that affect elliptic flow as well as higher harmonics at a given collision energy .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our fluid - dynamical framework and its numerical implementation . in sec .",
    "iii , we specify the eos , the transport coefficients , and the initialization .",
    "sections iv and v contain a detailed compilation of our results , some of which were already shown in refs .",
    "we present the transverse momentum spectra and the elliptic flow of hadrons at various centralities with different parameterizations of @xmath0 as function of temperature .",
    "we also study the impact of different initial conditions and of the choice of the relaxation time for the shear - stress tensor . in sec .",
    "vi , we investigate evolution of the elliptic flow in more detail and , in sec .",
    "vii , find the temperature regions where @xmath3 and @xmath5 are most sensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and give some conclusions .",
    "we use natural units @xmath6 throughout the paper .",
    "in order to describe the evolution of a system on length scales much larger than a typical microscopic scale , for instance the mean - free path , it is sufficient to characterize the state of matter by a few macroscopic fields , namely the energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 and , possibly , some charge currents @xmath8 .",
    "fluid dynamics is equivalent to the local conservation laws for these fields , @xmath9    in the absence of conserved charges and bulk viscosity , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 can be decomposed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fluid four - velocity , @xmath12 is the energy density in the local rest frame of the fluid , i.e. , in the frame where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the thermodynamic pressure .",
    "the shear - stress tensor is defined as @xmath15 , where the angular brackets @xmath16 denote the symmetric and traceless part of the tensor orthogonal to the fluid velocity . with the @xmath17 convention for the metric tensor @xmath18 , the projector @xmath19 .",
    "if the system is sufficiently close to local thermodynamical equilibrium , the energy - momentum conservation equations can be closed by providing the eos , @xmath20 , the equations determining @xmath21 , and the transport coefficients entering these equations , e.g.the shear viscosity @xmath22 .",
    "the eos @xmath20 and the shear viscosity @xmath22 can in principle be computed by integrating out the dynamics on microscopic length scales .    while the conservation laws are exact for any system , the equations determining the shear - stress tensor require certain approximations , so that the only variables entering the equations of motion are those that appear in the energy - momentum tensor , namely @xmath12 , @xmath23 , and @xmath21 . in the so - called relativistic navier - stokes approximation ,",
    "the shear - stress tensor is directly proportional to the gradients of the four - velocity , @xmath24 we note that in this approximation the shear - stress tensor is not an independent dynamical variable .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation results in parabolic equations of motion , and subsequently the signal speed is not limited in this theory . in relativistic fluid dynamics",
    "this violation of causality leads to the existence of linearly unstable modes , which make relativistic navier - stokes ( ns ) theory useless for practical applications  @xcite .    a commonly used approach that cures these instability and acausality problems is israel - stewart ( is ) theory @xcite .",
    "in this approach the shear - stress tensor , the heat flow and bulk viscous pressure are introduced as independent dynamical variables and fulfill coupled , so - called relaxation - type differential equations of motion .",
    "assuming vanishing heat - flow and bulk viscosity , the relaxation equation for the shear - stress tensor can be written as @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the comoving derivative of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the expansion scalar .",
    "the shear - relaxation time @xmath1 is the slowest time scale of the underlying microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "formally , is theory can be derived by neglecting all faster microscopic time scales  @xcite . like @xmath1 , the coefficients @xmath29 can in principle be calculated from the underlying microscopic theory , i.e. , in our case qcd .",
    "unfortunately , for qcd the transport coefficients appearing in eq .   are still largely unknown . for the sake of simplicity , in this work we use @xmath30 ,",
    "obtained from the boltzmann equation for a massless gas  @xcite , and @xmath31 . the shear - relaxation time and the shear viscosity",
    "are left as free parameters .    instead of the full ( 3 + 1)dimensional treatment we consider a simplified evolution where the expansion in the @xmath32-direction is described by boost - invariant scaling flow  @xcite , i.e. , the longitudinal velocity is given by @xmath33 , and the scalar densities are independent of the space - time rapidity @xmath34 .",
    "here , @xmath35 is the time measured in laboratory coordinates . in this approximation",
    "the full evolution depends only on the coordinates @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the transverse coordinates and @xmath39 is the longitudinal proper time .",
    "once the initial values of the components of the energy - momentum tensor are specified at a given initial time @xmath40 , the space - time evolution of the system is obtained by solving the conservation laws together with the is equations .",
    "the conservation laws are solved using the algorithm developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and generalized to more than one dimension in ref .",
    "this method , known as shasta for  sharp and smooth transport algorithm  , solves equations of the type @xmath41 where @xmath42 is for example @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the @xmath47th component of three - velocity , and @xmath48 is a source term , for more details see ref .",

    "these results confirm our earlier conjecture : at rhic , the different @xmath0 parameterizations create very little difference in the elliptic flow in the early stages of the collision , while at later stages the suppression due to the hadronic viscosity takes over and groups the @xmath3 curves according to the hadronic viscosity . at the intermediate lhc energy the impact of the qgp viscosity is larger , and",

    "the hadronic viscosity has a similar impact on @xmath3 as the qgp viscosity . at the highest lhc energy",

    "therefore , in these simulations , in most of the temperature points , the change in @xmath0 affects @xmath125 through the space - time evolution , except at the lowest - temperature point @xmath134 mev , where the peak in @xmath0 is close to the freeze - out temperature @xmath56 mev .",
    "if we exclude the lowest temperature point in @xmath5 at rhic , we can read off from the figures that the temperature region where viscosity affects both @xmath3 and @xmath5 most is around the transition region @xmath135 mev . for @xmath3 this temperature region shifts slightly towards higher temperatures with increasing collision energy , while for @xmath5 the temperature where the effect is maximal is practically unchanged .",
    "other than this , the overall behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath5 is quite similar . at high temperatures ,",
    "the effect of @xmath0 increases with increasing collision energy , while at low temperatures the viscous suppression decreases with increasing collision energy , which is most notable for the @xmath134 mev point where the viscosity effects on the freeze - out distribution are strongest .    for @xmath3",
    "we observed earlier that the suppression due to the hadronic viscosity practically vanishes at the highest - energy lhc collisions .",

    "there is still a significant contribution from hadronic viscosity at the full lhc energy . in this sense , higher harmonics do not give direct access to the high - temperature viscosity , but can rather help in constraining the hadronic dynamics and viscosity as well as the correct form of @xmath60 .",
    "this is also important since the hadronic evolution always tends to shadow the effects of the properties of the high - temperature matter .",
    "we have studied the effects of a temperature - dependent @xmath0 on the azimuthal asymmetries of hadron transverse momentum spectra .",
    "we found earlier @xcite that the viscous suppression of the elliptic flow is dominated by the hadronic viscosity in @xmath90 gev au+au collisions at rhic , while in pb+pb collisions at the full lhc energy @xmath99 tev the suppression is mostly due to the high - temperature shear viscosity . in this work",
    "we have supplemented these earlier studies with more details .",
    "first , we found that the suppression of the elliptic flow due to the shear viscosity becomes more important in more peripheral collisions .",
    "at least in our set - up , for rhic energies a temperature - dependent shear viscosity improves the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow compared to the data , similarly to what was found in the hybrid approach of ref .  @xcite . with a constant @xmath67 and with the _ glmix _ initialization",
    ", the measured @xmath105 is reproduced in the most central collisions , but the calculations give a too large elliptic flow for peripheral collisions . however , with the _ bcfit _ initialization the elliptic flow in the most central collisions is reproduced with a temperature - dependent viscosity , and also the centrality dependence is reproduced down to the @xmath107 % centrality class . similarly , in pb+pb collisions at lhc both a temperature - dependent hadronic @xmath0 as well as an increasing @xmath0 in the high - temperature phase help in reproducing the centrality dependence . although there are lots of uncertainties associated with the decoupling and the initial state , at rhic the centrality dependence of @xmath105 may give access to the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in hadronic matter .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the effects of a temperature - dependent @xmath0 in a more detailed way .",
    "we found that for a given collision energy both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are most sensitive to the shear viscosity near the transition temperature , i.e. , @xmath136 mev . for @xmath3 ,",
    "this region moves slightly to higher temperature and widens with increasing collision energy , while for @xmath5 it remains practically unchanged .",
    "other than that , the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath5 on @xmath0 is similar with increasing collision energy : the effect of the hadronic viscosity decreases and the effect of the high - temperature viscosity increases .    for @xmath3 the effect of @xmath60 almost vanishes at the highest collision energies , but",
    "for @xmath5 it always remains significant . at rhic",
    "the @xmath60 corrections clearly dominate @xmath5 , and even at the highest collision energies this effect is comparable to the effects due to the modified space - time evolution . in this sense , higher harmonics give access to the @xmath60 corrections and the hadronic viscosity rather than the high - temperature viscosity .",
