    "higher - dimension interactions are usually assumed to be less important since they would be suppressed by a higher power of the ratio of the center - of - mass energy and the mass scale characterizing these interactions .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to study the effect of such terms since models might exist where higher - dimensional interactions are the dominating deviation from the standard model framework .",
    "recently , theories with large extra dimensions emerging in low - scale compactified string theories have been shown to constitute a viable alternative to the standard model @xcite",
    ". a specific class of these theories would predict deviations from standard model cross sections through the exchange of gravitons and their kaluza - klein excitations @xcite .",
    "the effect can be described with the help of dimension 8 nc contact terms @xcite , but there would also exist completely new kind of interactions like electron - gluon contact terms .",
    "scattering at hera @xcite ]    figure [ fig6 ] shows an example @xcite for the effect of graviton exchange with two choices for the relative sign of the standard model and new physics amplitudes compared to the large-@xmath2 data from h1 and zeus .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , with an integrated luminosity of 250pb@xmath34 for each of electron and positron scattering with left- and right - handed longitudinal polarization ( i.e.  1fb@xmath34 in total ) , hera could set limits slightly above 1 tev and would thus be competitive with lep2 ( expected 1.1 tev 95%cl limit ) , but slightly worse than the tevatron ( 1.3 tev ) .",
    "a future @xmath41 linear collider would be sensitive to mass scales above 4 tev and the lhc can be expected to shift the corresponding limit to 6.0 tev @xcite .",
    "leptoquarks appear in extensions of the standard model involving unification , technicolor , compositeness , or @xmath0-parity violating supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to their couplings to the standard model gauge bosons , leptoquarks have yukawa - type couplings to lepton - quark pairs which allow their resonant production in @xmath42 scattering . the generally adopted brw - framework @xcite is based on only a few assumptions concerning these yukawa interactions which lead to a rather restricted set of allowed states and the branching fractions @xmath43 for their decay to a charged lepton final state can only be 1 , 0.5 , or 0 . states which can be produced in @xmath44 or @xmath45 scattering have @xmath46 and for masses below 242gev they are excluded by tevatron bounds .",
    "renewed theoretical work on the phenomenology of leptoquarks ( see @xcite and references therein ) was initiated by the observation of an excess of events at large @xmath1 and large @xmath2 in the 199496 hera @xmath3 data which showed that the brw - framework may indeed be too restrictive .",
    "the crucial and least well motivated assumption there is that leptoquarks are not allowed to have other interactions besides their gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "in fact , most concrete models with leptoquarks do predict additional interactions which may lead to decay modes to other than lepton - quark final states .",
    "this would be interesting since for example the tevatron bounds do not exclude leptoquarks with masses above 200gev in scenarios with branching ratios @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "a few examples for more general scenarios have been discussed in detail in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model was proposed where two leptoquark states show mixing induced by coupling them to the standard model higgs boson .",
    "alternatively , interactions to new heavy fields might exist which , after integrating them out , could lead to leptoquark yukawa couplings as an effective interaction @xcite , bypassing this way renormalizability as a condition since this is assumed to be restored at higher energies . in the more systematic study of ref .",
    "@xcite , lq couplings arise from mixing of standard model fermions with new heavy fermions with vector - like couplings and taking into account a coupling to the standard model higgs .",
    "the most interesting extension of the generic leptoquark scenario is , however , @xmath48-violating supersymmetry which is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "searches at hera @xcite are essential to exclude such more general scenarios . despite of the strong dependence on the lepton - quark - lq yukawa coupling @xmath49 ,",
    "exclusion limits from hera experiments cover much larger mass values for small @xmath49 than those obtained from indirect searches at lep2 .",
    "since the dependence on the branching ratio in more general scenarios can be reduced considerably by combining nc and cc data , hera limits also supersede those from tevatron for small @xmath43 .",
    "the most recent published limits from h1 @xcite take into account the finite width of lq states and the interference of their production amplitude with the standard model background , both effects which turned out to be non - negligible for very large lq masses .",
    "scalar leptoquarks with masses up to 275gev and vector states up to 284gev are excluded at 95%cl for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "similar mass exclusion regions have been reported by zeus at recent conferences @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] @xcite , exclusion limits for the coupling @xmath49 at the same lq mass values can expected to be reduced by a factor of @xmath51 with 500pb@xmath34 of @xmath3 data . with this luminosity , limits on @xmath49 for much larger lq masses from hera will also come close to the limits following from atomic parity violation experiments via the corresponding induced contact interactions . to further extend the search to large lq - masses and small yukawa couplings , an increase of the center - of - mass energy of @xmath42 collisions ( for example like at tesla@xmath52hera )",
    "would be essential .",
    "many low- and high - energy experiments put limits on the couplings contained in @xmath62 @xcite ; however , they do not forbid interactions of the form @xmath67 proportional to @xmath68 in general , provided the @xmath69 are chosen to be zero at the same time .",
    "this makes squarks appear as leptoquarks which can be produced on resonance in lepton - quark scattering .",
    "in contrast to the generic leptoquark scenarios described above , squarks do not only decay into lepton - quark final states via their @xmath48-violating interactions but they can also decay into final states involving gauge bosons or gauginos . these @xmath48-conserving decays lead to a large number of interesting and distinct signatures ( see @xcite and references therein)-violating supersymmetry at hera have been improved recently @xcite . ] .",
    "characteristically one expects multi - lepton and multi - jet final states .",
    "mass and coupling parameters of @xmath48-violating supersymmetry can be varied such that the branching ratio @xmath43 for the decay into final states with charged leptons becomes small . in this case , the strict mass limits from tevatron would not exclude the existence of squarks in the mass range accessible to hera .",
    "in fact , searches at hera have not found a signal and bounds on some of the @xmath70 couplings have been derived from searches for the characteristic lepton @xmath71 multijet final states which supersede previous exclusion limits @xcite .",
    "most of the analyses done so far assume that only one of the couplings @xmath68 is non - zero and only one squark state is in reach .",
    "a more general scenario with two light squark states has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that @xmath72@xmath73 mixing would lead to a broader @xmath1 distribution than expected for single - resonance production .",
    "the possibility of having more than one @xmath74 was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite and deserves more theoretical study .",
    "@xmath48-violating supersymmetry has also played a role in the search for explanations of the observation made by h1 of five events with an isolated @xmath76 and missing transverse momentum @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "events of this kind can originate from @xmath13 production followed by the decay @xmath77 . their observed number is , however , larger than expected from the standard model taking into account next - to - leading - order corrections to the dominating resolved contribution from photoproduction @xcite .",
    "moreover , their kinematic properties are atypical for @xmath13 production @xcite .",
    "an explanation in terms of anomalous @xmath78 couplings additionally has to face limits from tevatron , lep2 and zeus @xcite and leaves the question open why a similar excess of events is not seen in @xmath79 events .",
