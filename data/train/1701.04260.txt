    "volatility , though not directly observed nor traded , is a fundamental object on financial markets , and has been the centre of attention of decades of theoretical and practical research , both to estimate it and to use it for trading purposes .",
    "the former goal has usually been carried out under the historical measure ( @xmath0 ) while the latter , through the introduction of volatility derivatives ( vix and related family ) , has been evolving under the pricing measure  @xmath1 .",
    "most models used for pricing purposes ( heston  @xcite , sabr  @xcite , bergomi  @xcite ) are constructed under  @xmath1 and are of markovian nature ( making pricing , and hence calibration , easier ) .",
    "recently , gatheral , jaisson and rosenbaum  @xcite broke this routine and introduced a fractional brownian motion as driving factor of the volatility process .",
    "this approach ( rough fractional stochastic volatility , rfsv for short ) opens the door to revisiting classical pricing and calibration conundrums .",
    "they , together with the subsequent paper by bayer , friz and gatheral , ( see also  @xcite ) in particular showed that these models were able to capture the extra steepness of the implied volatility smile in equity markets for short maturities , which continuous markovian stochastic volatility models fail to describe .",
    "the icing on the cake is the ( at last ! ! ) reconciliation between the two measures  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 within a given model , showing remarkable results both for estimation and for prediction .",
    "one of the key issues in equity markets is , not only to fit the ( spx ) implied volatility smile , but to do so jointly with a calibration of the vix ( futures and ideally options ) .",

    "@xcite double mean reverting process is the leading ( markovian ) continuous model in this direction , while models with jumps have been proposed abundantly by carr and madan  @xcite and kokholm and stisen  @xcite .",
    "this issue was briefly tackled by bayer , friz and gatheral  @xcite for a particular rough model ( rough bergomi ) , and we aim here at providing a deeper analysis of vix dynamics under this rough model and at implementing pricing schemes for vix futures and options . our main contribution is a precise link between the forward variance curve  @xmath2 and the initial forward variance curve  @xmath3 in the rough bergomi model .",
    "this in turn , allows us not only to provide simulation methods for the vix , but also to refine the log - normal approximation of  @xcite for vix futures , matching exactly the first two moments .",
    "finally , we develop an efficient algorithm for vix futures calibration , upon which we build a joint calibration method with the spx .",
    "as opposed to the cholesky approach in  @xcite , we adapt the hybrid - scheme by bennedsen , lunde and pakkanen  @xcite with better complexity @xmath4 . assuming the universality of the hurst parameter  @xmath5 across vix and spx allows us to compute efficiently prices recursively with complexity @xmath6 . in passing ,",
    "we also investigate the joint consistency of vix and spx in the market .",
    "the organisation of the paper follows accordingly : we first introduce the rough bergomi model and its main properties ( section  [ sec : rbergomi ] ) , before presenting its pricing power for vix futures ( section  [ sec : vixfutures ] ) , and finally develop the joint calibration algorithm in section  [ sec : jointcalib ] .",
    "comte and renault@xcite were the first to propose a stochastic volatility model in which the instantaneous volatility is driven by a fractional brownian motion , with a hurst index restricted to be greater than  @xmath7 .",
    "recently gatheral , jaisson and rosenbaum  @xcite presented a new approach with a hurst index smaller than  @xmath7 , producing extremely good fits to observed volatility data under the physical measure  @xmath0 .",
    "these models form the so - called rough fractional stochastic volatility ( rfsv ) family that is understood as a natural extension of the classical volatility models driven by standard brownian motion .",
    "our work focuses on the pricing measure @xmath1 and we assume through this paper that the model presented by gatheral , jaisson and rosenbaum  @xcite under @xmath0 is a reasonable model .",

    "we conclude that the approximation by bayer , friz and gatheral is accurate enough for practical purposes and yields and reduces significantly the computational costs since the computation of  @xmath181 involves a single integral while our approximation requires a double integral ( for  @xmath192 ) . in particular ,",
